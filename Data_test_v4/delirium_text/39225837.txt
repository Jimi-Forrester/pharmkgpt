39225837|t|The application value of Rs-fMRI-based machine learning models for differentiating mild cognitive impairment from Alzheimer's disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
39225837|a|BACKGROUND: Various machine learning (ML) models based on resting-state functional MRI (Rs-fMRI) have been developed to facilitate differential diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the diagnostic accuracy of such models remains understudied. Therefore, we conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis to explore the diagnostic accuracy of Rs-fMRI-based radiomics in differentiating MCI from AD. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, and Web of Science were searched from inception up to February 8, 2024, to identify relevant studies. Meta-analysis was conducted using a bivariate mixed-effects model, and sub-group analyses were carried out by the types of ML tasks (binary classification and multi-class classification tasks). FINDINGS: In total, 23 studies, comprising 5,554 participants were enrolled in the study. In the binary classification tasks (twenty studies), the diagnostic accuracy of the ML model for AD was 0.99 (95%CI: 0.34 ~ 1.00), with a sensitivity of 0.94 (95%CI: 0.89 ~ 0.97) and a specificity of 0.98 (95%CI: 0.95 ~ 1.00). In the multi-class classification tasks (six studies), the diagnostic accuracy of the ML model was 0.98 (95%CI: 0.98 ~ 0.99) for NC, 0.96 (95%CI: 0.96 ~ 0.96) for early mild cognitive impairment (EMCI), 0.97 (95%CI: 0.96 ~ 0.97) for late mild cognitive impairment (LMCI), and 0.95 (95%CI: 0.95 ~ 0.95) for AD. CONCLUSIONS: The Rs-fMRI-based ML model can be adapted to multi-class classification tasks. Therefore, multi-center studies with large samples are needed to develop intelligent application tools to promote the development of intelligent ML models for disease diagnosis.
