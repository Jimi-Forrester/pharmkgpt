36904242|a|A growing body of evidence suggests that vitamin supplements play a role in the prevention of cognitive decline. The objective of the present cross-sectional study was to evaluate the relationship between cognitive ability and folic acid, B vitamins, vitamin D (VD) and Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) supplementation. The sample consisted of 892 adults aged above 50 who were assessed for their cognitive status in the Shanghai Sixth People's Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine (China) from July 2019 to January 2022. According to the degree of cognitive impairment, the subjects were divided into a normal control (NC) group, subjective cognitive decline (SCD) group, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) group and Alzheimer's disease (AD) group. The results indicated a lower risk of AD in the daily VD-supplemented subjects with MCI compared to those who were not supplemented; a lower risk of cognitive impairment in those with normal cognitive who consumed VD, folic acid or CoQ10 on a daily basis compared those who did not; and a lower risk of cognitive impairment in subjects with normal cognitive performance who consumed B vitamin supplements, either daily or occasionally, compared to those who did not. The correlation was independent of other factors that potentially affect cognition, such as education level, age, etc. In conclusion, our findings confirmed a lower prevalence of cognitive impairment in those who took vitamins (folic acid, B vitamins, VD, CoQ10) daily. Therefore, we would recommend daily supplementation of vitamins (folic acid, B vitamins, VD, CoQ10), especially group B vitamins, as a potential preventive measure to slow cognitive decline and neurodegeneration in the elderly. However, for the elderly who have already suffered from cognitive impairment, VD supplementation may also be beneficial for their brains.
