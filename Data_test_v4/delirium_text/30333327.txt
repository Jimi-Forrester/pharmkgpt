30333327|t|Facilitating noncardiac surgery for the patient with left ventricular assist device: A guide for the anesthesiologist.
30333327|a|The introduction of left ventricular assist device (LVAD) has improved survival rates for patients with end-stage heart failure. Two categories of VADs exist: one generates pulsatile flow and the other produces nonpulsatile continuous flow. Survival is better for patients with continuous-flow LVADs. With improved survival, more of such patients now present for noncardiac surgery (NCS). This review, written for the general anesthesiologists, addresses the perioperative considerations when the patient undergoes NCS. For best outcomes, a multidisciplinary approach is essential in perioperative management of the patient.
