The blood-brain barrier (BBB), a special structure in the CNS, protects the brain from bloodborne pathogens via its excellent barrier properties and hinders new drug development for brain tumor. Recent breakthroughs in nanotechnology have resulted in various nanovehicless (NPs) as drug carriers to cross the BBB by different strategys. Here, the complex compositions and special characteristics of causes of brain tumor formation and BBB are elucidated exhaustively. Additionally, versatile drug nanovehicles with their recent applications and their pathways on different drug delivery strategies to overcome the BBB obstacle for anti-brain tumor are briefly discussed. Customizing nanoparticles for brain tumor treatments is proposed to improve the efficacy of brain tumor treatments via drug delivery from the gut to the brain. This review provides a broad perspective on customizing delivery nano-vehicles characteristics facilitate drug distribution across the brain and pave the way for the creation of innovative nanotechnology-based nanomaterials for brain tumor treatments.
