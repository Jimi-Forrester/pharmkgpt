31942556|a|Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are RNA molecules comprising more than 200 nucleotides, which are not translated into proteins. Many studies have shown that lncRNAs are involved in regulating a variety of biological processes, including immune, cancer, stress, development and differentiation at the transcriptional, epigenetic or post-transcriptional levels. Here, we review the role of lncRNAs in the process of neurodevelopment, neural differentiation, synaptic function, and pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). These pathomechanisms include protein misfolding and aggregation, disordered protein degradation, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, autophagy, apoptosis, and neuroinflammation. This information will provide the basis of lncRNA-based disease diagnosis and drug treatment for PD.
