36545813|a|BACKGROUND: Brain age is a popular brain-based biomarker that offers a powerful strategy for using neuroscience in clinical practice. We investigated the brain-predicted age difference (PAD) in patients with schizophrenia (SCZ), first-episode schizophrenia spectrum disorders (FE-SSDs), and treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS) using structural magnetic resonance imaging data. The association between brain-PAD and clinical parameters was also assessed. METHODS: We developed brain age prediction models for the association between 77 average structural brain measures and age in a training sample of controls (HCs) using ridge regression, support vector regression, and relevance vector regression. The trained models in the controls were applied to the test samples of the controls and 3 patient groups to obtain brain-based age estimates. The correlations were tested between the brain PAD and clinical measures in the patient groups. RESULTS: Model performance indicated that, regardless of the type of regression metric, the best model was support vector regression and the worst model was relevance vector regression for the training HCs. Accelerated brain aging was identified in patients with SCZ, FE-SSDs, and TRS compared with the HCs. A significant difference in brain PAD was observed between FE-SSDs and TRS using the ridge regression algorithm. Symptom severity, the Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale, chlorpromazine equivalents, and cognitive function were correlated with the brain PAD in the patient groups. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest additional progressive neuronal changes in the brain after SCZ onset. Therefore, pharmacological or psychosocial interventions targeting brain health should be developed and provided during the early course of SCZ.
