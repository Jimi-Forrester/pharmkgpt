34557270|a|Inflammation acts like a double-edged sword and can be harmful if not appropriately controlled. COVID-19 is created through a novel species of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV). Elevated levels of inflammatory factors such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), etc. lead to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and severe complications of infection in the lungs of coronavirus-infected patients. Astaxanthin is a natural and potent carotenoid with powerful antioxidant activity as well as an anti-inflammatory agent that supports good health. The effects of astaxanthin on the regulation of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) pathways and the reduction and suppression of cytokines and other inflammatory agents such as IL-6 and TNF-alpha have already been identified. Therefore, these unique features can make this natural compound an excellent option to minimize inflammation and its consequences.
