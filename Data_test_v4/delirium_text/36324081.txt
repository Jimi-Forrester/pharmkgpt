36324081|t|The effect of varying inhaled oxygen concentrations of high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy during gastroscopy with propofol sedation in elderly patients: a randomized controlled study.
36324081|a|BACKGROUND: Despite evidence that high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy (HFNC) promotes oxygenation, its application in sedated gastroscopy in elderly patients has received little attention. This study investigated the effect of different inhaled oxygen concentrations (FiO2) of HFNC during sedated gastroscopy in elderly patients. METHODS: In a prospective randomized single-blinded study, 369 outpatients undergoing regular gastroscopy with propofol sedation delivered by an anesthesiologist were randomly divided into three groups (n = 123): nasal cannula oxygen group (Group C), 100% FiO2 of HFNC group (Group H100), and 50% FiO2 of HFNC (Group H50). The primary endpoint in this study was the incidence of hypoxia events with pulse oxygen saturation (SpO2) <= 92%. The secondary endpoints included the incidence of other varying degrees of hypoxia and adverse events associated with ventilation and hypoxia. RESULTS: The incidence of hypoxia, paradoxical response, choking, jaw lift, and mask ventilation was lower in both Group H100 and Group H50 than in Group C (P < 0.05). Compared with Group H100, Group H50 showed no significant differences in the incidence of hypoxia, jaw lift and mask ventilation, paradoxical response, or choking (P > 0.05). No patients were mechanically ventilated with endotracheal intubation or found to have complications from HFNC. CONCLUSION: HFNC prevented hypoxia during gastroscopy with propofol in elderly patients, and there was no significant difference in the incidence of hypoxia when FiO2 was 50% or 100%. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This single-blind, prospective, randomized controlled trial was approved by the Ethics Committee of Nanjing First Hospital (KY20201102-04) and registered in the China Clinical Trial Center (20/10/2021, ChiCTR2100052144) before patients enrollment. All patients signed an informed consent form.
