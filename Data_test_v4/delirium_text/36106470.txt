MATERIAL AND METHODS: 60 extracted intact maxillary first premolars were collected and were randomly divided into five experimental groups as follows (n=12): Group A (negative control): no bleaching, Group B (positive control): bleaching with 40% hydrogen peroxide (HP), Group C: HP+-10% sodium ascorbate for 10min, Group D: HP+-10% alpha-tocopherol for 10min, and Group E: HP+-1% quercetin for 10min. Composite bonding was done immediately after bleaching for Groups B-E and without any treatment for Group A. After being stored in distilled water at room temperature for 24h, all specimens were tested for SBS in the universal testing machine. One-way analysis of variance and Tukey's post-hoc test were used to analyze the SBS values of all groups. RESULTS: The results showed that the bonding of composite to the unbleached group exhibited the highest mean value of SBS (22.68+-2.91MPa). Among the antioxidant-treated groups, the highest SBS value was detected in quercetin-treated specimens (15.45+-1.58MPa), which was significantly different from the positive control group (p<.05). CONCLUSION: It could be concluded that 10% quercetin applied for 10min increased the bond strength to bleached enamel, but it was not able to reverse it completely.
