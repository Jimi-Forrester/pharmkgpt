38750385|a|Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are often associated with depressive symptoms from the prodromal stage. The aim of the present study was to investigate the neuroanatomical correlates of depression in prodromal to mild DLB patients compared with AD patients. Eighty-three DLB patients, 37 AD patients, and 18 healthy volunteers were enrolled in this study. Depression was evaluated with the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI), French version 5.0.0. T1-weighted three-dimensional anatomical images were acquired for all participants. Regression and comparison analyses were conducted using a whole-brain voxel-based morphometry (VBM) approach on the grey matter volume (GMV). DLB patients presented a significantly higher mean MINI score than AD patients (p = 0.004), 30.1% of DLB patients had clinical depression, and 56.6% had a history of depression, while 0% of AD patients had clinical depression and 29.7% had a history of depression. VBM regression analyses revealed negative correlations between the MINI score and the GMV of right prefrontal regions in DLB patients (p < 0.001, uncorrected). Comparison analyses between DLB patients taking and those not taking an antidepressant mainly highlighted a decreased GMV in the bilateral middle/inferior temporal gyrus (p < 0.001, uncorrected) in treated DLB patients. In line with the literature, our behavioral analyses revealed higher depression scores in DLB patients than in AD patients. We also showed that depressive symptoms in DLB are associated with decreased GMV in right prefrontal regions. Treated DLB patients with long-standing depression would be more likely to experience GMV loss in the bilateral middle/inferior temporal cortex. These findings should be taken into account when managing DLB patients.
