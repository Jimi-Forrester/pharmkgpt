22228829|t|Sertraline for the treatment of depression in Alzheimer disease: genetic influences.
22228829|a|OBJECTIVE: To assess the potential for genetic influences on sertraline treatment efficacy for depression of Alzheimer disease (dAD). Four functional genetic variants were studied: 2 serotonin receptors (HTR2A-T102C and HTR2C-Cys23Ser), the serotonin transporter (5HTT-LPR), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF-Val66Met). Treatment response by genotype was measured by (1) the modified Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Clinical Global Impression of Change, (2) the Cornell scale for Depression in Dementia, and (3) remission of depression. METHODS: We utilized data from the Depression in Alzheimer's Disease Study 2 (DIADS-2), a 24-week, randomized, multicenter trial showing no significant treatment effect of sertraline on dAD. Proportional odds logistic regression and mixed effects models were used to examine the above mentioned outcome measures. RESULTS: No significant interactions were seen between any of the genetic polymorphisms and the selected outcomes above at 12 or 24 weeks. DISCUSSION: Treatment outcomes in the DIADS-2 trial were not significantly influenced by genetic variation at the loci that were assessed. Future studies should continue to examine the interaction of depression-related genetic variants with antidepressant treatment in Alzheimer disease patients with depression.
