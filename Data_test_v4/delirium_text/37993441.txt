37993441|a|Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mental disorder that develops after exposure to a traumatic event. Owing to the relatively low rates of response and remission with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors as the primary treatment for PTSD, there is a recognized need for alternative strategies to effectively address the symptoms of PTSD. Dysregulation of glutamatergic neurotransmission plays a critical role in various disorders, including anxiety, depression, PTSD, and Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, the regulation of glutamate levels holds great promise as a therapeutic target for the treatment of mental disorders. Electroacupuncture (EA) has become increasingly popular as a complementary and alternative medicine approach. It maintains the homeostasis of central nervous system (CNS) function and alleviates symptoms associated with anxiety, depression, and insomnia. This study investigated the effects of EA at the GV29 (Yintang) acupoint three times per week for 2 weeks in an animal model of PTSD. PTSD was induced using single prolonged stress/shock (SPSS) in mice, that is, SPS with additional foot shock stimulation. EA treatment significantly reduced PTSD-like behavior and effectively regulated serum corticosterone and serotonin levels in the PTSD model. Additionally, EA treatment decreased glutamate levels and glutamate neurotransmission-related proteins (pNR1 and NR2B) in the hippocampus of a PTSD model. In addition, neuronal activity and the number of Golgi-impregnated dendritic spines were significantly lower in the EA treatment group than in the SPSS group. Notably, EA treatment effectively reduced glutamate-induced excitotoxicity (caspase-3, Bax, and pJNK). These findings suggest that EA treatment at the GV29 acupoint holds promise as a potential therapeutic approach for PTSD, possibly through the regulation of NR2B receptor-mediated glutamate neurotransmission to reduce PTSD-like behaviors.
