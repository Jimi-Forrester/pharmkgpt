34707392|t|Risk Factors for Postoperative Mortality in Patients with Acute Stanford Type A Aortic Dissection.
34707392|a|OBJECTIVE: The present study explored the risk factors of postoperative mortality in patients with acute Stanford type A aortic dissection (AD). METHODS: The study included 149 patients with acute Stanford type A AD who were treated at the Fourth Hospital of Hebei Medical University, China, from October 2016 to October 2018. The patients were divided into a death (n = 42) and survival group (n = 107) according to individual prognosis. Univariate analysis of all possible related risk factors was conducted; multivariate logistic regression analysis of the potential risk factors that showed statistical differences in the univariate analysis was also performed. RESULTS: The results of the univariate analysis showed that a body mass index (BMI) >=25 kg/m2, surgery duration, duration of cardiopulmonary bypass, duration of cardiopulmonary bypass assistance, total transfusion of red blood cells, postoperative APACHE II score, sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, low cardiac output, acute kidney injury (AKI), hypoxemia, diffuse intravascular coagulation (DIC), hepatic failure and other related complications, as well as postoperative stay duration in the intensive care unit (ICU), were closely correlated with a poor prognosis among patients. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that a BMI >=25 kg/m2, SOFA score >8, duration of cardiopulmonary bypass assistance >70 minutes, postoperative low cardiac output, and postoperative DIC were independent risk factors for postoperative death in patients with acute Stanford type A AD. CONCLUSION: A BMI >=25 kg/m2, SOFA score >8, duration of cardiopulmonary bypass assistance >70 min, postoperative DIC, and postoperative low cardiac output were the independent risk factors for postoperative death in acute Stanford type A AD. Intraoperative blood transfusion, postoperative hepatic failure, and AKI, among others, correlated with an increased risk of death but were not independent risk factors for death.
