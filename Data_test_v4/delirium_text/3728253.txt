3728253|a|The variety of etiologic theories suggests that Alzheimer's disease may be multifactorial in origin. While the diagnosis is certain only at autopsy, a careful history and physical examination combined with relatively simple studies can exclude multi-infarct dementia and reversible forms of dementia, such as pseudodementia. Staging the clinical course facilitates management decisions. The family physician should provide as much nurturance as possible to family members who are caring for patients with this disease.
