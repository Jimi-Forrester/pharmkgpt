38206684|t|Semaglutide-associated hyposalivation: A report of case series.
38206684|a|RATIONALE: Obesity and diabetes of different types are considered global health risks with rising prevalence. In addition to low-calorie diet and daily exercise, several treatment options have been introduced to help patient in needs. Semaglutide (Ozempic) is one popular agent, which attracted the attention of both physicians and patients due to its positive outcome in improving glucose control and weight loss. However, no reports on the effect of semaglutide use on the oral cavity and specifically xerostomia are available in the literature. We are reporting 3 cases for patients who were using semaglutide and developed secondary xerostomia. PATIENT CONCERNS: Three female patients with median age of 34 (range 27-46) presented to the oral medicine clinic with chief complaint of xerostomia. All patients were overweight with a mean body mass index of 35.6 (range 35-37) and have been using semaglutide for weight loss for a mean duration of 11.3 weeks (range 6-16). DIAGNOSES: All 3 patients had severe dryness in the mouth with minimal frothy saliva with mean modified Schirmer test of 9 mL at 3 minutes (range 8-10 mL). Following exclusion of other possible underlying medical problems, the diagnosis of semaglutide-induced hyposalivation was given to all patients. INTERVENTIONS: The patients' management varied between discontinuation of the drug, the use of pilocarpine, and conservative symptomatic management. OUTCOMES: The patients resumed acceptable salivary flow. LESSONS: We are reporting for the first time hyposalivation associated with the use of semaglutide. Further prospective, larger studies are warranted to confirm these findings.
