17933157|t|Efficacy of risperidone for prevention of postoperative delirium in cardiac surgery.
17933157|a|This randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study was primarily aimed to evaluate the potential of risperidone to prevent postoperative delirium following cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass and the secondary objective was to explore clinical factors associated with postoperative delirium. One-hundred-and-twenty-six adult patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass were randomly assigned to receive either 1 mg of risperidone or placebo sublingually when they regained consciousness. Delirium and other outcomes were assessed. The confusion assessment method for intensive care unit was used to assess postoperative delirium. The incidence of postoperative delirium in the risperidone group was lower than the placebo group (11.1% vs. 31.7% respectively, P=0.009, relative risk = 0.35, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.16-0.77). Other postoperative outcomes were not statistically different between the groups. In exploring the factors associated with delirium, univariate analysis showed many factors were associated with postoperative delirium. However multiple logistic regression analysis showed a lapse of 70 minutes from the time of opening eyes to following commands and postoperative respiratory failure were independent risk factors (P=0.003, odds ratio [OR] = 4.57, 95% CI = 1.66-12.59 and P=0.038, OR = 13.78, 95% CI = 1.15-165.18 respectively). A single dose of risperidone administered soon after cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass reduces the incidence of postoperative delirium. Multiple factors tended to be associated with postoperative delirium, but only the time from opening eyes to following commands and postoperative respiratory failure were independent risk factors in this study.
