36831761|t|Amyloid-PET and White Matter Hyperintensities Have Independent Effects on Baseline Cognitive Function and Synergistic Effects on Longitudinal Executive Function.
36831761|a|Co-occurrence of beta amyloid (Abeta) and white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) increase the risk of dementia and both are considered biomarkers of preclinical dementia. Moderation and mediation modeling were used to define the interplay between global and regional Abeta and WMHs measures in relation to executive function (EF) and memory composite scores outcomes at baseline and after approximately 2 years across a sample of 714 clinically normal participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI 2). The moderation regression analysis showed additive effects of Abeta and WMHs over baseline memory and EF scores (p = 0.401 and 0.061, respectively) and synergistic effects over follow-up EF (p < 0.05). Through mediation analysis, the data presented demonstrate that WMHs effects, mediated by global and regional amyloid burden, are responsible for baseline cognitive performance deficits in memory and EF. These findings suggest that Abeta and WMHs contribute to baseline cognition independently while WMHs volumes exert effects on baseline cognitive performance directly and through influences on Abeta accumulation.
