37241705|t|Influence of Aluminum and Copper on Mechanical Properties of Biocompatible Ti-Mo Alloys: A Simulation-Based Investigation.
37241705|a|The use of titanium and titanium-based alloys in the human body due to their resistance to corrosion, implant ology and dentistry has led to significant progress in promoting new technologies. Regarding their excellent mechanical, physical and biological performance, new titanium alloys with non-toxic elements and long-term performance in the human body are described today. The main compositions of Ti-based alloys and properties comparable to existing classical alloys (C.P. TI, Ti-6Al-4V, Co-Cr-Mo, etc.) are used for medical applications. The addition of non-toxic elements such as Mo, Cu, Si, Zr and Mn also provides benefits, such as reducing the modulus of elasticity, increasing corrosion resistance and improving biocompatibility. In the present study, when choosing Ti-9Mo alloy, aluminum and copper (Cu) elements were added to it. These two alloys were chosen because one element is considered a favorable element for the body (copper) and the other element is harmful to the body (aluminum). By adding the copper alloy element to the Ti-9Mo alloy, the elastic modulus decreases to a minimum value of 97 GPa, and the aluminum alloy element increases the elastic modulus up to 118 GPa. Due to their similar properties, Ti-Mo-Cu alloys are found to be a good optional alloy to use.
