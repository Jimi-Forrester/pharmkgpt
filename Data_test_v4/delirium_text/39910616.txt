To expand our understanding about how late-onset AD risk might differentially influence males and females, this study explores how APOEepsilon4 affects hippocampal neurogenesis and microglia, key neuroplastic markers involved in AD pathogenesis, differently by sex in middle-aged rats. METHODS: A rat model expressing the humanized (h) APOEepsilon4 allele was characterized to examine markers of adult neurogenesis (neural progenitor cells and new-born neurons) and immune cells (microglia) in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus in 13 month-old male and female rats. RESULTS: We observed basal sex differences in neurogenesis at middle age, as wildtype male rats had greater densities of neural progenitor cells and new-born neurons in the dentate gyrus than wildtype female rats. Male hAPOEepsilon4 rats exhibited fewer neural progenitor cells, fewer new-born neurons, and more microglia than male wildtype rats. On the other hand, female hAPOEepsilon4 rats exhibited more new-born neurons than female wildtype rats. Interestingly, females had more microglia than males regardless of genotype. Correlations were conducted to further elucidate any sex differences in the relationships between these biomarkers. Notably, there was a significant positive correlation between neural progenitor cells and new-born neurons, and a significant negative correlation between new-born neurons and microglia, but only in male rats. CONCLUSION: In contrast to the clear pattern of effects of the hAPOEepsilon4 risk factor on hippocampal neurogenesis in males, females had unaltered levels of neural progenitor cells and increased density of new-born neurons. Furthermore, relationships between neurogenesis and microglia were significantly correlated within males, and not females. This suggests that females may be presenting a compensatory response to the hAPOEepsilon4 genotype at middle age. Collectively, these results exemplify the importance of thoroughly examining influences of sex on AD endophenotypes, as it may reveal sex-specific pathways and protective mechanisms relevant to AD.
