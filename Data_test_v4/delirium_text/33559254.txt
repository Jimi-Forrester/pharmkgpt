33559254|a|OBJECTIVES: To develop a reliable and valid measure of social connectedness among nursing home residents with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) using items available in the Minimum Dataset 3.0 (MDS). METHODS: We conducted a retrospective scale development study using the 2016 MDS with two populations of nursing home residents with ADRD: (1) new admissions (not post-acute care) (n = 146,694); (2) residents with comprehensive annual assessments (n = 294,704). Twenty-nine items were included for consideration. Psychometric evaluation included content validity, item analysis, internal consistency reliability, criterion-related validity, and exploratory factor analysis. Analyses were stratified by self- or staff-assessed pain. RESULTS: The resulting five item Social Connectedness Index (SCI) has good content (Fleiss Kappa = 0.67), criterion-related and construct validity and adequate internal consistency reliability (Kuder Richardson-20: 0.63-0.74) in persons with ADRD. As anticipated, younger residents, men, and those with severe cognitive impairment, anxiety, and depression were more likely to be categorized in the low social connectedness group. CONCLUSION: The SCI is a promising measure for estimating the amount of social connectedness present for nursing home residents with ADRD. Further work needs to be done to evaluate the usefulness of the SCI for evaluating health and well-being among this population over time.
