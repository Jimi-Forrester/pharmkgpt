22699459|a|The pathological changes of Alzheimer's disease include the deposition of amyloid beta protein (Abeta) as senile plaques in the brain. We hypothesized that the rapid removal of Abetas from the blood may act as a peripheral Abeta drainage sink from the brain. In this study, the plasma Abeta concentrations and the cognitive functions were investigated for in 57 patients on hemodailysis (69.4 +- 3.8 years), 26 renal-failure patients without hemodialysis (66.6 +- 14.7 years), and 17 age-matched healthy controls (66.6 +- 4.1 years). The concentrations of plasma Abetas increased along with the decline of renal functions. Moreover, the renal-failure patients without hemodialysis and with poorer renal functions showed lower cognitive functions. The plasma concentrations of Abeta(1-42) correlated with serum creatinine (P < 0.001) and Mini-Mental-State Examination scores (P = 0.017). The dialyzers effectively removed Abetas in the blood during hemodialysis sessions. The plasma Abeta concentrations showed steady or slightly decreasing along with duration of hemodialysis. The total amount of Abetas removed during a hemodialysis session was calculated to be comparable to the Abetas dissolved in the blood and the cerebrospinal fluid. The MMSE scores of the hemodialysis patients showed no clear decrease in longer hemodialysis duration. Therefore, the therapeutic approach for Alzheimer's disease by removing Abetas from the blood is worthy of further investigation, including whether or not Abetas in the brain decrease.
