7308749|t|Transient global amnesia.
7308749|a|3 cases of transient global amnesia (TGA) are reported. Transient ischaemia is probably the cause of the condition in the majority of cases although other mechanisms, particularly epilepsy, may be responsible in some. TGA may not be reported by the patient and may be misdiagnosed as a psychiatric disturbance. An acute confusional or delirious state can also produce an episode of amnesia with inability to remember events which occurred during the period of cerebral dysfunction. In TGA, however, there is an acute and temporary failure to record events without the evidence of more generalised dysfunction which occurs in delirium. During the 3 episodes reported here the patients were able to carry on with their everyday activities and to complete structured tasks, such as the preparation of a meal. TGA appears, at least in some individuals, to carry the prognosis of transient cerebral ischaemia.
