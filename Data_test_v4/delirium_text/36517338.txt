36517338|t|Role of Cardiac Anesthesiologists in Intraoperative Enhanced Recovery After Cardiac Surgery (ERACS) Protocol: A Retrospective Single-Center Study Analyzing Preliminary Results of a Yearlong ERACS Protocol Implementation.
36517338|a|INTRODUCTION: Enhanced recovery after cardiac surgery (ERACS) has been gaining rapid acceptance after multiple studies have demonstrated promising results in improved outcomes of enhanced recovery after surgery in other surgical fields (eg, colorectal, orthopedic, thoracic, etc). Cardiac surgery has several unique challenges, including sternotomy, cardiopulmonary bypass and associated coagulopathy, blood transfusion, and postoperative intensive care requirement. Nonetheless, selective cardiac surgical patients can still benefit from ERACS. Guidelines for perioperative care in cardiac surgery, previously published by the ERACS Society, are weighted heavily in preoperative and postoperative management without much focus on intraoperative care provided by anesthesiologists. To address this gap and to explore anesthesiology's contribution in achieving ERACS, the study authors' cardiac anesthesiology division, in collaboration with cardiac surgery, introduced the ERACS protocol in their institution in February 2020. METHODS: The cardiac anesthesiology division, in collaboration with cardiac surgery, introduced the ERACS protocol consisting of multimodal opioid-sparing analgesia, including the introduction of regional blocks, hemostasis management protocol, reversal of neuromuscular blockade, and administration of antiemetics in the authors' institution in February 2020. They have conducted a retrospective chart review study comparing patients who have received ERACS measures with a similar historic cohort who underwent cardiac surgery prior to initiation of an ERACS protocol. The primary outcomes of the study were to determine patients' time to extubation, postoperative opioid consumption, intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay (LOS), and incidence of postoperative complications (eg, postoperative nausea vomiting [PONV], bleeding, ICU readmission, delirium. RESULTS: The ERACS patients showed reduced opioid consumption (intraoperative fentanyl; postoperative fentanyl, as well as oxycodone, in the first 6 hours postoperatively), lesser mechanical ventilation (2.5 hours less), shorter ICU stays (5 hours less), shorter hospital LOS (1 day), and lesser incidence of PONV. None of the ERACS patients required blood transfusion. The study authors performed an anonymous survey among the anesthesiologists and ICU providers to assess providers' satisfaction, which showed 92% of survey takers agreed that the ERACS protocol should be continued for future cardiac patients, and 61% of survey takers reported superior pain control in ERACS group of patients while managing those patients. DISCUSSION: The ERACS is achievable after the careful implementation of a series of measures. It does not signify only fast-track extubation and opioid-sparing analgesia, and must be implemented in the entire perioperative period beginning from preoperative clinic to postoperative rehabilitation. Cardiac anesthesiologists play a vital role in execution of intraoperative ERACS measures. Both providers and patients themselves are key stakeholders. A larger randomized prospective trial is warranted to solidify the inference.
