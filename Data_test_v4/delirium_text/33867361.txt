33867361|t|The Impact of Hearing Loss on Clinical Dementia and Preclinical Cognitive Impairment in Later Life.
33867361|a|BACKGROUND: Dementia and cognitive impairment were significantly associated with hearing loss. The impact of hearing loss on dementia and cognitive impairment is understudied, particularly for different effect on cognitive impairment according to types of hearing loss. OBJECTIVE: The present study was conducted to elucidate the association between clinically diagnosed dementia and hearing loss with consideration of the type of hearing loss among an elderly population, and to explore the effects of different types of hearing loss on preclinical cognitive impairment. METHODS: Data (n = 59,675) from the Korean National Health Insurance Service-Health Screening were used to calculate odds ratios (OR) for cognitive impairment according to type of hearing loss (conductive, sensorineural, mixed, and noise-induced hearing losses, and presbycusis). Cognitive impairment was assessed using the Korean Dementia Screening Questionnaire-Prescreening (KDSQ-P). RESULTS: Cognitive impairment was significantly associated with conductive (OR: 1.45, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.20-1.77), sensorineural (OR: 1.23, CI: 1.12-1.36), and noise-induced hearing loss (OR: 1.32, CI: 1.12-1.56), and presbycusis (OR: 1.53, CI: 1.25-1.87). Among participants scoring positive on the KDSQ-P (score>=4), the KDSQ-P score was significantly elevated in the mixed and noise-induced hearing loss groups. CONCLUSION: This study revealed a significant correlation between different types of hearing loss and cognitive impairment. Noise-induced hearing loss is especially important because it occurs earlier than other types of hearing loss and has large effects on cognitive impairment.
