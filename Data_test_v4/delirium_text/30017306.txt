30017306|t|FRIEND or FOE: A prospective evaluation of risk factors for reintubation in surgical and trauma patients.
30017306|a|BACKGROUND: A Form for Re-Intubation Evaluation by Nurses and Doctors (FRIEND) was used to prospectively collect pre-extubation data, to determine failure of extubation (FOE) risk. METHODS: FRIENDs, including airway, breathing, and neurologic variables, were completed before extubation on trauma & surgical patients in one ICU from 1/1/16 to 5/31/17. Those with failed vs. successful extubation were compared. We excluded those with tracheostomy, comfort measures, or death before extubation. RESULTS: There were 464 eligible extubations in 436 patients. Thirty five reintubations (7.9% FOE rate) occurred in 32 patients within 96 h of extubation. FOE patients had higher ICU days (6 d vs. 2 d), ventilator days (6 d vs. 2 d), and mortality (15.6% vs. 2.7%) [all p < 0.001] compared to those without FOE. Odds of FOE (OR [CI]) increased with age (1.03, [1, 1.06]), delirium (3, [1.16, 7.76]), moderate/copious secretions (3.95, [1.46, 10.66]), and enteral opioid use (4.23, [1.28, 14.02]). CONCLUSIONS: Several characteristics present at the time of extubation were risk factors for FOE in trauma and surgical patients. Patients with FOE had higher mortality.
