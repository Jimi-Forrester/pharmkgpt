7211434|t|Delirium tremens: some clinico-chemical features. A study of alanine-aminotransferase, alcaline phosphatase, prothrombine and enolase.
7211434|a|The relationship between variables reflecting liver disease (serum-alanine-aminotransferase (SGPT), serum alcaline phosphatase and plasma prothrombine) and the clinical signs and symptoms during delirium tremens (DT; grade 3) and related clinical states (grade 2) was studied. Furthermore, it was investigated whether the two isoenzymes of enolase which predominante in brain tissue were present in plasma or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in DT patients. A correlation between SGPT and clinical state was not observed, which indicates that a causal relationship does not exist between acute liver cell damage and clinical state during DT of grade 3 or 2. In grade 2 patients, but not in grade 3 patients, both SGPT and serum alcaline phosphatase decreased between admission and recovery. This difference between the groups may be due to a higher alcohol consumption and a shorter interval between last drink and admission in grade 3. The difference in recent drinking history may also account for the finding of a higher plasma prothrombine index in grade 3 compared with grade 2, because chronic ethanol intoxication may be accompanied by enhanced hepatic protein synthesis. "Brain-enolase" was not present in detectable amounts in blood or CSF during DT thus suggesting that brain cell damage resulting in leakage of this enzyme from the cells did not prevail during DT.
