31882821|a|General theory of declarative memory formation posits a cortical-hippocampal dialog during which hippocampal ripple oscillations support information transfer and long-term consolidation of hippocampus dependent memories. Brain dementia, as Alzheimer disease (AD), is accompanied by memory loss and inability to form new memories. A large body of work has shown variety of mechanisms acting at cellular and molecular levels which can putatively play an important role in the impairment of memory formation. However, far less is known about changes occurring at the network-level activity patterns that support memory processing. Using freely moving APP/PS1 mice, a model of AD, we undertook a study to unravel the alterations of the activity of hippocampal and cortical circuits during generation of ripples in the transgenic and wild-type mice undergoing encoding and consolidation of spatial information. We report that APP/PS1 animals are able to consolidate spatial memory despite a major deficit of hippocampal ripples occurrence rate and learning dependent dynamics. We propose that these impairments may be compensated by an increase of the occurrence of cortical ripples and reorganization of cortical-hippocampal interaction.
