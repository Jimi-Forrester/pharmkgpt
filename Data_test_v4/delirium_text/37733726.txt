37733726|t|Incidence of adverse cardiovascular events in patients with insomnia: A systematic review and meta-analysis of real-world data.
37733726|a|Insomnia is a prevalent sleeping disorder associated with increasing cardiovascular (CV) mortality and morbidity. However, data incorporating recent clinical studies evaluating these outcomes is scarce. Hence, we aimed to investigate the association of insomnia with CV mortality, myocardial infarction (MI), all-cause mortality, and incidence of CV disease by conducting the first-ever meta-analysis of real-world data evaluating these CV outcomes. MEDLINE and Scopus databases were queried till August 2022 to identify studies comparing prespecified outcomes in patients with and without insomnia. The primary outcomes were CV mortality and myocardial infarction, while secondary outcomes included all-cause mortality, and CV-disease incidence. All data were pooled using an inverse-variance weighted random-effects model, and results were reported as relative risks (RRs) and p-values. 21 studies were analyzed. Risks for CV mortality and MI were significantly higher in patients with insomnia (RR 1.53, p<0.01, and RR 1.48, p = 0.03, respectively). The risk for all-cause mortality and CV disease incidence was also significantly higher in insomnia patients (RR 1.14, p = 0.03, and RR 1.31, p<0.01, respectively). Individuals with insomnia experience a higher risk of long-term mortality, MI, and incidence of CV disease.
