35944663|a|Severe COVID-19 is associated with the dynamic changes in coagulation parameters. Coagulopathy is considered as a major extra-pulmonary risk factor for severity and mortality of COVID-19; patients with elevated levels of coagulation biomarkers have poorer in-hospital outcomes. Oxidative stress, alterations in the activity of cytochrome P450 enzymes, development of the cytokine storm and inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) enzyme malfunction and renin-angiotensin system (RAS) imbalance are among other mechanisms suggested to be involved in the coagulopathy induced by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). The activity and function of coagulation factors are reported to have a circadian component. Melatonin, a multipotential neurohormone secreted by the pineal gland exclusively at night, regulates the cytokine system and the coagulation cascade in infections such as those caused by coronaviruses. Herein, we review the mechanisms and beneficial effects of melatonin against coagulopathy induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection.
