35513446|t|Therapeutic and tectonic keratoplasty with simple cryopreserved remnants of donor corneas: an 11 year retrospective case series.
35513446|a|This study sought to describe the use of deep-frozen donor corneal remnants preserved after keratoplasty procedures for therapeutic or tectonic keratoplasty without subsequent optical keratoplasty. This single-center retrospective consecutive case series analyzed the electronic medical records of patients who had undergone therapeutic or tectonic keratoplasty using deep-frozen donor remains preserved in Optisol-GS, for the past 11 years at Keimyung University Dongsan Medical Center. Fifty-five surgical cases in 46 patients were included. Twenty-three surgical cases in 18 patients underwent therapeutic keratoplasty for refractory infectious corneal ulcer. Complete eradication of primary infection was achieved in 14 patients (77.8%). Tectonic keratoplasty were performed 32 cases in 28 patients. Twenty-seven of 28 patients were ultimately able to maintain anatomical integrity (96.4%). Mean uncorrected visual acuity improved from 1.77 +- 0.94 preoperatively to 1.31 +- 0.95 at the last follow-up postoperatively in the tectonic graft group by logarithm of the minimal angle of resolution (P = 0.002). There were no cases of graft rejection. Keratoplasty using cryopreserved donor tissue is a suitable surgical alternative for infectious or non-infectious corneal ulcers in elderly patients or patients with poor general condition. It could be a viable alternative to overcome the shortage of corneal donors.
