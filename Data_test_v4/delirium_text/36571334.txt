36571334|a|In light of the rising evidence of the association between viral and bacterial infections and neurodegeneration, we aimed at revisiting the infectious hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease and analyzing the possible implications of COVID-19 neurological sequelae in long-term neurodegeneration. We wondered how SARS-CoV-2 could be related to the amyloid-beta cascade and how it could lead to the pathological hallmarks of the disease. We also predict a paradigm change in clinical medicine, which now has a great opportunity to conduct prospective surveillance of cognitive sequelae and progression to dementia in people who suffered severe infections together with other risk factors for Alzheimer's disease.
