We aimed to analyse the effect of 'social distancing' on the emotional state, post-operative pain and functional outcomes of patients undergoing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP). MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed data of male patients who underwent RARP within the study period (from March to April 2019 [Group A = 27 patients] and from March to April 2020 [Group B = 29 patients]). Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) results were collected on the first day of hospitalization. Post-operative pain was assessed using the numerical rating scale (NRS) and visual analogic scale (VAS) after surgery in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) and at 24 hours. Functional outcomes were evaluated at the one-month follow-up. Demographic, pathological and peri-operative data were collected for all patients. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in demographics and pathological characteristics amongst the groups. We observed that patients in Group A had a statistically lower value on the PHQ-9 and GAD-7 questionnaires than patients of Group B. Moreover, Group A showed statistically significant better post-operative pain control in PACU and at 24 hours. At one-month follow-up, patients in Group B required more diapers for incontinence than Group A, showing poor early continence. Patients in Group A showed interest in sexual rehabilitation after 1.11 +-.320 months while patients in Group B after 2.59 +-.712 months (p <.001). Moreover, 17 out of 29 patients (58.62%) in Group B were referred to an andrologist, compared to 100% of patients from Group A (p = 0.0006). CONCLUSIONS: Social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with a poor pre-operative emotional state, as well as influencing post-operative pain, early urinary continence and desire for sexual rehabilitation.
