34956937|a|Background: Diarrhea-associated-hemolytic-uremic-syndrome (D+HUS) is a common from of HUS. Central-nervous-system (CNS) involvement is one of the most common extrarenal organ involvements in children with D+HUS. This systematic review and meta-analysis aim to recognize the frequency of neurological complications in pts with HUS. Methods: Databases of PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science were searched systematically to find the papers on neurological involvement in HUS pts. Two researchers independently assessed the papers' quality and extracted data. CMA v. 2.2.064. was used for data analysis. Heterogeneity was evaluated using the I-squared (I2) test, and a fixed/random-effects model was used when appropriate. Results: In this review, 21 studies including 2,189 participants with a median age between 1.3-40-year-old, entered the meta-analysis. The meta-analysis in D+HUS patients indicated 27.0% with neurological complications (95% CI, 22.0%-32.6%), 25.5% of symptoms weren't categorized (95% CI, 15.9%-38.3%), 20.8% of them developed the seizures (95% CI, 2.3%-74.4%). In D-HUS pts, 20.8% of them were presented neurological symptoms (95% CI, 17.9%-24.0%), of which 29.0% weren't categorized (95% CI, 19.2%-41.2%), 17.5% of pts got into coma (95% CI, 9.6%-29.7%), 5.6 % showed hemiparesis (95% CI, 2.8%-10.9%), 17.2% experienced lethargy (95% CI, 5.2%-44.1%), 30.5% developed the seizures (95% CI, 18.2%-46.2%), 7.4% manifested speech abnormalities (95% CI, 0.2%-7.22%), 6.4% of D-HUS pts presented visual-disturbances (95% CI, 3.4%-11.6%). Conclusion: This systematic review and meta-analysis indicated more than one-fourth of both D+HUS and D-HUS patients were presented with neurological symptoms, and the most prevalent symptoms were seizures, which can lead to an epilepsy sequel.
