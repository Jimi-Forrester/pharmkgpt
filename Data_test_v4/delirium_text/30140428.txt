30140428|a|BACKGROUND: Primary cilia are small non-motile microtubule and cell membrane protrusions expressed on most vertebrate cells, including cortical and hippocampal neurons. These small organelles serve as sensory structures sampling the extracellular environment and reprogramming the transcriptional machinery in response to environmental change. Primary cilia are decorated with a variety of receptor proteins and are necessary for specific signaling cascades such as the Sonic hedgehog (Shh) pathway. Disrupting cilia structure or function results in a spectrum of diseases collectively referred to as ciliopathies. Common to human ciliopathies is cognitive impairment, a symptom also observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD). One hallmark of AD is accumulation of senile plaques composed of neurotoxic Amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide. The Abeta peptide is generated by the proteolytic cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). We set out to determine if Abeta affects primary cilia structure and the Shh signaling cascade. METHODS: We utilized in vitro cell-based assays in combination with fluorescent confocal microscopy to address our study goals. Shh signaling and cilia structure was studied using two different cell lines, mouse NIH3T3 and human HeLa cells. To investigate how Abeta levels affect Shh signaling and cilia structure in these cells, we utilized naturally secreted Abeta as well as synthetic Abeta. Effects on Shh signaling were assessed by luciferase activity while cilia structure was analyzed by fluorescent microscopy. RESULTS: Here, we report that APP localizes to primary cilia and Abeta treatment results in distorted primary cilia structure. In addition, we demonstrate that Abeta treatment interrupts canonical Shh signal transduction. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our study illustrates that Abeta can alter primary cilia structure suggesting that elevated Abeta levels, like those observed in AD patients, could have similar effects on neuronal primary cilia in the brain. Additionally, our study suggests that Abeta impairs the Shh signaling pathway. Together our findings shed light on two novel targets for future AD therapeutics.
