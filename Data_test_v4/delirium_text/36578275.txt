36578275|t|Early, Patient-Centered, and Multidisciplinary Approach in Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma: What Are We Talking About? A Case Description and Discussion.
36578275|a|Specialized palliative care (SPC) is a multidisciplinary need-based approach from the time a life-threatening disease is diagnosed. Patients with multiple myeloma (MM) will, at the time of diagnosis, often present with symptoms and needs that require a multidisciplinary approach. This case describes the course of a patient with newly diagnosed MM, involving all vertebrae and with no common analgesic treatment providing sufficient relief. High symptom burden and psychosocial and existential factors contribute to his total suffering. SPC, anesthesiological, and radio-oncological disciplines are integrated early, and the multidisciplinary approach includes support from social worker, psychologist, and physiotherapist. The needs and distress of the patients' wife are addressed. Barriers for further integration and the role of standardized care pathways are discussed, and the importance of systematic screening for symptoms and needs is highlighted. Integrating several disciplines may be a prerequisite for antineoplastic treatment being initiated for patients with newly diagnosed malignant disease.
