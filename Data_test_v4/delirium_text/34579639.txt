34579639|a|Age-related Neurological Disorders (ANDs) involve Neurodegenerative Diseases (NDDs), such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD), the most frequent kind of dementia in elderly people, and Parkinson's Disease (PD), and also other disorders like epilepsy and migraine. Although ANDs are multifactorial, aging is a principal risk factor for them. The common and most main pathologic features among ANDs are inflammation, oxidative stress, and misfolded proteins accumulation. Since failing brains caused by ANDs impose a notable burden on public health and their incidence is increasing, a lot of works have been conducted to overcome them. Garlic, Allium sativum, has been used for different medical purposes globally and more than thousands of publications have reported its health benefits. Garlic and aged garlic extract are considered potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidants agents and can have remarkable neuroprotective effects. This review is aimed to summarize knowledge on the pharmacotherapeutic potential of garlic and its components in ANDs.
