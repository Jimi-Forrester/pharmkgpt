34793991|t|Spectrum of neuroimaging mimics in children with COVID-19 infection.
34793991|a|Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, has affected over 200 million people globally (including over 30 million people in the United States), with children comprising 12.9% of reported cases in the United States. In children, COVID-19 infection appears to be associated with mild respiratory symptoms; however, serious neurological complications may occur in conjunction with multisystem inflammatory syndrome. A wide spectrum of neurological diseases have been observed in children with COVID-19 infection including encephalitis, acute necrotizing encephalopathy, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, cytotoxic lesion of the callosal splenium, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, venous sinus thrombosis, vasculitis and infarction, Guillain-Barre syndrome, transverse myelitis, and myositis. This review describes the characteristic magnetic resonance neuroimaging features of these diseases and their differentiations from other imaging mimics. In addition, we review the possible pathophysiology underlying the association between these diseases and COVID-19-infection. As new SARS-CoV-2 variants emerge and COVID-19 infection continues to spread worldwide, pediatricians, radiologists, and first-line care givers should be aware of possible neurological diseases associated with COVID-19 infection when these reported neuroimaging patterns are observed in children during this pandemic.
