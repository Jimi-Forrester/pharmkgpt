8668611|a|Delirium is a common medical condition, especially in elderly hospitalized patients. The syndrome is characterized by a short course of confusion and changes in perception and behavior. Early detection can be enhanced by routine assessment of cognitive functioning in hospitalized patients, especially those at risk for delirium. Prompt recognition and aggressive treatment of the underlying cause are essential for a positive outcome. Supportive measures are designed to calm and protect the patient and provide symptomatic relief until the precipitating condition is corrected.
