32928063|a|Porphyromonas gingivalis, a prominent pathogen responsible for acute periodontal diseases, is widely studied by the scientific community for its successful evasion of the host immune system. P. gingivalis is associated with rheumatoid arthritis, dementia, and Alzheimer's. The pathogen successfully survives itself against the heavy load of conventional antibiotics because of its ability to evade the host immune system. Subtractive proteomics and reverse vaccinology approaches were employed in order to prioritize the best proteins for vaccine designing. Three vaccine candidates with Uniprot ID: Q7MWZ2 (histidine Kinase), Q7MVL1 (Fe (2+) transporter), and Q7MWZ2 (Capsular polysaccharide transport protein) were identified for vaccine designing. These proteins are antigenic and essential for pathogen survival. A wide range of immunoinformatics tools was applied for the prediction of epitopes, B, and T cells, for the vaccine candidate proteins. Molecular docking of the predicted epitopes against the MHC molecules were carried out. In-silico vaccine was constructed using carefully evaluated epitopes and consequently modeled for docking with human Toll-like receptor 2. Chain C of Pam3CSK4 (PDB ID; 2Z7X) was linked to the vaccine as an adjuvant to boost immune response towards the vaccine. For stability evaluation of the vaccine-TLR-2 docked complex, Molecular Dynamics simulations were performed. The reverse-translated nucleotide sequence cloned in Eschericia coli to attain the maximal expression of the vaccine protein. The maximal expression was ensured by CAI score of 0.96. The current vaccine requires future experimental validation to confirm its effectiveness. The vaccine developed will be helpful to protect against P. gingivalis associated infections.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.
