39088030|t|Omaveloxolone Ameliorates Cognitive Deficits by Inhibiting Apoptosis and Neuroinflammation in APP/PS1 Mice.
39088030|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease associated with aging, characterized by progressive cognitive impairment and memory loss. However, treatments that delay AD progression or improve its symptoms remain limited. The aim of the present study was to investigate the therapeutic effects of omaveloxolone (Omav) on AD and to explore the underlying mechanisms. Thirty-week-old APP/PS1 mice were selected as an experimental model of AD. The spatial learning and memory abilities were tested using the Morris water maze. Amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposition in the brains was measured using immunohistochemistry. Network pharmacological analyses and molecular docking were conducted to gain insights into the therapeutic mechanisms of Omav. Finally, validation analyses were conducted to detect changes in the associated pathways and proteins. Our finding revealed that Omav markedly rescued cognitive dysfunction and reduced Abeta deposition in the brains of APP/PS1 mice. Network pharmacological analysis identified 112 intersecting genes, with CASP3 and MTOR emerging as the key targets. In vivo validation experiments indicated that Omav attenuated neuronal apoptosis by regulating apoptotic proteins, including caspase 3, Bax, and Bcl-2. Moreover, Omav suppressed neuroinflammation and induced autophagy by inhibiting the phosphorylation of mTOR. These findings highlight the therapeutic efficacy of Omav in AD and that its neuroprotective effects were associated with inhibiting neuronal apoptosis and regulating neuroinflammation.
