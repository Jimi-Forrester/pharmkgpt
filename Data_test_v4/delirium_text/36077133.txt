36077133|t|The Severity of COVID-19 Affects the Plasma Soluble Levels of the Immune Checkpoint HLA-G Molecule.
36077133|a|The non-classical histocompatibility antigen G (HLA-G) is an immune checkpoint molecule that has been implicated in viral disorders. We evaluated the plasma soluble HLA-G (sHLA-G) in 239 individuals, arranged in COVID-19 patients (n = 189) followed up at home or in a hospital, and in healthy controls (n = 50). Increased levels of sHLA-G were observed in COVID-19 patients irrespective of the facility care, gender, age, and the presence of comorbidities. Compared with controls, the sHLA-G levels increased as far as disease severity progressed; however, the levels decreased in critically ill patients, suggesting an immune exhaustion phenomenon. Notably, sHLA-G exhibited a positive correlation with other mediators currently observed in the acute phase of the disease, including IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10. Although sHLA-G levels may be associated with an acute biomarker of COVID-19, the increased levels alone were not associated with disease severity or mortality due to COVID-19. Whether the SARS-CoV-2 per se or the innate/adaptive immune response against the virus is responsible for the increased levels of sHLA-G are questions that need to be further addressed.
