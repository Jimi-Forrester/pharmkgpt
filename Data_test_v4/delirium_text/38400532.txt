38400532|a|INTRODUCTION: Increasing evidence suggests that amyloid reduction could serve as a plausible surrogate endpoint for clinical and cognitive efficacy. The double-blind phase 3 DIAN-TU-001 trial tested clinical and cognitive declines with increasing doses of solanezumab or gantenerumab. METHODS: We used latent class (LC) analysis on data from the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network Trials Unit 001 trial to test amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) reduction as a potential surrogate biomarker. RESULTS: LC analysis categorized participants into three classes: amyloid no change, amyloid reduction, and amyloid growth, based on longitudinal amyloid Pittsburgh compound B PET standardized uptake value ratio data. The amyloid-no-change class was at an earlier disease stage for amyloid amounts and dementia. Despite similar baseline characteristics, the amyloid-reduction class exhibited reductions in the annual decline rates compared to the amyloid-growth class across multiple biomarker, clinical, and cognitive outcomes. DISCUSSION: LC analysis indicates that amyloid reduction is associated with improved clinical outcomes and supports its use as a surrogate biomarker in clinical trials. HIGHLIGHTS: We used latent class (LC) analysis to test amyloid reduction as a surrogate biomarker. Despite similar baseline characteristics, the amyloid-reduction class exhibited remarkably better outcomes compared to the amyloid-growth class across multiple measures. LC analysis proves valuable in testing amyloid reduction as a surrogate biomarker in clinical trials lacking significant treatment effects.
