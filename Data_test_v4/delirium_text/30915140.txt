30915140|t|Baihui Point Laser Acupuncture Ameliorates Cognitive Impairment, Motor Deficit, and Neuronal Loss Partly via Antioxidant and Anti-Inflammatory Effects in an Animal Model of Focal Ischemic Stroke.
30915140|a|Stroke is recognized as one of the most dangerous killer diseases in Thailand and other countries worldwide. The development of a novel strategy for treating stroke patients is therefore urgently required. The present study investigated the effect of laser acupuncture at the Baihui point on cognitive and functional recovery, neuronal loss, antioxidant enzyme activities, and interleukin-6 (IL-6) activity in the hippocampus in an animal model of focal ischemic stroke. Male Wistar rats were randomly divided into 4 groups: sham operation; permanent occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery (Rt.MCAO); Rt.MCAO with sham laser acupuncture; and Rt.MCAO with Baihui point laser acupuncture. Laser acupuncture at the Baihui point and sham acupuncture at a nonacupoint were performed once daily (10 min at each point) for 14 days after Rt.MCAO. Half of the rats in each group were examined to determine neuron density by Cresyl violet staining, while the other half were examined by biochemical assays to measure glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) in the hippocampus, superoxide dismutase (SOD) in mitochondria and interleukin-6 (IL-6) activity in the hippocampus. Laser acupuncture treatment was found to significantly enhance memory and neuron density in CA1 and CA3. Improved neurological score, improved GSH-Px and SOD activities, and decreased density ratio of IL-6 to beta-actin were also observed in the hippocampus. In conclusion, Baihui point laser acupuncture alleviates cognitive impairment and motor deficits via antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects in focal ischemic rats. Further study is warranted to investigate other possible mechanisms of action.
