25118284|t|Amyloid-beta peptide-specific DARPins as a novel class of potential therapeutics for Alzheimer disease.
25118284|a|Passive immunization with anti-amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) antibodies is effective in animal models of Alzheimer disease. With the advent of efficient in vitro selection technologies, the novel class of designed ankyrin repeat proteins (DARPins) presents an attractive alternative to the immunoglobulin scaffold. DARPins are small and highly stable proteins with a compact modular architecture ideal for high affinity protein-protein interactions. In this report, we describe the selection, binding profile, and epitope analysis of Abeta-specific DARPins. We further showed their ability to delay Abeta aggregation and prevent Abeta-mediated neurotoxicity in vitro. To demonstrate their therapeutic potential in vivo, mono- and trivalent Abeta-specific DARPins (D23 and 3xD23) were infused intracerebroventricularly into the brains of 11-month-old Tg2576 mice over 4 weeks. Both D23 and 3xD23 treatments were shown to result in improved cognitive performance and reduced soluble Abeta levels. These findings demonstrate the therapeutic potential of Abeta-specific DARPins for the treatment of Alzheimer disease.
