37185721|t|Rheumatoid Arthritis and Reactive Oxygen Species: A Review.
37185721|a|Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, systemic inflammatory disease that causes progressive joint damage and can lead to lifelong disability. Numerous studies support the hypothesis that reactive oxygen species (ROS) are associated with RA pathogenesis. Recent advances have clarified the anti-inflammatory effect of antioxidants and their roles in RA alleviation. In addition, several important signaling pathway components, such as nuclear factor kappa B, activator-protein-1, nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2/kelch-like associated protein, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, and mitogen-activated protein kinases, including c-Jun N-terminal kinase, have been identified to be associated with RA. In this paper, we outline the ROS generation process and relevant oxidative markers, thereby providing evidence of the association between oxidative stress and RA pathogenesis. Furthermore, we describe various therapeutic targets in several prominent signaling pathways for improving RA disease activity and its hyper oxidative state. Finally, we reviewed natural foods, phytochemicals, chemical compounds with antioxidant properties and the association of microbiota with RA pathogenesis.
