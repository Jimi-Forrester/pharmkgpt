16607255|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive, degenerative, debilitating illness that affects all races and both sexes. In 2002 the numbers of women over the age of 90 years with AD were higher compared with men of the same age group (Office for National Statistics (ONS), 2004). Although there are no data identifying the number of women suffering from AD compared with men, it could be concluded from these data (ONS, 2004) that more women than men suffer from AD. The number of individuals suffering from AD is increasing as people are living longer. Analysis of postmortem brain tissue in patients with AD has identified senile plaques in the hippocampal region, neurofibrillary tangles in the brain cells and also a decline in levels of acetylcholine in the brain. There is no known cure for the illness and therefore patients will ultimately require constant care in the community or in special units in residential homes. The National Service Framework for Long-Term Conditions (Department of Health, 2005) gives clear guidelines for healthcare providers in caring for these patients.
