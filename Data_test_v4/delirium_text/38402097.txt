38402097|t|Mitochondria in disease: changes in shapes and dynamics.
38402097|a|Mitochondrial structure often determines the function of these highly dynamic, multifunctional, eukaryotic organelles, which are essential for maintaining cellular health. The dynamic nature of mitochondria is apparent in descriptions of different mitochondrial shapes [e.g., donuts, megamitochondria (MGs), and nanotunnels] and crista dynamics. This review explores the significance of dynamic alterations in mitochondrial morphology and regulators of mitochondrial and cristae shape. We focus on studies across tissue types and also describe new microscopy techniques for detecting mitochondrial morphologies both in vivo and in vitro that can improve understanding of mitochondrial structure. We highlight the potential therapeutic benefits of regulating mitochondrial morphology and discuss prospective avenues to restore mitochondrial bioenergetics to manage diseases related to mitochondrial dysfunction.
