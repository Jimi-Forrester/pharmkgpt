26835536|t|C-Terminal Fragment, Abeta32-37, Analogues Protect Against Abeta Aggregation-Induced Toxicity.
26835536|a|Amyloid-beta aggregation is a major etiological phenomenon in Alzheimer's disease. Herein, we report peptide-based inhibitors that diminish the amyloid load by obviating Abeta aggregation. Taking the hexapeptide fragment, Abeta32-37, as lead, more than 40 new peptides were synthesized. Upon evaluation of the newly synthesized hexapeptides as inhibitors of Abeta toxicity by the MTT-based cell viability assay, a number of peptides exhibited significant Abeta aggregation inhibitory activity at sub-micromolar concentration range. A hexapeptide (1) showed complete mitigation of Abeta toxicity in the cell culture assay at 2 muM. In the ThT fluorescence assay, upon incubation of Abeta with this peptide, we observed no increase in the ThT fluorescence relative to control. The secondary structure estimation by circular dichroism spectroscopy and morphological examination by transmission electron microscopy further confirmed the results.
