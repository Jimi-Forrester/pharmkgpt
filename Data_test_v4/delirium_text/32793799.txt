We used untargeted metabolomics on the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to uncover metabolomic derangements. METHODS: CSF from 92 normal controls and 93 MCI underwent untargeted metabolomics using high-resolution mass spectrometry with liquid chromatography. Partial least squares discriminant analysis was used followed by metabolite annotation and pathway enrichment analysis (PES). Significant features were correlated with disease phenotypes. RESULTS: We identified 294 features differentially expressed between the two groups and 94 were annotated. PES showed that sugar regulation (N-glycan, P = .0007; sialic acid, P = .0014; aminosugars, P = .0042; galactose, P = .0054), methionine regulation (P = .0081), and tyrosine metabolism (P = .019) pathways were differentially activated and significant features within these pathways correlated with multiple disease phenotypes. CONCLUSION: There is a metabolic signature characterized by impairments in sugars, methionine, and tyrosine regulation in MCI. Targeting these pathways may offer new therapeutic approaches to AD.
