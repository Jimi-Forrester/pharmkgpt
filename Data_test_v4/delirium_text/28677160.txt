28677160|a|AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To explore the incidence of delirium in cerebrovascular patients admitted in our Neurosurgery Intensive Care Unit and analyse the risk factors leading to delirium. BACKGROUND: Delirium is one of the most common mental disorders in general hospitals, but the incidence of different kinds of diseases and studies varies. Cerebrovascular patients in our Neurosurgery Intensive Care Unit are high-risk groups for delirium; identifying risk factors for delirium and taking early interventions are crucial for patient prognosis. DESIGN: A prospective study. METHODS: A convenience sampling method was used to collect data from 128 patients in the Neurosurgery Intensive Care Unit of Xuanwu Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China, between May 2016-January 2017. Researchers used Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (Chinese version) to assess each patient's delirium statement twice a day at regular times. We also collected other independent data variables and followed up the short-term clinical outcomes daily. RESULTS: On the basis of Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit evaluation, patients were divided into a delirium group and a nondelirium group. The prevalence of delirium among the 128 patients was 42.2%. Multivariate analysis showed that severity of illness, fever, the use of physical restraints and sleep deprivation were independent predictors of delirium in cerebrovascular patients in the Neurosurgery Intensive Care Unit. CONCLUSIONS: Cerebrovascular patients in the Neurosurgery Intensive Care Unit with a critical condition, fever or use of physical restraints or experiencing sleep deprivation were more prone to delirium. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Cerebrovascular patients in the Neurosurgery Intensive Care Unit showed a high incidence of delirium. There are many risk factors leading to delirium, some of which are independent predictors of intensive care delirium. Patients with delirium will suffer various adverse effects upon their short-term clinical outcomes. Therefore, nurses should pay close attention to changes in a patient's mental state and learn about the risk factors associated with delirium, in order to be able to take early measures to prevent delirium.
