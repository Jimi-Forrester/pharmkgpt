39729628|t|Iatrogenic cerebral amyloid angiopathy and Alzheimer's disease co-pathology.
39729628|a|Iatrogenic cerebral amyloid angiopathy, a disease caused by contact with neurosurgical material or human growth hormone contaminated by beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta), has a prion-like transmission mechanism. We present a series of three patients under 55 years of age who underwent cranial surgery. All of them developed multiple cerebral hemorrhages, transient focal neurological deficits, and/or cognitive impairment after 3-4 decades. MRI was compatible with CAA, and Abeta deposition was confirmed. The third patient, who had a ventriculoperitoneal valve, also showed Abeta deposition in the peritoneum and diagnostic biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease. Co-pathology with Alzheimer disease and its iatrogenic transmission should be considered.
