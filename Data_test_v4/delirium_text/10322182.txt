10322182|a|Recent findings have further characterized the neural and psychological bases of long-term memory failure in Alzheimer's disease. Convergent volumetric neuroimaging studies indicate that loss of episodic memory is specifically related to early-stage limbic-diencephalic pathology, and that non-mnemonic impairment is specifically related to later-stage temporal-neocortical pathology. Recent studies of Alzheimer's disease have also reported informative cognitive dissociations in semantic memory and implicit memory.
