37946876|a|Poor sleep can undermine health and may be especially disruptive to those with chronic conditions including HIV infection. Here, clinically well-described people living with HIV [PLWH] (74 men, 35 women) and healthy control (38 men, 35 women) participants were administered the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), a validated measure of subjective sleep with a global score >=5 able to distinguish good from poor sleepers. In addition, participants completed a battery of neuropsychological tests. PLWH (6.8 +- 3.7) had higher global PSQI scores than healthy controls (4.1 +- 2.8): 39.7 % of uninfected controls and 68.8 % of PLWH had a PSQI>=5 indicative of poor sleep. There were no relations between the global PSQI score and any evaluated variables among uninfected individuals or with demographic or HIV-related variables in PLWH. Instead, a higher global PSQI score among PLWH was associated with worse "Quality of Life" scores [Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF, p=0.0007), Medical Outcomes Study survey (21-item short form, SF-21, p<0.0001), and Activities of Daily Living-Instrumental (ADL-I, p=0.0041)] and higher Beck Depression Index (BDI, p<0.0001) depressive symptoms. Further, in PLWH, higher global PSQI scores were associated with poor performance on a working memory task, the digit backward span (p=0.0036). In PLWH, the 5 variables together explained 32.3 % of the global PSQI score variance; only 3 variables - the SF-21, BDI, and digit backward scores - explained 30.6 % of the variance. To the extent that poor subjective sleep contributes to impaired working memory in HIV, we speculate that this impairment may be ameliorated by improved sleep health.
