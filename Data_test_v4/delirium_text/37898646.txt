37898646|t|Clinico-radiologic subtypes and therapeutic observation of acute Marchiafava-Bignami disease.
37898646|a|We aimed to investigate the clinico-radiologic features of acute Marchiafava-Bignami disease (MBD) and its evolutionary process after effective treatment through subgroup comparison. The clinical and MRI data of 23 patients with acute MBD were retrospectively analyzed and divided into type A (12 cases, with entire callosal involvement) and type B (11 cases, with focal callosal involvement). The clinical assessments and MRI findings (before and after treatment) were compared between the two subtypes. Compared with type B, type A had lower MoCA (Montreal Cognitive Assessment) scores at admission (16.50 +- 1.73 vs 18.27 +- 1.68, P = 0.021) and were more common with extracallosal involvement (66.67% vs 18.18%, P = 0.036) and longer illness duration (18.3 +- 2.1 days vs 15.6 +- 2.4 days, P = 0.012). During the treatment, the residual lesion in the splenium was more common in type A (58.33% vs 9.09%, P = 0.027). After treatment, the MoCa scores of both subtypes gradually increased (P < 0.001), and the callosal and extracallasal lesions disappeared completely. Clinico-radiologic typing of acute MBD is related to the severity of early symptoms, but not to the prognosis. Complete clinico-radiologic recovery is possible for both subtypes with combined treatment. The clinico-radiologic reversibility is helpful for accurate diagnosis and therapeutic evaluation.
