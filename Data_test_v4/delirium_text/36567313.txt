36567313|t|Unilateral delayed post-hypoxic leukoencephalopathy: a case report.
36567313|a|BACKGROUND: Delayed post-hypoxic leukoencephalopathy is a rare entity following hypoxia. Clinical and radiological signs of delayed post-hypoxic leukoencephalopathy have not previously been reported following acute ischemic stroke. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of an 81-year-old Central European man who presented with a dissection-related occlusion of the left carotid artery. He showed clinical improvement immediately after endovascular stroke therapy, followed by a significant clinical and especially cognitive deterioration thereafter and a clinical recovery after several weeks. The clinical course of the patient was accompanied by morphological changes on magnetic resonance imaging characteristic of delayed post-hypoxic leukoencephalopathy; that is, strictly limited and localized unilaterally to the left anterior circulation. CONCLUSION: This case demonstrates that clinical symptoms and morphological changes on magnetic resonance imaging compatible with delayed post-hypoxic leukoencephalopathy do not necessarily only occur with global hypoxia, but can also occur in patients with a large vessel occlusion in the corresponding vascular territories.
