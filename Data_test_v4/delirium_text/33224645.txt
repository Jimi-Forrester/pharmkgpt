33224645|t|Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry During COVID-19 Lockdown: A Retrospective Chart Review.
33224645|a|The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused a major psychosocial impact in the community due to its direct effects and restrictive control strategies, e.g. lockdown. The current pandemic, a highly stressful situation, can predispose not only vulnerable but previously well-adjusted individuals for psychological disorders. A retrospective chart review of consultation-liaison psychiatry (CLP) case records was conducted for one month before and after the start of lockdown. Patients seen during lockdown were relatively younger; t = 1.8, p = 0.074. The most common psychiatric emergency was a suicidal attempt (34.3%) and delirium (35.4%) during and before lockdown, respectively. The probability of the emergency psychiatry presentation for attempted suicide increased significantly during lockdown (odds ratio (OR) 8.0, 95% CI 2.03 to 31.57, p = 0.003). The most common stressors for CLP patients with suicide attempts during lockdown were relationship issues and loss of privacy. It seems that stressors arising due to the current crisis are not only highly severe and multiple but qualitatively different. Further studies with larger sample sizes and from other parts of the country can further improve our understating of the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the affected community. Needless to say, higher vigilance in the community for at-risk individuals, availability, and awareness about telemedicine services can play an important role to combat the risk of suicide during the lockdown.
