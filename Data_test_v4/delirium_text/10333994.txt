10333994|a|Patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus, type 1, may present with neuropsychiatric manifestations across all stages of disease. Frequently, these patients may present with more than one neuropsychiatric disorder concomitantly. The case presented highlights the utility of detailed clinical observation, careful use of medical terminology, and a neuropsychiatric organizing paradigm in the diagnosis and treatment of a patient presenting over time with delirium, aphasia, mania, and a complex partial seizure disorder.
