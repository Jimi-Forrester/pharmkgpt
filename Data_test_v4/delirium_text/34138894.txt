METHODS: GBM patients (n = 87, single-centre, recruited 2013-2019) were retrospectively divided into low and high groups using literature-derived cut-offs (NLR = 5.07, PNI = 46.97). Kaplan-Meier survival curves and log rank tests assessed PFS and OS. Univariate and multivariate analyses identified PFS and OS prognosticators. RESULTS: High vs low post-operative PNI cohort was associated with longer PFS (279 vs 136 days, p = 0.009), but significance was lost on multivariate analysis. Post-operative ECOG (p = 0.043), daily dexamethasone (p = 0.023) and IDH mutation (p = 0.046) were significant on multivariate analysis for PFS. High pre- and post-operative PNI were associated with improved OS (384 vs 114 days, p = 0.034 and 516 vs 245 days, p = 0.001, respectively). Low postoperative NLR correlated with OS (408 vs 249 days, p = 0.029). On multivariate analysis using forward selection process, extent of resection (EOR) (GTR vs biopsy, p = 0.004 and STR vs biopsy, p = 0.011), and any previous surgery (p = 0.014) were independent prognostic biomarkers for OS. On multivariate analysis of these latter variables with literature-derived prognostic biomarkers, EOR remained significantly associated with OS (p = 0.037). CONCLUSIONS: EOR, followed by having any surgery prior to GBM, are the most significant independent predictors of GBM patient's OS. Post-operative ECOG, daily dexamethasone and IDH mutation are independent prognostic biomarkers for PFS. PNI may be superior to NLR. Post- vs pre-operative serum inflammatory marker levels may be associated with survival.
