30564004|t|Delirium Tremens: Assessment and Management.
30564004|a|Delirium Tremens (DT) falls in the most severe spectrum of alcohol withdrawal, which could potentially result in death, unless managed promptly and adequately. The prevalence of DT in general population is <1% and nearly 2% in patients with alcohol dependence. DT presents with a combination of severe alcohol withdrawal symptoms and symptoms of delirium with agitation and sometimes hallucination. Clinical and laboratory parameters which predict DT have been discussed. Assessment of DT includes assessment of severity of alcohol withdrawal, evaluation of delirium, and screening for underlying medical co-morbidities. Liver disease as a co-morbidity is very common in patients with DT and that could complicate the clinical presentation, determine the treatment choice, and influence the outcome. Benzodiazepines are the mainstay of treatment for DT. Diazepam and lorazepam are preferred benzodiazepine, depending upon the treatment regime and clinical context. In benzodiazepine refractory cases, Phenobarbital, propofol, and dexmedetomidine could be used.
