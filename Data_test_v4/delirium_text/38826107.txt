38826107|t|Nanodisc Reconstitution and Characterization of Amyloid-beta Precursor Protein C99.
38826107|a|Amyloid precursor protein (APP) plays a pivotal role in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Since the fragmentation of the membrane-bound APP that results in the production of amyloid-beta peptides is the starting point for amyloid toxicity in AD, it is important to investigate the structure and dynamics of APP in a near-native lipid-bilayer environment. However, the reconstitution of APP into a stable and suitable membrane-mimicking lipid environment is a challenging task. In this study, the 99-residue C-terminal domain of APP is successfully reconstituted into polymer nanodiscs and characterized using size-exclusion chromatography, mass spectrometry, solution NMR, and magic-angle spinning solid-state NMR. In addition, the feasibility of using lipid-solubilizing polymers for isolating and characterizing APP in the native Escherichia. coli membrane environment is demonstrated.
