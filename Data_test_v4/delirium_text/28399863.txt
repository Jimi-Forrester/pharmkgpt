28399863|t|Vectorized nanodelivery systems for ischemic stroke: a concept and a need.
28399863|a|Neurological diseases of diverse aetiologies have significant effects on the quality of life of patients. The limited self-repairing capacity of the brain is considered to be the origin of the irreversible and progressive nature of many neurological diseases. Therefore, neuroprotection is an important goal shared by many clinical neurologists and neuroscientists. In this review, we discuss the main obstacles that have prevented the implementation of experimental neuroprotective strategies in humans and propose alternative avenues for the use of neuroprotection as a feasible therapeutic approach. Special attention is devoted to nanotechnology, which is a new approach for developing highly specific and localized biomedical solutions for the study of the multiple mechanisms involved in stroke. Nanotechnology is contributing to personalized neuroprotection by allowing us to identify mechanisms, determine optimal therapeutic windows, and protect patients from brain damage. In summary, multiple aspects of these new players in biomedicine should be considered in future in vivo and in vitro studies with the aim of improving their applicability to clinical studies.
