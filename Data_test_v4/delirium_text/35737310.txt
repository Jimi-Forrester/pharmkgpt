35737310|t|Phylogenetic and Mutation Analysis of the Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis Virus Sequence Isolated in Costa Rica from a Mare with Encephalitis.
35737310|a|Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis virus (VEEV) is an arboviral pathogen in tropical America that causes lethal encephalitis in horses and humans. VEEV is classified into six subtypes (I to VI). Subtype I viruses are divided into epizootic (IAB and IC) and endemic strains (ID and IE) that can produce outbreaks or sporadic diseases, respectively. The objective of this study was to reconstruct the phylogeny and the molecular clock of sequences of VEEV subtype I complex and identify mutations within sequences belonging to epizootic or enzootic subtypes focusing on a sequence isolated from a mare in Costa Rica. Bayesian phylogeny of the VEEV subtype I complex tree with 110 VEEV complete genomes was analyzed. Evidence of positive selection was evaluated with Datamonkey server algorithms. The putative effects of mutations on the 3D protein structure in the Costa Rica sequence were evaluated. The phylogenetic analysis showed that Subtype IE-VEEV diverged earlier than other subtypes, Costa Rican VEEV-IE ancestors came from Nicaragua in 1963 and Guatemala in 1907. Among the observed non-synonymous mutations, only 17 amino acids changed lateral chain groups. Fourteen mutations located in the NSP3, E1, and E2 genes are unique in this sequence, highlighting the importance of E1-E2 genes in VEEV evolution.
