34350562|a|INTRODUCTION: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is associated with the onset of several major liver diseases. Inactive hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) carriers (IHCs) may be successfully treated with PEGylated interferon-alpha2b (PEG-IFNalpha2b)-based antiviral therapy; however, studies on this treatment have been insufficient. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of PEG-IFNalpha2b treatment in IHCs. METHODS: Nineteen IHCs were treated with subcutaneous PEG-IFNalpha2b (180 mug/week) for 48 weeks (treatment group). Patients were followed up for 24 weeks after treatment discontinuation. Twenty untreated control patients were observed for 72 weeks (control group). HBsAg clearance (HBsAg < 0.05 IU/mL), HBsAg seroconversion, and alanine aminotransferase levels were monitored. RESULTS: Of the 19 patients treated with PEG-IFNalpha2b, 16 showed HBsAg loss (84.2%), and 13 showed HBsAg seroconversion (68.4%) at 72 weeks. All patients in the treatment group exhibited virological response (serum HBV DNA level < 10 IU/mL) at the time of drug withdrawal. In the control group, no patients experienced HBsAg loss during the observational period. There were no serious adverse events during treatment, and the therapy was well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: Short PEG-IFNalpha2b therapy in IHCs produced a high functional cure rate and good safety profile, suggesting that PEG-IFNalpha2b treatment may be the best choice for clinical cure of some IHCs.
