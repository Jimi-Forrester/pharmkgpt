36430254|a|Depression is a globally widespread disorder caused by a complicated interplay of social, psychological, and biological factors. Approximately 280 million people are suffering from depression worldwide. Traditional frontline antidepressants targeting monoamine neurotransmitters show unsatisfactory effects.
