38438491|a|We sought to identify alterations in the quantity of plasma brain-derived extracellular vesicles (EV) over the first month post-stroke to shed light on related injury and repair mechanisms. We assessed plasma levels of presumed neuron-derived EVs (NDEs), astrocyte-derived EVs (ADEs), and oligodendrocyte-derived EVs (ODEs) in 58 patients 5, 15, and 30 days post-ischemic stroke and 46 controls matched for cardiovascular risk factors using sandwich immunoassays. Subsets of brain-derived EVs were identified by co-expression of the general EV marker CD9 and markers for neurons (L1CAM, CD171), astrocytes (EAAT1), and oligodendrocytes (MOG) respectively. Clinical MRIs assessed lesion volume and presence of hemorrhagic transformation. ADE levels were elevated 5, 15, and 30 days post-stroke compared to controls (p = 0.002, p = 0.002, and p = 0.005 respectively) with no significant change for NDE or ODE. ADEs were increased 15 days post-stroke in patients with hemorrhagic transformation (p = 0.04) compared to patients with no hemorrhage. We conclude that ADE levels are preferentially increased over the first month post-stroke in humans, possibly to provide trophic support to injured neurons following ischemia. ADEs hold potential as biomarkers of blood-brain barrier breakdown and hemorrhagic transformation, but this requires further study at earlier time points post-stroke.
