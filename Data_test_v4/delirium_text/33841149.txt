33841149|t|Head-to-Head Comparison of Sedation and Somnolence Among 37 Antipsychotics in Schizophrenia, Bipolar Disorder, Major Depression, Autism Spectrum Disorders, Delirium, and Repurposed in COVID-19, Infectious Diseases, and Oncology From the FAERS, 2004-2020.
33841149|a|Objective: Antipsychotic compounds are known to induce sedation somnolence and have expanded clinical indications beyond schizophrenia to regulatory approval in bipolar disorder, treatment-resistant depression, and is being repurposed in infectious diseases and oncology. However, the medical sciences literature lacks a comprehensive association between sedation and somnolence among a wide-range of antipsychotic compounds. The objective of this study is to assess the disproportionality of sedation and somnolence among thirty-seven typical and atypical antipsychotics. Materials and Methods: Patient adverse drug reactions (ADR) cases were obtained from the United States Food and Drug Administration Adverse Events Reporting System (FAERS) between January 01, 2004 and September 30, 2020 for a wide-array of clinical indications and off-label use of antipsychotics. An assessment of disproportionality were based on cases of sedation and somnolence and calculated using the case/non-case methodology. Statistical analysis resulting in the reporting odds-ratio (ROR) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were conducted using the R statistical programming language. Results: Throughout the reporting period, there were a total of 9,373,236 cases with 99,251 specific ADRs reporting sedation and somnolence. Zuclopenthixol (n = 224) ROR = 13.3 (95% CI, 11.6-15.3) was most strongly associated of sedation and somnolence and haloperidol decanoate long-acting injection (LAI) was not statistically associated sedation and somnolence. Further, among atypical antipsychotic compounds, tiapride and asenapine were the top two compounds most strongly associated with sedation and somnolence. Comprehensively, the typical antipsychotics ROR = 5.05 (95%CI, 4.97-5.12) had a stronger association with sedation and somnolence when compared to atypical antipsychotics ROR = 4.65 (95%CI, 4.47-4.84). Conclusion: We conducted a head-to-head comparison of thirty-seven antipsychotics and ranked the compounds based on the association of sedation and somnolence from ADR data collected throughout 16 years from the FAERS. The results are informative and with recent interests in repurposing phenothiazine antipsychotics in infectious disease and oncology provides an informative assessment of the compounds during repurposing and in psychopharmacology.
