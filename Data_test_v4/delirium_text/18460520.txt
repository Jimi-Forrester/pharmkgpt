18460520|t|Iatrogenic delirium and coma: a "near miss".
18460520|a|A 66-year-old woman was cared for at two referral institutions following a witnessed cardiac arrest in a local emergency department. Despite aggressive initial care, she failed to regain consciousness during a 28-day course. Based on an erroneous neurologic diagnosis of anoxic encephalopathy, pessimism regarding likelihood of improvement existed, prompting clinical consideration of withdrawal of care. The correct diagnosis of iatrogenic drug-induced coma alternating with drug-induced delirium only became apparent after the IV administration of repeated doses of a benzodiazepine antagonist. The patient and husband (co-authors) provide insights often unheard within care circles.
