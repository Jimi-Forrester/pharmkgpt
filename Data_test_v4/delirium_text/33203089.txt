33203089|a|The nonenzymatic adduction of malondialdehyde (MDA) to the protein amino groups leads to the formation of malondialdehyde-lysine (MDALys). The degree of unsaturation of biological membranes and the intracellular oxidative conditions are the main factors that modulate MDALys formation. The low concentration of this modification in the different cellular components, found in a wide diversity of tissues and animal species, is indicative of the presence of a complex network of cellular protection mechanisms that avoid its cytotoxic effects. In this review, we will focus on the chemistry of this lipoxidation-derived protein modification, the specificity of MDALys formation in proteins, the methodology used for its detection and quantification, the MDA-lipoxidized proteome, the metabolism of MDA-modified proteins, and the detrimental effects of this protein modification. We also propose that MDALys is an indicator of the rate of aging based on findings which demonstrate that (i) MDALys accumulates in tissues with age, (ii) the lower the concentration of MDALys the greater the longevity of the animal species, and (iii) its concentration is attenuated by anti-aging nutritional and pharmacological interventions.
