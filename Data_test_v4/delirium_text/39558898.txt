39558898|a|BACKGROUND: Associations between longitudinal changes of plasma biomarkers and cerebral magnetic resonance (MR)-derived measurements in Alzheimer's disease (AD) remain unclear. METHODS: In a study population (n = 127) of healthy older adults and patients within the AD continuum, we examined associations between longitudinal plasma amyloid beta 42/40 ratio, tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 (p-tau181), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), neurofilament light chain (NfL), and 7T structural and functional MR imaging and spectroscopy using linear mixed models. RESULTS: Increases in both p-tau181 and GFAP showed the strongest associations to 7T MR-derived measurements, particularly with decreasing parietal cortical thickness, decreasing connectivity of the salience network, and increasing neuroinflammation as determined by MR spectroscopy (MRS) myo-inositol. DISCUSSION: Both plasma p-tau181 and GFAP appear to reflect disease progression, as indicated by 7T MR-derived brain changes which are not limited to areas known to be affected by tau pathology and neuroinflammation measured by MRS myo-inositol, respectively. HIGHLIGHTS: This study leverages high-resolution 7T magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and MR spectroscopy (MRS) for Alzheimer's disease (AD) plasma biomarker insights. Tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 (p-tau181) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) showed the largest changes over time, particularly in the AD group. p-tau181 and GFAP are robust in reflecting 7T MR-based changes in AD. The strongest associations were for frontal/parietal MR changes and MRS neuroinflammation.
