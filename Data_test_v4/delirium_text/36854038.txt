36854038|t|HR LC-MS/MS metabolomic profiling of Yucca aloifolia fruit and the potential neuroprotective effect on rotenone-induced Parkinson's disease in rats.
36854038|a|Yucca aloifolia L. fruit (Yucca or Spanish bayonet, family Asparagaceae) is recognized for its purplish red color reflecting its anthocyanin content, which has a powerful antioxidant activity. This study aimed to investigate yucca (YA) fruit extract's protective effect on Parkinson's disease (PD). In vitro study, the anti-inflammatory activity of yucca fruit extracts was explored by measuring tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 (TNF-R2) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-KB) to choose the most effective extract. Afterward, a detailed in vivo investigation of the protective effect of the most active extract on rotenone-induced PD was performed on male albino Wister rats. First, the safety of the extract in two different doses (50 and 100 mg/kg in 0.9% saline orally) was confirmed by a toxicological study. The rats were divided into four groups: 1) normal control (NC); 2) rotenone group; and third and fourth groups received 50 and 100 mg/kg yucca extract, respectively. The neurobehavioral and locomotor activities of the rats were tested by rotarod, open field, and forced swim tests. Striatal dopamine, renal and liver functions, and oxidative stress markers were assessed. Western blot analysis of brain tissue samples was performed for p-AMPK, Wnt3a, and beta-catenin. Histopathological examination of striatal tissue samples was performed by light and electron microscopy (EM). The metabolites of the active extract were characterized using high-resolution LC-MS/MS, and the results showed the prevalence of anthocyanins, saponins, phenolics, and choline. Biochemical and histopathological tests revealed a dose-dependent improvement with oral Yucca extract. The current study suggests a possible neuroprotective effect of the acidified 50% ethanol extract (YA-C) of the edible Yucca fruit, making it a promising therapeutic target for PD.
