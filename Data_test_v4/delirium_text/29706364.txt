29706364|a|BACKGROUND: Older people are increasing users of health care globally. We aimed to establish whether older people with characteristics of frailty and who are at risk of adverse health-care outcomes could be identified using routinely collected data. METHODS: A three-step approach was used to develop and validate a Hospital Frailty Risk Score from International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) diagnostic codes. First, we carried out a cluster analysis to identify a group of older people (>=75 years) admitted to hospital who had high resource use and diagnoses associated with frailty. Second, we created a Hospital Frailty Risk Score based on ICD-10 codes that characterised this group. Third, in separate cohorts, we tested how well the score predicted adverse outcomes and whether it identified similar groups as other frailty tools. FINDINGS: In the development cohort (n=22 139), older people with frailty diagnoses formed a distinct group and had higher non-elective hospital use (33 6 bed-days over 2 years compared with 23 0 bed-days for the group with the next highest number of bed-days). In the national validation cohort (n=1 013 590), compared with the 429 762 (42 4%) patients with the lowest risk scores, the 202 718 (20 0%) patients with the highest Hospital Frailty Risk Scores had increased odds of 30-day mortality (odds ratio 1 71, 95% CI 1 68-1 75), long hospital stay (6 03, 5 92-6 10), and 30-day readmission (1 48, 1 46-1 50). The c statistics (ie, model discrimination) between individuals for these three outcomes were 0 60, 0 68, and 0 56, respectively. The Hospital Frailty Risk Score showed fair overlap with dichotomised Fried and Rockwood scales (kappa scores 0 22, 95% CI 0 15-0 30 and 0 30, 0 22-0 38, respectively) and moderate agreement with the Rockwood Frailty Index (Pearson's correlation coefficient 0 41, 95% CI 0 38-0 47). INTERPRETATION: The Hospital Frailty Risk Score provides hospitals and health systems with a low-cost, systematic way to screen for frailty and identify a group of patients who are at greater risk of adverse outcomes and for whom a frailty-attuned approach might be useful.
