33967049|t|A Novel Cognitive Function Scale Using Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy for Evaluating Cognitive Dysfunction.
33967049|a|BACKGROUND: Maintaining cognitive function is integral to a healthy social life in the aged. Although neuropsychological tests and brain imaging methods can assess cognitive dysfunction, these techniques are subjective, psychologically burdensome, and cannot be conducted easily. OBJECTIVE: We sought to develop an objective, low-burden novel cognitive function scale based on functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) of hemodynamic changes in the cerebral cortex during daily task performance. METHODS: A total of 63 participants (aged 60-80 years) identified as non-dementia controls (NDC) or with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) were recruited and randomly assigned to training and test data sets. Explanatory variables were hemodynamic responses during low-burden sensory and simple tasks without higher-order brain functioning. RESULTS: A logistic regression analysis of the fNIRS index in NDCs and MCI patients revealed area under the curve, sensitivity, specificity, and holdout results of 0.98, 94%, 88%, and 62% respectively. Correlation between fNIRS index and MCI odds showed positive linearity (R2 = 0.96). CONCLUSION: Positive correlation between the fNIRS index and MCI odds indicated effectiveness of this fNIRS measurement. Although additional experiments are necessary, the fNIRS index representing degree of cognitive decline can be an onsite monitoring tool to assess cognitive status.
