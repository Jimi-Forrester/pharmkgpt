32622942|a|Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) is an endogenous lipid mediator that, also by blunting astrocyte activation, demonstrated beneficial properties in several in vitro and in vivo models of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the present study, we used astrocyte-neuron co-cultures from 3xTg-AD mouse (i.e. an animal model of AD) cerebral cortex to further investigate on the role of astrocytes in PEA-induced neuroprotection. To this aim, we evaluated the number of viable cells, apoptotic nuclei, microtubule-associated protein-2 (MAP2) positive cells and morphological parameters in cortical neurons co-cultured with cortical astrocytes pre-exposed, or not, to Abeta42 (0.5 muM; 24 h) or PEA (0.1 muM; 24 h). Pre-exposure of astrocytes to Abeta42 failed to affect the viability, the number of neuronal apoptotic nuclei, MAP2 positive cell number, neuritic aggregations/100 mum, dendritic branches per neuron, the neuron body area, the length of the longest dendrite and number of neurites/neuron in 3xTg-AD mouse astrocyte-neuron co-cultures. Compared to neurons from wild-type (non-Tg) mouse co-cultures, 3xTg-AD mouse neurons co-cultured with astrocytes from this mutant mice displayed higher number of apoptotic nuclei, lower MAP2 immunoreactivity and several morphological changes. These signs of neuronal suffering were significantly counteracted when the 3xTg-AD mouse cortical neurons were co-cultured with 3xTg-AD mouse astrocytes pre-exposed to PEA. The present data suggest that in astrocyte-neuron co-cultures from 3xTg-AD mice, astrocytes contribute to neuronal damage and PEA, by possibly counteracting reactive astrogliosis, improved neuronal survival. These findings further support the role of PEA as a possible new therapeutic opportunity in AD treatment.
