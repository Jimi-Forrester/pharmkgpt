19893665|t|Cirrhosis presenting as Parkinsonism.
19893665|a|Cirrhosis presenting as Parkinsonism is a distinct subset of acquired chronic hepatocerebral degeneration. The entity is not rare, and unless suspected, cirrhosis can easily be overlooked. We report our experience with three such patients. They presented to us, over a period of two years, with symmetrical Parkinsonism and were later diagnosed to have cirrhosis with portal hypertension. All patients had minimal or absent tremors. Reversal of serum albumin to globulin ratio and evidence of cirrhosis on abdominal ultrasound were consistent. All three patients had the characteristic MRI abnormality of symmetrical T1 hyperintensity in basal ganglia and anterior midbrain. They improved to variable extents after treatment for cirrhosis, along with dopa agonists. We stress the importance of recognizing this syndrome and briefly review the relevant literature.
