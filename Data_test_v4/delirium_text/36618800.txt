36618800|a|Background: To use network pharmacology and gut microbiota sequencing to investigate the probable mechanism of Bining decoction (BN) in the treatment of gouty nephropathy (GN). Methods: Firstly, the mechanism of therapeutic effects of BN on GN were collected by integrating network pharmacology. Secondly, the treatment effects of BN against GN in 30 Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) mice were evaluated by performing biochemical tests [uric acid, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine (UA, BUN, and Cr)] and evaluating the renal weight index. Finally, 16S rRNA sequencing was utilized for elucidating the therapeutical effect of BN in GN. Results: The results of gut microbiota sequencing analysis showed the abundance of Faecalibaculum, Romboutsia, Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides, Odoribacter, Lachnospiraceae NK4A136 group, unclassified_f__Lachnospiraceae, Roseburia, norank_f__Lachnospiraceae, Lactobacillus, Dubosiella, norank_f__Muribaculaceae, and Turicibacter in the BN group had a significant changed between-group comparisons. Using a network pharmacology-related database, 413 active components of BN were identified, as well as 1,085 GN-associated targets. The 118 targets of disease targets and component targets were mapped, of which the top 10 genes were selected. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) results showed that 157 pathways were enriched, which was partially consistent with the metabolic pathways of gut microbiota sequencing analysis. Conclusions: Combining 16S rRNA gene sequencing and network pharmacology analysis, similar signaling pathways were followed: "Pathways in cancer" and "Adipocytokine signaling pathway". The results reveal that BN increases the abundance of Turicibacter, regulates the expression of JAK2 in the JAK/STAT pathway, increases the beneficial bacteria Turicibacter associated with intestinal butyric acid, which could enhance the intestinal barrier, and exert anti-inflammatory effects.
