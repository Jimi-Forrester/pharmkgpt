37056224|t|Dental caries and their microbiomes in children: what do we do now?
37056224|a|The oral cavity is an unique ecosystem formed by different structures, tissues, and a complex microbial community formed by hundreds of different species of bacteria, fungi, viruses, phages, and the candidate phyla radiation (CPR) group, all living in symbiosis with healthy individuals. In an opposite state, dental caries is a biofilm-mediated dysbiosis that involves changes in the core microbiome composition and function, which leads to the demineralization of tooth tissues due to the fermentation of dietary carbohydrates, producing acid by select oral bacteria. The cariogenic biofilm is typically characterized by bacterial species with the ability of adhering to the saliva-coated tooth surface, production of exopolysaccharides-rich matrix (which will limit the diffusion of acidic products of carbohydrate fermentation), and the ability of surviving in this acidic environment. Besides years of research and dental treatment, dental caries remains the most common chronic disease in children worldwide. This article aims to bring an insightful discussion about important questions that remain unanswered in the Cariology and Oral Microbiology fields, to move Science forward, characterize the interrelationships of these communities, and understand mechanistic functions between microorganisms and the host, therefore leading to translatable knowledge that benefits the provision of care to our pediatric patients.
