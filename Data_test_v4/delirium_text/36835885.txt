36835885|t|Bronchoscopic Endobronchial Valve Therapy for Persistent Air Leaks in COVID-19 Patients Requiring Veno-Venous Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation.
36835885|a|COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) can be associated with extensive lung damage, pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum and, in severe cases, persistent air leaks (PALs) via bronchopleural fistulae (BPF). PALs can impede weaning from invasive ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). We present a series of patients requiring veno-venous ECMO for COVID-19 ARDS who underwent endobronchial valve (EBV) management of PAL. This is a single-centre retrospective observational study. Data were collated from electronic health records. Patients treated with EBV met the following criteria: ECMO for COVID-19 ARDS; the presence of BPF causing PAL; air leak refractory to conventional management preventing ECMO and ventilator weaning. Between March 2020 and March 2022, 10 out of 152 patients requiring ECMO for COVID-19 developed refractory PALs, which were successfully treated with bronchoscopic EBV placement. The mean age was 38.3 years, 60% were male, and half had no prior co-morbidities. The average duration of air leaks prior to EBV deployment was 18 days. EBV placement resulted in the immediate cessation of air leaks in all patients with no peri-procedural complications. Weaning of ECMO, successful ventilator recruitment and removal of pleural drains were subsequently possible. A total of 80% of patients survived to hospital discharge and follow-up. Two patients died from multi-organ failure unrelated to EBV use. This case series presents the feasibility of EBV placement in severe parenchymal lung disease with PAL in patients requiring ECMO for COVID-19 ARDS and its potential to expedite weaning from both ECMO and mechanical ventilation, recovery from respiratory failure and ICU/hospital discharge.
