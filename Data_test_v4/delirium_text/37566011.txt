37566011|t|Pericyte Loss in Diseases.
37566011|a|Pericytes are specialized cells located in close proximity to endothelial cells within the microvasculature. They play a crucial role in regulating blood flow, stabilizing vessel walls, and maintaining the integrity of the blood-brain barrier. The loss of pericytes has been associated with the development and progression of various diseases, such as diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, sepsis, stroke, and traumatic brain injury. This review examines the detection of pericyte loss in different diseases, explores the methods employed to assess pericyte coverage, and elucidates the potential mechanisms contributing to pericyte loss in these pathological conditions. Additionally, current therapeutic strategies targeting pericytes are discussed, along with potential future interventions aimed at preserving pericyte function and promoting disease mitigation.
