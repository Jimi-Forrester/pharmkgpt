17328931|a|Decision-making in mild dementia of Alzheimer's type (DAT) was assessed in a gambling task with stable and explicit rules [Game of Dice Task; Brand, M., Labudda, K., Kalbe, E., Hilker, R., Emmans, D., Fuchs, G., et al. (2004). Decision-making impairments in patients with Parkinson's disease. Behavioural Neurology, 15, 77-85]. DAT patients in an early stage of the disease chose safe alternatives as frequently as healthy elderly persons and did not show risky behaviour as has been reported for other neurological patient groups. However, a more detailed analysis disclosed important differences between DAT and healthy elderly. Compared to healthy controls, DAT patients shifted more frequently between safe and risky alternatives and showed less consistent response patterns. Frequent changes between strategies indicate that decisions were taken randomly, that no advantageous strategy was established and that no consistent response pattern was developed over time. As regards performance changes over the task, healthy participants had a stronger tendency towards safe and advantageous responses than DAT patients. While healthy controls showed learning as the task proceeded, DAT patients did not adapt their strategies. The proportion of "consistently safe responders" was significantly higher in the control group than in the DAT group. Analysis of reaction times indicated that differences in response behaviour were not due to fast and impulsive decision taking in the DAT group. DAT patients' response pattern may be attributed to deficits in learning and in executive functions. The frequency of changes between safe and risky choices proved to be a fair predictor for the distinction between mild DAT and healthy aging.
