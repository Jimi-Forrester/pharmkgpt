38169693|t|Unveiling the therapeutic potential: Evaluation of anti-inflammatory and antineoplastic activity of Magnolia champaca Linn's stem bark isolate through molecular docking insights.
38169693|a|Magnolia champaca Linn. has traditionally been used for medicinal activity in Asia for treating various chronic diseases as well as a source of food, medicines, and other commodities. Due to the long-used history of this plant, the present study was designed to explore the in vitro, in vivo and in silico anti-inflammatory and antineoplastic properties of the methanolic extract and fractions and the pure compound isolated from the most active chloroform fraction (CHF) of the stem bark of the plant. The isolated compound from the most active CHF was characterized and identified as a glycoside, trans-syringin, through chromatographic and spectroscopic (1H-NMR and 13C-NMR) analyses. In the in vitro anti-inflammatory assay, CHF was most effective in inhibiting inflammation and hemolysis of RBCs by 73.91 +- 1.70% and 75.92 +- 0.14%, respectively, induced by heat and hypotonicity compared to standard acetylsalicylic acid. In the egg albumin denaturation assay, CME and CHF showed the highest inhibition by 56.25 +- 0.82% and 65.82 +- 3.52%, respectively, contrasted with acetylsalicylic acid by 80.14 +- 2.44%. In an in vivo anti-inflammatory assay, statistically significant (p < 0.05) decreases in the parameters of inflammation, such as paw edema, leukocyte migration and vascular permeability, were recorded in a dose-dependent manner in the treated groups. In the antineoplastic assay, 45.26 +- 2.24% and 68.31 +- 3.26% inhibition of tumor cell growth for pure compound were observed compared to 73.26 +- 3.41% for standard vincristine. Apoptotic morphologic alterations, such as membrane and nuclear condensation and fragmentation, were also found in EAC cells after treatment with the isolated bioactive pure compound. Such treatment also reversed the increased WBC count and decreased RBC count to normal values compared to the untreated EAC cell-bearing mice and the standard vincristine-treated mice. Subsequently, in silico molecular docking studies substantiated the current findings, and the isolated pure compound and standard vincristine exhibited -6.4 kcal/mol and -7.3 kcal/mol binding affinities with topoisomerase-II. Additionally, isolated pure compound and standard diclofenac showed -8.2 kcal/mol and -7.6 kcal/mol binding affinities with the COX-2 enzyme, respectively. The analysis of this research suggests that the isolated bioactive pure compound possesses moderate to potent anti-inflammatory and antineoplastic activity and justifies the traditional uses of the stem bark of M. champaca. However, further investigations are necessary to analyze its bioactivity, proper mechanism of action and clinical trials for the revelation of new drug formulations.
