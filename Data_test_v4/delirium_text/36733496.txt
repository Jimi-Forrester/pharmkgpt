36733496|t|Subjective Cognition is Related to Patient-Reported Symptom Distress and Work Productivity Among Liver Transplant Recipients.
36733496|a|Cognitive decline may prevent liver transplant (LT) recipients from staying healthy and independent. This study examined associations of objective and subjective, rated by LT recipients and caregivers, cognitive decline with patient-reported physical and psychological symptom distress, ability to perform household tasks, and workplace productivity among LT recipients. Sixty pairs of LT recipients and caregivers participated in this cross-sectional study. Subjective cognition was measured by the Everyday Cognition. Objective cognition was assessed with four cognitive tests, including the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status. Patient-reported outcomes were assessed with the Rotterdam Symptom Checklist-Modified, Profile of Mood States-Short Form, Creative Therapy Consultants Homemaking Assessment, and Work Limitations Questionnaire. Linear regression analyses related objective and subjective cognition to the patient-reported outcomes. While objective cognitive decline was not associated with any patient-reported outcomes, subjective cognitive decline was significantly associated with the outcomes. Higher LT recipient self-rated cognitive decline was associated with higher physical symptom distress ( beta  = 0.30, p = 0.006) and workplace productivity loss ( beta  = 14.85, p < 0.0001). Higher caregiver-rated cognitive decline was associated with lower household tasks performance ( beta  = -18.55, p = 0.015). Findings suggest to consider subjective cognition when developing an individualized post-transplant care plan.
