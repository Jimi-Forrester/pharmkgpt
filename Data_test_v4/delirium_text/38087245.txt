38087245|t|Efficacy and safety of remimazolam compared with propofol in hypertensive patients undergoing breast cancer surgery: a single-center, randomized, controlled study.
38087245|a|BACKGROUND: Remimazolam, as a novel anesthetic, has recently been shown to improve hemodynamic stability during anesthesia induction and maintenance; however, it has not been reported in the hypertensive population. This study aimed to compare the effects of remimazolam and propofol on hemodynamic stability in hypertensive patients undergoing breast cancer surgery. METHODS: We enrolled 120 hypertensive patients undergoing breast cancer surgery in this prospective study and randomly allocated them to remimazolam (n = 60) or propofol (n = 60) groups. Anesthesia regimens were consistent between groups, except for the administration of remimazolam and propofol. Our primary outcome was the incidence of post-induction hypotension, which was either an absolute mean arterial pressure (MAP) < 60 mmHg or a > 30% relative drop in MAP compared to baseline within 20 min of induction or from induction to the start of surgery. Secondary outcomes included minimum MAP and MAP at different time points during anesthesia, the application of vasoactive drugs, adverse events, and the patient's self-reported Quality of Recovery-40 scale for the day after surgery. RESULTS: The incidence of post-induction hypotension was lower and the minimum MAP during induction was higher in the remimazolam group than those in the propofol group. There were no significant differences between the two groups in the remaining outcomes. CONCLUSION: Remimazolam is safe and effective in hypertensive patients undergoing breast cancer surgery. Induction with remimazolam in hypertensive patients may result in more stable hemodynamics than propofol.
