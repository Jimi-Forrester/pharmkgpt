36979503|t|MicroRNA in the Diagnosis and Treatment of Doxorubicin-Induced Cardiotoxicity.
36979503|a|Doxorubicin (DOX), a broad-spectrum chemotherapy drug, is widely applied to the treatment of cancer; however, DOX-induced cardiotoxicity (DIC) limits its clinical therapeutic utility. However, it is difficult to monitor and detect DIC at an early stage using conventional detection methods. Thus, sensitive, accurate, and specific methods of diagnosis and treatment are important in clinical practice. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) belong to non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) and are stable and easy to detect. Moreover, miRNAs are expected to become biomarkers and therapeutic targets for DIC; thus, there are currently many studies focusing on the role of miRNAs in DIC. In this review, we list the prominent studies on the diagnosis and treatment of miRNAs in DIC, explore the feasibility and difficulties of using miRNAs as diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets, and provide recommendations for future research.
