36628040|t|A Case of Transverse Myelitis Secondary to COVID-19 Infection.
36628040|a|Infection with COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) is associated with a variety of generalized and specific symptoms, including neurological complications of both the peripheral and central nervous systems. In this case report, we present the case of a previously healthy 55-year-old woman who was diagnosed with transverse myelitis following a previous infection with COVID-19. MRI showed progressive demyelination of the cervical and thoracic spinal cord, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) showed increased levels of protein and red blood cells and no markers of infection, including negative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for COVID-19 antibodies. The patient was treated with a course of methylprednisolone, multiple treatments of plasmapheresis, and ongoing treatment with rituximab, all of which were well-tolerated. She was instructed to follow up as an outpatient with the neurologist and primary care physician five to seven days after hospital discharge.
