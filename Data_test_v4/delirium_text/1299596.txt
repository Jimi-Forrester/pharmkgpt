1299596|t|[Withdrawal syndrome from antidepressive drugs. Report of 5 cases].
1299596|a|Antidepressant withdrawal symptoms, following abrupt or gradual discontinuation of antidepressants, include general somatic distress (flu-like syndromes, gastro-intestinal disturbances, myalgias, headache, chills, weakness and rhinorrhea), anxiety, agitation, sleep disturbances, movement disorders, cardiac arrhythmias, delirium and manic reactions. Two cases of delirium, an hypomanic reaction and two general distress and movement disorders are reported. Cases 1 and 2 required admission to a general hospital. The etiology of the delirium was difficult to assess as long as the clinicians did not know that patients were taking antidepressants. Case 3 corresponds to the paradoxical activation following antidepressant interruption. Cases 4 and 5 constitutes light withdrawal syndromes. Most of cases are probably unrecognized. These cases reflect the importance in daily practice of the phenomena. It can be concluded from our study that: antidepressants must not be abruptly discontinued when a somatic disease appears. When a patient treated with a psychotropic drug develops delirium, the withdrawal of antidepressant must be suspected and the prescribing physician contacted to know what kind of psychoactive medication was prescribed.
