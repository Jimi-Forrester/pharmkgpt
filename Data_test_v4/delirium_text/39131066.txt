39131066|a|Neurocognitive dysfunction is common in heart failure (HF), with 30% to 80% of patients experiencing some degree of deficits in one or more cognitive domains, including memory, attention, learning ability, executive function, and psychomotor speed. Although the mechanism is not fully understood, reduced cardiac output, comorbidities, chronic cerebral hypoperfusion, and cardioembolic brain injury leading to cerebral hypoxia and brain damage seem to trigger the neurocognitive dysfunction in HF. Cognitive impairment is independently associated with worse outcomes including mortality, rehospitalization, and reduced quality of life. Patients with poorer cognitive function are at an increased risk of severe disease as they tend to have greater difficulty complying with treatment requirements. Coronary revascularization in patients with ischemic HF has the potential to improve cardiovascular outcomes but risks worsening neurocognitive dysfunction even further. Revascularization by coronary artery bypass grafting carries inherent risks for delirium, cognitive impairment, neurologic injury, and stroke, which are known to exacerbate the risk of neurocognitive dysfunction. Alternatively, percutaneous coronary intervention, as a less-invasive approach, has the potential to minimize the risk of cognitive impairment but has not yet been evaluated as an alternative to coronary artery bypass grafting in patients with ischemic HF. Therefore, it is paramount to raise awareness of the neurocognitive consequences in ischemic HF and devise strategies for recognition and prevention as an important target of patient management and personalized decision making that contributes to patient outcomes.
