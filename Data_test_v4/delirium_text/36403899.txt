36403899|a|According to the United Nations, by 2050, one in six individuals will be over age 65 globally, and one in four people would be aged 65 and older in western countries. The unprecedented growth of the aging population is associated with increased age-related disorders like Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Mild cognitive impairment (MCI). To date, no cure is known for AD, thus lifestyle interventions including calorie restriction (CR) and time-restricted eating (TRE) are proposed as potential approach to delay the onset and progression of the disease. Sleep disturbances are common in people with MCI and AD. Moreover, accumulating data indicates that pro-inflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10 increase in individuals with AD and MCI versus healthy subjects. Thus, the purpose of the present review is to describe the potential effects of TRE on sleep, cognition decline, and neuroinflammatory markers in humans. Preliminary evidence suggests that TRE may produce neuroprotective effects on cognition and reduce neuroinflammatory markers related to AD in humans. To date, no studies investigated the effects of TRE on sleep disturbances and patients with AD. Thereby, the impact of TRE on cognition in individuals with cognitive decline and AD needs to be investigated further in randomized controlled trials (RCTs).
