36145601|t|Nanoscale Delivery Systems of Lutein: An Updated Review from a Pharmaceutical Perspective.
36145601|a|Carotenoids are natural lipid-soluble pigments that produce yellow to red colors in plants as well as providing bright coloration in vegetables and fruits. Lutein belongs to the xanthophyll subgroup of the carotenoid family, which plays an essential role in photosynthesis and photoprotection in nature. In the human body, lutein, together with its isomer zeaxanthin and its metabolite meso-zeaxanthin, accumulates in the macula of the eye retina, which is responsible for central, high-resolution, and color vision. As a bioactive phytochemical, lutein has essential physiological functions, providing photoprotection against damaging blue light, along with the neutralization of oxidants and the preservation of the structural and functional integrity of cellular membranes. As a potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent, lutein unfortunately has a low bioavailability because of its lipophilicity and a low stability as a result of its conjugated double bonds. In order to enhance lutein stability and bioavailability and achieve its controlled delivery to a target, nanoscale delivery systems, which have great potential for the delivery of bioactive compounds, are starting to be employed. The current review highlights the advantages and innovations associated with incorporating lutein within promising nanoscale delivery systems, such as liposomes, nanoemulsions, polymer nanoparticles, and polymer-lipid hybrid nanoparticles, as well as their unique physiochemical properties.
