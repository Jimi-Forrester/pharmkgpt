27025652|a|Despite continuing debate about the amyloid beta-protein (or Abeta hypothesis, new lines of evidence from laboratories and clinics worldwide support the concept that an imbalance between production and clearance of Abeta42 and related Abeta peptides is a very early, often initiating factor in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Confirmation that presenilin is the catalytic site of gamma-secretase has provided a linchpin: all dominant mutations causing early-onset AD occur either in the substrate (amyloid precursor protein, APP) or the protease (presenilin) of the reaction that generates Abeta. Duplication of the wild-type APP gene in Down's syndrome leads to Abeta deposits in the teens, followed by microgliosis, astrocytosis, and neurofibrillary tangles typical of AD Apolipoprotein E4, which predisposes to AD in > 40% of cases, has been found to impair Abeta clearance from the brain. Soluble oligomers of Abeta42 isolated from AD patients' brains can decrease synapse number, inhibit long-term potentiation, and enhance long-term synaptic depression in rodent hippocampus, and injecting them into healthy rats impairs memory. The human oligomers also induce hyperphosphorylation of tau at AD-relevant epitopes and cause neuritic dystrophy in cultured neurons. Crossing human APP with human tau transgenic mice enhances tau-positive neurotoxicity. In humans, new studies show that low cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Abeta42 and amyloid-PET positivity precede other AD manifestations by many years. Most importantly, recent trials of three different Abeta antibodies (solanezumab, crenezumab, and aducanumab) have suggested a slowing of cognitive decline in post hoc analyses of mild AD subjects. Although many factors contribute to AD pathogenesis, Abeta dyshomeostasis has emerged as the most extensively validated and compelling therapeutic target.
