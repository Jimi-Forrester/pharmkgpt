29409855|a|Platelet-derived growth factors (PDGFs) and their receptors (PDGFRs) are expressed in several cell types including the brain cells such as neuronal progenitors, neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. Emerging evidence shows that PDGF-mediated signaling regulates diverse functions in the central nervous system (CNS) such as neurogenesis, cell survival, synaptogenesis, modulation of ligand-gated ion channels, and development of specific types of neurons. Interestingly, PDGF/PDFGR signaling can elicit paradoxical roles in the CNS, depending on the cell type and the activation stimuli and is implicated in the pathogenesis of various neurodegenerative diseases. This review summarizes the role of PDGFs/PDGFRs in several neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, brain cancer, cerebral ischemia, HIV-1 and drug abuse. Understanding PDGF/PDGFR signaling may lead to novel approaches for the future development of therapeutic strategies for combating CNS pathologies.
