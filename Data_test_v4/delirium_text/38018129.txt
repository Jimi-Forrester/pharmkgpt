38018129|a|ABSTRACT: Recent decades have seen the remarkable development of China in medical accessibility and quality index, and the application of a number of new advanced cardiovascular technologies benefits more patients. However, according to the Annual Report on Cardiovascular Health and Diseases in China published in this article, which was organized and summarized by National Center for Cardiovascular Diseases, there is still a huge population living with risk factors of cardiovascular diseases (CVD), and the morbidity and mortality of CVD are increasing. It is estimated that there are around 330 million patients suffering from CVD currently, including 245 million of hypertension, 13 million of stroke, 45.3 million of peripheral artery disease, 11.39 million of coronary heart disease (CHD), 8.9 million of heart failure, 5 million of pulmonary heart disease, 4.87 million of atrial fibrillation, 2.5 million of rheumatic heart disease, and 2 million of congenital heart disease. Tobacco use, diet and nutrition factors, physical activity, overweight and obesity, and psychological factors are what affect cardiovascular health, while hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, metabolic syndrome, and air pollution are the risk factors for CVD. In this article, in addition to risk factors for CVD, we also report the epidemiological trends of CVD, including CHD, cerebrovascular disease, arrhythmias, valvular heart disease, congenital heart disease, cardiomyopathy, heart failure, pulmonary vascular disease and venous thromboembolism, and aortic and peripheral artery diseases, as well as the basic research and medical device development in CVD. In a word, China has entered a new stage of transforming from high-speed development focusing on scale growth to high-quality development emphasizing on strategic and key technological development to curb the trend of increasing incidence and mortality of CVD.
