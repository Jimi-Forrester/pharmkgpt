Particularly, the risk of depression, sleep disorders, and Alzheimer's disease significantly increases in patients with mild cognitive impairment. To develop early treatment and prevention strategies for cognitive decline, it is necessary to individually identify the current state of cognitive function since the progression of cognitive decline varies among individuals. Therefore, the development of biomarkers that allow easier measurement of cognitive function in older individuals is relevant for hyperaged societies. One of the methods used to estimate cognitive function focuses on the temporal complexity of electroencephalography (EEG) signals. The characteristics of temporal complexity depend on the time scale, which reflects the range of neuron functional interactions. To capture the dynamics, composed of multiple time scales, multiscale entropy (MSE) analysis is effective for comprehensively assessing the neural activity underlying cognitive function in the brain. Thus, we hypothesized that EEG complexity analysis could serve to assess a wide range of cognitive functions in older adults. To validate our hypothesis, we divided older participants into two groups based on their cognitive function test scores: a high cognitive function group and a low cognitive function group, and applied MSE analysis to the measured EEG data of all participants. The results of the repeated-measures analysis of covariance using age and sex as a covariate in the MSE profile showed a significant difference between the high and low cognitive function groups (F = 10.18, p = 0.003) and the interaction of the group x electrodes (F = 3.93, p = 0.002). Subsequently, the results of the post-hoc t-test showed high complexity on a slower time scale in the frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes in the high cognitive function group. This high complexity on a slow time scale reflects the activation of long-distance neural interactions among various brain regions to achieve high cognitive functions. This finding could facilitate the development of a tool for diagnosis of cognitive decline in older individuals.
