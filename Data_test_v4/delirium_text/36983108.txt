36983108|t|Bone Cement and Its Anesthetic Complications: A Narrative Review.
36983108|a|The concept of bone cement implantation syndrome (BCIS) is not yet fully understood. In patients undergoing cemented hip arthroplasty, it is a significant factor in intraoperative mortality and morbidity. It may also manifest in a milder form postoperatively, resulting in hypoxia and confusion. In the older population, hip replacement surgery is becoming more prevalent. The risks of elderly patients suffering BCIS may be increased due to co-existing conditions. In this article, we present a narrative review of BCIS including its definition, incidence, risk factors, etiology, pathophysiology, clinical features, prevention, and management, all from an anesthetic point of view.
