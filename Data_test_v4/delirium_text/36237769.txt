36237769|t|Anxiety as a Risk Factor for Postoperative Delirium in Elective Spine Deformity Surgeries: A National Database Study.
36237769|a|Introduction Generalized anxiety disorder has become one of the most prevalent mental health disorders in the United States. In addition, postoperative delirium has been shown to increase hospital stay, increase mortality, and increased healthcare costs. Few studies have looked at the prevalence of postoperative delirium in patients diagnosed with anxiety undergoing elective spinal deformity procedures. The purpose of this study was to determine if anxiety is a risk factor for postoperative delirium in elective spinal deformity surgeries. Methods The authors performed a retrospective analysis using the TriNetX Research Database. Patients diagnosed with kyphosis or lordosis who then underwent elective spinal correction surgeries were identified. This group was then separated based on the diagnosis of a generalized anxiety disorder before the operation versus no diagnosis. Propensity score adjustment, based on mental disorders and other risk factors, was then used to match cohorts on baseline demographics and characteristics. Analysis was performed on the primary outcome of postoperative delirium, with secondary outcomes of upper respiratory tract infections, surgical site infections, sepsis, ventilator dependence, convulsions, stroke, emergency department visits, myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, and urinary retention within 30 days after surgery. Results Our search included 1,211 patients with a diagnosis of anxiety and 8,055 patients without anxiety. After propensity score matching, 996 patients remained in each cohort. Statistical analysis showed significant outcomes between the matched cohorts in the anxiety group for postoperative delirium (OR 2.788; 1.587-4.899) and convulsions (OR 1.615; 1.006-2.592). All other outcomes were not significant after propensity score matching. Conclusion These results showed generalized anxiety disorder is a risk factor for postoperative delirium and convulsions after elective spine surgery. Further research is necessary on the effects of mental health disorders on postoperative delirium and other outcomes to better understand the risks in this population.
