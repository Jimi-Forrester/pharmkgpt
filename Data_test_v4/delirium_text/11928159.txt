11928159|a|The documented under-use of respite programs in the face of unmet family caregiver needs is puzzling. The purpose of this study was to explore family caregivers' experience with a pilot respite program of weekend care for persons with Alzheimer disease (AD) or a related dementia. The goal-free evaluation approach captured the responses of 18 family caregivers to a pilot program developed by a community nursing organization. A content analysis of the caregiver interviews identified 3 categories: caregiver self-care, relief for the caregiver, and safety and comfort of the family member. The results suggest a link between the family caregiver achieving respite and the safety and comfort of the family member. The caregivers' perspective regarding the costs and benefits of respite influences the frequency with which they use the program. Research implications are discussed.
