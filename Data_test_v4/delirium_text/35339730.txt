35339730|a|In this special edition of the Biomedical Journal the reader gains an insight into drug-resistant epilepsy and according treatment approaches involving deep brain stimulation, the ketogenic diet and fecal microbiota transplant. Another emphasis is put on personalized medicine strategies, and covered in articles about the use of natriuretic peptides against cancer, along with an article about companion diagnostics involving extracellular vesicles. Recurrent infection with Clostridium difficile, associated risk factors and therapeutic options are discussed. We learn about a mechanism that helps Leishmania evade a host control mechanism, receive an update about human adenovirus and are presented with characteristic magnetic resonance neuroimaging in COVID-19 pediatric patients. An advanced assessment in pediatric septic shock and an improved model for a pediatric early warning system are proposed. Some of the genetic causes of renal hypomagnesemia are explored, the impact of air pollution on children is examined, and an antisiphon device is described for surgical treatment of hydrocephalus. The relation between energy metabolism, circadian rhythm and its influence on the ATPase in the SCN are investigated, and among others some of the genetics influencing smoking duration and lung cancer. Finally it is discussed how embryo quality can be improved in in vitro fertilization, and what impact high estradiol has on blastocyst implantation. The outcome of surgery to correct mandibular deficiency is assessed, and in two letters the inclusion of observational studies in the evaluation of clinical trials related to COVID-19 is elaborated.
