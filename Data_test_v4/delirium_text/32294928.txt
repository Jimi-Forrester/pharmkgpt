32294928|t|Enhancement of Amyloid beta1-43 Production in the Lens Epithelium of Japanese Type 2 Diabetic Patients.
32294928|a|We investigated whether the accumulation of amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) is enhanced in the lenses of diabetic patients. Lens epithelium samples were collected from Japanese patients during cataract surgery, and the Abeta levels and gene expression of Abeta-producing and -degrading enzymes in the samples were measured by ELISA and real-time RT-PCR, respectively. The Abeta 1-43 levels in lenses of non-diabetic patients were low (0.11 pmol/g protein), while the levels in lenses of diabetic patients were significantly (6-fold) higher. Moreover, the Abeta1-43/total-Abeta ratio in the lenses of diabetic patients was also significantly higher than non-diabetic patients (p < 0.05). In addition, the mRNA levels for Abeta-producing enzymes were also enhanced in the lenses of diabetic patients. In contrast to the results for Abeta-producing enzymes, the mRNAs for the Abeta-degrading enzymes in the lenses of diabetic patients were significantly lower than in non-diabetic patients (p < 0.05). Furthermore, Abeta 1-43/total-Abeta ratio in lenses was found to increase with plasma glucose level. In conclusion, these results suggest that high glucose levels cause both an increase in Abeta production and a decrease in Abeta degradation, and these changes lead to the enhancement in Abeta1-43 accumulation in the lenses of diabetic patients. These findings are useful for developing therapies for diabetic cataracts and for developing anti-cataract drugs.
