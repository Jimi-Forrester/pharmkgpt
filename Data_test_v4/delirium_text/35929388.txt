35929388|t|The relationship to the face: from the normal subject to the Alzheimer patient, from the naked face to the masked face, from a humanistic neuropsychology to an embodied ethics
35929388|a|The relationship to the face weaves close links with identity and otherness. It is not just a means of inter-human knowledge; it is also a major means of self/other communication underpinned by those mentalization networks that open up the attribution of intentions and emotions to others (theory of mind) as well as that particular disposition known as empathy, which enables us to put ourselves in another person's shoes by feeling and understanding what they are experiencing while remaining ourselves. Neuropsychology attempts to shed light on the brain processes that underlie this encounter with the face and that may be altered by neurodegenerative diseases, and in particular by Alzheimer's disease. The pandemic period also leads us to examine the clinical consequences of wearing a mask both in normal subjects and in subjects suffering from diseases that affect the relationship with the face of others. A humanistic neuropsychology must integrate an embodied ethics that attempts to discern what, in the perception of the Other, contributes to hindering the expression of otherness, which is inseparable from the human condition. In the pandemic context linked to Covid-19, neuropsychology with its clinical requirements and ethics with its performative aim on care practices, can thus cross-fertilize each other to propose compromises that are certainly attentive to public health but also to the well-being of each human being, especially the most vulnerable.
