33171799|a|The direct delivery of central nervous system (CNS) drugs into the brain after administration is an ideal concept due to its effectiveness and non-toxicity. However, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) prevents drugs from penetrating the capillary endothelial cells, blocking their entry into the brain. Thus, alternative approaches must be developed. The nasal cavity directly leads from the olfactory epithelium to the brain through the cribriform plate of the skull bone. Nose-to-brain drug delivery could solve the BBB-related repulsion problem. Recently, it has been revealed that insulin improved Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related dementia. Several ongoing AD clinical trials investigate the use of intranasal insulin delivery. Related to the real trajectory, intranasal labeled-insulins demonstrated distribution into the brain not only along the olfactory nerve but also the trigeminal nerve. Nonetheless, intranasally administered insulin was delivered into the brain. Therefore, insulin conjugates with covalent or non-covalent cargos, such as AD or other CNS drugs, could potentially contribute to a promising strategy to cure CNS-related diseases. In this review, I will introduce the CNS drug delivery approach into the brain using nanodelivery strategies for insulin through transcellular routes based on receptor-mediated transcytosis or through paracellular routes based on escaping the tight junction at the olfactory epithelium.
