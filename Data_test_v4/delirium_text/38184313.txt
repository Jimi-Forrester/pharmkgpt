38184313|t|Realist synthesis protocol on the effectiveness of a rapid response system in managing mental state deterioration in acute hospital settings.
38184313|a|INTRODUCTION: Patient mental state deterioration impacts patient outcomes, staff and increases costs for healthcare organisations. Mental state is broadly defined to include not only mental health but a broad range of cognitive, emotional and psychological well-being factors. Mental state deterioration is inconsistently identified and managed within acute and tertiary medical settings. This protocol aims to synthesise the evidence to test and refine initial programme theories that outline the functioning of a rapid response system. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This synthesis will be guided by Pawson's key steps in realist reviews. We will clarify the scope of synthesis through an initial literature search, focusing on understanding the functioning of rapid response system in managing patients presenting with mental state deterioration in acute hospital settings. Initial programme theories will be refined by developing a search strategy to comprehensively search electronic databases for relevant English language peer-reviewed studies. Additionally, we will search the grey literature for sources to supplement theory testing. An abstraction form will be developed to record the characteristics of literature sources. We will use spreadsheets to code and report contextual factors, underlying mechanisms, and outcome configurations. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: As this study is a realist synthesis protocol, ethics approval is not required. Synthesis findings will be published in a peer-reviewed journal and presented at scientific conferences.
