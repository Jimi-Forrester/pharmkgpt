22506327|a|The pathophysiology of delirium is poorly known and scientific evidence of effective forms of treatment is scarce. Detection of triggering factors and their appropriate treatment still constitute the cornerstone of the treatment. If drug therapy is required, an antipsychotic drug is the first-line treatment. Only in the case of the delirium tremens syndrome benzodiazepine is chosen as the first-line treatment. The use of restraint systems should be avoided. The delirium experience is often gravely traumatizing for the patient, and the psychological aftercare of delirium must therefore not be ignored.
