37508316|t|Benzimidazole-Triazole Hybrids as Antimicrobial and Antiviral Agents: A Systematic Review.
37508316|a|Bacterial infections have attracted the attention of researchers in recent decades, especially due to the special problems they have faced, such as their increasing diversity and resistance to antibiotic treatment. The emergence and development of the SARS-CoV-2 infection stimulated even more research to find new structures with antimicrobial and antiviral properties. Among the heterocyclic compounds with remarkable therapeutic properties, benzimidazoles, and triazoles stand out, possessing antimicrobial, antiviral, antitumor, anti-Alzheimer, anti-inflammatory, analgesic, antidiabetic, or anti-ulcer activities. In addition, the literature of the last decade reports benzimidazole-triazole hybrids with improved biological properties compared to the properties of simple mono-heterocyclic compounds. This review aims to provide an update on the synthesis methods of these hybrids, along with their antimicrobial and antiviral activities, as well as the structure-activity relationship reported in the literature. It was found that the presence of certain groups grafted onto the benzimidazole and/or triazole nuclei (-F, -Cl, -Br, -CF3, -NO2, -CN, -CHO, -OH, OCH3, COOCH3), as well as the presence of some heterocycles (pyridine, pyrimidine, thiazole, indole, isoxazole, thiadiazole, coumarin) increases the antimicrobial activity of benzimidazole-triazole hybrids. Also, the presence of the oxygen or sulfur atom in the bridge connecting the benzimidazole and triazole rings generally increases the antimicrobial activity of the hybrids. The literature mentions only benzimidazole-1,2,3-triazole hybrids with antiviral properties. Both for antimicrobial and antiviral hybrids, the presence of an additional triazole ring increases their biological activity, which is in agreement with the three-dimensional binding mode of compounds. This review summarizes the advances of benzimidazole triazole derivatives as potential antimicrobial and antiviral agents covering articles published from 2000 to 2023.
