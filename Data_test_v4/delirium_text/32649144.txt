32649144|t|Fat Embolism Syndrome: The Ambiguity of Diagnosis in the Postarthroplasty Patient: A Case Report.
32649144|a|CASE: We present the case of an otherwise healthy, 74-year-old woman, who underwent bilateral hip arthroplasty and subsequently presented with decreased level of consciousness, mimicking a severe postoperative delirium. After several days and investigations, the diagnosis of fat embolism syndrome (FES) was reached, and appropriate management was given. CONCLUSION: Orthopedic surgeons and their teams should consider FES as a differential diagnosis of prolonged post-operative delirium. With supportive management these patients can make a full recovery without lasting neurological symptoms. Our patient has shown no subsequent sequelae after 10-month follow-up.
