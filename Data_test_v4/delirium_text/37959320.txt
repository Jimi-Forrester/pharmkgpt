37959320|t|The Levels of Leptin, Cystatin C, Neuropilin-1 and Tau Protein in Relation to Dietary Habits in Patients with Alzheimer's Disease.
37959320|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia in older people. Its prevalence is expected to increase, and therefore it poses a serious challenge to the healthcare system. The aim of the study was to assess the concentration of leptin, cystatin C, neuropilin-1 and tau protein, as well as the influence of dietary habits on these parameters, in a group of AD patients (n = 110) compared to 60 healthy people (n = 60). It has been shown that AD patients, compared to healthy people, are characterized by significantly higher median concentrations of leptin (9.97 vs. 3.08), cystatin c (1.53 vs. 0.56) and tau protein (8.46 vs. 4.19), but significantly lower median neuropilin-1 (69.94 vs. 167.28). Multiple regression analyses showed that leptin levels could be explained by dietary habits in 27%, cystatin C in 51%, neuropilin-1 in 41% and tau protein in 25% of cases. Modification of eating habits may contribute to improving the values of the discussed parameters.
