39835873|a|Delirium is an acute change in attention and awareness that fluctuates and is accompanied by cognitive impairment. Patients with delirium may have disorders of perception such as hallucinations and delusions. The condition is triggered by acute illness or injury, and the risk is highest in sick older patients and patients in intensive care. Because delirium is associated with a poor prognosis, it is important to prevent delirium, quickly identify patients who nevertheless develop the condition, and treat causal triggers. In this clinical review article we present current knowledge about delirium in older patients both in and outside of hospital.
