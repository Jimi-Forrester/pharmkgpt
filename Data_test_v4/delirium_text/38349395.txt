38349395|t|A current review on P2X7 receptor antagonist patents in the treatment of neuroinflammatory disorders: a patent review on antagonists.
38349395|a|Chronic inflammation is defined by an activated microglial state linked to all neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (a motor neuron disease that affects the brain and spinal cord). P2X7 receptors (P2X7R) are ATP-activated ion-gated channels present on microglial surfaces. Prolonged ATP release under pathological settings results in sustained P2X7R activation, which leads to inflammasome development and cytokine release. P2X7R and its enabling roles have recently been linked to neurodegenerative diseases, making it a potential research subject. This research provides an overview of current patents for chemicals, biologics, and medicinal applications. The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), European Patent Office (EPO, Espacenet), and the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) databases were searched for patents using the keywords "P2X7R and Neuroinflammation." During the study period from 2015 to 2021, 103 patents were examined. The countries that protected these innovations were the United States, PCT (Patent Cooperation Treaty states), Europe, Canada, Australia, and India. Janssen Pharmaceutica NV had the most applications, followed by Acetelion Pharmaceuticals LTD., Renovis Inc., Kelly Michael G, Kincaid Jhon, Merck Patent GMBH, H Lundbeck A/S, and many more. The P2X7R is a possible diagnostic and therapeutic target for cancer, pain disorders, and inflammation. For P2X7 R, several compounds have been discovered and are presently the subject of clinical trial investigations. This study featured patents for P2X7R antagonists, which help treat conditions including neuroinflammation.
