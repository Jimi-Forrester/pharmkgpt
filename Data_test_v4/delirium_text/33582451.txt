33582451|t|The application of multifunctional nanomaterials in Alzheimer's disease: A potential theranostics strategy.
33582451|a|By virtue of their small size, nanomaterials can cross the blood-brain barrier and, when modified to target specific cells or regions, can achieve high bioavailability at the intended site of action. Modified nanomaterials are therefore promising agents for the diagnosis and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here we review the roles and mechanisms of action of nanomaterials in AD. First, we discuss the general characteristics of nanomaterials and their application to nanomedicine. Then, we summarize recent studies on the diagnosis and treatment of AD using modified nanomaterials. These studies indicate that using nanomaterials is a potential strategy for AD treatment by slowing the progression of AD through enhanced therapeutic effects.
