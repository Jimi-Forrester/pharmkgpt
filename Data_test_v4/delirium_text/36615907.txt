36615907|a|High-fat diet (HFD) intake is commonly related to a substantial risk of cognitive impairment for senior citizens over 65 years of age, which constitutes a profound global health burden with several economic and social consequences. It is critical to investigate the effects of long-term HFD consumption on cognitive function and to inspect the potential underlying mechanisms. In the present study, 9-month-old male C57BL/6 mice were randomly assigned to either a normal diet (ND, 10 kcal% fat) or an HFD diet (60 kcal% fat) for 10 months. Then a series of behavioral tests, and histological and biochemistry examinations of the hippocampus and cortex proceeded. We found that long-term HFD-fed aged mice exhibited cognitive function decline in the object place recognition test (OPR). Compared with the ND group, the HFD-fed mice showed Tau hyperphosphorylation at ps214 in the hippocampus and at ps422 and ps396 in the cortex, which was accompanied by GSK-3beta activation. The higher activated phenotype of microglia in the brain of the HFD group was typically evidenced by an increased average area of the cell body and reduced complexity of microglial processes. Immunoblotting showed that long-term HFD intake augmented the levels of inflammatory cytokines IL-6 in the hippocampus. These findings indicate that long-term HFD intake deteriorates cognitive dysfunctions, accompanied by Tau hyperphosphorylation, microglial activation, and inflammatory cytokine expression, and that the modifiable lifestyle factor contributes to the cognitive decline of senior citizens.
