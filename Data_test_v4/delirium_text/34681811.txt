34681811|t|The Amyloid Forming Peptides Islet Amyloid Polypeptide and Amyloid beta Interact at the Molecular Level.
34681811|a|Epidemiological studies support a connection between the two common disorders, type-2 diabetes and Alzheimer's disease. Both conditions have local amyloid formation in their pathogenesis, and cross-seeding between islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) and amyloid beta (Abeta) could constitute the link. The bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay was used to investigate the occurrence of heterologous interactions between IAPP and Abeta and to compare the potential toxic effects of IAPP/Abeta, IAPP/IAPP, and Abeta/Abeta expression in living cells. Microscopy was used to confirm the fluorescence and determine the lysosomal, mitochondrial areas and mitochondrial membrane potential, and a FACS analysis was used to determine ROS production and the role for autophagy. Drosophila melanogaster expressing IAPP and Abeta was used to study their co-deposition and effects on longevity. We showed that the co-expression of IAPP and Abeta resulted in fluorophore reconstitution to the same extent as determined for homologous IAPP/IAPP or Abeta/Abeta expression. The BiFC(+)/BiFC(-) ratio of lysosomal area calculations increased in transfected cells independent of the vector combinations, while only Abeta/Abeta expression increased mitochondrial membrane potential. Expression combinations containing Abeta were necessary for the formation of a congophilic amyloid. In Drosophila melanogaster expressing IAPP/Abeta, co-deposition of the amyloid-forming peptides caused reduced longevity. The BiFC results confirmed a heterologous interaction between IAPP and Abeta, while co-deposits in the brain of Drosophila suggest mixed amyloid aggregates.
