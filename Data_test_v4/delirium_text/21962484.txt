21962484|t|New developments on the role of NMDA receptors in Alzheimer's disease.
21962484|a|Since the initial findings that NMDA receptors play important roles in cellular models of learning as well as neurotoxicity, abnormal function of this receptor has been considered a potential mechanism in the pathophysiology underlying Alzheimer's disease. Treatment of Alzheimer's disease with an NMDA receptor antagonist began several years ago, with some limited success. More recent mechanistic studies have examined the role of NMDA receptors in the synaptic effects of beta amyloid (Abeta).
