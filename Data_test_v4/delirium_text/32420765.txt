32420765|a|PURPOSE: To review the recent developments on the effect of chronic high mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) on cerebral blood flow (CBF) autoregulation and supporting the notion that CBF autoregulation impairment has connection with chronic cerebral diseases. Method: A narrative review of all the relevant papers known to the authors was conducted. Results: Our understanding of the connection between cerebral perfusion impairment and chronic high MAP and cerebral disease is rapidly evolving, from cerebral perfusion impairment being the result of cerebral diseases to being the cause of cerebral diseases. We now better understand the intertwined impact of hypertension and Alzheimer's disease (AD) on cerebrovascular sensory elements and recognize cerebrovascular elements that are more vulnerable to these diseases. Conclusion: We conclude with the suggestion that the sensory elements pathology plays important roles in intertwined mechanisms of chronic high MAP and AD that impact cerebral perfusion.
