29301146|t|A Self-Microemulsifying Formulation of Oxyresveratrol Prevents Amyloid Beta Protein-Induced Neurodegeneration in Mice.
29301146|a|The polyphenol compound, oxyresveratrol (OXY) possesses potent antioxidant and neuroprotective properties of potential utility in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. However, the low oral bioavailability limits its neuroprotective effect and clinical application. The neuroprotective effect of orally administered OXY-loaded self-microemulsifying drug delivery system (OXY-SMEDDS) was compared with free OXY in vivo. Mice were orally administered either free OXY or OXY-SMEDDS once daily at a dose of 90, 180, or 360 mg/kg for 14 d. Mice received a single intracerebroventricular injection of the neurotoxic amyloid beta (Abeta)25 - 35 peptide at day 8 during oral treatment. The OXY-SMEDDS formulation resulted in four-times reduction of the free OXY dose required for prevention of neurotoxicity effects due to Abeta25 - 35 peptide as demonstrated by a significant decline in behavior impairments, lipid oxidation levels, and neuronal cell loss in all hippocampal subfields (p < 0.0001). These results indicate the potential of OXY-SMEDDS by oral delivery to improve the efficacy of this compound in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
