37779566|a|Nowadays, the pre-operative evaluation of older patients is a critical step in the decision-making process. Clinical assessment and care planning should be considered a whole process rather than separate issues. Clinicians should use validated tools for pre-operative risk assessment of older patients to minimize surgery-related morbidity and mortality and enhance care quality. Traditional pre-operative consultation often fails to capture the pathophysiological and functional profiles of older patients. The elderly's pre-operative evaluation should be focused on determining the patient's functional reserve and reducing any possible peri-operative risk. Therefore, older adults may benefit from the Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) that allows clinicians to evaluate several aspects of elderly life, such as depression and cognitive disorders, social status, multi-morbidity, frailty, geriatric syndromes, nutritional status, and polypharmacy. Despite the recognized challenges in applying the CGA, it may provide a realistic risk assessment for post-operative complications and suggest a tailored peri-operative treatment plan for older adults, including pre-operative optimization strategies. The older adults' pre-operative examination should not be considered a mere stand-alone, that is, an independent stage of the surgical pathway, but rather a vital step toward a personalized therapeutic approach that may involve professionals from different clinical fields. The aim of this review is to revise the evidence from the literature and highlight the most important items to be implemented in the pre-operative evaluation process in order to identify better all elderly patients' needs.
