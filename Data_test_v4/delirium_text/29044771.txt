29044771|a|INTRODUCTION: Enzymatic inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is an essential therapeutic target for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and AChE inhibitors are the first-line drugs for it treatment. However, butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), contributes critically to cholinergic dysfunction associated with AD. Thus, the development of novel therapeutics may involve the inhibition of both cholinesterase enzymes. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate, in an integrated bioguided study, cholinesterases alkaloidal inhibitors of Amaryllidaceae species. METHODOLOGY: The proposed method combines high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) with data analysis by densitometry, enzymatic bioautography with different AChEs and BChEs, the detection of bioactive molecules through gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of spots of interest, and theoretical in silico studies. RESULTS: To evaluate the bioguided method, the AChE and BChE inhibitory activities of seven Amaryllidaceae plant extracts were evaluated. The alkaloid extracts of Eucharis bonplandii exhibited a high level of inhibitory activity (IC50  = 0.72 +- 0.05 mug/mL) against human recombinant AChE (hAChE). Regarding human serum BChE (hBChE), the bulb and leaf extracts of Crinum jagus had the highest activity (IC50  = 8.51 +- 0.56 mug/mL and 11.04 +- 1.21 mug/mL, respectively). In the HPTLC spots with high inhibitory activity, several alkaloids were detected using GC-MS, and some of these alkaloids were identified. Galanthamine, galanthamine N-oxide and powelline should be the most prominent inhibitors of substrate accommodation in the active site of the Torpedo californica AChE (TcAChE), hAChE and hBChE enzymes. CONCLUSIONS: These results are evidence of the chemical relevance of the Colombian's Amaryllidaceae species for the inhibition of cholinesterases and as potent sources for the palliative treatment of AD.
