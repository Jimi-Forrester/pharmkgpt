32246619|a|The over-activated microglial cells induce neuroinflammation which has the main role in neurological disorders. The over-activated microglia can disturb neuronal function by releasing inflammatory mediators leading to neuronal dysfunctions and death. Thus, inhibition of over-activated microglia may be an effective therapeutic approach for modulating neuroinflammation. Experimental studies have indicated anti-neuroinflammatory effects of flavonoids such as green tea catechins. The current research was aimed to review the effect of green tea catechins in inhibiting microglial cells, inflammatory cascades, and subsequent neurological diseases.
