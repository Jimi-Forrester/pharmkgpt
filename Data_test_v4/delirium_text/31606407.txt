31606407|a|Deltamethrin (DM) is widely used in agriculture, veterinary medicine and control of domestic pests. Epidemiological studies suggest that DM exposure is a risk factor for neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's (PD) and Alzheimer diseases; however the mechanisms are elusive. In the present study we evaluated the effects of intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of DM on locomotion activity, spatial working memory and dopaminergic pathway in the rat. Middle-aged male Wistar rats received three i.c.v. injections of DM 0.5 mug, DM 5 mug or vehicle, every other day. Across the treatment, the animals were submitted to behavioral evaluation in the catalepsy test, open field test, and spontaneous alternation task. Following completion of behavioral tests, rats were perfused and their brains were processed to tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunohistochemistry. We observed that i.c.v. administration of DM 5 mug increased locomotion activity (open field) and caused spatial working memory impairment (spontaneous alternation task). These alterations were accompanied by reduction TH immunoreactivity in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc), ventral tegmental area (VTA) and dorsal striatum. Conversely, no motor change was observed in the catalepsy test. These results indicate that i.c.v. administration of DM can cause hyperactivity and cognitive alteration which may be related to disruption of the dopaminergic pathway.
