35624818|a|Understanding the sequelae of COVID-19 is of utmost importance. Neuroinflammation and disturbed redox homeostasis are suggested as prevailing underlying mechanisms in neurological sequelae propagation in long-COVID. We aimed to investigate whether variations in antioxidant genetic profile might be associated with neurological sequelae in long-COVID. Neurological examination and antioxidant genetic profile (SOD2, GPXs and GSTs) determination, as well as, genotype analysis of Nrf2 and ACE2, were conducted on 167 COVID-19 patients. Polymorphisms were determined by the appropriate PCR methods. Only polymorphisms in GSTP1AB and GSTO1 were independently associated with long-COVID manifestations. Indeed, individuals carrying GSTP1 Val or GSTO1 Asp allele exhibited lower odds of long-COVID myalgia development, both independently and in combination. Furthermore, the combined presence of GSTP1 Ile and GSTO1 Ala alleles exhibited cumulative risk regarding long-COVID myalgia in carriers of the combined GPX1 LeuLeu/GPX3 CC genotype. Moreover, individuals carrying combined GSTM1-null/GPX1LeuLeu genotype were more prone to developing long-COVID "brain fog", while this probability further enlarged if the Nrf2 A allele was also present. The fact that certain genetic variants of antioxidant enzymes, independently or in combination, affect the probability of long-COVID manifestations, further emphasizes the involvement of genetic susceptibility when SARS-CoV-2 infection is initiated in the host cells, and also months after.
