36071029|t|Noise pareidolia test for predicting delirium in hospitalized older patients with cognitive decline.
36071029|a|AIM: Although older people are at an increased risk of developing delirium during hospitalization, no definitive screening tools exist to predict the condition. This study aimed to examine the effectiveness of the noise pareidolia test (NPT) as a tool for predicting the onset of post-hospitalization delirium in older adults. METHODS: Hospitalized patients who were cared for by a multidisciplinary geriatric care team owing to behavioral symptoms, difficulties in communication, and a history of dementia or delirium were analyzed. The NPT was performed on patients who could complete a Mini-Mental State Examination within 3 days of admission. Demographic and clinical data were recorded on the same day as the NPT or within 3 days of admission. Delirium was assessed using the observation-based Delirium Screening Tool (DST). RESULTS: Of 96 patients, 59 were in the DST-negative group and 37 in the DST-positive group. Benzodiazepine agonist use, serum potassium levels, and the number of images in which pareidolia was noted (i.e., the NPT score) significantly differed between groups. Logistic regression analysis identified benzodiazepine agonist use (odds ratio, 2.897; P = 0.032), serum potassium levels (odds ratio, 0.427; P = 0.041) and NPT scores (odds ratio, 1.253; P = 0.017) as significant predictors of DST results. The receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed an NPT score of 1 as the appropriate cutoff value. CONCLUSIONS: A positive NPT score was identified as an independent predictor of delirium in older patients admitted to an acute care hospital with cognitive dysfunction.
