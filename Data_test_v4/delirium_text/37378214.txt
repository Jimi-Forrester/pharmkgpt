37378214|t|Early Diagnostic Measures to Confirm the Diagnosis of Human Prion Diseases.
37378214|a|Human prion diseases are a group of rare and fatal diseases without a cure. Symptoms include rapidly progressive dementia, ataxia, myoclonus, akinetic mutism, and visual disturbances. A broad differential is required to consider prion disease as a diagnosis and rule out other conditions. Historically, to confirm the diagnosis of prion disease, a brain biopsy was needed. Over the past few decades, brain MRI, video electroencephalogram, lumbar puncture results, and a thorough clinical assessment have helped arrive at a probable diagnosis. We present the case of a 60-year-old female with a rapidly worsening altered mental status who received an early diagnosis of prion disease with the help of imaging and lab results. This case shows that a timely diagnosis of prion disease is important to allow the patient and their families to prepare for the inevitable fatality of the disease and discuss the goals of care.
