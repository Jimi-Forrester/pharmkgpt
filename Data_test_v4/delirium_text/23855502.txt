23855502|t|The potential mechanisms of Abeta-receptor for advanced glycation end-products interaction disrupting tight junctions of the blood-brain barrier in Alzheimer's disease.
23855502|a|The receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) is a multiligand membrane receptor that has been implicated in the cytotoxicity effects of beta-amyloid protein (Abeta) in AD. Positive feedback mechanism of RAGE within blood-brain barrier (BBB) and/or cells inside the brain is proposed, including interaction with Abeta stimulating activation of proinflammatory cytokines, release of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which leads to neuron damage and BBB dysfunction. RAGE is the main factor mediating Abeta cytotoxicity. Attenuation of RAGE activity may inhibit Abeta from accumulation in the cerebral blood vessels and prevent neurotoxicity. Furthermore, RAGE may serve as a therapeutic target for Alzheimer's disease by inhibiting pathophysiological consequences of Abeta-RAGE interaction. Tight junctions (TJ) are identified as the basic structure of the BBB and RAGE-mediated Abeta cytotoxicity to the brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMEC), resulting in damaged BBB structural integrity. However, the potential mechanism is poorly studied.
