38420694|t|The estrogen receptor and metabolism.
38420694|a|Across the globe, metabolic syndrome, hyperuric acid, and their related diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and insulin resistance, are increasing in incidence due to metabolic imbalances. Due to the pathogenesis, women are more prone to these diseases than men. As estrogen levels decrease after menopause, obesity and metabolic disorders are more likely to occur. Men are also affected by hyperuric acid. To provide ideas for the prevention and treatment of metabolic syndrome and hyperuricemia, this article reviews and analyzes the relationship between estrogen receptors, metabolic syndrome, and hyperuricemia.
