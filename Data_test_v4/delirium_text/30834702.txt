30834702|a|BACKGROUND: Mild hypothermia is wildly used in clinical treatment of traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, the effect of mild hypothermia on endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced apoptosis after severe TBI is still unknown. METHODS: In the present study, we used BALB/c mice to investigate the efficacy of posttraumatic mild hypothermia in reducing ER stress. Severe TBI was induced by controlled cortical impact injury. Mild hypothermia treatment was performed immediately after surgery and maintained for 4 hr. The animals were euthanized at 1 and 7 days after severe TBI. The expression levels of ER stress marker proteins were evaluated using Western blot and immunofluorescence. Cell apoptosis rate was analyzed by TUNEL staining. Neuronal functions of the mice were assessed using rotarod test and Morris water maze. RESULTS: Our results revealed that mild hypothermia significantly attenuated ER stress marker proteins, including p-eIF2alpha/eIF2alpha, ATF4, CHOP and IRE-1alpha, and reduced apoptosis rate in the pericontusion region at 1 and 7 days after severe TBI. Interestingly, mild hypothermia also prevented the translocation of CHOP into nucleus. In addition, posttraumatic mild hypothermia significantly improved neuronal functions after severe TBI. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings illustrated that mild hypothermia could reduce ER stress-induced apoptosis and improve neuronal functions after severe traumatic brain injury.
