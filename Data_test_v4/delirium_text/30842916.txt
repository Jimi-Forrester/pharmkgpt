30842916|t|Rates of new antipsychotic prescriptions and continuation at discharge from a medical unit in a community teaching hospital serving rural counties.
30842916|a|INTRODUCTION: Antipsychotics are commonly used during hospitalization to manage a variety of acute indications and may be inadvertently continued at discharge. The purpose of this study was to identify the rate at which patients admitted to nonpsychiatric units were continued on newly prescribed antipsychotics at discharge from a rural community teaching hospital. METHODS: This study was a retrospective chart review of adult patients admitted to a large community teaching hospital and initiated on an antipsychotic from August 1, 2016, to August 31, 2017. Exclusion criteria were patients admitted to psychiatric or obstetrics/gynecology services, with a diagnosis of a psychotic disorder, or on an antipsychotic prior to hospitalization. The primary outcome measure was the number of new antipsychotic prescriptions during hospitalization that were continued at discharge. Secondary outcomes included antipsychotic characteristics and initiation indications. Descriptive statistics were used to describe antipsychotic use and demographic data. RESULTS: Of 100 patients included, 3 patients were discharged on an antipsychotic. Two patients had questionable indications, and 1 patient had a new psychotic disorder diagnosis. Of all antipsychotics newly initiated during hospitalization, haloperidol was the most commonly prescribed antipsychotic. The majority of doses were scheduled as 1-time or as-needed doses. Approximately 20% of antipsychotics were administered orally. No relevant indication was found for 35% of patients newly initiated on antipsychotics, and documented indications included agitation, psychosis, delirium, and anxiety. DISCUSSION: In an institution that largely serves a rural population, antipsychotic prescribing at discontinuation was not worse than what has been previously reported in other regions of the United States. Limitations for this study include the retrospective nature, single-center study, and small sample size. Although there was a lack of continuation after discharge, there was also a deficit of documentation with 35% of the antipsychotic initiations having no documented indication.
