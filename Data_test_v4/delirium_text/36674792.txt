36674792|t|A Genome-Wide Functional Screen Identifies Enhancer and Protective Genes for Amyloid Beta-Peptide Toxicity.
36674792|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is known to be caused by amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) misfolded into beta-sheets, but this knowledge has not yet led to treatments to prevent AD. To identify novel molecular players in Abeta toxicity, we carried out a genome-wide screen in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, using a library of 5154 gene knock-out strains expressing Abeta1-42. We identified 81 mammalian orthologue genes that enhance Abeta1-42 toxicity, while 157 were protective. Next, we performed interactome and text-mining studies to increase the number of genes and to identify the main cellular functions affected by Abeta oligomers (oAbeta). We found that the most affected cellular functions were calcium regulation, protein translation and mitochondrial activity. We focused on SURF4, a protein that regulates the store-operated calcium channel (SOCE). An in vitro analysis using human neuroblastoma cells showed that SURF4 silencing induced higher intracellular calcium levels, while its overexpression decreased calcium entry. Furthermore, SURF4 silencing produced a significant reduction in cell death when cells were challenged with oAbeta1-42, whereas SURF4 overexpression induced Abeta1-42 cytotoxicity. In summary, we identified new enhancer and protective activities for Abeta toxicity and showed that SURF4 contributes to oAbeta1-42 neurotoxicity by decreasing SOCE activity.
