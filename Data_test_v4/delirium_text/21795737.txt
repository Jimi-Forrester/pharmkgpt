21795737|t|Sex steroid hormones and reproductive disorders: impact on women's health.
21795737|a|The role of sex steroid hormones in reproductive function in women is well established. However, in the last two decades it has been shown that receptors for estrogens, progesterone and androgens are expressed in non reproductive tissue /organs (bone, brain, cardiovascular system) playing a role in their function. Therefore, it is critical to evaluate the impact of sex steroid hormones in the pathophysiology of some diseases (osteoporosis, Alzheimer, atherosclerosis). In particular, women with primary ovarian insufficiency, polycystic ovary syndrome, endometriosis and climacteric syndrome may have more health problems and therefore an hormonal treatment may be crucial for these women.
