39518139|a|BACKGROUND: Transactivation Response Element RNA-binding Protein (TRBP2) is a double-stranded RNA-binding protein widely known for its critical contribution to RNA interference (RNAi), a conserved mechanism of gene-expression regulation mediated through small non-coding RNA moieties (ncRNAs). Nevertheless, TRBP2 has also proved to be involved in other molecular pathways and biological processes, such as cell growth, organism development, spermatogenesis, and stress response. Mutations or aberrant expression of TRBP2 have been previously associated with diverse human pathologies, including Alzheimer's disease, cardiomyopathy, and cancer, with TRBP2 playing an essential role(s) in proliferation, invasion, and metastasis of tumor cells. METHODS: Hence, the present study aims to investigate, via employment of advanced flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, cell transgenesis and bioinformatics technologies, new, still elusive, functions and properties of TRBP2, particularly regarding its cell cycle-specific control during cancer cell division. RESULTS: We have identified a novel, mitosis-dependent regulation of TRBP2 protein expression, as clearly evidenced by the lack of its immunofluorescence-facilitated detection during mitotic phases, in several human cancer cell lines of different tissue origin. Notably, the obtained TRBP2-downregulation patterns seem to derive from molecular mechanisms that act independently of oncogenic activities (e.g., malignancy grade), metastatic capacities (e.g., low versus high), and mutational signatures (e.g., p53-/- or p53DeltaUpsilon126) of cancer cells. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, we herein propose that TRBP2 serves as a novel cell cycle-dependent regulator, likely exerting mitosis-suppression functions, and, thus, its mitosis-specific downregulation can hold strong promise to be exploited for the efficient and successful prognosis, diagnosis, and (radio-/chemo-)therapy of diverse human malignancies, in the clinic.
