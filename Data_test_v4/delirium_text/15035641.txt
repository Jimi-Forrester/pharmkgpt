15035641|a|Alpha-synuclein is a pathological component of Parkinson's disease by constituting the filamentous component of Lewy bodies. Phthalocyanine (Pc) effects on the amyloidosis of alpha-synuclein have been examined. The copper complex of phthalocyanine tetrasulfonate (PcTS-Cu(2+)) caused the self-oligomerization of alpha-synuclein while Pc-Cu(2+) did not affect the protein, indicating that introduction of the sulfonate groups was critical for the selective protein interaction. The PcTS-Cu(2+) interaction with alpha-synuclein has occurred predominantly at the N-terminal region of the protein with a K(d) of 0.83 microM apart from the hydrophobic NAC (non-Abeta component of Alzheimer's disease amyloid) segment. Phthalocyanine tetrasulfonate (PcTS) lacking the intercalated copper ion also showed a considerable affinity toward alpha-synuclein with a K(d) of 3.12 microM, and its binding site, on the other hand, was located at the acidic C-terminus. These mutually exclusive interactions between PcTS and PcTS-Cu(2+) toward alpha-synuclein resulted in distinctive features on the kinetics of protein aggregation, morphologies of the final aggregates, and their in vitro cytotoxicities. The PcTS actually suppressed the fibrous amyloid formation of alpha-synuclein, but it produced the chopped-wood-looking protein aggregates. The aggregates showed rather low toxicity (9.5%) on human neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y). In fact, the PcTS was shown to effectively rescue the cell death of alpha-synuclein overexpressing cells caused by the lactacystin treatment as a proteasome inhibitor. The anti-aggregative and anti-amyloidogenic properties of PcTS were also demonstrated with alcohol dehydrogenase, glutathione S-transferase, and amyloid beta/A4 protein under their aggregative conditions. The PcTS-Cu(2+), on the other hand, promoted the protein aggregation of alpha-synuclein, which gave rise to the fibrillar protein aggregates whose cytotoxicity became significant to 35.8%. Taken together, the data provided in this study indicate that PcTS/PcTS-Cu(2+) could be considered as possible candidates for the development of therapeutic or prophylactic strategies against the alpha-synuclein-related neurodegenerative disorders.
