37406334|t|International Consensus Recommendation Guidelines for Subcutaneous Infusions of Hydration and Medication in Adults: An e-Delphi Consensus Study.
37406334|a|Infusion of fluids and medications is traditionally performed intravenously. However, venous depletion in patients has led to the quest for vessel health preservation. A safe, effective, acceptable, and efficient alternative is the subcutaneous route. A lack of organizational policies may contribute to the slow uptake of this practice. This modified e-Delphi (electronic) study aimed to derive international consensus on practice recommendations for subcutaneous infusions of fluids and medications. A panel of 11 international clinicians, with expertise in subcutaneous infusion research and/or clinical practice, rated and edited subcutaneous infusion practice recommendations from evidence, clinical practice guidelines, and clinical expertise within an Assessment, Best Practice, and Competency (ABC) domain guideline model. The ABC Model for Subcutaneous Infusion Therapy provides a systematic guideline of 42 practice recommendations for the safe delivery of subcutaneous infusions of fluids and medications in the adult population in all care settings. These consensus recommendations provide a guideline for health care providers, organizations, and policy makers to optimize use of the subcutaneous access route.
