39421082|t|Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy: A Comprehensive Narrative Review of Its Biomarkers.
39421082|a|Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a progressive and fatal neurological disorder linked to repeated traumatic brain injuries (TBIs), including concussions and blows to the head. This condition is characterized by the accumulation of abnormally structured hyperphosphorylated tau proteins (p-tau), forming neurofibrillary tangles, astrocytic tangles, and neurites in the brain. CTE is often diagnosed post-mortem, making it challenging to diagnose and predict its progression in living individuals. Despite recent advancements, no definitive pathological, radiological, or neurobiological marker consistently shows promise in diagnosing and predicting the disease. This review aims to summarize the available techniques and advancements in imaging-based, genetic, neuropsychological, and fluid biomarkers for CTE, evaluating their specificity and sensitivity. It will also highlight the limitations of each marker in diagnosing CTE and provide future research directions to enhance the accuracy of CTE diagnosis in living individuals.
