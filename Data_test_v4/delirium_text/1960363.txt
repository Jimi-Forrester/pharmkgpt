1960363|a|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of geriatric psychiatry consultation in reducing the severity of confusion, anxiety, depression, abnormal behavior, and functional disability among a selected group of aged medical and surgical inpatients. DESIGN: Randomized clinical trial. Cases assessed on enrollment at 2, 4, and 8 weeks later. SETTING: Primary acute care hospital. PATIENTS: Eighty hospitalized patients aged 65 or older who were referred to a multi-disciplinary team and had not received a psychiatric consultation in the month prior to referral. Sixty-three patients completed the trial. INTERVENTIONS: Patients in the treatment group received a geriatric psychiatry consultation and, when appropriate, follow-up at least once per week for 8 weeks. Control patients received usual medical care. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire, Anxiety Status Inventory, Geriatric Depression Rating Scale, and Crichton Geriatric Behavioral Rating Scale. RESULTS: The effect of the consultation on psychiatric symptoms and functional status was positive but small. The differences in scores of all measures between treatment and control groups were not statistically significant, but there were consistent trends for more treatment than control cases to have improved on all measures, significantly so on the Anxiety Status Inventory (P less than 0.05). Cases with delirium or depression improved most often. More control than treatment cases were discharged after 4 and 8 weeks, but twice as many treatment cases were discharged home. CONCLUSIONS: Geriatric psychiatry consultation, while not highly effective overall, may be beneficial if targeted to those most likely to benefit and compliance by referring physicians can be improved.
