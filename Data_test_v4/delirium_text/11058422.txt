11058422|a|According to an uncritically accepted axiom, the human brain's capacity for longer-term memory storage is never overloaded. This viewpoint is shown to be contrary to all evidence and beyond reasonable credibility. The entire currently obtainable evidence for or against overload comes via the presence or absence of its manifestation in behaviour. This manifestation would be as an incurable, deteriorating, specific form of memory disorder, associated with old age and consequent to increased data-inputting and reductions of brain capacity. There is in fact such a disorder, namely Alzheimer's disease and other dementia. This relationship provides elegant explanations for various peculiar findings, without encountering any counter-evidence. The premorbid accumulation of tangles in the hippocampus is explained via an integration of existing hippocampus theories. Long-term low doses of drugs that reduce memory formation could prevent or delay dementia. TV-watching, videos, and some memory-enhancing nootropic drugs could increase risk.
