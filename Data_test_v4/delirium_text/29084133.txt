29084133|t|Modulation of the Senescence-Associated Inflammatory Phenotype in Human Fibroblasts by Olive Phenols.
29084133|a|Senescent cells display an increase in the secretion of growth factors, inflammatory cytokines and proteolytic enzymes, termed the "senescence-associated-secretory-phenotype" (SASP), playing a major role in many age-related diseases. The phenolic compounds present in extra-virgin olive oil are inhibitors of oxidative damage and have been reported to play a protective role in inflammation-related diseases. Particularly, hydroxytyrosol and oleuropein are the most abundant and more extensively studied. Pre-senescent human lung (MRC5) and neonatal human dermal (NHDF) fibroblasts were used as cellular model to evaluate the effect of chronic (4-6 weeks) treatment with 1 muM hydroxytyrosol (HT) or 10 muM oleuropein aglycone (OLE) on senescence/inflammation markers. Both phenols were effective in reducing beta-galactosidase-positive cell number and p16 protein expression. In addition, senescence/inflammation markers such as IL-6 and metalloprotease secretion, and Ciclooxigenase type 2 (COX-2) and alpha-smooth-actin levels were reduced by phenol treatments. In NHDF, COX-2 expression, Nuclear Factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NFkappaB) protein level and nuclear localization were augmented with culture senescence and decreased by OLE and HT treatment. Furthermore, the inflammatory effect of Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNFalpha) exposure was almost completely abolished in OLE- and HT-pre-treated NHDF. Thus, the modulation of the senescence-associated inflammatory phenotype might be an important mechanism underlying the beneficial effects of olive oil phenols.
