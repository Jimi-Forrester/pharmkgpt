37629392|t|Is Histamine and Not Acetylcholine the Missing Link between ADHD and Allergies? Speer Allergic Tension Fatigue Syndrome Re-Visited.
37629392|a|Speer allergic tension-fatigue syndrome (SATFS) is a classic allergy syndrome characterized by allergy-like symptoms, muscle tension, headaches, chronic fatigue, and other particular behaviors that were initially described in the fifties. The particular behaviors displayed include symptoms such as hyperkinesis, hyperesthesia (i.e., insomnia), restlessness, and distractibility, among others. Interestingly, these symptoms are very similar to descriptions of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), the most prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder worldwide, which is characterized by inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. The clinical description of SATFS precedes the nomination of ADHD in 1960 by Stella Chess. In this conceptual paper, we stress that there is a gap in the research on the relationship between ADHD and allergic pathologies. The hypotheses of this conceptual paper are (1) SATFS is probably one of the first and best historical descriptions of ADHD alongside a common comorbidity (allergy) displayed by these patients; (2) SATFS (ADHD) is a systemic disease that includes both somatic and behavioral manifestations that may influence each other in a bidirectional manner; (3) The role of neuroinflammation and histamine is key for understanding the pathophysiology of ADHD and its frequent somatic comorbidities; (4) The deficiency of the diamine oxidase (DAO) enzyme, which metabolizes histamine extracellularly, may play a role in the pathophysiology of ADHD. Decreased DAO activity may lead to an accumulation of histamine, which could contribute to core ADHD symptoms and comorbid disorders. Further empirical studies are needed to confirm our hypotheses.
