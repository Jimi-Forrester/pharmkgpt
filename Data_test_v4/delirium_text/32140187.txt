32140187|a|BACKGROUND: Ubiquitination is an important molecular event in lung squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC), which currently is mainly studied in nonsmall cell lung carcinoma cell models but lacking of ubiquitination studies on LSCC tissues. Here, we presented the ubiquitinated protein profiles of LSCC tissues to explore ubiquitination-involved molecular network alterations and identify abnormally ubiquitinated proteins as useful biomarkers for predictive, preventive, and personalized medicine (PPPM) in LSCC. METHODS: Anti-ubiquitin antibody-based enrichment coupled with LC-MS/MS was used to identify differentially ubiquitinated proteins (DUPs) between LSCC and control tissues, followed by integrative omics analyses to identify abnormally ubiquitinated protein biomarkers for LSCC. RESULTS: Totally, 400 DUPs with 654 ubiquitination sites were identified,, and motifs A-X (1/2/3)-K* were prone to be ubiquitinated in LSCC tissues. Those DUPs were involved in multiple molecular network systems, including the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), cell metabolism, cell adhesion, and signal transduction. Totally, 44 hub molecules were revealed by protein-protein interaction network analysis, followed by survival analysis in TCGA database (494 LSCC patients and 20,530 genes) to obtain 18 prognosis-related mRNAs, of which the highly expressed mRNAs VIM and IGF1R were correlated with poorer prognosis, while the highly expressed mRNA ABCC1 was correlated with better prognosis. VIM-encoded protein vimentin and ABCC1-encoded protein MRP1 were increased in LSCC, which were all associated with poor prognosis. Proteasome-inhibited experiments demonstrated that vimentin and MRP1 were degraded through UPS. Quantitative ubiquitinomics found ubiquitination level was decreased in vimentin and increased in MRP1 in LSCC. These findings showed that the increased vimentin in LSCC might be derived from its decreased ubiquitination level and that the increased MRP1 in LSCC might be derived from its protein synthesis > degradation. GSEA and co-expression gene analyses revealed that VIM and MRP1 were involved in multiple crucial biological processes and pathways. Further, TRIM2 and NEDD4L were predicted as E3 ligases to regulate ubiquitination of vimentin and MRP1, respectively. CONCLUSION: These findings revealed ubiquitinomic variations and molecular network alterations in LSCC, which is in combination with multiomics analysis to identify ubiquitination-related biomarkers for in-depth insight into the molecular mechanism and therapeutic targets and for prediction, diagnosis, and prognostic assessment of LSCC.
