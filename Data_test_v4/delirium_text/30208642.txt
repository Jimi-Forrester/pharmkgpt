30208642|t|Identification of Antiglycative Compounds in Japanese Red Water Pepper (Red Leaf Variant of the Persicaria hydropiper Sprout).
30208642|a|Glycation, the nonenzymatic reaction between proteins and excess blood sugar, is implicated in multiple disorders and occurs via the formation and accumulation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs). In our previous studies, we demonstrated that the red-leaf variant of the Persicaria hydropiper sprout (Japanese red water pepper, Benitade) is one of the potent plants that inhibit formation of AGEs. In this study, we aimed to identify antiglycative compounds in Benitade. Benitade extracts were prepared with hot water, then fractionated by using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The antiglycative efficacy of each fraction was evaluated by measuring the formation of fluorescent AGEs (Ex 370 nm/Em 440 nm). Two fractions, which contained peaks at 26.4 min and 31.8 min, showed potent antiglycative efficacy. When we hydrolyzed these peaks, they shifted to 32.5 and 41.4 min, which are the same retention times as cyanidin and quercetin, respectively. Based on thin-layer chromatography, both compounds contained galactose. Finally, ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole-time of flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QqTOF-MS) analyses were performed to determine the structure of those compounds. Overall, we identified two glycosides, cyanidin 3-O-galactoside (idaein) and quercetin 3-O-galactoside (hyperin), as representative antiglycative compounds in Benitade.
