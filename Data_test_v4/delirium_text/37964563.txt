37964563|t|Association of acute kidney injury with the risk of cognitive impairment or dementia: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
37964563|a|PURPOSE: Since previous studies have shown a paradoxical relationship between acute kidney injury (AKI) and risk of cognitive impairment, there is an urgent need for a meta-analysis to assess the relationship between AKI and risk of cognitive impairment or dementia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From database inception to October 2023, we searched PubMed, OVID (Medline), Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library. This study examined AKI and cognitive impairment or dementia observational studies. Two authors independently assessed cohort and cross-sectional study quality using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and AHRQ Scale. They also used ROBINS-I to assess bias. The meta-analysis used fixed effects. Sensitivity analysis verified results stability. The funnel plot, Egger test, and Begg test determined publication bias in the results. RESULTS: Seven studies with 423,876 patients were included in the meta-analysis. Patients with AKI were at higher risk of cognitive impairment or dementia compared to those who had not experienced AKI (OR = 1.87, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.77-1.98, I2=46.0%, p = 0.08). All subgroups showed a substantial connection between AKI and cognitive impairment. Compared to domestic research, the connection was stronger in overseas studies (OR = 2.18, 95% CI: 1.66-2.87). Both cognitive impairment and dementia outcomes showed a substantial connection between AKI and cognitive impairment, with OR values of 2.00 (95% CI: 1.44-2.76) and 2.04 (95% CI: 1.66-2.51). CONCLUSIONS: We found that AKI significantly increases cognitive impairment or dementia risk. Thus, early interventions to delay cognitive impairment and prevent adverse outcomes in AKI patients are needed.
