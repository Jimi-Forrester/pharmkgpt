35050089|t|Impact of Storage Controlled Atmosphere on the Apple Phenolic Acids, Flavonoids, and Anthocyanins and Antioxidant Activity In Vitro.
35050089|a|Apples are seasonal fruits, and it is important to prepare them adequately for storage and ensure proper storage conditions. In this study, we used ten different apple cultivars: 'Alva', 'Auksis', 'Connell Red', 'Cortland', 'Ligol', 'Lodel', 'Noris', 'Rubin', 'Sampion', and 'Spartan'. We studied the qualitative and quantitative composition of phenolic compounds in the apple and apple extracts antioxidants activity before placing them in the controlled atmosphere chambers and again at the end of the experiment, eight months later. Different concentrations of O2, CO2, and N2, constant temperature, relative humidity, and removal of endogenous ethylene were continually maintained. HPLC analysis showed that the highest amount of 2265.7 +- 152.5 microg/g of chlorogenic acid was found in apple samples of the 'Auksis' cultivar stored under variant IV conditions. Different concentrations of gas in the controlled atmosphere chambers caused changes in antioxidant activity in whole apple and apple peel extracts. In our study, we found that the antioxidant activity of apple extracts varied between samples of different apple cultivars and depended on the composition of the controlled atmosphere. Determining the optimal storage conditions is beneficial to providing the consumers with apples that have a known and minimally altered chemical composition of phenolic compounds and the strongest antioxidant activity, which determine the use of apples in the healthy food chain.
