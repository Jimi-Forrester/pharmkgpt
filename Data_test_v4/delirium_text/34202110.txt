34202110|t|The Current Role of Dexmedetomidine as Neuroprotective Agent: An Updated Review.
34202110|a|Dexmedetomidine, selective alpha2-adrenergic agonist dexmedetomidine, has been widely used clinically for sedation and anesthesia. The role of dexmedetomidine has been an interesting topic of neonatological and anesthetic research since a series of advantages of dexmedetomidine, such as enhancing recovery from surgery, reducing opioid prescription, decreasing sympathetic tone, inhibiting inflammatory reactions, and protecting organs, were reported. Particularly, an increasing number of animal studies have demonstrated that dexmedetomidine ameliorates the neurological outcomes associated with various brain and spinal cord injuries. In addition, a growing number of clinical trials have reported the efficacy of dexmedetomidine for decreasing the rates of postoperative neurological dysfunction, such as delirium and stroke, which strongly highlights the possibility of dexmedetomidine functioning as a neuroprotective agent for future clinical use. Mechanism studies have linked dexmedetomidine's neuroprotective properties with its modulation of neuroinflammation, apoptosis, oxidative stress, and synaptic plasticity via the alpha2-adrenergic receptor, dependently or independently. By reviewing recent advances and preclinical and clinical evidence on the neuroprotective effects of dexmedetomidine, we hope to provide a complete understanding of the above mechanism and provide insights into the potential efficacy of this agent in clinical use for patients.
