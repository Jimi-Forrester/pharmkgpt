36077787|t|T-Cell-Based Cellular Immunotherapy of Multiple Myeloma: Current Developments.
36077787|a|T-cell-based cellular therapy was first approved in lymphoid malignancies (B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and large B-cell lymphoma) and expanding its investigation and application both in hematological and non-hematological malignancies. Two anti-BCMA (B cell maturation antigen) CAR (Chimeric Antigen Receptor) T-cell therapies have been recently approved for relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma with excellent efficacy even in the heavily pre-treated patient population. This new therapeutic approach significantly changes our practice; however, there is still room for further investigation to optimize antigen receptor engineering, cell harvest/selection, treatment sequence, etc. They are also associated with unique adverse events, especially CRS (cytokine release syndrome) and ICANS (immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome), which are not seen with other anti-myeloma therapies and require expertise for management and prevention. Other T-cell based therapies such as TCR (T Cell Receptor) engineered T-cells and non-genetically engineered adoptive T-cell transfers (Vgamma9 Vdelta2 T-cells and Marrow infiltrating lymphocytes) are also actively studied and worth attention. They can potentially overcome therapeutic challenges after the failure of CAR T-cell therapy through different mechanisms of action. This review aims to provide readers clinical data of T-cell-based therapies for multiple myeloma, management of unique toxicities and ongoing investigation in both clinical and pre-clinical settings.
