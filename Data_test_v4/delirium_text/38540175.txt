38540175|t|At the Intersection of Critical Care and Infectious Diseases: The Year in Review.
38540175|a|Severe infection represents a leading reason for admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) while nosocomial infection can arise as a complication of care in the ICU. The mortality and morbidity of such infections are substantial. These processes also put economic strain on the healthcare system. Additionally, the continued spread of antimicrobial resistance has made it more challenging both to prevent and treat severe infection. Until recently, there were few well-done trials addressing infection among the critically ill. However, over the last year, six important randomized studies have dealt with a range of topics at the intersection of infectious diseases and critical care. Our goal is to review these reports in order to clarify their major findings, significance, strengths, weaknesses, and clinical applications. Specifically, we explore and discuss six trials conducted in the areas of (1) prevention, (2) the present use of standard antimicrobials, and (3) novel adjunctive and antibiotic treatments. Through highlighting these trials, we hope to help clinicians apply their important findings in an evidence-based fashion at the bedside. It is through the application of key evidence that both infectious disease practitioners and intensivists can improve patient outcomes.
