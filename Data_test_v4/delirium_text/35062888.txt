35062888|a|BACKGROUND: The kidney is the main site for the removal of chromogranin A (CgA). Previous studies have found that patients with renal impairment displayed elevated concentrations of CgA in plasma and that CgA concentrations reflect a deterioration of renal function. In this study, we aimed to estimate serum CgA levels and to evaluate the role of serum CgA in the early diagnosis of diabetic nephropathy (DN). METHODS: A total of 219 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) were included in this cross-sectional study. These patients were classified into normoalbuminuria (n = 121), microalbuminuria (n = 73), or macroalbuminuria (n = 25) groups based on their urine albumin to creatinine ratios (UACRs). The degree of DN is reflected by UACR. A control group consisted of 45 healthy subjects. The serum CgA levels were measured by ELISA, and other key parameters were assayed. RESULTS: Serum CgA levels were higher in patients with T2DM than in control subjects, and a statistically significant difference among the studied subgroups regarding CgA was found (P < 0.05). The levels of serum CgA increased gradually with the degree of DN (P < 0.001). Serum CgA levels showed a moderate-intensity positive correlation with UACRs (P < 0.001). A cutoff level of 3.46 ng/ml CgA showed 69.86% sensitivity and 66.12% specificity to detect DN in the early stage. CONCLUSION: The levels of serum CgA increased gradually with the degree of DN and can be used as a biomarker in the early detection of DN.
