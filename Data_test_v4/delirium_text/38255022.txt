38255022|t|Caregiver Experiences with Dementia-Related Feeding/Eating Difficulties.
38255022|a|This cross-sectional study explores caregivers' perceptions of feeding/eating difficulties in persons living with dementia, their support provisions, and the associated burdens. Cognitive decline, behavioral symptoms, and physical issues contribute to the deterioration of feeding/eating activities in people with dementia. Inadequate support during mealtimes has adverse consequences. This study includes 31 caregivers who completed an online questionnaire with three sections: sociodemographic information, feeding/eating problems and required support for individuals with dementia, and caregiver burden and distress. The questions on feeding and eating problems were adapted from the Appetite and Eating Habits Questionnaire (APEHQ). The results show that nearly all persons living with dementia had symptoms of feeding/eating problems, requiring caregiver support, ranging from verbal assistance to full physical assistance. The caregivers reported high distress, which was positively correlated with dementia severity. The findings emphasize the importance of raising caregiver awareness about dementia's impact on eating behavior, identifying effective mealtime care strategies, meeting nutritional needs, and emphasizing personal self-care. This research provides insights for healthcare professionals to develop targeted interventions, alleviate caregiver burden, improve mealtime experiences, and ensure adequate nutrition for persons living with dementia.
