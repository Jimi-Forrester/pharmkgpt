37108814|t|Improving the Treatment Effect of Carotenoids on Alzheimer's Disease through Various Nano-Delivery Systems.
37108814|a|Natural bioactive compounds have recently emerged as a current strategy for Alzheimer's disease treatment. Carotenoids, including astaxanthin, lycopene, lutein, fucoxanthin, crocin and others are natural pigments and antioxidants, and can be used to treat a variety of diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. However, carotenoids, as oil-soluble substances with additional unsaturated groups, suffer from low solubility, poor stability and poor bioavailability. Therefore, the preparation of various nano-drug delivery systems from carotenoids is a current measure to achieve efficient application of carotenoids. Different carotenoid delivery systems can improve the solubility, stability, permeability and bioavailability of carotenoids to a certain extent to achieve Alzheimer's disease efficacy. This review summarizes recent data on different carotenoid nano-drug delivery systems for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, including polymer, lipid, inorganic and hybrid nano-drug delivery systems. These drug delivery systems have been shown to have a beneficial therapeutic effect on Alzheimer's disease to a certain extent.
