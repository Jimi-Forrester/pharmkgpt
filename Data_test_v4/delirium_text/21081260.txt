21081260|a|OBJECTIVE: To prospectively investigate variations in prevalences of mental disorders after burn, and correlation between burn severity and mental disorders among hospitalized burn patients. METHOD: A cohort of 107 consecutive acute adult burn patients was examined with structured diagnostic interview (SCID-I) at baseline, and 92 patients (86%) at 6 months after injury. Prevalences of mental disorders for the whole 6-month follow-up period, plus 1-month point prevalences in acute care and in a second 6-month interview were assessed, and the two point prevalences were compared. Burn severity was estimate by %TBSA. RESULTS: During the 6-month follow-up 55% (51/92) of burn patients had at least one mental disorder, including 12% (11/92) with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In a multinomial regression, %TBSA exposure independently and strongly predicted risk for mental disorders, especially for anxiety disorders and delirium. The overall point prevalence of mental disorders decreased significantly (p=0.036) from acute care (45%) to 6 months (33%). CONCLUSIONS: After burn, more than half of the patients suffer from some type of mental disorder, but the prevalence declines over time after the acute phase. The disorders are not limited to depression and PTSD. A strong relationship likely exists between burn severity and some post-burn mental disorders.
