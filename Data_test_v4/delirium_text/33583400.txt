33583400|a|BACKGROUND: Aim of this multicenter, observational, cross-sectional study was to evaluate health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and treatment satisfaction of current medications in Chinese knee OA patients. METHODS: Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (TSQM-1.4), and HRQoL (EQ-5D-5L) were assessed in total of 601 OA of knee patients. Impact on QoL (EQ-5D-5L) and treatment satisfaction (TSQM-1.4) by BPI-Severity score (< 4 and >= 4) were presented using mean standard deviations (SDs) and were compared using a t-test. For each of self-assessed health EQ-5D-5L and TSQM, a linear regression model was used to estimate the regression coefficient along with corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) for BPI-Severity. RESULTS: Mean score of EQ-5D-5L of patients with BPI-Severity >=4 was significantly lower than those with BPI-Severity < 4. All the scores of TSQM in 4 dimensions were lower in patients with BPI-Severity >=4 than in those with BPI-Severity < 4. Both HRQoL scores and TSQM scores showed a statistically significant decreasing trend with increasing BPI-Severity pain score. CONCLUSION: Chronic knee OA pain has a significant impact on patients' HRQoL. More severe patients with OA were less satisfied with current treatments.
