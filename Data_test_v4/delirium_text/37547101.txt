37547101|t|STRIDE: Systematic Radar Intelligence Analysis for ADRD Risk Evaluation with Gait Signature Simulation and Deep Learning.
37547101|a|Abnormal gait is a significant non-cognitive biomarker for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and AD-related dementia (ADRD). Micro-Doppler radar, a non-wearable technology, can capture human gait movements for potential early ADRD risk assessment. In this research, we propose to design STRIDE integrating micro-Doppler radar sensors with advanced artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. STRIDE embeds a new deep learning (DL) classification framework. As a proof of concept, we develop a "digital-twin" of STRIDE, consisting of a human walking simulation model and a micro-Doppler radar simulation model, to generate a gait signature dataset. Taking established human walking parameters, the walking model simulates individuals with ADRD under various conditions. The radar model based on electromagnetic scattering and the Doppler frequency shift model is employed to generate micro-Doppler signatures from different moving body parts (e.g., foot, limb, joint, torso, shoulder, etc.). A band-dependent DL framework is developed to predict ADRD risks. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of STRIDE for evaluating ADRD risk.
