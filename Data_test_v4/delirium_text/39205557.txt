39205557|t|Is Sphingosine Kinase 1 Associated with Hematological Malignancy? A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
39205557|a|BACKGROUND: Sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1) is a lipid enzyme whose role in the etiology of cancer has been well explored. Here, a systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to evaluate the association of SphK1 expression with hematological malignancy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Relevant studies were identified through electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and OVID) and evaluated based on predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Quality assessment using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) was conducted, and pooled odds ratio (OR) was calculated to assess the association between SphK1 expression and hematological malignancy. RESULTS: Nine studies meeting the inclusion criteria were included in the systematic review. These studies utilized various techniques to assess SphK1 expression in hematological malignancies. The quality assessment reported that the included studies were of moderate quality. Meta-analysis of eligible studies revealed a positive association between SphK1 expression and hematological malignancies at the protein level (OR = 52.37, 95% CI = 10.10 to 271.47, and P = 0.00001). The funnel plot indicated no publication bias among the included studies. However, the certainty of the evidence was low according to the GRADE assessment. CONCLUSION: Our study's findings support the link between SphK1 expression and hematological malignancies. SphK1 gene dysregulation may contribute to various malignancies, suggesting it could be a therapeutic target to improve patient outcomes. Further research is needed to understand SphK1's mechanistic role in hematological malignancies and its therapeutic potential.
