38071202|a|Accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in its earliest stage can prevent the disease and delay the symptoms. Therefore, more sensitive, non-invasive, and simple screening tools are required for the early diagnosis and monitoring of AD. Here, we design a self-assembled nanoparticle-mediated amplified fluorogenic immunoassay (SNAFIA) consisting of magnetic and fluorophore-loaded polymeric nanoparticles. Using a discovery cohort of 21 subjects, proteomic analysis identifies adenylyl cyclase-associated protein 1 (CAP1) as a potential tear biomarker. The SNAFIA demonstrates a low detection limit (236 aM), good reliability (R2 = 0.991), and a wide analytical range (0.320-1000 fM) for CAP1 in tear fluid. Crucially, in the verification phase with 39 subjects, SNAFIA discriminates AD patients from healthy controls with 90% sensitivity and 100% specificity in under an hour. Utilizing tear fluid as a liquid biopsy, SNAFIA could potentially aid in long-term care planning, improve clinical trial efficiency, and accelerate therapeutic development for AD.
