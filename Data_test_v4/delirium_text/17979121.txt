17979121|a|Do cerebrovascular and Alzheimer's disease (AD) lesions represent additive factors in the development of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) as a putative preclinical stage of AD? Here we tested the hypothesis that directionality of fronto-parietal functional coupling of electroencephalographic (EEG) rhythms is relatively preserved in amnesic MCI subjects in whom the cognitive decline is mainly explained by white-matter vascular load. Resting EEG was recorded in 40 healthy elderly (Nold) and 78 amnesic MCI. In the MCI subjects, white-matter vascular load was quantified based on magnetic resonance images (0-30 visual rating scale). EEG rhythms of interest were delta (2-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha1 (8-10.5 Hz), alpha2 (10.5-13 Hz), beta1 (13-20 Hz), and beta2 (20-30 Hz). Directionality of fronto-parietal functional coupling of EEG rhythms was estimated by directed transfer function software. As main results, (i) fronto-parietal functional coupling of EEG rhythms was higher in magnitude in the Nold than in the MCI subjects; (ii) more interestingly, that coupling was higher at theta, alpha1, alpha2, and beta1 in MCI V+ (high vascular load; N = 42; MMSE = 26) than in MCI V- group (low vascular load; N = 36; MMSE= 26.7). These results are interpreted as supporting the additive model according to which MCI state would result from the combination of cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative lesions.
