17028559|a|The diagnosis of degenerative dementias heavily relies on the identification of neuronal or glial inclusions. Tauopathy is probably the largest group including Alzheimer and Pick disease, mutation of the tau gene, progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, and argyrophilic grain disease. Lewy bodies, when numerous in the cerebral cortex, are usually associated with the cognitive deficit of Parkinson disease dementia or of dementia with Lewy bodies--both conditions being distinguished by clinical information. The inclusions of the dentate gyrus, only labeled by anti-ubiquitin antibodies, isolate a subgroup of fronto-temporal dementia (FTDu), sometimes familial and sometimes associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Mutations of the progranulin gene have been recently discovered among a significant proportion of these patients. Neuronal Intermediate Filament Inclusion Disease (NIFID) is a rare, apparently sporadic dementia, characterized by the presence of large inclusions in the cell body of many neurons. These inclusions react with antibodies directed against neurofilaments or against other intermediate filaments (such as alpha-internexin). The diagnostic value of some of these inclusions allowing the classification of the degenerative dementias has been discussed. The link between the inclusions and the pathogenetic mechanism is indeed probably variable. It should however be stressed that whenever their composition has been elucidated, the inclusions have given important clues to the pathogenesis of the disease in which they had been found.
