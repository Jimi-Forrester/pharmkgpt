38773569|a|The use of biomarker-led clinical trial designs has been transformative for investigating amyloid-targeting therapies for Alzheimer's disease (AD). The designs have ensured the correct selection of patients on these trials, supported target engagement and have been used to support claims of disease modification and clinical efficacy. Ultimately, this has recently led to approval of disease-modifying, amyloid-targeting therapies for AD; something that should be noted for clinical trials investigating tau-targeting therapies for AD. There is a clear overlap of the purpose of biomarker use at each stage of clinical development between amyloid-targeting and tau-targeting clinical trials. However, there are differences within the potential context of use and interpretation for some biomarkers in particular measurements of amyloid and utility of soluble, phosphorylated tau biomarkers. Given the complexities of tau in health and disease, it is paramount that therapies target disease-relevant tau and, in parallel, appropriate assays of target engagement are developed. Tau positron emission tomography, fluid biomarkers reflecting tau pathology and downstream measures of neurodegeneration will be important both for participant recruitment and for monitoring disease-modification in tau-targeting clinical trials. Bespoke design of biomarker strategies and interpretations for different modalities and tau-based targets should also be considered.
