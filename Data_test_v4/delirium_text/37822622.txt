37822622|t|Assessment of human health hazard associated with heavy metal accumulation in popular freshwater, coastal and marine fishes from south-west region, Bangladesh.
37822622|a|An analysis was conducted on both freshwater, coastal and marine fish species to evaluate the concentrations of heavy metals, with the aim of assessing their levels and examining the potential health risks for humans linked to the consumption of contaminated fish. This study estimate concentrations of Cr, Fe, Cu, As, Cd and Pb in 60 individuals belonging to 20 species (10 species for freshwater and another 10 for coastal and marine fishes) by using Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer. Metal concentrations of Cr, Fe, and Pb in freshwater fishes and Cr, Fe, As, and Pb in marine fishes were exceeded the maximum allowable concentration (MAC). The Estimated Daily Intake (EDI), Average Pollution Load Index (APLI), Target Hazard Quotient (THQ), Hazard Index (HI) and Target Cancer Risk (TCR) of heavy metals were determined for the assessment of human health risk. Ranking order of the values of EDI for freshwater fishes, coastal and marine fishes were Cd > Fe > Pb > Cr > Cu > As and Cd > Fe > Pb > Cr > As > Cu. Highest APLI value of 8.14 (Puntius ticto) that is seriously polluted and 3.003 observed in Otolichthoides pama in freshwater and marine fishes, respectively. THQPb and THQAs for all the fish species were exceed the safe limit (THQ>1) suggesting potential health risk to consumers. The hazard index for both the fish samples were exceeded the USEPA (United States Environmental Protection Agency) permitted risk level (HI > 1). The target carcinogenic risk value for Cr and As were crossed the USEPA standard limit (TCR> 1E-04), which denotes that continuous consumption of studied fishes may cause health risk to the consumers. On the other hand, sensitivity analysis of freshwater, coastal and marine fishes indicates that all the metal concentrations were responsible factor for health risk.
