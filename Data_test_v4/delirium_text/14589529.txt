14589529|t|Electrocortical mapping, MRI, and neuropsychological measures: evidence of Alzheimer's disease in the presence of vascular lesions.
14589529|a|We report here a case study of a 76-year-old woman with a high school education, whose presenting psychiatric symptomatology indicated dementia of unknown etiology. Neuropsychological test results were consistent with AD, but diagnosis was complicated by an MRI showing a large right hemisphere cortical infarct and scattered subcortical changes leading to a diagnosis of possible AD. Electrocortical mapping showed the right hemisphere infarct, and gave independent evidence suggestive of AD in the relatively intact left hemisphere. This case demonstrates the utility of multidimensional assessment as an aid to differential diagnosis.
