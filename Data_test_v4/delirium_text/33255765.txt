33255765|t|Preclinical In Vitro Assessment of Submicron-Scale Laser Surface Texturing on Ti6Al4V.
33255765|a|Loosening of orthodontic and orthopedic implants is a critical and common clinical problem. To minimize the numbers of revision surgeries due to peri-implant inflammation or insufficient osseointegration, developments of new implant manufacturing strategies are indicated. Ultrafast laser surface texturing is a promising contact-free technology to modify the physicochemical properties of surfaces toward an anti-infectious functionalization. This work aims to texture Ti6Al4V surfaces with ultraviolet (UV) and green (GR) radiation for the manufacturing of laser-induced periodic surface structures (LIPSS). The assessment of these surface modifications addresses key aspects of topography, morphology and chemical composition. Human primary mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSCs) were cultured on laser-textured and polished Ti6Al4V to characterize the surfaces in terms of their in vitro biocompatibility, cytotoxicity, and metal release. The outcomes of the in vitro experiment show the successful culture of hMSCs on textured Ti6Al4V surfaces developed within this work. Cells cultured on LIPSS surfaces were not compromised in terms of their viability if compared to polished surfaces. Yet, the hMSC culture on UV-LIPSS show significantly lower lactate dehydrogenase and titanium release into the supernatant compared to polished. Thus, the presented surface modification can be a promising approach for future applications in orthodontics and orthopedics.
