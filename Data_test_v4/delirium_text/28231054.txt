28231054|t|Alzheimer's disease as an inflammatory disease.
28231054|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative condition characterized by the formation of amyloid-beta plaques, aggregated and hyperphosphorylated tau protein, activated microglia and neuronal cell death, ultimately leading to progressive dementia. In this short review, we focus on neuroinflammation in AD. Specifically, we describe the participation of microglia, as well as other factors that may contribute to inflammation, in neurodegeneration.
