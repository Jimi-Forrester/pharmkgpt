26438898|a|This review addresses the current hypotheses of the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and methods of its pharmacological corrections. The following topics are reviewed: a role of ss-amyloid in the pathogenesis of AD, a role of tau-protein in the pathogenesis of AD, main hypotheses of the pathogenesis, the relationship between ss-amyloid and tau-protein, the dysfunction of synapses in AD, a neuroimmune hypothesis, treatment approaches.
