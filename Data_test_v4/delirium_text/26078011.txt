26078011|t|NO-donor thiacarbocyanines as multifunctional agents for Alzheimer's disease.
26078011|a|Some symmetrical and unsymmetrical thiacarbocyanines bearing NO-donor nitrooxy and furoxan moieties were synthesized and studied as candidate anti-Alzheimer's drugs. All products activated soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) in a dose-dependent manner, depending on the presence in their structures of NO-donor groups. None displayed toxicity when tested at concentrations below 10 muM on human brain microvascular endothelial cells (hCMEC/D3). Some products were capable of inhibiting amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) aggregation, with a potency in the low muM concentration range, and of inhibiting aggregation of human recombinant tau protein in amyloid fibrils when incubated with the protein at 1 muM concentration. Nitrooxy derivative 21 and furoxan derivative 22 were selected to investigate synaptic plasticity. Both products, tested at 2 muM concentration, counteracted the inhibition of long-term potentiation (LTP) induced by Abeta42 in hippocampal brain slices.
