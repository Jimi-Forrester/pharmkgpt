26794958|t|Structural elucidation and protective role of a polysaccharide from Sargassum fusiforme on ameliorating learning and memory deficiencies in mice.
26794958|a|A fucoidan, Sargassum fusiforme polysaccharide 65 (SFPS65) A, was isolated from a brown alga (S. fusiforme). SFPS65A had an estimated molecular weight of 90kDa and showed alphaD(20) -74.3288 (c 0.05, H2O). SFPS65A is composed of fucose, galactose, xylose, glucose, glucuronic acid, and mannose in the ratio of 19.23:9.58:6.64:1:6.52:2.57. The structural features of SFPS65A were investigated using composition analysis, methylation analysis, infrared spectrum, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and electrospray ionization quadruple time-of-flight tandem mass spectroscopy. Results showed that SFPS65A has a main chain composed of  3)-beta-l-Fucp-(1 3,4)-beta-l-Fucp-(1 3,4)-beta-l-Fucp-(1  and connected with  3,4)-alpha-d-GlcAp-(1 ,  4)-beta-d-Xylp-(1 ,  4)-alpha-d-Galp-(1 ,  3,6)-alpha-d-Manp-(1  alternately. The branches at O-3 of the fucosyl residue and O-3 of the hexosyl residues may include sulfate,  4)-beta-l-Fucp-(1 , beta-d-Xylp-(1 , and beta-d-Xylp-(1 . SFPS65A exhibited an activity on Alzheimer's disease in vivo in the pharmacological experiments by increasing the cognitive abilities of scopolamine-, ethanol-, and sodium nitrite-treated mice against memory deficits.
