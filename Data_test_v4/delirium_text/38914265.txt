38914265|t|The link between Alzheimer's disease and stroke: A detrimental synergism.
38914265|a|Being age-related disorders, both Alzheimer's disease (AD) and stroke share multiple risk factors, such as hypertension, smoking, diabetes, and apolipoprotein E (APOE) E4 genotype, and coexist in patients. Accumulation of amyloid-beta plaques and neurofibrillary tangled impair cognitive potential, leading to AD. Blocked blood flow in the neuronal tissues, causes neurodegeneration and cell death in stroke. AD is commonly characterized by cerebral amyloid angiopathy, which significantly elevates the risk of hemorrhagic stroke. Patients with AD and stroke have been both reported to exhibit greater cognitive impairment, followed by multiple pathophysiological mechanisms shared between the two. The manuscript aims to elucidate the relationship between AD and stroke, as well as the common pathways and risk factors while understanding the preventive therapies that might limit the negative impacts of this correlation, with diagnostic modalities and current AD treatments. The authors provide a comprehensive review of the link and aid the healthcare professionals to identify suitable targets and risk factors, that may retard cognitive decline and neurodegeneration in patients. However, more intricate research is required in this regard and an interdisciplinary approach that would target both the vascular and neurodegenerative factors would improve the quality of life in AD patients.
