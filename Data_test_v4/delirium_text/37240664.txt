37240664|t|Monitored Anesthesia Care Using Remimazolam and Ketamine Combination for Brief Gynecological Surgeries: A Report for Four Cases.
37240664|a|Remimazolam is a benzodiazepine with rapid onset and recovery time. Ketamine provides analgesia and sedation without compromising hemodynamics. Combining both agents may provide good anesthesia and analgesia with fewer complications. We report four cases of monitored anesthesia care with a combination of remimazolam and ketamine for brief gynecological surgeries. We applied 0.5 mg/kg bolus ketamine and infused patients with remimazolam at 6 mg/kg/h for induction and 1 mg/kg/h for maintenance. Then, 25 microg of fentanyl was administered for analgesia 4 min before the procedure, and additional fentanyl was administered as needed. Remimazolam was discontinued shortly after surgery. We conducted satisfactory monitored anesthesia care with a combination of remimazolam and ketamine in all four cases.
