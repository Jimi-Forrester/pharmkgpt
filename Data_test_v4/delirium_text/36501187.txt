36501187|t|The Spectrum of Pharmacological Actions of Syringetin and Its Natural Derivatives-A Summary Review.
36501187|a|Mono- and poly-O-methylated flavonols and their glycoside derivatives belong to the group of natural plant polyphenols with a wide spectrum of pharmacological activities. These compounds are known for their antioxidant, antimutagenic, hepatoprotective, antidiabetic, and antilipogenic properties. Additionally, they inhibit carcinogenesis and cancer development. Having in mind the multidirectional biological activity of methylated flavonols, we would like to support further study on their health-promoting activities; in this review we summarized the most recent reports on syringetin and some of its structural analogues: laricitrin, ayanin, and isorhamnetin. Natural sources and biological potential of these substances were described based on the latest research papers.
