38041090|a|BACKGROUND: Virtual clinical simulations and clinical case seminar become widely utilized to address these constraints and help nursing students acquire clinical competencies as the limitations on practicum opportunities have been intensified by the COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose of this study was to examine learning flow, self-efficacy and satisfaction in virtual clinical simulation and clinical case seminar among nursing students. METHODS: A descriptive cross-sectional study was used. Forty-two junior nursing students completed survey questionnaires after participating in computer-based virtual clinical simulation and clinical case seminar, which aimed at acquiring knowledge and care skills in geriatric nursing. RESULTS: Significant differences in two methods were found in learning flow which included challenge-skill balance (t = -2.24, p < .05) and action-awareness merge (t = -3.32, p < .01). There was no significant difference in learning self-efficacy (t=-1.52, p = .137) and learning satisfaction (t=-0.92, p = .365). CONCLUSIONS: When there's a mismatch between the perceived challenge and the students' skill levels, it can hinder the learning process. Therefore, instructors should evaluate the clinical skill levels of their students and make necessary adjustments to the difficulty levels of simulation and clinical case seminar accordingly.
