37226524|a|BACKGROUND: Suicide is a serious public health problem. AIMS: To investigate the sociodemographic and clinical features of callers (patients) classed by the Qatar National Mental Health Helpline (NMHH) as moderate to high priority based on the risk of self-harm or suicide during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: The study design was a retrospective chart review of patients who contacted the helpline in the first 12 months, starting 1 April 2020. Data of those classed as moderate to high priority based on risk to self were collected using a specifically designed form. Absolute and relative frequencies for each of the studied categorical variables were determined. RESULTS: Four hundred and ninety-eight patients were included. More than half were female. The mean age was 32 years (range 8-85 years). Two-thirds of patients were from Arab countries and more than half of all patients had contacted mental health services for the first time. The most common symptoms elicited included suicidal thoughts, depressed mood and disturbed sleep. The most common psychiatric disorders were depression and generalised anxiety disorder. Most patients were seen within 4 h and received psychiatric interventions. Virtually all patients received non-pharmacological interventions; only 38.5% received pharmacological interventions. The majority had follow-up appointments arranged with mental health services. CONCLUSIONS: People from the Indian subcontinent and males proportionally approached services less, which may reflect stigma. The NMHH improved access to care for patients considered at risk to self and prevented hospital admissions. The NMHH offers a valuable additional choice to patients and assists in prevention and management of suicidal behaviour and other mental health difficulties.
