11578768|a|Microglia are widely held to play important pathophysiologic roles in Alzheimer's disease (AD). On exposure to amyloid beta peptide (A beta) they exhibit chemotactic, phagocytic, phenotypic and secretory responses consistent with scavenger cell activity in a localized inflammatory setting. Because AD microglial chemotaxis, phagocytosis, and secretory activity have common, tightly linked soluble intermediaries (e.g., cytokines, chemokines), cell surface intermediaries (e.g., receptors, opsonins), and stimuli (e.g., highly inert A beta deposits and exposed neurofibrilly tangles), the mechanisms for microglial clearance of A beta are necessarily coupled to localized inflammatory mechanisms that can be cytotoxic to nearby tissue. This presents a critical dilemma for strategies to remove A beta by enhancing micoglial activation--a dilemma that warrants substantial further investigation.
