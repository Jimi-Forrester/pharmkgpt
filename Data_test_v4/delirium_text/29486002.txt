29486002|t|Validation of the Spanish version of the Edinburgh Feeding Evaluation in Dementia Scale for older people with dementia.
29486002|a|AIMS: To adapt the Edinburgh Feeding Evaluation in Dementia Scale (EdFED) for use in a Spanish-speaking population and to assess its validity and reliability in patients with dementia. METHOD: A cross-sectional study was carried out in two stages: 1. Cross-cultural adaptation (translation, back-translation, review by committee of experts, pilot test and weighting of results); 2. Clinimetric validation comprising interobserver reliability assessment, test-retest reliability and internal consistency. To determine construct validity, confirmatory factorial analysis and principal components analysis were performed by oblique rotations. Criteria validity was analysed using the Pearson correlation (p<0.05) with the BMI, MNA and analytical values of albumin, transferrin, cholesterol, absolute lymphocytes and total proteins. Data collection was carried out for six months in 2016 in nursing homes and Alzheimer's day centers in the province of Malaga (Spain), at nine centers, with 262 patients (aged over 60 years and presenting feeding difficulties), 20 nurses, 20 professional caregivers and 103 family caregivers. RESULTS: A version of EdFED culturally adapted to Spanish was obtained. The sample presented the following characteristics: 76.3% women, mean age 82.3 years (SD: 7.9); MNA 18.73 (SD: 4.44); BMI 23.99 (SD: 4.72); serum albumin 3.79 mg/dl (SD: 0.36). A Cronbach's alpha of 0.88 was obtained, with an inter-item global correlation of 0.43 and a homogeneity index ranging from 0.42 to 0.73. The exploratory factor analysis reproduced the three-factor model identified by the original authors, explaining 62.32% of the total variance. The criterion validity showed a good inverse correlation with MNA and a moderate one with albumin, total proteins, transferrin and BMI. DISCUSSION: The Spanish version of EdFED is reliable and valid for use in elderly people with dementia. The most appropriate for our environment is the three-factor model, which maintains the original factors, with a slight redistribution of the items.
