30700814|t|Network Analysis Reveals TNF as a Major Hub of Reactive Inflammation Following Spinal Cord Injury.
30700814|a|Spinal cord injury (SCI) leads to reactive inflammation and other harmful events that limit spinal cord regeneration. We propose an approach for studying the mechanisms at the levels of network topology, gene ontology, signaling pathways, and disease inference. We treated inflammatory mediators as toxic chemicals and retrieved the genes and interacting proteins associated with them via a set of biological medical databases and software. We identified >10,000 genes associated with SCI. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) had the highest scores, and the top 30 were adopted as core data. In the core interacting protein network, TNF and other top 10 nodes were the major hubs. The core members were involved in cellular responses and metabolic processes, as components of the extracellular space and regions, in protein-binding and receptor-binding functions, as well as in the TNF signaling pathway. In addition, both seizures and SCI were highly associated with TNF levels; therefore, for achieving a better curative effect on SCI, TNF and other major hubs should be targeted together according to the theory of network intervention, rather than a single target such as TNF alone. Furthermore, certain drugs used to treat epilepsy could be used to treat SCI as adjuvants.
