30096650|a|The multifactorial nature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) calls for the development of multitarget agents addressing key pathogenic processes. A novel family of donepezil-butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) hybrids were designed, synthesized and evaluated as multifunctional ligands against AD. The optimal compound 7d displayed a balanced multifunctional profile covering an intriguing acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition (IC50, 0.075 muM for eeAChE and 0.75 muM for hAChE) and Monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) inhibition (IC50, 7.4 muM for hMAO-B), excellent antioxidant activity (71.7 muM of IC50 by DPPH method, 0.82 and 1.62 trolox equivalent by ABTS method and ORAC method respectively), and inhibitory effects on self-induced, hAChE-induced Abeta aggregation. Moreover, 7d possessed neuroprotective potency against H2O2-induced oxidative damage on PC12 cells and Lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-stimulated inflammation on BV2 cells. Compound 7d was capable of penetrating BBB and presented good liver microsomal metabolic stability. Importantly, compound 7d could dose-dependently reverse scopolamine-induced memory deficit in mice without acute toxicity. Taken together, those outstanding results highlight the donepezil-BHT hybrid 7d as a promising prototype in the research of innovative compound for AD.
