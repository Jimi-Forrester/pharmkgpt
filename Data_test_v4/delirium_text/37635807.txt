37635807|a|Objectives: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most widespread and highly heritable neurodevelopmental disorders affecting children worldwide. Although synaptosomal-associated protein 25 (SNAP-25) is a possible gene hypothesized to be associated with working memory deficits in ADHD, little is known about its specific impact on the hippocampus. The goal of the current study was to determine how variations in ADHD's SNAP-25 Mnll polymorphism (rs3746544) affect hippocampal functional connectivity (FC). Methods: A total of 88 boys between the ages of 7 and 10 years were recruited for the study, including 60 patients with ADHD and 28 healthy controls (HCs). Data from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and clinical information were acquired and assessed. Two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in the SNAP-25 gene were genotyped, according to which the study's findings separated ADHD patients into two groups: TT homozygotes (TT = 35) and G-allele carriers (TG = 25). Results: Based on the rs-fMRI data, the FC of the right hippocampus and left frontal gyrus was evaluated using group-based comparisons. The corresponding sensitivities and specificities were assessed. Following comparisons between the patient groups, different hippocampal FCs were identified. When compared to TT patients, children with TG had a lower FC between the right precuneus and the right hippocampus, and a higher FC between the right hippocampus and the left middle frontal gyrus. Conclusion: The fundamental neurological pathways connecting the SNAP-25 Mnll polymorphism with ADHD via the FC of the hippocampus were newly revealed in this study. As a result, the hippocampal FC may further serve as an imaging biomarker for ADHD.
