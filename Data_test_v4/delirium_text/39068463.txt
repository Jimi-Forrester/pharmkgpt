39068463|t|2-Bromo-1,4-Naphthalenedione promotes CD8+ T cell expansion and limits Th1/Th17 to mitigate experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.
39068463|a|Treating Multiple sclerosis (MS), a well-known immune-mediated disease characterized by axonal demyelination, is challenging due to its complex causes. Naphthalenedione, present in numerous plants, is being explored as a potential medicine for MS due to its immunomodulatory properties. However, its effects on lymphocytes can vary depending on factors such as the specific compound, concentration, and experimental conditions. In this study, we aim to explore the therapeutic potential of 2-bromo-1,4-naphthalenedione (BrQ), a derivative of naphthalenedione, in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of MS, and to elucidate its underlying mechanisms. We observed that mice treated with BrQ exhibited reduced severity of EAE symptoms, including lower clinical scores, decreased leukocyte infiltration, and less extensive demyelination in central nervous system. Furthermore, it was noted that BrQ does not directly affect the remyelination process. Through cell-chat analysis based on bulk RNA-seq data, coupled with validation of flow analysis, we discovered that BrQ significantly promotes the expansion of CD8+ T cells and their interactions with other immune cells in peripheral immune system in EAE mice. Subsequent CD8+ T cell depletion experiments confirmed that BrQ alleviates EAE in a CD8+ T cell-dependent manner. Mechanistically, expanded CD8+ cells were found to selectively reduce antigen-specific CD4+ cells and subsequently inhibit Th1 and Th17 cell development in vivo, ultimately leading to relief from EAE. In summary, our findings highlight the crucial role of BrQ in modulating the pathogenesis of MS, suggesting its potential as a novel drug candidate for treating MS and other autoimmune diseases.
