31687113|t|Anesthesia Related Complications of Gastrointestinal Endoscopies; A Retrospective Descriptive Study.
31687113|a|BACKGROUND Gastrointestinal endoscopic procedures are widely used for diagnostic and therapeutic measures. Analgesia and sedation/anesthesia are inseparable parts of these studies and their related complications are inevitable. METHODS In a retrograde descriptive study in Shahid Beheshti Hospital, affiliated to Qom University of Medical Sciences, Qom, Iran from March 2013 to March 2017, we gathered information regarding common anesthesia related complications and analyzed them. RESULTS 44659 procedures were performed during the study period and records of 21342 men (47.79%) and 23317 women (52.21%) were evaluated. Hemodynamic instability (9998; 22.39%), dysrhythmia (1600; 3.58%), desaturation (608; 1.36%), prolonged apnea (34; 0.08%), aspiration (43; 0.10%), postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) (636; 1.42%), headache (106; 0.24%), delirium (51; 0.11%), aphasia (1; 0.00%), masseter muscle spasm (1; 0.01%), myocardial infarction (2; 0.00%), and death (5; 0.01%) were seen in the patients. CONCLUSION Sedation/anesthesia is enough safe in gastrointestinal endoscopic procedures to enhance the patients' satisfaction and cooperation. If anesthesia with spontaneous breathing and unsecure airway is selected for this purpose, vigilance of anesthesia provider will be the key element of uneventful and safe procedure.
