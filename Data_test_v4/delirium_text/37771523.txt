37771523|t|A Systematic Review on Outcomes of Patients with Heatstroke and Heat Exhaustion.
37771523|a|Introduction: Heatstroke (HS) is a severe form of heat-related illness (HRI) associated with high morbidity and mortality, representing a condition that includes long-term multiorgan dysfunction and susceptibility to further heat illness. Methods: In a systematic review searching Medline PubMed from the studies conducted between 2009 and 2020, 16 papers were identified. Results: A hallmark symptom of heat stroke is CNS dysfunction (a hallmark sign of HS) which manifests as mental status changes, including agitation, delirium, epilepsy, or coma at the time of the collapse. Acute kidney injury (AKI), gut ischemia, blood clots in the stomach and small intestine, cytoplasmic protein clumps in the spleen, and injury of skeletal muscle (rhabdomyolysis) are all characteristics of peripheral tissue damage. Severe heat stroke tends to be complicated by rhabdomyolysis, especially in patients with exertional heat stroke. Rhabdomyolysis may lead to systemic effects, including the local occurrence of compartment syndrome, hyperkalemic cardiac arrest, and/or lethal disseminated intravascular coagulopathy. Untreated heat stroke might exacerbate psychosis, lactic acidosis, consumptive coagulopathy, hematuria, pulmonary edema, renal failure, and other metabolic abnormalities. Core body temperature and level of consciousness are the most significant indicators to diagnose the severity of heat stroke and prevent unfavorable consequences. Heatstroke is a life-threatening illness if not promptly recognized and effectively treated. Discussion: This review highlighted that core body temperature and white blood cell count are significant contributing factors affecting heat stroke outcomes. Other factors contributing to the poor outcome include old age, low GCS, and prolonged hospital stay. The prevalence of both classic and exertional heatstroke can be reduced by certain simple preventive measures, such as avoiding strenuous activity in hot environments and reducing exposure to heat stress.
