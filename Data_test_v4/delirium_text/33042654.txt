33042654|t|A Randomised Controlled Trial of Local Infiltration Analgesia Versus Femoral Nerve Block for Postoperative Analgesia Following Total Knee Arthroplasty.
33042654|a|Background Total knee replacement is often associated with significant postoperative pain. Although the use of a femoral nerve block is well-established, local infiltration analgesia has gained popularity in recent years. We compared single-shot local infiltration analgesia with a single-shot femoral nerve block for patients undergoing primary total knee arthroplasty. Methods A total of 194 patients were randomised to receive either local infiltration analgesia (150 ml bupivacaine 0.067% with adrenaline) or a femoral nerve block (20 ml 0.375% levobupivacaine). Both groups received spinal anaesthesia. The primary outcome measure was the total morphine consumption. Secondary outcome measures included: post-operative pain scores, rehabilitation goals, readiness for discharge, and physical, mental, and functional outcomes, including the Oxford Knee Score (OKS). Results A total of 69 patients in the local infiltration analgesia group and 79 patients in the femoral nerve block group were analysed. Median total morphine consumption was significantly greater in the local infiltration analgesia group as compared to the femoral nerve block group (54.67 mg vs 45 mg, respectively, p=0.0388). The post-operative OKS at six weeks was slightly more improved for the femoral nerve block group than for local infiltration analgesia (12.5 vs 9 point median improvements for the femoral nerve block and local infiltration analgesia groups, respectively, p=0.0261). There were no statistically significant differences in other secondary outcome measures. Conclusion A single-shot femoral nerve block significantly reduces the opioid requirement for primary total knee arthroplasty but is otherwise comparable to single-shot local infiltration analgesia.
