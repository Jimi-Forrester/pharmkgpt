33628775|t|The Effects of Copper Constituent of Coin Currency on Embryonic Zebrafish Development.
33628775|a|Copper has demonstrated utility in multiple industrial applications for its high conductivity and antibacterial/antiviral properties. However, numerous findings have suggested potential hazards regarding pathogenesis. This study was conducted to demonstrate the application of zebrafish (Danio rerio) as a cost-effective biological assay to detect environmental pollution, i.e., heavy metal of coins. We demonstrated that zebrafish larvae exposed to copper-plated coins or copper (II) ion solution elicited a consistent phenotype of early mortality without signs of morphological defects in surviving individuals. Copper ion solution served as a standard to (1) corroborate copper exposure from coins and (2) demonstrate proportional increase in early mortality phenotype according to concentration. We found that 5 muM CuSO4 5H2O was the minimal concentration to elicit the observed phenotypes from copper toxicity. This study aimed to demonstrate how a simple protocol involving wild-type zebrafish larvae could provide an economical solution to water monitoring in areas of rapid technological advancement and increasing environmental concerns, especially in communities without access to expensive analytical methods.
