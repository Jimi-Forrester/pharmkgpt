34946609|t|Retrieval of High Added Value Natural Bioactive Coumarins from Mandarin Juice-Making Industrial Byproduct.
34946609|a|Cold pressed essential oil (CPEO) of mandarin (Citrus reticulata Blanco), a by-product of the juice-making industrial process known to contain large amounts of polymethoxyflavones, was exploited for its content in high added value natural coumarins. The study herein afforded a method referring to the evaporation of CPEO volatile fraction under mild conditions (reduced pressure and temperature below 35  C) as azeotrope with isopropanol. This allowed the isolation of high added value coumarins from the non-volatile fragment using preparative High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). Pilot-scale application of this procedure afforded for each kg of CPEO processed the following natural bioactive coumarins in chemically pure forms: heraclenol (38-55 mg), 8-gerayloxypsoralen (35-51 mg), auraptene (22-33 mg), and bergamottin (14-19 mg). The structures of coumarins were verified by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and HPLC co-injection with authentic standards. Thus, the low market value mandarin CPEO with current value of 17 to 22 EUR/kg can be valorized through the production of four highly bioactive natural compounds worth 3479 to 5057 EUR/kg, indicating the great potentials of this methodology in the terms of the circular economy.
