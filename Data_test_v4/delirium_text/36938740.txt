36938740|t|Postmortem Cerebellar Volume Is Not Reduced in Essential Tremor: A Comparison with Multiple System Atrophy and Controls.
36938740|a|BACKGROUND: Essential tremor (ET) is a common movement disorder in which cerebellar microscopic and volume alterations have been repeatedly reported although with disagreement between studies. However, pronounced heterogeneity was found with regard to cerebellar volume alterations. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess postmortem cerebellar volume in subjects with or without ET, as compared with subjects with multiple system atrophy (MSA), a well-established cerebellar neurodegeneration. METHODS: Cases with ET (n = 29), MSA (n = 7), and non-demented control cases without any movement disorder (n = 22) were selected from the Arizona Study of Aging and Neurodegenerative Disorders (AZSAND), a longitudinal clinicopathological study with annual research-dedicated clinical assessments by neuropsychologists, subspecialist movement disorders, and cognitive/behavioral neurologists, with comprehensive neuropathological examinations after death. Group comparisons were controlled for common age-related neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular pathologies. Cerebellar volumes were calculated using digital images of slices taken at the time of autopsy, immediately after brain removal and before fixation. RESULTS: Cerebellar volume was not reduced in ET subjects compared to controls. The two groups did not differ in terms of incidental cerebrovascular and Alzheimer's disease neuropathology. In contrast, cerebellar volume was significantly reduced in subjects with MSA when compared to ET and control subjects. CONCLUSION: In a well-characterized cohort, postmortem cerebellar volume measurements suggest that there are no volume alterations in ET when compared to controls, in contrast to significant cerebellar atrophy in subjects with MSA.
