16522131|t|Delirium concisely: condition is associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and length of hospitalization.
16522131|a|Delirium is a common neuropsychiatric condition that affects 15% to 70% of elderly medical and surgical patients. It tends to be a transient disorder, although long-term complications are not uncommon. Medical comorbidity is the rule, and predisposing, as well as precipitating, factors are important to consider in its management. Major risk factors for delirium include advanced age, cognitive impairment, and chronic medical illness. Delirium is associated with several adverse outcomes including mortality, increased length of hospital stay, increased risk of dementia, and high rates of institutional placement. Delirium is distressing for patients, families, and staff. Nonpharmacologic-integrated intervention programs may improve outcome and may be incorporated into the overall medical management.
