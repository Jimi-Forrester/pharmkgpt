15832033|t|Evaluating associations between 5-HTTLPR polymorphism and Alzheimer's disease for Korean patients.
15832033|a|There has been growing evidence that the serotonin (5-HT) system is important in the regulation of memory and thus might be associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD), while research results on this issue have been inconsistent. The 5-HT system has also been suggested to be responsible for a significant portion of the behavioural aspects of AD. This study aimed to investigate the associations of the 5-HT transporter gene linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR) polymorphism with AD and delusional/aggressive symptoms of AD in Korean samples of 65 patients and 43 controls. The 5-HTTLPR polymorphism was neither associated with AD nor with delusional/aggressive symptoms of AD. It was suggested that phenotypic expression of the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism might be varied according to ethnic differences.
