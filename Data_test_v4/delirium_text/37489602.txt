37489602|t|A Study on the Effect of Traditional Chinese Exercise Combined With Rhythm Training on the Intervention of Older Adults With Mild Cognitive Impairment.
37489602|a|BACKGROUND: To examine the effect of combination exercise program on cognitive function of older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and identify biomarkers associated with improvement of cognitive functions. METHODS: Subjects were 42 older adults (ages, 60-80 years) with MCI. The subjects were randomly classified to traditional Chinese exercise combined with rhythm training group (TCE + RTG, n = 14), walking group (WG, n = 14), and control group (CG, n = 14), according to their level of MMSE scores. These groups exercised for 60 minutes at 1 session, 3 sessions a week for 12 weeks. The intervention program was conducted under multitask conditions to stimulate attention and memory, and the control group attended 3 education classes. Measurements were administered before, after the 6-week, and after the 12-week intervention period; Measurements: The Mini-mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT), Activities of Daily Living Scale (ADL), and the 17-item Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD-17), along with the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). A repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to examine differences among the 3 groups and between the 3 testing times (pre-test vs middle-test vs post-test). RESULTS: (1) The TCE + RTG showed significant improvement in the MMSE, MoCA, SDMT, and ADL scale test results (P < .01) and HAMD-17 scale test results (P < .05). The WG also showed significant improvement in the MMSE, MoCA, and HAMD-17 scale test results (P < .05) and the ADL scale test results (P < .01). While there was no significant change in the CG after the intervention. (2) The TCE + RTG and WG showed positive improvement in peripheral blood BDNF levels, while the CG showed a decrease in these test results. There were significant differences between the TCE + RTG and CG before and after the intervention. CONCLUSION: The results suggested that a TCE + RT is beneficial for improving memory and maintaining general cognitive function and peripheral blood BDNF levels in older adults with MCI. Peripheral blood BDNF levels may predict improvement of cognitive functions in older adults with MCI. Further studies are required to determine the positive effects of TCE + RT on cognitive function in older adults with MCI. Trial Registration: ChiCTR2200058545, Registered 10 April 2022.
