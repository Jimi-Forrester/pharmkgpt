37367096|t|Contribution of Different Brain Disorders and Multimorbidity to Delirium Superimposed Dementia (DSD).
37367096|a|Delirium, an acute neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by a disturbance of attention and awareness, is often superimposed on dementia with its progressive cognitive decline. Despite the high frequency and clinical relevance of this condition, often called delirium-superimposed dementia (DSD), little is known about possible triggers. In this study using the GePsy-B databank, we investigated the impact of the underlying brain disorder and multimorbidity (MM) on DSD. MM was measured by CIRS and the number of ICD-10 diagnoses. Dementia was diagnosed by CDR, and delirium by DSM IV TR criteria. A total of 218 patients were diagnosed with DSD and these were compared to 105 patients with only dementia, 46 with only delirium, and 197 patients suffering from other psychiatric diseases, mainly depression. No significant differences between groups were found concerning CIRS scores. Based on CT scans, DSD cases were grouped into those with cerebral atrophy only (probably pure neurodegenerative), with brain infarction, or with white matter hyperintensities (WMH), but no between-group differences regarding the MM indices could be found. Regression analysis only revealed age and dementia stage as influencing factors. Conclusion: Our results suggest that neither MM nor morphologic changes in the brain are predisposing factors for DSD.
