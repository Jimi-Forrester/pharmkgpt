29843232|t|A 'Framingham-like' Algorithm for Predicting 4-Year Risk of Progression to Amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment or Alzheimer's Disease Using Multidomain Information.
29843232|a|BACKGROUND: There are no agreed-upon variables for predicting progression from unimpaired cognition to amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), or from aMCI to Alzheimer's disease (AD). OBJECTIVE: Use ADNI data to develop a 'Framingham-like' prediction model for a 4-year period. METHODS: We developed models using the strongest baseline predictors from six domains (demographics, neuroimaging, CSF biomarkers, genetics, cognitive tests, and functional ability). We chose the best predictor from each domain, which was dichotomized into more versus less harmful. RESULTS: There were 224 unimpaired individuals and 424 aMCI subjects with baseline data on all predictors, of whom 37 (17% ) and 150 (35% ) converted to aMCI and AD, respectively, during 4 years of follow-up. For the unimpaired, CSF tau/Abeta ratio, hippocampal volume, and a memory score predicted progression. For those aMCI at baseline, the same predictors plus APOE4 status and functional ability predicted progression. Demographics and family history were not important predictors for progression for either group. The fit statistic was good for the unimpaired-aMCI model (C-statistic 0.80) and very good for the aMCI-AD model (C-statistic 0.91). Among the unimpaired, those with no harmful risk factors had a 4-year predicted 2% risk of progression, while those with the most harmful risk factors had a predicted 35% risk. The aMCI subjects with no harmful risk factors had a predicted 1% risk of progression those with all six harmful risk factors had a predicted 90% risk. CONCLUSION: Our parsimonious model accurately predicted progression from unimpaired to aMCI with three variables, and from aMCI to AD with five variables.
