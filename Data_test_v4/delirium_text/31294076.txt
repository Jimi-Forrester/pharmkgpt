31294076|a|INTRODUCTION: The implementation of spatial-covariance [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-based disease-related metabolic brain patterns as biomarkers has been hampered by intercenter imaging differences. Within the scope of the JPND-PETMETPAT working group, we illustrate the impact of these differences on Parkinson's disease-related pattern (PDRP) expression scores. METHODS: Five healthy controls, 5 patients with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, and 5 patients with Parkinson's disease were scanned on one positron emission tomography/computed tomography system with multiple image reconstructions. In addition, one Hoffman 3D Brain Phantom was scanned on several positron emission tomography/computed tomography systems using various reconstructions. Effects of image contrast on PDRP scores were also examined. RESULTS: Human and phantom raw PDRP scores were systematically influenced by scanner and reconstruction effects. PDRP scores correlated inversely to image contrast. A Gaussian spatial filter reduced contrast while decreasing intercenter score differences. DISCUSSION: Image contrast should be considered in harmonization efforts. A Gaussian filter may reduce noise and intercenter effects without sacrificing sensitivity. Phantom measurements will be important for correcting PDRP score offsets.
