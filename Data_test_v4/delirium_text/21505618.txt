21505618|t|Making the hospital safer for older adult patients: a focus on the indwelling urinary catheter.
21505618|a|The needs of hospitalized geriatric patients differ from the needs of hospitalized younger adults. In an attempt to improve systems of care for the older adult, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services classified urinary tract infections related to the use of indwelling urinary catheters (IUC) as one of eight "never events." The insertion of an IUC is a commonly performed procedure that can cause an array of iatrogenic complications. In addition, the placement of an IUC without medical indication is a risk factor for prolonged hospitalization and inpatient mortality. Foley catheterization has been documented as a culprit in urosepsis and as being associated with geriatric syndromes such as delirium and functional impairment. This article will discuss the indications for the IUC, the complications that can occur because of the IUC, and comment on the Kaiser Permanente Southern California Region's efforts to minimize the unnecessary use of the IUC. Thoughtful and judicious use of the IUC, such as minimizing the use of urinary catheterization, either by not inserting an IUC or by removing it as soon as it is no longer needed, will most likely reduce inpatient morbidity and improve the health of the hospitalized older adult.
