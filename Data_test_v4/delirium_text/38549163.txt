However its pathogenic mechanism remains unclear, and effective treatments for 16p11.2  + / -    syndrome are lacking. Emerging evidence suggests that the gut microbiota and its metabolites are inextricably linked to host behavior through the gut-brain axis and are therefore implicated in ASD development. Despite this, the functional roles of microbial metabolites in the context of 16p11.2  + / -    are yet to be elucidated. This study aims to investigate the therapeutic potential of indole-3-propionic acid (IPA), a gut microbiota metabolite, in addressing behavioral and neural deficits associated with 16p11.2  + / -   , as well as the underlying molecular mechanisms. RESULTS: Mice with the 16p11.2  + / -    showed dysbiosis of the gut microbiota and a significant decrease in IPA levels in feces and blood circulation. Further, these mice exhibited significant social and cognitive memory impairments, along with hyperactivation of hippocampal dentate gyrus neurons and reduced inhibitory synaptic transmission in this region. However, oral administration of IPA effectively mitigated the histological and electrophysiological alterations, thereby ameliorating the social and cognitive deficits of the mice. Remarkably, IPA treatment significantly increased the phosphorylation level of ERK1, a protein encoded by the Mapk3 gene in the 16p11.2 region, without affecting the transcription and translation of the Mapk3 gene. CONCLUSIONS: Our study reveals that 16p11.2  + / -    leads to a decline in gut metabolite IPA levels; however, IPA supplementation notably reverses the behavioral and neural phenotypes of 16p11.2  + / -    mice. These findings provide new insights into the critical role of gut microbial metabolites in ASD pathogenesis and present a promising treatment strategy for social and cognitive memory deficit disorders, such as 16p11.2 microdeletion syndrome.
