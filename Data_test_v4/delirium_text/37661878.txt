OBJECTIVE: To disentangle the massive heterogeneities in Alzheimer's disease (AD) progressions and identify vulnerable/critical brain regions to AD pathology. METHODS: In this work, we characterized the interaction of AT[N] biomarkers and their propagation across brain networks using a novel bistable reaction-diffusion model, which allows us to establish a new systems biology underpinning of AD progression. We applied our model to large-scale longitudinal neuroimages from the ADNI database and studied the systematic vulnerability and criticality of brains. RESULTS: Our model yields long term prediction that is statistically significant linear correlated with temporal imaging data, produces clinically consistent risk prediction, and captures the Braak-like spreading pattern of AT[N] biomarkers in AD development. CONCLUSIONS: Our major findings include (i) tau is a stronger indicator of regional risk compared to amyloid, (ii) temporal lobe exhibits higher vulnerability to AD-related pathologies, (iii) proposed critical brain regions outperform hub nodes in transmitting disease factors across the brain, and (iv) comparing the spread of neuropathological burdens caused by amyloid-beta and tau diffusions, disruption of metabolic balance is the most determinant factor contributing to the initiation and progression of AD.
