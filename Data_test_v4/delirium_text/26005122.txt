The place of the anticoagulants in the management of cervical artery dissections remains uncertain, while the benefit of the blood pressure control in the secondary prevention of deep and lobar intracerebral hemorrhages is critical. The development of cardiac MRI, prolonged cardiac monitoring and transcranial doppler seems to improve the diagnosis of cardio-embolic sources of stroke. EPILEPSY: A specialized urgent-access single seizure clinic represents a model which reduces wait-times and improves patient access after a first fit. Co-locating a psychiatrist within outpatient epilepsy center leads to a reduction in psychiatric symptoms and people with psychogenic non-epileptic seizures. When neurologists around the world assess identical case scenarios for the diagnosis of epilepsy, concordance is between moderate and poor, showing that epilepsy diagnosis remains difficult. More than one third of elderly with new-onset epilepsy of unknown etiology exhibit temporal lobe atrophy on brain imaging. MOVEMENT DISORDERS: There is no major progress in the therapeutic approach of Parkinson's disease but the discovery of new genetic markers such as glucocerebrosidase mutations may greatly change our knowledge of the disease process and may induce new therapeutic strategies in the future. The natural history of the disease is also better understood from the prodromal phase to the post-mortem analysis of the brain and the classification of the processes based on abnormal protein deposits. DEMENTIA: The respective value of biomarkers (amyloid imaging versus CSF biomarkers) for in vivo diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been detailed. Therapeutic expectations mainly rely on anti-Abeta immunization trials performed in preclinical (and no longer prodromal) stages of AD, with the aim of slowing the evolution of neuronal loss. Besides a lot of communications on dementia genetics or physiopathogeny, fascinating and promising results were presented on deep brain stimulation for depression resistant to medical treatment. PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY: Ibudilast, administered with riluzole, is safe and tolerable in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), improves ALS function and delays progression. Patients with painful small fiber neuropathy have a high rate of mutations in the SCN9A gene, coding for Nav1.7 voltage-gated sodium-channels. Peripheral nerve lymphoma (NL) is a multifocal painful neuropathy that causes endoneurial inflammatory demyelination: primary NL is less severe than secondary NL, which occurs after remission, suggesting that nerve may be considered a "safe lymphoma haven". MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS (MS): Biotin in progressive forms of MS and daclizumab in relapsing-remitting forms appear to be promising treatments. In case of failure of current first-line and/or second-line therapeutics, alemtuzumab may be an interesting alternative treatment. Teriflunomide, dimethyl fumarate and fingolimod are oral treatments with confirmed efficacy and acceptable safety. Besides vitamin D insufficiency and smoking, which are confirmed risk factors for the disease, testosterone insufficiency (in males) and obesity are emerging risk factors, which could also be corrected.
