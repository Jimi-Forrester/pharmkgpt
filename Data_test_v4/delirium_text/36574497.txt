36574497|t|Efficacy and safety of ketamine for the treatment of depressive symptoms in palliative care: A systematic review.
36574497|a|OBJECTIVES: Ketamine has a fast-onset that may offer a paradigm change for depression at end-of-life. We aimed to synthesize evidence regarding the safety and/or efficacy of ketamine in depression treatment within a broad palliative care concept. METHODS: We searched seven databases and included studies on the safety and efficacy of ketamine for depression treatment in patients diagnosed with any life-threatening disease; further, we conducted a narrative review of the evidence. RESULTS: Among 2,252 screened titles and abstracts, we included 32 studies in our final synthesis. Specifically, we included 14 case reports, 2 case series, 2 quasi-experimental studies, and 7 randomized clinical trials, as well as data from three unpublished clinical trials and seven cases from four larger case series. Most case reports reported a robust effect; however, the larger studies reported conflicting findings. Five randomized clinical trials reported positive outcomes; however, four of them were focused on a perioperative setting. Further, two negative studies did not primarily focus on depression and did not apply severity cutoffs. CONCLUSIONS: Although ketamine is generally safe and potentially useful, its efficacy in palliative care settings remains unclear. It may be a reasonable alternative for perioperative depression in oncological patients.
