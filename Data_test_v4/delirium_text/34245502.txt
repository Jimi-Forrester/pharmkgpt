34245502|a|The analysis of experimental and partially clinical data about researches of neurobiological effects of tenuigenin - the most important bioactive substance of Polygala tenuifolia Willd. in this review was given. The neuroprotective and neurotrophic action of given substance were described in detail. It was noted, that the capacities of the tenuigenin to decrease the secretion of beta amyloid and to protect of neurons from damage by already made beta ameloids, to inhibit the processes of the tau proteins` hyperphosphorylation and inflammations in microglia, as well as increase the main synaptic transmission can be used by the development of effective therapeutic drugs aimed to reduce the pathogenesis of Alzheimer`s disease. The effects of dopaminergic neurons and mitochondrial membrane potential protection as well as reduction of alpha-synuclein phosphorylation can influence the processes by Parkinson`s disease. It was concluded, that the tenuigenin deserves further study and possibly will be used as augmentation of Alzheimer`s, Parkinson`s and other neurodegenerative diseases therapy.
