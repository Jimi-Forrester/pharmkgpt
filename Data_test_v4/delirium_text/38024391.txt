38024391|t|Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis and Alzheimer's disease: a bibliometric analysis.
38024391|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastative disease, the 1st most frequent neurodegenerative disease worldwide. Its prevalence is increasing and early detection methods as well as potential genomic based therapeutics are urgently needed. OBJECTIVES: To better characterize recent seq studies of AD and site recent relevant literature. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, the characteristics of neuronal cell populations in Alzheimer's disease (AD) have not been completely elucidated. METHODS: We conducted a dynamic and longitudinal bibliometric analysis to investigate existing studies on Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis and Alzheimer's Disease and identify data gaps and possible new research avenues. RESULTS: All AD papers concentrating on Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis were found using the search terms "Alzheimer's Disease", and "Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis" in the PubMed/MEDLINE database. Only English publications published between 2015 and 2023 were chosen using filters. CONCLUSIONS: Original English-language research publications disclosing Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis and Alzheimer's Disease were examined for inclusion. Two sets of independent reviewers discovered and extracted pertinent data. The bibliometric study was carried out using the R software packages Bibliometrix and Biblioshiny. The narrowed search yielded 158 publications, all published between 2015 and 2023. Yet, after applying filters and considering the inclusion requirements, the search results comprise just 51 original articles out of 158 articles. There were 107 articles eliminated. The importance of the discovery of Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis and Alzheimer's Disease a decade ago only grows with time. Our results have important implications for future studies of AD and may help researchers across the world better understand the global context of the Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis and Alzheimer's Disease link. This study puts emphasis on the critical need for more diverse participant demographics in Alzheimer's disease investigations.
