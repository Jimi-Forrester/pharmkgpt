15639925|a|To explore the expression differences of exon 9 and 10 in Amyloid Precursor Protein gene(APP9 approximately 10) in Alzheimer's disease,and detect the probable point mutation appeared in cDNA fragment of APP9 approximately 10 in the Shanghai Han people.semi-quantitative competitive RT-PCR technique was performed to detect the expression of APP9 approximately 10 in peripheral lymphocyte, and the Apolipoprotein E gene(ApoE) and Presenilin 1(PS1)gene were genotyped with PCR-RFLP method. We also analyzed the point mutation in APP9 approximately 10 cDNA through the denatured gel electrophoresis. The results are as follows:1. While compared with healthy controls,expression of APP9 approximately 10 mRNA was significantly enhanced in Alzheimer disease; 2.APOE*epsilon4 allele, the most common genetic risk factor for AD, did not affect the Expression of APP9 approximately 10 mRNA, whereas the APP9 approximately 10 mRNA expression might be increased by the allele 1 of PS1 gene, another probable susceptibility gene of AD.3. No point mutation in APP9 approximately 10 cDNA was detected. In our samples, the expression of APP9 approximately 10 mRNA in AD was significantly different from that of controls, suggesting that the change of peripheral APP9 approximately 10 mRNA expression might be another bio-marker used in clinical diagnosis for AD.
