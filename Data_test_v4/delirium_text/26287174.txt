26287174|t|Structure-Based Optimization of Inhibitors of the Aspartic Protease Endothiapepsin.
26287174|a|Aspartic proteases are a class of enzymes that play a causative role in numerous diseases such as malaria (plasmepsins), Alzheimer's disease (beta-secretase), fungal infections (secreted aspartic proteases), and hypertension (renin). We have chosen endothiapepsin as a model enzyme of this class of enzymes, for the design, preparation and biochemical evaluation of a new series of inhibitors of endothiapepsin. Here, we have optimized a hit, identified by de novo structure-based drug design (SBDD) and DCC, by using structure-based design approaches focusing on the optimization of an amide-pi interaction. Biochemical results are in agreement with SBDD. These results will provide useful insights for future structure-based optimization of inhibitors for the real drug targets as well as insights into molecular recognition.
