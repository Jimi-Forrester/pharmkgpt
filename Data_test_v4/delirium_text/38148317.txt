38148317|t|Protein Compartments Modulate Fibrillar Self-Assembly.
38148317|a|A notable feature of complex cellular environments is protein-rich compartments that are formed via liquid-liquid phase separation. Recent studies have shown that these biomolecular condensates can play both promoting and inhibitory roles in fibrillar protein self-assembly, a process that is linked to Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's, and various prion diseases. Yet, the exact regulatory role of these condensates in protein aggregation remains unknown. By employing microfluidics to create artificial protein compartments, the self-assembly behavior of the fibrillar protein lysozyme within them can be characterized. It is observed that the volumetric parameters of protein-rich compartments can change the kinetics of protein self-assembly. Depending on the change in compartment parameters, the lysozyme fibrillation process either accelerated or decelerated. Furthermore, the results confirm that the volumetric parameters govern not only the nucleation and growth phases of the fibrillar aggregates but also affect the crosstalk between the protein-rich and protein-poor phases. The appearance of phase-separated compartments in the vicinity of natively folded protein complexes triggers their abrupt percolation into the compartments' core and further accelerates protein aggregation. Overall, the results of the study shed more light on the complex behavior and functions of protein-rich phases and, importantly, on their interaction with the surrounding environment.
