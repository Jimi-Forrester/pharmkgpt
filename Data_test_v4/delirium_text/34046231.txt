34046231|t|Acute Airway Obstruction from Megaoesophagus Secondary to Achalasia Evaluated with Flexible Bronchoscope.
34046231|a|A 94-year-old female presented to the emergency department with acute expiratory stridor. In the absence of an otorhinolaryngologist, an urgent laryngoscopy was performed using a flexible bronchoscope by an anaesthesiologist in the emergency department leading to a change in management. Subsequent radiographs confirmed severe tracheal compression from megaoesophagus secondary to achalasia as the cause of acute airway obstruction. Use of flexible bronchoscope as a diagnostic tool by an anaesthesiologist to evaluate a patient presenting with signs of acute airway obstruction may lead to a safer and more careful airway management planning. Suggestions are also made regarding establishment of emergency surgical airways when conventional approaches fail.
