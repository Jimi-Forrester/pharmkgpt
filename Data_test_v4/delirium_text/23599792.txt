23599792|a|The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of synuclein-gamma (SNCG) downregulation by RNA interference (RNAi) on the clonogenicity and invasiveness of MCF-7 breast cancer cells. This study used four pairs of SNCG-specific siRNAs which were designed and cloned into the pGPU6 plasmid for introduction into an MCF-7 cell line. The SNCG knockdown efficacies of the four siRNAs were compared using the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunocytochemistry. The cells' clonogenic and invasive phenotypes were examined with clonogenic and Boyden chamber assays. In comparison with the non-specific siRNA and empty vector controls, all four SNCG siRNAs were observed to significantly inhibit SNCG expression at the mRNA and protein levels (F=481.06, P<0.001; F=147.42, P<0.0001). SNCG suppression mediated by RNAi successfully inhibited the clonogenicity (P=0.002) and invasiveness (P<0.001) of transfected MCF-7 cells. According to the results of the present study, we concluded that SNCG suppression mediated by RNAi significantly suppressed SNCG expression at the mRNA and protein levels, suggesting that SNCG suppression mediated by an RNAi strategy may become a novel approach for treating advanced breast cancer.
