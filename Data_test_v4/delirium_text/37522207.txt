37522207|t|A Higher Whole-Body Extracellular to Intracellular Water Ratio Is Associated with Increased Odds of Cognitive Impairment in Hemodialysis Patients.
37522207|a|BACKGROUND: Cognitive impairment (CI) is highly prevalent in patients undergoing hemodialysis. Whether fluid overload with malnutrition as assessed by the ratio of extracellular water to intracellular water (ECW/ICW) is associated with CI in patients on maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) has yet to be studied. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the association between ECW/ICW and CI in patients with MHD. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, cross-sectional study that enrolled 3,025 adult patients with MHD. Cognitive function was assessed through the Mini-Mental State Examination. The ECW/ICW was derived from a portable body composition monitor and analyzed by quartiles. RESULTS: 23.04% of participants had CI in our study. The prevalence of CI tended to increase as the quartiles of the ECW/ICW ratio increased. Unadjusted analysis showed that participants in quartile 4 were 3.02 times more likely to have a CI compared to those in quartile 1. After adjusting for age, sex, education, smoking status, body mass index, dialysis vintage, history of hypertension, and history of stroke, the adjusted OR (95% CI) for the highest quartile of ECW/ICW ratio was 1.36 (1.01, 1.83) for CI compared with the lowest quartile. Interestingly, the association between ECW/ICW ratio and CI persisted across all subgroups stratified by age, gender, history of diabetes, and stroke. (p for interaction > 0.05 for all). CONCLUSION: An increased ECW/ICW ratio is associated with higher odds of cognitive impairment in patients undergoing hemodialysis.
