38020984|t|Incidence and outcome of patients suffering from meningitis due to spondylodiscitis.
38020984|a|Introduction: Meningitis is a rare but severe complication in patients with spondylodiscitis. Data about the incidence and clinical management are rare. Research question: Aim of this study was to assess the incidence, clinical course and outcome of patients suffering from meningitis due to spondylodiscitis. Material and methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of our prospective clinical database that included all patients suffering from spondylodiscitis between January 2010 and December 2019 were included. We assessed clinical findings, laboratory tests, treatment and outcome comparing patients with and without meningitis. Results: Out of 469 patients suffering from spondylodiscitis, 30 patients (14 female) were diagnosed with an associated meningitis (6.4%). The mean CSF cell count was 3375.85 +- 8486.78/mul (range 32-41500/mul). The mean age at presentation was 70.87 +- 8.84 yrs (range 48-88 yrs). Mean C-reactive protein (CRP) and white blood cell (WBC) counts at time of admission were statistically higher in patients with associated meningitis (CRP: 19.81 +- 12.56 mg/dl vs. 11.63 +- 11.08 mg/dl, p = 0.001; WBC: 14.67 +- 7.76 g/l vs. 10.88 +- 05.11 g/l, p = 0.005. Mortality was also higher, as 13.3% and 7.1% of patients with and without concomitant meningitis died, respectively. Conclusion: Bacterial meningitis due to spondylodiscitis is a rare but severe condition and is associated with higher morbidity and mortality rates. In patients with spondylodiscitis presenting with an altered state of consciousness an associated meningitis should be ruled out.
