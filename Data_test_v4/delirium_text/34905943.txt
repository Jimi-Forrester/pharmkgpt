34905943|a|We review the implications of the recently approved aducanumab amyloid-beta immunotherapy for treating Alzheimer disease with comorbid cerebral amyloid angiopathy. In clinical trials, amyloid-beta immunotherapy has been associated with a high rate of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities, potentially driven by coexisting cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Therefore, immunotherapy's efficacy in patients may be modified by coexisting cerebrovascular pathology. We discuss the contributions of cerebral amyloid angiopathy on the development of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities and propose strategies to identify cerebral amyloid angiopathy in patients considered for immunotherapy.
