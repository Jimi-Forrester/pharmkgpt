38021811|t|From Symptomatic Treatment to Disease Modification: A Turning Point in Alzheimer's Disease Management.
38021811|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease primarily affecting individuals aged 65 or above. AD leads to progressive cognitive and functional decline, affecting daily life activities. Amyloid plaques are the pathological hallmark of AD, resulting in the loss of neurons and their connections in the brain. For years, patients with AD were treated with pharmacotherapies having only symptomatic effects. Till 2023, no drug was approved for disease-modifying potential. The Food and Drug Administration approved Lecanemab and aducanumab as the first therapy with disease-modifying effects in 2023. Lecanemab has shown efficacy in several trials, with the potential to improve cognition in AD patients. In this article, we will discuss the treatment options for AD, emphasizing the newly approved monoclonal antibodies and their prospects.
