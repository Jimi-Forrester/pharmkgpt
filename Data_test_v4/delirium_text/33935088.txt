33935088|t|Association Between the APOEe2/e4 Genotype and Alzheimer's Disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment Among African Americans.
33935088|a|We examined the association between APOEe2/e4 with incident Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) among African Americans using the national dataset from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) from 2005 to September 2019. Compared to e3/e3 carriers, e2/e4 carriers exhibited a similar risk of incident AD (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 0.85, 95% CI [0.39, 1.84]) among the AD cohort and similar risk of incident MCI (aHR = 0.88, 95% CI [0.51, 1.50]) among the MCI cohort. Our findings suggest that, unlike the increased risk of AD and MCI in non-Latino whites, APOEe2/e4 genotype is not associated with the incidence of AD and MCI among African Americans.
