35434769|a|Infection of the CNS with the SARS-CoV-2 can occur via different routes and results in para- or post-infectious manifestations with a variety of neurological symptoms. In patients with neurodegenerative diseases, SARS-CoV-2 is often associated with a higher fatality rate, which is a relevant problem in increasingly older populations. Apart from the direct consequences of an infection in patients with neurodegenerative diseases, indirect consequences of the pandemic such as limited access to care facilities and treatment have negative effects on the course of these chronic disorders. The occurrence of long-lasting neurological symptoms after infection with SARS-CoV-2 indicates a prolonged impact on the CNS. However, while it is known that SARS-CoV-2 affects neuronal populations that are relevant in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, it is yet unclear whether an infection with SARS-CoV-2 is sufficient to trigger neurodegeneration. Reflecting on the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on neurodegeneration, we provide a concise overview on the current knowledge of SARS-CoV-2-induced pathology in the CNS and discuss yet open questions in the field.
