39063177|t|Comparative Proteomic Profiling of Blood Plasma Revealed Marker Proteins Involved in Temporal Lobe Epilepsy.
39063177|a|Temporal lobe epilepsy has various origins, involving or not involving structural changes in brain tissue. The mechanisms of epileptogenesis are associated with cell regulation and signaling disruptions expressed in varied levels of proteins. The blood plasma proteomic profiling of temporal lobe epilepsy patients (including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-positive and MRI-negative ones) and healthy volunteers using mass spectrometry and label-free quantification revealed a list of differently expressed proteins. Several apolipoproteins (APOA1, APOD, and APOA4), serpin protease inhibitors (SERPINA3, SERPINF1, etc.), complement components (C9, C8, and C1R), and a total of 42 proteins were found to be significantly upregulated in the temporal lobe epilepsy group. A classification analysis of these proteins according to their biological functions, as well as a review of the published sources, disclosed the predominant involvement of the processes mostly affected during epilepsy such as neuroinflammation, intracellular signaling, lipid metabolism, and oxidative stress. The presence of several proteins related to the corresponding compensatory mechanisms has been noted. After further validation, the newly identified temporal lobe epilepsy biomarker candidates may be used as epilepsy diagnostic tools, in addition to other less specific methods such as electroencephalography or MRI.
