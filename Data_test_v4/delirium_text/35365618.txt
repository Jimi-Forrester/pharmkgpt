35365618|a|Receptor interacting serine/threonine protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) activation and necroptosis have been genetically and mechanistically linked with human multiple sclerosis and neurodegenerative diseases for which demyelination is a common key pathology. Demyelination can be healed through remyelination which is mediated by new oligodendrocytes derived from the adult oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs). Unfortunately, the efficiency of remyelination declines with progressive aging partially due to the depletion of OPCs following chronic or repeated demyelination. However, to our knowledge, so far there is no drug which enhances proliferation of OPCs, and it is unknown whether inhibiting RIPK1 activity directly affect OPCs, the central player of remyelination. Using TNFalpha induced RIPK1-dependent necroptosis in Jurkat FADD-/- cells as a cell death assay, we screened from 2112 FDA-approved drugs and the drug candidates of new RIPK1 inhibitors selected by ourselves, and identified ZJU-37, a small molecule modified by introducing an amide bond to Nec-1s, is a new RIPK1 kinase inhibitor with higher potency than Nec-1s which has the best reported potency. We unveil in addition to protecting myelin from demyelination and axons from degeneration, ZJU-37 exhibits a new role on promoting proliferation of OPCs and enhancing remyelination by inhibiting RIPK1 kinase activity with higher potency than Nec-1s. Mechanistically, ZJU-37 promotes proliferation of OPCs by enhancing the transcription of platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha via NF-kappaB pathway. This work identifies ZJU-37 as a new drug candidate which enhances remyelination by promoting proliferation of OPCs, paving the way for a potential drug to enhance myelin repair.
