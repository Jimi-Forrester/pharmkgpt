25789616|a|OBJECTIVE: To assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of the Fc-inactivated anti-beta amyloid (Abeta) monoclonal antibody (mAb) GSK933776 in patients with mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI). METHODS: This was a two-part, single blind, placebo-controlled, first-time-in-human (FTIH) study of single (n = 18) and repeat dose (n = 32) intravenous GSK933776 0.001-6 mg/kg (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00459550). Additional safety data from an open-label, uncontrolled, single dose study of intravenous GSK933776 1-6 mg/kg (n = 18) are included (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01424436). RESULTS: There were no cases of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities-edema (ARIA-E) or -hemorrhage (ARIA-H) after GSK933776 administration in both studies. Three patients across the two studies developed anti-GSK933776 antibodies. Plasma GSK933776 half-life (t1/2) was 10-15 days after repeat dosing. After each of three administrations of GSK933776, plasma levels of total Abeta42 and Abeta increased whereas plasma levels of free Abeta decreased dose dependently; no changes were observed for placebo. For total Abeta42 the peak:trough ratio was <=2 at doses >=3 mg/kg; for total Abeta the ratio was <=2 at 6 mg/kg. CSF concentrations of Abeta showed increases from baseline to week 12 for Abeta X-38 (week 12:baseline ratio: 1.65; 95%CI: 1.38, 1.93) and Abeta X-42 (week 12:baseline ratio: 1.18; 95%CI: 1.06, 1.30) for values pooled across doses. CONCLUSION: In this FTIH study the Fc-inactivated anti-Abeta mAb GSK933776 engaged its target in plasma and CSF without causing brain ARIA-E/H in patients with mild AD or MCI. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00459550.
