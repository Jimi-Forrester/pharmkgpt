35687573|a|alpha-Synuclein (alpha-syn) proteinopathy in the neurons of the Enteric Nervous System (ENS) is proposed to have a critical role in Parkinson's disease (PD) onset and progression. Interestingly, the ENS of the human appendix harbors abundant alpha-syn and appendectomy has been linked to a decreased risk and delayed onset of PD, suggesting that the appendix may influence PD pathology. Common marmosets and rhesus macaques lack a distinct appendix (a narrow closed-end appendage with a distinct change in diameter at the junction with the cecum), yet the cecal microanatomy of these monkeys is similar to the human appendix. Sections of human appendix (n = 3) and ceca from common marmosets (n = 4) and rhesus macaques (n = 3) were evaluated to shed light on the microanatomy and the expression of PD-related proteins. Analysis confirmed that the human appendix and marmoset and rhesus ceca present thick walls comprised of serosa, muscularis externa, submucosa, and mucosa plus abundant lymphoid tissue. Across all three species, the myenteric plexus of the ENS was located within the muscularis externa with nerve fibers innervating all layers of the appendix/ceca. Expression of alpha-syn and tau in the appendix/cecum was present within myenteric ganglia and along nerve fibers of the muscularis externa and mucosa in all species. In the myenteric ganglia alpha-syn, p-alpha-syn, tau and p-tau immunoreactivities (ir) were not significantly different across species. The percent area above threshold of alpha-syn-ir and tau-ir in the nerve fibers of the muscularis externa and mucosa were greater in the human appendix than in the NHP ceca (alpha-syn-ir p<0.05; tau-ir p<0.05). Overall, this study provides critical translational evidence that the common marmoset and rhesus macaque ceca are remarkably similar to the human appendix and, thus, that these NHP species are suitable for studying the development of PD linked to alpha-syn and tau pathological changes in the ENS.
