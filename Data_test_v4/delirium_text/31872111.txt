31872111|a|Cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs) are characterized by abnormally dilated intracranial capillaries that result in increased susceptibility to stroke. Three genes have been identified as causes of CCMs; KRIT1 (CCM1), MGC4607 (CCM2) and PDCD10 (CCM3); one of them is disrupted in most CCM cases. It was demonstrated that both CCM1 and CCM3 bind to CCM2 to form a CCM signaling complex (CSC) to modulate angiogenesis. In this report, we deployed both RNA-seq and proteomic analysis of perturbed CSC after depletion of one of three CCM genes to generate interactomes for system-wide studies. Our results demonstrated a unique portrait detailing alterations in angiogenesis and vascular integrity. Interestingly, only in-direct overlapped alterations between RNA and protein levels were detected, supporting the existence of multiple layers of regulation in CSC cascades. Notably, this is the first report identifying that both beta4 integrin and CAV1 signaling are downstream of CSC, conveying the angiogenic signaling. Our results provide a global view of signal transduction modulated by the CSC, identifies novel regulatory signaling networks and key cellular factors associated with CSC.
