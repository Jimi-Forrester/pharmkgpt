37049568|a|Convolvulus pluricaulis (CP) is a common Indian herb, largely employed in Ayurvedic medicine and known for its neuroprotective and neuroinflammatory action. Its effectiveness against several pathologic/sub-pathologic conditions is widely accepted, but it is not yet completely chemically characterized. In recent years, several researchers have pointed out the involvement of CP and other Convolvulaceae in lipidic and glucidic metabolism, particularly in the control of hyperlipidaemia and diabetic conditions. In this scenario, the aim of the study was to chemically characterize the medium polarity part of the CP whole plant and its fractions and to shed light on their biological activity in adipocyte differentiation using the 3T3-L1 cell model. Our results demonstrated that the CP extract and fractions could upregulate the adipocyte differentiation through the modulation of the nuclear receptor PPARgamma (Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor gamma), broadly recognized as a key regulator of adipocyte differentiation, and the glucose transporter GLUT-4, which is fundamental for cellular glucose uptake and for metabolism control. CP also showed the ability to exert an anti-inflammatory effect, downregulating cytokines such as Rantes, MCP-1, KC, eotaxin, and GM-CSF, which are deeply involved in insulin resistance and glucose intolerance. Taken together, these data suggest that CP could exert a potential beneficial effect on glycemia and could be employed as an anti-diabetic adjuvant or, in any case, a means to better control glucose homeostasis.
