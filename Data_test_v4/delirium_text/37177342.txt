37177342|t|Nanoparticle-Based Drug Delivery Systems: An Inspiring Therapeutic Strategy for Neurodegenerative Diseases.
37177342|a|Neurodegenerative diseases are common, incurable neurological disorders with high prevalence, and lead to memory, movement, language, and intelligence impairments, threatening the lives and health of patients worldwide. The blood-brain barrier (BBB), a physiological barrier between the central nervous system and peripheral blood circulation, plays an important role in maintaining the homeostasis of the intracerebral environment by strictly regulating the transport of substances between the blood and brain. Therefore, it is difficult for therapeutic drugs to penetrate the BBB and reach the brain, and this affects their efficacy. Nanoparticles (NPs) can be used as drug transport carriers and are also known as nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems (NDDSs). These systems not only increase the stability of drugs but also facilitate the crossing of drugs through the BBB and improve their efficacy. In this article, we provided an overview of the types and administration routes of NPs, highlighted the preclinical and clinical studies of NDDSs in neurodegenerative diseases, and summarized the combined therapeutic strategies in the management of neurodegenerative diseases. Finally, the prospects and challenges of NDDSs in recent basic and clinical research were also discussed. Above all, NDDSs provide an inspiring therapeutic strategy for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.
