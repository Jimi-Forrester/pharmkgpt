39275263|a|Recent studies have reported the benefits of food-derived peptides for memory dysfunction. Beyond the physiological effects of peptides, their bioavailability to the brain still remains unclear since the blood-brain barrier (BBB) strictly controls the transportation of compounds to the brain. Here, updated transportation studies on BBB transportable peptides are introduced and evaluated using in vitro BBB models, in situ perfusion, and in vivo mouse experiments. Additionally, the mechanisms of action of brain health peptides in relation to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Alzheimer's disease, are discussed. This discussion follows a summary of bioactive peptides with neuroprotective effects that can improve cognitive decline through various mechanisms, including anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, anti-amyloid beta aggregation, and neurotransmitter regulation.
