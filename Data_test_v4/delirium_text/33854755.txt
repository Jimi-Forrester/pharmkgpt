33854755|t|Immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced aseptic meningitis and encephalitis: a case-series and narrative review.
33854755|a|BACKGROUND: Along with the increasing use of immune checkpoint inhibitors comes a surge in immune-related toxicity. Here, we review the currently available data regarding neurological immune adverse events, and more specifically aseptic meningitis and encephalitis, and present treatment and diagnostic recommendations. Furthermore, we present five cases of immunotherapy-induced aseptic meningitis and encephalitis treated at our institution. RECENT FINDINGS: Neurological immune-related adverse events, including aseptic meningitis and encephalitis, secondary to checkpoint inhibitors are a rare but complex and clinically relevant entity, comprising a wide range of diseases, most often presenting with symptoms with a wide range of differential diagnoses. Our case-series highlights the challenges of such entities and the importance of properly identifying and managing aseptic meningitis and encephalitis. SUMMARY: Checkpoint inhibitor-induced meningoencephalitis warrants prompt investigations and treatment. Properly diagnosing aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, or mixed presentations may guide the treatment decision, as highlighted by our case-series. After rapid exclusion of alternative diagnoses, urgent corticosteroids are the therapeutic backbone but this could change in favour of highly specific cytokine-directed treatment options. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: Aseptic meningitis and encephalitis with immune checkpoint inhibitors: a single centre case-series and review of the literature Over the course of the past decade, checkpoint inhibitors have revolutionized cancer care. With their favourable toxicity profile and potential for durable and deep responses, they have become ubiquitous across the field of oncology. Furthermore, combination checkpoint inhibitors are also gaining ground, with increased efficacy and, unfortunately, immune-related toxicity. While there are guidelines based on extensive clinical experience for frequent adverse events, uncommon entities are less readily identified and treated. Neurological immune-related adverse events secondary to checkpoint inhibitors are a rare but complex entity, comprising a wide range of diseases, most often presenting with aspecific symptoms. In this paper, we discuss a single institution case-series of patients with autoimmune aseptic meningitis and encephalitis, and we perform a narrative literature review on this subject. We conclude with our treatment recommendations based on available evidence.
