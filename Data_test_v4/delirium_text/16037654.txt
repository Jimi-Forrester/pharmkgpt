16037654|a|In this paper many critical reflections on diagnosis management of patients affected by dementia have been reported. In particular, the importance of clinico-neuropsychological evaluation of patients with respect to management prevalently based on neuropsychological tests is underlined. In this view a periodic diagnostic exercise with the objective of improving the diagnostic approach of dementias has been proposed to the Alzheimer's disease units (UVA) included in the Cronos Project.
