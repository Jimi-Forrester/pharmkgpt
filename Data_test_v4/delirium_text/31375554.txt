31375554|a|Objective: The aim of the present study was to explore the genetic association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in interleukin-16 (IL-16) gene with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) susceptibility in a Chinese Han population.Methods: In total, 133 T2DM patients and 127 healthy controls matched by age and gender were recruited in the case-control study. IL-16 gene rs4778889 and rs11556218 polymorphisms were genotyped in the two groups via polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method. Differences in genotype and allele distributions between groups were compared by the chi2 test. All the comparisons were adjusted for age, gender, and body mass index (BMI) by logistic regression. The odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to evaluate the association strength between IL-16 gene polymorphism and T2DM risk.Results: The TG genotype and G allele frequencies of rs11556218 increased remarkably in the case group than that in controls (45.86 vs 33.86%; 29.70 vs 20.87%), and the differences reached a significant level (P<0.05). After adjusting for age, gender, and BMI, the differences still reached a significant level (P<0.05). Rs11556218 TG genotype carriers had a 1.769-fold increased risk of developing T2DM (OR = 1.769, 95% CI = 1.045-2.994), and G allele was also associated with an increased risk of T2DM (OR = 1.639, 95% CI = 1.087-2.471). IL-16 rs4778889 polymorphism showed no significant association with T2DM risk.Conclusion:IL-16 gene rs11556218 polymorphism was significantly associated with T2DM susceptibility in the Chinese Han population, while rs4778889 was not.
