38953497|a|Munc18-1 is an SM (sec1/munc-like) family protein involved in vesicle fusion and neuronal exocytosis. Munc18-1 is known to regulate the exocytosis process by binding with closed- and open-state conformations of Syntaxin1, a protein belonging to the SNARE family established to be central to the exocytosis process. Our previous work studied peptide p5 as a promising drug candidate for CDK5-p25 complex, an Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathological target. Experimental in vivo and in vitro studies suggest that Munc18-1 promotes p5 to selectively inhibit the CDK5-p25 complex without affecting the endogenous CDK5 activity, a characteristic of remarkable therapeutic implications. In this paper, we identify several binding modes of p5 with Munc18-1 that could potentially affect the Munc18-1 binding with SNARE proteins and lead to off-target effects on neuronal communication using molecular dynamics simulations. Recent studies indicate that disruption of Munc18-1 function not only disrupts neurotransmitter release but also results in neurodegeneration, exhibiting clinical resemblance to other neurodegenerative conditions such as AD, causing diagnostic and treatment challenges. We characterize such interactions between p5 and Munc18-1, define the corresponding pharmacophores, and provide guidance for the in vitro validation of our findings to improve therapeutic efficacy and safety of p5.
