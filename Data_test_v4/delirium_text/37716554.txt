37716554|t|012 facets modulated LDH composite for neurotoxicity risk assessment through direct electrochemical profiling of dopamine.
37716554|a|Rising concerns of pesticide-induced neurotoxicity and neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and Multiple Sclerosis, are exacerbated by overexposure to contaminated waterbodies. Therefore, evaluating the risk accurately requires reliable monitoring of related biomarkers like dopamine (DA) through electrochemical detection. Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have shown great potential in sensors, however, to meet the challenges of rapid detection of large patient cohorts in real-time biological media, they should be further tailored to display superior analytical readouts. Herein, a ternary LDH (Ni2CoMn0.5) was integrated with the sheets of thermally reduced graphene oxide (trGO), to expose more highly active edge planes of the LDH, as opposed to its generally observed inert basal planes. The improvement in detection performance through such a modulated structure-property is a prospect that hasn't been previously explored for any other LDH-based materials employed in sensing applications. The 2 folds superior electrochemical activity exhibited by the face-on oriented LDH with trGO as compared to the pristine LDH material was further employed for direct detection of DA in real blood plasma samples. Moreover, the designed sensor exhibited exceptional selectivity towards the detection of DA with a limit of detection of 34.6 nM for a wide dynamic range of 0.001-5 mM with exceptional stability retaining 88.56% of the initial current even after storage in ambient conditions for 30 days.
