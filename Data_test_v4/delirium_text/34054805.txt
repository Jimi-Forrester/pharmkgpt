34054805|t|The Impact of Dietary Sphingolipids on Intestinal Microbiota and Gastrointestinal Immune Homeostasis.
34054805|a|The large surfaces of gastrointestinal (GI) organs are well adapted to their diverse tasks of selective nutritional uptake and defense against the external environment. To maintain a functional balance, a vast number of immune cells is located within the mucosa. A strictly regulated immune response is required to impede constant inflammation and to maintain barrier function. An increasing prevalence of GI diseases has been reported in Western societies over the past decades. This surge in GI disorders has been linked to dietary changes followed by an imbalance of the gut microbiome, leading to a chronic, low grade inflammation of the gut epithelium. To counteract the increasing health care costs associated with diseases, it is paramount to understand the mechanisms driving immuno-nutrition, the associations between nutritional compounds, the commensal gut microbiota, and the host immune response. Dietary compounds such as lipids, play a central role in GI barrier function. Bioactive sphingolipids (SLs), e.g. sphingomyelin (SM), sphingosine (Sph), ceramide (Cer), sphingosine-1- phosphate (S1P) and ceramide-1-phosphate (C1P) may derive from dietary SLs ingested through the diet. They are not only integral components of cell membranes, they additionally modulate cell trafficking and are precursors for mediators and second messenger molecules. By regulating intracellular calcium levels, cell motility, cell proliferation and apoptosis, SL metabolites have been described to influence GI immune homeostasis positively and detrimentally. Furthermore, dietary SLs are suggested to induce a shift in the gut microbiota. Modes of action range from competing with the commensal bacteria for intestinal cell attachment to prevention from pathogen invasion by regulating innate and immediate defense mechanisms. SL metabolites can also be produced by gut microorganisms, directly impacting host metabolic pathways. This review aims to summarize recent findings on SL signaling and functional variations of dietary SLs. We highlight novel insights in SL homeostasis and SL impact on GI barrier function, which is directly linked to changes of the intestinal microbiota. Knowledge gaps in current literature will be discussed to address questions relevant for understanding the pivotal role of dietary SLs on chronic, low grade inflammation and to define a balanced and healthy diet for disease prevention and treatment.
