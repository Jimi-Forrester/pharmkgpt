36936136|t|A Comprehensive Investigation of the Potential Role of Lipoproteins and Metabolite Profile as Biomarkers of Alzheimer's Disease Compared to the Known CSF Biomarkers.
36936136|a|Introduction: While cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) core biomarkers have been considered diagnostic biomarkers for a long time, special attention has been recently dedicated to lipoproteins and metabolites that could be potentially associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) neurodegeneration. Herein, we aimed to investigate the relationship between the levels of CSF core biomarkers including Abeta-42, TAU, and P-TAU and plasma lipoproteins and metabolites of patients with AD from the baseline cohort of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Method: Using the ADNI database, fourteen subclasses of lipoproteins as well as a number of lipids and fatty acids and low-molecular metabolites including amino acids, ketone bodies, and glycolysis-related metabolites in blood samples were measured as potential noninvasive markers, and their association with the CSF core biomarkers was statistically investigated controlling for age and gender. Results: A total number of 251 AD subjects were included, among whom 71 subjects were negative for the Apo-E epsilon4 allele and 150 were positive. There was no significant difference between the two groups regarding cognitive assessments, CSF core biomarkers, and lipoproteins and metabolites except the level of Abeta-42 (p < 0.001) and phenylalanine (p = 0.049), which were higher in the negative group. CSF TAU and P-TAU were significantly correlated with medium and small HDL in the negative group, and with extremely large VLDL in the positive group. Our results also indicated significant correlations of metabolites including unsaturated fatty acids, glycerol, and leucine with CSF core biomarkers. Conclusion: Based on our findings, a number of lipoproteins and metabolites were associated with CSF core biomarkers of AD. These correlations showed some differences in Apo-E epsilon4 positive and negative groups, which reminds the role of Apo-E gene status in the pathophysiology of AD development. However, further research is warranted to explore the exact association of lipoproteins and other metabolites with AD core biomarkers and pathology.
