38966126|t|Preoperative risk evaluation and optimization for patients with liver disease.
38966126|a|The prevalence of liver disease is rising and more patients with liver disease are considered for surgery each year. Liver disease poses many potential complications to surgery; therefore, assessing perioperative risk and optimizing a patient's liver health is necessary to decrease perioperative risk. Multiple scoring tools exist to help quantify perioperative risk and can be used in combination to best educate patients prior to surgery. In this review, we go over the various scoring tools and provide a guide for clinicians to best assess and optimize perioperative risk based on the etiology of liver disease.
