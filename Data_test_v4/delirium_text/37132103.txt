37132103|a|The cannabinoid (CB) signalling cascade is widely located in the human body and is as-sociated with several pathophysiological processes. The endocannabinoid system comprises canna-binoid receptors CB1 and CB2, which belong to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). CB1 recep-tors are primarily located on nerve terminals, prohibiting neurotransmitter release, whereas CB2 are present predominantly on immune cells, causing cytokine release. The activation of CB system con-tributes to the development of several diseases which might have lethal consequences, such as CNS disorders, cancer, obesity, and psychotic disorders on human health. Clinical evidence revealed that CB1 receptors are associated with CNS ailments such as Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, and multiple sclerosis, whereas CB2 receptors are primarily connected with immune disorders, pain, inflammation, etc. Therefore, cannabinoid receptors have been proved to be promising targets in therapeutics and drug discovery. Experimental and clinical outcomes have disclosed the success sto-ry of CB antagonists, and several research groups have framed newer compounds with the binding potential to these receptors. In the presented review, we have summarized variously reported heter-ocycles with CB receptor agonistic/antagonistic properties against CNS disorders, cancer, obesity, and other complications. The structural activity relationship aspects have been keenly described along with enzymatic assay data. The specific outcomes of molecular docking studies have also been highlighted to get insights into the binding patterns of the molecules to CB receptors.
