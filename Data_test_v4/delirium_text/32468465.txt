32468465|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) was first described and diagnosed by Dr. Alois Alzheimer in 1906 (Hippius and Neundorfer, Dialogues Clin Neurosc 5:101-108, 2003). According to World Health Organization (WHO), AD is the most common cause of dementia, accounting for as many as 60-70% of senile dementia cases and affecting 47.5 million people worldwide (data from 2015) (Dementia Fact Sheet No 362. http://who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs362/en/ ). The median survival time after the onset of dementia ranges from 3.3 to 11.7 years (Todd et al. Int J Geriatr Psychiatry 28:1109-1124, 2013). AD is characterized as a severe, chronic, incurable, and progressive neurodegenerative disorder, associated with memory loss and cognition impairment accompanied by abnormal behavior and personality changes (Godyn et al. Pharmacol Rep 68:127-138, 2016). AD is characterized by neuronal death, which usually correlates with the appearance of key neuropathological changes, including acetylcholine deficiency, glutamate excitotoxicity, extracellular deposition of beta-amyloid (Abeta plaques), intracellular neurofibrillary tangles by hyperphosphorylated tau protein deposits, neuroinflammation, and widespread neuronal loss (Godyn et al. Pharmacol Rep 68:127-138, 2016; Graham et al. Annu Rev. Med 68:413-430, 2017). The discovery of the degeneration of cholinergic neurons and the reduction of acetylcholine levels in postmortem studies of patients resulted in the use of drugs that leads to the increase of acetylcholine levels in brain (Dubois et al. Lacet Neurol 13:614-629, 2014). At present there is no preventative or curative treatment that interferes with the development of the disease. However, in recent years progress was made in the development of cholinergic drugs which have a positive effect on disease progression. Nowadays, specific drugs that can inhibit the enzyme that degrades acetylcholine are used. The development of new effective drugs involves a difficult and time-consuming process, accompanied by a very high failure rate. In the absence of effective therapies, the estimated number of people with dementia will reach 115 to 131, five million by 2050 (Dubois et al. Lacet Neurol 13:614-629, 2014; Cummings et al. Alzheimers Res Ther 6:37, 2014). Novel therapies and new targets required for developing more effective drugs for the treatment of AD patients are urgently needed.
