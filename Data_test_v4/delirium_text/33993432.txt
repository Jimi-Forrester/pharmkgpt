33993432|t|Cognitive Dysfunction in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus: Immunopathology, Clinical Manifestations, Neuroimaging and Management.
33993432|a|Cognitive dysfunction (CD) is a common yet often clinically subtle manifestation that considerably impacts the health-related quality of life in patients with systemic lupus erythaematosus (SLE). Given the inconsistencies in CD assessment and challenges in its attribution to SLE, the reported prevalence of CD differs widely, ranging from 3 to 88%. The clinical presentation of CD in SLE is non-specific and may manifest concurrently with overt neuropsychiatric illness such as psychosis or mood disorders or as isolated impairment of attention, working memory, executive dysfunction or processing speed. Despite the lack of standardized and sensitive neuropsychological tests and validated diagnostic biomarkers of CD in SLE, significant progress has been made in identifying pathogenic neural pathways and neuroimaging. Furthermore, several autoantibodies, cytokines, pro-inflammatory mediators and metabolic factors have been implicated in the pathogenesis of CD in SLE. Abrogation of the integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and ensuing autoantibody-mediated neurotoxicity, complement and microglial activation remains the widely accepted mechanism of SLE-related CD. Although several functional neuroimaging modalities have consistently demonstrated abnormalities that correlate with CD in SLE patients, a consensus remains to be reached as to their clinical utility in diagnosing CD. Given the multifactorial aetiology of CD, a multi-domain interventional approach that addresses the risk factors and disease mechanisms of CD in a concurrent fashion is the favourable therapeutic direction. While cognitive rehabilitation and exercise training remain important, specific pharmacological agents that target microglial activation and maintain the BBB integrity are potential candidates for the treatment of SLE-related CD.
