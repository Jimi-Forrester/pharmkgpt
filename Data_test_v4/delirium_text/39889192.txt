39889192|t|Organized chronic subdural hematoma with cognitive impairment: A case report and literature review.
39889192|a|RATIONALE: Organic chronic subdural hematoma is extremely rare in clinical practice, with unclear etiology and pathogenesis. Its clinical manifestations and treatment approaches are diverse, making diagnosis challenging and prone to misdiagnosis or mistreatment, adversely affecting patient care and quality of life. PATIENT CONCERNS: The 58-year-old male patient exhibited cognitive impairment, characterized by memory deficits and delayed responses, over 1 month in the absence of notable medical comorbidities. DIAGNOSES: Initial neurological assessment upon admission showed cognitive deficits, with a Mini-Mental State Examination score of 18 and a Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale score of 22. Imaging with a computed tomography scan revealed a subdural mass with low density. The preoperative diagnosis indicated a chronic subdural hematoma (may combined with intracranial hypertension) located at the apex of the right frontotemporal region, potentially with septation. INTERVENTIONS: A bone flap craniotomy was proceeded under microscopic guidance for lesion resection. Postoperatively, the patient received targeted interventions, including fluid replacement, to promote brain tissue recovery and functional rehabilitation. OUTCOMES: After treatment, the patient demonstrated improvement and was discharged from the hospital. Over the 1-year postoperative period, he reported mild recent memory decline but remained asymptomatic, continued his usual activities, and demonstrated improved cognitive function, as evidenced by Mini-Mental State Examination and Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale scores of 28 and 29, respectively, along with normal muscle strength in all limbs. LESSONS: Patients with mild or no significant symptoms, such as headaches and dizziness, are advised to undergo regular imaging follow-ups. Surgical intervention is recommended for patients presenting with intracranial hypertension and neurological impairment, with bone flap craniotomy and lesion resection under microscopic guidance being the preferred approach. It is imperative to conduct regular postoperative monitoring to promptly detect potential complications, such as hematoma recurrence.
