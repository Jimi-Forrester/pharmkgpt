10773846|a|The development of a rash in response to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) administration is a frequent adverse reaction in people with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). In contrast, there are no published reports in the English language literature describing TMP-SMX induced delirium in an AIDS patient. This report describes the development of frank delirium in a person with AIDS receiving TMP-SMX. The episode resolved completely within 72 h of withdrawal of the drug.
