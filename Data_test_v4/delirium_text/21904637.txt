21904637|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive, neurodegenerative disease of increasing incidence. The pathologic processes that underlie this disorder are incompletely understood, however, hypoperfusion/hypoxia is thought to contribute to disease pathogenesis. Hypoxia inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1alpha), a key regulator of cellular responses to hypoxia, is elevated in the microcirculation of AD patients. Cerebral hypoxia is a potent stimulus for vascular activation and angiogenesis. Microvessels isolated from the brains of AD patients express a large number of angiogenic proteins. Despite considerable data in human tissues regarding vascular expression of hypoxia-related angiogenic proteins, there is little information regarding these proteins in the brain vasculature of transgenic AD mice. The objectives of this study were to determine expression of HIF-1alpha, angiogenic proteins, angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2), and matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2), and survival/apoptotic proteins (Bcl-xL, caspase 3) in the cerebromicrovasculature of AD transgenic mice and to determine the direct effect of hypoxia on cerebral endothelial expression of these proteins in vitro. Cultured brain endothelial cells were subjected to hypoxia for 4-6 h and analyzed by western blot and immunofluorescence. Our results demonstrated that HIF-1alpha is induced in cultured brain endothelial cells exposed to hypoxia and that expression of Ang-2, MMP2 and caspase 3 was elevated and the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL decreased. Brain sections from AD and control mice showed that HIF-1alpha, Ang-2, MMP2 and caspase 3 are elevated and Bcl-xL decreased in the microvasculature of AD mice. These data suggest the cerebromicrovasculature is an important target for the effects of hypoxia in the AD brain.
