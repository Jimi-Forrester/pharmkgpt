33298240|a|The N-myc downstream regulated gene (NDRG) family members are dysregulated in several tumors. Functionally, NDRGs play an important role in the malignant progression of cancer cells. However, little is known about the potential implications of NDRG4 in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). The aim of the current study was to elucidate the expression pattern of NDRG4 in PDAC and evaluate its potential cellular biological effects. Here, we firstly report that epigenetic-mediated silencing of NDRG4 promotes PDAC by regulating mitochondrial function. Data mining demonstrated that NDRG4 was significantly down-regulated in PDAC tissues and cells. PDAC patients with low NDRG4 expression showed poor prognosis. Epigenetic regulation by DNA methylation was closely associated with NDRG4 down-regulation. NDRG4 overexpression dramatically suppressed PDAC cell growth and metastasis. Further functional analysis demonstrated that up-regulated NDRG4 in SW1990 and Canpan1 cells resulted in attenuated mitochondrial function, including reduced ATP production, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, and increased fragmented mitochondria. However, opposite results were obtained for HPNE cells with NDRG4 knockdown. These results indicate that hypermethylation-driven silencing of NDRG4 can promote PDAC by regulating mitochondrial function and that NDRG4 could be as a potential biomarker for PDAC patients.
