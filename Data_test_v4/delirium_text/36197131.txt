36197131|t|Alzheimer disease and the evolving treatment landscape.
36197131|a|Alzheimer disease (AD) is an irreversible, progressive neurodegenerative disorder that destroys memory and the ability to think, slowly over time. AD is the leading type of dementia, accounting for 60% to 80% of cases, and the sixth leading cause of death in the United States. AD, which can range from mild to severe, is thought to occur secondary to the aggregation and accumulation of beta-amyloid peptides, abnormal phosphorylation of tau protein, and neuroinflammation. Current treatment options vary depending on the severity of AD, and emerging treatment options continue to arise. Managed care organizations are in an excellent position to implement viable patient care ecosystems to support patients and caregivers in decreasing AD progression and its consequences. Vigilance in identifying AD and providing early treatment is crucial to improving patient outcomes and burden of disease on patients, caregivers, and health systems.
