16792151|a|The aim of this study was to evaluate if the prescriptions of anticholinesterase drugs took into account some diseases and drugs which could interfere with them, in 58 inpatients (82 years old). The anticholinesterase drugs were respectively at admission and discharge: donepezil (n = 27 and 34), galantamine (n = 12 and 19) and rivastigmine (n = 3 and 1). Nineteen patients received a combination of anticholinesterase drug with an anticholinergic drug (muscarinic antipsychotic 15 times). Twelve patients had a medical history which interfered with the anticholinesterase drug: uretroprostatic obstacle, chronic renal failure and auriculo-ventricular block. Thirty-five adverse drug reactions, mainly in digestive track, were recorded in 26 patients. The treatment with anticholinesterase drug was modified only in 18 patients and the combination of anticholinesterase drug and antipsychotic agent was stopped in 5 patients. In conclusion, inappropriated prescriptions of anticholinesterase drugs seem frequent, with a more important prevalence of adverse drug reactions than in prospective studies. These results incite to develop studies of evaluation of prescriptions of anticholinesterase drugs.
