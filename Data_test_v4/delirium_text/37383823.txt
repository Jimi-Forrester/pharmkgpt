37383823|t|Brain electrophysiological recording during olfactory stimulation in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer disease patients: An EEG dataset.
37383823|a|The dataset presented in this article contains preprocessed cleaned electroencephalography (EEG) recording from 35 participants including 13 Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, 7 amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) patients, and 15 healthy elderly. All participants performed the same olfactory task which consisted of 120 trials of 2 s olfactory stimulation and 8 s rest (no odorant). The olfactory stimulation consisted of rose and lemon odorants. Odor trials were presented randomly with a probability of 0.75 presenting lemon and 0.25 presenting rose. The impedance of the electrodes was kept under 15 KOmega during the experiment. The data was filtered from 0.5 to 40 Hz using a bandpass filter and epoched from 1 s pre-stimulus to 2 s post-stimulus. Artifacts related to eye blinks were removed by running independent component analysis (ICA) and the remaining noisy trials were identified by eye and removed from further analysis. Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) test scores for all participants are also provided in the dataset. Olfactory dysfunction has been shown to be associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, studying the response of the olfactory system may lead to identifying early biomarkers for related brain disorders.
