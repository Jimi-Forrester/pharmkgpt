Although orthopedic-related incidence of postoperative ileus is about 10%, these studies are limited to spine surgery and pelvic surgery. The purpose of this study was to investigate prevalence of POI and to analyze effect of chewing gum on POI and bowel function in elderly patients after hip fracture surgery.A prospective randomized controlled trial was conducted at the Gyeongsang National University Hospital. Elderly patients with hip fracture who underwent surgery from March 2017 to June 2018 were eligible to participate. Patients were excluded if they had a mastication disability, impaired cognitive function, previous history of gastrointestinal disease, respiratory disease and low oxygen saturation, hip arthroplasty with causes other than hip fractures, acetabular fractures, periprosthetic fractures, or pathological fractures. Patients with consciousness problem by excessive anesthesia were also excluded. Patients were classified into 2 groups by randomization. Group I received sugar-free gum and were encouraged to chew 6 hours following surgery until the first intestinal gas is released. Group II was given the same postoperative procedure and encouraged to consume water after 6 hours.After applying exclusion criteria, 74 patients were finally included. Thirty-one patients were classified to Group I and 43 patients were classified to the Group II. Prevalence of POI in all patients with hip fracture was 63.5% (47/74). Prevalence of POI in Group I was statistically significant lower than that in Group II (Group I: 41%, Group II: 79.1%, P = .01)The prevalence of POI in elderly patients with hip fracture was 63.5%. Chewing gum had a significant effect on reduction of POI in elderly patients with hip fractures.
