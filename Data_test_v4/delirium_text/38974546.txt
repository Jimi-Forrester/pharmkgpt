38974546|t|Rare presentation of Kluver-Bucy syndrome following subarachnoid hemorrhage.
38974546|a|Background: Kluver-Bucy syndrome (KBS) is a rare neuropsychiatric disorder, and it can be associated with a variety of neurological disorders. It is characterized by visual agnosia, placidity, hyperorality, hypersexuality, dietary changes, amnesia, and hypermetamorphosis. KBS is mainly a clinical diagnosis, with at least three symptoms sufficient to diagnose the condition. Case Description: The case describes a 49-year-old Filipino woman with a history of hypertension who presented with symptoms strongly suggesting KBS following subarachnoid hemorrhage, including behaviors such as hyperorality, hypermobility, placidity, hypermetamorphosis, and hypersexuality along with memory disturbance. She was managed as a case of brief psychotic disorder initially with olanzapine, then on the second presentation as a case of delirium with risperidone. Conclusion: Among many symptoms of KBS, only three symptoms are required for the diagnosis clinically. Numerous neurological conditions can cause KBS. Symptomatic treatment is the mainstream treatment currently for KBS.[3] While different differential diagnoses are present, neurologists, psychiatrists, neurosurgeons, and radiologists should collaborate and be vigilant for the diagnosis of KBS, especially with the presence of one of its etiologies.
