27714460|a|It has been known since the eighteenth century that postpartum psychoses can begin several weeks after childbirth, not during the first fortnight. There are almost 400 non-organic episodes in the literature, starting more than 3 weeks after the birth; some of them are recurrent. The distinction of this disorder from early onset puerperal psychosis is supported by the distribution of onsets (which shows a steep fall after 14-15 days), survey data and the association with later pregnancies, not the first. Marce believed that these late onsets were related to the resumption of menstruation. This is a hypothesis worth investigating.
