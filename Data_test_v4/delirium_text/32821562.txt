32821562|t|A Case Report on Endovascular Aortic Repair Rupture.
32821562|a|Endovascular repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a widely accepted alternative to open surgical AAA repair. A ruptured AAA is among the emergency surgeries with the highest risk of death, with an overall mortality rate close to90%. However, the classic symptom triad for ruptured AAAs of hypotension, a pulsatile mass, and abdominal/back pain is seen in only in 25% to 50% of affected patients. Thus, many present with symptoms and signs that suggest adifferent diagnosis. Recognizing uncommon presentations and limitations of imaging and interpretation, in addition to clinical gestalt, can save many lives. This report discusses an unusual case involving a previously repaired AAA presenting with acute rupture at the endograft site.
