35605597|t|Survey Results of Speech-Language Pathologists Working With Cognitive-Communication Disorders: Improving Practices for Mild Cognitive Impairment and Early-Stage Dementia From Alzheimer's Disease.
35605597|a|PURPOSE: As the incidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) continues to rise, there is a need for interventions that focus on risk reduction and early disease management. Speech-language pathologists (SLPs) can contribute to risk reduction efforts and deliver cognitive interventions; however, the nature and frequency of current clinical practice in those areas is unclear. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to conduct an exploratory survey of the cognitive-communication practices and needs of SLPs for adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early-stage dementia from AD, to inform future research and clinical training efforts. METHOD: SLPs completed an online survey that assessed five areas of practice specific to cognitive-communication and MCI and early-stage dementia: (a) education and training, (b) MCI subtype knowledge and consideration, (c) goals and treatment practices, (d) assessment of everyday living skills, and (e) general clinical practices and needs. RESULTS: One hundred fifty-seven SLPs completed the survey and represented a range of practice experience. Results revealed a discrepancy between the number of SLPs who provide services to adults with MCI or early-stage dementia and those who have received formal training to do so, suggesting a reliance on clinical practice experience. Participants primarily reported using interview and informal methods to assess daily activities and often described using compensatory-based treatments. CONCLUSIONS: These findings contribute to the limited knowledge about SLPs' cognitive-communication practices to help improve early-disease management for AD, a rapidly growing population in need of SLPs' services. More research is needed to support SLPs in being maximally effective when working with clients early in the AD continuum. SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL: https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.19787728.
