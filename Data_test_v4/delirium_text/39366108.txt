39366108|a|Mitochondrial dysfunction in microglia has been implicated as a key pathogenesis of most neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Abnormal production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and neuroinflammation caused by mitochondrial oxidative stress are important factors leading to neuronal death in AD. Herein, a "dual brake" strategy to synergistically halt mitochondrial dysfunction and neuroinflammation targeting mitochondria in microglia is proposed. To achieve this goal, (3-carboxypropyl) triphenyl-phosphonium bromide (TPP)-modified Cu2-xSe nanozymes (Cu2-xSe-TPP NPs) with dual enzyme-like activities was designed. Cu2-xSe-TPP NPs with superoxide dismutase-mimetic (SOD) and catalase-mimetic (CAT) activities can effectively scavenge ROS in the mitochondria of microglia and relieve mitochondrial oxidative stress. In vivo studies demonstrated that Cu2-xSe-TPP NPs can alleviate oxidative stress and promote neuroprotection in the hippocampus of AD model mice. In addition, Cu2-xSe-TPP NPs can regulate the polarization of microglia from the pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype to the anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype, promote Abeta phagocytosis and reshape the AD inflammatory microenvironment, thus effectively attenuating AD neuropathology and rescuing cognitive deficits in AD model mice. Taken together, this strategy preventing mitochondrial damage and remodeling the inflammatory microenvironment will provide a new perspective for AD therapy.
