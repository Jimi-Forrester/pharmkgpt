33199094|t|Contemporary Mortality Rate and Outcomes in Nonagenarians Undergoing Primary Total Hip Arthroplasty.
33199094|a|BACKGROUND: Nonagenarians (90-99 years) have experienced the fastest percent growth in primary THA utilization recently. However, there are limited data on this population. This study aimed to determine the mortality rate, implant survivorship, clinical outcomes, and complications of primary THAs in nonagenarians. METHODS: Our institutional total joint registry was used to identify 144 nonagenarians who underwent 149 primary THAs for osteoarthritis only between 1997 and 2017. The mean age was 92 years, with 63% being female. Mortality, revision, and reoperation were assessed using cumulative incidence with death as a competing risk and Cox regression methods. Clinical outcomes were assessed using Harris hip scores (HHSs). Cemented femoral components were used in 68%. The mean follow-up was 4 years. RESULTS: The mortality rates were 6%, 8%, 14%, and 49% at 90 days, 1 year, 2 years, and 5 years, respectively. The 5-year cumulative incidences of any revision and reoperation were 1% and 4%, respectively. The mean HHS improved significantly from 48 preoperatively to 76 at 5 years (P < .001). The 5-year cumulative incidence of any complication was 69%, with the most common being periprosthetic femur fracture (7) intraoperatively, delirium (25) early postoperatively, and periprosthetic femur fracture (10) later postoperatively. Uncemented stem fixation was associated with a higher risk for intraoperative femur fracture (Hazard ratio 5, P = .04) but not with a higher 5-year periprosthetic postoperative femur fracture risk (P = .19). CONCLUSION: Nonagenarians undergoing primary THA had substantial mortality rates at 90 days (6%) and 1 year (8%). While the cumulative incidence of any revision and reoperations were low at 5 years, the high complication rate is mostly due to periprosthetic fractures. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, retrospective cohort.
