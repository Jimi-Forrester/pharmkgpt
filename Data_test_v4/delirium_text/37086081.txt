37086081|t|CRTC1 is a potential target to delay aging-induced cognitive deficit by protecting the integrity of the blood-brain barrier via inhibiting inflammation.
37086081|a|Aging can cause attenuation in the functioning of multiple organs, and blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown could promote the occurrence of disorders of the central nervous system during aging. Since inflammation is considered to be an important factor underlying BBB injury during aging, vascular endothelial cell senescence serves as a critical pathological basis for the destruction of BBB integrity. In the current review, we have first introduced the concepts related to aging-induced cognitive deficit and BBB integrity damage. Thereafter, we reviewed the potential relationship between disruption of BBB integrity and cognition deficit and the role of inflammation, vascular endothelial cell senescence, and BBB injury. We have also briefly introduced the function of CREB-regulated transcription co-activator 1 (CRTC1) in cognition and aging-induced CRTC1 changes as well as the critical roles of CRTC1/cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in regulating inflammation, endothelial cell senescence, and BBB injury. Finally, the underlying mechanisms have been summarized and we propose that CRTC1 could be a promising target to delay aging-induced cognitive deficit by protecting the integrity of BBB through promoting inhibition of inflammation-mediated endothelial cell senescence.
