39108367|t|Awareness level of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus among health-care providers.
39108367|a|Background: Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) is a disease that primarily affects the geriatric population. It was first introduced by Adams et al. in 1965. A gradual decline in cognitive function, urinary incontinence, and gait disturbances characterizes the disease. This condition is believed to be underdiagnosed, and awareness of such pathology is vital, as the treatment is very effective and can reverse the symptoms. Methods: This questionnaire-based cross-sectional study aimed to assess awareness levels regarding iNPH among non-neuroscience healthcare providers in Saudi Arabia. Results: A total of 269 healthcare providers participated in this study, with data collected through an online questionnaire. About 80.6% of the participants had heard of the disease, while 56.5% were aware of the disease symptomology. About 50% of physicians did not encounter iNPH patients in clinical practice. Previous clinical exposure to iNPH patients correlates significantly with an awareness of disease symptoms, investigation, treatment modalities, and outcome. Clinical experience positively impacts physicians' awareness as it correlates with a better understanding of diagnostic methods and disease outcomes. Conclusion: The study highlights the need for targeted educational interventions, especially among family physicians and general practitioners with no previous experience with iNPH patients, as well as interdisciplinary collaboration to address gaps in awareness and enhance early diagnosis of iNPH patients.
