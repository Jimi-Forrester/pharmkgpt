36636271|t|Multiple Dural Arteriovenous Fistulas as the Mystery of Rapidly Progressive Dementia with Bilateral Thalamic Lesions.
36636271|a|Dementia is a gradual and irreversible loss of higher mental function, particularly memory. Dural arteriovenous fistulas (DAVFs) are one of the rare causes of a rapid decline in cognitive function, which can be curable. DAVFs are pathological shunts between the dural artery and the dural venous sinus, dural vein, or cortical vein. Here, we present a case that initially manifested nausea and dizziness and developed rapidly progressive dementia caused by DAVFs in the left transverse sinus-sigmoid sinus junction area and the sinus confluence area, combined with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. Moreover, our case has multiple DAVFs that cause bilateral thalamic lesions and rapidly progressive dementia called thalamic dementia, which is infrequent and often misdiagnosed. His symptoms have improved after receiving endovascular embolization treatment. In addition to presenting our case, we conducted a systemic literature review to summarize how familiarity with the manifestation and early diagnosis of bilateral thalamic lesions caused by DAVFs can lead to earlier and more effective therapy.
