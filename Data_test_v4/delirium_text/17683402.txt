17683402|t|Ketamine is effective in decreasing the incidence of emergence agitation in children undergoing dental repair under sevoflurane general anesthesia.
17683402|a|BACKGROUND: Emergence agitation or delirium is a known phenomenon that may occur in children undergoing general anesthesia with inhaled agents. Our aim was to test the hypothesis that the addition of a small dose of ketamine at the end of sevoflurane anesthesia will result in a decrease in the incidence and severity of such phenomenon. METHODS: We performed a randomized double blind study involving 85 premedicated children 4-7 years old undergoing dental repair. Children were premedicated with acetaminophen and midazolam. Anesthesia was induced and maintained with sevoflurane in N2O/O2. Group K received ketamine 0.25 mg.kg (-1) and Group S received saline. We evaluated recovery characteristics upon awakening and during the first 30 min using the Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium scale. RESULTS: Eighty of the 85 enrolled children completed the study. There were 42 children in Group I. Emergence agitation was diagnosed in seven children in the ketamine group (16.6%) and in 13 children in the placebo group (34.2%). There was no difference in time to meet recovery room discharge criteria between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the addition of ketamine 0.25 mg.kg(-1) can decrease the incidence of emergence agitation in children after sevoflurane general anesthesia.
