32276477|t|The Aqueous Extract from Ceratonia siliqua Leaves Protects Against 6-hydroxydopamine in Zebrafish: Understanding the Underlying Mechanism.
32276477|a|Ceratonia siliqua L. is a Mediterranean medicinal plant traditionally cultivated for its ethnopharmacological benefits, such as antidiarrheal, antidiabetic, enhance acetylcholine, antioxidant, antiatherosclerotic, and for its possible anti-neurodegenerative potential. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the chemical composition, as well as the cognitive-enhancing, anxiolytic, and antioxidant activities of the aqueous extract from C. siliqua (CsAE) leaves against 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) zebrafish Parkinson's disease (PD) model. CsAE (0.1, 0.3, and 1 mg/L) was administered by immersion to zebrafish (Danio rerio) for eight consecutive days and one hour before each behavioral test of each day, while 6-OHDA (250 microM) treatment was supplied one day before the novel tank diving test (NTT). Qualitative and quantitative analyses were performed by the ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) analysis. The memory performance was evaluated through the NTT and Y-maze tests. Additionally, the in vitro and in vivo antioxidant status and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity was also assessed. Our finds demonstrated that CsAE presented positive antioxidant and anti-AChE activities, which contributed to the improvement of cognitive function in the 6-OHDA zebrafish PD model.
