35446723|t|Apathy as a Predictor for Conversion From Mild Cognitive Impairment to Dementia: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Longitudinal Studies.
35446723|a|BACKGROUND: Apathy is one of the most prevalent neurobehavioral manifestations in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and is included among the behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). Studies suggest that the presence of apathy could be associated with increased dementia risk. The role of apathy in conversion from MCI to dementia, and whether apathy could be a relevant predictor for dementia progression, are still matters of investigation. AIM: To study the relationship between apathy and progression to dementia in individuals with MCI. METHODS: A systematic literature search in Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, Epistemonikos, PsychINFO, and CINAHL was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. The search included longitudinal studies reporting on the association between apathy and dementia. RESULTS: The main outcome was pooled unadjusted hazard ratios (HR) of apathy in dementia conversion and included 11 studies with 9504 individuals. There was a significant association between apathy and dementia conversion, HR = 1.54; 95% CI, 1.29, 1.84. Subgroup analysis showed a significant association between apathy and progression to AD. CONCLUSION: Apathy was associated with an increased risk of conversion to AD and all-cause dementia in patients with MCI. The role of apathy as a marker for incident dementia needs to be investigated in large, high-quality studies.
