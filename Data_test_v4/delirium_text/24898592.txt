24898592|t|[Delirium].
24898592|a|Delirium in older patients is also associated with persistent functional and cognitive impairment. Nevertheless, it frequently remains unrecognized or misinterpreted by treating physicians and this is particularly true in cases of hypoactive delirium. Screening and assessment instruments are helpful in the identification of patients with delirium. A multifactorial model of a combination of predisposing and precipitating factors best explains the etiology of delirium and avoidance is crucial for its prevention. Whenever delirium is suspected, immediate diagnosis and therapy of the precipitating condition are of primary importance. Non-pharmacological interventions, for example environmental modifications, play an important role in managing behavioral symptoms of delirium. Pharmacological interventions are merely symptomatic and should be limited to patients with severe symptoms when non-pharmacological means fail.
