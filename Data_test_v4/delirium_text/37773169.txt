37773169|a|The interaction between cerebral endothelial cells (CEC) and brain parenchymal cells is critical to maintain neurovascular homeostasis, whereas extracellular vesicles (EVs) are essential to mediate the cell-cell communication. Previous researches demonstrated that CEC-derived EVs (CEC-EVs) confer neuroprotective actions. However, the molecular mechanisms remain unknown. In this study, we isolated EVs from CEC and assessed their immune-regulatory actions in microglial cells and mice following lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure. We found that CEC-EVs treatment significantly ameliorated LPS-induced inflammatory activation, shifting microglial polarization from pro-inflammatory phenotype to anti-inflammatory phenotype. Meanwhile, microglial cells can effectively internalize CEC-EVs and this process was further enhanced by immune activation. Next, the miRNA microarray analysis revealed that CEC-EVs increased expression of miR-672-5p, which was demonstrated to be the cargo of CEC-EVs. TGFbeta-activated kinase 1 (TAK1)-binding proteins 2 (TAB2) was identified to be the target of miR-672-5p. Through inhibiting TAB2, miR-672-5p derived from CEC-EVs suppressed TAK1-TAB signaling and thereby mitigating the downstream NF-kappaB activation. Furthermore, we found that by delivering miR-672-5p, CEC-EVs promoted autophagy and hence stimulating autophagic degradation of NLRP3 inflammasome. Our work firstly revealed the neuroimmune-modulating actions of CEC-EVs and further demonstrated that miR-672-5p secreted from CEC-EVs inhibits microglial pro-inflammatory polarization and facilitates autophagic process via targeting TAB2.
