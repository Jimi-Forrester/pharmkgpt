36700922|a|AIM: To describe nurses' roles, involvement, and topics in shared decision-making with older patients with dementia in acute hospitals. DESIGN: An integrative review. METHODS: A systematic search was performed until April 2022 in PubMed, PsychInfo, CINAHL, and Cochrane, followed by a manual search on the reference lists of relevant systematic reviews. Studies were independently screened, appraised using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodology, and extracted by two reviewers. RESULTS: Nine studies were included. Nurses were involved as treatment team members, intermediates, or patient supporters. Nurses' roles were most explicit in the preparatory phase of shared decision-making. The step of 'developing tailor-made options' was limitedly identified. 'Deliberating and trying options to reach a decision' were described from an outsider's perspective in which nurses attempted to influence the decision. In conclusion, nurses primarily have a role in decision-making by supplementing patient information. Patient and Public Contribution No Patient or Public Contribution.
