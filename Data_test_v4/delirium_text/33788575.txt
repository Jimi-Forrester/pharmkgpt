33788575|a|The dependence of neurons on microtubule-based motors for the movement of lysosomes over long distances raises questions about adaptations that allow neurons to meet these demands. Recently, JIP3/MAPK8IP3, a neuronally enriched putative adaptor between lysosomes and motors, was identified as a critical regulator of axonal lysosome abundance. In this study, we establish a human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neuron model for the investigation of axonal lysosome transport and maturation and show that loss of JIP3 results in the accumulation of axonal lysosomes and the Alzheimer's disease-related amyloid precursor protein (APP)-derived Abeta42 peptide. We furthermore reveal an overlapping role of the homologous JIP4 gene in lysosome axonal transport. These results establish a cellular model for investigating the relationship between lysosome axonal transport and amyloidogenic APP processing and more broadly demonstrate the utility of human iPSC-derived neurons for the investigation of neuronal cell biology and pathology.
