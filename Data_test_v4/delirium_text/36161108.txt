36161108|t|Effect of Mediterranean diet and Mediterranean diet plus calorie restriction on cognition, lifestyle, and cardiometabolic health: A randomized clinical trial.
36161108|a|A Mediterranean diet and intentional weight loss each positively affect cognitive functioning. Combining both could produce synergistic effects on cognition. The purpose of this study is to compare a Mediterranean diet lifestyle intervention with and without caloric restriction versus control on cognition, lifestyle, and cardiometabolic disease. In a three-arm trial conducted between 2017 and 2020 in Chicago, one hundred and eight-five, 55-85-year-old, predominately non-Hispanic black females with obesity were randomized (2:2:1) to an 8-month Mediterranean diet plus caloric restriction intervention, Mediterranean diet alone, or control. The primary outcome was change from baseline to post-intervention in cognitive composite scores: attention, information & processing; executive function; and learning, memory, & recognition. Secondary outcomes were weight, lifestyle and cardiometabolic markers. The 8-month Mediterranean diet interventions did not significantly affect cognition. Adherence to a Mediterranean diet improved more in the Mediterranean diet plus caloric restriction arm (mean [SE] score change, +6.3 [0.7] points) and Mediterranean diet alone arm (+4.8 [0.7] points) relative to controls (+0.6 [0.9] points). Mean weight loss was greater among the Mediterranean diet plus caloric restriction arm (-4.6 [0.6] kg) compared to the Mediterranean diet alone (-2.6 [0.6] kg) and control arms (-0.6 [0.7] kg). The interventions did not affect activity or cardiometabolic risk markers; although, fasting insulin did decline in the Mediterranean diet plus caloric restriction arm relative to the Mediterranean diet alone and control arms. A Mediterranean diet lifestyle intervention with and without caloric restriction did not significantly affect cognitive function compared to controls. The Mediterranean diet interventions, however, significantly affected diet quality and body weight.
