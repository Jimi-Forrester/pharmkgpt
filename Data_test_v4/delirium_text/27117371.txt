27117371|a|OBJECTIVE: To discuss the influence factors of dislocation after bipolar prosthetic replacement. METHODS: A total of 374 patients who received bipolar prosthetic replacement in our hospital from October 2001 to October 2015 were retrospectively studied. The clinic data of patients with dislocation after operation was summarized to analyze the causes. RESULTS: Dislocation happened in 12 patients among all the 374 patients.10 cases received manual relocation, 2 cases open relocation. Most of the 12 patients were accompanied with neurological and psychiatric disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, sequelae of cerebral infarction, etc. Some factors like improper body position caused by these complications were the main influence factors of dislocation. CONCLUSION: Accompanied with neurological and psychiatric disorders is the important influence factor of dislocation after bipolar prosthetic replacement.
