35001356|t|MicroRNAs in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease: an overview.
35001356|a|Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by a progressive loss of neurons of the central nervous system (CNS) and serve as a major cause of morbidity, mortality and functional dependence especially among the elderly. Despite extensive research and development efforts, the success rate of clinical pipelines has been very limited. However, microRNAs (miRs) have been proved to be of crucial importance in regulating intracellular pathways for various pathologic conditions including those of a neurodegenerative nature. There is ample evidence of altered levels of various miRs in clinical samples of Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease patients with potentially major clinical implications. In the current review, we aim to summarize the relevant literature on the role of miRs in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) as the two globally predominant neurodegenerative conditions.
