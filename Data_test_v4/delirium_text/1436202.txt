1436202|a|A retrospective analysis of the medical charts of 117 patients (50 men and 67 women) with multi-infarct dementia took place. All patients admitted to the psychogeriatric nursing home 'Joachim en Anna' in Nijmegen between 1980 and 1989 were studied. The aim of the study was to obtain epidemiological information and to investigate the prevalence of comorbid conditions, prognosis and mortality. The results were compared with patients with Alzheimer's disease. The patients remained in the institute for 1.4 years and the mean total duration of the disease was 5.3 years. About twenty-five percent died in the first three months of admission. Life expectation, counted from time of admission, was 6 years shorter in comparison with Dutch mortality tables. Morbidity frequently seen at admission included circulatory system diseases and cerebrovascular accidents. The risk factor hypertension was seen in a smaller percentage of patients than expected. During the stay the diseases most frequently diagnosed were respiratory and urinary tract infections, adverse effects of drugs, constipation and chronic ulcers of the skin. About twenty percent of the patients were struck by a (recurrent) cerebrovascular accident or a transient ischaemic attack. Most patients died of dehydration or bronchopneumonia. There was, apart from the diagnosis of multi-infarct dementia, no single patient aspect that could predict a poor prognosis. Nursing home patients with multi-infarct dementia are clearly different from patients with Alzheimer's disease. Time spent in the nursing home and duration of disease are shorter. They have more comorbid conditions, especially of a cardiovascular nature, and they have a poor life expectation.
