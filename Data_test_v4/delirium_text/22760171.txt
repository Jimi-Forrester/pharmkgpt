22760171|a|Here we investigated the effect of the rivastigmine patch alone on depression in 50 mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients with comorbid major depressive episode (MDE). First diagnosis acetyl-cholinesterase inhibitor and psychoactive drug-free outpatients (n=50) were recruited in memory clinics and reassessed after 3 and 6 months. Global cognitive functioning, depressive symptoms and MDE frequency were evaluated with the Mini Mental State Examination, the CERAD Dysphoria scale and the modified DSM-IV criteria for MDE in AD. MDE frequency reduced significantly from the first diagnostic visit (100%) to the 6-month follow-up (62%). We also found a significant reduction in CERAD Dysphoria scores that decreased from 6.2+-3.9 mean+-standard deviation to 4.9+-4.5 at the 6-month follow-up. In AD patients with MDE rivastigmine alone can have a positive impact on depressive phenomena. Thus, future controlled study are justified to definitively verify if rivastigmine alone may improve depression in AD.
