37001735|t|The pathomimetic oAbeta25-35 model of Alzheimer's disease: Potential for screening of new therapeutic agents.
37001735|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia in the elderly, currently affecting more than 40 million people worldwide. The two main histopathological hallmarks of AD were identified in the 1980s: senile plaques (composed of aggregated amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides) and neurofibrillary tangles (composed of hyperphosphorylated tau protein). In the human brain, both Abeta and tau show aggregation into soluble and insoluble oligomers. Soluble oligomers of Abeta include their most predominant forms - Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42 - as well as shorter peptides such as Abeta25-35 or Abeta25-35/40. Most animal models of AD have been developed using transgenesis, based on identified human mutations. However, these familial forms of AD represent less than 1% of AD cases. In this context, the idea emerged in the 1990s to directly inject the Abeta25-35 fragment into the rodent brain to develop an acute model of AD that could mimic the disease's sporadic forms (99% of all cases). This review aims to: (1) summarize the biological activity of Abeta25-35, focusing on its impact on the main structural and functional alterations observed in AD (cognitive deficits, APP misprocessing, tau system dysfunction, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, cholinergic and glutamatergic alterations, HPA axis dysregulation, synaptic deficits and cell death); and (2) confirm the interest of this pathomimetic model in AD research, as it has helped identify and characterize many molecules (marketed, in clinical development, and in preclinical testing), and to the development of alternative approaches for AD prevention and therapy. Today, the Abeta25-35 model appears as a first-intent choice model to rapidly screen the symptomatic or neuroprotective potencies of new compounds, chemical series, or innovative therapeutic strategies.
