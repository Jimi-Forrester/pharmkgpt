22195685|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) and bronchial asthma are common diseases in elderly patients. Untreated chronic diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, diabetes, heart failure, and asthma can be associated with declining cognitive function. The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of asthma therapy performed according to Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines (GINA. Global strategy for asthma management and prevention. Report. Available online at http://www.ginasthma.com/Guidelineitem.asp??l1=2&l2=1&intId=60 last accessed Oct. 2009) on cognitive function and functional status in patients diagnosed with AD. A total of 302 participants who were diagnosed with bronchial asthma and mild or moderate AD (138 women and 164 men) with a mean age of 68.2 +- 5.1 years were included in the study. Cognitive function was assessed based on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the clock drawing test at the beginning of the study, after 6 months, and after 1 year. Results were compared with a control group of patients with AD but not asthma. Several patients (68.9%) had uncontrolled asthma (confirmed at the beginning of the study) and AD. After 1 year of antiasthmatic treatment, the mean MMSE score increased significantly from the baseline values of 17.2 +- 3.2 to 19.5 +- 2.1 (mean +- SD; p < 0.05). This change was significant compared with the control group. Significant improvement in instrumental activity was observed after 1 year of treatment in patients with asthma. Finally, 63.6% of patients met the criteria of well-controlled asthma. Adequate treatment of chronic asthma could improve some cognitive and instrumental activities. Asthma in patients with AD is commonly underdiagnosed and undertreated.
