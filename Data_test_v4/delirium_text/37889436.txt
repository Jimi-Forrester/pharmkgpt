37889436|t|A Population-Based Outcome-Wide Association Study of the Comorbidities and Sequelae Following COVID-19 Infection.
37889436|a|BACKGROUND: Immense attention has been given to the outcome of COVID-19 infection. However, comprehensive studies based on large populational cohort with long-term follow-up are still lacking. This study aimed to investigate the risk of various short-term comorbidities (within one month) and long-term sequelae (above one month) after COVID-19 infection. METHODS: In this large prospective cohort study with 14 months follow-up information based on UK biobank, we included 16,776 COVID-19-positive participants and 58,281 COVID-19-negative participants matched for comparison. The risk of each comorbidity and sequela was evaluated by multivariable logistic regression analysis and presented as hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI). RESULTS: COVID-19-positive individuals had a higher risk of 47 types of comorbidities within one month following COVID-19 infection, especially those who were older, male, overweight/obese, ever-smoked, with more pre-existing comorbidities and hospitalized. About 70.37% of COVID-19 patients with comorbidities had more than one co-occurring comorbidities. Additionally, only 6 high-risk sequelae were observed after one month of COVID-19 infection, and the incidence was relatively low (< 1%). CONCLUSION: In addition to long-term sequelae following COVID-19 infection, plenty of comorbidities were observed, especially in patients with older age, male gender, overweight/obese, more pre-existing comorbidities and severe COVID-19, indicating that more attention should be given to these susceptible persons within this period.
