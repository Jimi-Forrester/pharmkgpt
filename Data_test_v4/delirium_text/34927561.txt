34927561|a|OBJECTIVE: There is concern that high iron uptake during the critical period of early brain development carries potential risks, especially for nonanemic infants. This study examined the neurocognitive functioning of 16-year-olds who were nonanemic as infants and received iron supplementation. METHODS: We studied 562 Chilean adolescents (M 16.2 years; 52.7% female) who participated in a randomized controlled iron supplementation trial in infancy. Between 6 and 12 months, 346 consumed an iron-fortified formula (12.7 Fe mg/L) or, if primarily breastfed, liquid vitamins with 15 mg elemental iron as ferrous sulfate, and 216 consumed unmodified cow milk without iron or liquid vitamins without iron if primarily breastfed. RESULTS: Compared to adolescents in the no-added iron condition in infancy, those in the iron-supplemented condition had poorer visual-motor integration, quantitative reasoning skills, and incurred more errors on neurocognitive tasks. Consuming larger amounts of iron-fortified formula in infancy was associated with lower arithmetic achievement. Of adolescents who had high hemoglobin at 6 months (Hb >= 125 g/L), those in the iron supplemented condition had poorer performance on arithmetic, quantitative reasoning, and response inhibition tests than those in the no-added iron condition. Of adolescents who had marginally low 6-month hemoglobin (Hb > 100 and < 110 g/L), those who received no-added iron incurred more errors on a visual searching task than those in the iron-supplemented condition. CONCLUSION: The physiologic need for iron during the period of rapid and critical brain development in young infants should be considered vis-a-vis the risks associated with supplementing nonanemic infants with high levels of iron.Clinical Trials number: NCT01166451.
