32657055|a|Considerable progress has been made in treatments for multiple sclerosis (MS) and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) over the last several decades. However, the present treatments do not show satisfactory efficacy or safety in a considerable proportion of patients, who experience relapse or disability progression despite receiving treatment and suffer from side effects, which can be severe. Improvements in the understanding of the pathophysiologies of MS and NMOSD have led to numerous therapeutic approaches being proposed and developed. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are receiving increasing attention because of their specificity of action and likelihood of high efficacy with fewer side effects. Many mAbs have been evaluated, and some have been approved for MS or NMOSD treatment. This article reviews the use of mAbs for treating MS and NMOSD, including summarizing their mechanisms of action, efficacy, and safety profiles.
