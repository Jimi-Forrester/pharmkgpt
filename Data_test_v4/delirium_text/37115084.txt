37115084|a|Surgical treatment for patients with Parkinson disease (PD) under general anesthesia has become frequent. PD is a significant predictor of postoperative complications. However, the factors that predict complications in patients with PD remain unknown. We retrospectively recruited patients with PD who underwent surgery between April 2015 and March 2019. The prevalence of postoperative complications was analyzed. We compared the patient characteristics, medical data, and surgical data between patients with and without postoperative complications. We also estimated the odds ratios (OR) for postoperative complications in patients with PD who underwent surgery. Sixty-five patients were enrolled. Eighteen patients presented with 22 complications, including urinary tract infections (UTI) (n = 3; 5%), pneumonia (n = 1; 2%), surgical site infections (SSI) (n = 3; 5%), postoperative delirium (POD) (n = 7; 10%), and others (n = 8; 12%). Four patients presented with 2 complications each. The operation time, the red blood cell transfusion and the rate of rotigotine usage were higher in patients with complications than those without (314 +- 197 min vs 173 +- 145 min, P = .006; 0 [0-560] mL vs 0 [0-0] mL, P = .02; 39% vs 6%, P = .003, respectively) (mean +- standard deviation or median [interquartile range]). Preoperative rotigotine usage (OR: 9.33; 95% confidential interval [CI]: 2.07-42.07; P = .004) was an independent risk factors for postoperative complications. The findings indicate that clinicians should closely monitor postoperative complications when patients with PD who have received transdermal dopamine agonists undergone longer time surgery.
