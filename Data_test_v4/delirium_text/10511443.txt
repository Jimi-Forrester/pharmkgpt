10511443|t|Neural expression profile of alpha-synuclein in developing human cortex.
10511443|a|Alpha-synuclein is a predominantly neuronal presynaptic protein that may play an important role during synaptogenesis and CNS development. In order to elucidate the human developmental expression profile, we used a polyclonal antiserum against the NAC domain of alpha-synuclein. In normal fetal cortex neuroectodermal precursor cells elicited staining in the soma, whereas, in adult cortex, we observed a staining pattern compatible with synaptic function. The same developmental intraneuronal redistribution was found in neurodegenerative disorders, i.e. somatic staining in neuroectodermal precursors in fetal (trisomy 21) and a synaptic pattern in adult (Down's syndrome, Alzheimer's disease) brains. RT-PCR and Western blot analysis revealed expression at all time points studied (4-7.5 months) during human brain development.
