37779561|a|Elderly patients have a high risk of perioperative morbidity and mortality. Pluri-morbidities, polypharmacy, and functional dependence may have a great impact on intraoperative management and request specific cautions. In addition to surgical stress, several perioperative noxious stimuli such as fasting, blood loss, postoperative pain, nausea and vomiting, drug adverse reactions, and immobility may trigger a derangement leading to perioperative complications. Older patients have a high risk of major hemodynamic derangement due to aging of the cardiovascular system and associated comorbidities. The hemodynamic monitoring as well as fluid therapy should be the most accurate as possible. Aging is accompanied by decreased renal function, which is related to a reduction in renal blood flow, renal mass, and the number and size of functioning nephrons. Drugs eliminated predominantly by the renal route need dosage adjustments based on residual renal function. Liver mass, hepatic blood flow, and intrinsic metabolic activity are decreased in the elderly, and all drugs metabolized by the liver have a variable half-life, thus requiring dose reduction. Decreased neural plasticity contributes to a high risk for postoperative delirium. Monitoring of anesthesia depth should be mandatory to avoid overdosage of hypnotic drugs. Prevention of postoperative pulmonary complications requires both protective ventilation strategies and adequate recovery of neuromuscular function at the end of surgery. Avoidance of hypothermia cannot be missed. The aim of this review is to describe comprehensive strategies for intraoperative management plans tailored to meet the unique needs of elderly surgical patients, thus improving outcomes in this vulnerable population.
