37559125|a|BACKGROUND: Tau protein serves a pro-inflammatory function in neuroinflammation. However, the role of tau in other inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is less explored. This study is to investigate the role of endogenous tau and the potential mechanisms in the pathogenesis of inflammatory arthritis. METHODS: We established collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model in wild-type and Tau-/- mice to compare the clinical score and arthritis incidence. Micro-CT analysis was used to evaluate bone erosion of ankle joints. Histological analysis was performed to assess inflammatory cell infiltration, cartilage damage, and osteoclast activity in the ankle joints. Serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines were measured by ELISA. The expression levels of macrophage markers were determined by immunohistochemistry staining and quantitative real-time PCR. RESULTS: Tau expression was upregulated in joints under inflammatory condition. Tau deletion in mice exhibited milder inflammation and protected against the progression of CIA, evidenced by reduced serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and attenuated bone loss, inflammatory cell infiltration, cartilage damage, and osteoclast activity in the ankle joints. Furthermore, tau deficiency led to the inhibition of classically activated type 1 (M1) macrophage polarization in the synovium. CONCLUSION: Tau is a previously unrecognized critical regulator in the pathogenesis of RA and may provide a potential therapeutic target for autoimmune and inflammatory joint diseases.
