34789127|t|Unfolded p53 as a Marker of Oxidative Stress in Mild Cognitive Impairment, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Disease.
34789127|a|AIMS: There are several candidate biomarkers for AD and PD which differ in sensitivity, specificity, cost-effectiveness, invasiveness, logistical and technical demands. This study is aimed to test whether plasma concentration of unfolded p53 may help to discriminate among the neurodegenerative processes occurring in Mild Cognitive Impairment, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. METHODS: An electrochemical immunosensor was used to measure unfolded p53 in plasma samples of 20 Mild Cognitive Impairment (13 males/7 females; mean age 74.95+-5.31), 20 Alzheimer's (11 males/9 females; mean age: 77.25+-7.79), 15 Parkinson's disease patients (12 males/3 females; mean age: 68.60 +- 7.36) and its respective age/sex/studies-matched controls. RESULTS: We observed a significantly higher concentration of unfolded p53 in the plasma of patients of each of the three pathologies with respect to their control groups (p=0.000). Furthermore, the plasma concentration of unfolded p53 was significantly higher in Alzheimer's disease patients in comparison with Mild Cognitive Impairment patients (p=0.000) and Parkinson's disease patients (p=0.006). No significant difference between Mild Cognitive Impairment and Parkinson's disease patients was observed (p=0.524). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that unfolded p53 concentration in the plasma may be a useful biomarker for an undergoing neuropathological process that may be common, albeit with different intensity, to different diseases.
