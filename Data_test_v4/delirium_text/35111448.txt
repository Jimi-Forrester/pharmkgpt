35111448|t|A Case of Complicated Traumatic Generalized Surgical Emphysema, Pneumomediastinum, Pneumopericardium, Pneumothorax, and Pneumoperitoneum Due to Accidental Dislodgement of Tracheostomy Tube.
35111448|a|A tracheostomy tube (TT) is usually taken out in a well-planned and coordinated manner after the underlying condition that necessitated the procedure is resolved. The inadvertent removal or dislodgement of the TT from the stroma is known as accidental extubation or decannulation. This event may prove fatal in a stable patient. Like other respiratory procedures, tracheostomy with the long-term placement of tracheal tube comes with several risks, including scarring of the trachea, pneumothorax, tracheal rupture, and tracheoesophageal fistula. Other complications may include pneumomediastinum (PM) or the escape of air into the surrounding tissue. This may be attributed to several reasons, including mispositioning of the tracheal tube, barotrauma, or tracheal rupture. In some cases, PM presents with free air into cavities such as the thorax, peritoneum, or subcutaneous tissue. Although not fatal, it may require complex treatments such as ventilator management, high-flow oxygen, or, in some cases, surgical intervention. In this article, we describe a rare case of PM and generalized surgical emphysema due to mispositioning of the tracheal tube.
