25552605|t|hecd-1 modulates notch activity in Caenorhabditis elegans.
25552605|a|Notch is a receptor that mediates cell-cell interactions that specify binary cell fate decisions in development and tissue homeostasis. Inappropriate Notch signaling is associated with cancer, and mutations in Notch pathway components have been associated with developmental diseases and syndromes. In Caenorhabditis elegans, suppressors of phenotypes associated with constitutively active LIN-12/Notch have identified many conserved core components and direct or indirect modulators. Here, we molecularly identify sel(ar584), originally isolated as a suppressor of a constitutively active allele of lin-12. We show that sel(ar584) is an allele of hecd-1, the ortholog of human HECDT1, a ubiquitin ligase that has been implicated in several different mammalian developmental events. We studied interactions of hecd-1 with lin-12 in the somatic gonad and with the other C. elegans Notch gene, glp-1, in the germ line. We found that hecd-1 acts as a positive modulator of lin-12/Notch activity in a somatic gonad context--the original basis for its isolation--but acts autonomously as a negative modulator of glp-1/Notch activity in the germ line. As the yeast ortholog of HECD-1, Ufd4p, has been shown to function in quality control, and C. elegans HECD-1 has been shown to affect mitochondrial maintenance, we propose that the different genetic interactions between hecd-1 and Notch genes we observed in different cell contexts may reflect differences in quality control regulatory mechanisms or in cellular metabolism.
