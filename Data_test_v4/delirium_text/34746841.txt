34746841|a|Early diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases, especially Alzheimer's disease (AD), is essential for implementing the appropriate treatment protocols and controlling disease progression. Early AD diagnosis helps patients achieve the best therapeutic outcomes, lessening irreversible neurodegenerative damage and severe cognitive decline. The measurement of brain waves and structural modifications, including gray/white matter and brain volume, have recently been considered a promising approach for brain biometrics because of the inherent specificity, degree of confidentiality, and reproducibility. Brain printing biometrics (BPB) is thus becoming more commonly considered as tool for early AD detection. This review proposes using BPB as a tool for the detection of AD prior to the appearance of persistent hallmark depositions, including Abeta and tau protein aggregations in different brain regions. It also describes BPB authentication, a method of implementation, as well as potential outcomes.
