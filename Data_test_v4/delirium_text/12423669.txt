12423669|a|TV-3326 is a novel cholinesterase inhibitor that produces irreversible brain-selective inhibition of monoamine oxidase (MAO)-A and B and has antidepressant-like activity in rats after chronic oral administration. This study determined whether TV-3326 would cause less potentiation than other irreversible MAO-inhibitors of the blood pressure (BP) response to oral tyramine in conscious rabbits. Dose-response curves were established for the increase in BP induced by tyramine (5-200 mg/kg) administered orally via a naso-pharyngeal tube. From these, the dose that increased BP by 30 mmHg (ED(30)) was computed for each rabbit before and after oral administration of clorgyline, 1 mg/kg for one week, tranylcypromine 10 mg/kg, once, moclobemide, 20 mg/kg 3 times and TV-3326, 26 mg/kg for 2 weeks. Clorgyline, tranylcypromine and TV-3326 inhibited brain MAO-A by 90%; the former two inhibited intestinal MAO-A by 85-97% but TV-3326 had no effect. Tranylcypromine and clorgyline produced 6 and 20-fold increases in the pressor response to tyramine while TV-3326, like moclobemide, only potentiated it 2-fold. If TV-3326 is found to produce as little potentiation of the tyramine response in human subjects, it may be a potentially useful therapeutic agent for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease with depression.
