37481164|a|Late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) is the most frequent cause of dementia in older persons. Subjects affected by type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are at higher risk of vascular disease, cognitive decline, and dementia. LOAD has many characteristics shared with impaired insulin signaling pathways, and substantial evidence has demonstrated a pivotal role in dysregulated glucose metabolism in its pathogenesis. Recent studies have shown that some anti-diabetic drugs, other than regulating the metabolism of peripheral tissues, can also modulate the brain's metabolism, reduce inflammation, and have a direct neuroprotective effect. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) are a newer class with many pleiotropic effects that may have strong neuroprotective potential. After a summary of the principal "anti-diabetic" drugs acting as suitable candidates in treating LOAD, this narrative review explored the potential role of SGLT2i on cognition from pre-clinical to clinical studies.
