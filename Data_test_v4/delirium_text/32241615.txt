32241615|a|OBJECTIVES: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has emerged as the preferred management strategy for elderly patients with severe symptomatic aortic valve stenosis. These patients are often at high risk of postoperative delirium (POD), which is associated with morbidity and mortality. Since POD may be prevented in a considerable part of these patients, identification of patients at risk is essential. The aim of current study was to identify geriatric assessment tools associated with delirium after TAVI, and long-term mortality. METHODS: Consecutive patients were preoperatively assessed by a geriatrician between 2012 and 2017. Geriatric assessment tools consisted of cognitive, functional, mobility, and nutritional tests. POD was prospectively assessed during hospitalization after TAVI. Mortality tracking was performed by consulting municipal registries. RESULTS: A total of 511 patients were included. Median age was 80 [76-84] years, 44.8% (n = 229) were male, and 14.1% (n = 72) had a history of POD. Delirium was observed in 66 (12.9%) patients. Impaired mobility was the strongest geriatric assessment tool associated with POD (adjusted odds ratio, 2.1 [1.1-4.2], P = .028) and 2-year mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.5 [1.4-4.5], P = .003). Two-year survival was reduced with more than 10% in patients with impaired mobility before TAVI (79.4% vs 91.4%, P = .013). CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that impaired mobility is currently the best single predictor for POD and 2-year mortality in high-risk patients undergoing TAVI. Prospective multicenter studies are needed to optimize and to further explore the facilitation of routine use of POD predictors in TAVI pathways of care, and subsequent preventive interventions.
