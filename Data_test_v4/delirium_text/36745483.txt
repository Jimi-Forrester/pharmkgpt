36745483|t|Effectiveness of an Individualized Exergame-Based Motor-Cognitive Training Concept Targeted to Improve Cognitive Functioning in Older Adults With Mild Neurocognitive Disorder: Study Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial.
36745483|a|BACKGROUND: Simultaneous motor-cognitive training is considered promising for preventing the decline in cognitive functioning in older adults with mild neurocognitive disorder (mNCD) and can be highly motivating when applied in the form of exergaming. The literature points to opportunities for improvement in the application of exergames in individuals with mNCD by developing novel exergames and exergame-based training concepts that are specifically tailored to patients with mNCD and ensuring the implementation of effective training components. OBJECTIVE: This study systematically explores the effectiveness of a newly developed exergame-based motor-cognitive training concept (called "Brain-IT") targeted to improve cognitive functioning in older adults with mNCD. METHODS: A 2-arm, parallel-group, single-blinded randomized controlled trial with a 1:1 allocation ratio (ie, intervention: control), including 34 to 40 older adults with mNCD will be conducted between May 2022 and December 2023. The control group will proceed with the usual care provided by the (memory) clinics where the patients are recruited. The intervention group will perform a 12-week training intervention according to the "Brain-IT" training concept, in addition to usual care. Global cognitive functioning will be assessed as the primary outcome. As secondary outcomes, domain-specific cognitive functioning, brain structure and function, spatiotemporal parameters of gait, instrumental activities of daily living, psychosocial factors, and resting cardiac vagal modulation will be assessed. Pre- and postintervention measurements will take place within 2 weeks before starting and after completing the intervention. A 2-way analysis of covariance or the Quade nonparametric analysis of covariance will be computed for all primary and secondary outcomes, with the premeasurement value as a covariate for the predicting group factor and the postmeasurement value as the outcome variable. To determine whether the effects are substantive, partial eta-squared (eta2p) effect sizes will be calculated for all primary and secondary outcomes. RESULTS: Upon the initial submission of this study protocol, 13 patients were contacted by the study team. Four patients were included in the study, 2 were excluded because they were not eligible, and 7 were being informed about the study in detail. Of the 4 included patients, 2 already completed all premeasurements and were in week 2 of the intervention period. Data collection is expected to be completed by December 2023. A manuscript of the results will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed open-access journal in 2024. CONCLUSIONS: This study contributes to the evidence base in the highly relevant area of preventing disability because of cognitive impairment, which has been declared a public health priority by the World Health Organization.
