34285451|t|THE ENIGMA OF LEWY BODY DEMENTIA: A CASE REPORT.
34285451|a|Lewy body dementia is a progressive neurodegenerative disease and is considered to be the second most common cause of dementia in the elderly. Because of the complexity of clinical presentation, it is often misdiagnosed and mistaken for other dementias, which may result in administering inappropriate therapy, and thus worsening of the patient condition. We reviewed a case of a 71-year-old patient whose clinical presentation gradually occurred with complex visual hallucinations, atypical extrapyramidal motor symptoms, fluctuating cognitive impairments with delirious episodes, and oscillating syncope. Depressive mood, impaired daily functioning and sensitivity to antipsychotics were also noted. Extensive diagnostic workup was performed with neuropsychological testing and use of single-photon emission computerized tomography. Considering the clinical presentation and diagnostic procedures performed, the diagnosis of Lewy body dementia was set and pharmacotherapy was revised. We discuss the importance of taking overall clinical presentation and diagnostic treatment in consideration and applying appropriate therapy to slow down the progression of the disease and exacerbation of the patient's psychological functions.
