35526279|t|A case for continuing statin medications in the intensive care unit: Reducing the risk for delirium.
35526279|a|PURPOSE: The objective of this review is to detail the utility of statin medications in the prevention and treatment of intensive care unit (ICU) delirium. SUMMARY: Delirium is a syndrome characterized by altered mental status, inattention, and disorganized thinking. It is particularly concerning in the ICU where specific risk factors are much more prevalent. Nonpharmacological therapy is the mainstay of treatment, aimed at increasing patient awareness; pharmacological therapies have also been explored with varying success. The utility of statin medications in this scenario has been investigated because of the numerous pleiotropic effects of these drugs. Although the benefits in terms of treating delirium are uncertain, statins may be good candidates for prevention. The peak anti-inflammatory effect of statins is delayed, so initiating a statin on admission will likely have little protective benefit, whereas continuation of a home regimen seems more likely to exert an effect. CONCLUSION: Statin medications are very commonly used, and, while their role in treating delirium is unclear, continuation of these medications from a home regimen is reasonable to decrease the odds of delirium in the intensive care population.
