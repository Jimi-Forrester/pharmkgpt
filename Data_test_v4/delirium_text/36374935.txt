36374935|t|Circulating Bile Acids as Biomarkers for Disease Diagnosis and Prevention.
36374935|a|CONTEXT: Bile acids (BAs) are pivotal signaling molecules that regulate energy metabolism and inflammation. Recent epidemiological studies have reported specific alterations in circulating BA profiles in certain disease states, including obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and Alzheimer disease (AD). In the past decade, breakthroughs have been made regarding the translation of BA profiling into clinical use for disease prediction. In this review, we summarize and synthesize recent data on variation in circulating BA profiles in patients with various diseases to evaluate the value of these biomarkers in human plasma for early diagnosis. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: This review is based on a collection of primary and review literature gathered from a PubMed search for BAs, obesity, T2DM, insulin resistance (IR), NAFLD, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), colon cancer, and AD, among other keywords. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Individuals with obesity, T2DM, HCC, CCA, or AD showed specific alterations in circulating BA profiles. These alterations may have existed long before the initial diagnosis of these diseases. The intricate relationship between obesity, IR, and NAFLD complicates the establishment of clear and independent associations between BA profiles and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Alterations in the levels of total BAs and several BA species were seen across the entire spectrum of NAFLD, demonstrating significant increases with the worsening of histological features. CONCLUSIONS: Aberrant circulating BA profiles are an early event in the onset and progression of obesity, T2DM, HCC, and AD. The pleiotropic effects of BAs explain these broad connections. Circulating BA profiles could provide a basis for the development of biomarkers for the diagnosis and prevention of a wide range of diseases.
