38488549|a|It has been reported both in clinic and rodent models that beyond spinal cord injury directly induced symptoms, such as paralysis, neuropathic pain, bladder/bowel dysfunction, and loss of sexual function, there are a variety of secondary complications, including memory loss, cognitive decline, depression, and Alzheimer's disease. The large-scale longitudinal population-based studies indicate that post-trauma depression is highly prevalent in spinal cord injury patients. Yet, few basic studies have been conducted to address the potential molecular mechanisms. One of possible factors underlying the depression is the reduction of adult hippocampal neurogenesis which may come from less physical activity, social isolation, chronic pain, and elevated neuroinflammation after spinal cord injury. However, there is no clear consensus yet. In this review, we will first summarize the alteration of hippocampal neurogenesis post-spinal cord injury. Then, we will discuss possible mechanisms underlie this important spinal cord injury consequence. Finally, we will outline the potential therapeutic options aimed at enhancing hippocampal neurogenesis to ameliorate depression.
