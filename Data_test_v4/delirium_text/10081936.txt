10081936|a|The size frequency distributions of diffuse, primitive and classic beta-amyloid (Abeta) deposits were studied in single sections of cortical tissue from patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Down's syndrome (DS) and compared with those predicted by the log-normal model. In a sample of brain regions, these size distributions were compared with those obtained by serial reconstruction through the tissue and the data used to adjust the size distributions obtained in single sections. The adjusted size distributions of the diffuse, primitive and classic deposits deviated significantly from a log-normal model in AD and DS, the greatest deviations from the model being observed in AD. More Abeta deposits were observed close to the mean and fewer in the larger size classes than predicted by the model. Hence, the growth of Abeta deposits in AD and DS does not strictly follow the log-normal model, deposits growing to within a more restricted size range than predicted. However, Abeta deposits grow to a larger size in DS compared with AD which may reflect differences in the mechanism of Abeta formation.
