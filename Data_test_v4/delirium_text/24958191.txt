24958191|a|Recent genome-wide association studies identified clusterin (CLU) to be associated with sporadic Alzheimer's disease. To help clarify the relevance of CLU as genetic determinant of AD, we analyzed its association in southern Chinese Han population. This study comprised 499 sporadic Alzheimer's disease patients and 592 unrelated age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Four single-nucleotide polymorphisms (rs2279590, rs9331888, rs11136000, and rs1532278) within CLU were selected for genotyping. No positive association was found between the CLU variants and AD. Our study suggests that CLU variants may not be an AD susceptibility factor in southern Chinese Han population.
