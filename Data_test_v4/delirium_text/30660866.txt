30660866|t|Generation of a set of isogenic, gene-edited iPSC lines homozygous for all main APOE variants and an APOE knock-out line.
30660866|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most frequent neurodegenerative disease amongst the elderly. The SNPs rs429358 and rs7412 in the APOE gene are the most common risk factor for sporadic AD, and there are three different alleles commonly referred to as APOE-epsilon2, APOE-epsilon3 and APOE-epsilon4. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) hold great promise to model AD as such cells can be differentiated in vitro to the required cell type. Here we report the use of CRISPR/Cas9 technology employed on iPSCs from a healthy individual with an APOE-epsilon3/epsilon4 genotype to obtain isogenic APOE-epsilon2/epsilon2, APOE-epsilon3/epsilon3, APOE-epsilon4/epsilon4 lines as well as an APOE-knock-out line.
