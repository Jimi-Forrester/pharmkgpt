29866998|t|Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation for Older Adults with Acute Myeloid Leukemia.
29866998|a|Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a disease that affects adults aged 65 years and above, and survival in this population is poor. Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) is a potentially curative therapy for these patients but is underutilized due to frequent comorbidities and perceived higher risk of treatment-related mortality and non-relapse mortality. Increasing data supports the utility of allo-HCT in fit older patients after intensive chemotherapy resulting in improvement of outcomes. With the development of reduced intensity and non-myeloablative conditioning regimens that are associated with lower rates of treatment-related toxicity and mortality, this has allowed more older patients with AML to receive allo-HCT. In this review, we provide some guidance on appropriate selection of older patients as transplant candidates, benefits and risks associated with allo-HCT, conditioning regimen choice, and stem cell transplant sources as they relate to the conduct of stem cell transplantation in older patients.
