39010171|t|Study on the preventive effect of dexmedetomidine on anesthetic associated sleep disturbance in young to middle-aged female patients undergoing hysteroscopy: a study protocol for a crossover randomized controlled trial.
39010171|a|BACKGROUND: Postoperative sleep disturbance has a potentially detrimental effect on postoperative recovery. Perioperative patients are affected by several factors. General anesthesia induces a non-physiological state that does not resemble natural sleep. Exposure to propofol/sevoflurane can lead to desynchronization of the circadian rhythm, which may result in postoperative sleep disturbance characterized by mid-cycle advancement of sleep and daytime sleepiness. Dexmedetomidine is a highly selective alpha2-adrenoceptor agonist with a unique sedative effect that facilitates the transition from sleep to wakefulness. Basic research has shown that dexmedetomidine induces deep sedation, similar to physical sleep, and helps maintain forebrain connectivity, which is likely to reduce delirium after surgery. The aim of this study is to evaluate the influence of exposure to the mono-anesthetic propofol on the development of postoperative sleep disturbance in young and middle-aged female patients undergoing hysteroscopy and whether prophylactic administration of dexmedetomidine influences reducing postoperative sleep disturbance. METHODS: This prospective randomized controlled trial (RCT) will include 150 patients undergoing hysteroscopy at the First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University. Participants will be randomly assigned to three groups in a 1:1:1 ratio. The dexmedetomidine group will have two subgroups and will receive a nasal spray of 0.2 microg/kg or 0.5 microg/kg 25 min before surgery, while the control group will receive a saline nasal spray. Three groups will undergo hysteroscopy with propofol-based TIVA according to the same scheme. Sleep quality will be measured using a wearable device and double-blind sleep assessments will be performed before surgery and 1, 3, and 7 days after surgery. SPSS 2.0 is used for statistical analysis. A chi2 test is used to compare groups, and t-test is used to determine statistical the significance of continuous variables. DISCUSSION: The purpose of this study is to investigate the incidence of propofol-associated sleep disorders and to test a combination of dexmedetomidine anesthesia regimen for the prevention of postoperative sleep disorders. This study will help to improve patients' postoperative satisfaction and provide a new strategy for comfortable perioperative medical treatment. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT06281561.
