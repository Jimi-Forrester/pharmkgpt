37568864|t|Diagnosis of Migrainous Infarction: A Case Report and Analysis of Previously Published Cases.
37568864|a|Migrainous infarction (MI) is a rare disorder. The precise diagnostic criteria for this diagnosis have been available in the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD) since 1988, but many cases do not fulfil these criteria. This paper describes a good example of MI and analyzes previously published case reports. We report a very special case of MI in an 18-year-old woman who had a recurrent episode of migraine with a similar aura with numbness of the right arm and speech disturbances which had an unusually long duration (>120 min). On admission to the headache centre "Europe-Asia", she complained of slowness of speech and problems with choice of words. An MRI showed acute lacunar infarcts in the left parietal subcortical area. Ischemic infarcts were localized in a relevant area on the left side and the aura symptoms were right-sided. The patient, therefore, fulfilled the ICHD-3 diagnostic criteria for "Migrainous infarction". An analysis of 35 previously published articles with case reports about MI showed that 22 did not meet the diagnostic criteria of the ICHD for migrainous infarction. Using all this, we developed diagnostic recommendations for migrainous infarction which can help to improve the quality of diagnosis when used together with the diagnostic criteria of the ICHD for migrainous infarction.
