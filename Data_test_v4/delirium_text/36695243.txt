36695243|a|Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of adding dexmedetomidine to ropivacaine on pain relief and quality of recovery in older patients undergoing open inguinal hernia repair surgeries. Methods: This was a prospective and randomised clinical trial of 102 patients aged over 65 years who received an ultrasound-guided transversus open mesh herniorrhaphy abdominis plane (TAP) block with either 0.375% ropivacaine 20 ml (Group R, n = 47) or 0.375% ropivacaine combined with 1 mug/kg dexmedetomidine 20 ml (Group RD, n = 45) in the pre-anaesthesia care unit before elective open inguinal hernia surgeries. The primary outcome measure was Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) pain scores at rest and on movement at 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24 h and at 1 and 3 months' postoperatively. The secondary outcome measures were the incidence of post-operative delirium (POD), nausea and vomiting and the occurrence of side effects or complications on post-operative day 1. Results: Group RD had lower VAS scores at rest and on movement at 8 and 12 h postoperatively and a lower incidence of POD on the post-operative day 1 than Group R. Transient bradycardia was more frequent in Group RD than in Group R, and side effects or post-operative complications were reported in either group. Conclusion: The addition of dexmedetomidine to ropivacaine in a TAP block enhances postoperative analgesia during hospitalisation and improves the quality of recovery without affecting chronic pain in older patients undergoing open inguinal hernia repair surgery.
