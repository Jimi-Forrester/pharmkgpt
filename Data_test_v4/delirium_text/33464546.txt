33464546|a|Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was first identified in late December 2019. The disease began in Wuhan, Hubei province in China and since then it has spread quickly to many countries all over the world. COVID-19 is caused by a novel coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus was majorly seen to overwhelm the respiratory system with mild to severe acute respiratory syndrome considered pathognomic for the disease. However, with time a plethora of symptoms was observed in the patients infected with COVID-19 including strong evidence for neurological symptoms. Evidence suggests that the virus has both central and peripheral nervous system manifestations. Patients, particularly those who suffer from a severe illness, have a central nervous system (CNS) involvement and neurological manifestations. There is precise and targeted documentation of neurological symptoms with details of clinical, neurological, and electrophysiological findings. This review article thus gives an insight into the neuro-invasive potential of COVID-19 and discusses the possible pathogenesis.
