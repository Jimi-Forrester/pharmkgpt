22343025|t|3,3',4',5,5'-Pentahydroxyflavone is a potent inhibitor of amyloid beta fibril formation.
22343025|a|The natural flavonoid fisetin (3,3',4',7-tetrahydroxyflavone) is neurotrophic and prevents fibril formation of amyloid beta protein (Abeta). It is a promising lead compound for the development of therapeutic drugs for Alzheimer's disease. To find even more effective drugs based on the structure of fisetin, we synthesized a series of fisetin analogues lacking the 7-hydroxyl group and compared their effects on Abeta fibril formation determined by the thioflavin T fluorescence assay. 3,3',4'-Trihydroxyflavone and 3',4'-dihydroxyflavone inhibited Abeta fibril formation more potently than fisetin or 3',4',7-trihydroxyflavone, suggesting that the 7-hydroxy group is not necessary for anti-amyloidogenic activity. 3,3',4',5'-Tetrahydroxyflavone and 3',4',5'-trihydroxyflavone inhibited Abeta fibril formation far more potently than 3,3',4'-trihydroxyflavone and 3',4'-dihydroxyflavone, suggesting that 3',4',5'-trihydroxyl group of the B ring is crucial for the anti-amyloidogenic activity of flavonoids. Based on the structure-activity relationship, we synthesized 3,3',4',5,5'-pentahydroxyflavone, and confirmed that this compound is the most potent inhibitor of Abeta fibril formation among fisetin analogues that have been tested. Cytotoxicity assay using rat hippocampal neuron cultures demonstrated that Abeta preincubated with 3,3',4',5,5'-pentahydroxyflavone was significantly less toxic than Abeta preincubated with vehicle. 3,3',4',5,5'-Pentahydroxyflavone could be a new therapeutic drug candidate for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
