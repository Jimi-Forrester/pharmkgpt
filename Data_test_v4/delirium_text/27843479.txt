27843479|a|The extract of Psoralea corylifolia seeds (PCE) has been widely used as a herbal medicine because of its beneficial effect on human health. In this study, we investigated the protective effects and molecular mechanisms of PCE on palmitate- (PA-) induced toxicity in PC12 cells, a neuron-like cell line. PCE significantly increased cell viability in PA-treated PC12 cells and showed antiapoptotic effects, as evidenced by decreased expression of cleaved caspase-3, cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, and bax protein as well as increased expression of bcl-2 protein. In addition, PCE treatment reduced PA-induced reactive oxygen species production and upregulated mRNA levels of antioxidant genes such as nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 and heme oxygenase 1. Moreover, PCE treatment recovered the expression of autophagy marker genes such as beclin-1 and p62, which was decreased by PA treatment. Treatment with isopsoralen, one of the major components of PCE extract, also recovered the expression of autophagy marker genes and reduced PA-induced apoptosis. In conclusion, PCE exerts protective effects against lipotoxicity via its antioxidant function, and this effect is mediated by activation of autophagy. PCE might be a potential pharmacological agent to protect against neuronal cell injury caused by oxidative stress or lipotoxicity.
