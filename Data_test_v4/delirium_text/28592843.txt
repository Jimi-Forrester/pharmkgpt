28592843|a|A novel polymeric mixed micelle composed of Pluronic F127 and D-alpha-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol succinate (TPGS) was developed to improve the delivery of fluorescent dyes and protein across the blood brain barrier (BBB). Rhodamine 123 (Rho123) and DiR loaded mixed micelles, composed of Pluronic F127 and TPGS with proportion of 4:1 (FT), were prepared by thin-film hydration, and beta-galactosidase (beta-Gal) loaded FT mixed micelles were prepared by self-assembly. The brain-targeted capability of FT mixed micelles were evaluated both in vitro and in vivo. The FT mixed micelles showed that a average particle size of 20.03 nm, and a low CMC of 0.0031% in water. The in vitro release of Rho123 from Rho123 loaded FT mixed micelles (FT/Rho123) presented a sustained-release property. FT/Rho123 also showed higher efficiency for the accumulation in brain capillary endothelial cells (BCECs) and brain tissues. beta-Gal, a model protein, was also delivered and accumulated efficiently in the brain by spontaneous loading in the FT mixed micelles. Therefore, the results indicated that F127/TPGS mixed micelles may be considered as an effective nanocarrier for the brain-targeted delivery of diagnostic and therapeutic drugs.
