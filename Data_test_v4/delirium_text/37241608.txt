37241608|t|Neurotoxicity of Silver Nanoparticles and Non-Linear Development of Adaptive Homeostasis with Age.
37241608|a|For the first time in the world, the behavioral functions of laboratory mammals exposed to silver nanoparticles were studied with regard to age. Silver nanoparticles coated with polyvinylpyrrolidone with a size of 8.7 nm were used in the present research as a potential xenobiotic. Elder mice adapted to the xenobiotic better than the younger animals. Younger animals demonstrated more drastic anxiety than the elder ones. A hormetic effect of the xenobiotic in elder animals was observed. Thus, it is concluded that adaptive homeostasis non-linearly changes with age increase. Presumably, it may improve during the prime of life and start to decline just after a certain stage. This work demonstrates that age growth is not directly conjugated with the organism fading and pathology development. Oppositely, vitality and resistance to xenobiotics may even improve with age at least until the prime of life.
