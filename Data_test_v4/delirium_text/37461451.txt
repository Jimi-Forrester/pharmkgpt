37461451|t|Defining Dementia Subtypes Through Neuropsychiatric Symptom-Linked Brain Connectivity Patterns.
37461451|a|BACKGROUND: Dementia is highly heterogeneous, with pronounced individual differences in neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) and neuroimaging findings. Understanding the heterogeneity of NPS and associated brain abnormalities is essential for effective management and treatment of dementia. METHODS: Using large-scale neuroimaging data from the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS-3), we conducted a multivariate sparse canonical correlation analysis to identify functional connectivity-informed symptom dimensions. Subsequently, we performed a clustering analysis on the obtained latent connectivity profiles to reveal neurophysiological subtypes and examined differences in abnormal connectivity and phenotypic profiles between subtypes. RESULTS: We identified two reliable neuropsychiatric subsyndromes - behavioral and anxiety in the connectivity-NPS linked latent space. The behavioral subsyndrome was characterized by the connections predominantly involving the default mode and somatomotor networks and neuropsychiatric symptoms involving nighttime behavior disturbance, agitation, and apathy. The anxiety subsyndrome was mainly contributed by connections involving the visual network and the anxiety neuropsychiatric symptom. By clustering individuals along these two subsyndromes-linked connectivity latent features, we uncovered three subtypes encompassing both dementia patients and healthy controls. Dementia in one subtype exhibited similar brain connectivity and cognitive-behavior patterns to healthy individuals. However, dementia in the other two subtypes showed different dysfunctional connectivity profiles involving the default mode, frontoparietal control, somatomotor, and ventral attention networks, compared to healthy individuals. These dysfunctional connectivity patterns were associated with differences in baseline dementia severity and longitudinal progression of cognitive impairment and behavioral dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings shed valuable insights into disentangling the neuropsychiatric and brain functional heterogeneity of dementia, offering a promising avenue to improve clinical management and facilitate the development of timely and targeted interventions for dementia patients.
