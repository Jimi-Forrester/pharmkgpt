33171483|t|A compound downregulation of SRRM2 and miR-27a-3p with upregulation of miR-27b-3p in PBMCs of Parkinson's patients is associated with the early stage onset of disease.
33171483|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is diagnosed when motor symptoms emerges, which almost 70% of dopamine neurons are lost. Therefore, early diagnosis of PD is crucial to prevent the progress of disease. Blood-based biomarkers, which are minimally invasive, potentially used for diagnosis of PD, including miRNAs. The aim of this study was to assess whether SRRM2 and miR-27a/b-3p could act as early diagnostic biomarkers for PD. Total RNAs from PBMCs of 30 PD's patients and 14 healthy age and gender matched subjects was extracted. The expression levels of respective genes were assessed. Data were presented applying a two-tailed unpaired t-test and one-way ANOVA. We observed significant down-regulation of SRRM2 (p = 0.0002) and miR-27a-3p (p = 0.0001), and up-regulation of miR-27b-3p (p = 0.02) in PBMCs of Parkinson's patients. Down-regulation of miR-27a-3p is associated with increasing disease severity, whereas the up-regulation of miR-27b-3p was observed mostly at HY-1 and disease duration between 3-5 years. There was a negative correlation between SRRM2 and miR-27b-3p expressions, and miR-27a-3p positively was correlated with miR-27b-3p. Based on functional enrichment analysis, SRRM2 and miR-27a/b-3p acted on common functional pathways. miR-27a/b-3p could potentially predict the progression and severity of PD. Although both miRs had no similarity on expression, a positive correlation between both miRs was identified, supporting their potential role as biomarkers in clinical PD stages. Of note that SRRM2 and miR-27a-3p were able to distinguish PD patients from healthy individuals. Functional analysis of the similarity between genes associated with SRRM2 and miR-27a/b-3p indicates common functional pathways and their dysfunction correlates with molecular etiopathology mechanisms of PD onset.
