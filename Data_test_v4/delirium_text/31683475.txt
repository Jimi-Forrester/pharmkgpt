31683475|t|Psychiatric Phenocopy Syndrome of Behavioral Frontotemporal Dementia: Behavioral and Cognitive Fingerprint.
31683475|a|Behavioral and cognitive variables predicting behavioral frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) versus primary psychiatric disorders mimicking bvFTD (phenocopy syndrome: bvFTD-PS) were studied. Forty-one probable/definite bvFTD and 16 bvFTD-PS patients were evaluated with cognitive battery, Neuropsychiatric Inventory, and Stereotypic and Ritualistic Behavior-revised questionnaires. Twenty-seven healthy subjects served as control. Severity of cognitive impairment/behavioral symptoms and profile of cognitive deficits were similar, with bvFTD-PS showing impaired executive abilities and memory. However, phonemic fluency was impaired only in bvFTD (p < 0.001). Depression was worse in bvFTD-PS, while apathy, disinhibition, and dietary changes characterized bvFTD. Phonemic fluency and depression accounted for the best predictive diagnostic model. A structured psychiatric screening of bvFTD mimickers may often yield a psychiatric diagnosis with predominant depressive symptoms and therefore a potentially treatable condition.
