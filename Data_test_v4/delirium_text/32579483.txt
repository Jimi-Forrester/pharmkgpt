32579483|t|Protective effect of dexmedetomidine infusion combined with epidural blockade on postoperative complications after surgery: A prospective randomized controlled clinical trial.
32579483|a|OBJECTIVES: This prospective, randomized, controlled study aimed to explore the efficacy of dexmedetomidine combined with epidural blockade on postoperative recovery of elderly patients after radical resection for colorectal cancer. METHODS: Ninety-six elderly patients who underwent radical resection for colorectal cancer were randomly divided into the following four groups: dexmedetomidine, epidural blockade (ropivacaine), combined (dexmedetomidine + epidural blockade), and control (0.9% saline). The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Visual Analog Scale (VAS), and Ramsay scores at 48 hours, and time to first activity, length of hospital stay, and postoperative complication rates at 3 months were assessed. RESULTS: Twelve hours after surgery, Ramsay scores were higher in the combined compared with the control and epidural blockade groups. Twenty-four hours after surgery, MMSE scores were higher in the combined compared with the other groups. The combined group showed the lowest VAS scores except at 48 hours. Time to first activity and length of hospital stay were significantly shorter in the combined compared with the other groups. There was no difference in total postoperative complication rates among the groups. CONCLUSIONS: A combination of intraoperative dexmedetomidine infusion and epidural blockade could mitigate pain after surgery, improve cognitive dysfunction in early surgery, and facilitate recovery.
