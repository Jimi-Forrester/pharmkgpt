21322614|t|Cell-permeable and plasma-stable peptidomimetic inhibitors of the postsynaptic density-95/N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor interaction.
21322614|a|The protein--protein interaction between the NMDA receptor and its intracellular scaffolding protein, PSD-95, is a potential target for treating ischemic brain diseases, neuropathic pain, and Alzheimer's disease. We have previously demonstrated that N-alkylated tetrapeptides are potent inhibitors of this interaction, and here, this template is exploited for the development of blood plasma-stable and cell-permeable inhibitors. Initially, we explored both the amino acid sequence of the tetrapeptide and the nature of the N-alkyl groups, which consolidated N-cyclohexylethyl-ETAV (1) as the most potent and selective compound. Next, the amide moieties of N-methylated ETAV were systematically replaced with thioamides, demonstrating that one of three amide bonds could be replaced without compromising the affinity. Subsequent optimization of the N-alkyl groups and evaluation of cell permeability led to identification of N-cyclohexylethyl-ETA(S)V (54) as the most potent, plasma-stable and cell-permeable inhibitor, which is a promising tool in unraveling the therapeutic potential of the PSD-95/NMDA receptor interaction.
