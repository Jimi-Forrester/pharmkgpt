39061982|t|Efficacy of Photobiomodulation Therapy in Older Adults: A Systematic Review.
39061982|a|BACKGROUND: The aim was to determine whether there is any available evidence on the efficacy of photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) in older adults. METHODS: A literature search was performed including all articles published up to February 2024. Studies reporting data on PBMT in older adults were included. This study was registered with PROSPERO. RESULTS: In total, 406 studies were identified. After eliminating duplicates and irrelevant studies, 10 records were included in the final review. In all included studies, the protocols used to deliver PBMT were different in terms of type of device, wavelength, irradiation duration, and pulse frequency. In neurodegenerative diseases, two studies reported non-significant results, while two studies reported efficacy of PBMT. In wounds and ulcers, two out of three studies reported efficacy of PBMT. In macular degeneration, one study reported efficacy of PBMT. One study on hyposalivation reported efficacy of PBMT. CONCLUSION: PBMT appears to be a promising complementary treatment. All studies reported good compliance and safety throughout the treatment. In the future, it will be essential to harmonize PBMT parameters. Further studies are warranted to define the best indications, the most effective protocols, and the right population to target for use in routine practice.
