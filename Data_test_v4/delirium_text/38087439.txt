38087439|a|Aging is an inevitable natural process that impacts every individual, and understanding its effect on the gut microbiome and dendritic cell (DC) functionality in elderly subjects is crucial. DCs are vital antigen-presenting cells (APCs) that orchestrate the immune response, maintaining immune tolerance to self-antigens and bridging innate and adaptive immunity. With aging, there is a shift toward nonspecific innate immunity, resulting in a decline in adaptive immune responses. This alteration raises significant concerns about managing the health of an elderly population. However, the precise impact of aging and microbiome changes on DC function and their implications in lung-associated diseases remain relatively understudied. To illuminate this subject, we will discuss recent advancements in understanding the connections between aging, gut dysbiosis, DCs, and lung diseases. Emphasizing the key concepts linking age-related gut microbiome changes and DC functions, we will focus on their relevance to overall health and immune response in elderly individuals. This article aims to improve our understanding of the intricate relationship between aging, gut microbiome, and DCs, potentially benefiting the management of age-associated diseases and promoting healthy aging.
