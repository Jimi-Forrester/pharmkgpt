34456351|a|BACKGROUND: Neurocognitive dysfunction is an important issue in patients with frontal lobe lesions. These patients who may be in good neurological status may succumb to neurocognitive dysfunction, affecting their daily living and hampering the quality of life. This study aims to correlate pre- and post-operative neurocognitive dysfunction in patients with frontal lobe lesions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective analysis of 50 patients of newly-diagnosed frontal lobe tumors of any grade deemed suitable for surgical resection was carried out. All patients underwent neurocognitive testing using frontal assessment battery (FAB), mini mental state examination, and verbal learning and memory test pre- and post-operatively. RESULTS: In this study, 22 patients had right frontal lobe lesion, whereas in 24 patients, it was located in the left frontal lobe, and 4 patients had bilateral lesions. Only 12 patients were found to be in good FAB score preoperatively, and all of them had symptom duration of less than 3 months. 1-week postsurgery, 26 patients achieved a good score, which increased to 44 at 3rd month. Patients who had psychological dysfunction for more than 3 months had average-to-bad preoperative FAB scores, while at 3rd month postoperatively, only six patients were in average score and none in bad score. CONCLUSION: Frontal lobe lesion should be kept in mind in patients with neurocognitive dysfunction. FAB is a simple bedside test that should be included in routine neurological examination in daily neurosurgical practice to assess long-term functional outcome in patients with frontal lobe lesions.
