31487961|a|The regulation of cerebral blood flow (CBF) allows for the metabolic demands of the brain to be met and for normal brain function including cognition (learning and memory). Regulation of CBF ensures relatively constant blood flow to the brain despite changes in systemic blood pressure, protecting the fragile micro-vessels from damage. CBF regulation is altered in pregnancy and is further altered by hypertension and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy including preeclampsia. The mechanisms contributing to changes in CBF in normal pregnancy, hypertension, and preeclampsia have not been fully elucidated. This review summarizes what is known about changes in CBF regulation during pregnancy, hypertension, and preeclampsia.
