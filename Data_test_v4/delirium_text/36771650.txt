36771650|t|Cachrys L. Genus: A Comprehensive Review on Botany, Phytochemistry and Biological Properties.
36771650|a|The Cachrys L. genus belongs to the Apiaceae family and it is widely distributed in the Mediterranean basin, with plant species being endemic to southern Europe, Asia, and northern Africa. Different studies, focused on the phytochemical composition of Cachrys spp. and the biological properties of their phytocomplexes, have been reported. These works mostly focused on the essential oils obtained from these plants, and pointed out that Cachrys species are a rich source of coumarins, mainly furanocoumarins. Other phytochemicals, such as terpenes, fatty acids, phytosterols, and flavonoids have been also identified. Moreover, a number of biological properties such as antioxidant, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, cytotoxic, and photocytotoxic effects have been assessed. Nevertheless, a review of the chemical and pharmacological properties of this genus is not available in the literature. The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of the reports concerning the identified phytochemicals and the biological effects reported for Cachrys spp., and to offer a comprehensive understanding of the potential of this genus as a source of bioactive compounds. The current taxonomy, the traditional uses, and the toxicological aspects of plants belonging to this genus are also reported, and the future research directions are discussed.
