31623198|a|Monosialotetrahexosylganglioside (GM1) has good activity on brain diseases and was developed to be a drug applied in clinics for neurological disorders and nerve injury. It is difficult to isolate GM1 in industry scale from the brains directly. In this work, a simple and highly efficient method with high yield was developed for the isolation, conversion, and purification of GM1 from a pig brain. Gangliosides (GLS) were first extracted by supercritical CO2 (SCE). The optimum extraction time of GLS by SCE was 4 h, and the ratio of entrainer to acetone powder from the pig brain was 3:1 (v/w). GM1 was then prepared from GLS by immobilized sialidase and purified by reverse-phase silica gel. Sodium alginate embedding was used for the immobilization of sialidase. Under the optimized method, the yield of high-purity GM1 was around 0.056%. This method has the potential to be applied in the production of GM1 in the industry.
