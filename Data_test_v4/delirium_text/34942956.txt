34942956|a|The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has affected the daily life of the worldwide population since 2020. Links between the newly discovered viral infection and the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases have been investigated in different studies. This review aims to summarize the literature concerning COVID-19 and Parkinson's disease (PD) to give an overview on the interface between viral infection and neurodegeneration with regard to this current topic. We will highlight SARS-CoV-2 neurotropism, neuropathology and the suspected pathophysiological links between the infection and neurodegeneration as well as the psychosocial impact of the pandemic on patients with PD. Some evidence discussed in this review suggests that the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic might be followed by a higher incidence of neurodegenerative diseases in the future. However, the data generated so far are not sufficient to confirm that COVID-19 can trigger or accelerate neurodegenerative diseases.
