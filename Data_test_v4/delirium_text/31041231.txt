31041231|t|Frequency of dyslipidemia in migraineurs in comparison to control group.
31041231|a|BACKGROUND: Migraine is a common disease with neurovascular nature, which is commonly prevalent in the general population. Due to the significant prevalence of migraine and its long-term complications, it is necessary to pay attention to its exacerbating factors. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency distribution of dyslipidemia in patients with migraine compared with control group. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a case-control study, in which 50 patients with migraine (with aura and without aura) were confirmed by the criteria of International Headache Society. Migraineurs and control group (n = 50) were selected from among patients who referred to the Neurology Clinic of Imam Hossein Hospital. The levels of total cholesterol, triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol were measured in both the groups. SPSS software (version 21) was used to analyze the data. RESULTS: The findings showed that among migraineurs, 21 patients (42%) revealed high levels of cholesterol and 22 revealed high levels of LDL (44%); whereas among subjects without migraine, 12 subjects (24%) exhibited high levels of cholesterol and 12 (24%) high levels of LDL, where a significant correlation between the two groups was achieved. CONCLUSION: The present results showed that migraine is associated with higher level of cholesterol and LDL when compared with the control group, where a significant relationship was found.
