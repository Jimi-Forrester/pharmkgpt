37559916|t|Factors associated with psychiatric and physical comorbidities in bipolar disorder: a nationwide multicenter cross-sectional observational study.
37559916|a|Background: Bipolar disorder (BD) is a chronic and disabling affective disorder with significant morbidity and mortality. Despite the high rate of psychiatric and physical health comorbidity, little is known about the complex interrelationships between clinical features of bipolar illness and comorbid conditions. The present study sought to examine, quantify and characterize the cross-sectional associations of psychiatric and physical comorbidities with selected demographic and clinical characteristics of adults with BD. Methods: A nationwide multicenter cross-sectional observational epidemiological study conducted from October 2015 to March 2017 in Slovakia. Results: Out of 179 study participants [median age 49 years (interquartile range IQR 38-58); 57.5% females], 22.4% were free of comorbidity, 42.5% had both psychiatric and physical comorbidities, 53.6% at least one psychiatric comorbidity, and 66.5% at least one physical comorbidity. The most prevalent were the essential hypertension (33.5%), various psychoactive substance-related disorders (21.2%), specific personality disorders (14.6%), obesity (14.5%), and disorders of lipoprotein metabolism (14%). The presence of an at least one physical comorbidity, atypical symptoms of BD, and unemployed status were each associated with an at least one psychiatric comorbidity independent of sex, early onset of BD (age of onset <35 years), BD duration and pattern of BD illness progression (p < 0.001). The presence of various psychoactive substance-related disorders, BD duration, atypical symptoms of BD, unemployed status, pension, female sex, and not using antipsychotics were each associated with an at least one physical comorbidity independent of the pattern of BD illness progression (p < 0.001). In several other multiple regression models, the use of antipsychotics (in particular, olanzapine) was associated with a decreased probability of the essential hypertension and predicted the clinical phenotype of comorbidity-free BD (p < 0.05). Conclusion: This cross-national study has reported novel estimates and clinical correlates related to both the comorbidity-free phenotype and the factors associated with psychiatric and physical comorbidities in adults with BD in Slovakia. The findings provide new insights into understanding of the clinical presentation of BD that can inform clinical practice and further research to continue to investigate potential mechanisms of BD adverse outcomes and disease complications onset.
