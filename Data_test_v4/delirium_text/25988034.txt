25988034|t|Cognitive dysfunction during anti-NMDA-receptor encephalitis is present in early phase of the disease.
25988034|a|Anti-NMDA-receptor encephalitis is an autoimmune disorder with a well-defined set of clinical features including psychiatric changes (anxiety, agitation, bizarre behaviour, delusional or paranoid thoughts), epileptic seizures and cognitive disturbance followed by movement disorders including orofacial dyskinesias, alterations in the level of consciousness and dysautonomia. Although the cognitive changes are not always very clear at presentation, they can persist after recovery from the acute and often prolonged illness. However, there are few studies describing neuropsychiatric changes in depth, both in the early course of the disease and in long-term follow-up.
