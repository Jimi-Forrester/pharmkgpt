31005497|t|Delirium: Medical Students' Knowledge and Effectiveness of Different Teaching Methods.
31005497|a|OBJECTIVE: Medical schools are often blamed for inadequately training doctors on delirium. This study assesses the knowledge of medical students regarding delirium and evaluates different teaching methods for comparing learning outcomes. METHODS: A video, a handout, and a video+handout were used as three different teaching methods. Students were randomly assigned to three groups and pre- and postintervention knowledge gains were compared. Interventions were held between 2015 and 2018 at the University of Heidelberg Medical School in Germany. Seventy-eight (video intervention 33; handout 26; video+handout 19) sixth-year medical students participated. Participants learned about delirium with the help of a video, a handout, and both a video+handout at the start of one-hour lectures dedicated to teaching about delirium. Pre- and postintervention questionnaires, comprising five multiple-choice questions and a self-estimated grade of knowledge about delirium, were used. Variables calculated were objective and subjective knowledge, recall, and accuracy of self-assessment. Microsoft Excel and analysis of covariance were used to analyze data. RESULTS: Knowledge gains for all interventions were large (d>0.8) irrespective of gender. Post hoc comparison showed video and video+handout methods were more effective with high recall for video (92.8%). Students rated their knowledge as satisfactory, although they scored 11.4 out of 20. Preintervention knowledge level was correctly estimated by 31% of students, and postintervention by 40.3% students. CONCLUSION: Teaching about delirium to medical students with a video resulted in better knowledge transfer and recall. Most medical students, particularly men, overestimated their knowledge about delirium.
