38313441|t|Clinical Features and Prognosis of Coronavirus Disease 2019-Related Psychosis: A Retrospective Case Series.
38313441|a|Background: It has been reported that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may cause psychiatric disorders, but there are too many confounding factors in the various studies, making it difficult to draw accurate conclusions. Methods: We analyzed the clinical features and treatment of patients with non-severe COVID-19 who were hospitalized in neurology and psychiatry departments due to acute psychiatric disorders and performed a descriptive analysis. Results: Of the 57 patients included, 65% were hospitalized in the neurology department. Eighty-two percent of the patients exhibited abnormal mental behavior 1 week or less after COVID-19 diagnosis, and more than 60% of the patients had normal electroencephalogram (EEG), head imaging, autoimmune encephalitis antibody, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) results. Abnormal EEG results included an increase in nonspecific slow waves, abnormal imaging results included small ischemic areas and lacunar infarctions, and abnormal CSF results included a slight increase in cell numbers and protein levels and an increase in pressure. After administering antipsychotic drugs and/or immunotherapy, 67% of the patients experienced improvement in their psychiatric disorders by the time of discharge. Thirty-nine percent of the patients were discharged without antipsychotic medication and experienced no relapse of psychiatric symptoms. Conclusion: Patients with non-severe COVID-19 and psychiatric disorders usually have a good prognosis and do not require long-term antipsychotic medication. Patients with uncontrollable mental symptoms experienced rapid remission after immunotherapy, suggesting that inflammation or the immune response may play an important role in the occurrence of simple acute psychiatric disorders caused by COVID-19.
