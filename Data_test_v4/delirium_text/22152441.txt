The history of ExDS, the clinical presentation, the pathophysiology, differential diagnoses and management options were discussed. Though the specific pathophysiological pathways of ExDS have yet to be formally defined, considerable research has been undertaken on this topic. It is important for law enforcement, medical and other healthcare professionals to be familiar with current knowledge about the syndrome. This paper summarizes the current state and knowledge of ExDS.
