28837083|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders over the age of 65 years old. Although several underlying mechanisms for explaining the pathogenesis of AD are elucidated, the effective supplements or drugs for the intervention of AD are still limited. Recently, impaired autophagy associated with miRNA dysfunction has been reported to involve in aging and aging-related neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, the activation of autophagy through effectively regulating miRNAs may become a potential target for the prevention or treatment of AD. Mounting evidence from in vitro and in vivo AD models has demonstrated that resveratrol, one of polyphenolic compounds, can exert neuroprotective role in neurodegenerative diseases especially AD. In this review, the regulation of miRNAs and autophagy using resveratrol during the prevention and treatment of AD are systematically discussed, which will be beneficial to establish a target for the direct link between pharmacological intervention and AD in the future.
