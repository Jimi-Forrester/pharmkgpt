33353564|a|Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a neuromuscular disease characterized by loss of lower motor neurons, which leads to proximal muscle weakness and atrophy. SMA is caused by reduced survival motor neuron (SMN) protein levels due to biallelic deletions or mutations in the SMN1 gene. When SMN levels fall under a certain threshold, a plethora of cellular pathways are disturbed, including RNA processing, protein synthesis, metabolic defects, and mitochondrial function. Dysfunctional mitochondria can harm cells by decreased ATP production and increased oxidative stress due to elevated cellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Since neurons mainly produce energy via mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, restoring metabolic/oxidative homeostasis might rescue SMA pathology. Here, we report, based on proteome analysis, that SMA motor neurons show disturbed energy homeostasis due to dysfunction of mitochondrial complex I. This results in a lower basal ATP concentration and higher ROS production that causes an increase of protein carbonylation and impaired protein synthesis in SMA motor neurons. Counteracting these cellular impairments with pyruvate reduces elevated ROS levels, increases ATP and SMN protein levels in SMA motor neurons. Furthermore, we found that pyruvate-mediated SMN protein synthesis is mTOR-dependent. Most importantly, we showed that ROS regulates protein synthesis at the translational initiation step, which is impaired in SMA. As many neuropathies share pathological phenotypes such as dysfunctional mitochondria, excessive ROS, and impaired protein synthesis, our findings suggest new molecular interactions among these pathways. Additionally, counteracting these impairments by reducing ROS and increasing ATP might be beneficial for motor neuron survival in SMA patients.
