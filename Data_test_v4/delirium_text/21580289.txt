21580289|t|3-Benzyl-6-benzyl-amino-1-methyl-5-nitro-1,2,3,4-tetra-hydro-pyrimidine.
21580289|a|In the title compound, C(19)H(22)N(4)O(2), the tetra-hydro-pyrimidine ring adopts an envelope conformation (with the N atom connected to the benzyl group representing the flap). This benzyl group occupies a quasi-axial position. The two benzyl groups lie over the tetra-hydro-pyridimidine ring. The amino group is a hydrogen-bond donor to the nitro group.
