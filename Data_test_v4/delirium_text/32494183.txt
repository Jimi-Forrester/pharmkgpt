32494183|a|INTRODUCTION: Depression is one of the most common neuropsychiatric illnesses which leads to a huge social and economic burden on modern society. So, it is necessary to develop an effective and safe pharmacological intervention for depression. Accumulating evidence has shown that adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase/sirtuin 1 (AMPK/SIRT1) signaling pathway plays a pivotal role in the development of depression. Our present study aimed to investigate the antidepressant effect and possible mechanisms of salvianolic acid B (SalB) in a chronic mild stress (CMS)-induced depression model in rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The rats were randomly divided into three groups: control group with no stressor, CMS group and CMS+SalB (30 mg/kg/d) group. After administration for 28 consecutive days, the behavior tests were performed. The rats were sacrificed after behavior tests, and the brain tissues were collected for biochemical analysis. RESULTS: It was observed that the administration of SalB for 28 consecutive days successfully corrected the depressive-like behaviors in CMS-treated rats. SalB could effectively reduce the gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), as well as nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) p65 protein. In addition, inhibitor of NF-kappaB (IkappaB) protein expression was significantly increased after the administration of SalB. Moreover, SalB could effectively decrease protein expression of oxidative stress markers such as 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) and malondialdehyde (MDA) and increase the activity of catalase (CAT). SalB treatment also reversed CMS-induced inhibition of Nrf2 signaling pathway, along with increasing the mRNA expression of NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase (NQO-1) and heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1). Regarding the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress markers, the protein expressions of C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP) and glucose-regulated protein 78 kD (GRP78) were also significantly reduced after SalB administration. Furthermore, the supplementation of SalB could effectively activate the AMPK/SIRT1 signaling pathway, which indicated significant increase in pAMPK/AMPK ratio and SIRT1 protein expression. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that SalB relieved CMS-induced depressive-like state through the mitigation of inflammatory status, oxidative stress, and the activation of AMPK/SIRT1 signaling pathway.
