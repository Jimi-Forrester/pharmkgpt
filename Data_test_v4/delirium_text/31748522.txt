31748522|t|Neuropathological characterization of Lemur tyrosine kinase 2 (LMTK2) in Alzheimer's disease and neocortical Lewy body disease.
31748522|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) and neocortical Lewy body disease (LBD) are the most common neurodegenerative dementias, with no available curative treatment. Elucidating pathomechanism and identifying novel therapeutic targets are of paramount importance. Lemur tyrosine kinase 2 (LMTK2) is involved in several physiological and pathological cellular processes. Herewith a neuropathological characterization is presented in AD and neocortical LBD samples using chromogenic and fluorescent LMTK2 immunohistochemistry on post-mortem brain tissues and compared them to age-matched controls (CNTs). LMTK2 immunopositivity was limited to the neuronal cytoplasm. Neurons, including tau-positive tangle-bearing ones, showed decreased chromogenic and immunofluorescent labelling in AD in every cortical layer compared to CNT and neocortical LBD. Digital image analysis was performed to measure the average immunopositivity of groups. Mean grey values were calculated for each group after measuring the grey scale LMTK2 signal intensity of each individual neuron. There was significant difference between the mean grey values of CNT vs. AD and neocortical LBD vs. AD. The moderate decrease in neocortical LBD suggests the effect of coexisting AD pathology. We provide neuropathological evidence on decreased neuronal LMTK2 immunolabelling in AD, with implications for pathogenesis.
