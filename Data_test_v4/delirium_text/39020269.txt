39020269|a|BACKGROUND: COVID-19 disease affected the cognitive level of institutionalized patients in nursing homes, especially in the older subjects regardless of gender. This study aims to assess cognitive impairment using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) before and after COVID-19 infection, and to determine whether these changes varied based on gender. METHODS: A pre- and post-COVID-19 study was conducted, involving 68 geriatric patients (34 men and 34 women) from two nursing homes. Cognitive impairment was assessed using the MMSE. RESULTS: COVID-19 infection had a notable impact on the cognitive health of older adults residing in nursing homes, primarily attributed to the social isolation they experienced. This effect was more pronounced in older individuals. A comparison of the MMSE results by gender before and after contracting COVID-19 revealed significant differences in attention and calculation, with women obtaining the worst score before the virus. However, following their recovery from the virus, men demonstrated significantly lower scores in time and space orientation and evocation. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 has led to a decline in cognitive functioning, significantly worsening the mental state of older individuals, even after recovery from the virus. Consequently, it is crucial to implement proactive measures to prevent isolation and safeguard the cognitive well-being of this vulnerable population.
