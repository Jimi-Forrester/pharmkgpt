37570372|a|The aging of the world's population and the health problems accompanying it are becoming increasingly severe. Healthcare policies in developed countries focus on how to prevent and treat diseases associated with aging and how to maintain quality of life. Typical age-related diseases include deafness, cataracts, osteoarthritis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, and dementia. Although the mechanisms by which these diseases develop differ, they are all caused by the accumulation of molecular and cellular damage over time. In addition, age-related diseases can cause a decline in physical and mental functions and the ability to perform activities of daily living, as well as the loss of roles in society and a sense of fulfillment in life. Therefore, there is a need for treatment and measures to accurately grasp and maintain quality of life. This review aims to introduce areas and representative papers expected to be contributed to the special issue of "Aging and Quality of Life".
