37744807|t|Aminochalcones Attenuate Neuronal Cell Death under Oxidative Damage via Sirtuin 1 Activity.
37744807|a|Encouraged by the lack of effective treatments and the dramatic growth in the global prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases along with various pharmacological properties of chalcone pharmacophores, this study focused on the development of aminochalcone-based compounds, organic molecules characterized by a chalcone backbone (consisting of two aromatic rings connected by a three-carbon alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl system) with an amino group attached to one of the aromatic rings, as potential neuroprotective agents. Thus, the aminochalcone-based compounds in this study were designed by bearing a -OCH3 moiety at different positions on the ring and synthesized by the Claisen-Schmidt condensation. The compounds exhibited strong neuroprotective effects against hydrogen peroxide-induced neuronal death in the human neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) cell line (i.e., by improving cell survival, reducing reactive oxygen species production, maintaining mitochondrial function, and preventing cell membrane damage). The aminochalcone-based compounds showed mild toxicity toward a normal embryonic lung cell line (MRC-5) and a human neuroblastoma cell line, and were predicted to have preferable pharmacokinetic profiles with potential for oral administration. Molecular docking simulation indicated that the studied aminochalcones may act as competitive activators of the well-known protective protein, SIRT1, and provided beneficial knowledge regarding the essential key chemical moieties and interacting amino acid residues. Collectively, this work provides a series of four promising candidate agents that could be developed for neuroprotection.
