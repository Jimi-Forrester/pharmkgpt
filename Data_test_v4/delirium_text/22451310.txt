22451310|a|The Inferior parietal cortex (IPC), including the intraparietal sulcus (IPS), angular gyrus (AG), and supramarginal gyrus (SG), plays an important role in episodic memory, and is considered to be one of the specific neuroimaging markers in predicting the conversion of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, it is still unclear whether the connectivity of the IPC is impaired in MCI patients. In the present study, we used resting state fMRI to examine the functional connectivity of the three subdivisions of the IPC in MCI patients after controlling the impact of regional grey matter atrophy. It was found that, using IPS, AG, and SG as seeds of functional connectivity, three canonical functional networks could be correspondingly traced, i.e., executive control network (ECN), default mode network (DMN), and salience network (SN), and the three networks are differently altered in MCI patients. In contrast to the healthy controls, it was found that in MCI patients: 1) AG connectivity was significantly reduced within the DMN; 2) IPS showed decreased connectivity with the right inferior frontal gyrus while showing increased connectivity with the left frontal regions within the ECN; and 3) SG displayed decreased connectivity with a distribution of regions including the frontal and parietal regions, and increased connectivity with some sub-cortical areas within the SN. Moreover, the connectivity within the three networks was correlated with episodic memory and general cognitive impairment in MCI patients. These results extend well beyond the DMN, and further suggest that MCI is associated with alteration of large-scale functional brain networks.
