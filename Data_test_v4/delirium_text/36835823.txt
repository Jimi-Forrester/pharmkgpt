36835823|t|Heterogeneity of Ocular Hemodynamic Biomarkers among Open Angle Glaucoma Patients of African and European Descent.
36835823|a|This study investigated the heterogeneity of ocular hemodynamic biomarkers in early open angle glaucoma (OAG) patients and healthy controls of African (AD) and European descent (ED). Sixty OAG patients (38 ED, 22 AD) and 65 healthy controls (47 ED, 18 AD) participated in a prospective, cross-sectional study assessing: intraocular pressure (IOP), blood pressure (BP), ocular perfusion pressure (OPP), visual field (VF) and vascular densities (VD) via optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA). Comparisons between outcomes were adjusted for age, diabetes status and BP. VF, IOP, BP and OPP were not significantly different between OAG subgroups or controls. Multiple VD biomarkers were significantly lower in OAG patients of ED (p < 0.05) while central macular VD was lower in OAG patients of AD vs. OAG patients of ED (p = 0.024). Macular and parafoveal thickness were significantly lower in AD OAG patients compared to those of ED (p = 0.006-0.049). OAG patients of AD had a negative correlation between IOP and VF index (r = -0.86) while ED patients had a slightly positive relationship (r = 0.26); difference between groups (p < 0.001). Age-adjusted OCTA biomarkers exhibit significant variation in early OAG patients of AD and ED.
