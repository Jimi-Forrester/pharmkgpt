36070064|t|Radiological assessment of dementia: the Italian inter-society consensus for a practical and clinically oriented guide to image acquisition, evaluation, and reporting.
36070064|a|BACKGROUND: Radiological evaluation of dementia is expected to increase more and more in routine practice due to both the primary role of neuroimaging in the diagnostic pathway and the increasing incidence of the disease. Despite this, radiologists often do not follow a disease-oriented approach to image interpretation, for several reasons, leading to reports of limited value to clinicians. In our work, through an intersocietal consensus on the main mandatory knowledge about dementia, we proposed a disease-oriented protocol to optimize and standardize the acquisition/evaluation/interpretation and reporting of radiological images. Our main purpose is to provide a practical guideline for the radiologist to help increase the effectiveness of interdisciplinary dialogue and diagnostic accuracy in daily practice. RESULTS: We defined key clinical and imaging features of the dementias (A), recommended MRI protocol (B), proposed a disease-oriented imaging evaluation and interpretation (C) and report (D) with a glimpse to future avenues (E). The proposed radiological practice is to systematically evaluate and score atrophy, white matter changes, microbleeds, small vessel disease, consider the use of quantitative measures using commercial software tools critically, and adopt a structured disease-oriented report. In the expanding field of cognitive disorders, the only effective assessment approach is the standardized disease-oriented one, which includes a multidisciplinary integration of the clinical picture, MRI, CSF and blood biomarkers and nuclear medicine.
