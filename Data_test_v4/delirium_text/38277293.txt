38277293|t|RNA Analysis of Circulating Leukocytes in Patients with Alzheimer's Disease.
38277293|a|Background: One of the key symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the impairment of short-term memory. Hippocampal neurogenesis is essential for short-term memory and is known to decrease in patients with AD. Impaired short-term memory and impaired neurogenesis are observed in aged mice alongside changes in RNA expression of gap junction and metabolism-related genes in circulating leukocytes. Moreover, after penetrating the blood-brain barrier via the SDF1/CXCR4 axis, circulating leukocytes directly interact with hippocampal neuronal stem cells via gap junctions. Objective: Evaluation of RNA expression profiles in circulating leukocytes in patients with AD. Methods: Patients with AD (MMSE 23, n = 10) and age-matched controls (MMSE 28, n = 10) were enrolled into this study. RNA expression profiles of gap junction and metabolism-related genes in circulating leukocytes were compared between the groups (jRCT: 1050210166). Results: The ratios of gap junction and metabolism-related genes were significantly different between patients with AD and age-matched controls. However, due to large inter-individual variations, there were no statistically significant differences in the level of single RNA expression between these groups. Conclusions: Our findings suggest a potential connection between the presence of circulating leukocytes and the process of hippocampal neurogenesis in individuals with AD. Analyzing RNA in circulating leukocytes holds promise as a means to offer novel insights into the pathology of AD, distinct from conventional markers.
