38761612|a|BACKGROUND: Post-intensive care syndrome is a new or worsening persistent deterioration in cognitive, mental, and/or physical health following a prolonged admission to an intensive care unit. Post-intensive care syndrome remains underexplored following cardiac surgery, with a lack of understanding of the incidence and tools used to measure the symptoms. A scoping review was conducted to determine the incidence and to identify the tools commonly used to measure symptoms of post-intensive care syndrome following cardiac surgery. METHODS: The electronic databases Medline (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid), PsycINFO (Ovid), Scopus, and CINAHL (EBSCOhost) and Google Scholar were searched with keywords and controlled vocabulary to describe both cardiac surgery and post-intensive care syndrome (cardiac surgical procedures, heart surgery, and post-intensive care symptoms) and symptoms (delirium, depression, mobility and quality of life). Included were articles written in English and published after 2005 that described cognitive, mental, and physical symptoms of post-intensive care syndrome following cardiac surgery. 3,131 articles were found, with 565 duplicates, leaving 2,566 articles to be screened. Of these, seven unique studies were included. RESULTS: Five studies explored cognitive health, three mental health, one cognitive and mental health, and none physical health. No identified studies reported the overall incidence of post-intensive care syndrome following cardiac surgery. The incidence of cognitive health issues ranged from 21% to 38%, and mental health issues ranged from 16% to 99%. In total, 17 different tools were identified - 14 for cognitive health and three for mental health. No identified studies used the same tools to measure symptoms. No single tool was found to measure all three domains. CONCLUSION: This scoping review identified a literature gap specific to the incidence and inconsistency of assessment tools for post-intensive care syndrome in cardiac surgery patients. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: This work impacts clinical practice for the bedside nurse by raising awareness of an emerging health issue.
