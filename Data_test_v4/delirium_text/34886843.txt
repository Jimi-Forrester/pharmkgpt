34886843|t|Association of circulating let-7b-5p with major depressive disorder: a nested case-control study.
34886843|a|BACKGROUND: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the most common psychiatric disorders and is a great disease burden. However, its underlying pathophysiology and aetiology remain poorly understood. Available evidence suggests that circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) are associated with MDD, but it is still unknown whether miRNAs can predict subsequent incident MDD. METHODS: In this nested case-control study, a total of 104 individuals, who were free of MDD at baseline, from the Women's Health in Lund Area (WHILA) cohort were included. Among them, 52 individuals developed MDD (cases) during the 5 years follow-up and 52 individuals did not develop MDD (controls). Plasma expression levels of miR-17-5p, miR-134-5p, miR-144-5p, let-7b-5p and let-7c-5p at baseline were assessed using qRT-PCR. Logistic regression was used to estimate the odds of developing MDD among individuals with different levels of miRNA expression. RESULTS: Plasma expression levels of let-7b-5p were significantly lower (p = 0.02) at baseline in cases compared to controls. After adjustment for age and BMI, let-7b-5p was negatively associated with odds for developing MDD (OR = 0.33, p = 0.03, 95% CI = 0.12-0.91). Moreover, let-7b-5p expression levels showed a trend over time with larger differences between cases and controls for the earlier cases (MDD diagnosis <2 years from baseline) than MDD cases developed later (MDD diagnosis 2-5 years from baseline). CONCLUSIONS: These findings show that lower plasma levels of let-7b-5p are associated with a higher future risk of MDD. Results need to be validated in a large cohort to examine its potential as a peripheral biomarker for MDD.
