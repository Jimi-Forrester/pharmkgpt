38147506|t|From Fundamental Amyloid Protein Self-Assembly to Development of Bioplastics.
38147506|a|Proteins can self-assemble into a range of nanostructures as a result of molecular interactions. Amyloid nanofibrils, as one of them, were first discovered with regard to the relevance of neurodegenerative diseases but now have been exploited as building blocks to generate multiscale materials with designed functions for versatile applications. This review interconnects the mechanism of amyloid fibrillation, the current approaches to synthesizing amyloid protein-based materials, and the application in bioplastic development. We focus on the fundamental structures of self-assembled amyloid fibrils and how external factors can affect protein aggregation to optimize the process. Protein self-assembly is essentially the autonomous congregation of smaller protein units into larger, organized structures. Since the properties of the self-assembly can be manipulated by changing intrinsic factors and external conditions, protein self-assembly serves as an excellent building block for bioplastic development. Building on these principles, general processing methods and pathways from raw protein sources to mature state materials are proposed, providing a guide for the development of large-scale production. Additionally, this review discusses the diverse properties of protein-based amyloid nanofibrils and how they can be utilized as bioplastics. The economic feasibility of the protein bioplastics is also compared to conventional plastics in large-scale production scenarios, supporting their potential as sustainable bioplastics for future applications.
