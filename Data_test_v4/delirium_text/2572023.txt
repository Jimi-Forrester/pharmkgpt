2572023|a|UNLABELLED: Benzodiazepine (BD) misuse and dependence in 80 patients, 1974-1983 undergoing withdrawal treatment, were investigated by means of case histories and catamnestic inquiries. RESULTS: Three fourth of the patients were women. Many of the patients suffered from disturbed matrimonial relations, and 36 lived unmarried, divorced, or widowed. Besides, among the men frequently vocational difficulties were found, which increased in the course of BD-taking. In particular after removal of Lorazepam or Bromazepam in 58 cases withdrawal symptoms appeared, among them seven times delirium and six times epileptic seizures (grand mal). Catamnestic inquiries were practicable in 51 patients. 20 of them had required no further treatment, while 18 took again BD. But only 3 still proved to be as well psychical as physical dependent, in contrast to 14 before withdrawal treatment. Among the 15 only psychical dependent patients 8 merely showed a low dose dependence. Hence BD-dependence proves to be remediable, and subsequently shows only little tendency to relapse.
