The current treatment provides only symptomatic relief, and thus, disease-modifying therapies targeting underlying causes are needed. Although several potential therapies are in various stages of clinical trials, bringing a new Alzheimer's drug to market remains challenging. Hence, researchers are also exploring monoclonal antibodies, tau protein inhibitors, and anti-inflammatory drugs as treatment options. Conventionally designed dosage forms come with limitations like poor absorption, first-pass metabolism, and low bioavailability. They also cause systemic adverse effects because these designed systems do not provide target- specific drug delivery. Thus, in this review, the authors highlighted the current advancements in the development of intranasal nanoformulations for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. This strategy of delivering anti-Alzheimer drugs through the nasal route may help to target the drug exactly to the brain, achieve rapid onset of action, avoid first-pass metabolism, and reduce the side effects and dose required for administration. CONCLUSION: Delivering drugs to the brain through the nasal route for treating Alzheimer's disease is crucial due to the limited efficacy of existing treatments and the profound impact of the disease on patients and their families. Thus, by exploring innovative approaches such as nose-to-brain drug delivery, it is possible to improve the quality of life for individuals living with Alzheimer's and alleviate its societal burden.
