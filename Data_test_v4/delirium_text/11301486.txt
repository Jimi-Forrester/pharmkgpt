11301486|t|Innervation of cerebral blood vessels: morphology, plasticity, age-related, and Alzheimer's disease-related neurodegeneration.
11301486|a|The light microscopical and ultrastructural morphology of the innervation of the major cerebral arteries and pial vessels is described, including the origins of the different groups of nerve fibres and their characteristic neurotransmitter phenotype. Species and region specific variations are described and novel data regarding the parasympathetic innervation of cerebral vessels are presented. The dynamic nature, or plasticity, of cerebrovascular innervation is emphasized in describing changes affecting particular subpopulations of neurons during normal ageing and in Alzheimer's disease. The molecular controls on plasticity are discussed with particular reference to target-associated factors such as the neurotrophins and their neuronal receptors, as well as extracellular matrix related factors such as laminin. Hypotheses are presented regarding the principal extrinsic and intrinsic influences on plasticity of the cerebrovascular innervation.
