39557924|t|A study on the effect of Hypericum perforatum L. extract on vanadium toxicity in Allium cepa L.
39557924|a|The growth of industrialization growth the risk of vanadium (V) contamination. The objective of this study was to examine the impact of 200 microg L- 1 VCI3 -induced toxicity as well as the potential protective effect of 187.5 mg L- 1 and 375 mg L- 1Hypericum perforatum (H. perforatum) extracts against this toxicity on the Allium cepa (A. cepa) model organism. For this purpose, a series of investigations were conducted on the growth physiology alterations (germination percentage, root elongation, weight gain), cytogenetic alterations (mitotic index, micronucleus, chromosomal aberrations), biochemical alterations (malondialdehyde, superoxide dismutase, catalase) and defects in meristematic tissue in A. cepa. In addition, the phenolic compound content of H. perforatum extract was determined by the LC/MS-MS method. V application negatively affected all the investigated parameters and caused a serious phytotoxic and genotoxic effect as well as oxidative stress in A. cepa. Conversely, no statistical difference was observed between the parameters of the groups treated with H. perforatum extract and those of the control group. The administration of H. perforatum extract combined with V resulted in a notable enhancement in germination percentage, root elongation, weight gain, mitotic index value, chlorophyll a level and chlorophyll b level. Additionally, it led to a reduction in micronucleus and chromosomal aberrations frequencies, as well as meristematic tissue defects. Furthermore, LC/MS-MS analysis demonstrated that H. perforatum extract contains phenolic compounds, including catechin, epicatechin, quercetin, oleuropein and rutin, which confer antioxidant properties to the extract. The study provided clear evidence that H. perforatum extract attenuates the toxic effects of V in A. cepa, which can be attributed to its high content of bioactive phenols. The findings of the study indicate that H. perforatum extract may serve as a protective natural agent for daily use against heavy metal toxicity.
