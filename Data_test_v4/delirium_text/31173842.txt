31173842|t|A comparison of the prevalence of orthostatic hypotension between older patients with Alzheimer's Disease, Lewy body dementia, and without dementia.
31173842|a|Orthostatic hypotension (OH) is reported to be more prevalent particularly in patients with Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) because of the autonomic dysfunction, but prevalence of OH is not known in patients with Alzheimer Disease (AD). The aim of the present study was to determine whether OH can be used to distinguish DLB from AD. 38 patients with DLB, 88 patients with AD and 521 patients without dementia, underwent Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment. OH were evaluated for the 1st (OH1) and 3rd (OH3) minutes, taking the data in supine position as the basis, by Head-Up-Tilt Test. Prevalence of OH1 was 43.2% in AD, 44.7% in DLB and 17.9% in patients without dementia, and OH3 was 44.3% in AD, 47.4% in DLB and 17.9% in non-dementia group. The frequency of OH1 and OH3 was higher in the AD and DLB groups than in the patients without dementia (p < 0.001), but there was no significant difference between DLB and AD in terms of OH (p > 0.05). The percentage of asymptomatic patients with OH was 87.2% and 89.6% during 1st and 3rd minutes, respectively, and this percentage was similar in three groups (p > 0.05, for each). There was no significant difference between the two dementia groups in terms of comorbidities, drugs and laboratory values (p > 0.05). OH is more prevalent in patients with AD than controls and similar levels are observed in those with DLB. The prevalence of OH equally is greater with DLB or AD disease progression. Clinicians should be aware of OH and its related consequences in the management of the AD in older adults.
