31101104|a|BACKGROUND: Simultaneous development of thyroid storm and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a rare condition. The review aims to summarise its clinical presentation, investigation findings and treatment options. METHODS: Databases and reference lists of the selected articles were searched for case reports in English which describe concurrent presentation of thyroid storm and diabetic ketoacidosis. CARE guidelines were used for the quality assessment of the selected articles. RESULTS: Twenty-six cases from twenty-one articles were selected out of 198 search results. Western Pacific, and American regions contributed to 77% of the cases. Females were most affected (88%). Features of Graves' disease like hyperthermia and tachycardia, gastrointestinal and neuro-psychiatric disturbances were the common clinical presentations. In most of the cases, previous diagnosis of diabetes mellitus preceded that of Graves' disease (46%). Among patients having their drug compliance reported, all had poor compliance to their routine anti-thyroid (9/9) and anti-diabetic (2/2) agents. Moreover, in all cases where HbA1C (7/7) and T4 (16/16) were measured, the results were elevated and where TSH (17/17) was measured, the results were low. The recommended treatment for DKA and thyroid storm was used in most cases and methimazole was the thionamide of choice in the latest four cases reported. All cases survived except four (15%). CONCLUSIONS: Concurrent presentation of thyroid storm and diabetic ketoacidosis is rare but life-threatening. Therefore, efforts should be made to maximise patient compliance to anti-thyroid and anti-diabetic agents in treating such patients.
