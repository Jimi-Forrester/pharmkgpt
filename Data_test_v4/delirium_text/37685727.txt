37685727|a|Studies have reported inconclusive results regarding the effectiveness and clinical indications of the exclusive use of human-robotic interactive gait training (HIT) in patients with post-stroke dementia (PSD). This study aimed to compare the effects of human-robotic interactive gait training (HIT) and conventional physiotherapy (CPT) on cognitive and sensorimotor functions, trunk balance and coordination, dynamic and static balance, and activities related to daily living performance in patients with PSD. Forty-eight patients with PSD who received 60-minute therapy sessions three times per week for 6 weeks were assigned to either the CPT (n = 25) or HIT (n = 23) group. The clinical outcomes included the scores of the mini-mental state examination (MMSE), Fugl-Meyer assessment (FMA), trunk impairment scale (TIS), Berg balance scale (BBS), and modified Barthel index (MBI). Friedman tests were conducted at p < 0.05. The Friedman tests showed that HIT had superior effects to CPT in relation to MMSE, FMA, and TIS (p < 0.05), but not in relation to BBS and MBI (p > 0.05). Our results provide promising clinical evidence that HIT significantly improves cognitive and sensorimotor recovery functions, as well as trunk balance and coordination, in patients with PSD who cannot concurrently perform dual cognitive-locomotor tasks.
