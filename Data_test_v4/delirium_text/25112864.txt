25112864|a|Alpha-synuclein (alpha-Syn) aggregates are the main component of Lewy bodies, which are the characteristic pathological feature in Parkinson's disease (PD) brain. Evidence that alpha-Syn aggregation can be propagated between neurones has led to the suggestion that this mechanism is responsible for the stepwise progression of PD pathology. Decreasing alpha-Syn expression is predicted to attenuate this process and is thus an attractive approach to delay or halt PD progression. We have used alpha-Syn small interfering RNA (siRNA) to reduce total and aggregated alpha-Syn levels in mouse brains. To achieve widespread delivery of siRNAs to the brain we have peripherally injected modified exosomes expressing Ravies virus glycoprotein loaded with siRNA. Normal mice were analyzed 3 or 7 days after injection. To evaluate whether this approach can decrease alpha-Syn aggregates, we repeated the treatment using transgenic mice expressing the human phosphorylation-mimic S129D alpha-Syn, which exhibits aggregation. In normal mice we detected significantly reduced alpha-Syn messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels throughout the brain 3 and 7 days after treatment with RVG-exosomes loaded with siRNA to alpha-Syn. In S129D alpha-Syn transgenic mice we found a decreased alpha-Syn mRNA and protein levels throughout the brain 7 days after injection. This resulted in significant reductions in intraneuronal protein aggregates, including in dopaminergic neurones of the substantia nigra. This study highlights the therapeutic potential of RVG-exosome delivery of siRNA to delay and reverse brain alpha-Syn pathological conditions.
