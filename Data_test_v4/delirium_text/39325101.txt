39325101|a|L-type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1) is integral to the transport of large neutral amino acids across the blood-brain barrier (BBB), playing a crucial role in brain homeostasis and the delivery of therapeutic agents. This review explores the multifaceted role of LAT1 in neurological disorders, including its structural and functional aspects at the BBB. Studies using advanced BBB models, such as induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived systems and quantitative proteomic analyses, have demonstrated LAT1's significant impact on drug permeability and transport efficiency. In Alzheimer's disease, LAT1-mediated delivery of anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective agents shows promise in overcoming BBB limitations. In Parkinson's disease, LAT1's role in transporting L-DOPA and other therapeutic agents highlights its potential in enhancing treatment efficacy. In phenylketonuria, studies have revealed polymorphisms and genetic variations of LAT1, which could be correlated to disease severity. Prodrugs of valproic acid, pregabalin, and gabapentin help use LAT1-mediated transport to increase the therapeutic activity and bioavailability of the prodrug in the brain. LAT1 has also been studied in neurodevelopment disorders like autism spectrum disorders and Rett syndrome, along with neuropsychiatric implications in depression. Its implications in neuro-oncology, especially in transporting therapeutic agents into cancer cells, show immense future potential. Phenotypes of LAT1 have also shown variations in the general population affecting their ability to respond to painkillers and anti-inflammatory drugs. Furthermore, LAT1-targeted approaches, such as functionalized nanoparticles and prodrugs, show promise in overcoming chemoresistance and enhancing drug delivery to the brain. The ongoing exploration of LAT1's structural characteristics and therapeutic applications reiterates its critical role in advancing treatments for neurological disorders.
