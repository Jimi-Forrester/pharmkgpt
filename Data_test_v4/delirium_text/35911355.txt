35911355|t|Scrub Typhus Meningoencephalitis: Review of Literature and Unique Diagnostic & Management Challenges in Resource-Limited Settings.
35911355|a|Scrub typhus is a zoonotic febrile illness caused by Orientia tsutsugamushi and transmitted by Leptotrombidium larvae. Scrub typhus often presents with nonspecific clinical features, and ranges in severity from mild illness to multiorgan failure and fatality. The disease is primarily found in the Asia-Pacific rim, including India, Pakistan, Thailand, Malaysia, Korea, and China. Due to frequent limitations in healthcare resources in many of these countries, the diagnosis and management of scrub typhus meningoencephalitis pose unique challenges. This review focuses on the epidemiology, clinical features, diagnostic testing, and management modalities in such resource-limited settings. Exercising a high index of clinical suspicion and timely diagnostic tests and management strategies are vital to prevent life-threatening complications of this treatable illness.
