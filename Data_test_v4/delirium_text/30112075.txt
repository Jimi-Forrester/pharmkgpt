30112075|a|Gastric cancer is the second major cause of death associated with cancer and ranks among the top four cancers diagnosed worldwide. Previous findings identified the association of transmembrane proteins (TMEMs) with tumorigenesis of various types of cancer, including breast, liver and kidney cancer. However, the expression and the biological function of TMEMs, especially TMEM119, and its possible molecular mechanism in gastric cancer remain less understood. CCK-8 and flow cytometric analysis was employed to examine the viability and apoptosis of gastric adenocarcinoma SGC-7901 and AGS cells, gastric carcinoma MKN45 cells, as well as gastric epithelial cell lines GES-1 after transfection with TMEM119-siRNA (siTMEM119), respectively. Quantitative PCR, western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry was performed to detect the expression levels of TMEM119, Bax, Bcl-2 and caspase-3. The results showed that, TMEM119 was elevated with the highest expression detected in SGC-7901 cells compared to AGS cells, MKN45 cells, as well as GES-1. TMEM119 silencing in the gastric cancer cell line, SGC-7901, significantly inhibited cell viability and induced apoptosis. The downregulation of TMEM119 exhibited reduced levels of Bcl-2 and higher levels of Bax and caspase-3 in SGC-7901 cells. These results suggest that TMEM119 is useful in the treatment of gastric cancer.
