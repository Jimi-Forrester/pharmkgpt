8666864|t|[Analysis of specificity of resected esophageal cancer patients with a history of apoplexy].
8666864|a|We studied 15 resected cases with a history of apoplexy (2.5%) among 599 cases of esophageal cancer admitted between 1972 and 1993. Fourteen were male, and female, aged 48 to 77 years. Twelve had suffered from cerebral infarction, 2 intracerebral hemorrhage, and one subarachnoid hemorrhage. Duration from apoplexy to operation was between 2 months and 19 years in the cerebral infarction cases, between 8 and 10 years in the intracerebral hemorrhage cases and 4 years in the subarachnoid hemorrhage case. Preoperative neurological disturbance was found in 7 of the 12 cerebral infarction cases, and in both intracerebral hemorrhage cases. Four cases showed hemiplegia, and the other 5 cases showed partial paralysis of limbs. Preoperative complications were found in 7 of the 15 cases, and consisted of diabetes mellitus in 5, hypertension in 4, bronchial asthma in one, and renal dysfunction in one case. Intra- and postoperative complications were found in 11 of the 15 cases, and consisted of anastomotic leakage in 5, delirium in 3, apoplexy in 2, peritonitis in one, ARDS in one, intraoperative cardiac arrest in one, and wound infection in one. Postoperative disorders of consciousness were found in 5 cases, consisting of delirium in 3, and excitation at awakening of anethesia in 2 cases. Rate of direct operative death was 6.7% in preoperative apoplectic patients, and 8.5% in non-apoplectic patients, and there was no significant difference between the 2 groups. On the other hand, rate of postoperative apoplexy was 13.3% in the preoperative apoplectic patients, and 0.4% in non-apoplectic patients. There was a significant difference between them (p < 0.01). But they were cured of it, and left our hospital. It is concluded that active surgical treatment can be indicated for esophageal cancer patients with a history of apoplexy, if more attention is given to the management of diabetes mellitus or hypertension.
