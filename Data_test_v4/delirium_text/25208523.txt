25208523|a|Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3), particularly the isoform GSK3beta, has been implicated in a wide range of physiological systems and neurological disorders including Alzheimer's Disease. However, the functional importance of GSK3alpha has been largely untested. The multifunctionality of GSK3 limits its potential as a drug target because of inevitable side effects. Due to its greater expression in the CNS, GSK3beta rather than GSK3alpha has also been assumed to be of primary importance in synaptic plasticity. Here, we investigate bidirectional long-term synaptic plasticity in knockin mice with a point mutation in GSK3alpha or GSK3beta that prevents their inhibitory regulation. We report that only the mutation in GSK3alpha affects long-term potentiation (LTP) and depression (LTD). This stresses the importance of investigating isoform specificity for GSK3 in all systems and suggests that GSK3alpha should be investigated as a drug target in cognitive disorders including Alzheimer's Disease.
