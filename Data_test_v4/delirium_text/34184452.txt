34184452|t|Neurological Manifestations in Patients with COVID-19: Experiences from the Central Infectious Diseases Hospital in South Korea.
34184452|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To investigate the incidence and characteristics of neurological manifestations associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of the consecutive patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to the central infectious diseases hospital designated for the treatment of COVID-19 in South Korea between March 2020 and September 2020. Newly developed neurological manifestations associated with COVID-19 were investigated. The frequency and clinical features of the neurological manifestations were analyzed according to disease severity, which was classified according to World Health Organization interim guidance. RESULTS: Of the 306 symptomatic patients, 186 (60.8%) developed at least one neurological manifestation during hospitalization. The most common neurological symptom was headache (n=102, 33.3%), followed by myalgia (n=96, 31.4%) and anosmia/ageusia (n=54, 17.6%). Acute stroke (all ischemic stroke) occurred in three (1.0%) patients, and new-onset seizures occurred in two (0.7%). Neurological manifestation was a presenting symptom of COVID-19 in 72 (23.5%) patients, and was the only symptom of COVID-19 in 12 (3.9%). Stroke, seizure, and impaired consciousness were significantly associated with severe to critical COVID-19, whereas headache and anosmia/ageusia were frequently found in patients with mild to moderate disease. CONCLUSIONS: Neurological manifestations were commonly observed in patients with COVID-19. During the current pandemic, when patients present with new-onset neurological symptoms, COVID-19 may be considered as part of the differential diagnosis. Attention to severe neurological complications is needed, especially in patients with severe or critical COVID-19.
