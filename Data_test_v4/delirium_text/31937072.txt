31937072|a|PURPOSE: Upfront systemic chemotherapy with target agents has been recommended for patients with stage IV colon cancer. Some with partial response are considered for curative resection. There is high risk of developing postoperative complications following upfront systemic chemotherapy. We aimed to evaluate short-term perioperative outcomes of curative surgery after upfront chemotherapy in comparison with upfront surgery in patients with metastatic colon cancer. METHODS: Between January 2010 and October 2015, 146 patients (80 in the surgery first group, 66 in the upfront chemotherapy group) who underwent surgical resection before or after systemic chemotherapy for metastatic colon cancer were included in the present study. All decisions for treatment were made through a multidisciplinary team. Postoperative clinical outcomes and complications were analyzed to compare the groups. RESULTS: There was no difference between the 2 groups in terms of postoperative clinical outcomes. Overall complication rates were not different between the groups (surgery first group: 46.3% vs. upfront chemotherapy group: 60.6%; P = 0.084). When classified according to the Clavien-Dindo method, there was no difference between the 2 groups in terms of major complications (grade 3 or more) (surgery first group: 18.9% vs. upfront chemotherapy group: 27.5%; P = 0.374). CONCLUSION: There was no significant increase in major postoperative complications in metastatic colon cancer patients who received upfront chemotherapy followed by curative surgery. Careful patient selection and treatment planning are important.
