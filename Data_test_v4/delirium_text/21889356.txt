21889356|t|FKBP51 and FKBP52 in signaling and disease.
21889356|a|FKBP51 and FKBP52 are diverse regulators of steroid hormone receptor signaling, including receptor maturation, hormone binding and nuclear translocation. Although structurally similar, they are functionally divergent, which is largely attributed to differences in the FK1 domain and the proline-rich loop. FKBP51 and FKBP52 have emerged as likely contributors to a variety of hormone-dependent diseases, including stress-related diseases, immune function, reproductive functions and a variety of cancers. In addition, recent studies have implicated FKBP51 and FKBP52 in Alzheimer's disease and other protein aggregation disorders. This review summarizes our current understanding of FKBP51 and FKBP52 interactions within the receptor-chaperone complex, their contributions to health and disease, and their potential as therapeutic targets for the treatment of these diseases.
