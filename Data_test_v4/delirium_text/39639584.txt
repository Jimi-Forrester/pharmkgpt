OBJECTIVE: To examine the utilization and perceived value of technology-based solutions for caregiving among caregivers of PLWD. METHODS: In collaboration with three Texas sites, PLWD and family caregiver dyads were recruited from clinical and community sites to assess the feasibility of a caregiving technology. PLWDs were asked to wear a GPS-based wearable device, which was paired with caregivers' smartphone application, that enabled location monitoring and was equipped with call functions. After three months, researchers called caregivers to ask about their utilization of the "system" (i.e., wearable paired with smartphone application) and the perceived value of this technology. Forty-one caregivers completed follow-up telephone interviews. RESULTS: About 70% of caregivers reported their care recipient wore the wearable device daily, and 39.1% used the smartphone application daily. Approximately 31% of caregivers reported daily use of the tracking feature, 30.8% reported daily use of the "safe zone" feature (i.e., geo-fencing), and 17.1% reported daily use of the two-way calling feature. About 39% of caregivers were extremely satisfied with the "system," 43.6% found it extremely easy to use, and 46.2% found it extremely useful for caregiving. On average, caregivers with higher baseline Zarit Burden Interview scores found the "system" to be more useful with their caregiving (f = 5.97, p = 0.006) and were more satisfied with the "system" (f = 3.75, p = 0.034). CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest caregiver burden may drive the perceived usefulness of, and satisfaction with, technology-based solutions.
