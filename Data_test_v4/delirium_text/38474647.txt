38474647|t|Potential Anti-Inflammatory Constituents from Aesculus wilsonii Seeds.
38474647|a|A chemical study of Aesculus wilsonii Rehd. (also called Suo Luo Zi) and the in vitro anti-inflammatory effects of the obtained compounds was conducted. Retrieving results through SciFinder showed that there were four unreported compounds, aeswilosides I-IV (1-4), along with fourteen known isolates (5-18). Their structures were elucidated by extensive spectroscopic methods such as UV, IR, NMR, [alpha]D, and MS spectra, as well as acid hydrolysis. Among the known ones, compounds 5, 6, 8-10, and 12-16 were obtained from the Aesculus genus for the first time; compounds 7, 11, 17, and 18 were first identified from this plant. The NMR data of 5 and 18 were reported first. The effects of 1-18 on the release of nitric oxide (NO) from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced RAW264.7 cells were determined. The results showed that at concentrations of 10, 25, and 50 muM, the novel compounds, aeswilosides I (1) and IV (4), along with the known ones, 1-(2-methylbutyryl)phloroglucinyl-glucopyranoside (10) and pisuminic acid (15), displayed significant inhibitory effects on NO production in a concentration-dependent manner. It is worth mentioning that compound 10 showed the best NO inhibitory effect with a relative NO production of 88.1%, which was close to that of the positive drug dexamethasone. The Elisa experiment suggested that compounds 1, 4, 10, and 15 suppressed the release of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta as well. In conclusion, this study enriches the spectra of compounds with potential anti-inflammatory effects in A. wilsonii and provides new references for the discovery of anti-inflammatory lead compounds, but further mechanistic research is still needed.
