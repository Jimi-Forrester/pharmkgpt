38427240|t|Microglial Uptake of Extracellular Tau by Actin-Mediated Phagocytosis.
38427240|a|Microglia are scavengers of the brain environment that clear dead cells, debris, and microbes. In Alzheimer's disease, microglia get activated to phagocytose damaged neurons, extracellular Amyoid-beta, and Tau deposits. Several Tau internalization mechanisms of microglia have been studied which include phagocytosis, pinocytosis, and receptor-mediated endocytosis. In this chapter, we have visualized microglial phagocytic structures that are actin-rich cup-like extensions, which surrounds extracellular Tau species by wide-field fluorescence and confocal microscopy. We have shown the association of filamentous actin in Tau phagocytosis along the assembly of LC-3 molecules to phagosomes. The 3-dimensional, orthogonal and gallery wise representation of these phagocytic structures provides an overview of the phagocytic mechanism of extracellular Tau by microglia.
