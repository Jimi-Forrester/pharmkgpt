37485473|t|3D finite-element brain modeling of lateral ventricular wall loading to rationalize periventricular white matter hyperintensity locations.
37485473|a|Aging-related periventricular white matter hyperintensities (pvWMHs) are a common observation in medical images of the aging brain. The underlying tissue damage is part of the complex pathophysiology associated with age-related microstructural changes and cognitive decline. PvWMH formation is linked to blood-brain barrier dysfunction from cerebral small vessel disease as well as the accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid in periventricular tissue due to progressive denudation of the ventricular wall. In need of a unifying theory for pvWMH etiology, image-based finite-element modeling is used to demonstrate that ventricular expansion from age-related cerebral atrophy and hemodynamic loading leads to maximum mechanical loading of the ventricular wall in the same locations that show pvWMHs. Ventricular inflation, induced via pressurization of the ventricular wall, creates significant ventricular wall stretch and stress on the ependymal cells lining the wall, that are linked to cerebrospinal fluid leaking from the lateral ventricles into periventricular white matter tissue. Eight anatomically accurate 3D brain models of cognitively healthy subjects with a wide range of ventricular shapes are created. For all models, our simulations show that mechanomarkers of mechanical wall loading are consistently highest in pvWMHs locations (p < 0.05). Maximum principal strain, the ependymal cell thinning ratio, and wall curvature are on average 14%, 8%, and 24% higher in pvWMH regions compared to the remaining ventricular wall, respectively. Computational modeling provides a powerful framework to systematically study pvWMH formation and growth with the goal to develop pharmacological interventions in the future.
