20098234|a|Adequate treatment of behavioral disturbances in Alzheimer's disease is both important and difficult. This report describes a case series that examined the effectiveness and safety of low-dose divalproex in the treatment of agitated patients with Alzheimer's disease who were admitted to an inpatient geriatric psychiatry unit over a 1-year period. All patients had agitation due to probable Alzheimer's disease or mixed dementia and were prescribed divalproex monotherapy at low and completely flexible doses. Patients and nursing staff were blind to study enrollment. Clinical global impression scale scores, divalproex serum levels, and a variety of medical chart data were collected. Twenty patients met selection criteria and were included in the study. Of those, 13 patients (65%) were considered responders, while 4 patients (20%) required augmentation with other psychotropic medications; divalproex was discontinued in 1 patient. Adverse events occurred in 25% of patients. This case series suggests that low-dose divalproex may offer behavioral improvement and a reduced risk of side effects for some patients with agitation in Alzheimer's disease.
