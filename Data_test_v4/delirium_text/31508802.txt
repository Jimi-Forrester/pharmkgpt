31508802|a|Protein glycation and protein aggregation are two distinct phenomena being observed in cancer cells as factors promoting cancer cell viability. Protein aggregation is an abnormal interaction between proteins caused as a result of structural changes in them after any mutation or environmental assault. Protein aggregation is usually associated with neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, but of late, research findings have shown its association with the development of different cancers like lung, breast and ovarian cancer. On the contrary, protein glycation is a cascade of irreversible nonenzymatic reaction of reducing sugar with the amino group of the protein resulting in the modification of protein structure and formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs). These AGEs are reported to obstruct the normal function of proteins. Lately, it has been reported that protein aggregation occurs as a result of AGEs. This aggregation of protein promotes the transformation of healthy cells to neoplasia leading to tumorigenesis. In this review, we underline the current knowledge of protein aggregation and glycation along with the cross talk between the two, which may eventually lead to the development of cancer.
