39441220|a|BACKGROUND: With the advancement of cancer treatment, appropriate treatment for musculoskeletal problems is becoming more important as it extends the patient's lifespan and improves the quality of life. In surgical treatment for metastatic spine tumors (MST), various efforts are being considered to obtain a good prognosis. The purposes of this study are to analyze prognostic factors for postoperative ambulation and perioperative complications in patients surgically treated for MST with neurologic symptoms. METHODS: Seventy five cases of patients who underwent surgery for MST with neurologic symptoms were enrolled between December 2016 and January 2023. Postoperative ambulatory function and medical complications were assessed for each patient in this study. The endpoint of ambulatory function was defined as the best function among entire periods of follow-up outpatient visits. We defined the improvement of ambulatory function as improvement in Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scale. For complications, we applied complication classification system for orthopaedic surgery. Perioperative complications were defined as those requiring changes of treatment compared with routine postoperative treatment during patient's admission. Confirmed complications included expire, delirium, urinary tract infection (UTI), pneumonia, sepsis, bacteremia, acute kidney injury (AKI), chylothorax. Prognostic factors were collected and analyzed for relationship by logistic regression. RESULTS: Of the 75 cases, postoperatively 42 (56%) cases of patients were improved in Nurick grade, 36 (48%) cases of patients in ECOG performance. And 21 (28%) cases of patients were treated in intensive care unit (ICU) and 15 (20%) cases of patients suffered from major perioperative complications. Regression analysis showed that clinical factors such as ECOG, psoas muscle index (PMI) and prognostic nutritional index (PNI) were related to the improvement of ambulatory function and incidence of perioperative complications. On multivariate analysis, improvement of ambulatory function was associated with PMI (p = 0.014) and incidence of perioperative complications was associated with PNI (p = 0.045). CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative nutritional status and sarcopenia are related factors in the outcome of surgical treatment for MST, and preoperative efforts to improve these may be a way to obtain better clinical results.
