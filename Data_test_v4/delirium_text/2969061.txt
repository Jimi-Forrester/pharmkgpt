2969061|t|Lp(a) lipoprotein in cerebrovascular disease and dementia.
2969061|a|Lp(a) lipoprotein has been considered an independent risk factor in the development of coronary heart disease (CHD). We examined the role of Lp(a) in patients with cerebrovascular disease (CVD) and those with dementia. The Lp(a) concentration in patients with CHD, those with cerebral infarction due to a large artery occlusion and those with vascular dementia (VD) was significantly higher than that of age-matched control subjects. However, the Lp(a) concentration was not high in cerebral infarction due to a small artery occlusion, intracerebral hemorrhage and dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT). The present results suggest that Lp(a) should cause VD as well as CVD, and that Lp(a) should be one of the indicators that distinguish VD from DAT.
