38640157|t|Alzheimer's Disease in Lebanon: Exploring Genetic and Environmental Risk Factors-A Comprehensive Review.
38640157|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative condition that displays a high prevalence in Lebanon causing a local burden in healthcare and socio-economic sectors. Unfortunately, the lack of prevalence studies and clinical trials in Lebanon minimizes the improvement of AD patient health status. In this review, we include over 155 articles to cover the different aspects of AD ranging from mechanisms to possible treatment and management tools. We highlight some important modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors of the disease including genetics, age, cardiovascular diseases, smoking, etc. Finally, we propose a hypothetical genetic synergy model between APOE4 and TREM2 genes which constitutes a potential early diagnostic tool that helps in reducing the risk of AD based on preventative measures decades before cognitive decline. The studies on AD in Lebanon and the Middle East are scarce. This review points out the importance of genetic mapping in the understanding of disease pathology which is crucial for the emergence of novel diagnostic tools. Hence, we establish a rigid basis for further research to identify the most influential genetic and environmental risk factors for the purpose of using more specific diagnostic tools and possibly adopting a local management protocol.
