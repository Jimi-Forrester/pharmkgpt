35691989|a|The apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) genotype is one of the strongest genetic risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD), and is generally believed to cause widespread pathological alterations in various types of brain cells. Here, we developed a novel engineering method of creating the chimeric human cerebral organoids (chCOs) to assess the differential roles of APOE4 in neurons and astrocytes. First, the astrogenic factors NFIB and SOX9 were introduced into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to accelerate the induction of astrocytes. Then the above induced iPSCs were mixed and cocultured with noninfected iPSCs under the standard culturing condition of cerebral organoids. As anticipated, the functional astrocytes were detected as early as 45 days, and it helped more neurons matured in chCOs in comparation of the control human cerebral organoids (hCOs). More interestingly, this method enabled us to generate chCOs containing neurons and astrocytes with different genotypes, namely APOE3 or APOE4. Then, it was found in chCOs that astrocytic APOE4 already significantly promoted lipid droplet formation and cholesterol accumulation in neurons while both astrocytic and neuronal APOE4 contributed to the maximum effect. Most notably, we observed that the co-occurrence of astrocytic and neuronal APOE4 were required to elevate neuronal phosphorylated tau levels in chCOs while Abeta levels were increased in chCOs with neuronal APOE4. Altogether, our results not only revealed the essence of both neuronal and astrocytic APOE4 for tau pathology, but also suggested chCOs as a valuable pathological model for AD research and drug discovery.
