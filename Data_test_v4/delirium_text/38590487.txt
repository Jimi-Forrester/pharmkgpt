38590487|a|BACKGROUND: The procedure of hip fracture repair poses a risk for postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) in elderly patients, accompanied by anesthesia and operations. Various noninvasive methods of respiratory support are used as prophylactic and therapeutic, mainly in the postoperative period.  Objective: This study aims to determine whether intraoperative use of a high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) impacts elderly patient outcomes after hip fracture surgery. METHOD: Seventy patients aged 65 and older undergoing traumatic hip surgery under spinal anesthesia for isolated hip fractures were randomly assigned to either an interventional group (I) utilizing a high-flow nasal cannula or a control group (C) without respiratory intervention in a six-month single-blind controlled study at Sahloul Teaching Hospital. RESULTS: The two groups had identical socio-demographic traits and baseline data. Respiratory postoperative complications occurred in two patients in group (I) and in nine patients in group (C), with a significant difference (p = 0.023). The main respiratory postoperative complications in group (I) were atelectasis (one case) and pulmonary edema (one case). The main respiratory postoperative complications in group (C) were atelectasis (four cases), pneumonia (two cases), COPD decompensation (two cases), and pulmonary edema (one case). No intensive care unit admissions or intraoperative complications were associated with using HFNC. The mean length of stay (LOS) in the hospital was 8.83 +- 2.91 for group I and 10.46 +- 3.4 for group (C), which differed significantly (p = 0.03) with no in-hospital mortality for the two groups. CONCLUSION: The intraoperative administration of HFNC may lower the incidence of postoperative respiratory complications and the duration of hospital stays.
