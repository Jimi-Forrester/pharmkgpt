38452574|a|Oddball task-related EEG delta and theta responses are associated with frontal executive functions, which are significantly impaired in patients with dementia due to Parkinson's disease (PDD) and Lewy bodies (DLB). The present study investigated the oddball task-related EEG delta and theta responses in patients with PDD, DLB, and Alzheimer's disease dementia (ADD). During visual and auditory oddball paradigms, EEG activity was recorded in 20 ADD, 17 DLB, 20 PDD, and 20 healthy (HC) older adults. Event-related EEG power spectrum and phase-locking analysis were performed at the delta (1-4 Hz) and theta (4-7 Hz) frequency bands for target and nontarget stimuli. Compared to the HC persons, dementia groups showed lower frontal and central delta and theta power and phase-locking associated with task performance and neuropsychological test scores. Notably, this effect was more significant in the PDD and DLB than in the ADD. In conclusion, oddball task-related frontal and central EEG delta and theta responses may reflect frontal supramodal executive dysfunctions in PDD and DLB patients.
