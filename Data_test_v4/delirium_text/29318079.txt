29318079|a|AIMS: To examine the association of patient-related factors with the effect of an in-hospital comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) on hip fracture mortality. METHODS: Population-based, prospective data were collected on 1425 consecutive hip fracture patients aged >=65 in a central hospital providing orthogeriatric service. Outcome was mortality at 1 month after hip fracture associated with receiving versus not receiving CGA. RESULTS: Of the patients receiving CGA compared to those who did not, 8.5% versus12.0% had died within 1 month of the hip fracture (P = .028). In the age- and sex-adjusted Cox proportional hazards model, CGA was associated with a decreased risk of 1-month mortality in patients aged 80 to 89 years (hazard ratio [HR] 0.46, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.29-0.73), females (HR: 0.57, 95% CI: 0.38-0.86), having American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score 1 to 3 (HR: 0.60, 95% CI: 0.37-0.99), taking 4 to 10 daily medications (HR: 0.59, 95% CI: 0.38-0.91), with a diagnosis of memory disorder (HR: 0.50, 95% CI: 0.29-0.88), with an estimated glomerular filtration rate <30 mL/min/1.73m2 (HR: 0.28, 95% CI: 0.10-0.76), or living in an assisted living accommodation (HR: 0.40, 95% CI: 0.21-0.76). CONCLUSION: Several modifiable and patient-related factors were associated with decreased risk of 1-month mortality when CGA was performed during hospitalization for hip fracture. Between "younger and fitter" and "oldest and frailest," there is a large group of hip fracture patients whose survival can be improved by in-hospital CGA.
