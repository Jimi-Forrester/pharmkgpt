33066895|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We aimed to demonstrate the tolerability and feasibility and the effect of remote ischemic post-conditioning on cognitive functioning in patients with post-stroke cognitive impairment. METHODS: This was a single-center, randomized, outcome-blinded, placebo-controlled trial, randomized 1:1 to receive 4 cycles of remote ischemic post-conditioning or a sham procedure for 7 days. The primary outcome measure was tolerability and feasibility of remote ischemic post-conditioning. Secondary outcomes to measure the neurological function with national institute of health stroke scale and the cognitive impairment with Montreal Cognitive Assessment scale and Alzheimer's disease assessment scale-cognitive (at baseline, 90 days, 180 days). RESULTS: 48 patients (24 RIPC and 24 Control) were recruited. remote ischemic post-conditioning was well tolerated with 90 out of 96 cycles completed in full. 4 patients experienced vascular events in the control group: 3 cerebrovascular and 1 cardiovascular event versus only 2 cerebrovascular events in the RIPC group. We showed the similar result in the neurological function with national institute of health stroke scale score with no statistically significant differences between RIPC and control group at baseline (P = 0.796) and 90 days (P = 0.401) and 180 days (P = 0.695). But compare with baseline, it was significantly difference in the control and RIPC group at 90 days (P < 0.05) and 180 days (P < 0.05). The comparison of Montreal Cognitive Assessment scale between two groups both showed that P > 0.05 at baseline which was no statistical difference, but P < 0.05 at 90 days and 180 days which were significant statistical difference. The comparison of Alzheimer's disease assessment scale-cognitive between two groups showed that P > 0.05 at baseline (P = 0.955) and 90 days (P = 0.138) was no statistical difference, but P = 0.005<0.05 at 180 days was significant statistical difference. CONCLUSIONS: The remote ischemic post-conditioning for post-stroke cognitive impairment was well tolerated, safe and feasible. The remote ischemic post-conditioning may improve neurological and cognitive outcomes in patients with post-stroke cognitive impairment. A larger trial is warranted.
