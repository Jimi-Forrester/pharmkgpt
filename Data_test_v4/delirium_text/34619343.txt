However, biopsy of inner ear tissue without losing residual hearing function for pathologic diagnosis is extremely challenging. In a clinical setting, perilymph can be accessed, potentially allowing the development of fluid based diagnostic tests. Recent approaches to improving inner ear diagnostics have been focusing on the evaluation of the proteomic or miRNA profiles of perilymph. Inspired by recent characterization and classification of many neurodegenerative diseases using exosomes which not only are produced in locally in diseased tissue but are transported beyond the blood brain barrier, we demonstrate the isolation of human inner ear specific exosomes using a novel ultrasensitive immunomagnetic nano pom-poms capture-release approach. Using perilymph samples harvested from surgical procedures, we were able to isolate exosomes from sensorineural hearing loss patients in only 2-5 muL of perilymph. By isolating sensory hair cell derived exosomes through their expression level of myosin VIIa, we for the first-time sample material from hair cells in the living human inner ear. This work sets up the first demonstration of immunomagnetic capture-release nano pom-pom isolated exosomes for liquid biopsy diagnosis of sensorineural hearing loss. With the ability to isolate exosomes derived from different cell types for molecular characterization, this method also can be developed for analyzing exosomal biomarkers from more accessible patient tissue fluids such as plasma.
