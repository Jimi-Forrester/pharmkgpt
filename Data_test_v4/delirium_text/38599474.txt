38599474|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Kai-Xin-San (KXS) is a classic herbal formula for the treatment and prevention of AD (Alzheimer's disease) with definite curative effect, but its mechanism, which involves multiple components, pathways, and targets, is not yet fully understood. AIM OF THE STUDY: To verify the effect of KXS on gut microbiota and explore its anti-AD mechanism related with gut microbiota. MATERIALS AND METHODS: AD rat model was established and evaluated by intraperitoneal injection of D-gal and bilateral hippocampal CA1 injections of Abeta25-35. The pharmacodynamics of KXS in vivo includes general behavior, Morris water maze test, ELISA, Nissl & HE staining and immunofluorescence. Systematic analysis of gut microbiota was conducted using 16S rRNA gene sequencing technology. The potential role of gut microbiota in the anti-AD effect of KXS was validated with fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) experiments. RESULTS: KXS could significantly improve cognitive impairment, reduce neuronal damage and attenuate neuroinflammation and colonic inflammation in vivo in AD model rats. Nine differential intestinal bacteria associated with AD were screened, in which four bacteria (Lactobacillus murinus, Ligilactobacillus, Alloprevotella, Prevotellaceae_NK3B31_group) were very significant. CONCLUSION: KXS can maintain the ecological balance of intestinal microbiota and exert its anti-AD effect by regulating the composition and proportion of gut microbiota in AD rats through the microbiota-gut-brain axis.
