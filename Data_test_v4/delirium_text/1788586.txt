1788586|a|Psychosocial changes and physical disabilities that occur in the elderly contribute to an increase in the prevalence of psychiatric disorders in the elderly. A comprehensive approach to diagnosis is required. Depression, dementia, delirium and paranoid disorders are common psychiatric disorders seen in the elderly. Underlying treatable causes must be excluded. Treatment requires special considerations such as adverse drug reactions, drug interactions, side effects and concomitant physical illnesses. Management of the elderly should involve the family as well as the patient.
