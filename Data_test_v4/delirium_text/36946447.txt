36946447|t|The Geras Solutions Cognitive Test for Assessing Cognitive Impairment: Normative Data from a Population-Based Cohort.
36946447|a|BACKGROUND: There is a need for the development of accurate, accessible and efficient screening instruments, focused on early-stage detection of neurocognitive disorders. The Geras Solutions cognitive test (GSCT) has showed potential as a digital screening tool for cognitive impairment but normative data are needed. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to obtain normative data for the GSCT in cognitively healthy patients, investigate the effects of gender and education on test scores as well as examine test-retest reliability. METHODS: The population in this study consisted of 144 cognitively healthy subjects (MMSE>26) all at the age of 70 who were earlier included in the Healthy Aging Initiative Study conducted in Umea, Sweden. All patients conducted the GSCT and a subset of patients (n=32) completed the test twice in order to establish test-retest reliability. RESULTS: The mean GSCT score was 46.0 (+-4.5) points. High level of education (>12 years) was associated with a high GSCT score (p = 0.02) while gender was not associated with GSCT outcomes (p = 0.5). GSCT displayed a high correlation between test and retest (r(30) = 0.8, p <0.01). CONCLUSION: This study provides valuable information regarding normative test-scores on the GSCT for cognitively healthy individuals and indicates education level as the most important predictor of test outcome. Additionally, the GSCT appears to display a good test-retest reliability further strengthening the validity of the test.
