Activity is an important parameter for almost all basic and applied research areas involving laboratory animals. Locomotor activity, the main form of energy expenditure, influences metabolic rate, muscle mass, and body weight and is frequently investigated in metabolic disease research. Additionally, it serves as an indicator of animal welfare in therapeutic, pharmacological, and toxicological studies. Thus, accurate and effective measurement of activity is crucial. However, conventional monitoring systems often alter the housing environment and require handling, which can introduce artificial interference and lead to measurement inaccuracies. Methods: Our study focused on evaluating circadian activity profiles derived from the DVC and comparing them with conventional activity measurements to validate them statistically and assess their reproducibility. We utilized data from metabolic studies, an Alzheimer's disease model known for increased activity, and included DVC monitoring in a project investigating treatment effects on activity in a type-1-like diabetes model. Results: The DVC data yielded robust, scientifically accurate, and consistent circadian profiles from group-housed mice, which is particularly advantageous for longitudinal experiments. The activity profiles from both systems were fully comparable, providing matching profiles. Using DVC monitoring, we confirmed the hyperactivity phenotype in an AD model and reproduced a decline in activity in type-1-like diabetes model. Discussion: In our work, we derived robust circadian activity profiles from the DVC data of group-housed mice, which were scientifically accurate, reproducible and comparable to another activity measurement. This approach can not only improve animal welfare according to the 3R principles but can also be implement in high-throughput longitudinal studies. Furthermore, we discuss the advantages and limitations of DVC activity measurements to highlight its potential and avoid confounders.
