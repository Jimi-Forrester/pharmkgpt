35017822|a|BACKGROUND: Alcohol abuse is a public health problem and the course of alcohol dependence syndrome (ADS) is known for its relapsing nature. Additional interventions with empirical evidence are worthy of consideration. Breathing and Relaxation Training, like Sudarshan Kriya (SK) is recommended for stress management, and have been shown to positively affect outcomes in stress-related disorders. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of an intervention of Breathing and Relaxation Training, on drinking behavior in patients of ADS. METHODOLOGY: Eighty in-patients diagnosed with ADS were included after obtaining informed consent, in this prospective study and were randomized into two groups. They were administered Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT) at admission and 6-months after discharge. The Study group (n = 40) underwent a 6-day intervention of Breathing and relaxation Training (SK) apart from the standard therapy. "WHO-5 Well-Being Index" was administered before and after the training. The Control group was exposed to the standard therapy for ADS. A follow-up on a monthly basis and finally at 6-month interval was done to assess alcohol consumption status. RESULTS: Socio-demographically both the groups were comparable. The breathing and relaxation training (study) group had a significant rise in "WHO-5 Well-Being Index" (P < 0.001). There was a significant reduction in AUDIT scores after 6 months in both groups. AUDIT scores were significantly lower in the study group (11.20 +- 2.81) than the control group (15.30 +- 4.05) after 6 months (P < 0.001). The study group also reported fewer days of drinking (P = 0.004) and reduced overall drinking in the intervening period (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The addition of Breathing and Relaxation Training (SK) in the management of ADS provided additional therapeutic benefits in the form of fewer days of drinking and reduced total alcohol consumption.
