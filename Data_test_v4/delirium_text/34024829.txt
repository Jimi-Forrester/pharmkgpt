34024829|t|The Association Between Diabetes Mellitus and Mild Behavioral Impairment Among Mild Cognitive Impairment: Findings from Singapore.
34024829|a|BACKGROUND: Mild behavioral impairment (MBI) describes persistent behavioral changes in later life as an at-risk state for dementia. While cardiovascular risk factors (CVRFs) are linked to dementia, it is uncertain how CVRFs are associated with MBI. OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of MBI and its association with CVRFs among cognitively normal (CN) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) individuals in Singapore. METHODS: 172 individuals (79 CN and 93 MCI) completed the MBI-checklist (MBI-C). The prevalence of MBI and MBI-C sub-domain characteristics among CN and MCI were examined. Regression models evaluated the relationships between MBI-C sub-domain scores with CVRFs. RESULTS: The prevalence of MBI and mean MBI-C total score were significantly higher among MCI than CN (34.4%versus 20.3%, p = 0.022 and 7.01 versus 4.12, p = 0.04). The highest and lowest-rated sub-domains among CN and MCI were impulse dyscontrol and abnormal thoughts and perception respectively. Within the MCI cohort, a higher proportion of individuals with diabetes mellitus (DM) had MBI compared to individuals without DM (28.1%versus 10.4%, p = 0.025). The interaction of DM and MCI cohort resulted in significantly higher mean MBI-C total, decreased motivation, emotional dysregulation, impulse dyscontrol, and abnormal thoughts and perception sub-domain scores. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of MBI is higher among a Singapore cohort compared to Caucasian cohorts. The associations of DM with both the presence and severity of MBI among MCI suggest that DM may be a risk factor for MBI. The optimization of DM may be a potential therapeutic approach to improve clinical outcomes among MCI with MBI.
