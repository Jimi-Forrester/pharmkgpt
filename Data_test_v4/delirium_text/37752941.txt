37752941|a|Nonprogrammed cell death (NPCD) and programmed cell death (PCD) are two types of cell death. Cell death is significantly linked to tumor development, medication resistance, cancer recurrence, and metastatic dissemination. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of cell death is essential for the treatment of cancer. Pyroptosis is a kind of PCD distinct from autophagy and apoptosis in terms of the structure and function of cells. The defining features of pyroptosis include the release of an inflammatory cascade reaction and the expulsion of lysosomes, inflammatory mediators, and other cellular substances from within the cell. Additionally, it displays variations in osmotic pressure both within and outside the cell. Pyroptosis, as evidenced by a growing body of research, is critical for controlling the development of inflammatory diseases and cancer. In this paper, we reviewed the current level of knowledge on the mechanism of pyroptosis and inflammasomes and their connection to cancer and inflammatory diseases. This article presents a theoretical framework for investigating the potential of therapeutic targets in cancer and inflammatory diseases, overcoming medication resistance, establishing nanomedicines associated with pyroptosis, and developing risk prediction models in refractory cancer. Given the link between pyroptosis and the emergence of cancer and inflammatory diseases, pyroptosis-targeted treatments may be a cutting-edge treatment strategy.
