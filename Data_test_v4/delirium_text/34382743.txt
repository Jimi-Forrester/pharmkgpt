34382743|a|Heart failure (HF) with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is currently the predominant form of HF with a dramatic increase in risk with age. Low-grade inflammation, as occurs with aging (termed "inflammaging"), is a common feature of HFpEF pathology. Suppression of proinflammatory pathways has been associated with attenuated HFpEF disease severity and better outcomes. From this perspective, inflammasome signaling plays a central role in mediating chronic inflammation and cardiovascular disease progression. However, the causal link between the inflammasome-immune signaling axis on the age-dependent progression of HFpEF remains conjectural. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of the role of inflammatory pathways in age-dependent cardiac function decline. We will also evaluate recent advances and evidence regarding the inflammatory pathway in the pathophysiology of HFpEF, with special attention to inflammasome signaling.
