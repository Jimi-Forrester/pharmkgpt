24760601|a|BACKGROUND: Tako-tsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC), also known as "stress induced cardiomyopathy", is an acute cardiac condition characterized by transient myocardial dysfunction associated with a peculiar pattern of reversibile left ventricular ballooning that mimics myocardial infarction, but with normal coronary arteries. Tako-tsubo cardiomyopathy typically occurs in postmenopausal women and it is often triggered by physical or emotional stressful events. We report on a patient with Alzheimer's disease, who presented with TTC and an ischemic stroke.
