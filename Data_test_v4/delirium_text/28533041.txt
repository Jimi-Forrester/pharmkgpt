28533041|a|Alzheimer's disease or related diseases constitute a major public health issue at the heart of the 2014-2019 plan for neurodegenerative diseases. Family carers, seeing to the day-to-day care of their loved ones, require support, particularly in rural regions. A study carried out of these carers sought to understand their perception of Alzheimer's disease, their role, and in what ways their training can help to reduce their physical and mental exhaustion in order to improve their quality of life.
