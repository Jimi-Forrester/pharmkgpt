30469397|a|Four new oxysterols 1-4 along with previously known oxygenated sterols 5-14 were isolated from the sponge Inflatella sp., collected from the Sea of Okhotsk. Structures of 1-4 were elucidated by the detailed NMR spectroscopic and mass-spectrometric analyses as well as by comparison of the corresponding experimental data with those reported in literature. The influence of compounds 1-14 on the viability of neuronal Neuro2a cells treated by 6-hydroxydopamine and reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation in these cells was investigated.
