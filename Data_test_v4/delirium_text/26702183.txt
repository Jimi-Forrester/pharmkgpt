26702183|t|Systemic Lupus Erythematous Presenting as Catatonia and its Response to Electroconvulie Therapy.
26702183|a|Neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematous (SLE) encompasses various psychiatric and neurological manifestations that develop in SLE patients, secondary to involvement of central nervous system. Neuropsychiatric SLE, presenting as catatonia is very uncommon, and treatment of this condition is not well defined. Previously the role of benzodiazepines, immunosuppression, plasma exchange, and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has been described in its management. Here we describe a case of neuropsychiatric lupus presenting as catatonia that did not respond to benzodiazepines or immunosuppression. The symptoms of catatonia showed improvement with ECT. Furthermore, we have discussed the pathology of the disorder and the role of ECT in the treatment of cases of catatonia associated with SLE, who do not respond to benzodiazepines.
