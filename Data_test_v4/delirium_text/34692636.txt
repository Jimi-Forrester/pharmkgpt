34692636|a|The inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) activity prevents tau hyperphosphorylation and binds it to the microtubule network. Therefore, a GSK-3beta inhibitor may be a recommended drug for Alzheimer's treatment. In silico methods are currently considered as one of the fastest and most cost-effective available alternatives for drug/design discovery in the field of treatment. In this study, computational drug design was conducted to introduce compounds that play an effective role in inhibiting the GSK-3beta enzyme by molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation. The iridoid glycosides of the common snowberry (Symphoricarpos albus), including loganin, secologanin, and loganetin, are compounds that have an effect on improving memory and cognitive impairment and the results of which on Alzheimer's have been studied as well. In this study, in the molecular docking phase, loganin was considered a more potent inhibitor of this protein by establishing a hydrogen bond with the ATP-binding site of GSK-3beta protein and the most negative binding energy to secologanin and loganetin. Moreover, by molecular dynamics simulation of these ligands and GSK-3beta protein, all structures were found to be stable during the simulation. In addition, the protein structure represented no change and remained stable by binding ligands to GSK-3beta protein. Furthermore, loganin and loganetin have higher binding free energy than secologanin; thus, these compounds could effectively bind to the active site of GSK-3beta protein. Hence, loganin and loganetin as iridoid glycosides can be effective in Alzheimer's prevention and treatment, and thus, further in vitro and in vivo studies can focus on these iridoid glycosides as an alternative treatment.
