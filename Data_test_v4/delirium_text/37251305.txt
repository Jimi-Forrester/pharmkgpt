37251305|t|A Higher Postoperative Barthel Index at Discharge is Associated with a Lower One-Year Mortality After Hip Fracture Surgery for Geriatric Patients: A Retrospective Case-Control Study.
37251305|a|Purpose: To evaluate the relationship between the postoperative Barthel index assessing activities of daily living at discharge and the one-year mortality after hip fracture surgery. Methods: Patients with hip fracture admitted to Peking University First Hospital from January 2015 to January 2020 were enrolled retrospectively according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The Barthel index and other related confounding variables were collected. Logistic regression and Kaplan-Meier survival curves were constructed to explore the relationship between the postoperative Barthel index at discharge and the one-year mortality of geriatric patients after hip fracture surgery. Results: A total of 444 patients with a mean age of 81.61+-6.14 years were included. A significant difference was not observed in the preoperative Barthel index at admission between the deceased group and the surviving group (38.90+-15.83 vs 36.96+-10.74, p=0.446). However, the difference in the postoperative Barthel index at discharge between these two groups was statistically significant (43.08+-14.40 vs 53.18+-13.43, P<0.001). The multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that the postoperative Barthel index at discharge was an independent risk factor for one-year mortality after adjustment for confounding variables (adjusted OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.55-0.98, p 0.05). The Kaplan-Meier survival curve showed that patients who had a high Barthel index (>=50) at discharge had a significantly lower mortality in the long term than patients with a low Barthel index (<50) at discharge (P< 0.001). Conclusion: The postoperative Barthel index at discharge was independently associated with the one-year mortality of geriatric patients after hip fracture surgery. A higher postoperative Barthel index at discharge indicated a lower mortality after hip fracture surgery. The Barthel index at discharge has the potential to provide essential prognostic information for early risk stratification and directing future care.
