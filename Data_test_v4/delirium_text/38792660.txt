38792660|t|Neurotoxicity of Some Environmental Pollutants to Zebrafish.
38792660|a|The aquatic environment encompasses a wide variety of pollutants, from plastics to drug residues, pesticides, food compounds, and other food by-products, and improper disposal of waste is the main cause of the accumulation of toxic substances in water. Monitoring, assessing, and attempting to control the effects of contaminants in the aquatic environment are necessary and essential to protect the environment and thus human and animal health, and the study of aquatic ecotoxicology has become topical. In this respect, zebrafish are used as model organisms to study the bioaccumulation, toxicity, and influence of environmental pollutants due to their structural, functional, and material advantages. There are many similarities between the metabolism and physiological structures of zebrafish and humans, and the nervous system structure, blood-brain barrier function, and social behavior of zebrafish are characteristics that make them an ideal animal model for studying neurotoxicity. The aim of the study was to highlight the neurotoxicity of nanoplastics, microplastics, fipronil, deltamethrin, and rotenone and to highlight the main behavioral, histological, and oxidative status changes produced in zebrafish exposed to them.
