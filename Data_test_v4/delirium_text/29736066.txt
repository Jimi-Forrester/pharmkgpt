29736066|t|Prevalence and correlates of sexual dysfunction in male patients with alcohol dependence syndrome: A cross-sectional study.
29736066|a|BACKGROUND: Contrary to the popular belief concerning the aphrodisiac effects of alcohol, there exists scientific evidence which conclude on sexual dysfunction caused by chronic alcohol use. There is a dearth of studies from India. AIM: The aim is to estimate the prevalence and correlates of sexual dysfunction in alcohol-dependent patients and to explore the association between sexual dysfunction and various alcohol-related variables. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study employed a cross-sectional descriptive design and recruited 84 male patients admitted for de-addiction in a tertiary care center. The evaluation was conducted using a specially designed intake proforma and tools such as Severity of Alcohol Dependence Questionnaire, Arizona Sexual Experience Scale, and International Classification of Disease, 10th revision, diagnostic criteria for research. RESULTS: Thirty-seven percent of the patients had sexual dysfunction - the most common type being erectile dysfunction (25%), followed by dysfunction in satisfying orgasm (20%) and premature ejaculation (15.5%). Sexual dysfunction was significantly associated with the duration of alcohol dependence, amount of alcohol consumed per day, and severity of alcohol dependence. CONCLUSIONS: Sexual dysfunction is common in male patients with alcohol dependence. The study highlights the detrimental effects of alcohol on sexual function and this information can be utilized in motivational interviewing of patients with alcohol dependence syndrome.
