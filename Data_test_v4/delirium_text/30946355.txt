30946355|a|Vaginal pessary treatment for pelvic organ prolapse (POP) is relatively safe and cost-effective. Since long-term use is an important key to keep the benefit of pessary treatment, we would like to investigate the factors which might affect the compliance of vaginal pessaries. In this retrospective study, 65 women were included, and we found poor compliance in women with severe stress urinary incontinence (SUI) after reduction (1-hour pad test >10 gm vs  10 gm, 57.1% vs. 84.3%, P = .027). Besides, women younger than 60 years-old also had poor compliance (age  60-year-old vs >60-year-old, 58.3% vs 83.0%, P = .04). Other factors such as POP stage, history of hysterectomy, and types of pessaries, did not show significant influence on the long-term compliance in this study. Therefore, to evaluate the severity of SUI after reduction before providing pessary treatment is important to predict long-term compliance. Meanwhile, long-term pessary treatment seems to be more acceptable to elderly patients.
