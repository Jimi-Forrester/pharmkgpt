22917139|t|Clinical use of cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease.
22917139|a|The cerebrospinal fluid is a valuable diagnostic fluid that is underutilized. A number of classical neurochemical tests and newer biomarkers of neuropathology may be performed on the cerebrospinal fluid from patients with clinical signs of progressive neurological disease to assist and complement diagnosis. Here, we discuss how they may be employed in the clinical evaluation of patients with memory problems. We argue for their proper application and use, and caution against common misinterpretations.
