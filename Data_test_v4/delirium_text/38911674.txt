38911674|t|The Association of Cerebral Oxygen Desaturation with Postoperative Cognitive Dysfunction in Older Patients: A Review.
38911674|a|Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a neurological complication associated with surgery and anesthesia that is commonly observed in older patients, and it can significantly affect patient prognosis and survival. Therefore, predicting and preventing POCD is important. Regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2) reflects cerebral perfusion and oxygenation, and decreased intraoperative cerebral oxygen saturation has been reported to increase the risk of POCD. In this review, we elucidated the important relationship between the decline in rSO2 and risk of POCD in older patients. We also emphasized the importance of monitoring rSO2 during surgery to predict and prevent adverse perioperative cognitive outcomes. The findings reveal that incorporating intraoperative rSO2 monitoring into clinical practice has potential benefits, such as protecting cognitive function, reducing perioperative adverse outcomes, and ultimately improving the overall quality of life of older adults.
