We aimed to determine the prognostic value of beta-amyloid imaging, alone and in combination with memory performance, hippocampal atrophy, and apolipoprotein E epsilon4 status in nondemented, older individuals. METHODS: A total of 183 healthy individuals (age = 72.0 +- 7.26 years) and 87 participants with MCI (age = 73.7 +- 8.27) in the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers, and Lifestyle study of ageing were studied. Clinical reclassification was performed after 3 years, blind to biomarker findings. beta-Amyloid imaging was considered positive if the (11) C-Pittsburgh compound B cortical to reference ratio was >=1.5. RESULTS: Thirteen percent of healthy persons progressed (15 to MCI, 8 to dementia), and 59% of the MCI cohort progressed to probable AD. Multivariate analysis showed beta-amyloid imaging as the single variable most strongly associated with progression. Of combinations, subtle memory impairment (Z score = -0.5 to -1.5) with a positive amyloid scan was most strongly associated with progression in healthy individuals (odds ratio [OR] = 16, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.7-68; positive predictive value [PPV] = 50%, 95% CI = 19-81; negative predictive value [NPV] = 94%, 95% CI = 88-98). Almost all amnestic MCI subjects (Z score <= -1.5) with a positive amyloid scan developed AD (OR =  ; PPV = 86%, 95% CI = 72-95; NPV = 100%, 95% CI = 80-100). Hippocampal atrophy and epsilon4 status did not add further predictive value. INTERPRETATION: Subtle memory impairment with a positive beta-amyloid scan identifies healthy individuals at high risk for MCI or AD. Clearly amnestic patients with a positive amyloid scan have prodromal AD and a poor prognosis for dementia within 3 years.
