21433364|t|High Throughput Screening for Small Molecule Inhibitors of Heparin-induced Tau Fibril Formation
21433364|a|The microtubule-associated protein tau contributes directly or indirectly to key structural and regulatory cellular functions. Under pathological conditions, tau becomes sequestered into insoluble neurofibrillary tangles that promote axonal transport deficits, ultimately lead to synaptic dysfunction and neuronal loss. Beta-amyloid protein undergoes a similar type of aggregation as tau, and is implicated in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease. Recent reports describing screening of libraries of small molecules for their ability to inhibit tau fibrillization have shown that some classes of compounds, such as anthraquinones, phenothiazines, and porphyrins have the ability to inhibit tau fibril formation. While these hits may be unlikely to be developed into novel therapeutics for the treatment of tauopathies, the results suggest that in vitro assays used for these screenings are capable of detecting inhibitors of tau fibrillization. Thus, further qHTS for small molecule inhibitors of heparin-induced tau fibril formation promises to provide the identification novel and more tractable hits. HTS screening identified the probe ML103 (CID-9795907) as a member of a series of tau oligomerization/fibrillization inhibitors that can be used to study tau protein aggregation in vitro, as well as a starting point for drug development for the treatment of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and other tauopathies.
