27707312|a|Delirium, sometimes known as acute confusion, poses a major challenge in the post-operative care of many older people. For this study, 106 patients ranging in age from 65 to 93 (mean 73.9), and undergoing orthopaedic or urological surgery, were selected. Around 40 per cent of the sample subsequently developed delirium. Detailed measurements using the Mini Mental State Examination are reported.
