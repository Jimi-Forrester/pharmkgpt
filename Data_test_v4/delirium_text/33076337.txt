33076337|t|Development of Conformational Antibodies to Detect Bcl-xL's Amyloid Aggregates in Metal-Induced Apoptotic Neuroblastoma Cells.
33076337|a|Bcl-xL, a member of the Bcl-2 family, is a pro-survival protein involved in apoptosis regulation. We have previously reported the ability of Bcl-xL to form various types of fibers, from native to amyloid conformations. Here, we have mimicked the effect of apoptosis-induced caspase activity on Bcl-xL by limited proteolysis using trypsin. We show that cleaved Bcl-xL (DeltaN-Bcl-xL) forms fibers that exhibit the features of amyloid structures (BclxLcf37). Moreover, three monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), produced by mouse immunization and directed against DeltaN-Bcl-xL or Bcl-xL fibers, were selected and characterized. Our results show that these mAbs specifically target DeltaN-Bcl-xL in amyloid fibers in vitro. Upon metal-stress-induced apoptosis, these mAbs are able to detect the presence of Bcl-xL in amyloid aggregates in neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell lines. In conclusion, these specific mAbs directed against amyloidogenic conformations of Bcl-xL constitute promising tools for studying, in vitro and in cellulo, the contribution of Bcl-xL in apoptosis. These mAbs may further help in developing new diagnostics and therapies, considering Bcl-xL as a strategic target for treating brain lesions relevant to stroke and neurodegenerative diseases.
