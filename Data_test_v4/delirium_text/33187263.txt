33187263|t|RNF11 at the Crossroads of Protein Ubiquitination.
33187263|a|RNF11 (Ring Finger Protein 11) is a 154 amino-acid long protein that contains a RING-H2 domain, whose sequence has remained substantially unchanged throughout vertebrate evolution. RNF11 has drawn attention as a modulator of protein degradation by HECT E3 ligases. Indeed, the large number of substrates that are regulated by HECT ligases, such as ITCH, SMURF1/2, WWP1/2, and NEDD4, and their role in turning off the signaling by ubiquitin-mediated degradation, candidates RNF11 as the master regulator of a plethora of signaling pathways. Starting from the analysis of the primary sequence motifs and from the list of RNF11 protein partners, we summarize the evidence implicating RNF11 as an important player in modulating ubiquitin-regulated processes that are involved in transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), and Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) signaling pathways. This connection appears to be particularly significant, since RNF11 is overexpressed in several tumors, even though its role as tumor growth inhibitor or promoter is still controversial. The review highlights the different facets and peculiarities of this unconventional small RING-E3 ligase and its implication in tumorigenesis, invasion, neuroinflammation, and cancer metastasis.
