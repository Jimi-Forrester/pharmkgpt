35434652|a|Nociception is a fundamental acute protective mechanism that prevents harm to an organism. Understanding the integral processes that control nociceptive processing are fundamental to our appreciation of which cellular and molecular features underlie this process. There is an extensive understanding of how sensory neurons interpret differing sensory modalities and intensities. However, it is widely appreciated that the sensory neurons do not act alone. These work in harmony with inflammatory and vascular systems to modulate pain perception. The spinal cord has an extensive interaction with the capillary network in the form of a blood spinal cord barrier to ensure homeostatic control of the spinal cord neuron milieu. However, there is an extensive appreciation that disturbances in the blood spinal cord barrier contribute to the onset of chronic pain. Enhanced vascular permeability and impaired blood perfusion have both been highlighted as contributors to chronic pain manifestation. Here, we discuss the evidence that demonstrates alterations in the blood spinal cord barrier influences nociceptive processing and perception of pain.
