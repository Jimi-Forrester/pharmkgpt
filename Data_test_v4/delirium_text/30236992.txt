30236992|t|Human beta-defensin 1 update: Potential clinical applications of the restless warrior.
30236992|a|Human beta-defensin 1 (hBD-1) is a multifaceted antimicrobial peptide being a tumour suppressor and, depending on call of duty, capable of inducing self-nets and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) to capture and/or kill bacteria, participates in inflammatory responses in chronic diseases including hBD-3 upregulation and also capable of up/downregulation in the presence of certain species of Lactobacillus sp. Thus, is regulated by host microbiota. Alleles, genotypes and/or altered gene expression of its coding gene, DEFB1, have been associated with several human diseases/conditions ranging from metabolic/chronic (e.g. cancer), infectious (e.g. tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS), inflammatory (gastrointestinal diseases), male infertility and more recently, neurologic (e.g. depression and Alzheimer) and autoimmune diseases (e.g. vitiligo and systemic lupus erythematosus). The present update focuses on novel DEFB1/hBD-1 properties and biomarker features, its biological function and the pharmaceutical potential uses of antimicrobial peptide elicitors (APEs) or the engineered peptide in the treatment of hBD-1-related human diseases.
