36235284|t|Conformational Essentials Responsible for Neurotoxicity of Abeta42 Aggregates Revealed by Antibodies against Oligomeric Abeta42.
36235284|a|Soluble aggregation of amyloid beta-peptide 1-42 (Abeta42) and deposition of Abeta42 aggregates are the initial pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The bipolar nature of Abeta42 molecule results in its ability to assemble into distinct oligomers and higher aggregates, which may drive some of the phenotypic heterogeneity observed in AD. Agents targeting Abeta42 or its aggregates, such as anti-Abeta42 antibodies, can inhibit the aggregation of Abeta42 and toxicity of Abeta42 aggregates to neural cells to a certain extent. However, the epitope specificity of an antibody affects its binding affinity for different Abeta42 species. Different antibodies target different sites on Abeta42 and thus elicit different neuroprotective or cytoprotective effects. In the present review, we summarize significant information reflected by anti-Abeta42 antibodies in different immunotherapies and propose an overview of the structure (conformation)-toxicity relationship of Abeta42 aggregates. This review aimed to provide a reference for the directional design of antibodies against the most pathogenic conformation of Abeta42 aggregates.
