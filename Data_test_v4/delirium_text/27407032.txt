27407032|t|Design, synthesis, and evaluation of Trolox-conjugated amyloid-beta C-terminal peptides for therapeutic intervention in an in vitro model of Alzheimer's disease.
27407032|a|Two hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) observed in the brains of patients with the disease include oxidative injury and deposition of protein aggregates comprised of amyloid-beta (Abeta) variants. To inhibit these toxic processes, we synthesized antioxidant-conjugated peptides comprised of Trolox and various C-terminal motifs of Abeta variants, TxAbetax-n (x=34, 36, 38, 40; n=40, 42, 43). Most of these compounds were found to exhibit anti-aggregation activities. Among them, TxAbeta36-42 significantly inhibited Abeta1-42 aggregation, showed potent antioxidant activity, and protected SH-SY5Y cells from Abeta1-42-induced cytotoxicity. Thus, this method represents a promising strategy for developing multifunctional AD therapeutic agents.
