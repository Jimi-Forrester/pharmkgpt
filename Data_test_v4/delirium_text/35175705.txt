35175705|a|OBJECTIVE: To compare the structure of cognitive deficit in patients with glaucoma, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VD). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Ninety patients were comprehensively examined and divided into 3 groups of 30 people each: AD group, VD group and open-angle glaucoma group. All patients underwent neurological and neuropsychological examination. RESULTS: The data on the similarity of the structure of cognitive deficit in patients with AD and glaucoma were obtained. More than half of patients with open-angle glaucoma were newly diagnosed with moderate cognitive impairment. CONCLUSION: The results indicate the need for a comprehensive neurological and neuropsychological examination of patients with glaucoma for the early diagnosis of cognitive disorders, timely therapy and an improvement in the prognosis of the disease.
