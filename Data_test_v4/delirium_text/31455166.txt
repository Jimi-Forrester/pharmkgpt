31455166|a|PURPOSE: Information on the short- and long-term outcomes of induction chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery for cT3-4 non-small cell lung cancer is limited. We analyzed the short- and long-term outcomes of induction chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery for cT3-4 non-small cell lung cancer. METHODS: Patients with non-small cell lung cancer who underwent induction chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery for cT3-4 non-small cell lung cancer were retrospectively reviewed (initial treatment group, n = 31). Their results were compared to those patients who underwent surgery as an initial treatment during the same period (initial surgery group, n = 35). RESULTS: Downstaging was achieved in 14 (45%) patients in the initial treatment group. R0 resection was achieved in 28 (90%) patients in the initial treatment group and 31 (88%) patients in the initial surgery group. The 90-day mortality rate was 3% in each group. Postoperative complications occurred in 16 (52%) patients in the initial treatment group and 13 (37%) patients in the initial surgery group. The 5-year overall survival rate of the initial treatment group was significantly higher than that of the initial surgery group (62.6% vs 43.5%, P = .04). The 5-year overall survival rates of the initial treatment N0-1 group and the initial surgery N0-1 group were 88.9% and 49.3%, respectively; the difference was statistically significant (P = .02). Multivariate analysis using 4 factors (age [<=65 vs >65], cN [cN0-1 vs cN2], general condition [chemoradiotherapy fit vs chemoradiotherapy unfit], and treatment mode [induction chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery vs surgery as an initial treatment]) revealed that treatment mode (induction chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery) and cN status (cN0-1) were significantly associated with good overall survival and disease-free survival. CONCLUSIONS: Induction chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery for cT3-4 non-small cell lung cancer could be performed with an acceptable degree of surgical risk. At present, it is thought to be one of the reasonable treatment approaches for selected patients with cT3-4 disease, even those with a cN0-1 status.
