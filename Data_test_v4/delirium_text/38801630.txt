38801630|a|The pathophysiological regulatory mechanisms in postoperative neurocognitive disorders (PNCDs) are intricately complex. Currently, the pathogenesis of PNCDs has not been fully elucidated. The mechanism involved may include a variety of factors, such as neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and neuroendocrine dysregulation. Research into the gut microbiota-induced regulations on brain functions is increasingly becoming a focal point of exploration. Emerging evidence has shown that intestinal bacteria may play an essential role in maintaining the homeostasis of various physiological systems and regulating disease occurrence. Recent studies have confirmed the association of the gut-brain axis with central nervous system diseases. However, the regulatory effects of this axis in the pathogenesis of PNCDs remain unclear. Therefore, this paper intends to review the bidirectional signaling and mechanism of the gut-brain axis in PNCDs, summarize the latest research progress, and discuss the possible mechanism of intestinal bacteria affecting nervous system diseases. This review is aimed at providing a scientific reference for predicting the clinical risk of PNCD patients and identifying early diagnostic markers and prevention targets.
