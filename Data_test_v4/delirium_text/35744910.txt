35744910|a|Crocodile oil (CO) is generated from the fatty tissues of crocodiles as a by-product of commercial aquaculture. CO is extensively applied in the treatment of illnesses including asthma, emphysema, skin ulcers, and cancer, as well as wound healing. Whether CO has anti-inflammatory properties and encourages an immune response remains uncertain. The impact of CO on inflammatory conditions in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells and the mechanisms behind it were examined in this work. Cells were treated with 0.125-2% CO dissolved in 0.5% propylene glycol with or without LPS. The production and expression of inflammatory cytokines and mediators were also examined in this research. CO reduced the synthesis and gene expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6). Consistently, CO inhibited the expression and synthesis of inflammatory markers including cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), nitric oxide (NO), and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB). Furthermore, CO reduced the effects of DNA damage. CO also increased the cell-cycle regulators, cyclins D2 and E2, which improved the immunological response. CO might thus be produced as a nutraceutical supplement to help avoid inflammatory diseases.
