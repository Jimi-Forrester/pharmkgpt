38529958|t|A Nurse Practitioner-Driven Palliative and Supportive Care Service in Nursing Homes: Evaluation of a Quality Improvement Project.
38529958|a|This article describes a quality improvement project implemented by a national postacute long-term care organization aimed at enhancing the provision of palliative care to nursing home residents. The project focused on improving advance care planning, end-of-life care, symptom management, and care of people living with serious illness. Both generalist and specialist palliative care training were provided to nurse practitioners in addition to implementing a system to identify residents most likely to benefit from a palliative approach to care. To evaluate the nurse practitioner experiences of the program, survey data were collected from nurse practitioners (N = 7) involved in the project at 5 months after implementation. Nurse practitioners reported the program was well received by nursing home staff, families, and residents. Most nurse practitioners felt more confident managing residents' symptoms and complex care needs; however, some reported needing additional resources for palliative care delivery. Most common symptoms that were managed included pain, delirium, and dyspnea; most common diagnoses cared for were dementia and chronic organ failure (eg, cardiac, lung, renal, and neurological diseases). In the next steps, the project will be expanded throughout the organization, and person- and family-centered outcomes will be evaluated.
