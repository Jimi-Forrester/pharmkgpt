38917863|a|The care of a patient with neurologic disease at end-of-life requires expertise in addressing advance care planning, hospice, symptom management, and caregiver support. Neurologists caring for patients with advanced neurologic disease often identify changes in disease trajectory, functional status, or goals of care that prompt discussions of advance care planning and hospice. Patients nearing end-of-life may develop symptoms such as dyspnea, secretions, delirium, pain, and seizures. Neurologists may be the primary clinicians managing these symptoms, particularly in the hospitalized patient, though they may also lend their expertise to non-neurologists about expected disease trajectories and symptoms in advanced neurologic disease. This article aims to help neurologists guide patients and caregivers through the end-of-life process by focusing on general knowledge that can be applied across diseases as well as specific considerations in severe stroke and traumatic brain injury, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, and dementia.
