35008886|t|Relevance of a Novel Circuit-Level Model of Episodic Memories to Alzheimer's Disease.
35008886|a|The medial temporal lobe memory system has long been identified as the brain region showing the first histopathological changes in early Alzheimer's disease (AD), and the functional decline observed in patients also points to a loss of function in this brain area. Nonetheless, the exact identity of the neurons and networks that undergo deterioration has not been determined so far. A recent study has identified the entorhinal and hippocampal neural circuits responsible for encoding new episodic memories. Using this novel model we describe the elements of the episodic memory network that are especially vulnerable in early AD. We provide a hypothesis of how reduced reelin signaling within such a network can promote AD-related changes. Establishing novel associations and creating a temporal structure for new episodic memories are both affected in AD. Here, we furnish a reasonable explanation for both of these previous observations.
