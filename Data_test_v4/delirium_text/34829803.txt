34829803|t|Sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) Pathways in Age-Related Cardiovascular and Neurodegenerative Diseases.
34829803|a|Age-associated cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases lead to high morbidity and mortality around the world. Sirtuins are vital enzymes for metabolic adaptation and provide protective effects against a wide spectrum of pathologies. Among sirtuins, mitochondrial sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) is an essential player in preserving the habitual metabolic profile. SIRT3 activity declines as a result of aging-induced changes in cellular metabolism, leading to increased susceptibility to endothelial dysfunction, hypertension, heart failure and neurodegenerative diseases. Stimulating SIRT3 activity via lifestyle, pharmacological or genetic interventions could protect against a plethora of pathologies and could improve health and lifespan. Thus, understanding how SIRT3 operates and how its protective effects could be amplified, will aid in treating age-associated diseases and ultimately, in enhancing the quality of life in elders.
