38479065|a|PROBLEM: Emergence delirium (ED) in children post-general anesthesia has been persistently underestimated, impacting the well-being of children, nurses, and even parents. This study employs integrated analysis to establish a comprehensive understanding of ED, including its occurrence and related risk factors, emphasizing the imperative for enhanced awareness and comprehension among pediatric nursing care providers. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted using four electronic databases, namely PubMed, CINAHL via EBSCOhost, Embase via Elsevier, and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses. RESULTS: This meta-analysis included 16 studies involving 9598 children who underwent general anesthesia. The pooled prevalence of ED was 19.2% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.12 to 0.29), with younger patients exhibiting a higher prevalence of ED. ED research is scant in Africa and is mostly limited to the Asia Pacific region and Northern Europe. Neck and head surgery (odds ratio [OR] = 2.34, 95% CI = 1.29 to 4.27) were significantly associated with ED risk. CONCLUSIONS: ED should be monitored in children who receive general anesthesia. In this study, ED had a prevalence rate of 19.2%, and head and neck surgery were significantly associated with ED risk. Therefore, healthcare professionals should carefully manage and prevent ED in children undergoing general anesthesia. IMPLICATIONS: A comprehensive understanding of ED's prevalence and risk factors is crucial for enhancing nursing care. Adopting a family-centered care approach can empower parents with information to collaboratively care for their children, promoting a holistic approach to pediatric healthcare.
