31701045|a|BACKGROUND: Heavy alcohol use is prevalent among men who have sex with men (MSM) living with HIV and is associated with reduced antiretroviral therapy adherence, reduced HIV viral suppression, and reduced survival. We recently found that compared to HIV treatment as usual, three sessions of in-person motivational interviewing (MI) substantially reduced drinking in MSM with HIV. In an effort to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of this intervention, the present study will test whether MI is more effective than brief intervention when delivered by videoconferencing, whether interactive text messaging (ITM) can enhance the effects of alcohol intervention, and whether extended duration of intervention is more effective than brief duration. METHODS: Using a 2 x 2 x 2 factorial design, we will randomly assign 224 heavy-drinking MSM with HIV to: MI or brief intervention (BI); ITM or no ITM; Standard or Extended intervention (EI). All participants will receive intervention immediately after baseline assessment via videoconferencing and at 1-month post baseline via telephone. Participants randomized to EI will receive additional intervention sessions at 3, 6, and 9 months. Participants randomized to ITM will receive daily interactive texts about alcohol use for 1 month, with those randomized to EI receiving weekly interactive texts through 9 months. Alcohol and HIV-related outcomes will be assessed at 6 and 12 months post baseline. CONCLUSION: By testing the combinations of interventions that can most effectively reduce alcohol use among MSM with HIV, this study will set the stage for wider-scale implementation of an optimized intervention combination.
