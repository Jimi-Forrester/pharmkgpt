36029407|a|Mitochondrial function is essential to ensure vital cellular processes. Given the energy requirement of the brain, neuronal function, viability, and survival are closely related to proper mitochondrial function. Dysregulation of mitochondrial processes can lead to several detrimental effects in the cells and stablish the condition of mitochondrial dysfunction. This dysfunction is proposed to be greatly implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases, with evidence of compromised mitochondrial function and dynamics in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
