30303972|t|Brain gray and white matter abnormalities in preterm-born adolescents: A meta-analysis of voxel-based morphometry studies.
30303972|a|INTRODUCTION: Studies using voxel-based morphometry report variable and inconsistent abnormalities of gray matter volume (GMV) and white matter volume (WMV) in brains of preterm-born adolescents (PBA). In such circumstances a meta-analysis can help identify the most prominent and consistent abnormalities. METHOD: We identified 9 eligible studies by systematic search of the literature up to October 2017. We used Seed-based d Mapping to analyze GMV and WMV alterations between PBA and healthy controls. RESULTS: In the GMV meta-analysis, PBA compared to healthy controls showed: increased GMV in left cuneus cortex, left superior frontal gyrus, and right anterior cingulate cortex; decreased GMV in bilateral inferior temporal gyrus (ITG), left superior frontal gyrus, and right caudate nucleus. In the WMV meta-analysis, PBA showed: increased WMV in right fusiform gyrus and precuneus; decreased WMV in bilateral ITG, and right inferior frontal gyrus. In meta-regression analysis, the percentage of male PBA negatively correlated with decreased GMV of bilateral ITG. INTERPRETATION: PBA show widespread GMV and WMV alterations in the default mode network, visual recognition network, and salience network. These changes may be causally relevant to socialization difficulties and cognitive impairments. The meta-regression results perhaps reveal the structural underpinning of the cognition-related sex differences in PBA.
