35268851|t|Sulforaphane and Its Bifunctional Analogs: Synthesis and Biological Activity.
35268851|a|For decades, various plants have been studied as sources of biologically active compounds. Compounds with anticancer and antimicrobial properties are the most frequently desired. Cruciferous plants, including Brussels sprouts, broccoli, and wasabi, have a special role in the research studies. Studies have shown that consumption of these plants reduce the risk of lung, breast, and prostate cancers. The high chemopreventive and anticancer potential of cruciferous plants results from the presence of a large amount of glucosinolates, which, under the influence of myrosinase, undergo an enzymatic transformation to biologically active isothiocyanates (ITCs). Natural isothiocyanates, such as benzyl isothiocyanate, phenethyl isothiocyanate, or the best-tested sulforaphane, possess anticancer activity at all stages of the carcinogenesis process, show antibacterial activity, and are used in organic synthesis. Methods of synthesis of sulforaphane, as well as its natural or synthetic bifunctional analogues with sulfinyl, sulfanyl, sulfonyl, phosphonate, phosphinate, phosphine oxide, carbonyl, ester, carboxamide, ether, or additional isothiocyanate functional groups, and with the unbranched alkyl chain containing 2-6 carbon atoms, are discussed in this review. The biological activity of these compounds are also reported. In the first section, glucosinolates, isothiocyanates, and mercapturic acids (their metabolites) are briefly characterized. Additionally, the most studied anticancer and antibacterial mechanisms of ITC actions are discussed.
