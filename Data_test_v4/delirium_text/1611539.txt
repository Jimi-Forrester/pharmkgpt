1611539|t|The autoinhibitory feedback control of acetylcholine release in human neocortex tissue.
1611539|a|Slices of human neocortex prelabelled with [3H]choline were superfused and stimulated electrically (3 Hz, 2 ms, 24 mA) in order to investigate the autoreceptor-mediated modulation of acetylcholine (ACh) release. The concentration-response curve of the muscarinic agonist oxotremorine (pKd = 6.76 +/- 0.06), which was equipotent to ACh, was shifted to the right in a parallel manner by atropine (pA2 = 8.56 +/- 0.11), as evaluated by non-linear regression analysis. Calculation of the biophase concentration of ACh showed that no ACh could be assumed to be present under these conditions, whereas following inhibition of the acetylcholinesterase by physostigmine (0.1 microM) a biophase concentration of 10(-6.89 +/- 0.11) M was estimated. The depression of ACh release due to physostigmine and tacrine, another anticholinesterase, was antagonized by atropine. When the autoinhibition was operative atropine and the M2 subtype specific muscarinic antagonists, AF-DX 116 and methoctramine, significantly increased the release of ACh whereas the 'facilitatory' effects of the M1 and M3-specific drugs, pirenzepine and hexahydrosiladifenidol, were not significant. Although different disinhibitory effects of the subtype-specific antagonists were found, they did, however, not show a pattern which would allow a clear characterisation of the subtype of muscarinic receptor associated with the autoreceptor. The release of ACh from neocortex tissue of the (non-demented) neurosurgical patients decreased with their age. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that the normal aging process resembles a delayed and attenuated disease process of senile dementia of Alzheimer's type.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
