36042422|a|BACKGROUND: Several methods are used for hearing loss screening; however, their benefits are uncertain. In this study, we aimed to determine the predictive factors of acute sensorineural hearing loss for clinical application by primary care doctors. METHODS: This retrospective, cross-sectional study included 365 patients with acute sensorineural hearing loss without prior therapy. The patients' clinical data, demographic information, and medical histories were obtained, and they were asked about comorbidities. In addition, we assessed lifestyle factors such as stress level, alcohol consumption, marital status, and socioeconomic level. Logistic regression analysis was performed to investigate the diagnostic predictive ability of the selected factors associated with acute sensorineural hearing loss. The hearing levels of all patients were evaluated using pure tone audiometry. RESULTS: We identified significant predictive factors for acute sensorineural hearing loss. The absence of hyperacusis was a predictive factor for sudden sensorineural hearing loss. Younger age, female sex, and marital status were predictive factors for acute low-tone hearing loss. High body mass index, high socioeconomic level, low alcohol consumption, high stress level, hyperacusis, and vertigo/dizziness were predictive factors for Meniere's disease. High body mass index and ear fullness were predictive factors for perilymph fistula. Low stress level was a predictive factor for acoustic tumours. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings can be used to distinguish between the types of acute sensorineural hearing loss. Symptoms, physical status, and lifestyle factors identified during this study are useful markers for predicting acute sensorineural hearing loss occurrence.
