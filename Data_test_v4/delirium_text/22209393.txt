22209393|t|Perceptual and motor inhibitory abilities in normal aging and Alzheimer disease (AD): a preliminary study.
22209393|a|Deficits in inhibitory abilities are frequently observed in normal aging and AD. However, few studies have explored the generality of these deficits in a single group of participants. A battery of tasks assessing perceptual and motor inhibitory functioning was administered to young and older healthy participants (Study 1), as well as to mild Alzheimer patients (Study 2). Results did not agree with a selective impairment of motor or perceptual inhibition in either AD or normal aging but rather suggest that a decrease in cognitive resources available in working memory could explain inhibitory performance both in normal aging and AD.
