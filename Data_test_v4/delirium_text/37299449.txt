37299449|t|Association between Dietary Hardness and Cognitive Dysfunction among Japanese Men in Their 60s: A Cross-Sectional Study.
37299449|a|We aimed to examine the cross-sectional association between dietary hardness and cognitive dysfunction among Japanese men in their 60s. Participants were 1494 men aged 60-69 years from the baseline survey of Hitachi Health Study II (2017-2020). Dietary hardness was defined as an estimate of masticatory muscle activity involved in consuming solid foods. Habitual intake of these foods was assessed using a brief-type, self-administered diet history questionnaire. Cognitive dysfunction was defined as a score <= 13 points on the test battery for screening for Alzheimer's disease (MSP-1100). The mean (SD) age of participants was 63.5 (3.5) years. The prevalence of cognitive dysfunction was 7.5%. The ORs (95% CIs) for cognitive dysfunction in the second and third tertiles were: 0.77 (0.47, 1.26) and 0.87 (0.54, 1.41), respectively, after adjustment for socio-demographic factors (p for trend = 0.73). After further adjustment for protective nutrient intake against cognitive dysfunction, the corresponding figures were 0.72 (0.43, 1.21) and 0.79 (0.43, 1.46), respectively (p for trend = 0.57). Dietary hardness was not associated with the prevalence of cognitive dysfunction among Japanese men in their 60s. Future prospective studies are necessary to investigate the association between dietary hardness estimated by a validated questionnaire and cognitive dysfunctions.
