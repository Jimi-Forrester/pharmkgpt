39229261|t|IL6 receptor inhibitors: exploring the therapeutic potential across multiple diseases through drug target Mendelian randomization.
39229261|a|Background: High interleukin-6 levels correlate with diseases like cancer, autoimmune disorders, and infections. IL-6 receptor inhibitors (IL-6Ri), used for rheumatoid arthritis and COVID-19, may have wider uses. We apply drug-target Mendelian Randomization (MR) to study IL-6Ri's effects. Method: To simulate the effects of genetically blocking the IL-6R, we selected single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within or near the IL6R gene that show significant genome-wide associations with C-reactive protein. Using rheumatoid arthritis and COVID-19 as positive controls, our primary research outcomes included the risk of asthma, asthmatic pneumonia, cor pulmonale, non-small cell lung cancer, small cell lung cancer, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, type 1 diabetes, and type 2 diabetes. The Inverse Variance Weighted (IVW) method served as our principal analytical approach, with the hypotheses of MR being evaluated through sensitivity and colocalization analyses. Additionally, we conducted Bayesian Mendelian Randomization analyses to minimize confounding and reverse causation biases to the greatest extent possible. Results: IL-6 inhibitors significantly reduced the risk of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (OR= 0.278, 95% [CI], 0.138-0.558; P <0.001), Parkinson's disease (OR = 0.354, 95% CI, 0.215-0.582; P <0.001), and positively influenced the causal relationship with Type 2 diabetes (OR = 0.759, 95% CI, 0.637-0.905; P = 0.002). However, these inhibitors increased the risk for asthma (OR = 1.327, 95% CI, 1.118-1.576; P = 0.001) and asthmatic pneumonia (OR = 1.823, 95% CI, 1.246-2.666; P = 0.002). The causal effect estimates obtained via the BWMR method are consistent with those based on the IVW approach. Similarly, sIL-6R also exerts a significant influence on these diseases.Diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Crohn's disease, pulmonary heart disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, Type 1 diabetes, Non-small cell lung cancer and ulcerative colitis showed non-significant associations (p > 0.05) and were excluded from further analysis. Similarly, Small cell lung cancer were excluded due to inconsistent results. Notably, the colocalization evidence for asthmatic pneumonia (coloc.abf-PPH4 = 0.811) robustly supports its association with CRP. The colocalization evidence for Parkinson's disease (coloc.abf-PPH4 = 0.725) moderately supports its association with CRP. Conclusion: IL-6Ri may represent a promising therapeutic avenue for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, Parkinson's disease, and Type 2 diabetes.
