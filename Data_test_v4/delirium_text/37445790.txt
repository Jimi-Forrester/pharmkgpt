37445790|t|A State-of-Art Review of the Vicious Circle of Sleep Disorders, Diabetes and Neurodegeneration Involving Metabolism and Microbiota Alterations.
37445790|a|In the context of neurodegenerative disorders, cognitive decline is frequently reported in older population. Recently, numerous metabolic pathways have been implicated in neurodegeneration, including signaling disruption of insulin and other glucose-regulating hormones. In fact, Alzheimer's disease has now been considered as "type-3 diabetes". In this review, we tried to clarify the role of sleep impairment as the third major player in the complex relationship between metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases. Altered sleep may trigger or perpetuate these vicious mechanisms, leading to the development of both dementia and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Finally, we analyzed these reciprocal interactions considering the emerging role of the gut microbiota in modulating the same processes. Conditions of dysbiosis have been linked to circadian rhythm disruption, metabolic alterations, and release of neurotoxic products, all contributing to neurodegeneration. In a future prospective, gut microbiota could provide a major contribution in explaining the tangled relationship between sleep disorders, dementia and diabetes.
