17717413|a|AIMS: To investigate the relationship between verbal memory performance and brain metabolism as determined by proton spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) in selected cortical brain regions. To characterize metabolite abnormalities across the continuum of degenerative disease from mild impairment to dementia. METHODS: 27 controls, 27 amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) patients and 35 Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Verbal memory was assessed with the Text Memory Test, the Wordlist Learning Test (WL-Learning Test), and with a memory screening test, the Memory Alteration Test (M@T). Single-voxel (1)H-MRS was obtained in the posterior cingulate (P-CING), left temporal pole (L-TPOLE) and left posterior temporoparietal region (L-TPAR). RESULTS: WL-Learning Test scores were inversely associated with myoinositol/creatine ratios (mI/Cr) in the L-TPAR (r = -0.404, p < 0.002). Negative associations were also observed between M@T global scores and mI/Cr in the P-CING (r = -0.42; p < 0.001), L-TPOLE (r = -0.34; p < 0.005) and L-TPAR (r = -0.46; p < 0.001). A positive association was found between M@T scores and N-acetylaspartate concentrations in the P-CING (r = 0.33; p < 0.003). CONCLUSION: Verbal learning performance is related to metabolic changes in cortical brain regions known to be involved in the neurodegenerative process of aMCI and AD.
