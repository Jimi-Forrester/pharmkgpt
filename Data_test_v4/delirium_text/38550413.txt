38550413|t|Cognitive Impairment in a 64-Year-Old Male: Dilemmas With Differential Diagnosis for Patients With Dementia.
38550413|a|Dementia is characterized by cognitive impairment and difficulties in executive functioning. It is an umbrella term for different subtypes that should be differentiated using a meticulous review of the patient's history, physical exam, and work-up. Posing difficulties in diagnosis, findings at times may be inconclusive. We report a case of a depressed patient on hemodialysis for end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who presents with an acute agitated episode following a visual hallucination that he has been experiencing intermittently for six months, along with a three- to four-year history of cognitive impairments. Our differential diagnosis includes vascular dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies, pseudodementia, dialysis dementia, and early-onset Alzheimer's. In this case, the findings of a normal mini-mental status exam (MMSE) and mental status exam (MSE) do not correlate with a working diagnosis. Due to persistent dilemmas in diagnosing early neurocognitive impairment, continued monitoring and re-assessment are necessitated for efficient management of psychiatric patients with cognitive decline.
