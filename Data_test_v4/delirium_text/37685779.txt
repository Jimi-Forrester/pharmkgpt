37685779|t|The Impact of Diffuse Idiopathic Skeletal Hyperostosis on Nutritional Status, Neurological Outcome, and Perioperative Complications in Patients with Cervical Spinal Cord Injury.
37685779|a|This retrospective study aimed to investigate the characteristics of patients with cervical spinal cord injuries (CSCI) with diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH). We included 153 consecutive patients with CSCI who underwent posterior decompression and fusion surgery. The patients were divided into two groups based on the presence of DISH. Patient characteristics, neurological status on admission, nutritional status, perioperative laboratory variables, complications, neurological outcomes at discharge, and medical costs were compared between the groups. The DISH group (n = 24) had significantly older patients (72.1 vs. 65.9, p = 0.036), more patients with low-impact trauma (62.5% vs. 34.1%, p = 0.009), and a lower preoperative prognostic nutritional index on admission (39.8 vs. 42.5, p = 0.014) than the non-DISH group (n =129). Patients with DISH had significantly higher rates of ventilator management (16.7% vs. 3.1%, p = 0.022) and pneumonia (29.2% vs. 8.5%, p = 0.010). There was no significant difference in medical costs and neurological outcomes on discharge. Patients with CSCI and DISH were older, had poor nutritional status, and were prone to postoperative respiratory complications, while no differences were found between the neurological outcomes of patients with CSCI with and without DISH.
