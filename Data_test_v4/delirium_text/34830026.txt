34830026|a|Melatonin is a highly conserved molecule found in prokaryotes and eukaryotes that acts as the darkness hormone, translating environmental lighting to the whole body, and as a moderator of innate and acquired defense, migration, and cell proliferation processes. This review evaluates the importance of pineal activity in monitoring PAMPs and DAMPs and in mounting an inflammatory response or innate immune response. Activation of the immune-pineal axis, which coordinates the pro-and anti-inflammatory phases of an innate immune response, is described. PAMPs and DAMPs promote the immediate suppression of melatonin production by the pineal gland, which allows leukocyte migration. Monocyte-derived macrophages, important phagocytes of microbes, and cellular debris produce melatonin locally and thereby initiate the anti-inflammatory phase of the acute inflammatory response. The role of locally produced melatonin in organs that directly contact the external environment, such as the skin and the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts, is also discussed. In this context, as resident macrophages are self-renewing cells, we explore evidence indicating that, besides avoiding overreaction of the immune system, extra-pineal melatonin has a fundamental role in the homeostasis of organs and tissues.
