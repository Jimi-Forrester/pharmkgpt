36727123|t|Primary and subsequent secondary aorto-enteric fistulae in the setting of chronic Q fever.
36727123|a|We report the case of an 80-year-old male with stage three kidney disease, who survived a primary aorto-enteric fistula (AEF) in the setting of chronic Q fever after presenting with melena and syncope. His initial surgical treatment included endovascular aortic repair. Type 2 endoleak was present post-operatively. Six months later, he was diagnosed with a secondary AEF after syncope and large volume hematemesis. He was definitively treated with an open explant of his stent, repair of the duodenum and bilateral axillofemoral bypass. Two years later, he remains active and independent on life-long antibiotics.
