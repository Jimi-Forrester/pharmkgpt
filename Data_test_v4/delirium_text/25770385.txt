25770385|a|BACKGROUND: Vascular surgery patients are frequently deemed to be in a frail clinical condition and at risk for delirium. Therefore, we evaluated the incidence and independent perioperative risk factors for delirium. In addition, we describe factors on frailty in the various vascular disease groups in current practice. METHODS: This observational longitudinal study included 206 selected patients who were referred to a vascular surgery ward of a large-sized teaching hospital (Amphia Hospital, Breda, The Netherlands) for critical limb ischemia (n = 80), diabetic foot ulcers (n = 27), abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) (n = 62), and carotid surgery (n = 37) between April 2013 and December 2013. Data on factors that characterize frailty were collected. Delirium was scored using the Delirium Observation Screening Scale. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to find independent risk factors for delirium. RESULTS: Delirium was present in 24% of the critical limb ischemia patients, in 19% of the patients with a diabetic foot ulcer, in 7% of the patients with an AAA, and in 8% of the patients undergoing carotid surgery (P > 0.05). Of the patients with critical limb ischemia and a delirium, 53% were octogenarians. Multivariable stepwise logistic regression analysis revealed that history of delirium and nurse help at patient's home were independently associated with delirium. Patients with critical limb ischemia scored worse on factors related to frailty compared with the other disease groups in our current clinical practice on vascular surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Delirium is a frequent complication in vascular surgery clinical practice, especially in the elderly. Nurse visits at patients' homes and the Amphia Risk Score for delirium were independent risk factors for delirium in our study population. In this study, we identified patients with critical limb ischemia as the most frail and vulnerable.
