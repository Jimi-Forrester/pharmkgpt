28799782|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia in the elderly and is a chronic neurodegenerative disease that is becoming widespread. For this reason, in recent years factors affecting the development, progression and cognitive function of the AD have been emphasized. Nutrients and other bioactive nutrients are among the factors that are effective in AD. In particular, vitamins A, C and E, vitamins B1, B6 and B12, folate, magnesium, choline, inositol, anthocyanins, isoflavones etc. nutrients and bioactive nutrients are known to be effective in the development of AD. Nutrients and nutrient components may also have an epigenetic effect on AD. At the same time, nutrients and bioactive food components slow down the progression of the disease. For this reason, the effect of nutrients and food components on AD was examined in this review.
