700928|t|Digitalis delirium: psychiatric considerations.
700928|a|Digitalis is a ubiquitous drug in modern clinical medicine and digitoxicity is one of the more common iatrogenic disorders. Psychiatric problems are often overlooked as manifestations of digitalis excess and may range from mild disorientation, lethargy, or restlessness to full blown delirium. In this paper we discuss two patients who presented to a psychiatric inpatient unit and were later found to be digitoxic. Psychiatrists are advised to consider digitalis as a possible cause of mental abnormalities and are reminded that psychiatric signs may be the first indication of a potentially lethal drug toxicity. Psychiatric patients may also be at special risk for the development of digitoxicity because of erratic drug taking, electrolyte imbalance or increased autonomic tone.
