38610709|t|Alterations in Gut Microbiota and Their Correlation with Brain Beta-Amyloid Burden Measured by 18F-Florbetaben PET in Mild Cognitive Impairment Due to Alzheimer's Disease.
38610709|a|(1) Background: This study investigated changes in the gut microbial composition of individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) and their relationship with positron emission tomography (PET) amyloid accumulation. (2) Methods: In total, 17 cognitively normal individuals without amyloid-beta (Abeta) accumulation (Abeta-NC) and 24 with Abeta-positive mild cognitive impairment (Abeta+MCI) who underwent 18F-florbetaben PET and fecal bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing were enrolled. The taxonomic compositions of the Abeta-NC and Abeta+MCI groups were compared. The abundance of taxa was correlated with the standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR), using generalized linear models. (3) Results: There were significant differences in microbiome richness (ACE, p = 0.034 and Chao1, p = 0.024), alpha diversity (Shannon, p = 0.039), and beta diversity (Bray-Curtis, p = 0.018 and Generalized UniFrac, p = 0.034) between the Abeta-NC and Abeta+MCI groups. The global SUVR was positively correlated with the genus Intestinibacter (q = 0.006) and negatively correlated with the genera Roseburia (q = 0.008) and Agathobaculum (q = 0.029). (4) Conclusions: In this study, we identified significant changes in the gut microbiota composition that occur in individuals with MCI due to AD. In particular, the correlation analysis results between PET amyloid burden and gut microbial abundance showed that amyloid deposition is associated with a reduction in specific taxa involved in butyrate production.
