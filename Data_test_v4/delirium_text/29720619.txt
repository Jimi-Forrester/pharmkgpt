29720619|t|N-Alkylation of functionalized amines with alcohols using a copper-gold mixed photocatalytic system.
29720619|a|Direct functionalization of amino groups in complex organic molecules is one of the most important key technologies in modern organic synthesis, especially in the synthesis of bio-active chemicals and pharmaceuticals. Whereas numerous chemical reactions of amines have been developed to date, a selective, practical method for functionalizing complex amines is still highly demanded. Here we report the first late-stage N-alkylation of pharmaceutically relevant amines with alcohols at ambient temperature. This reaction was achieved by devising a mixed heterogeneous photocatalyst in situ prepared from Cu/TiO2 and Au/TiO2. The mixed photocatalytic system enabled the rapid N-alkylation of pharmaceutically relevant molecules, the selective mono- and di-alkylation of primary amines, and the non-symmetrical dialkylation of primary amines to hetero-substituted tertiary amines.
