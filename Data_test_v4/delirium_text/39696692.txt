39696692|a|OBJECTIVES: This retrospective study aimed to investigate the effects of idebenone on cognitive function and serum levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) in individuals with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). METHODS: Retrospective data were collected from the Neurology outpatient department of Liaocheng People's Hospital from January 2021 to June 2023. Patients with a newly diagnosed aMCI who received treatment were included in the idebenone treatment group. The treatment group took 30 mg of oral idebenone three times a day for 6 months. A control group of 51 MCI patients who did not receive cholinesterase inhibitors or other cognitive-enhancing drugs during the period was selected. Cognitive function assessments and serum Biomarkers were conducted before and after treatment in both groups. RESULTS: MoCA scores were significantly improved after 6 months of idebenone treatment, and the difference was statistically significant. The delayed recall score was significantly improved, and the difference was statistically significant; The level of SOD increased and the level of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein decreased after the treatment, but there was no significant change in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study demonstrate that idebenone treatment significantly improves cognitive function in individuals with aMCI, particularly in the domain of delayed memory. In addition, idebenone reduces the degree of inflammation and oxidative stress and improves antioxidant levels. These findings suggest that idebenone may be a promising intervention for the management of cognitive impairments associated with aMCI.
