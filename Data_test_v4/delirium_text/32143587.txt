32143587|a|BACKGROUND: Aetiology of transient global amnesia (TGA) remains uncertain, though many have been proposed, including ischaemic, migrainous or epileptic pathologies. METHODS: We attempted to determine risk factors for TGA, as well as prognostic factors that may cause recurrence. We evaluated clinical history, family history and magnetic resonance diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) studies of 93 prospective patients with TGA. Patients were followed from 2004 to 2016. Fifteen of 93 (16%) patients experienced a recurrence of TGA. RESULTS: Among precipitating events, physical activities inducing Valsalva-like manoeuvres were most common, followed by emotional stress. Eighty-four patients had possible comorbidities or risk factors for TGA, though no single risk factor was ubiquitous. Risk factors associated with recurrence were head injury (isolated vs. recurrent, 16.7% vs. 53.5%, p < 0.01), depression (isolated vs. recurrent, 15.4% vs 46.7%, p = 0.01) and family history of dementia (isolated vs. recurrent, 20.5% vs. 46.7%, p = 0.03). Of 15 patients with confirmed recurrent TGA, two developed dementia and four subjective memory impairment. DWI lesions were observed in 24 patients and were located anywhere within the hippocampus. CONCLUSIONS: DWI lesions were not significantly associated with outcomes (recurrence, subjective memory impairment, dementia). We have found that depression, previous head injury and family history of dementia may predict TGA recurrence.
