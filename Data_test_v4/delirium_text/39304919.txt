Probiotics have been shown to play an important role in regulating the gut microbiota, but their viability and bioactivity are often compromised as they traverse the gastrointestinal tract, thereby reducing their efficacy and limiting their clinical utility. RESULTS: In this work, layer-by-layer (LbL) encapsulation technology was used to encapsulate Lactiplantibacillus plantarum (LP) to improve the above shortcomings. Studies in APPswe/PS1dE9 (APP/PS1) transgenic mice show that LbL-encapsulated LP ((CS/SP)2-LP) protects LP from gastrointestinal damage while (CS/SP)2-LP treatment It improves brain neuroinflammation and neuronal damage in AD mice, reduces Abeta deposition, improves tau protein phosphorylation levels, and restores intestinal barrier damage in AD mice. In addition, post-synaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95) expression increased in AD mice after treatment, indicating enhanced synaptic plasticity. Fecal metabolomic and microbiological analyzes showed that the disordered intestinal microbiota composition of AD mice was restored and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) levels were significantly increased after (CS/SP)2-LP treatment. CONCLUSION: Overall, the above evidence suggests that (CS/SP)2-LP can improve AD symptoms by restoring the balance of intestinal microbiota, and (CS/SP)2-LP treatment will provide a new method to improve the symptoms of AD patients.
