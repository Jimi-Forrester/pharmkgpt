37106675|t|Recent Advances in Apical Periodontitis Treatment: A Narrative Review.
37106675|a|Apical periodontitis is an inflammatory response caused by pulp infection. It induces bone resorption in the apical and periapical regions of the tooth. The most conservative approach to treat this condition is nonsurgical endodontic treatment. However, clinical failure has been reported with this approach; thus, alternative procedures are required. This review highlights recent literature regarding advanced approaches for the treatment of apical periodontitis. Various therapies, including biological medications, antioxidants, specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators, and stem cell therapy, have been tested to increase the success rate of treatment for apical periodontitis. Some of these approaches remain in the in vivo phase of research, while others have just entered the translational research phase to validate clinical application. However, a detailed understanding of the molecular mechanisms that occur during development of the immunoinflammatory reaction in apical periodontitis remains unclear. The aim of this review was to summarize advanced approaches for the treatment of apical periodontitis. Further research can confirm the potential of these alternative nonsurgical endodontic treatment approaches.
