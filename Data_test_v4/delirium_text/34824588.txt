34824588|t|The Modulation of Working-Memory Performance Using Gamma-Electroacupuncture and Theta-Electroacupuncture in Healthy Adults.
34824588|a|Working memory (WM), a central component of general cognition, plays an essential role in human beings' daily lives. WM impairments often occur in psychiatric, neurodegenerative, and neurodevelopmental disorders, mainly presenting as loss of high-load WM. In previous research, electroacupuncture (EA) has been shown to be an effective treatment for cognitive impairments. Frequency parameters are an important factor in therapeutic results, but the optimal frequency parameters of EA have not yet been identified. In this study, we chose theta-EA (theta-EA; 6 Hz) and gamma-EA (gamma-EA; 40 Hz), corresponding to the transcranial alternating-current stimulation (tACS) frequency parameters at the Baihui (DU20) and Shenting (DU24) acupoints, in order to compare the effects of different EA frequencies on WM. We evaluated WM performance using visual 1-back, 2-back, and 3-back WM tasks involving digits. Each participant (N = 30) attended three different sessions in accordance with a within-subject crossover design. We performed theta-EA, gamma-EA, and sham-EA in a counterbalanced order, conducting the WM task both before and after intervention. The results showed that d-prime (d') under all three stimulation conditions had no significance in the 1-back and 2-back tasks. However, in the 3-back task, there was a significant improvement in d' after intervention compared to d' before intervention under theta-EA (F [1, 29] = 22.64; P < 0.001), while we saw no significant difference in the gamma-EA and sham-EA groups. Reaction times for hits (RT-hit) under all three stimulation conditions showed decreasing trends in 1-, 2-, and 3-back tasks but without statistically significant differences. These findings suggest that the application of theta-EA might facilitate high-load WM performance.
