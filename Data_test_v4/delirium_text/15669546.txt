15669546|a|There are no new data in the Women's Health Initiative. The Collaborative Study of Hormone Factors in breast cancer showed a non-significant increased risk after 5 years. HERS showed an increased risk of cardiovascular disease in HT users with previous heart disease. The Cache County study indicated that estrogen therapy initiated after age 60 increased the incidence of Alzheimer's disease. The daily progestogen in the HT users decreased the estrogen receptors in the coronary arteries and minimized the beneficial direct effect of estrogen. It also decreased progesterone receptors in the endometrium, thus making it less endometrial-protective. The WHI was contrary to previous studies of estrogen therapy because women with specific menopausal symptoms were excluded, were older, had never used estrogen and had long-term estrogen deficiency. It takes healthy tissue to allow an effective response to estrogen and maintenance of health. Maximal benefit of HT may require early onset of treatment, near the time of menopause. However, it is never too late to arrest the progression of osteoporosis and decrease the risk of fracture.
