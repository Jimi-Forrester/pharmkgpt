36708807|t|The Integrative Studies on the Functional A-to-I RNA Editing Events in Human Cancers.
36708807|a|Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing, constituting nearly 90% of all RNA editing events in humans, has been reported to contribute to the tumorigenesis in diverse cancers. However, the comprehensive map for functional A-to-I RNA editing events in cancers is still insufficient. To fill this gap, we systematically and intensively analyzed multiple tumorigenic mechanisms of A-to-I RNA editing events in samples across 33 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas. For individual candidate among ~ 1.5 M quantified RNA editing events, we performed diverse types of down-stream functional annotations. Finally, we identified 24,236 potentially functional A-to-I RNA editing events, including the cases in APOL1, IGFBP3, GRIA2, BLCAP, and miR-589-3p. These events might play crucial roles in the scenarios of tumorigenesis, due to their tumor-related editing frequencies or probable effects on altered expression profiles, protein functions, splicing patterns, and microRNAs regulations of tumor genes. Our functional A-to-I RNA editing events (https://ccsm.uth.edu/CAeditome/) will help better understanding of cancer pathology from A-to-I RNA editing aspect.
