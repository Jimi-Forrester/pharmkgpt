38350846|a|BACKGROUND: Comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) involves a formal broad approach to assess frailty and creating a plan for management. However, the impact of CGA and its components on listing for kidney transplant in older adults has not been investigated. METHODS: We performed a single-center retrospective study of patients with end-stage renal disease who underwent CGA during kidney transplant candidacy evaluation between 2017 and 2021. All patients >= 65 years old and those under 65 with any team member concern for frailty were referred for CGA, which included measurements of healthcare utilization, comorbidities, social support, short physical performance battery, Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and Physical Frailty Phenotype (FPP), and estimate of surgical risk by the geriatrician. RESULTS: Two hundred and thirty patients underwent baseline CGA evaluation; 58.7% (135) had high CGA ("Excellent" or "Good" rating for transplant candidacy) and 41.3% (95) had low CGA ratings ("Borderline," "Fair," or "Poor"). High CGA rating (OR 8.46; p < 0.05), greater number of CGA visits (OR 4.93; p = 0.05), younger age (OR 0.88; p < 0.05), higher MoCA scores (OR 1.17; p < 0.05), and high physical activity (OR 4.41; p < 0.05) were all associated with listing on transplant waitlist. CONCLUSIONS: The CGA is a useful, comprehensive tool to help select older adults for kidney transplantation. Further study is needed to better understand the predictive value of CGA in predicting post-operative outcomes.
