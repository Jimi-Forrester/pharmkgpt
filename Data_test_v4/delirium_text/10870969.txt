10870969|a|Blood plasma proteins of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD; senile dementia) and non-AD-type dementia were resolved by two-dimensional electrophoresis and identified by migration position in the electrophoresis pattern, sequence homology, and immunodetection by using antibodies. For the control experiments, blood plasma proteins of a healthy young individual and non-dementia patients were examined in a manner similar to that of the plasma samples of AD patients. In the plasma sample of the healthy young individual, more than 350 spots of silver-stained proteins were observed and among these spots, 73 spots were identified. Blood plasma proteins of the AD and non-AD-type dementia patients were compared with those of the control and non-dementia patients. In the blood plasma samples of five AD patients, three patients had apolipoprotein E4, and another patient showed apolipoprotein L and complement factor H. For the AD-related proteins apolipoprotein E, tau-1, and presenilin 2, proteins were examined by immunostaining with antibodies, in both AD and non-AD patients. Among the three samples of non-AD-type dementia patients, one was distinguishable by amyloid A proteins, and the other by haptoglobin isoforms.
