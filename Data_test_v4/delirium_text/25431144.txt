25431144|t|Preparation, anticholinesterase activity, and docking study of new 2-butenediamide and oxalamide derivatives.
25431144|a|Several new oxalamide and 2-butenediamide derivatives have been designed, synthesized and evaluated as the acetyl- and butyryl-cholinesterase inhibitors for Alzheimer's disease. The enzyme inhibitory activity of the synthesized compounds was measured using Ellman's colorimetric method. It was revealed that compound 1a (N,N'-bis-(4-chloro-benzyl)-N,N'-diphenyl-oxalamide) showed maximum activity against BuChE with a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) = 1.86 microM and compound 2a (but-2-enedioic acid bis-[(4-chloro-benzyl)-phenyl-amide]) exhibited optimum AChE (IC50 = 1.51 microM) inhibition with a high-selectivity index. To better understand the enzyme-inhibitor interaction of the most active compounds towards cholinesterase, molecular modelling studies were carried out. Docking simulations revealed that inhibitors 1a and 2a targeted both the catalytic active site and the peripheral anionic site of 1ACJ and 1P0I.
