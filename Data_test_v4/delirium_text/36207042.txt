36207042|t|Instruments to measure postintensive care syndrome: a scoping review protocol.
36207042|a|INTRODUCTION: There is an increasing need for evaluating postintensive care syndrome in adults concerning their long-term physical, psychological, cognitive and/or social outcomes, yet there is no consensus regarding the choice of instruments to measure these. This scoping review aims to identify and examine instruments used to measure postintensive care syndrome in adults. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This scoping review will be conducted following the Arksey and O'Malley and its extended framework, and the Joanna Briggs Institute guideline. It will be reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses extension for Scoping Review checklists. Medline via EBSCO, CINAHL complete, EMBASE, Web of Science, AME and APA PsycINFO databases and grey literature will be searched from 2010 to the present. Reference lists of included studies will be manually checked to identify additional sources. The quality of included studies will be appraised using the Crowe Critical Appraisal Tool. All review steps will involve at least two reviewers. Data charting will be performed narratively, comprising study characteristics and findings, and instrument properties. This review will also aim to identify research gaps. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: There is no ethics disclosure for this review protocol. This scoping review will identify instruments used to measure postintensive care syndrome in adults. The findings will be disseminated through professional bodies, conferences and research papers.
