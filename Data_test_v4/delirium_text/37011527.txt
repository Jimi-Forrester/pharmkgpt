37011527|a|Our study assessed diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics of fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), and radial diffusivity (RD) in pediatric subjects with epilepsy secondary to Focal Cortical Dysplasia (FCD) to improve our understanding of structural network changes associated with FCD related epilepsy. We utilized a data harmonization (DH) approach to minimize confounding effects induced by MRI protocol differences. We also assessed correlations between DTI metrics and neurocognitive measures of the fluid reasoning index (FRI), verbal comprehension index (VCI), and visuospatial index (VSI). Data (n = 51) from 23 FCD patients and 28 typically developing controls (TD) scanned clinically on either 1.5T, 3T, or 3T-wide-bore MRI were retrospectively analyzed. Tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) with threshold-free cluster enhancement and permutation testing with 100,000 permutations were used for statistical analysis. To account for imaging protocol differences, we employed non-parametric data harmonization prior to permutation testing. Our analysis demonstrates that DH effectively removed MRI protocol-based differences typical in clinical acquisitions while preserving group differences in DTI metrics between FCD and TD subjects. Furthermore, DH strengthened the association between DTI metrics and neurocognitive indices. Fractional anisotropy, MD, and RD metrics showed stronger correlation with FRI and VSI than VCI. Our results demonstrate that DH is an integral step to reduce the confounding effect of MRI protocol differences during the analysis of white matter tracts and highlights biological differences between FCD and healthy control subjects. Characterization of white matter changes associated with FCD-related epilepsy may better inform prognosis and treatment approaches.
