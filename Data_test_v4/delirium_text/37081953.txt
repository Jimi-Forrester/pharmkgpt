37081953|a|Introduction: This study examined whether the association between sarcopenia severity and cognitive function differed according to sex and age in community-dwelling older adults in Japan. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study of older adults (age >= 65 years) consisting of five regional cohorts integrated as the Integrated Research Initiative for Living Well with Dementia (IRIDE) Cohort Study. Sarcopenia severity was determined based on the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia 2019, which assessed grip strength, walking speed, and skeletal muscle mass index. Poor cognitive function was defined as a Mini-Mental State Examination score of <= 23. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for poor cognitive function were calculated by sex and age group (65-74 and >=75 years) using binomial logistic regression models, which were adjusted for age, educational attainment, history of non-communicable diseases, smoking and drinking habits, living alone, frequency of going outdoors, exercise habits, and depressive symptom. Results: Of the 8,180 participants, 6,426 (1,157 men aged 65-74 and 1,063 men aged 75 or older; 2,281 women aged 65-74 and 1,925 women aged 75 or older) were analyzed. The prevalence ratio of sarcopenia and severe sarcopenia were 309 (13.9%) and 92 (4.1%) among men and 559 (13.3%) and 166 (3.7%) among women, respectively. A total of 127 (5.8%) men and 161 (3.9%) women had a poor cognitive function. Setting non-sarcopenia as a reference, the adjusted ORs (95% CI) of poor cognitive function were 2.20 (1.54, 3.15) for sarcopenia and 3.56 (2.20, 5.71) for severe sarcopenia. A similar trend was observed in analyses stratified by sex and age, with linear associations (P for trend <0.05) in both categories. Furthermore, there was a significant interaction (P < 0.05) between sex and sarcopenia severity, indicating a stronger linear association of sarcopenia severity with poor cognitive function in women compared with men. Discussion and conclusion: Sarcopenia severity was linearly associated with poor cognitive function in adults aged >= 65 years, with a stronger association in women compared with men.
