39064712|t|Maternal Dietary Carbohydrate and Pregnancy Outcomes: Quality over Quantity.
39064712|a|Dietary nutrition plays a crucial role in determining pregnancy outcomes, with poor diet being a major contributor to pregnancy metabolic syndrome and metabolic disorders in offspring. While carbohydrates are essential for fetal development, the excessive consumption of low-quality carbohydrates can increase the risk of pregnancy complications and have lasting negative effects on offspring development. Recent studies not only highlighted the link between carbohydrate intake during pregnancy, maternal health, and offspring well-being, but also suggested that the quality of carbohydrate foods consumed is more critical. This article reviews the impacts of low-carbohydrate and high-carbohydrate diets on pregnancy complications and offspring health, introduces the varied physiological effects of different types of carbohydrate consumption during pregnancy, and emphasizes the importance of both the quantity and quality of carbohydrates in nutritional interventions during pregnancy. These findings may offer valuable insights for guiding dietary interventions during pregnancy and shaping the future development of carbohydrate-rich foods.
