38344140|t|Circumferential tracheal replacement with silicone stent supported, cryopreserved aortic homograft.
38344140|a|Treatment of long-segment tracheal defects remains a challenge in thoracic surgery with no standard surgical option. Aortic allografts have been used for this purpose with varying degrees of success. In a patient that suffered anastomotic dehiscence after tracheal resection with primary anastomosis, we performed complete tracheal resection and replacement using a stented circumferential aortic allograft. Currently, this patient is able to breathe normally without tracheostomy assistance 22 months postoperatively. Our report is the first in the English literature of long-term survival without tracheostomy dependence and close interval follow-up after circumferential tracheal resection and replacement with a cryopreserved aortic allograft.
