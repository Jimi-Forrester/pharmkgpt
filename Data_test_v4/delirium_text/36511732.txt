36511732|a|BACKGROUND: Transient, acute delirium after electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) occurs in approximately one in eight patients. This case report describes a man with no known risk factors who developed a rare form of delirium, which is of longer duration and occurs longer after electroconvulsive therapy. CASE PRESENTATION: A man in his forties with major depression with psychosis was admitted to the acute psychiatric ward after his sixth ECT treatment. He was disoriented, walked around restlessly, and seemed suspicious. He could not understand instructions and he ate his meals while wandering around. He constantly asked where he was. INTERPRETATION: Despite having no risk factors (advanced age, cardiovascular disease, dementia, Parkinson's disease, unilateral stimulation) for developing post-ECT delirium, our patient developed this after his sixth treatment. Post-ECT delirium should be known by anyone working with patients receiving ECT and good routines should be in place for monitoring cognitive side effects during an ECT series.
