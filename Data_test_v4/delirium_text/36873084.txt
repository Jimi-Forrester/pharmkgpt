36873084|a|A 47-year-old woman with acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) has had recurring symptoms after achieving biochemical normalization of her urinary 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA), porphobilinogen (PBG), and total porphyrins with givosiran. She has had normal liver tests, mildly decreased renal function, and sustained normal urinary ALA, PBG, and porphyrins with no rebound in her laboratory test results throughout treatment. She continues to tolerate monthly givosiran injections with no adverse effects, but she still experiences what she believes are acute porphyric attacks every 1-2 months.
