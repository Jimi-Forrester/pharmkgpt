35165609|t|Lund University Cardiac Arrest System and Percutaneous Coronary Intervention During Cardiac Arrest: Case Report and Review of Literature.
35165609|a|We present a case of a 45-year-old female who presented to a community hospital with an anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) that subsequently developed prolonged ventricular fibrillation (VF) refractory to repeated defibrillation and antiarrhythmic medications. Primary percutaneous coronary intervention was performed in the patient with VF but supported only by the Lund University Cardiac Arrest System (LUCAS). Despite a total VF time of 127 minutes, the patient was eventually discharged neurologically intact with a normal left ventricular function. For the right patient, this case illustrates the utility of the LUCAS device, especially at community hospitals without immediate venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or ventricular assist device capability.
