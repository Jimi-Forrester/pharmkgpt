36521347|t|Time-lagged relationships between a decade of air pollution exposure and first hospitalization with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias.
36521347|a|Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) poses substantial health challenges among an aging population. One of the primary challenges in studying ADRD is that biological processes underlying these ailments begin decades prior to diagnosis. Previous studies indicate a relationship between ADRD and air pollution exposure to both fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) but are limited in their interpretation because they consider exposure measurements at a single time point. Our retrospective cohort study considered 27 + million Medicare enrollees in the United States followed up to 17 years and matched with highly accurate annual air pollution exposure measurements for PM2.5, NO2, and summer ozone. We applied distributed lag models and estimated the lagged associations between air pollution and odds of first hospitalization with ADRD. We found significantly increased odds due to overall PM2.5 and NO2 exposure and time-lagged exposure 10 and 8 years prior to admission, respectively. Furthermore, we found the connection between air pollution exposure and increased odds of first hospitalization with ADRD exists at air pollution levels below current National Ambient Air Quality Standards set by the US Environmental Protection Agency, with the steepest increase in odds occurring at low concentrations of PM2.5. Our findings are the first to show that air pollution exposures from as many as 10 years prior to the admission are related to increased odds of hospitalizations with ADRD. As there are no clear treatments available for ADRD, identifying modifiable risk factors such as air pollution exposure may make significant contributions towards prevention or delayed disease progression.
