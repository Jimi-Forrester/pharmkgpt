37238972|a|Polypharmacy, potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs), and drug-to-drug interactions (DDIs) are highly prevalent in the elderly and may have adverse effects on health-related outcomes. Their occurrence and clinical and prognostic associations in patients with chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) are unknown. We retrospectively evaluated polypharmacy, PIMs, and DDIs in a cohort of 124 MPN patients (essential thrombocythemia, ET = 63, polycythemia vera, PV = 44, myelofibrosis = 9, MPN unclassifiable = 8) from a single community hematology practice. There were 761 drug prescriptions with a median of five prescribed medications per patient. Polypharmacy, at least one PIM (calculated for persons >60 years of age, n = 101), and at least one DDI were recorded in 76 (61.3%), 46 (45.5%), and 77 (62.1%) of patients, respectively. Seventy-four (59.6%) and twenty-one (16.9%) patients had at least one C or at least one D interaction, respectively. Among other associations, polypharmacy and DDIs were associated with older age, management of disease-related symptoms, osteoarthritis/osteoporosis, and different CV disorders. In multivariate analyses adjusted for clinically meaningful parameters, both polypharmacy and DDIs were significantly associated with inferior overall survival (OS) and time to thrombosis (TTT), whereas PIMs had no significant associations with neither OS nor TTT. There were no associations with bleeding or transformation risks. Polypharmacy, DDIs, and PIMs are very frequent among MPN patients and may have important clinical associations.
