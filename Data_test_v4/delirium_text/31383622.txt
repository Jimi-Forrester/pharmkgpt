31383622|a|BACKGROUND: The pathological impact of chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) on Alzheimer's disease (AD) is still poorly understood. In the present study, we investigated the role of CCH on an AD mouse model in phosphorylated tau and alpha-synuclein pathology, neurovascular unit, cerebrovascular remodeling, and neurovascular trophic coupling. Moreover, examined protective effect of a new antioxidant Twendee X (TwX). METHODS: APP23 mice were implanted to bilateral common carotid arteries stenosis with ameroid constrictors to gradually decrease the cerebral blood flow. The effects of the administration of TwX were evaluated by immunohistochemical analysis and Immunofluorescent histochemistry. RESULTS: The present study revealed that the expressions of phospho-tau and phospho-alpha-synuclein were significantly increased in the APP23 + CCH mice group as compared with wild type and APP23 mice groups (*P < .05 and **P < .01 versus WT; #P < .05 and ##P < .01 versus APP23). In addition, CCH significantly exacerbated MMP-9 activation relating to blood-brain barrier destruction (**P < .01 versus WT; #P < .05, and ##P < .01 versus APP23), enhanced neurovascular remodeling, and impaired a neurovascular trophic coupling in the vascular endothelial BDNF expression of the APP23 + CCH group. TwX treatment (20 mg/kg/day, from 4.5 to 12 months) significantly reduced tau and alpha-synuclein pathologies, ameliorated neurovascular dysfunction compared with APP23 + CCH group. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that administration of a new antioxidative mixture TwX substantially reduced the above neuropathologic abnormalities, suggesting a potential therapeutic benefit of TwX for AD with CCH.
