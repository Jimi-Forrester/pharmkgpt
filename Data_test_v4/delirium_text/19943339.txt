19943339|t|Synaptotagmins in neurodegeneration.
19943339|a|Synaptotagmins (Syts) are transmembrane proteins involved in the regulation of membrane trafficking. Here, we summarize literature data that provide growing evidence that several Syts are involved in the pathophysiological mechanisms of temporal lobe epilepsy and Parkinson's disease, as well as few reports related to brain ischemia and Alzheimer's disease (AD). We also report new data from our laboratories, showing changes of the expression of several Syts in Tg2576 mouse model of AD that may be related to neuroinflammation surrounding the beta-amyloid plaques. Furthermore, we demonstrate N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-mediated upregulation of Syt 4 mRNA in a model of excitotoxic striatal lesion induced by unilateral striatal injection of quinolinic acid, associating the upregulation of Syt 4 with mechanisms of excitotoxicity. We propose that pharmacological manipulation of Syt expression in animal models of neurodegeneration should be further explored, as it may help to clarify the role of individual Syt isoforms in the regulation of membrane trafficking in neurodegeneration.
