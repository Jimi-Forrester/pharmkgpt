37274045|a|BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates worldwide. Older patients have a degenerative cardiopulmonary function, weak compensatory capacity, and poor surgical tolerance. Therefore, the mode of anesthesia must be optimized. Remimazolam is a new ultrashort-acting benzodiazepine with a rapid onset of action, rapid metabolism, and mild effects on pulmonary circulation. Remimazolam sedation combined with an epidural block has not been reported in hypertensive older adults with severe COPD and inguinal mass resection. CASE SUMMARY: We report the case of a 73-year-old man with hypertension and severe COPD, who underwent resection of an enlarged inguinal mass that he had noticed more than 7 mo before presentation. The patient presented with a "right inguinal mass" and was recommended to undergo an enlarged inguinal mass resection. Surgery was relatively challenging, due to the large mass (13 cm x 8 cm x 7 cm), hard texture, and poor mobility. Considering the advanced age of the patient, grade III hypertension, and severe COPD, we administered remimazolam combined with an epidural block for anesthesia to ensure perioperative safety and careful consideration. The anesthetic effect was precise; the procedure was performed smoothly without any complications, and the patient was successfully anesthetized. However, anesthetic management in such cases has not yet been reported by previous studies. CONCLUSION: Remimazolam sedation combined with an epidural block is safe and effective in older patients with hypertension and severe COPD.
