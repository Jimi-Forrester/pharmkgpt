35769382|a|In this work, we exploited an efficient method to release hemicellulosic polysaccharides (BLHP) from bamboo (Phyllostachys pubescens Mazel) leaves assisted by a small amount of phosphotungstic acid. Structural unit analysis proved that BLHP-A1 and BLHP-B1 samples possessed abundant low-branch chains in  4)-beta-D-Xylp-(1  skeleton mainly consisting of Xylp, Manp, Glcp, Galp, and Araf residues. According to the results of the antioxidant activity assays in vitro, both of the two fractions demonstrated the activity for scavenging DPPH  and ABTS+ radicals and exhibited relatively a high reducing ability compared to the recently reported polysaccharides. Moreover, the antioxidant activities of purified polysaccharides were evaluated against H2O2-induced oxidative stress damage in HepG2 cells. BLHP-B1 showed more activity for preventing damages from H2O2 in HepG2 cells by improving the enzyme activities of SOD, CAT, and GSH-Px and decreasing the production of MDA as well as suppressing reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation. This study implied that BLHP could demonstrate its attenuation ability for oxidative stress in HepG2 cells.
