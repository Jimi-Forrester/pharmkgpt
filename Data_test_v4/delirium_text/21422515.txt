21422515|t|Activation of the alpha-secretase processing of AbetaPP as a therapeutic approach in Alzheimer's disease.
21422515|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is by far the main cause of dementia in the aged population. Because the amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) is the main component of senile plaques that develop in the brain of affected patients, numerous studies aimed at preventing its production or aggregation were conducted during the past 25 years. The inhibition of Abeta production via pharmacological inhibition of beta- and gamma-secretases is, with vaccination, one of the two main current challenges aimed at curing AD. However, the fact that there exist numerous substrates of these two activities renders this approach problematic since treatments with beta- or gamma-secretase inhibitors can cause deleterious effects. An alternative to the inhibition of the amyloidogenic enzymes would be to activate the alpha-secretase processing of AbetaPP. This cleavage is performed by two members of the disintegrin family of metalloproteases (ADAM10 and ADAM17). It is noteworthy that this cleavage can be seen as doubly beneficial regarding AD since it both occurs in the middle of the Abeta sequence and triggers the release of the neuroprotective sAbetaPPalpha product. However, similarly to beta- and gamma-secretases, ADAM10 and ADAM17 are responsible for the cleavage of a large number of proteins, the processing of some of them being tightly associated with important physiological functions but also with severe pathologies. This review focuses on our current knowledge of the various natural or synthetic compounds able to trigger alpha-secretase activities and on the possible ways to circumvent the deleterious side effects that would result from their broad activation.
