216105|t|[A new therapeutical approach in neurology (author's transl)].
216105|a|The therapeutic action of Tiapridal appeared to the authors particularly precious and constant in delirium tremens, senile agitation and turbulence, whatever the origin, and bucco-linguo-facial dyskinesia, whether the latter were linked to age or whether they formed part of a neuroleptic syndrome. Their experience does not permit them to have any opinion concerning the use of this drug in tremor and chorea, the patients seem to respond favourably to treatment but in an erratic manner. On the other hand the drug was totally inefficacious in patients suffering from spasmodic torticollis and writer's cramp. Finally, it seemed to them useful to emphasise the improvement in comfort in patients suffering from various pains when given Tiapridal. This justifies the place given to Tiapridal among drugs necessary for the daily practice of neurology.
