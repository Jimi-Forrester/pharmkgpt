11128060|t|Perioperative temporal profile of cognitive function in elderly patients undergoing hip surgery.
11128060|a|To test the hypothesis that elderly patients who have surgery for femoral neck fractures may have delirium not only after surgery but before surgery, we prospectively investigated the perioperative temporal profile of cognitive function in such patients. We performed the Abbreviated Mental Test (AMT) six times in each patient (on the day of admission, 3 days after admission, on the day before surgery, 2 days after surgery, 7 days after surgery, and on the day of discharge). Patients were given no premedication and were anesthetized with spinal anesthesia using 0.2% hypobaric tetracaine. Of the 68 patients who were admitted because of a diagnosis of fractured neck of the femur and were scheduled to have surgery, 27 patients were subjected to analysis. Four and three patients showed a significant decrease (3 or more points) in AMT score 2 and 7 days after surgery, respectively. We conclude that surgery may have a stronger impact on cognitive function than environmental change shortly after admission in elderly patients with femoral neck fractures.
