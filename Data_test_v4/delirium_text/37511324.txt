37511324|t|Development of Mn2+-Specific Biosensor Using G-Quadruplex-Based DNA.
37511324|a|Metal ions are used in various situations in living organisms and as a part of functional materials. Since the excessive intake of metal ions can cause health hazards and environmental pollution, the development of new molecules that can monitor metal ion concentrations with high sensitivity and selectivity is strongly desired. DNA can form various structures, and these structures and their properties have been used in a wide range of fields, including materials, sensors, and drugs. Guanine-rich sequences respond to metal ions and form G-quadruplex structures and G-wires, which are the self-assembling macromolecules of G-quadruplex structures. Therefore, guanine-rich DNA can be applied to a metal ion-detection sensor and functional materials. In this study, the IRDAptamer library originally designed based on G-quadruplex structures was used to screen for Mn2+, which is known to induce neurodegenerative diseases. Circular dichroism and fluorescence analysis using Thioflavin T showed that the identified IRDAptamer sequence designated MnG4C1 forms a non-canonical G-quadruplex structure in response to low concentrations of Mn2+. A serum resistance and thermostability analysis revealed that MnG4C1 acquired stability in a Mn2+-dependent manner. A Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) system using fluorescent molecules attached to the termini of MnG4C1 showed that FRET was effectively induced based on Mn2+-dependent conformational changes, and the limit of detection (LOD) was 0.76 microM for Mn2+. These results suggested that MnG4C1 can be used as a novel DNA-based Mn2+-detecting molecule.
