33466170|t|Takotsubo syndrome triggered by change in position in a patient with thoracic vertebral fracture: A case report.
33466170|a|RATIONALE: Takotsubo syndrome (TTS) is characterized by recovery of wall motion abnormalities and acute left ventricular dysfunction, which are often caused by acute physical or emotional stressors. It is rarely reported that TTS can be precipitated by change in position in the patient in the operating room. We report a case of a patient with a thoracic vertebral fracture who presented with TTS precipitated by changing from a supine to a prone position before percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP) under local anesthesia. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 76-year-old man who was diagnosed with a fracture in a thoracic vertebra was sent to the operating room to undergo PKP under local anesthesia. Approximately 5 minutes after changing from a supine to a prone position, which is necessary for PKP, the patient experienced chest pain, headache, and sweating. DIAGNOSIS: A fracture in a thoracic vertebra; TTS. INTERVENTIONS: As a result of 12-lead electrocardiography, echocardiography, left ventriculogram, and cardiac catheterization, the diagnosis of TTS was retained, and supportive therapy was initiated. OUTCOMES: Two hours later, the patient's symptoms mitigated significantly and the ST segment returned to baseline. Four days later, echocardiography showed normal systolic function without wall motion abnormalities and the patient returned to the orthopedics ward for further treatment. LESSONS: It is necessary for anesthetists to recognize TTS which is life-threatening during monitored anesthetic care (MAC). We highlight the importance of being alerted to the possibility of TTS when managing patients with thoracic vertebral fractures undergoing surgery under local anesthesia.
