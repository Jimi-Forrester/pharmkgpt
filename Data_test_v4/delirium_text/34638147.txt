34638147|t|Modified Technique for Retrograde Cerebral Perfusion during Hemiarch Aortic Replacement.
34638147|a|BACKGROUND:  Uncertainty remains regarding the optimal method of brain protection for procedures that require repair or replacement of the aortic arch. We examined the early outcomes of a technique for brain protection in patients undergoing partial aortic arch (hemiarch) replacement that involves deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA) and retrograde cerebral perfusion (RCP) of cold blood from the superior vena cava toward the end of the arrest interval. METHODS:  During a recent 15-year interval, 520 patients underwent elective or urgent/emergent ascending aortic and hemiarch replacement as an isolated (47 patients) or combined (473 patients) procedure employing DHCA (mean nasopharyngeal temperature at circulatory arrest, 17.1 C and mean duration, 19.3 minutes) supplemented with RCP of cold blood from the superior vena cava toward the end of the arrest interval (mean, 6.7 minutes). The mean age of the patients was 59.5 years, and 65% were male. RESULTS:  The in-hospital and 30-day mortality rates were 1.2% (six patients). Seven patients (1.4%) sustained a stroke and 19 patients (3.7%) had transient neurologic dysfunction that completely resolved by the time of hospital discharge. Four patients (0.77%) developed postoperative renal failure requiring dialysis. Twenty-one patients (4%) required ventilator support for >48 hours and five patients (0.96%) required a tracheostomy. The median hospital length of stay was 6 days. CONCLUSION:  DHCA with a brief interval of RCP is a safe and effective technique for brain protection during hemiarch aortic replacement. RCP reduces the duration of brain ischemia and permits removal of particulate matter and air from the arterial circulation.
