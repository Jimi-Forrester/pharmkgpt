35006463|a|Coordinated sarcomere proteins produce contraction force for muscle shortening. In human ventriculum they include the cardiac myosin motor (betamys), repetitively converting ATP free energy into work, and myosin binding protein C (MYBPC3) that in complex with betamys is regulatory. Single nucleotide variants (SNVs) causing hereditary heart diseases frequently target this protein pair. The betamys/MYBPC3 complex models a regulated motor and is used here to study how the proteins couple. SNVs in betamys or MYBPC3 survey human populations worldwide. Their protein expression modifies domain structure affecting phenotype and pathogenicity outcomes. When the SNV modified domain locates to inter-protein contacts it could affect complex coordination. Domains involved, one in betamys the other in MYBPC3, form coordinated domains (co-domains). Co-domain bilateral structure implies the possibility for a shared impact from SNV modification in either domain suggesting a correlated response to a common perturbation could identify their location. Genetic divergence over human populations is proposed to perturb SNV probability coupling that is detected by cross-correlation in 2D correlation genetics (2D-CG). SNV probability data and 2D-CG identify three critical sites, two in MYBPC3 with links to several domains across the betamys motor, and, one in betamys with links to the MYBPC3 regulatory domain. MYBPC3 sites are hinges sterically enabling regulatory interactions with betamys. The betamys site is the actin binding C-loop (residues 359-377). The C-loop is a trigger for actin-activated myosin ATPase and a contraction velocity modulator. Co-domain identification implies their spatial proximity suggesting a novel approach for in vivo protein complex structure determination.
