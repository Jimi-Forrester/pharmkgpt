Researchers have shown that people with early stage Alzheimer's disease suffer less shrinkage of the brain's memory centre - the hippocampus - if they take part in moderate exercise ( page 4 ). The proof that regular walking can slow down progression of this disease should be embraced by carers. It's effective and it's free.
