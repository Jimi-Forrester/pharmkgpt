METHODS: We conducted an exploratory, observational single-center cohort study of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 from November 2020 to March 2022. Our primary outcome was persistent neurocognitive symptoms, defined as fatigue, headache, loss of taste/smell, brain fog, confusion, concentration/memory/word finding difficulty, and/or change in speech present at 1-month and persisting for 6-months following acute SARS-CoV2 infection. Secondary outcomes included persistent impairment scores on PROMIS cognitive function and abilities scales. Multivariate logistic regression analyses identified potential risk factors for neuro-PASC. RESULTS: Of 89 participants, 60% reported persistent neurocognitive symptoms at 6-months; fatigue was the most prevalent, occurring in 53% of participants, followed by brain fog in 34% of participants. Lower self-reported socioeconomic status and increased pre-COVID-19 anxiety scores on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale were associated with increased odds of developing persistent neurocognitive symptoms. Being female and of Hispanic descent were associated with increased odds of persistent cognitive function and ability impairment. INTERPRETATION: Sociodemographic factors and pre-COVID-19 anxiety symptoms may be important risk factors for neuro-PASC. These findings underscore the need to assess various sociodemographic factors in research on PASC. Our study also highlights premorbid mental health symptoms as a potential predictor of persistent neurocognitive symptoms following hospitalization with SARS-CoV2 infection.
