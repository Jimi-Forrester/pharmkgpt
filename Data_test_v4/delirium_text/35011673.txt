35011673|a|The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1alpha (PGC-1alpha) is a well-known transcriptional coactivator involved in mitochondrial biogenesis. PGC-1alpha is implicated in the pathophysiology of many neurodegenerative disorders; therefore, a deep understanding of its functioning in the nervous system may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies. The central nervous system (CNS)-specific isoforms of PGC-1alpha have been recently identified, and many functions of PGC-1alpha are assigned to the particular cell types of the central nervous system. In the mice CNS, deficiency of PGC-1alpha disturbed viability and functioning of interneurons and dopaminergic neurons, followed by alterations in inhibitory signaling and behavioral dysfunction. Furthermore, in the ALS rodent model, PGC-1alpha protects upper motoneurons from neurodegeneration. PGC-1alpha is engaged in the generation of neuromuscular junctions by lower motoneurons, protection of photoreceptors, and reduction in oxidative stress in sensory neurons. Furthermore, in the glial cells, PGC-1alpha is essential for the maturation and proliferation of astrocytes, myelination by oligodendrocytes, and mitophagy and autophagy of microglia. PGC-1alpha is also necessary for synaptogenesis in the developing brain and the generation and maintenance of synapses in postnatal life. This review provides an outlook of recent studies on the role of PGC-1alpha in various cells in the central nervous system.
