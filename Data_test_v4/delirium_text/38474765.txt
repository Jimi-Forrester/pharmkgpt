38474765|a|Previous studies have investigated the association between diet and cognitive impairment, yet there is limited investigation into the link between edible mushrooms and algae intake and cognitive decline. This study aims to explore the association between edible mushrooms and algae intake and the risk of cognitive impairment in individuals aged 65 years and above in China. Cross-sectional data from the 2018 Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS) formed the basis of this study. Edible mushrooms and algae intake was evaluated using a simplified food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) and cognitive function was assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). A binary logistic regression model was used to evaluate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), with subgroup analysis conducted. Among 14,150 older adults, the average age was (85.33 +- 11.55), with a cognitive impairment prevalence of 22.7; multi-model adjustments showed a 25.3% lower probability of cognitive impairment for those occasionally consuming edible mushrooms and algae (OR: 0.747, 95% CI: 0.675~0.826). Furthermore, a 29% lower risk was observed in those with daily intake (OR: 0.710, 95% CI: 0.511~0.987). Subgroup analysis demonstrated significant risk reduction in women (OR: 0.589, 95% CI: 0.375~0.925, p = 0.022), individuals with disability in activities of daily living (OR: 0.568, 95% CI: 0.367~0.878, p = 0.011), and those with low social activity levels (OR: 0.671, 95% CI: 0.473~0.950, p = 0.025). This study concludes that edible mushrooms and algae intake significantly impacts the risk of cognitive impairment in older adults. These results provide insights and impetus for further research into this area. Additional cohort studies or intervention trials are necessary to confirm the potential benefits of edible mushrooms and algae in promoting cognitive health.
