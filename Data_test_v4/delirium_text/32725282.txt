32725282|a|Nowadays, the worldwide interest is growing to use medicinal plants and their active constituents to develop new potent medicines with fewer side effects. Precise dietary compounds have prospective beneficial applications for various neurodegenerative ailments. Rosmarinic acid is a polyphenol and is detectable most primarily in many Lamiaceae families, for instance, Rosmarinus officinalis also called rosemary. This review prepared a broad and updated literature review on rosmarinic acid elucidating its biological activities on some nervous system disorders. Rosmarinic acid has significant antinociceptive, neuroprotective, and neuroregenerative effects. In this regard, we classified and discussed our findings in different nervous system disorders including Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, depression, Huntington's disease, familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury, spinal cord injury, stress, anxiety, and pain.
