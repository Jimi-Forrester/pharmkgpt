15339638|t|Food for thought: essential fatty acid protects against neuronal deficits in transgenic mouse model of AD.
15339638|a|Interactions between environmental and genetic factors may contribute to neurodegenerative disease. In this issue of Neuron, Calon et al. report that a diet low in an essential omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (docosahexaenoic acid) depletes postsynaptic proteins and exacerbates behavioral alterations in a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
