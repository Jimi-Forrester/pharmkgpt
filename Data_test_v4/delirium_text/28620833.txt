28620833|a|Low levels of serum uric acid (UA) are a risk factor for many neurodegenerative diseases but the role of UA in tauopathies has not been yet fully evaluated. In this study, we assessed the risk associated with serum UA levels in a large group of patients with tauopathies, either primary or secondary. The mean serum UA concentrations of 111 patients with tauopathies (TAU), including 41 with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), 45 with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 25 with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) were compared to that of 130 controls (CTL). The association between serum UA and TAU condition, PSP, AD and FTD was calculated as odd ratio (OR) adjusted for age and gender. A cut-off value of serum UA was finally obtained to predict subjects at risk for TAU. The serum UA levels in TAU and PSP, AD and FTD subgroups were similar, and significantly lower than CTL. Linear regression revealed inverse relationships between UA and TAU (OR = 0.610), PSP (OR = 0.626), AD (OR = 0.685) and FTD (OR = 0.577). The cut-off value of 4.35 mg/dl (AUC = 0.655) discriminates TAU from CTL, although with poor specificity and sensitivity. Low concentrations of serum UA represent a common risk factor for different tauopathies (PSP, FTD and AD). These findings may represent a starting point for preventive strategies or novel therapeutic approaches in this group of severe neurodegenerative diseases.
