32092863|t|Survival Analysis of Hospitalized Elderly People with Fractures in Brazil Over One Year.
32092863|a|OBJECTIVE: This study analyzes the causes of death, survival, and other related factors in hospitalized elderly people with fractures over the course of one year. METHODS: We followed 376 fracture patients for one year in a prospective cohort study to a reference hospital in central Brazil. The Cox regression model was used to analyze factors associated with survival. RESULTS: The results indicate that the one-year mortality rate was high (22.9%). The independent factors linked to lower overall survival were as follows: patients aged >80 years with previous intensive care unit (ICU) admission and presence of comorbidities (diabetes mellitus [DM] and dementia). CONCLUSION: Our study results may contribute to a better understanding of the impact of fractures on the elderly population and reinforce the need to oversee age-groups, diabetic patients, and patients with complications during hospitalization.
