14512817|t|Therapeutic strategies for Alzheimer disease: focus on neuronal reactivation of metabolically impaired neurons.
14512817|a|Based on several lines of evidence, it has been hypothesized that decreased neuronal metabolic rate may precede cognitive impairment, contributing to neuronal atrophy as well as reduced neuronal function in Alzheimer disease (AD). Additionally, studies have shown that stimulation of neurons through different mechanisms may protect those cells from the deleterious effects of aging and AD, a phenomenon we paraphrased as "use it or lose it." Therefore, it is attractive to direct the development of therapeutic strategies toward stimulation of metabolic rate/neuronal activity to improve cognition and other symptoms in AD. A number of pharmacological and nonpharmacological approaches discussed here support the concept that stimulation of the brain has beneficial effects and may, to a certain degree, restore several aspects of cognition and other central functions. For instance, the circadian system, which controls the sleep/wake cycle, may be stimulated in AD patients by exposing them to more light or transcutaneous nerve stimulation. We will also discuss a procedure that has been developed to culture human postmortem brain tissue, which allows testing of the efficacy of putative stimulatory compounds.
