37523752|a|OBJECTIVE: To understand the effects of accountable care organizations (ACOs) on use of surgery in patients with Alzheimer disease and related dementias (ADRD). STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective national cohort study of all Medicare beneficiaries identified in a 20% sample between 2010 and 2017. The primary exposure was participation in ACOs. The primary outcome was use of 1 of 6 common surgical procedures (aortic valve replacement [AVR], abdominal aortic aneurysm [AAA] repair, colectomy, carotid artery repair, major joint repair, and prostatectomy). METHODS: Multivariable logistic regression models were fit using beneficiary-year as the unit of analysis to estimate the likelihood of undergoing each procedure among patients with ADRD and without ADRD, stratified by ACO participation. Additional models were fit to determine how the relationship between ACO participation and surgery was altered based on procedure urgency and the availability of minimally invasive technology. RESULTS: Adjusted odds for use of surgery were lower among patients with ADRD compared with patients without ADRD for all procedures. ACO participation had varying impact on patients with ADRD, with higher odds of AVR and major joint surgery and lower odds of carotid artery repair. Availability of minimally invasive technology increased the likelihood of AVR and AAA repair among patients with ADRD; however, ACO participation reduced these effects. The effect of ACO participation on the likelihood of undergoing surgery did not vary by urgency of the procedure. CONCLUSIONS: The likelihood of undergoing surgery is overall lower among patients with ADRD and may vary by ACO participation for specific procedures.
