36889101|a|Much previous neuroimaging research in Alzheimer's disease has focused on the roles of amyloid and tau proteins, but recent studies have implicated microvascular changes in white matter as early indicators of damage related to later dementia. We used MRI to derive novel, non-invasive measurements of R1rho dispersion using different locking fields to characterize variations of microvascular structure and integrity in brain tissues. We developed a non-invasive 3D R1rho dispersion imaging technique using different locking fields at 3T. We acquired MR images and cognitive assessments of participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and compared them to age-matched healthy controls in a cross-sectional study. After providing informed consent, 40 adults aged 62 to 82 years (n = 17 MCI) were included in this study. White matter DeltaR1rho-fraction measured by R1rho dispersion imaging showed a strong correlation with the cognitive status of older adults (betastd = -0.4, p-value < 0.01) independent of age, in contrast to other conventional MRI markers such as T2, R1rho, and white matter hyperintense lesion volume (WMHs) measured with T2-FLAIR. The correlation of WMHs with cognitive status was no longer significant after adjusting for age and sex in linear regression analysis, and the size of the regression coefficient was substantially decreased (53% lower). This work establishes a new non-invasive method that potentially characterizes impairment of the microvascular structure of white matter in MCI patients compared to healthy controls. The application of this method in longitudinal studies would improve our fundamental understanding of the pathophysiologic changes that accompany abnormal cognitive decline with aging and help identify potential targets for treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
