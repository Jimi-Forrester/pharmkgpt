38327486|a|Background: According to a large number of scientific reports, the main problem is COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy which slowed down the vaccination program. Previous studies revealed that COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy is associated with lower cognitive performance. However, the neurobiology of such behavior is less known, and investigating the brain structural patterns in this regard can extend our knowledge on the basis of this behavior. This study aimed to investigate the link between brain structural features including cortical and subcortical volume with COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in elderly individuals. Methods: A total of 221 healthy subjects without any cognitive impairment with a mean age of 63.7 +- 6.1 were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Overall, 87 vaccine-hesitant (VH) and 134 vaccine-accepted (VA) were entered into this study. The difference in the volume of cortical and subcortical regions was investigated between VH and VA groups. Results: There was no significant difference in cognitive status measured by MMSE, MoCA, ADAS-cog, and RAVLT between VA and VH groups (P>0.05). The analysis showed that VA subjects had significantly higher left pars orbitalis (P: 0.013), left precentral (P: 0.042), right caudal anterior cingulate (P: 0.044), and right isthmus cingulate (P: 0.013) volume compared to the VH group. There was no significant difference in other cortical and subcortical regions. Conclusion: In conclusion, this finding demonstrated that in the era of complicated decision-making due to social media reports, elderly adults with smaller frontal and cingulate regions are more likely to be vaccine-hesitant. These findings can highlight the link between cortical regions and health-protective behaviors such as taking up the offer of vaccination.
