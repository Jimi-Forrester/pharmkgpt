28364127|a|Processing speed is an updated diagnostic factor for neurocognitive disorders (NCD) in DSM-5. This study investigated the characteristics of processing speed and their diagnostic values in NCD patients. A flanker test was conducted in 31 adults with NCD due to vascular disease (NCD-vascular), 36 patients with NCD due to Alzheimer's disease (NCD-AD), and 137 healthy controls. The processing speed was evaluated using two measurements: mean reaction time (RT) and intra-individual variability of RT. Mean RT represents the global processing speed. Intra-individual variability of RT is the short-term fluctuation of RT and consists of two indices, which are intra-individual coefficient of variation of reaction time (ICV-RT) and intra-individual standard deviations (iSD). We observed elevated ICV-RT and iSD in NCD-AD and NCD-vascular patients. Additionally, there was a slowed RT in NCD-AD patients. The intra-individual variability of RT had a moderate power to differentiate NCD subgroups. The mean RT was able to discriminate the NCD-AD from NCD-vascular patients. Our findings highlight the clinical utility of the combined 'two-level' measurements of processing speed to distinguish between individuals with different cognitive status. Furthermore, the 'two-level' features of processing speed embedded in the psychometric property may also reflect the diverse aetiology underlying certain 'disease-specific' neurocognitive disorders.
