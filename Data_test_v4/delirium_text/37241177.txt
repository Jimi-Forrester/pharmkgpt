37241177|a|Background and Objectives: The optimal assessment of cognitive function, including the impact of education, is crucial in managing Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study aimed to evaluate the role of cognitive reserve (CR), represented by the metabolic status of regions of the cerebral cortex, to evaluate cognitive decline considering the educational attainment of patients with AD. Materials and Methods: We used data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database, and selected 124 patients who underwent both baseline F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and F-18 florbetaben (FBB) positron emission tomography (PET) scans. Demographics, cognitive function variables (Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes [CDR]; AD Assessment Scale 11/13 [ADAS11/13] Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE]), and the average standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) of cerebral cortex regions to those of the cerebellum were obtained from the data. The participants' education level was divided into low and high education subgroups using four cut-offs of 12, 14, 16, and 18 years of educational attainment (G12, G14, G16, and G18, respectively). Demographic and cognitive function variables were compared between the two subgroups in each of the four groups, and their correlations with the SUVRs were evaluated. Results: There was no significant difference between the high and low education subgroups in each of the four groups, except for ADAS11/13 and MMSE in G14 and age in G16. The SUVRs of FDG PET (FDGSUVR) were significantly correlated with CDR, ADAS11/13, and MMSE scores. FDGSUVR showed different trajectories of neurodegeneration between the low and high education groups. Conclusions: FDGSUVR correlated moderately but significantly with neuropsychological test results, without being influenced by education level. Therefore, FDG PET may reflect CR independent of education level, and therefore could be a reliable tool to evaluate cognitive decline in AD.
