29331684|a|Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous genetic risk variants for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). However, deciphering the functional consequences of GWAS data is challenging due to a lack of reliable model systems to study the genetic variants that are often of low penetrance and non-coding identities. Pluripotent stem cell (PSC) technologies offer unprecedented opportunities for molecular phenotyping of GWAS variants in human neurons and microglia. Moreover, rapid technological advances in whole-genome RNA-sequencing and epigenome mapping fuel comprehensive and unbiased investigations of molecular alterations in PSC-derived disease models. Here, we review and discuss how integrated studies that utilize PSC technologies and genome-wide approaches may bring new mechanistic insight into the pathogenesis of AD and PD.
