METHODS: ICU patients in our hospital were randomly divided into an evidence-based nursing group (the E group) and an evidence-based nursing combined with cognitive function training group (the EC group). The incidences of delirium, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) scores, the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) scores, the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores, the Barthel Index levels, and the nursing satisfaction rates were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: Before the nursing, there were no significant differences in the MMSE scores, the NIHSS scores, the Barthel Index levels or the PSQI scores between the E group and the EC group (P>0.05). After one week of treatment, the incidences of delirium in the EC group were significantly lower than they were in the E group (P<0.05). The PSQI scores and the NIHSS scores in the EC group were significantly lower than they were in the E group (P<0.001). The MMSE scores and the Barthel Index levels in the EC group were significantly higher than they were in the E group (P<0.01). There was no significant difference in the nursing satisfaction rates between the two groups (P>0.05). CONCLUSION: Compared with using evidence-based nursing only, the combined application of evidence-based nursing and cognitive function training has a significantly better effect on the improvement of neurological function, sleep quality and normal living conditions in ICU patients.
