38412449|a|BACKGROUND: Dementia often results in postural control impairment, which could signify central nervous system dysfunction. However, no studies have compared postural control characteristics among various types of dementia. This study aimed to compare static postural control in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and vascular dementia (VaD). METHODS: Cross-sectional relationship between the clinical diagnoses (AD, DLB, VaD, or normal cognition [NC]) of outpatients at a memory clinic and their upright postural control characteristics were examined. In the postural control test, participants were instructed to maintain a static upright standing on a stabilometer for 60 seconds under the eyes-open and eyes-closed conditions. Forty postural control parameters, including distance, position, and velocity in the anterior-posterior and medio-lateral directions, derived from the trajectory of the center of mass sway, were calculated. The characteristics of each type of dementia were compared to those of NC, and the differences among the three types of dementia were evaluated using linear regression models. RESULTS: The study included 1789 participants (1206 with AD, 111 with DLB, 49 with VaD, and 423 with NC). Patients with AD exhibited distinct postural control characteristics, particularly in some distance and velocity parameters, only in the eyes-closed condition. Those with DLB exhibited features in the mean position in the anterior-posterior direction. In patients with VaD, significant differences were observed in most parameters, except power spectrum. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with AD, DLB and VaD display disease-specific postural control characteristics when compared to cognitively normal individuals.
