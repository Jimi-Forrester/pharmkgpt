34830150|t|Modulation of Neurolipid Signaling and Specific Lipid Species in the Triple Transgenic Mouse Model of Alzheimer's Disease.
34830150|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder and the most common cause of dementia in aging populations. Recently, the regulation of neurolipid-mediated signaling and cerebral lipid species was shown in AD patients. The triple transgenic mouse model (3xTg-AD), harboring betaAPPSwe, PS1M146V, and tauP301L transgenes, mimics many critical aspects of AD neuropathology and progressively develops neuropathological markers. Thus, in the present study, 3xTg-AD mice have been used to test the involvement of the neurolipid-based signaling by endocannabinoids (eCB), lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), and sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) in relation to the lipid deregulation. [35S]GTPgammaS autoradiography was used in the presence of specific agonists WIN55,212-2, LPA and CYM5442, to measure the activity mediated by CB1, LPA1, and S1P1 Gi/0 coupled receptors, respectively. Consecutive slides were used to analyze the relative intensities of multiple lipid species by MALDI Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) with microscopic anatomical resolution. The quantitative analysis of the astrocyte population was performed by immunohistochemistry. CB1 receptor activity was decreased in the amygdala and motor cortex of 3xTg-AD mice, but LPA1 activity was increased in the corpus callosum, motor cortex, hippocampal CA1 area, and striatum. Conversely, S1P1 activity was reduced in hippocampal areas. Moreover, the observed modifications on PC, PA, SM, and PI intensities in different brain areas depend on their fatty acid composition, including decrease of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) phospholipids and increase of species containing saturated fatty acids (SFA). The regulation of some lipid species in specific brain regions together with the modulation of the eCB, LPA, and S1P signaling in 3xTg-AD mice indicate a neuroprotective adaptation to improve neurotransmission, relieve the myelination dysfunction, and to attenuate astrocyte-mediated neuroinflammation. These results could contribute to identify new therapeutic strategies based on the regulation of the lipid signaling in familial AD patients.
