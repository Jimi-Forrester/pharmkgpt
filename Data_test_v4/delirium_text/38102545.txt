38102545|a|BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to examine the risk of fall with the surrogate outcome of the Aachen Falls Prevention Scale and to assess the clinical pharmacist interventions in order to minimize anticholinergic drug burden and associated risk of fall according to a fall risk assessment scale in the older adults. METHODS: Patients who admitted to the geriatric outpatient clinic of a university hospital and taking at least one anticholinergic drug were evaluated both retrospectively and prospectively as groups of different patients by the clinical pharmacist. Patients' anticholinergic burden was assessed using the Anticholinergic Cognitive Burden Scale. For fall risk assessment, the Aachen Falls Prevention Scale was also administered to each patient whose anticholinergic burden was determined in the prospective phase of the study. RESULTS: A total of 601 patients were included. Risk of falls increased 2.50 times in patients with high anticholinergic burden (OR (95% CI) = 2.503 (1.071-5.852); p = 0.034), and the existing history of falls increased the risk of high anticholinergic burden 2.02 times (OR (95%CI) = 2.026 (1.059-3.876); p = 0.033). In addition, each unit increase in the fall scale score in the prospective phase increased the risk of high anticholinergic burden by 22% (p = 0.028). Anticholinergic burden was significantly reduced as a result of interventions by the clinical pharmacist in the prospective phase (p = 0.010). CONCLUSION: Our study revealed that incorporating a clinical pharmacist in the handling of geriatric patients aids in the detection, reduction, and prevention of anticholinergic adverse effects.
