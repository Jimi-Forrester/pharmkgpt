39668706|a|OBJECTIVES: This study was conducted to determine the effect of Cognitive Stimulation Therapy (CST) on apathy, loneliness, anxiety, and activities of daily living of individuals with Alzheimer's disease. METHOD: The study was conducted in a daily care center between January 2023 and January 2024 in a randomized control study. A total of 52 people, 26 intervention and 26 control groups, were enrolled in the study and formed the sample of the study. Demographic Information Form, Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES-C), Geriatric Anxiety Scale (GAS), UCLA Loneliness Scale Short Form (UCLA-SF), and Functional Impairment in Dementia Scale (DAD) were used in the study. RESULTS: After the intervention, it was found that the intervention group's levels of apathy, loneliness and anxiety were significantly reduced compared to the control group. In the intra-group comparisons, it was found that there was a significant difference between the pre-test and post-test scores of the AES-C, UCLA-SF, GAS of the individuals in the intervention group after the application of CST, and between the pre-test and pre-test scores of the DAD (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: CST was found to be effective in reducing apathy, loneliness and anxiety levels and increasing daily living activities in older people with Alzheimer's disease.
