34840989|t|Short-Term Relocation Stress-Induced Hematological and Immunological Changes in Saimiri boliviensis boliviensis.
34840989|a|Nonhuman primates are frequently transported to a new location or temporarily relocated within their colony. Both transportation and relocation expose animals to new environments, causing them to undergo a stress response (before adapting). In our NHP colony, the mentioned situations are not infrequent for many reasons, including maintenance. The objective of this study was to determine whether abrupt changes consisting of relocation, housing, separation, and grouping could influence hematological and immunological parameters and thereby functional activity. The current study used squirrel monkeys as a model to investigate the stress-inducing effects of relocation within a facility, while animals acclimated to new situations (physical, housing). A detailed blood analysis revealed significant changes in lymphocytes, triglycerides, total protein, creatinine, and ALT. Flow cytometric analysis of peripheral blood showed reduction in CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T cells and monocytes, while B cells and natural killer (NK) cells changed with relocation. Simultaneously, changes in functional activity of immune cells altered proliferative responses and as shown by ELISpot (IFN gamma). Though the parameters studied are not affected as severely as those in animals transported by road or air, stress responses induced by intrafacility relocation are significant and worth consideration. Our findings indicate that squirrel monkeys mimic the features seen in humans exposed to social stressors and may serve an important model for understanding the mechanisms of stress-induced immune dysfunction in humans.
