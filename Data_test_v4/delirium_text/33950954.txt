33950954|a|BACKGROUND: Intravenous dexmedetomidine (DEX) has been used to prevent emergence agitation (EA) in children. The aim of this meta-analysis was to evaluate whether DEX decreases EA incidence without augmenting oculocardiac reflex (OCR) in pediatric patients undergoing strabismus surgery. METHODS: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wan Fang, and the Cochrane Library to collect the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the effects of intraoperative DEX in children undergoing strabismus surgery from inception to October 2019. Postoperative Pediatric Agitation and Emergence Delirium (PAED) score, postoperative EA, extubation or laryngeal mask airway (LMA) removal time, postanesthetic care unit (PACU) stay time, OCR, and postoperative vomiting (POV) were evaluated. RESULTS: 11 RCTs including 801 patients were included in this study. Compared with control group, intravenous DEX significantly reduced postoperative PAED score (WMD, 3.05; 95% CI: -3.82 to -2.27, P = .017) and incidences of postoperative EA 69% (RR, 0.31; 95% CI: 0.17 to 0.55, P < .00) and POV (RR, 0.28; 95% CI: 0.13 to 0.61, P = .001). Furthermore, the use of DEX significantly delayed extubation or LMA removal time (WMD, 2.11; 95% CI: 0.25 to 3.97, P < .001). No significant difference was found in the incidence of ORC and PACU stay time. CONCLUSION: Intravenous DEX reduced the incidences of EA without increasing OCR in pediatric patients undergoing strabismus surgery. Meanwhile, DEX infusion decreased the incidence of POV in children.
