25003699|t|Characterization of a brain permeant fluorescent molecule and visualization of Abeta parenchymal plaques, using real-time multiphoton imaging in transgenic mice.
25003699|a|Emerging paradigms mandate discovery of imaging agents for diagnosing Alzheimer's disease (AD) prior to appearance of clinical symptoms. To accomplish this objective, a novel heterocyclic molecule (4) was synthesized and validated as Abeta targeted probe. The agent shows labeling of numerous diffuse Abeta plaques in confirmed AD human brain tissues and traverses the blood-brain barrier to enable labeling of parenchymal Abeta plaques in live mice (APP(+-)/PS1(+-)) brains.
