38473986|a|Elderly human brains are vulnerable to multiple proteinopathies, although each protein has a different transmission pathway. Tau-immunoreactive astrocytes are well-known in elderly brains. In contrast, astrocytic plaques, a hallmark in corticobasal degeneration (CBD), rarely occur in aging and neurodegenerative disease other than CBD. To elucidate the clinicopathological correlation of aging-related pathology in CBD, we examined 21 pathologically proven CBD cases in our institute (12 males and 9 females, with a mean age of death 70.6 years). All CBD cases showed grains and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Fifteen cases (71.4%) showed beta-amyloid deposition such as senile plaques or cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Three cases (14.3%) had Lewy body pathology. One case was classified as amygdala-predominant Lewy body disease, although no cases met the pathological criteria for Alzheimer's disease. Five cases (23.8%) displayed Limbic-predominant and age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE). NFTs, grains, and TDP-43-positive neuronal inclusions were widely distributed throughout the limbic system of CBD patients, but their densities were low. CBD might a have similar cell vulnerability and transmission pathway to that of multiple proteinopathy in aging brains.
