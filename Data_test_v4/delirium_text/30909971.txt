30909971|a|It is now generally accepted that the extra-skeleton functionalities of bone are multifaceted. Its endocrine functions came first to light when it was realized that osteoblasts, the bone forming cells, maintain energy homeostasis by improving glucose metabolism, insulin sensitivity and energy expenditure through osteocalcin, a multipurpose osteokine secreted by osteoblasts. Recently, the emerging knowledge on the functional aspects of this osteokine expanded to properties including adult and maternal regulation of cognitive functions. Therapeutic potential of this osteokine has also been recently reported in experimental Parkinson's disease models. This review highlights such findings on the functions of osteocalcin in the brain and emphasizes on exploring and analyzing much more in-depth basic and clinical studies.
