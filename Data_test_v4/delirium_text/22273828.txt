22273828|a|CONTEXT: Postoperative nausea and vomiting remains a clinically important problem after strabismus surgery in children. OBJECTIVE: To study the benefit of adding midazolam to ramosetron on the incidence of postoperative nausea, retching or vomiting and on the incidence of postoperative agitation. DESIGN: A randomised, double-blind comparison. SETTING: The operating theatre suite and day care unit of Seoul National University Hospital. The study period was January to December 2010. PATIENTS: In total, 405 paediatric patients (aged 4-12 years) undergoing strabismus surgery were enrolled and randomly assigned to one of two groups, ramosetron or ramosetron with midazolam. INTERVENTION: Patients received either ramosetron 6 mug kg or ramosetron 6 mug kg and midazolam 0.1 mg kg prior to induction of anaesthesia. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The incidences of nausea, retching or vomiting in the first 48 h after surgery, and the incidence of emergence agitation in the post-anaesthetic care unit. RESULT: The incidences of nausea, retching or vomiting during the first and second 24-h periods after surgery were similar in the two groups. There was a small, clinically insignificant reduction in delirium scores in the ramosetron with midazolam group. CONCLUSION: Adding midazolam to ramosetron had no advantages over ramosetron alone in reducing the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting in children undergoing strabismus surgery.
