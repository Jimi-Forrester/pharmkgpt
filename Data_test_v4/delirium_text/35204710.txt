35204710|t|Posttranscriptional Regulation of Insulin Resistance: Implications for Metabolic Diseases.
35204710|a|Insulin resistance defines an impairment in the biologic response to insulin action in target tissues, primarily the liver, muscle, adipose tissue, and brain. Insulin resistance affects physiology in many ways, causing hyperglycemia, hypertension, dyslipidemia, visceral adiposity, hyperinsulinemia, elevated inflammatory markers, and endothelial dysfunction, and its persistence leads to the development metabolic disease, including diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular disease, or nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), as well as neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. In addition to classical transcriptional factors, posttranscriptional control of gene expression exerted by microRNAs and RNA-binding proteins constitutes a new level of regulation with important implications in metabolic homeostasis. In this review, we describe miRNAs and RBPs that control key genes involved in the insulin signaling pathway and related regulatory networks, and their impact on human metabolic diseases at the molecular level, as well as their potential use for diagnosis and future therapeutics.
