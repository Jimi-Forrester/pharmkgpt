36173931|t|Synthesis of a Systematic 64-Membered Heparan Sulfate Tetrasaccharide Library.
36173931|a|Heparan sulfate (HS) has multifaceted biological activities. To date, no libraries of HS oligosaccharides bearing systematically varied sulfation structures are available owing to the challenges in synthesizing a large number of HS oligosaccharides. To overcome the obstacles and expedite the synthesis, a divergent approach was designed, where 64 HS tetrasaccharides covering all possible structures of 2-O-, 6-O- and N-sulfation with the glucosamine-glucuronic acid-glucosamine-iduronic acid backbone were successfully produced from a single strategically protected tetrasaccharide intermediate. This extensive library helped identify the structural requirements for HS sequences to have strong fibroblast growth factor-2 binding but a weak affinity for platelet factor-4. Such a strategy to separate out these two interactions could lead to new HS-based potential therapeutics without the dangerous adverse effect of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.
