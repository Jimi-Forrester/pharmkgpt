39322063|a|OBJECTIVE: Remimazolam, a novel benzodiazepine, is widely used as an anesthetic in endoscopic procedures; however, its effects on cognitive function remain unclear, limiting its broader application in general anaesthesia. Neuroinflammation is a well-established key factor in the etiology and progression of cognitive dysfunction, including conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, postoperative delirium, and postoperative cognitive dysfunction. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that remimazolam exerts anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects, and clinical reports indicate a reduced incidence of postoperative delirium in patients treated with remimazolam. Nevertheless, whether remimazolam improves cognitive function through its anti-inflammatory properties remains uncertain. This study aimed to investigate the neuroprotective effects of remimazolam and its underlying mechanism in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced model of neuroinflammation, neuronal injury, and cognitive dysfunction METHODS: C57BL/6J male mice were administered LPS intraperitoneally to establish a model of neuroinflammation-induced cognitive impairment. A subset of mice received remimazolam via intraperitoneal injection 30minutes prior to LPS administration. Cognitive performance was evaluated using behavioural tests, including the Morris Water Maze (MWM), Novel Object Recognition (NOR) test, and Open Field Test (OFT). Hippocampal tissues were analyzed by haematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining to assess structural changes. Inflammatory markers, including Interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1beta, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, were quantified using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and real-time quantitative PCR. Immunofluorescence was used to detect translocator protein (TSPO) and markers of microglia activation (IBA-1, CD16/32, and CD206). RESULTS: (1) Remimazolam reversed LPS-induced cognitive deficits, as evidenced by shorter spatial exploration latency and increased platform crossings in the MWM, and an elevated recognition index in the NOR test. (2) Remimazolam improved hippocampal morphology, reducing LPS-induced neuronal damage. (3) Remimazolam significantly decreased levels of hippocampal inflammatory cytokines, inhibited microglial activation, promoted M2-type microglia polarization, and increased TSPO expression. CONCLUSION: Remimazolam demonstrated neuroprotective and anti-neuroinflammatory effects in a mouse model of LPS-induced cognitive impairment. These effects are likely mediated through the regulation of TSPO, which inhibits microglial activation and promotes the polarization of microglia from the pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype to the anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype.
