37034022|a|Survivors of prolonged intensive care unit (ICU) admissions may present undesirable long-term outcomes. In particular, physical impairment and cognitive dysfunction have both been described in patients surviving episodes requiring mechanical ventilation and sedation. One of the strategies to prevent the aforementioned outcomes involves the implementation of a bundle composed by: (1) Spontaneous awakening trial; (2) Spontaneous breathing trial; (3) Choosing proper sedation strategies; (4) Delirium detection and management; (5) Early ICU mobility; and (6) Family engagement (ABCDEF bundle). The components of this bundle contribute in shortening length of stay on mechanical ventilation and reducing incidence of delirium. Since the first description of the ABCDEF bundle, other relevant therapeutic factors have been proposed, such as introducing music therapy. This mini-review describes the current evidence supporting the use of the ABCDEF bundle, as well as current knowledge on the implementation of music therapy.
