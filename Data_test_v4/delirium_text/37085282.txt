37085282|t|Complex Lemierre syndrome with multisystemic abscesses.
37085282|a|We present here the challenging case of severe Lemierre syndrome in a healthy woman in her late twenties, whose clinical presentation was characterised by lung abscesses and disseminated systemic abscesses in the brain, the abdomen and the soft-tissues, as a likely consequence of a patent foramen ovale. Blood cultures were positive for Fusobacterium necrophorum and a right lingual vein thrombosis was detected at a late stage when the patient developed a septic shock. Initial antimicrobial therapy with metronidazole and ceftriaxone was modified to meropenem due to progressive worsening. The patient underwent laparoscopy and neurosurgical drainage of a cerebral abscess. She spent many days in the intensive care unit and recovered fully after 6 weeks on meropenem therapy. Although considered rare, the incidence of Lemierre syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, is increasing. The clinician should promptly recognise and treat it while being aware of its potential atypical presentations.
