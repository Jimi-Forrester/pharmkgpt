35540062|t|Metabolomics profiling of methamphetamine addicted human serum and three rat brain areas.
35540062|a|Methamphetamine (METH) has already been a serious problem all over the world. The identification of related biomarkers and pathways is helpful to evaluate the degree of METH addiction, develop appropriate treatment during abstinence, and explore the mechanism. Here, it is the first time to perform metabolomics profiling of METH addicted human serum and three regions of METH-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) rat brain by using UHPLC-MS/MS and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI), respectively. Untargeted metabolomics analysis demonstrated clear differences between METH abusers and the healthy control by finding 35 distinct expressed metabolites in serum, including 5 TCA intermediates, 17 amino acids and 13 other biomolecules, 15 of which were newly identified following METH exposure. By using MALDI-MSI, the relative quantification and distribution of 14 metabolites were investigated in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), dorsal hippocampus (dHPC) and ventral hippocampus (vHPC) of CPP rat brain. Taken together, METH addiction could influence energy metabolism, amino acids metabolism, and phospholipids metabolism. A multi-parameter model consisting of these related metabolites can be established as a METH addiction biomarker in the future. The mapping of phospholipids provided new insights into the mechanism of METH addiction. Notably, the trend of metabolite changes in NAc and dHPC was almost the same, while it was opposite between dHPC and vHPC. It seems that NAc and dHPC were the two regions more susceptible to METH administration in the brain. And dHPC and vHPC play different roles in METH addiction proved by metabolites mapping.
