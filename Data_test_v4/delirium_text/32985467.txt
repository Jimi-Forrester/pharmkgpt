32985467|a|Currently, ischemic stroke is the most prevalent form of stroke compared to hemorrhagic and there is a high incidence in older adults. Nutrition is a modifiable risk factor for stroke. B-vitamins are part of a metabolic network that integrates nutritional signals with biosynthesis, redox homeostasis, and epigenetics. These vitamins play an essential role in the regulation of cell proliferation, stress resistance, and embryo development. A deficiency in vitamin B12 is common in older adults and has been reported to be implicated in ischemic stroke. The aim of this review was to investigate whether vitamin B12 deficiencies impact the risk and outcome of ischemic stroke. Clinical data from our literature review strongly suggest that a deficiency in vitamin B12 is a risk factor for ischemic stroke and possible outcome. Our survey of the literature has identified that there is a gap in the understanding of the mechanisms through which a vitamin B12 deficiency leads to an increased risk of stroke and outcome. A vitamin B12 deficiency can increase homocysteine levels, which are a well-established risk factor for ischemic stroke. Another potential mechanism through which vitamin B12 deficient may impact neurological function and increase risk of stroke, is changes in myelination, however this link requires further investigation. Further studies are required in model systems to understand how a vitamin B12 deficiency changes the brain.
