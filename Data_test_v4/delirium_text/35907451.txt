Identifying targets for drug repurposing could be an effective means to present new and fast treatments. Furthermore, the risk of morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 goes up when there are coexisting medical conditions, however, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In the current study, we have adopted a network-based systems biology approach to investigate the RNA binding proteins (RBPs)-based molecular interplay between COVID-19, various human cancers, and neurological disorders. The network based on RBPs commonly involved in the three disease conditions consisted of nine RBPs connecting 10 different cancer types, 22 brain disorders, and COVID-19 infection, ultimately hinting at the comorbidities and complexity of COVID-19. Further, we underscored five miRNAs with reported antiviral properties that target all of the nine shared RBPs and are thus therapeutically valuable. As a strategy to improve the clinical conditions in comorbidities associated with COVID-19, we propose perturbing the shared RBPs by drug repurposing. The network-based analysis presented hereby contributes to a better knowledge of the molecular underpinnings of the comorbidities associated with COVID-19.
