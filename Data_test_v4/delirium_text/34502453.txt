34502453|a|Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) have an immunoregulatory capacity and have been used in different clinical protocols requiring control of the immune response. However, variable results have been obtained, mainly due to the effect of the microenvironment on the induction, increase, and maintenance of MSC immunoregulatory mechanisms. In addition, the importance of cell-cell contact for MSCs to efficiently modulate the immune response has recently been highlighted. Because these interactions would be difficult to achieve in the physiological context, the release of extracellular vesicles (EVs) and their participation as intermediaries of communication between MSCs and immune cells becomes relevant. Therefore, this article focuses on analyzing immunoregulatory mechanisms mediated by cell contact, highlighting the importance of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and the participation of EVs. Moreover, the effects of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), the main cytokines involved in MSC activation, are examined. These cytokines, when used at the appropriate concentrations and times, would promote increases in the expression of immunoregulatory molecules in the cell and allow the acquisition of EVs enriched with these molecules. The establishment of certain in vitro activation guidelines will facilitate the design of conditioning protocols to obtain functional MSCs or EVs in different pathophysiological conditions.
