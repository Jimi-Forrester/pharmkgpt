35421203|a|Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are double membrane structures released by all cell types with identified roles in the generation, transportation, and degradation of amyloid-beta protein (Abeta) oligomers in Alzheimer's disease (AD). EVs are thus increasingly recognized to play a neuroprotective role in AD, through their ability to counteract the neurotoxic effects of Abeta, possibly through interactions with specific receptors on cell membranes. Our previous studies have identified the amylin receptor (AMY), particularly AMY3 subtype, as a mediator of the deleterious actions of Abeta in vitro and in vivo experimental paradigms. In the present study, we demonstrate that AMY3 enriched EVs can bind soluble oligomers of Ass and protect N2a cells against toxic effects of this peptide. The effect was specific to amylin receptor as it was blocked in the presence of amylin receptor antagonist AC253. This notion was supported by reduced Abeta binding to EVs from AMY depleted mice compared to those from wild type (Wt) mice. Finally, application of AMY3, but not Wt derived, EVs to hippocampal brain slices improved Abeta-induced reduction of long-term potentiation, a cellular surrogate of memory. Collectively, our observations support the role of AMY receptors, particularly AMY3, in EVs as a potential therapeutic target for AD.
