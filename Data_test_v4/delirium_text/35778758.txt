35778758|t|Women's lifetime reproductive profiles and frailty among aging individuals in the USA and the Philippines.
35778758|a|Frailty, particularly traits which are related to sex steroid hormone production, results from the age-associated decline in function considered to be part of the typical aging process. This process may vary with influences including environmental, biological, or lifestyle factors. An area of concern that has received relatively little attention is the impact of cumulative lifetime changes in sex steroid hormones related to the traits we see that typify the human aging process. Women's lifetime reproductive profiles include menstrual/ovulatory cycles, gestation, and lactation, all of which respond to changes in sex steroid hormone levels. Here, we review data on reproductive profiles and risks of frailty among post-menopausal women. In the current study, our team collected reproductive histories of women to determine the estimated number of lifetime reproductive cycles (ELC). We interviewed 44 women in the USA and 67 women in the Philippines aged 65 years plus to obtain data on reproductive cycles, pregnancy, and breastfeeding. Participants completed several frailty tasks including grip strength, a sit-to-stand test, and gait speed. While ELC was not associated with frailty in the US population, higher ELC was associated with lower frailty among the Philippine population. The current study should be considered as an exploratory project investigating field-friendly methods to use when considering lifetime reproductive histories and the influence on the aging process.
