36181104|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer disease (AD) is a common cause of dementia, and there are still a lack of treatment options to reverse or prevent disease progression. Existing evidence shows that acupuncture has advantages in the treatment of AD, but whether the efficacy of acupuncture belongs to the placebo effect remains controversial, and there is no strict placebo-controlled clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of acupuncture combined with Western medicine in the treatment of AD. METHODS: This is a prospective randomized, a single-blind, sham-acupuncture controlled trial to study the clinical efficacy of acupuncture combined with Western medicine in the treatment of mild to moderate AD. Participants will be randomly divided into treatment and control groups. The treatment group using acupuncture combined with donepezil hydrochloride orally, and the control group using sham acupuncture combined with donepezil hydrochloride orally, followed up for 24 weeks after 24 weeks of continuous treatment. Outcome measures included: AD assessment scale-cognitive subscale, mini-mental state examination, activities of daily living, neuropsychiatric inventory questionnaire, serum superoxide dismutase, and homocysteine levels. Finally, SPASS 21.0 software was used for statistical analysis of the data. DISCUSSION: This study will evaluate the efficacy of acupuncture combined with Western medicine in improving cognitive function and activities of daily living in AD patients. The results of this study will verify whether the efficacy of acupuncture in the treatment of AD belongs to the placebo effect, which will also provide a reference for the clinical use of acupuncture combined with Western medicine in the treatment of AD. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The TCTR identification number is TCTR20220817004.
