38596290|a|Glioblastoma, the most common primary brain tumor, has a 6.8% survival rate 5 years post diagnosis. Our team developed an oncolytic adenovirus with an OX-40L expression cassette named Delta-24-RGDOX. While studies have revealed the interaction between the gut microbiota and immunotherapy agents, there are no studies linking the gut microbiota with viroimmunotherapy efficacy. We hypothesize that gut bacterial signatures will be associated with oncolytic viral therapy efficacy. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated the changes in gut microbiota in two mouse cohorts: (1) GSC-005 glioblastoma-bearing mice treated orally with indoximod, an immunotherapeutic agent, or with Delta-24-RGDOX by intratumoral injection and (2) a mouse cohort harboring GL261-5 tumors used to mechanistically evaluate the importance of CD4+ T cells in relation to viroimmunotherapy efficacy. Microbiota assessment indicated significant differences in the structure of the gut bacterial communities in viroimmunotherapy-treated animals with higher survival compared with control or indoximod-treated animals. Moreover, viroimmunotherapy-treated mice with prolonged survival had a higher abundance of Bifidobacterium. The CD4+ T cell depletion was associated with gut dysbiosis, lower mouse survival, and lower antitumor efficacy of the therapy. These findings suggest that microbiota modulation along the gut-glioma axis contributes to the clinical efficacy and patient survival of viroimmunotherapy treated animals.
