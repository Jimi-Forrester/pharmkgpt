31259307|t|Medial Temporal Lobe Disconnection and Hyperexcitability Across Alzheimer's Disease Stages.
31259307|a| The posteromedial cortex (PMC) and medial temporal lobes (MTL) are two brain regions particularly vulnerable in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We have reviewed the spatiotemporal patterns of amyloid-beta and tau accumulation, local MTL functional alterations and MTL-PMC network reconfiguration, and propose a model to relate these elements to each other. Functional and structural MTL-PMC disconnection happen concomitant with amyloid-beta plaques and neurofibrillary tau accumulation within these same regions. Ongoing disconnection is accompanied by dysfunctional intrinsic local MTL circuit hyperexcitability, which exacerbates across distinct clinical stages of AD. Our overarching model proposes a sequence of events relating the spatiotemporal patterns of amyloid-beta and tau accumulation to MTL-PMC disconnection and local MTL hyperexcitability. We hypothesize that cortical PMC amyloid-beta pathology induces long-range information processing deficits through functional and structural MTL-PMC dysconnectivity at early disease stages, which in turn drives local MTL circuit hyperexcitability. Intrinsic local MTL circuit hyperexcitability subsequently accelerates local age-related tau deposition, facilitating tau spread from the MTL to the PMC, eventually resulting in extensive structural degeneration of white and grey matter as the disease advances. We hope that the present model may inform future longitudinal studies needed to test the proposed sequence of events.
