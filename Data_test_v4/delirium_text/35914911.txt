35914911|a|INTRODUCTION: Postoperative delirium (POD) is a common and distressing complication after thoracic surgery. S-ketamine has neuroprotective properties as a dissociative anaesthetic. Emerging literature has indicated that S-ketamine can reduce cognitive impairment in patients with depression. However, the role of S-ketamine in preventing POD remains unknown. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the effect of intraoperative prophylactic S-ketamine compared with that of dexmedetomidine on the incidence of POD in elderly patients undergoing non-cardiac thoracic surgery. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This will be a randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, positive-controlled, non-inferiority trial that enrolled patients aged 60-90 years undergoing thoracic surgery. The patients will be randomly allocated in a ratio of 1:1:1 to S-ketamine, dexmedetomidine or normal saline placebo groups using computer-generated randomisation with a block size of six. The primary outcome will be the incidence of POD within 4 days after surgery and this will be assessed using a 3-Minute Diagnostic Confusion Assessment Method two times per day. The severity and duration of POD, the incidence of emergence delirium, postoperative pain, quality of sleep, cognitive function, and the plasma concentrations of acetylcholine, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, tumour necrosis factor-alpha and incidence of adverse events will be evaluated as secondary outcomes. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval has been obtained from the Institutional Review Board of the Cancer Hospital and the Institute of Guangzhou Medical University (ZN202119). At the end of the trial, we commit to making a public disclosure available, regardless of the outcome. The public disclosure will include a publication in an appropriate journal and an oral presentation at academic meetings. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ChiCTR2100052750 (NCT05242692).
