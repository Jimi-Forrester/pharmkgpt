36901048|t|Economic and Performance Evaluation of E-Health before and after the Pandemic Era: A Literature Review and Future Perspectives.
36901048|a|E-Health represents one of the pillars of the modern healthcare system and a strategy involving the use of digital and telemedicine tools to provide assistance to an increasing number of patients, reducing, at the same time, healthcare costs. Measuring and understanding the economic value and performance of e-Health tools is, therefore, essential to understanding the outcome and best uses of such technologies. The aim of this paper is to determine the most frequently used methods for measuring the economic value and the performance of services in the framework of e-Health, considering different pathologies. An in-depth analysis of 20 recent articles, rigorously selected from more than 5000 contributions, underlines a great interest from the clinical community in economic and performance-related topics. Several diseases are the object of detailed clinical trials and protocols, leading to various economic outcomes, especially in the COVID-19 post-pandemic era. Many e-Health tools are mentioned in the studies, especially those that appear more frequently in people's lives outside of the clinical setting, such as apps and web portals, which allow for clinicians to keep in contact with their patients. While such e-Health tools and programs are increasingly studied from practical perspectives, such as in the case of Virtual Hospital frameworks, there is a lack of consensus regarding the recommended models to map and report their economic outcomes and performance. More investigations and guidelines by scientific societies are advised to understand the potential and path of such an evolving and promising phenomenon.
