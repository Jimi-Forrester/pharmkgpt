39556214|t|Delirium after cardiac arrest: incidence, risk factors, and association with neurologic outcome-insights from the Freiburg Delirium Registry.
39556214|a|AIM: Delirium in patients treated in the intensive care unit (ICU) is linked to adverse outcome, according to previous observations. However, data on patients recovering after cardiac arrest are sparse. The aim of this study was to assess incidence, risk factors, and outcome of patients with delirium after cardiac arrest in the Freiburg Delirium Registry (FDR). METHODS: In this retrospective registry study, all patients after cardiac arrest treated in the Freiburg University Medical Center medical ICU between 08/2016 and 03/2021 were included. Delirium was diagnosed using the Nursing Delirium screening scale (NuDesc), assessed three times daily. Favorable neurological outcome was defined as cerebral performance category (CPC) score at ICU discharge <= 2. RESULTS: Two hundred seventeen patients were included and among them, delirium was detected in one hundred ninety-nine (91.7%) patients. Age was independently associated with the incidence of delirium (p = 0.003), and inversely associated with the number of delirium-free days (p < 0.001). Favorable neurological outcome was present in 145/199 (72.9%) with, and 17/18 (94.4%) patients without delirium (p = 0.048). While the incidence of delirium was not independently associated with a favorable neurologic outcome, the number of delirium-free days strongly predicted the primary endpoint [OR 2.14 (1.73-2.64), p > 0.001]. CONCLUSION: Delirium complicated the ICU course in almost all patients after cardiac arrest. The number of delirium-free days was associated with favorable outcome while incidence of delirium itself was not.
