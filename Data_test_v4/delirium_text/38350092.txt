38350092|a|ABSTRACT: We reported imaging findings with complex signs that were corresponded with both dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Alzheimer disease (AD) in the case of a 78-year-old woman. Initially suspected as DLB due to cognitive and movement issues, diagnostic support included the cingulate island sign on 18 F-FDG PET, positive 131 I-MIBG cardiac scintigraphy, and DAT PET. However, MRI indicated hippocampal atrophy, and 18 F-FDG PET showed hypometabolism in the medial temporal lobe, suggesting the possibility of concomitant AD. Subsequent detection of beta-amyloid pathology and tau accumulation in the brain further supported the concurrent presence of AD pathology.
