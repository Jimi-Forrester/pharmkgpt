35160110|t|The Hamburg Spondylodiscitis Assessment Score (HSAS) for Immediate Evaluation of Mortality Risk on Hospital Admission.
35160110|a|(1) Background: Patients with spondylodiscitis often present with unspecific and heterogeneous symptoms that delay diagnosis and inevitable therapeutic steps leading to increased mortality rates of up to 27%. A rapid initial triage is essential to identify patients at risk for a complicative disease course. We therefore aimed to develop a risk assessment score using fast available parameters to predict in-hospital mortality of patients admitted with spondylodiscitis. (2) Methods: A retrospective data analysis of 307 patients with spondylodiscitis recruited from 2013 to 2020 was carried out. Patients were grouped according to all-cause mortality. Via logistic regression, individual patient and clinical characteristics predictive of mortality were identified. A weighted sum score to estimate a patient's risk of mortality was developed and validated in a randomly selected subgroup of spondylodiscitis patients. (3) Results: 14% of patients with spondylodiscitis died during their in-hospital stay at a tertiary center for spinal surgery. Univariate and logistic regression analyses of parameters recorded at hospital admission showed that age older than 72.5 years, rheumatoid arthritis, creatinine > 1.29 mg/dL and CRP > 140.5 mg/L increased the risk of mortality 3.9-fold, 9.4-fold, 4.3-fold and 4.1-fold, respectively. S. aureus detection increased the risk of mortality by 2.3-fold. (4) Conclusions: The novel Hamburg Spondylodiscitis Assessment Score (HSAS) shows a good fit identifying patients at low-, moderate-, high- and very high risk for in hospital mortality on admission (AUC: 0.795; p < 0.001). The implementation of the HSAS into clinical practice could ease identification of high-risk patients using readily available parameters alone, improving the patient's safety and outcome.
