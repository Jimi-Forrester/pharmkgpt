37124926|a|Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) and cancer share proteins, pathways, and mutations. Their clinical symptoms are different. However, individuals with NDDs have higher probabilities of eventually developing cancer. Here, we review the literature and ask how the shared features can lead to different medical conditions and why having an NDD first can increase the chances of malignancy. To explore these vital questions, we focus on dysregulated PI3K/mTOR, a major brain cell growth pathway in differentiation, and MAPK, a critical pathway in proliferation, a hallmark of cancer. Differentiation is governed by chromatin organization, making aberrant chromatin remodelers highly likely agents in NDDs. Dysregulated chromatin organization and accessibility influence the lineage of specific cell brain types at specific embryonic development stages. PAK1, with pivotal roles in brain development and in cancer, also regulates MAPK. We review, clarify, and connect dysregulated pathways with dysregulated proliferation and differentiation in cancer and NDDs and highlight PAK1 role in brain development and MAPK regulation. Exactly how PAK1 activation controls brain development, and why specific chromatin remodeler components, e.g., BAF170 encoded by SMARCC2 in autism, await clarification.
