24667382|t|Is adequate pain relief and time to analgesia associated with emergency department length of stay? A retrospective study.
24667382|a|OBJECTIVES: Evaluate the association of adequate analgesia and time to analgesia with emergency department (ED) length of stay (LOS). SETTING AND DESIGN: Post hoc analysis of real-time archived data. PARTICIPANTS: We included all consecutive ED patients >=18 years with pain intensity >6 (verbal numerical scale from 0 to 10), assigned to an ED bed, and whose pain was re-evaluated less than 1 h after receiving analgesic treatment. OUTCOME MEASURES: The main outcome was ED-LOS in patients who had adequate pain relief (AR= 50% pain intensity) compared with those who did not have such relief (NR). RESULTS: A total of 2033 patients (mean age 49.5 years; 51% men) met our inclusion criteria; 58.3% were discharged, and 41.7% were admitted. Among patients discharged or admitted, there was no significant difference in ED-LOS between those with AR (median (25th-75th centile): 9.6 h (6.3-14.8) and 18.2 h (11.6-25.7), respectively) and NR (median (25th-75th centile): 9.6 h (6.6-16.0) and 17.4 h (11.3-26.5), respectively). After controlling for confounding factors, rapid time to analgesia (not AR) was associated with shorter ED-LOS of discharged and admitted patients (p<0.001 and <0.05, respectively). When adjusting for confounding variables, ED-LOS is shortened by 2 h (95% CI 1.1 to 2.8) when delay to receive analgesic is <90 min compared with >90 min for discharged and by 2.3 h (95% CI 0.17 to 4.4) for admitted patients. CONCLUSIONS: In our study, AR was not linked with short ED-LOS. However, rapid administration of analgesia was associated with short ED-LOS.
