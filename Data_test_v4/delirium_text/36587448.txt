Therefore, this study aimed to investigate whether anti-ulcer drugs increase delirium risk. METHOD: Data were obtained from the medical records of patients admitted to a hospital due to trauma. We compared the incidence of delirium in patients who received H2RAs and PPIs with that in patients who received no anti-ulcer drugs. RESULTS: A total of 150, 158, and 238 patients received H2RAs, PPIs, and no anti-ulcer drugs, respectively. Delirium incidence was significantly higher in patients who received H2RAs (34.0%) and PPIs (44.9%) than in those who did not receive anti-ulcer drugs (22.3%). Even after adjustment for possible confounding factors, the association between H2RAs and delirium remained (adjusted OR 1.78; 95% CI 1.04-3.05), but that between PPIs and delirium was attenuated (adjusted OR 1.25; 95% CI 0.71-2.23). CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that H2RAs are associated with delirium risk. We replicated findings of a previous data-driven study. Clinicians need to consider the effect of delirium in anti-ulcer drug selection.
