Because the gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) ligand bindings vary with age, the objective was to investigate the agreement between visual reads of 11C- and 18F-PET scans. METHODS: Cognitively unimpaired (CU) younger adults (N = 30; 39.5 +- 6.0 years), CU older adults (N = 30; 68.6 +- 5.9 years), and adults with AD (N = 22; 67.0 +- 8.5 years) underwent brain MRI, 11C-Pittsburgh compound-B (PiB)-PET, and 18F-flutemetamol-PET. Amyloid-beta deposition was assessed visually by two nuclear medicine specialists on 11C-PiB-PET and 18F-flutemetamol-PET, and quantitatively by PET centiloids. RESULTS: Seventy-two 11C-PiB-PET and 18F-flutemetamol-PET visual reads were concordant. However, 1 18F-flutemetamol-PET and 9 11C-PiB-PET were discordant with quantitative values. In four additional cases, while 11C-PiB-PET and 18F-flutemetamol-PET visual reads were concordant, both were discordant with quantitative values. Disagreements in CU younger adults were only with 11C-PiB-PET visual reads. The remaining disagreements were with CU older adults. CONCLUSION: Age, GM/WM binding, amyloid-beta load, and disease severity may affect visual assessments of PET ligands. Increase in WM binding with age causes a loss of contrast between GM and WM on 11C-PiB-PET, particularly in CU younger adults, leading to false positivity. In CU older adults, increased WM signal may bleed more into cortical regions, hiding subtle cortical uptake, especially with 18F-flutemetamol, whereas 11C-PiB can detect true regional positivity. Understanding these differences will improve patient care and treatment evaluation in clinic and clinical trials.
