22058940|t|(E)-2-(4-Bromo-benzyl-idene)indan-1-one.
22058940|a|In the title compound, C(16)H(11)BrO, the dihydro-indene ring system is approximately planar, with a maximum deviation of 0.008 (2) A. The mean plane of this ring system forms a dihedral angle of 3.73 (11) , with the bromo-substituted benzene ring. In the crystal, weak inter-molecular C-H O hydrogen bonds link the mol-ecules into sheets parallel to the ab plane and further stabilization is provided by weak C-H pi inter-actions involving the bromo-substituted benzene rings.
