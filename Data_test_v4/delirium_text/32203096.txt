32203096|a|Aging, which is associated with age-related changes in physiological processes, is the most significant risk factor for the development and progression of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Accumulating evidence has indicated that sphingolipids are significant regulators that are associated with pathogenesis in aging and several age-related neurodegenerative diseases. In particular, abnormal levels of acid sphingomyelinase (ASM), one of the significant sphingolipid-metabolizing enzymes, have been found in the blood and some tissues under various neuropathological conditions. Moreover, recent studies have reported the importance of ASM as a critical mediator that contributes to pathologies in aging and age-related neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we describe the pathophysiological processes that are regulated by ASM, focusing on the age-related neurodegenerative environment. Furthermore, we discuss novel insights into how new therapeutics targeting ASM may potentially lead to effective strategies to combat aging and age-related neurodegenerative diseases.
