39861188|a|Peptide-loaded poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) nanocarriers represent a transformative approach to addressing the challenges of peptide-based therapies. These systems offer solutions to peptide instability, enzymatic degradation, and limited bioavailability by providing controlled release, targeted delivery, and improved stability. The versatility of PLGA nanocarriers extends across therapeutic domains, including cancer therapy, neurodegenerative diseases, vaccine development, and regenerative medicine. Innovations in polymer chemistry, surface functionalization, and advanced manufacturing techniques, such as microfluidics and electrospraying, have further enhanced the efficacy and scalability of these systems. This review highlights the key physicochemical properties, preparation strategies, and proven benefits of peptide-loaded PLGA systems, emphasizing their role in sustained drug release, immune activation, and tissue regeneration. Despite remarkable progress, challenges such as production scalability, cost, and regulatory hurdles remain.
