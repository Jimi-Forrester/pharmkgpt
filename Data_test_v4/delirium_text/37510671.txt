37510671|t|Performing Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) across Borders: Midterm Follow-Up of the Aeromedical Evacuation after Civilian Bus Accident at Madeira.
37510671|a|On 17 April 2019, a coach with tourists from Germany crashed in Madeira, requiring repatriation by the German Air Force. The Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) concept was the central component of patient care. Data in Madeira were collected through a structured interview. The analysis of the Aeromedical Evacuation was based on intensive care transport records. In Germany, all available medical data sheets were reviewed for data collection. Quality of life (HRQoL) was evaluated by the 12-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12). Twenty-eight prehospital patients were transported to the Level III Trauma Center in Funchal (Madeira). Five operative procedures were performed. Fifteen patients were eligible for Aeromedical Evacuation (AE). In the second hospital phase in Germany, in total 82 radiological images and 9 operations were performed. Hospital stay lasted 11 days (median, IQR 10-18). Median follow-up (14 of 15 patients) was 16 months (IQR 16-21). Eighty percent (8 out of 10) showed an increased risk for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Six key findings were identified in this study: divergent injury classification, impact of AE mission on health status, lack of communication, need of PTSD prophylaxis, patient identification, and media coverage. Those findings may improve AE missions in the future, e.g., when required after armed conflicts.
