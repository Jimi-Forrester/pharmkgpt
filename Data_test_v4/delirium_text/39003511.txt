39003511|a|Treatment of patients with advanced heart failure (HF) with the use of left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) improves the quality of life and the length of survival. Despite the undeniable benefits associated with improved physical performance, as a result of the decrease of the underlying disease symptoms, it carries the risk of complications in the area of the patient's somatic and psychological status. Long-term circulatory failure can contribute to a weakening of the adaptative mechanism and consequently lead to a variety of emotional disruptions. Patients must face the fear of imminent physical, family, and social changes that LVAD requires. They may experience sleep disorders, mood disorders, anxiety disorders, and in the early postoperative period also disorders of consciousness with a pattern of delirium. For this reason, it is advisable to provide multidisciplinary medical care for the patient at all stages of treatment, including regular monitoring of general health and mental health. This article presents risk factors for psychiatric disorders in patients with LVADs and ways of pharmacological and non-pharmacological management when these factors are identified and disorders are diagnosed.
