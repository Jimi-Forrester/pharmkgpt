29060285|a|The classification of neuroimaging data for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is one of the main research goals of the neuroscience and clinical fields. In this study, we performed extreme learning machine (ELM) classifier to discriminate the AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from normal control (NC). We compared the performance of ELM with that of a linear kernel support vector machine (SVM) for 718 structural MRI images from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. The data consisted of normal control, MCI converter (MCI-C), MCI non-converter (MCI-NC), and AD. We employed SVM-based recursive feature elimination (RFE-SVM) algorithm to find the optimal subset of features. In this study, we found that the RFE-SVM feature selection approach in combination with ELM shows the superior classification accuracy to that of linear kernel SVM for structural T1 MRI data.
