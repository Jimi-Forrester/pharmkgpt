35836233|a|The incidence of repetitive mild traumatic brain injury (rmTBI), one of the main risk factors for predicting neurodegenerative disorders, is increasing; however, its underlying mechanism remains unclear. As suggested by several studies, ferroptosis is possibly related to TBI pathophysiology, but its effect on rmTBI is rarely studied. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), the most studied experimental cells in stem cell therapy, exert many beneficial effects on diseases of the central nervous system, yet evidence regarding the role of MSCs in ferroptosis and post-rmTBI neurodegeneration is unavailable. Our study showed that rmTBI resulted in time-dependent alterations in ferroptosis-related biomarker levels, such as abnormal iron metabolism, glutathione peroxidase (GPx) inactivation, decrease in GPx4 levels, and increase in lipid peroxidation. Furthermore, MSC treatment markedly decreased the aforementioned rmTBI-mediated alterations, neuronal damage, pathological protein deposition, and improved cognitive function compared with vehicle control. Similarly, liproxstatin-1, a ferroptosis inhibitor, showed similar effects. Collectively, based on the above observations, MSCs ameliorate cognitive impairment following rmTBI, partially via suppressing ferroptosis, which could be a therapeutic target for rmTBI.
