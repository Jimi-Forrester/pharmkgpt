28638193|t|A Comparison Study of Quetiapine and Risperidone's Effectiveness and Safety on Treating Alcohol-induced Mental Disorder.
28638193|a|BACKGROUND: Compared with Risperidone, Quetiapine's effectiveness and safety on treating alcohol-induced mental disorder is still unclear. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical effectiveness and safety of Quetiapine on treating alcohol-induced mental disorder. METHODS: One hundred and forty-eight patients with alcohol-induced mental disorder were divided into the experimental group (75 patients) and the control group (73 patients) by the treatments they received. The patients in the experimental group were treated with Quetiapine by taking it three times per day orally. The mean (sd) maintenance dose was 151.2(27.3) mg/d, and the treatment cycle was 6 weeks. Patients in the control group received Risperidone once per day orally with a mean (sd) maintenance dose being 2.3(0.9) mg/d, and the treatment cycle was 6 weeks as well. The PANSS scale was used to assess patients' before and after treatment. The researchers also observed any adverse reactions in both treatment strategies and evaluated the effectiveness and safety of both treatment strategies. RESULTS: The mean (sd) PANSS scale score of the experimental group after two weeks of treatment was 71.9 (10.2), which was clearly better than the mean (sd) score before treatment (82.6 [11.4]), and was significantly better than the control group's mean (sd) score after two weeks (76.5[12.8]). Also, the experimental group's scores after 4 weeks of treatment and 6 weeks of treatment were significantly better than the control group. The experimental group's efficacy rate (94.7%) was higher than the control group's (90.4%); the cure rate of the experimental group (33.3%) was higher than that of the control group (24.7%), and the difference was statistically significant. The rates of adverse reactions in the experimental and control groups were 13.3% and 19.2% respectively, and they were significantly different from each other. CONCLUSION: Treating alcohol-induced mental disorder with Quetiapine is more effective than treating it with Risperidone. Quetiapine can improve patients' symptoms quickly, and lower the chance of adverse reactions. It is effective and safe.
