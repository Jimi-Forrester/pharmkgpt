29426925|t|Ageing potentiates diet-induced glucose intolerance, beta-cell failure and tissue inflammation through TLR4.
29426925|a|Ageing and obesity are two major risk factors for the development of type 2 diabetes (T2D). A chronic, low-grade, sterile inflammation contributes to insulin resistance and beta-cell failure. Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) is a major pro-inflammatory pathway; its ligands as well as downstream signals are increased systemically in patients with T2D and at-risk individuals. In the present study we investigated the combined effects of high fat/high sucrose diet (HFD) feeding, ageing and TLR4-deficiency on tissue inflammation, insulin resistance and beta-cell failure. In young mice, a short-term HFD resulted in a mildly impaired glucose tolerance and reduced insulin secretion, together with a beta-cell mass compensation. In older mice, HFD further deteriorated insulin secretion and induced a significantly impaired glucose tolerance and augmented tissue inflammation in adipose, liver and pancreatic islets, all of which was attenuated by TLR4 deficiency. Our results show that ageing exacerbates HFD-induced impairment of glucose homeostasis and pancreatic beta-cell function and survival, and deteriorates HFD-induced induction of mRNA expression of inflammatory cytokines and pro-inflammatory macrophage markers. TLR4-deficiency protects against these combined deleterious effects of a high fat diet and ageing through a reduced expression of inflammatory products in both insulin sensitive tissues and pancreatic islets.
