22420626|t|Design of beta-amyloid aggregation inhibitors from a predicted structural motif.
22420626|a|Drug design studies targeting one of the primary toxic agents in Alzheimer's disease, soluble oligomers of amyloid beta-protein (Abeta), have been complicated by the rapid, heterogeneous aggregation of Abeta and the resulting difficulty to structurally characterize the peptide. To address this, we have developed [Nle(35), D-Pro(37)]Abeta(42), a substituted peptide inspired from molecular dynamics simulations which forms structures stable enough to be analyzed by NMR. We report herein that [Nle(35), D-Pro(37)]Abeta(42) stabilizes the trimer and prevents mature fibril and beta-sheet formation. Further, [Nle(35), D-Pro(37)]Abeta(42) interacts with WT Abeta(42) and reduces aggregation levels and fibril formation in mixtures. Using ligand-based drug design based on [Nle(35), D-Pro(37)]Abeta(42), a lead compound was identified with effects on inhibition similar to the peptide. The ability of [Nle(35), D-Pro(37)]Abeta(42) and the compound to inhibit the aggregation of Abeta(42) provides a novel tool to study the structure of Abeta oligomers. More broadly, our data demonstrate how molecular dynamics simulation can guide experiment for further research into AD.
