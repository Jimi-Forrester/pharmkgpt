1799129|t|[Pathogeny of paranoid delirium].
1799129|a|Revisiting the old discussion on the intellectual, or emotional genesis of non-hallucinatory delusions, the author collects the opinion of classical authors on this essential subject of Psychiatry. Based on Kraepelin's description of the constitutive elements of paranoiac delusion, and relating such descriptions to the current advances in Neurobiology--especially Goldar's, on the participation of the limbic brain to the dynamics of personality--the author discusses his position regarding delirious verbal performances, and intends a subdivision of such disorders according to their own pathogenesis.
