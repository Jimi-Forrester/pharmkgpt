37110485|a|Endophytic fungi are a highly unpredictable group of microorganisms that can create a diverse range of secondary metabolites with biological activity. These metabolites enhance the host's ability to tolerate stress caused by various factors, such as disease, insects, pathogens, and herbivores. The secondary metabolites produced by endophytic fungi may have potential applications in agriculture, pharmacy, and medicine. The purpose of this study was to examine the anti-acetylcholinesterase activity of secondary metabolites extracted from endophytic fungi. Aspergillus versicolor SB5 was one of the many endophytic fungi isolated from Juncus rigidus and identified genetically with accession number ON872302. Our study utilized fermentation and microbial cultivation techniques to obtain secondary metabolites. During the course of our investigation, we isolated a compound called Physcion (C1) from the endophytic fungus Aspergillus versicolor SB5. We subsequently identified that C1 possesses inhibitory activity against COX-2 and LOX-1, with IC50 values of 43.10 and 17.54 microg/mL, respectively, making it an effective anti-inflammatory agent. Moreover, we found that C1 also exhibited potent anticholinesterase activity (86.9 +- 1.21%). In addition to these promising therapeutic properties, our experiments demonstrated that C1 possesses strong antioxidant capacity, as evidenced by its ability to scavenge DPPH, ABTS, O2 radicals, and NO and inhibit lipid peroxidation. To further investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying C1 pharmacological properties, we employed SwissADME web tools to predict the compound's ADME-related physicochemical properties and used Molecular Operating Environment and PyMOL for molecular docking studies.
