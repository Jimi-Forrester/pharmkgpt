39420317|a|BACKGROUND: Normal cells express functional tumor suppressor WW domain-containing oxidoreductase (WWOX), designated WWOXf. UV irradiation induces WWOXf cells to undergo bubbling cell death (BCD) - an event due to the accumulation of nuclear nitric oxide (NO) gas that forcefully pushes the nuclear and cell membranes to form one or two bubbles at room temperature (22  C) and below. In contrast, when WWOX-deficient or -dysfunctional (WWOXd) cells are exposed to UV and/or cold shock, the cells undergo nuclear pop-out explosion death (POD). We aimed to determine the morphological and biochemical changes in WWOXf cells during BCD versus apoptosis. METHODS: WWOXf and WWOXd cells were exposed to UV followed by measuring BCD or POD by time-lapse microscopy and/or time-lapse holographic microscopy at 4, 22, or 37  C to visualize morphological changes. Live cell stains were used to measure the kinetics of nitric oxide (NO) production and Ca2+ influx. Extent of cell death was measured by uptake of propidium iodide and by internucleosomal DNA fragmentation using agarose gel electrophoresis. RESULTS: WWOXf cells were exposed to UV and then cold shock, or cold shock and then UV, and cultured at 4, 10, and 22  C, respectively. Initially, UV induced calcium influx and NO production, which led to nuclear bubbling and final death. Cold shock pretreatment completely suppressed UV-mediated bubbling at 37  C, so the UV/cold shock-treated cells underwent apoptosis. Without cold shock, UV only induced bubbling at all temperatures, whereas the efficiency of bubbling at 37  C was reduced by greater than 50%. Morphologically, the WWOXf cell height or thickness was significantly increased during cell division or apoptosis, but the event did not occur in BCD. In comparison, when WWOXd cancer cells received UV or UV/cold shock, these cells underwent NO-independent POD. UV/cold shock effectively downregulated the expression of many proteins such as the housekeeping alpha-tubulin (> 70%) and beta-actin (< 50%), and cortactin (> 70%) in WWOXf COS7 cells. UV/cold shock induced relocation of alpha-tubulin to the nucleus and nuclear bubbles in damaged cells. UV induced co-translocation of the WWOX/TRAF2 complex to the nuclei, in which the prosurvival TRAF2 blocked the proapoptotic WWOX via its zinc finger domain. Without WWOX, TRAF2 did not relocate to the nuclei. Cold shock caused the dissociation of the WWOX/TRAF2 complex in the nucleus needed for BCD. In contrast, the formation of the WWOX/TRAF2 complex, plus p53, was strengthened at 37  C required for apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: The temperature-sensitive nuclear WWOX/TRAF2 complex acts as a molecular switch, whose dissociation favors BCD at low temperatures, and the association supports apoptosis at 37  C in UV-treated WWOXf cells.
