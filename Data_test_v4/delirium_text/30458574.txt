30458574|a|The upcoming and ongoing debate on neurotoxicity of anesthetics at a young age put a new spotlight on the emergence delirium of children (paedED). The European Society for Anesthesiology published a consensus guideline on prevention and therapy in 2017 which can be a useful guidance in daily clinical practice. Patient data management systems with their clear documentation concerning pain/therapy of pain and paedED will be valuable tools in order to assess the real incidence of paedED. Differentiating between pain/agitation and paedED migth not always be easy. Age-adapted scores should always be applied. Main focus in the prevention of paedED is the reduction of anxiety. The way this is achieved by the dedicated pediatric anesthesia teams caring for children, e.g. by oral midazolam, clowns, music, smartphone induction, does not matter. Using alpha2-agonists in the perioperative phase and applying propofol seems to be effective. A quiet supportive environment for recovery adds to a relaxed, stress-free awakening. For the future detecting paedED on normal wards becomes an important issue. This may be achieved by structured interviews or questionnaires assessing postoperative negative behavioural changes at the same time.
