34402286|t|[An integrative metabolomics and network pharmacology method for exploring bioactive components and preliminary pharmacodynamics in medicinal parts of Harrisonia perforata].
34402286|a|In this paper,metabolomics and network pharmacology were used to investigate the bioactive components of Harrisonia perforata and their possible mechanisms of action. Metabolites in the flowers,fruits,branches,leaves and stalks of H. perforata were analyzed by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Meanwhile,multiple statistical analysis methods including principal component analysis( PCA) and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis( OPLS-DA)were applied to screen and identify differential compounds. With metabolomics method,9 differential compounds were preliminarily identified from leaves and other non-traditional medicinal parts. Subsequently,these compounds were explored by using network pharmacology. With gastrointestinal absorption and drug-likeness as limiting conditions,they were imported into the Swiss ADME,from which 7 compounds with potential medicinal activity were obtained. Then,their targets were predicted by PharmMapper,with Human Protein Targets Only and Normalized Fit Score>0. 9 set as limiting conditions,and 60 standardized potential targets were identified with Uniprot. KEGG( Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes) pathway data was obtained using metascape and the &quot; potential active ingredients-target-pathway&quot; network was constructed with Cytoscape 3. 7. 2. The enrichment analysis of KEGG demonstrated that the 60 targets were enriched in 78 signaling pathways( min overlap: 3,P value cutoff: 0. 01,min enrichment: 1. 5),many of which are related to anti-bacteria,anti-inflammation and anti-virus,such as IL-17 signaling pathway,RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway and NOD-like receptor signaling pathway. Finally,depending on the clinical activity of H. perforata,the relevant signaling pathways were analyzed through experimental data and literature. Dehydroconiferyl alcohol was reported to have the anti-inflammatory effect and perforamone D to possess the antimycobacterial activity. The KEGG pathway enrichment analysis showed that dehydroconiferyl alcohol could act on the Alzheimer&apos;s disease( AD) signaling pathway by targeting CDK5 R1 and BACE1. ACh E inhibitor is the most promising drug to treat AD,while dehydroconiferyl alcohol has been proved to inhibit ACh E according to literature. The experimental results revealed that the extract of leaves of H. perforata can effectively inhibit the growth of Staphylococcus aureus. These are consistent with the enrichment analysis results of KEGG. This study explored the bioactive components and pharmacodynamics of the leaves of the H. perforata,laying a theoretical foundation for its in-depth development and rational application.
