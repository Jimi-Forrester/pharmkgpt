7941776|t|[Neuropeptide Y: psychopharmacological and clinical aspects].
7941776|a|Neuropeptide Y is a 36-amino acid peptide that is widely distributed in the brain. Recently, three neuropeptide Y receptor subtypes were discovered with the aid of peptidergic agonist analogs of neuropeptide Y. Many researchers reported that neuropeptide Y might be involved in locomotor activity, eating behavior, stress responses, memory processing, circadian rhythms, blood pressure and neuroendocrine functions. It was also reported to interact with sigma receptor and corticotropin-releasing factor. Clinical evidence suggests that neuropeptide Y might be related to depression, schizophrenia, anorexia nervosa and Alzheimer's disease. In this review, central distribution and receptor subtypes of neuropeptide Y, its physiological action and its levels in cerebrospinal fluid and plasma in psychiatric and neurological illnesses are described.
