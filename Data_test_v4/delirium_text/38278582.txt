38278582|t|Perioperative Evaluation of Brain Health.
38278582|a|As the global population is aging and surgical needs rise, the occurrence of perioperative neurocognitive disorders (PND) is becoming a significant concern. PND refers to cognitive changes that occur before or after surgery, including neurocognitive disorders, postoperative delirium, and delayed neurocognitive recovery. To address this issue, a brain health assessment initiative within a multidisciplinary team is an emerging concept. Assessing cognitive function, comorbidities, severity of neurocognitive disorders, medications, nutritional status, sleep quality, and other factors can help mitigate the risk of PND and improve patient outcomes.
