24271254|a|About 10 % of community dwelling elderly people are chronically consuming benzodiazepines. This proportion rises to 30 % in nursing homes or hospitals. Particularly in older patients, this usage leads to a higher risk of adverse drug reactions. Exposure contributes to delirium and falls with subsequent femoral neck fractures. The WHO has classified the risk potential of the new z-drugs to be the same as that associated with benzodiazepines. It is recommended that benzodiazepines should be discontinued step by step under supervision of a doctor or the dosage should be reduced.
