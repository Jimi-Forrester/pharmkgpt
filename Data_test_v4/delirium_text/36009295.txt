36009295|t|Synthesis and Antioxidant Properties of HeteroBisNitrones Derived from Benzene Dicarbaldehydes.
36009295|a|We report herein the synthesis and antioxidant profile of nine novel heterobisnitrones (hBNs) as new alpha-phenyl-tert-butylnitrone (PBN) analogues. The synthesized hBNs 1-9 were evaluated for their antioxidant activity using different in vitro techniques, while they were also tested as inhibitors of soybean LOX, as an indication of their anti-inflammatory effect. Nitrone hBN9 is the most potent antioxidant presenting higher anti-lipid peroxidation and hydroxyl radicals scavenging activities as well as higher lipoxygenase inhibition. In silico calculations reveal that hBN9 follows Lipinski's rule of five and that the molecule is able to penetrate theoretically the brain. All these results led us to propose hBN9 as a new potent antioxidant nitrone.
