35955978|t|Lipid Profile, Lp(a) Levels, and HDL Quality in Adolescents with Down Syndrome.
35955978|a|The improvement in the lifespan of individuals with Down syndrome (DS) has created interest in the context of the development of age-related diseases. Among them is atherosclerosis-based cardiovascular disease (CVD), which seems to be an especially urgent and important issue. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the lipid markers that may clarify cardiovascular risk profiles in individuals with DS. To this end, we analyzed lipid profile parameters, including lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) levels, protein composition, and the antioxidative properties of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), in 47 adolescents with DS and 47 individuals without DS. Compared with the control group (C), subjects with DS had significantly increased concentrations of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (105 +- 31 vs. 90 +- 24 mg/dL, p = 0.014), non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (120 +- 32 vs. 103 +- 26 mg/dL, p = 0.006), and triglycerides (72 [55-97] vs. 60 [50-77] mg/dL, p = 0.048). We found that patients with DS were characterized by significantly higher Lp(a) levels (31.9 [21.5-54.3] vs. 5.2 (2.4-16.1) mg/dL, p < 0.001). In fact, 57% of individuals with DS had Lp(a) levels above 30 mg/dL, which was approximately four times higher than those in the control group (DS 57% vs. C 15%). Apart from decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in the subjects with DS (53 +- 11 vs. 63 +- 12 mg/dL, p < 0.001), differences in parameters showing the quality of HDL particles were observed. The concentrations of the main proteins characterizing the HDL fraction, apolipoprotein A-I and apolipoprotein A-II, were significantly lower in the DS group (144 +- 21 vs. 181 +- 33 mg/dL, p < 0.001; 33 +- 6 vs. 39 +- 6 mg/dL, p < 0.001, respectively). No significant differences between the groups were observed for the concentration of paraoxonase-1 (DS 779 +- 171 vs. C 657 +- 340 ng/mL, p = 0.063), enzyme activities toward paraoxon (DS 219 [129-286] vs. C 168 [114-272] IU/L, p = 0.949), or phenyl acetate (DS 101 +- 20 vs. C 93 +- 21 kIU/L, p = 0.068). There were no differences in myeloperoxidase activity between the study groups (DS 327 [300-534] vs. C 426 [358-533] ng/mL, p = 0.272). Our results are the first to demonstrate an unfavorable lipid profile combined with higher Lp(a) levels and quality changes in HDL particles in individuals with DS. This sheds new light on cardiovascular risk and traditional healthcare planning for adolescents with DS.
