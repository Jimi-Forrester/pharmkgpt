12067484|t|Apolipoprotein E: a major piece in the Alzheimer's disease puzzle.
12067484|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder with multiple etiologies. The presence of the E4 isoform of apolipoprotein E (apoE) has been shown to increase the risk and to decrease the age of onset for AD and is the major susceptibility factor known for the disease. ApoE4 has been shown to intensify all the biochemical disturbances characteristic of AD, including beta amyloid (Abeta) deposition, tangle formation, neuronal cell death, oxidative stress, synaptic plasticity and dysfunctions of lipid homeostasis and cholinergic signalling. In contrast, other apoE isoforms are protective. Here we review and discuss these major hypotheses of the apoE4-AD association.
