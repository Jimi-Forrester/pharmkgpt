26279739|a|Advances in burn management over the past 2 decades have resulted in improved survival and reduced morbidity. The treatment of a single patient following a 90% total body surface area injury illustrates the intensity of labour and coordinated hospital care required for such catastrophically injured patients. Data were extracted from the medical records and from personal recollections of the individual members of the multidisciplinary team as well as from the patient. The clinical course and management of complications are described chronologically as a series of overlapping phases from admission to discharge.
