39558765|t|Metabolic Syndrome and the Risk of Alzheimer's Disease: A Meta-Analysis.
39558765|a|Purpose: The relationship between metabolic syndrome (MetS) and the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains unclear. This meta-analysis aims to clarify the prospective association between MetS and AD risk and to explore how individual MetS components contribute to this relationship. Methods: Comprehensive searches of MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Embase were conducted up to April 12, 2024. Relevant prospective cohort studies were included. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to assess the associations. A random-effects model was used to incorporate the potential impact of heterogeneity. Findings: Six prospective cohort studies with seven datasets, including 484,994 participants and a follow-up of 3.5 to 13.0 years, were included. The pooled analysis showed no significant association between MetS and AD risk (HR: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.89-1.04, P = 0.37; I2 = 0%). Sensitivity and subgroup analyses confirmed these findings. Individual MetS components exhibited varied effects as follows: abdominal obesity was linked to a reduced AD risk (Risk ratio (RR): 0.70, 95% CI: 0.56-0.88, P = 0.002), whereas high blood pressure (BP) (RR: 1.15, 95% CI: 1.04-1.27, P = 0.007) and hyperglycemia (RR: 1.24, 95% CI: 1.08-1.42, P = 0.002) were associated with an increased risk. Low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and high triglycerides showed no significant associations. Conclusions: This meta-analysis found no significant overall association between MetS and AD risk. However, specific MetS components, such as abdominal obesity, high BP, and hyperglycemia, may influence AD risk differently.
