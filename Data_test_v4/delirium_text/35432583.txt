35432583|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a brain illness that affects learning and memory capacities over time. In recent investigations, acupuncture has been shown to be an effective alternative treatment for AD. We investigated the effect of acupuncture on learning and memory abilities using a water maze in APP/PS1 transgenic mice. The amounts of Abeta and tau protein in mice's hippocampal tissue were determined using Western blot. The levels of IL-1beta, IL-10, LPS and TNF-alpha in mice's serum were measured using ELISA. The variations of gut microbiota in mice's feces were determined using the 16SrDNA technique, and the metabolites were examined using a untargeted metabolomics methodology. The results showed that acupuncture treatment improved mice's learning and memory abilities substantially. Acupuncture therapy regulated the Abeta and tau protein concentration as well as the levels of IL-10 and LPS. Acupuncture treatment influenced the mouse microbiota and metabolites and had been linked to six biochemical pathways. This study adds to our understanding of the effect of acupuncture on AD and opens the door to further research into the alterations of intestinal bacteria in the presence of AD.
