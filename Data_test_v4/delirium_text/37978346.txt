37978346|a|OBJECTIVE: To examine the effect of preoperative sleep disorders on delirium in patients older than 60 years of age who underwent surgery for proximal femoral fracture. METHODS: This is a prospective observational study. We prospectively selected 143 patients with proximal femoral fracture who underwent surgery between April 2021 and April 2022. The primary outcome was postoperative delirium (PD). Multiple logistic regression analyses were performed and a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was generated. The preoperative sleep quality of all eligible participants was assessed through the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). The Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) was used to assess PD from the first to the seventh day postoperatively. Patients were divided into two groups according to the PD diagnosis: (1) the no PD (NPD) group and (2) the PD (PD) group. RESULTS: Of 143 eligible patients, 43 (30.1%) were diagnosed with PD. Multiple logistic regression analysis demonstrated that postoperative ICU admissions (OR = 2.801, p = 0.049) and preoperative sleep disorders (OR = 1.477 p < 0.001) were independently associated with PD. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve demonstrated that the preoperative PSQI score was predictive of PD (AUC 0.808, 95% CI 0.724 ~ 0.892, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Preoperative sleeping disorders may be an independent risk factor leading to PD and an independent predictive factor for the development of delirium in proximal femoral surgery patients aged 60 or older.
