31467572|a|The objective of this study was to explore the neuroprotective effect of moxibustion on rats with Parkinson's disease (PD) and its mechanism. A Parkinson's disease model was established in rats using a two-point stereotactic 6-hydroxydopamine injection in the right substantia nigra (SN) and ventral tegmental area. The rats received moxibustion at the Baihui (GV20) and Sishencong (EX-HN1) acupoints for 20 minutes, six times a week, for 6 weeks. The right SN tissue was histologically and immunohistochemically examined. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified through RNA sequencing. In addition, the levels of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), and ferritin heavy chain 1 (FTH1) in SN were measured. In comparison to the model group, the moxibustion group showed a significantly greater TH immunoreactivity and a higher behavioural score. In particular, moxibustion led to an increase in the number and morphological stability of SN neural cells. The functional pathway analysis showed that DEGs are closely related to the ferroptosis pathway. GPX4 and FTH1 in the SN were significantly overexpressed in the moxibustion-treated rats with PD. Moxibustion can effectively reduce the death of SN neurons, decrease the occurrence of ferroptosis, and increase the TH activity to protect the neurons in rats with PD. The protective mechanism may be associated with suppression of the ferroptosis.
