36436797|a|Herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) is a widespread neurotropic virus that can reach the brain and cause a rare but acute herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE) with a high mortality rate. Most patients present with changes in neurological and behavioral status, and survivors suffer long-term neurological sequelae. To date, the pathogenesis leading to brain damage is still not well understood. HSV-1 induced encephalitis in the central nervous system (CNS) in animals are usually very diffuse and progressing rapidly, and mostly fatal, making the analysis difficult. Here, we established a mouse model of HSE via intracerebral inoculation of modified version of neural-attenuated strains of HSV-1 (deletion of ICP34.5 and inserting a strong promoter into the latency-associated transcript region), in which the LMR-alphaDeltapA strain initiated moderate productive infection, leading to strong host immune and inflammatory response characterized by persistent microglia activation. This viral replication activity and prolonged inflammatory response activated signaling pathways in neuronal damage, amyloidosis, Alzheimer's disease, and neurodegeneration, eventually leading to neuronal loss and behavioral changes characterized by hypokinesia. Our study reveals detailed pathogenic processes and persistent inflammatory responses in the CNS and provides a controlled, mild and non-lethal HSE model for studying long-term neuronal injury and increased risk of neurodegenerative diseases due to HSV-1 infection.
