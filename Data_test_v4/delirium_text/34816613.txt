METHODS: Cognitive fusion questionnaire (CFQ), Acceptance and Action Questionnaire-2nd edition (AAQ-II), adolescent nonsuicidal self-injury behavior questionnaire (ANSAQ), Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA), and Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD) were used as research tools to investigate 120 subjects with NSSI and 130 healthy controls. RESULTS: The scores of CFQ and AAQ-II in the NSSI group were significantly higher than those in the healthy control group (p < .001). The results of regression analysis showed that the experiential avoidance score of patients with NSSI could predict the score of self-injury questionnaire (beta = 0.585, p < .001); when predicting anxiety, only CFQ (beta = 0.361, p < .001) entered the equation, with an explanatory variation of 12.3%; when predicting depression, CFQ (beta = 0.287, p < .01) entered the equation, with an explanatory variation of 7.4%. CONCLUSION: A high level of cognitive fusion and experiential avoidance may be important factors for the maintenance of self-injury behavior in patients with NSSI.
