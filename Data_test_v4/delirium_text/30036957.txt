30036957|t|Appetite, Metabolism and Hormonal Regulation in Normal Ageing and Dementia.
30036957|a|Feeding and nutrition follow the growth trajectory of the course of life. The profound physiological changes that human body experiences during ageing affect separate aspects of food intake, from tastant perception to satiety. Concurrent morbidities, such as neurodegeneration, as seen in dementia, and metabolic syndrome, may further shape nutritional behaviours, status and adequacy. In an effort to fill the gap between the exhausting basic research and the actual needs of professionals caring for the exponentially expanding ageing population, the current review addresses major factors relevant to appetite and eating disturbances. Does age alter the perception of food modalities? Is food generally still perceived as alluring and delicious with age? Is there an interplay between ageing, cognitive decline, and malnutrition? What tools can we adopt for proper and timely monitoring? Finally, what anatomical and pathophysiological evidence exists to support a hypothesis of central regulation of metabolic perturbations in normal and accelerated cognitive impairment, and how can we benefit from it in health practice?
