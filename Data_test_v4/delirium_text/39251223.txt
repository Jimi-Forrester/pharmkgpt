39251223|t|[Tau Positron Emission Tomography: Applications in Diagnosis and Prognosis of Various Diseases].
39251223|a|Tau positron emission tomography (PET) is a neuroimaging technique that visualizes tau deposition using PET tracers that selectively bind to tau aggregates. Studies have reported the diagnostic and prognostic value of tau PET in Alzheimer's disease and other tauopathies. However, the binding profiles of tau PET drugs vary widely across tauopathies; therefore, an accurate understanding of the disease-specific characteristics is essential for interpretation of tau PET findings. In this review, we discuss the properties of tau-PET agents and their applications in various diseases.
