34863809|t|The effect of a post-scan processing denoising system on image quality and morphometric analysis.
34863809|a|PURPOSE: MR image quality and subsequent brain morphometric analysis are inevitably affected by noise. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of an artificial intelligence (AI)-based post-scan processing denoising system, intelligent Quick Magnetic Resonance (iQMR), on MR image quality and brain morphometric analysis. METHODS: We used 1.5T MP-RAGE MR images acquired from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 1 database. The images of 21 subjects were used for cross-sectional analysis and 15 for longitudinal analysis. In the longitudinal analysis, two timepoints over a 2-year interval were used. Each subject was scanned twice at each timepoint. MR images processed with and without the denoising system were compared both visually and objectively using FreeSurfer cortical thickness analysis. RESULTS: The denoising system reduced the noise with good white-gray matter contrast (noise: p < 0.001; contrast: p = 0.49). The mean intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) of cortical thickness were slightly better in the images processed with the denoising system (0.739/0.859/0.883; Gaussian smoothing kernel of full width at half maximum = 0/10/20) compared with the unprocessed images (0.718/0.854/0.880). In the longitudinal analysis, the mean ICCs of symmetrized percent change improved in images processed with the denoising system (0.202/0.349/0.431) compared with the unprocessed images (0.167/0.325/0.404). In addition, the detectability of significant cortical thickness atrophy improved with denoising. CONCLUSION: We confirm that the AI-based denoising system could effectively reduce the noise while retaining the contrast. We also confirm the improvement of the reliability and detectability of brain morphometric analysis with the denoising system.
