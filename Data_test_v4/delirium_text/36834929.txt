36834929|a|Neuroinfections of the central nervous system (CNS) can be triggered by various pathogens. Viruses are the most widespread and have the potential to induce long-term neurologic symptoms with potentially lethal outcomes. In addition to directly affecting their host cells and inducing immediate changes in a plethora of cellular processes, viral infections of the CNS also trigger an intense immune response. Regulation of the innate immune response in the CNS depends not only on microglia, which are fundamental immune cells of the CNS, but also on astrocytes. These cells align blood vessels and ventricle cavities, and consequently, they are one of the first cell types to become infected after the virus breaches the CNS. Moreover, astrocytes are increasingly recognized as a potential viral reservoir in the CNS; therefore, the immune response initiated by the presence of intracellular virus particles may have a profound effect on cellular and tissue physiology and morphology. These changes should be addressed in terms of persisting infections because they may contribute to recurring neurologic sequelae. To date, infections of astrocytes with different viruses originating from genetically distinct families, including Flaviviridae, Coronaviridae, Retroviridae, Togaviridae, Paramyxoviridae, Picomaviridae, Rhabdoviridae, and Herpesviridae, have been confirmed. Astrocytes express a plethora of receptors that detect viral particles and trigger signaling cascades, leading to an innate immune response. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on virus receptors that initiate the release of inflammatory cytokines from astrocytes and depict the involvement of astrocytes in immune functions of the CNS.
