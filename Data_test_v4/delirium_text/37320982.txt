37320982|a|The therapeutic strategy employing destabilization of the preformed Abeta fibril by various natural compounds, as studied by experimental and computational methods, has been reported significant in curing Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, lycopene (a carotenoid), from terpenes family, needs investigation for its destabilization potential of Abeta fibril. The highest antioxidant potential and ability to cross blood brain barrier makes lycopene a preferred choice as drug lead for treating AD. The current study focuses on investigating the destabilization potential and underpinning mechanism of lycopene on different polymorphic forms of Abeta fibril via Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation. The key findings highlight binding of lycopene to the outer surface of the chain F of the fibril (2NAO). Herein G9, K16 and V18 residues were found to be involved in van der Waals with the methyl groups of the lycopene. Additionally, Y10 and F20 residues were observed to interact via pi-pi interactions with CC bonds of the lycopene. The surface mediated binding of lycopene to the fibril is attributed to the large size and structural rigidity of lycopene along with the bulky size of 2NAO and narrow space of fibrillar cavity. The destabilization of the fibril is evident by breakage of inherent H-bonds and hydrophobic interactions in the presence of one lycopene molecule. The lesser beta-sheet content explains disorganization of the fibril and bars the higher order aggregation curbing neurotoxicity of the fibril. The higher concentration of the lycopene is not found to be linearly correlated with the extent of destabilization of the fibril. Lycopene is also observed to destabilize the other polymorphic form of Abeta fibril (2BEG), by accessing the fibrillar cavity and lowering the beta-sheet content. The destabilization observed by lycopene on two major polymorphs of Abeta fibril explains its potency towards developing an effective therapeutic approach in treating AD.
