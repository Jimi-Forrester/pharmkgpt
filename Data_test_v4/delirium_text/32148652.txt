32148652|t|Dielectric Constant and Conductivity of Blood Plasma: Possible Novel Biomarkers for Alzheimer's Disease.
32148652|a|Alzheimer's disease is a complex debilitating neurodegenerative disease for which there is no cure. The lack of reliable biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease has made the evaluation of the efficacy of new treatments difficult and reliant on only clinical symptoms. In an aged population where cognitive function may be deteriorating for other reasons, the dependence on clinical symptoms is also unreliable. However, it is well established that infusion of beta-amyloid into the dorsal hippocampus of rats leads to cognitive impairment in a rat model of Alzheimer's disease. Moreover, the blood plasma of beta-amyloid-lesioned rats exhibits a distinct variation of the dielectric constant and conductivity when compared to that of normal rats in a time-dependent manner. These two electric parameters of blood plasma may therefore act as potential biomarkers for dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. This review is aimed at highlighting evidences that support blood plasma electrical properties, e.g., dielectric constant and conductivity as possible novel biomarkers for the early development and progression of dementia due to Alzheimer's disease.
