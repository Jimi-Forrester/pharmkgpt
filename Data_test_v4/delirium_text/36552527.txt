36552527|t|Effects of Antioxidant Gene Overexpression on Stress Resistance and Malignization In Vitro and In Vivo: A Review.
36552527|a|Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are normal products of a number of biochemical reactions and are important signaling molecules. However, at the same time, they are toxic to cells and have to be strictly regulated by their antioxidant systems. The etiology and pathogenesis of many diseases are associated with increased ROS levels, and many external stress factors directly or indirectly cause oxidative stress in cells. Within this context, the overexpression of genes encoding the proteins in antioxidant systems seems to have become a viable approach to decrease the oxidative stress caused by pathological conditions and to increase cellular stress resistance. However, such manipulations unavoidably lead to side effects, the most dangerous of which is an increased probability of healthy tissue malignization or increased tumor aggression. The aims of the present review were to collect and systematize the results of studies devoted to the effects resulting from the overexpression of antioxidant system genes on stress resistance and carcinogenesis in vitro and in vivo. In most cases, the overexpression of these genes was shown to increase cell and organism resistances to factors that induce oxidative and genotoxic stress but to also have different effects on cancer initiation and promotion. The last fact greatly limits perspectives of such manipulations in practice. The overexpression of GPX3 and SOD3 encoding secreted proteins seems to be the "safest" among the genes that can increase cell resistance to oxidative stress. High efficiency and safety potential can also be found for SOD2 overexpression in combinations with GPX1 or CAT and for similar combinations that lead to no significant changes in H2O2 levels. Accumulation, systematization, and the integral analysis of data on antioxidant gene overexpression effects can help to develop approaches for practical uses in biomedical and agricultural areas. Additionally, a number of factors such as genetic and functional context, cell and tissue type, differences in the function of transcripts of one and the same gene, regulatory interactions, and additional functions should be taken into account.
