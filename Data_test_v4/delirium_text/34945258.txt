34945258|t|The Impact of Advance Directive Perspectives on the Completion of Life-Sustaining Treatment Decisions in Patients with Heart Failure: A Prospective Study.
34945258|a|Evidence for non-modifiable and modifiable factors associated with the utilization of advance directives (ADs) in heart failure (HF) is lacking. The purpose of this study was to examine baseline-to-3-month changes in knowledge, attitudes, and benefits/barriers regarding ADs and their impact on the completion of life-sustaining treatment (LST) decisions at 3-month follow-up among patients with HF. Prospective, descriptive data on AD knowledge, attitudes, and benefits/barriers and LSTs were obtained at baseline and 3-month follow-up after outpatient visits. Of 64 patients (age, 68.6 years; male, 60.9%; New York Heart Association (NYHA) classes I/II, 70.3%), 53.1% at baseline and 43.8% at 3-month follow-up completed LST decisions. Advanced age (odds ratio (OR) = 0.91, p = 0.012) was associated with less likelihood of the completion of LST decisions at 3-month follow-up, while higher education (OR = 1.19, p = 0.025) and NYHA class III/IV (OR = 4.81, p = 0.049) were associated with more likelihood. In conclusion, advanced age predicted less likelihood of LST decisions at 3 months, while higher education and more functional impairment predicted more likelihood. These results imply that early AD discussion seems feasible in mild symptomatic HF patients with poor knowledge about ADs, considering the non-modifiable and modifiable factors.
