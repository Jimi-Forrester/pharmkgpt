36298748|t|Investigating the Role of African Horse Sickness Virus VP7 Protein Crystalline Particles on Virus Replication and Release.
36298748|a|African horse sickness is a deadly and highly infectious disease of equids, caused by African horse sickness virus (AHSV). AHSV is one of the most economically important members of the Orbivirus genus. AHSV is transmitted by the biting midge, Culicoides, and therefore replicates in both insect and mammalian cell types. Structural protein VP7 is a highly conserved major core protein of orbiviruses. Unlike any other orbivirus VP7, AHSV VP7 is highly insoluble and forms flat hexagonal crystalline particles of unknown function in AHSV-infected cells and when expressed in mammalian or insect cells. To examine the role of AHSV VP7 in virus replication, a plasmid-based reverse genetics system was used to generate a recombinant AHSV that does not form crystalline particles. We characterised the role of VP7 crystalline particle formation in AHSV replication in vitro and found that soluble VP7 interacted with viral proteins VP2 and NS2 similarly to wild-type VP7 during infection. Interestingly, soluble VP7 was found to form uncharacteristic tubule-like structures in infected cells which were confirmed to be as a result of unique VP7-NS1 colocalisation. Furthermore, it was found that VP7 crystalline particles play a role in AHSV release and yield. This work provides insight into the role of VP7 aggregation in AHSV cellular pathogenesis and contributes toward the understanding of the possible effects of viral protein aggregation in other human virus-borne diseases.
