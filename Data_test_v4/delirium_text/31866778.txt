31866778|t|Organ Dysfunction in Sepsis: An Ominous Trajectory From Infection To Death.
31866778|a|Sepsis is a highly complex and lethal syndrome with highly heterogeneous clinical manifestations that makes it difficult to detect and treat. It is also one of the major and most urgent global public health challenges. More than 30 million people are diagnosed with sepsis each year, with 5 million attributable deaths and long-term sequalae among survivors. The current international consensus defines sepsis as a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to an infection. Over the past decades substantial research has increased the understanding of its pathophysiology. The immune response induces a severe macro and microcirculatory dysfunction that leads to a profound global hypoperfusion, injuring multiple organs. Consequently, patients with sepsis might present dysfunction of virtually any system, regardless of the site of infection. The organs more frequently affected are kidneys, liver, lungs, heart, central nervous system, and hematologic system. This multiple organ failure is the hallmark of sepsis and determines patients' course from infection to recovery or death. There are tools to assess the severity of the disease that can also help to guide treatment, like the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score. However, sepsis disease process is vastly heterogeneous, which could explain why interventions targeted to directly intervene its mechanisms have shown unsuccessful results and predicting outcomes with accuracy is still elusive. Thus, it is required to implement strong public health strategies and leverage novel technologies in research to improve outcomes and mitigate the burden of sepsis and septic shock worldwide.
