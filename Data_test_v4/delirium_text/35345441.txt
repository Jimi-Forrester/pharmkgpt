35345441|a|Catechins are a phytochemical present in plants such as tea leaves, beans, black grapes, cherries, and cacao, and have various physiological activities. It is reported that catechins have a health improvement effect and ameliorating effect against various diseases. In addition, antioxidant activity, liver damage prevention, cholesterol lowering effect, and anti-obesity activity were confirmed through in vivo animal and clinical studies. Although most diseases are reported as ones mediating various inflammations, the mechanism for improving inflammation remains unclear. Therefore, the current review article evaluates the physiological activity and various pharmacological actions of catechins and conclude by confirming an improvement effect on the inflammatory response.
