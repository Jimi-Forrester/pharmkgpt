12200143|a|In brain, nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK) and its coding gene, nm23, have been implicated to modulate neuronal cell proliferation, differentiation, and neurite outgrowth. However, a role of NDPK in neurodegenerative diseases has not been reported yet. Using proteomics techniques, we evaluated the protein levels of NDPK-A in seven brain regions from patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Down syndrome (DS) showing AD-like neuropathology. NDPK-A was significantly decreased in brain regions (frontal, occipital, and parietal cortices) of both disorders. Due to the limitation of brain samples, the activity of NDPK was measured in three brain regions (frontal cortex, temporal cortex, and cerebellum). The specific activity of NDPK was significantly decreased in AD (frontal cortex) and DS (frontal and temporal cortices). Since NDPK-B could also drive the activity of NDPK, protein expression levels of both NDPK-A and NDPK-B were studied in frontal cortex by Western blot analysis. NDPK-A was significantly decreased in AD, which was consistent with the results of proteomics. However, NDPK-A was slightly decreased in DS and protein expression levels of NDPK-B in both DS and AD were moderately decreased, without reaching statistical significance. We propose that oxidative modification of NDPK could lead to the decreased activity of NDPK and, subsequently, influence several neuronal functions in neurodegenerative diseases as multifunctional enzyme through several mechanisms.
