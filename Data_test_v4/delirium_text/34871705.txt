34871705|a|AIM: To investigate the influence of apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype on cortical activity, using the event-related potential P300 in healthy older adults and individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: A cohort of 37 healthy older adults and 48 with AD participated in this study and completed an auditory oddball task using electroencephalographic equipment with 21 channels (10-20 system). APOE genotyping was obtained by real-time PCR. RESULTS: AD presented increased P300 latency and lower P300 amplitude, compared to healthy older adults. AD APOE epsilon4 carriers presented increased P300 latency in F3 (420.7 +- 65.8 ms), F4 (412.0 +- 49.0 ms), C4 (413.0 +- 41.1 ms) and P3 (420.4 +- 55.7 ms) compared to non-carriers (F3 = 382.5 +- 56.8 ms, p < 0.01; F4 = 372.2 +- 56.7 ms, p < 0.01; C4 = 374.2 +- 51.7 ms, p < 0.01; P3 = 384.4 +- 44.4 ms, p < 0.01). Healthy older adults APOE epsilon4 carriers presented lower Fz amplitude (2.6 +- 1.5 muV) compared to non-carriers (4.9 +- 2.9 muV; p = 0.02). Linear regression analysis showed that being a carrier of APOE epsilon4 allele remained significantly associated with P300 latency even after adjusting for sex, age, and cognitive grouping. APOE epsilon4 allele increases P300 latency (95% CI 0.11-0.98; p = 0.02). CONCLUSION: APOE epsilon4 allele negatively impacts cortical activity in both healthy older adults and AD individuals.
