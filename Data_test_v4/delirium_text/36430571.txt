36430571|t|Proteomic Analysis Reveals That Mitochondria Dominate the Hippocampal Hypoxic Response in Mice.
36430571|a|Hypoxic stress occurs in various physiological and pathological states, such as aging, disease, or high-altitude exposure, all of which pose a challenge to many organs in the body, necessitating adaptation. However, the exact mechanisms by which hypoxia affects advanced brain function (learning and memory skills in particular) remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the effects of hypoxic stress on hippocampal function. Specifically, we studied the effects of the dysfunction of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation using global proteomics. First, we found that hypoxic stress impaired cognitive and motor abilities, whereas it caused no substantial changes in the brain morphology or structure of mice. Second, bioinformatics analysis indicated that hypoxia affected the expression of 516 proteins, of which 71.1% were upregulated and 28.5% were downregulated. We demonstrated that mitochondrial function was altered and manifested as a decrease in NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) 1 alpha subcomplex 4 expression, accompanied by increased reactive oxygen species generation, resulting in further neuronal injury. These results may provide some new insights into how hypoxic stress alters hippocampal function via the dysfunction of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation.
