18803179|t|Sensitive analysis of donepezil in plasma by capillary electrophoresis combining on-column field-amplified sample stacking and its application in Alzheimer's disease.
18803179|a|Field-amplified sample stacking (FASS) in capillary electrophoresis (CE) was used to determine the concentration of donepezil, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, in human plasma. A sample pretreatment by liquid-liquid extraction with isopropanol/n-hexane (v/v 3:97) and subsequent quantification by FASS-CE was used. Before sample loading, a water plug (0.5 psi, 6 s) was injected to permit FASS. Electrokinetic injection (7 kV, 90 s) was used to introduce sample cations. The separation condition for donepezil was performed in electrolyte solutions containing Tris buffer (60 mM, pH 4.0) with sodium octanesulfonate 40 mM and 0.01% polyvinyl alcohol as a dynamic coating to reduce analytes' interaction with capillary wall. The separation was performed at 28 kV and detected at 200 nm. Using atenolol as an internal standard, the linear ranges of the method for the determination of donepezil in human plasma were over a range of 1-50 ng/mL. The limit of detection was 0.1 ng/mL (S/N=3, sampling 90 s at 7 kV). One female volunteer (54 years old) was orally administered a single dose of 10 mg donepezil (Aricept, Eisai), and blood samples were drawn over a 60 h period for pharmacokinetic study. The method was also applied successfully to monitor donepezil in sixteen Alzheimer's disease patients' plasmas.
