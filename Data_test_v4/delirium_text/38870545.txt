38870545|a|BACKGROUND: Response to antipsychotic drugs (APD) varies greatly among individuals and is affected by genetic factors. This study aims to demonstrate genome-wide associations between copy number variants (CNVs) and response to APD in patients with schizophrenia. METHODS: A total of 3030 patients of Han Chinese ethnicity randomly received APD (aripiprazole, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, ziprasidone, haloperidol and perphenazine) treatment for six weeks. This study is a secondary data analysis. Percentage change on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) reduction was used to assess APD efficacy, and more than 50% change was considered as APD response. Associations between CNV burden, gene set, CNV loci and CNV break-point and APD efficacy were analysed. FINDINGS: Higher CNV losses burden decreased the odds of 6-week APD response (OR = 0.66 [0.44, 0.98]). CNV losses in synaptic pathway involved in neurotransmitters were associated with 2-week PANSS reduction rate. CNV involved in sialylation (1p31.1 losses) and cellular metabolism (19q13.32 gains) associated with 6-week PANSS reduction rate at genome-wide significant level. Additional 36 CNVs associated with PANSS factors improvement. The OR of protective CNVs for 6-week APD response was 3.10 (95% CI: 1.33-7.19) and risk CNVs was 8.47 (95% CI: 1.92-37.43). CNV interacted with genetic risk score on APD efficacy (Beta = -1.53, SE = 0.66, P = 0.021). The area under curve to differ 6-week APD response attained 80.45% (95% CI: 78.07%-82.82%). INTERPRETATION: Copy number variants contributed to poor APD efficacy and synaptic pathway involved in neurotransmitter was highlighted.
