36993170|a|Background: Assessment of personality change in Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) is clinically meaningful but complicated by patient (i.e., reduced insight) and informant (i.e., caregiver burden) factors that confound accurate reporting of personality traits. This study assessed the impact of caregiver burden on informant report of Big Five personality traits (Extraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Neuroticism, and Openness) and investigated regional cortical volumes associated with larger discrepancies in patient and informant report of Big Five personality traits. Methods: Sixty-four ADRD participants with heterogeneous neurodegenerative clinical phenotypes and their informants completed the Big Five Inventory (BFI). Caregiver burden was measured using the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI). Discrepancy scores were computed as the absolute value of the difference between patient and informant ratings for all BFI trait scores and summed to create a global score. Regional grey matter volumes from T1-weighted 3T MRI were normalized to intracranial volume and related to global Big Five discrepancy scores using linear regression. Results: Higher levels of caregiver burden were associated with higher informant ratings of patient Neuroticism (ss =0.27, p =.016) and lower informant ratings of patient Agreeableness (ss =-0.32, p =.002), Conscientiousness (ss =-0.3, p =.002), and Openness (ss =-0.34, p =.003) independent of disease severity. Patients with greater Big Five discrepancy scores showed smaller cortical volumes in right medial PFC (beta = -0.00015, p = .002), right superior temporal gyrus (beta = -0.00028, p = .025), and left inferior frontal gyrus (beta = -0.00006 p = .013). Conclusions: Informant ratings of personality traits in ADRD can be confounded by caregiver burden, highlighting the need for more objective measures of personality and behavior in dementia samples. Discrepancies between informant and patient ratings of personality may additionally reflect loss of insight secondary to cortical atrophy in frontal and temporal structures.
