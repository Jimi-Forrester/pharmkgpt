7726198|a|For some time it has been known through the results of family, twin, and adoption studies that heredity appears to play a significant causal role in many mental disorders, including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and other mood disorders, Alzheimer's Disease, panic disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, autism, dyslexia, and Tourette's Syndrome. The precise patterns of inheritance of these complex disorders have not been determined, nor have the relevant genes been localized or cloned. Because the genetics are complex and because there is also clearly an environmental contribution to behavior, we expect the analysis of the genetics of mental illness to be arduous, and not quickly resolved. There are several compelling reasons to continue to focus our attention on uncovering the genetic factors for severe mental illness. Prominent among these are the implications for better treatment of mental disorders. The National Institute of Mental Health supports a wide range of studies on psychiatric genetic research.
