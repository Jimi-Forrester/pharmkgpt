29480178|t|Age-Related Changes in the Spatial Frequency Threshold of Male and Female 3xTg-AD Mice Using OptoMotry.
29480178|a|Visual impairments and retinal abnormalities occur in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and in mouse models of AD. It is important to know the visual ability of mouse models of AD to ensure that age-related cognitive deficits are not confounded by visual impairments. Using OptoMotry, the spatial frequency thresholds of male and female 3xTg-AD mice did not differ from their B6129SF2 wildtype controls between 1-18 months of age, but females had higher spatial frequency thresholds than males. However, the differences were quite small, and the visual ability of all mice was comparable to that of C57BL/6 mice.
