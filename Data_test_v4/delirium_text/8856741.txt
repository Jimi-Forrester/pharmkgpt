8856741|t|Neurotoxicity induced by prenatal aluminum exposure in rats.
8856741|a|Aluminum has been implicated as a neurotoxic agent in a number of experimental laboratories and epidemiological studies. Dementia has been correlated to elevated aluminum levels in Alzheimer's disease and has been related to impaired motor function and to a number of cognitive deficits in both humans and animals. To determine the neurotoxicity of aluminum (Al) lactate exposure in rat pups, postnatal behavioral effects of 0, 2.5, 5, 10 mg/kg daily s.c. treatment during gestation days 7th-15th were investigated. Offspring were tested for motor coordination, stress tolerance in a swimming test, behavioral patterns in an open field, in the acquisition and extinction of an avoidance responding and in a reconditioning task. In the open field test the horizontal activity was diminished at the top dose of Al exposure. The motor coordination and the stress tolerance were not altered by prenatal Al treatment. The main sign of neurotoxicity was diminished performance and lengthened latency in an avoidance responding task in all treated groups. Our findings confirm that postnatal behavioral effects can be induced in offspring prenatally exposed to aluminum lactate.
