36647262|t|Tau as a biomarker of cognitive impairment and neuropsychiatric symptom in Alzheimer's disease.
36647262|a|The A/T/N research framework has been proposed for the diagnosis and prognosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the spatial distribution of ATN biomarkers and their relationship with cognitive impairment and neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) need further clarification in patients with AD. We scanned 83 AD patients and 38 cognitively normal controls who independently completed the mini-mental state examination and Neuropsychiatric Inventory scales. Tau, Abeta, and hypometabolism spatial patterns were characterized using Statistical Parametric Mapping together with [18F]flortaucipir, [18F]florbetapir, and [18F]FDG positron emission tomography. Piecewise linear regression, two-sample t-tests, and support vector machine algorithms were used to explore the relationship between tau, Abeta, and hypometabolism and cognition, NPS, and AD diagnosis. The results showed that regions with tau deposition are region-specific and mainly occurred in inferior temporal lobes in AD, which extensively overlaps with the hypometabolic regions. While the deposition regions of Abeta were unique and the regions affected by hypometabolism were widely distributed. Unlike Abeta, tau and hypometabolism build up monotonically with increasing cognitive impairment in the late stages of AD. In addition, NPS in AD were associated with tau deposition closely, followed by hypometabolism, but not with Abeta. Finally, hypometabolism and tau had higher accuracy in differentiating the AD patients from controls (accuracy = 0.88, accuracy = 0.85) than Abeta (accuracy = 0.81), and the combined three were the highest (accuracy = 0.95). These findings suggest tau pathology is superior over Abeta and glucose metabolism to identify cognitive impairment and NPS. Its results support tau accumulation can be used as a biomarker of clinical impairment in AD.
