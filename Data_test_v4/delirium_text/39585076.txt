39585076|t|Macamides as Potential Therapeutic Agents in Neurological Disorders.
39585076|a|Therapeutic treatment of nervous system disorders has represented one of the significant challenges in medicine for the past several decades. Technological and medical advances have made it possible to recognize different neurological disorders, which has led to more precise identification of potential therapeutic targets, in turn leading to research into developing drugs aimed at these disorders. In this sense, recent years have seen an increase in exploration of the therapeutic effects of various metabolites extracted from Maca (Lepidium meyenii), a plant native to the central alpine region of Peru. Among the most important secondary metabolites contained in this plant are macamides, molecules derived from N-benzylamides of long-chain fatty acids. Macamides have been proposed as active drugs to treat some neurological disorders. Their excellent human tolerance and low toxicity along with neuroprotective, immune-enhancing, and and antioxidant properties make them ideal for exploration as therapeutic agents. In this review, we have compiled information from various studies on macamides, along with theories about the metabolic pathways on which they act.
