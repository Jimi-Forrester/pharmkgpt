34276252|t|Volatile Versus Intravenous Anesthetics in Cardiac Anesthesia: a Narrative Review.
34276252|a|PURPOSE OF THE REVIEW: The present review addresses clinicians and gives an overview about the experimental rationale for pharmacological conditioning associated with volatile anesthetics, opioids, and propofol; the current clinical data; and the technical considerations regarding the clinical routine in cardiac anesthesia. RECENT FINDINGS: Volatile anesthetics have been standard of care for general anesthesia for cardiac surgery, especially while using cardiopulmonary bypass. The 2019 published MYRIAD trial was not able to show a difference in mortality or cardiac biomarkers for volatile anesthetics compared to total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA), raising the question of equivalence with respect to patient outcome. SUMMARY: Reviewing the literature, the scientific foundation for the belief of clinically relevant conditioning by uninterrupted administration of a volatile anesthetic is weak. TIVA can also be performed safely in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.
