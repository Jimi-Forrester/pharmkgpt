33829062|t|L Antigen Family Member 3 Serves as a Prognostic Biomarker for the Clinical Outcome and Immune Infiltration in Skin Cutaneous Melanoma.
33829062|a|L Antigen Family Member 3 (LAGE3) is an important RNA modification-related protein. Whereas few studies have interrogated the LAGE3 protein, there is limited data on its role in tumors. Here, we analyzed and profiled the LAGE3 protein in skin cutaneous melanoma (CM) using TCGA, GTEx, or GEO databases. Our data showed an upregulation of LAGE3 in melanoma cell lines compared to normal skin cell lines. Besides, the Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazard model revealed that LAGE3 was an independent survival indicator for CM, especially in metastatic CM. Moreover, LAGE3 was negatively associated with multiple immune cell infiltration levels in CM, especially CD8+ T cells in metastatic CM. Taken together, our study suggests that LAGE3 could be a potential prognostic biomarker and might be a potential target for the development of novel CM treatment strategies.
