37086365|t|Microbiological and Physiological Effects of Pain.
37086365|a|Pain is an important innate defense mechanism that can dramatically alter a person's quality of life. Understanding the microbiological and physiological effects of pain may be important in the pursuit of novel pain interventions. The three descriptors of pain recognized by the International Association for the Study of Pain are nociceptive, neuropathic, and nociplastic pain. Our review examined the current understanding of all three pain types, focusing on the key molecules involved in the manifestation of each type as well as physiological effects. Additionally, we compared the differences in painful and painless neuropathies and discussed the neuroimmune interaction involved in the manifestation of pain.
