31204500|t|MicroRNA-101a Regulates Autophagy Phenomenon via the MAPK Pathway to Modulate Alzheimer's-Associated Pathogenesis.
31204500|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a type of neurodegenerative disorder and the most common form of dementia. MicroRNA (miRNA) has been shown to play a role in various diseases, including AD. It also has been reported to regulate autophagy. We extracted miRNA from blood samples and constructed an miRNA-101a lentivirus vector. In this study we found the level of miRNA-101a was significantly reduced in the plasma of patients with AD and APPswe/PS1DeltaE9 transgenic mice. The relative expression of miRNA-101a exhibited a relatively high diagnostic performance (area under receiver operating characteristic curve: 0.8725) in the prediction of AD with a sensitivity of 0.913 and a specificity of 0.733 at the threshold of 0.6463. Under electron microscopy, autophagic vacuoles in AD-related cells numbered more than the cells up-regulating miRNA-101a in the in vitro experiments. Dual-luciferase reporter assay and Western blot results proved that the MAPK1 pathway plays a role in the formation of autophagic vacuoles in AD. This study found that the autophagy phenomenon regulated by miRNA-101a via the MAPK pathway might be a new mechanism in AD. This could provide new insights into AD formation and treatment.
