37697221|t|The Role of Pyroptosis and Autophagy in the Nervous System.
37697221|a|Autophagy is a conservative self-degradation system, which includes the two major processes of enveloping abnormal proteins, organelles and other macromolecules, and transferring them into lysosomes for the subsequent degradation. It holds the stability of the intracellular environment under stress. So far, three types of autophagy have been found: microautophagy, chaperone-mediated autophagy and macroautophagy. Many diseases have the pathological process of autophagy dysfunction, such as nervous system diseases. Pyroptosis is one kind of programmed cell death mediated by gasdermin (GSDM). In this process of pyroptosis, the activated caspase-3, caspase-4/5/11, or caspase-1 cleaves GSDM into the N-terminal pore-forming domain (PFD). The oligomer of PFD combines with the cell membrane to form membrane holes, thus leading to pyroptosis. Pyroptosis plays a key role in multiple tissues and organs. Many studies have revealed that autophagy and pyroptosis participate in the nervous system, but the mechanisms need to be fully clarified. Here, we focused on the recent articles on the role and mechanism of pyroptosis and autophagy in the pathological processes of the nervous system.
