38597159|a|BACKGROUND: Hospitalized patients experience sleep disruption with consequential physiological and psychological effects. Surgical patients are particularly at risk due to surgical stress and postoperative pain. This systematic review aimed to identify non-pharmacological interventions for improving sleep and exploring their effects on sleep-related and clinical outcomes. METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed in accordance with PRISMA guidelines and was preregistered on the Open Science Framework (doi: 10.17605/OSF.IO/EA6BN) and last updated in November 2023. Studies that evaluated non-pharmacological interventions for hospitalized, adult patients were included. Thematic content analysis was performed to identify hypothesized mechanisms of action and modes of administration, in collaboration with a patient partner. Risk of bias assessment was performed using the Cochrane Risk Of Bias (ROB) or Risk Of Bias In Non-Randomized Studies - of Interventions (ROBINS-I) tools. RESULTS: A total of 59 eligible studies and data from 14 035 patients were included; 28 (47.5%) were randomized trials and 26 included surgical patients (10 trials). Thirteen unique non-pharmacological interventions were identified, 17 sleep measures and 7 linked health-related outcomes. Thematic analysis revealed two major themes for improving sleep in hospital inpatients: enhancing the sleep environment and utilizing relaxation and mindfulness techniques. Two methods of administration, self-administered and carer-administered, were identified. Environmental interventions, such as physical aids, and relaxation interventions, including aromatherapy, showed benefits to sleep measures. There was a lack of standardized sleep measurement and an overall moderate to high risk of bias across all studies. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review has identified several sleep interventions that are likely to benefit adult surgical patients, but there remains a lack of high-quality evidence to support their routine implementation.
