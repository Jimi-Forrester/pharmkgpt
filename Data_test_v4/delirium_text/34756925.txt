34756925|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease. Exosomes are extracellular vesicles secreted by a variety of cells, and they participate in intercellular communication by transferring microRNA (miRNA) and other substances. Among the various internal and external factors involved in the occurrence and development of AD, exosome-derived miRNAs have become essential in the pathogenesis and treatment of AD. As nanocarriers of miRNA, exosomes are expected to become an important tool in the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of AD. This article reviews the roles of exosomal miRNAs in the pathophysiological process, diagnostic biomarkers and treatment of AD.
