28984138|a|Some studies showed that Val66Met polymorphism of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) conveys susceptibility to Alzheimer's disease (AD) in females only. However, the confounding effects of some risk factors for AD were omitted in these studies. The aim of this meta-analysis comprising 19 604 patients with AD and 26 333 controls was to reexamine the association between Val66Met and AD by conditioning the effects of age, sex, and/or apolipoprotein E ( APOE) epsilon4 status. In agreement with the previous meta-analysis, Val66Met was associated with AD in females without confounding adjustment (odds ratio [OR], 1.08; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-1.14; P = .003). Nevertheless, after adjusting for age and APOE epsilon4 status, Val66Met was not associated with AD in females (OR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.94-1.11; P = .57). This comprehensive meta-analysis with the largest sample size demonstrated no association could be observed between Val66Met and AD in general or by dividing samples based on sex or APOE epsilon4.
