21088470|t|Microglial P2X7 receptor expression is accompanied by neuronal damage in the cerebral cortex of the APPswe/PS1dE9 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
21088470|a|The possibility that P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) expression in microglia would mediate neuronal damage via reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was examined in the APPswe/PS1dE9 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD). P2X7R was predominantly expressed in CD11b-immunopositive microglia from 3 months of age before Abeta plaque formation. In addition, gp91phox, a catalytic subunit of NADPH oxidase, and ethidium fluorescence were detected in P2X7R-positive microglial cells of animals at 6 months of age, indicating that P2X7R-positive microglia could produce ROS. Postsynaptic density 95-positive dendrites showed significant damage in regions positive for P2X7R in the cerebral cortex of 6 month-old mice. Taken together, up-regulation of P2X7R activation and ROS production in microglia are parallel with Abeta increase and correlate with synaptotoxicity in AD.
