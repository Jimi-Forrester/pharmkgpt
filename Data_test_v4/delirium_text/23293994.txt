23293994|a|PURPOSE: To study the caregiver's distress with symptoms of delirium. DESIGN AND METHODS: Consenting adult caregivers (>18 years of age) of patients with delirium were evaluated for the distress due to symptoms of delirium. RESULTS: The study included 72 primary caregivers of patients with delirium. Symptoms of delirium that led to severe or very severe distress in more than two thirds of the caregivers included decreased sleep, increased motor activity, attempts to remove intravenous lines, tubings, etc., and attempts to get out of bed when they were actually required to lie down. CONCLUSIONS: Overall experience of delirium was very distressing for the caregivers.
