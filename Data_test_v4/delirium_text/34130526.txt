METHODS: Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats and SHRs were administered the UCHL1 inhibitor LDN57444 (20 mug/kg/day) for 4 months. Pathological changes were detected with hematoxylin and eosin, immunofluorescence, and dihydroethidium staining. The mRNA and protein expression of UCHL1 were examined by real-time PCR and immunoblotting analysis. RESULTS: At 6 months of age, SHRs showed significantly increased mRNA and protein levels of UCHL1 in the retina compared with WKY rats. Moreover, SHRs exhibited significantly increased central retinal thickness, inflammation, and reactive oxygen species production compared with WKY rats, and these effects were markedly attenuated by systemic administration of the UCHL1 inhibitor LDN57444. The beneficial effects of LDN57444 were possibly associated with reduced blood pressure and the inactivation of several signaling pathways. CONCLUSION: UCHL1 is involved in hypertension and retinopathy in SHRs, suggesting that UCHL1 may be used as a potential therapeutic target for treating hypertensive retinopathy.
