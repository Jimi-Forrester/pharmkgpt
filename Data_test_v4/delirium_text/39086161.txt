39086161|a|OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to use deep learning (DL) to develop a cost-effective and accessible screening tool to improve the detection of cognitive decline, a precursor of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study integrating a comprehensive battery of neuropsychological tests adjusted for individual demographic variables such as age, sex, and education level. METHODS: A total of 2,863 subjects with subjective cognitive complaints who underwent a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment were included. A random forest classifier was used to discern the most predictive test combinations to distinguish between dementia and nondementia cases. The model was trained and validated on this dataset, focusing on feature importance to determine the cognitive tests that were most indicative of decline. RESULTS: Subjects had a mean age of 72.68 years and an average education level of 7.62 years. The DL model achieved an accuracy of 82.42% and an area under the curve of 0.816, effectively classifying dementia. Feature importance analysis identified significant tests across cognitive domains: attention was gauged by the Trail Making Test Part B, language by the Boston Naming Test, memory by the Rey Complex Figure Test delayed recall, visuospatial skills by the Rey Complex Figure Test copy score, and frontal function by the Stroop Test Word reading time. CONCLUSION: This study showed the potential of DL to improve AD diagnostics, suggesting that a wide range of cognitive assessments could yield a more accurate diagnosis than traditional methods. This research establishes a foundation for future broader studies, which could substantiate the approach and further refine the screening tool.
