32794732|t|Structural Characteristics of Monomeric Abeta42 on Fibril in the Early Stage of Secondary Nucleation Process.
32794732|a|Amyloid-beta (Abeta) aggregates are believed to be one of the main causes of Alzheimer's disease. Abeta peptides form fibrils having cross beta-sheet structures mainly through primary nucleation, secondary nucleation, and elongation. In particular, self-catalyzed secondary nucleation is of great interest. Here, we investigate the adsorption of Abeta42 peptides to the Abeta42 fibril to reveal a role of adsorption as a part of secondary nucleation. We performed extensive molecular dynamics simulations based on replica exchange with solute tempering 2 (REST2) to two systems: a monomeric Abeta42 in solution and a complex of an Abeta42 peptide and Abeta42 fibril. Results of our simulations show that the Abeta42 monomer is extended on the fibril. Furthermore, we find that the hairpin structure of the Abeta42 monomer decreases but the helix structure increases by adsorption to the fibril surface. These structural changes are preferable for forming fibril-like aggregates, suggesting that the fibril surface serves as a catalyst in the secondary nucleation process. In addition, the stabilization of the helix structure of the Abeta42 monomer on the fibril indicates that the strategy of a secondary nucleation inhibitor design for Abeta40 can also be used for Abeta42.
