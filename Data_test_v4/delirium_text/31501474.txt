31501474|t|20 Years of DIEAP Flap Breast Reconstruction: A Big Data Analysis.
31501474|a|With every hospital admission, a vast amount of data is collected from every patient. Big data can help in data mining and processing of this volume of data. The goal of this study is to investigate the potential of big data analyses by analyzing clinically relevant data from the immediate postoperative phase using big data mining techniques. A second aim is to understand the importance of different postoperative parameters. We analyzed all data generated during the admission of 739 women undergoing a free DIEAP flap breast reconstruction. The patients' complete midcare nursing report, laboratory data, operative reports and drug schedule were examined (7,405,359 data points). The duration of anesthesia does not predict the need for revision. Low Red Blood cell Counts (3.53 x 106/microL versus 3.79 x 106/microL, p < 0.001) and a low MAP (MAP = 73.37 versus 76.62; p < 0.001) postoperatively are correlated with significantly more revisions. Different drugs (asthma/COPD medication, Butyrophenones) can also play a significant role in the success of the free flap. In a world that is becoming more data driven, there is a clear need for electronic medical records which are easy to use for the practitioner, nursing staff, and the researcher. Very large datasets can be used, and big data analysis allows a relatively easy and fast interpretation all this information.
