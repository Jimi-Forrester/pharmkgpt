21291838|a|This article discussed the central role of the deposition of amyloid beta in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease. (AD), and the animal data which supports the role of cholesterol on its deposition. The effect of mid-life cholesterol is discussed, and the presence of cardiovascular disease risk factors in the patients with evidence for AD and vascular disease. The role of statin therapy is mentioned, although concrete evidence in controlled prospective trials has not been published in a large trial. The value of hygienic approaches including exercise, diet and behavioral changes is mentioned. Currently there are no safe and effective drugs which have been proven to reduce the incidence or the progression of AD, although research in this important area is ongoing.
