36993309|a|Identifying spatially variable genes (SVGs) is critical in linking molecular cell functions with tissue phenotypes. Spatially resolved transcriptomics captures cellular-level gene expression with corresponding spatial coordinates in two or three dimensions and can be used to infer SVGs effectively. However, current computational methods may not achieve reliable results and often cannot handle three-dimensional spatial transcriptomic data. Here we introduce BSP (big-small patch), a spatial granularity-guided and non-parametric model to identify SVGs from two or three-dimensional spatial transcriptomics data in a fast and robust manner. This new method has been extensively tested in simulations, demonstrating superior accuracy, robustness, and high efficiency. BSP is further validated by substantiated biological discoveries in cancer, neural science, rheumatoid arthritis, and kidney studies with various types of spatial transcriptomics technologies.
