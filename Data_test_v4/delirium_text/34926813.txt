34926813|a|This study was performed to determine the comparative efficacy of paracetamol alone versus paracetamol plus ondansetron on acute postoperative pain after abdominal surgeries in Azad University hospitals in 2017 and 2019. In this randomized clinical trial, 62 consecutive patients under abdominal surgeries, were randomly divided into two groups, group 1 patient who received paracetamol alone 1 gram and group 2 patient who received paracetamol 1 gram plus 4 mg ondansetron and the pain severities were determined and compared between groups at recovery and after 4 and 24 hours. The results of this study revealed that there were no statistically significant differences between two groups for the postoperative pain severity and analgesic use ( p > 0.05). It may be concluded that addition of ondansetron to paracetamol would not result in further postoperative pain reduction and additive use of this drug is not recommended.
