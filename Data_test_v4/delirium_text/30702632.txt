30702632|t|Spore powder of Ganoderma lucidum for Alzheimer's disease: A protocol for systematic review.
30702632|a|BACKGROUND: Previous studies have reported that spore powder of Ganoderma lucidum (SPGL) may be effective for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, its efficacy is still inconclusive. Thus, this systematic review will aim to assess its efficacy and safety for AD. METHODS: We will search the electronic databases of Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, MEDILINE, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database, and Chinese Biomedical Literature Database to assess the efficacy and safety of SPGL for patients with AD from their inceptions to the present. All case-control studies and randomized controlled trials will be considered for inclusion in this study. Two review authors will independently perform the study selection, data extraction, and risk of bias evaluation. RESULTS: The primary outcome includes the cognitive status for patients. The secondary outcomes consist of the quality of life, AD symptoms, and adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review will present the existing evidence for the efficacy and safety of SPGL for treating patients with AD. DISSEMINATION AND ETHICS: The results of this systematic review will be disseminated by through peer-reviewed journals. It does not needs ethic approval, because it does not involve individual patient data. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: PROSPERO CRD42019119426.
