35000037|a|Parthanatos is a form of regulated cell death involved in the pathogenesis of many diseases, particularly neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Parthanatos is a multistep cell death pathway cascade that involves poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1) overactivation, PAR accumulation, PAR binding to apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), AIF release from the mitochondria, nuclear translocation of the AIF/macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) complex, and MIF-mediated large-scale DNA fragmentation. All the key players in the parthanatos pathway are pleiotropic proteins with diverse functions. An in-depth understanding of the structure-based activity of the key factors, and the biochemical mechanisms of parthanatos, is crucial for the development of drugs and therapeutic strategies. In this review, we delve into the key players of the parthanatos pathway and reveal the multiple levels of therapeutic opportunities for treating parthanatos-based pathogenesis.
