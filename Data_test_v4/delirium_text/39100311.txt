39100311|t|Benzyloxychalcone Hybrids as Prospective Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitors against Alzheimer's Disease: Rational Design, Synthesis, In Silico ADMET Prediction, QSAR, Molecular Docking, DFT, and Molecular Dynamic Simulation Studies.
39100311|a|Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) are crucial therapeutic targets for both the early and severe stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Chalcones and their chromone-based derivatives are well-known building blocks with anti-Alzheimer properties. This study synthesized 4-benzyloxychalcone derivatives and characterized their structures using IR, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and HRMS. Additionally, the synthesized 4-benzyloxychalcone derivatives were tested for anti-acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity. The synthesized compounds outperformed galantamine, which is used as a positive control against acetylcholinesterase. Utilizing an acetylcholinesterase (AChE) receptor (PDB ID: 4EY7)-chalcone derivative (12a-c), a molecular docking investigation was performed on the synthesized compounds. The goal was to predict the binding sites and energies of the derivatives with respect to the receptor amino acids. The dynamic behavior of the ligand-receptor complex resulting from the interaction of the best docking compounds 12a and 12c with the acetylcholinesterase receptor was used to analyze the stability via MD simulation. MM/GBSA and MM/PBSA were used to calculate free binding energies using snapshots from system trajectories. Advanced computational approaches incorporating long-range corrections were utilized to calculate the molecular characteristics of chalcone derivatives 12a-c at the DFT/wB97XD/6-311++G(d,p) level. We used the molecular electrostatic surface potential (MESP) with high-quality data and visualization to find the most active site in these molecules. Reactivity descriptors, including the condensed Fukui function, chemical hardness (eta), dual descriptors, chemical potential (mu), and electrophilicity (omega), were calculated for the chalcone derivatives.
