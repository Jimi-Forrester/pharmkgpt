36635595|a|Chronic inflammation has been implicated in the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD). Activating the resolution of inflammation through omega-3 fatty acid supplementation may prove to be a successful therapeutic strategy for the treatment of MDD. Patients with MDD, body mass index >25 kg/m2, and plasma high-sensitivity C-reactive protein >=3 mug/mL (n = 61) were enrolled in a 12-week randomized trial consisting of 4 parallel arms: EPA 1, 2, and 4 g/d, and placebo. The supplement contained EPA and DHA in a 3.9:1 ratio. Depression symptoms were assessed using the IDS-C30 scale. Plasma fatty acids and pro-resolving lipid mediators (SPMs) were measured in 42 study completers at baseline and at the end of treatment by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. The response rate (>=50% reduction in IDS-30 score) was higher in the 4 g/d EPA arm than placebo (Cohen d = 0.53). In the 4 g/d EPA arm, responders had significantly greater increases in 18-hydroxyeicosapentaenoic acid (18-HEPE) and 13-hydroxydocosahexaenoic acid (13-HDHA) than non-responders (p < 0.05). Within the 4 g/d EPA arm, the increase in 18-HEPE was significantly associated with reductions in plasma hs-CRP concentrations (p < 0.05) and IDS-C30 scores (p < 0.01). In summary, response rates were greater among patients with MDD randomized to EPA 4 g/d supplementation and in those who showed a greater ability to activate the synthesis of 18-HEPE. The inverse association of 18-HEPE with both systemic inflammation and symptoms of depression highlights the activation of the resolution of inflammation as a likely mechanism in the treatment of MDD with omega-3 fatty acid supplementation.
