31909370|t|Associations of Handgrip Strength with Prevalence of Rheumatoid Arthritis and Diabetes Mellitus in Older Adults.
31909370|a|BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between handgrip strength and prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis and diabetes in older adults. METHODS: A total of 4,186 participants 65 years of age and older was included in the study, which utilized data from the fifth Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Pearson's chi-square tests were used to explore the relationship between frequency of participation in physical activity and handgrip strength. The relationships between handgrip strength and prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis and diabetes were determined by logistic regression. RESULTS: Older adults with higher handgrip strength participated more frequently in walking (right hand, 3.71 day/wk; left hand, 3.80 day/wk), strength (right hand, 1.40 day/wk; left hand, 1.43 day/wk), and flexibility exercises (both hands, 2.08 day/wk) than those with lower handgrip strength (right hand, 2.83 day/wk and left hand, 2.81 day/wk for walking; right hand, 0.18 day/wk and left hand, 0.22 day/wk for strength; right hand, 1.17 day/wk and left hand, 1.24 day/wk for flexibility). Higher handgrip strength was associated with reduced prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis (right hand: odds ratio [OR], 0.29; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.16-0.52; P<0.05; left hand: OR, 0.20; 95% CI, 0.10-0.38; P<0.05) and diabetes (right hand: OR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.57-0.89; P<0.05; left hand: OR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.58-0.88; P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Enhanced handgrip strength was significantly associated with lower prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis and diabetes in older adults. Participating in physical activity should be recommended to older adults for maintaining handgrip strength.
