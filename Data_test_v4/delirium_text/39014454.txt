39014454|a|AIMS: Apply established cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum biomarkers and novel combined indicators based on the amyloid/tau/neurodegeneration (ATN) framework to improve diagnostic and prognostic power in patients with rapidly progressive dementias (RPDs). METHODS: CSF and serum biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) common neuropathology including Abeta42, Abeta40, p-Tau, and t-Tau were measured in cognitively normal (CN) controls (n = 33) and three RPD groups with rapidly progressive AD (rpAD, n = 23), autoimmune encephalitis (AE, n = 25), and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD, n = 28). Logistic regression and multiple linear regression were used for producing combined indicators and prognostic assessment, respectively, including A&T, A&N, T&N, A&T&N, etc. RESULTS: Combined diagnostic indicator with A&T&N had the potential for differentiating AE from other types of RPDs, identifying 62.51% and 75% of AE subjects based on CSF and serum samples, respectively, compared to 39.13% and 37.5% when using autoantibodies. CSF t-Tau was associated with survival in the CJD group (adjusted R-Square = 0.16, p = 0.02), and its prognosis value improved when using combined predictors based on the ATN framework (adjusted R-Square = 0.273, p = 0.014). CONCLUSION: Combined indicators based on the ATN framework provide a novel perspective for establishing biomarkers for early recognition of RPDs due to treatment-responsive causes.
