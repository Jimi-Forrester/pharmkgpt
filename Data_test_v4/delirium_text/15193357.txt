15193357|a|We review the evidence for free radical initiated chain polymerization of biomolecules. Our hypothesis predicts damaging effects of this chain polymerization. Free radical lipid peroxidation could initiate the chain polymerization of amyloid peptides and other biomolecules found in Alzheimer's disease. Reactions forming polymers present in other neurodegenerative diseases could follow the same pathway. Antioxygenic nutrients could protect against free radical oxidant damage, thereby delaying or preventing the onset of Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases The onset of Alzheimer's disease could be delayed if the initiation of free radical chain polymerization were inhibited or limited by nutrients that act as chain terminators or provide reducing conditions to reduce peroxidized lipids in the brain. Vitamins E and C and coenzyme Q are chain terminators. Selenium, sulfur amino acids and vitamin C provide reducing conditions.
