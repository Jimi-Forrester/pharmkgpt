38898363|t|Association between triglyceride-glucose index and the risk of heart failure hospitalization in older diabetic patients received right ventricular pacing: a retrospective cohort study.
38898363|a|BACKGROUND: The prognostic value of triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index is not yet known for older diabetic patients received right ventricular pacing (RVP). We aimed to investigate the association between TyG index and the risk of heart failure hospitalization (HFH) in older diabetic patients received RVP. METHODS: This study was conducted between January 2017 and January 2018 at Fuwai Hospital, Beijing, China, and included older (age >= 65 years) diabetic patients that received RVP for the first time. TyG index were obtained before implantation. The primary endpoint was HFH. RESULTS: A total of 231 patients were divided into three groups according to the tertiles of TyG index: < 8.5 (T1, N = 77), 8.5-9.1 (T2, N = 77), and > 9.1 (T3, N = 77). T3 group had higher rate of HFH (Log-rank = 11.7, P = 0.003). Multivariate analyses showed that, TyG index served as an independent predictor for HFH, both as numerical variable (HR = 1.94, 95% CI 1.21-3.11, P = 0.006), and as categorical variable (HR = 2.31, 95% CI 1.09-4.89, P = 0.03). RCS demonstrated that the risk of HFH was relatively low until TyG index exceeded 8.8, beyond which the risk began to increase rapidly (P-non-linear = 0.006). CONCLUSION: Preimplantation TyG index emerges as a robust, independent predictor for HFH in older diabetic patients received RVP, and TyG index > 8.8 might be the optimal cut-off value.
