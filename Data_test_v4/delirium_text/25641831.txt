25641831|t|Simple Colorimetric Detection of Amyloid beta-peptide (1-40) based on Aggregation of Gold Nanoparticles in the Presence of Copper Ions.
25641831|a|A simple method for specific colorimetric sensing of Alzheimer's disease related amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) is developed based on the aggregation of gold nanoparticles in the presence of copper ion. The detection of limit for Abeta(1-40) is 0.6 nM and the promising results from practical samples (human serum) indicate the great potential for the routine detection.
