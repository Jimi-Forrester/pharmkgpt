30225523|t|Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome in the intensive care unit.
30225523|a|The streptococcal toxic shock syndrome is a severe complication associated with invasive infections by group A streptococci. In spite of medical progresses in the care of patients with septic shock during the last decades, this condition has remained associated with a high mortality. Early recognition and multidisciplinary management are key to the care of patients with streptococcal toxic shock syndrome, with intensive and appropriate intensive support of failing organs, rapid diagnosis of infectious source(s), and surgical management. The epidemiology and risk factors for streptococcal toxic shock syndrome remain to be better studied, including the possible causal role of exposure to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. In this review article, the authors review the current knowledge of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome and discuss the pathophysiology as well as its supportive and specific treatment.
