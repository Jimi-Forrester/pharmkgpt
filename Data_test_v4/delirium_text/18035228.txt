18035228|t|Evaluation of sleep disturbances in older adults.
18035228|a|Older patients are at risk for a variety of sleep disorders, ranging from insomnia to circadian rhythm disturbances. The clinical consequence of unremitting sleep disturbances in the elderly population often includes hypersomnolence and may result in disorientation, delirium, impaired intellect, disturbed cognition, psychomotor retardation, or increased risk of accidents and injury. These symptoms may compromise overall quality of life and create social and economic burdens for the health care system, as well as for the caregivers. The clinical assessment of aging patients who have sleep complaints involves an in-depth multidisciplinary approach.
