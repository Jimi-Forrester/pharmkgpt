32101122|t|Anti-Amyloid Aggregating Gold Nanoparticles: Can they Really be Translated from Bench to Bedside for Alzheimer's Disease Treatment?
32101122|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by deposition of amyloid-beta protein aggregates and an appropriate treatment strategy is urgently needed, as the number of diagnosed cases continues to increase. The management of AD and other brain-associated diseases is limited by the blood brain barrier and its selective control of drug passage. In fact, most of the promising drugs have restricted curative effects on AD owing to their lower bioavailability. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have emerged as attractive therapeutic agents and have distinctive properties that could contribute to the development of a novel treatment strategy for neurodegenerative disorders. In this review article, we attempt to identify promising ways of developing competent AD therapeutic agents from anti-amyloid aggregating AuNPs. Initially, we discuss the current status of anti-amyloid inhibitors, the abilities of AuNPs to inhibit amyloid aggregation, and mechanistic aspects, and then describe plausible modifications that could aid the translation of AuNP-based therapeutics into neuromedicines. The review highlights some interesting characteristics that might effectively bridge the gap between laboratory and bedside treatments.
