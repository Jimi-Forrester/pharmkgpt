27485706|a|Aberrant promoter methylation of multiple genes is associated with various diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). The goal of the present study was to determine whether dopamine receptor D4 (DRD4) promoter methylation is associated with AD. In the current study, the methylation levels of the DRD4 promoter were measured in 46 AD patients and 61 controls using bisulfite pyrosequencing technology. The results of the present study demonstrated that DRD4 promoter methylation was significantly higher in AD patients than in controls. A further breakdown analysis by gender revealed that there was a significant association of DRD4 promoter methylation with AD in males (23 patients and 45 controls). In conclusion, the results of the present study demonstrated that elevated DRD4 promoter methylation was associated with AD risk in males.
