33323410|a|The prevalence, presentation, and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) differ between men and women, although beta-amyloid (Abeta) deposition is a pathological hallmark of AD in both sexes. Abeta-induced activation of the neuronal glutamate receptor mGluR5 is linked to AD progression. However, we found that mGluR5 exhibits distinct sex-dependent profiles. Specifically, mGluR5 isolated from male mouse cortical and hippocampal tissues bound with high affinity to Abeta oligomers, whereas mGluR5 from female mice exhibited no such affinity. This sex-selective Abeta-mGluR5 interaction did not appear to depend on estrogen, but rather Abeta interaction with cellular prion protein (PrPC), which was detected only in male mouse brain homogenates. The ternary complex between mGluR5, Abeta oligomers, and PrPC was essential to elicit mGluR5-dependent pathological suppression of autophagy in primary neuronal cultures. Pharmacological inhibition of mGluR5 reactivated autophagy, mitigated Abeta pathology, and reversed cognitive decline in male APPswe/PS1DeltaE9 mice, but not in their female counterparts. Abeta oligomers also bound with high affinity to human mGluR5 isolated from postmortem donor male cortical brain tissue, but not that from female samples, suggesting that this mechanism may be relevant to patients. Our findings indicate that mGluR5 does not contribute to Abeta pathology in females, highlighting the complexity of mGluR5 pharmacology and Abeta signaling that supports the need for sex-specific stratification in clinical trials assessing AD therapeutics.
