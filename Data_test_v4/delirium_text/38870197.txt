38870197|a|PURPOSE: Patients with Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) commonly experience sleep-related issues and are susceptible to stress. Moreover, variatiaons in their vision are often linked to anxiety, stress and drowsiness, indicating that stress and sleep deprivation lead to a decline in vision, and vision improves when both are mitigated. The objective of this study was to investigate the utility of salivary biomarkers as biochemical indicators of anxiety and sleep deprivation in RP patients. METHODS: Seventy-eight RP patients and 34 healthy controls were included in this observational study. Anxiety and sleep-quality questionnaires, a complete ophthalmological exam for severity grading and, the collection of salivary samples from participants were assessed for participants. The activity of biomarkers was estimated by ELISA, and statistical analysis was performed to determine associations between the parameters. Associations between underlying psychological factors, grade of disease severity, and biomarkers activity were also examined. RESULTS: Fifty-two (67%) of patients had a severe RP, and 26 (33%) had a mild-moderate grade. Fifty-eight (58,9%) patients reported severe levels of anxiety and 18 (23.,1%) a high level. Forty-six (59%) patients obtained pathological values in sleep-quality questionaries and 43 (55.1%) in sleepiness. Patients with RP exhibited significant differences in testosterone, cortisol, sTNFalphaRII, sIgA and melatonin as compared to controls and patients with a mild-moderate and advanced stage of disease showed greater differences. In covariate analysis, patients with a severe anxiety level also showed greater differences in mean salivary cortisol, sTNFalphaRII and melatonin and male patients showed lower IgA levels than female. CONCLUSIONS: The present findings suggest that salivary biomarkers could be suitable non-invasive biochemical markers for the objective assessment of sleep deprivation and anxiety in RP patients. Further research is needed to characterize the effects of untreated negative psychological states and sleep deprivation on increased variability of vision and disease progression, if any.
