35054051|t|The Effects of Early Rehabilitation in the Intensive Care Unit for Patients with Severe COVID-19 Pneumonia: A Retrospective Cohort Study.
35054051|a|This retrospective cohort study aimed to examine the rehabilitation effect of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the intensive care unit (ICU) under mechanical ventilation and included ICU patients from a university hospital who received rehabilitation under ventilator control until 31 May 2021. Seven patients were included, and three of them died; thus, the results of the four survivors were examined. The rehabilitation program comprised the extremity range-of-motion training and sitting on the bed's edge. The Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score (median (25-75th percentiles)) at admission was 7.5 (5.75-8.5), and the activities of daily living (ADLs) were bedridden, the lowest in the Functional Independence Measure (FIM) and Barthel Index (BI) surveys. Data on the mean time to extubation, ICU length of stay, and ADLs improvement (FIM and BI) during ICU admission were obtained. Inferential analyses were not performed considering the small sample size. The mean time to extubation was 4.9 +- 1.1 days, and the ICU length of stay was 11.8 +- 5.0 days. DeltaFIM was 36.5 (28.0-40.5), and the DeltaBI was 22.5 (3.75-40.0). Moreover, no serious adverse events occurred in the patients during rehabilitation. Early mobilization of patients with COVID-19 may be useful in ADLs improvement during ICU stay.
