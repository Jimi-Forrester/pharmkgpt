32878281|a|Previous studies have shown that heart failure is associated with worse health-related quality of life (HRQoL). The existence of differences according to gender remains controversial. We studied 1028 consecutive outpatients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) from a multicentre cross-sectional descriptive study across Spain that assessed HRQoL using two questionnaires (KCCQ, Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire; and EQ-5D, EuroQoL 5 dimensions). The primary objective of the study was to describe differences in HRQoL between men and women in global scores and domains of health status of patients and explore gender differences and its interactions with heart failure related factors. In adjusted analysis women had lower scores in KCCQ overall summary scores when compared to men denoting worse HRQoL (54.7 +- 1.3 vs. 62.7 +- 0.8, p < 0.0001), and specifically got lower score in domains of symptom frequency, symptoms burden, physical limitation, quality of life and social limitation. No differences were found in domains of symptom stability and self-efficacy. Women also had lower scores on all items of EQ-5D (EQ-5D index 0.58 +- 0.01 vs. 0.67 +- 0.01, p < 0.0001). Finally, we analyzed interaction between gender and different clinical determinants regarding the presence of limitations in the 5Q-5D and overall summary score of KCCQ. Interestingly, there was no statistical significance for interaction for any variable. In conclusion, women with HFrEF have worse HRQoL compared to men. These differences do not appear to be mediated by clinical or biological factors classically associated with HRQoL nor with heart failure severity.
