35495781|a|Background: Alcohol use disorders (AUDs) are increasing in developing countries like India and it has high relapse rates. Locus of control (LOC) and impulsivity can be important predictors of relapse and knowledge about them can help in management of AUD. Method: Cross-sectional analytical study of 116 indoor patients in tertiary care hospital, between ages 18 and 65 years diagnosed as AUD according to DSM-5, after acute detoxification was done. For interview, a sociodemographic sheet, Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test, Drinking-Related Locus of Control Scale, and Barrett's Impulsiveness Scale 11 scale (Gujarati versions) were used. Patients with complicated withdrawal and any other comorbid organic brain conditions were excluded. The data were analyzed using SPSS version 25. Result: Total participants consisted of 65% middle-aged (35-50 years) rural inhabitants. Eighty-six-percent of patients were employed and around 80% were educated >5th standard. No association was found between sociodemographic variables and severity of alcohol use. Severity of alcohol use increased with more duration of alcohol consumption (P = 0.001). Patients being earlier aged for first intake of alcohol had a high external LOC (r = 0.209, P = 0.050). Patients with high external LOC (P = 0.003) and more impulsivity (P = 0.001) had more relapses (more numbers of attempts to quit alcohol). With increased external LOC (r = 0.315) and increased impulsivity (r = 0.716), severity of alcohol use also increased. As impulsivity increased, patients' LOC was found more toward external side (P = 0.007) (r = 0.345). Conclusion: External LOC and impulsivity have a strong association with alcohol use. Patients with high external LOC and more impulsivity had early age of first intake, severe alcohol use, and more duration of alcohol consumption.
