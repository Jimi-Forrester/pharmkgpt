37505148|a|To investigate the clinical effect of donepezil combined with hydrogen-oxygen mixture inhalation in the treatment of patients with Alzheimer disease (AD), a total of 273 AD patients admitted to our hospital from March 2018 to March 2022 were retrospectively analyzed and assigned into an observation group (n = 138) and a control group (n = 135) according to the different treatment that they received. The control group was treated with donepezil tablets, while the observation group was treated with donepezil tablets combined with hydrogen-oxygen mixture inhalation. The scores of mini-mental state examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognition, activity of daily living scale (ADL) and the P300 event-related potential were compared between the 2 groups. After treatment, MMSE score, MoCA score, and ADL score in both groups increased after treatment (P < .01), while the improvement in the observation group was more significant than that in the control group (P < .001 for MMSE, P = .003 for MoCA, and P = .013 for ADL). The scores of Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognition in the observation group decreased after treatment (P < .05), while the improvement in the observation group was more significant than that in the control group (P = .005). After treatment, the latency of P300 in both groups was shortened (P < .01), and the improvement in the observation group was more significant than that in the control group (P < .001). The amplitude of the observation group increased after treatment (P < .01), and the improvement of the observation group was significant than that of the control group (P = .007). The clinical efficacy of donepezil combined with hydrogen-oxygen mixture inhalation in the treatment of AD is better than that of donepezil alone, which is worthy of further study.
