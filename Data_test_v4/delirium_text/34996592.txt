34996592|t|High-resolution perioperative cerebral blood flow autoregulation measurement: a practical and feasible approach for widespread clinical monitoring.
34996592|a|A growing body of evidence demonstrates that excursions of BP below or above the limits of cerebral blood flow autoregulation are associated with complications in patients with neurological injury or for those undergoing cardiac surgery. Moreover, recent evidence suggests that maintaining MAP above the lower limit of cerebral autoregulation during cardiopulmonary bypass reduces the frequency of postoperative delirium and is associated with improved memory 1 month after surgery. Continuous measurement of BP in relation to cerebral autoregulation limits using a virtual patient monitoring platform processing near-infrared spectroscopy digital signals offers the hope of bringing this application to the bedside.
