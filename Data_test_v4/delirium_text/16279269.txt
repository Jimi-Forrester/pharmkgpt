16279269|t|Genetics and the Dutch Hypothesis.
16279269|a|BACKGROUND: Increasingly, molecular genetic techniques are being used to improve our understanding of a number of common late onset complex disorders, such as hypertension, Alzheimer's disease and noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus. Molecular genetic approaches have the potential to yield new information about disease pathogenesis that may be of great importance for the development of future treatments. AIMS: This review discusses the evidence for a genetic contribution to the development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and specifically focuses on the hypothesis that asthma and COPD share some pathogenic mechanisms as originally proposed in 1960 in a theory that has since become known as the Dutch Hypothesis. In particular we will review the evidence from molecular genetics, both in support of and against the theory.
