39664107|t|Diabetic Neuropathy Is Related to Rhinencephalon Degeneration in Adults With Type 1 Diabetes.
39664107|a|Aims: We aimed to assess neurodegenerative changes in the rhinencephalon via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and relate it to olfactory function and diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) in adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D). Materials and Methods: Individuals aged 18-65 with T1D duration over 10 years and control healthy subjects underwent olfactory assessment using Sniffin'Sticks and brain MRI to assess volumetric measurements of the olfactory bulbs and piriform cortex thickness. Results: 32 T1D (24 males) aged 43.5 years (IQR: 37.0-48), diabetes duration 24.5 years (IQR: 20.5-27.0), and A1C 7.95% (IQR: 7.4-8.4) were assessed. The control group consisted of 6 healthy adults (4 males) aged 41.0 years (IQR: 36.0-48.0). Significantly lower olfactory test results in TDI (threshold-differentiation-identification) (31.5 (IQR: 28.7-33.6) vs. 34.1 (IQR: 33.2-37.2), p = 0.02) were obtained in the T1D as compared to the controls. Summarized olfactory bulb (OB) volumes and thickness of the left pyriform cortex were significantly smaller in T1D than in controls (65.8 mm3 (IQR: 57.9-71.7) vs. 75.8 mm3 (IQR: 74.8-76.7); p = 0.0005 and 3.1 mm (IQR: 2.7-3.4) vs. 3.6 mm (IQR: 3.5-4.1); p =0.02). Patients with DPN had significantly smaller OB volumes than patients without DPN (58.1 mm3 (IQR: 54.0-70.9) vs. 69.8 mm3 (IQR: 65.0-72.2); p = 0.02). Tobacco smoking (beta: -7.89; p = 0.013) and DPN (beta:-7.02; p = 0.015) proved to be independent predictors of OB volume. Conclusions: In adults with a long history of T1D, olfactory function and structures are impaired. The presence of diabetic neuropathy and ongoing smoking addiction might be considered predictors of the degradation of rhinencephalon structures in people with T1D.
