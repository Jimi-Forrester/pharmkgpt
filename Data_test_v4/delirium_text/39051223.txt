39051223|t|Oxidative Stress Responses in Obese Individuals Undergoing Bariatric Surgery: Impact on Carcinogenesis.
39051223|a|Obesity is a big public health problem that claims several thousand lives every year. Bariatric surgery has arisen as a suitable procedure for treating obesity, particularly morbid obesity. Oxidative stress, genotoxicity, apoptosis, and inflammatory responses are recognized as the most important occurrences in carcinogenesis, as they actively contribute to the multistep process. This study aimed to briefly review the connection between oxidative stress, genotoxicity, apoptosis, and inflammation in obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery, focusing on its impact on carcinogenesis. Regarding oxidative stress, bariatric surgery may inhibit the synthesis of reactive oxygen species. Moreover, a significant reduction in the inflammatory status after weight loss surgery was not observed. Bariatric surgery prevents apoptosis in several tissues, but the maintenance of low body weight for long periods is mandatory for mitigating DNA damage. In conclusion, the association between bariatric surgery and cancer risk is still premature. However, further studies are yet needed to elucidate the real association between bariatric surgery and a reduced risk of cancer.
