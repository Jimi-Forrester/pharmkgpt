32454103|a|The pathogenesis of viral infections involves an immune response by cytokines, causing a deleterious effect on organ function, in addition to tissue destruction due to viral replication. Clinical symptoms and laboratory findings of the human coronavirus disease COVID-19, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS CoV-2, indicate cytokine involvement. Our laboratory showed that an experimental murine coronavirus (MHV-A59) can be transmitted into the brain by intranasal or intracerebral exposure and that neurovirulence is mediated by cytokine secretion. In this study we investigated which cells in the brain produce cytokines, thus functioning as the brain's innate immune system. Using tissue cultures of microglia, and clonal populations of astrocytes, we found that microglia and type I astrocytes (but not types II and III), produced pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to MHV-A59 infection. A molecularly closely related, non-encephalitic strain of the virus (MHV-2) caused in vitro infection, but without cytokine induction. Furthermore, immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry revealed that type I astrocytes and microglia have perivascular foot processes necessary for the formation of the perivascular glymphatic system, the anatomical site of the brain's innate immune system. Cytokine secretion by type I astrocytes and microglia, as part of the brain's glymphatic and innate immune system, contributes to the pathogenesis of an encephalitic coronavirus infection, and indicates the rationale for anti-cytokine therapies for COVID-19.
