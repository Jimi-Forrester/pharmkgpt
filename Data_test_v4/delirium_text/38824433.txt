38824433|a|INTRODUCTION: Familial Alzheimer's disease (fAD) is heterogeneous in terms of age at onset and clinical presentation. A greater understanding of the pathogenicity of fAD variants and how these contribute to heterogeneity will enhance our understanding of the mechanisms of AD more widely. METHODS: To determine the pathogenicity of the unclassified PSEN1 P436S mutation, we studied an expanded kindred of eight affected individuals, with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (two individuals), patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) models (two donors), and post-mortem histology (one donor). RESULTS: An autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance of fAD was seen, with an average age at symptom onset of 46 years and atypical features. iPSC models and post-mortem tissue supported high production of amyloid beta 43 (Abeta43). PSEN1 peptide maturation was unimpaired. DISCUSSION: We confirm that the P436S mutation in PSEN1 causes atypical fAD. The location of the mutation in the critical PSEN1 proline-alanine-leucine-proline (PALP) motif may explain the early age at onset despite appropriate protein maturation. HIGHLIGHTS: PSEN1 P436S mutations cause familial Alzheimer's disease. This mutation is associated with atypical clinical presentation. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and post-mortem studies support increased amyloid beta (Abeta43) production. Early age at onset highlights the importance of the PALP motif in PSEN1 function.
