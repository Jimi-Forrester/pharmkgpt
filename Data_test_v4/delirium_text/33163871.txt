33163871|t|A Rare Case with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Manifested by two Different Neurologic Entities; Guillain Barre Syndrome and Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome.
33163871|a|Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an immune-mediated, lifelong disease characterized by quite heterogeneous neuropsychiatric manifestations. Herewith, we report the first rare co-incidental case with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), Guillain Barre Syndrome (GBS), and (SLE). The coexistence of these neurological conditions in SLE patients could lead to delayed diagnosis and treatment due to this rare coalescence and clinical diversity. Currently, there are no specific, diagnostic radiological or laboratory biomarkers for neurological involvement in SLE. Awareness and, early recognition of neuropsychiatric involvements of the disease are important for timely appropriate treatment. Delayed treatment may cause permanent damage, poor prognosis, long term morbidity, and even death.
