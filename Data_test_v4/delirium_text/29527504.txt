29527504|a|Dementia due to Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease for which treatment strategies at an early stage are of great clinical importance. So far, there is still a lack of non-invasive diagnostic tools to sensitively detect AD in early stages and to predict individual disease progression. Magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) of the brain may be a promising novel tool. In this proof-of-concept study, we investigated whether multifrequency-MRE (MMRE) can detect differences in hippocampal stiffness between patients with clinical diagnosis of dementia due to AD and healthy controls (HC). Further, we analyzed if the combination of three MRI-derived parameters, i.e., hippocampal stiffness, hippocampal volume and mean diffusivity (MD), improves diagnostic accuracy. Diagnostic criteria for probable dementia due to AD were in line with the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria and were verified through history-taking (patient and informant), neuropsychological testing, routine blood results and routine MRI to exclude other medical causes of a cognitive decline. 21 AD patients and 21 HC (median age 75 years) underwent MMRE and structural MRI, from which hippocampal volume and MD were calculated. From the MMRE-images maps of the magnitude  G*  and phase angle phi of the complex shear modulus were reconstructed using multifrequency inversion. Median values of  G*  and phi were extracted within three regions of interest (hippocampus, thalamus and whole brain white matter). To test the predictive value of the main outcome parameters, we performed receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses. Hippocampal stiffness ( G* ) and viscosity (phi) were significantly lower in the patient group (both p < 0.001). ROC curve analyses showed an area under the curve (AUC) for   G*  of 0.81 [95%CI 0.68-0.94]; with sensitivity 86%, specificity 67% for cutoff at  G*  = 980 Pa) and for phi an AUC of 0.79 [95%CI 0.66-0.93]. In comparison, the AUC of MD and hippocampal volume were 0.83 [95%CI 0.71-0.95] and 0.86 [95%CI 0.74-0.97], respectively. A combined ROC curve of  G* , MD and hippocampal volume yielded a significantly improved AUC of 0.90 [95%CI 0.81-0.99]. In conclusion, we demonstrated reduced hippocampal stiffness and reduced hippocampal viscosity, as determined by MMRE, in patients with clinical diagnosis of dementia of the AD type. Diagnostic sensitivity was further improved by the combination with two other MRI-based hippocampal parameters. These findings motivate further investigation whether MMRE can detect decreased brain stiffness already in pre-dementia stages, and whether these changes predict cognitive decline.
