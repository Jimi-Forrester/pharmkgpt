33294401|a|Nutrient composition and light stress significantly affect the productivity of astaxanthin in Haemotococcus pluvialis. Hence, the present study aimed to investigate the effect of initial phosphate concentration and two distinct light regimes on astaxanthin accumulation in H. pluvialis. In the green stage, microalgae were cultivated in different initial phosphate concentrations under 2000 lx and a 12:12 h photoperiod. To initiate astaxanthin accumulation, an increased light intensity of 5000 lx was provided using two methods; (i) stepwise light stress, where a 12:12 h photoperiod was provided for 14 days, followed by 14 days of continuous illumination, and (ii) continuous illumination for 28 days. Phosphate limitation and continuous light stress were favourable to enhance cellular astaxanthin accumulation, which reached 7% by weight. The highest astaxanthin concentration of 27.0 +- 1.9 mg/L and lowest specific light energy consumption of 32.9 +- 2.3 kW h/g astaxanthin were reported in cultures grown in 41 mg/L phosphate under continuous light stress.
