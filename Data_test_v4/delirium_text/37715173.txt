37715173|a|BACKGROUND: Most patients with hip fractures are elderly patients with comorbidities, and well-managed pain management is associated with positive postoperative outcomes. In recent years, new indications for regional anesthesia techniques have been defined, and they have found more place in clinical practice. Herein we investigate the effect of US-guided PENG block on positioning pain and compare that effect to intravenous opioid in patients undergoing surgery under spinal anesthesia for hip fractures. Additionally, we sought to investigate the effect of PENG block on pain scores, opioid intake, time to first analgesic requirement, and quality of recovery within the first 24 h following surgery. METHODS: In this study, patients were divided into the PENG (n = 42) and control group (n = 42) one hour prior to surgery. A team who was blinded to the assigned groups, collected and evaluated all data such as spinal anesthesia positioning pain, postoperative pain, opioid requirement. RESULTS: Patients that underwent PENG had statistically significantly lower NRS scores after interventions, immediately before positioning, at positioning and at end of spinal anesthesia. Pain scores during positioning for spinal anesthesia were statistically significantly lower in the PENG group than in the control group (p < 0.001). Total morphine use over the first 24 h was extremely statistically significantly lower in the PENG group (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Positive outcomes of PENG block in patient positioning pain before spinal anesthesia, postoperative pain scores, and morphine consumption are consistent with similar studies. High patient satisfaction in patients who underwent PENG block contributes to the literature. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04871061.
