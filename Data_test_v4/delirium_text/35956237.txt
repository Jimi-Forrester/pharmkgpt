35956237|t|Factors Associated with and Prognosis Impact of Perceived Sleep Quality and Estimated Quantity in Patients Receiving Non-Invasive Ventilation for Acute Respiratory Failure.
35956237|a|Background. The objectives of this study were (1) to determine factors associated with impaired sleep and (2) to evaluate the relationship between impaired sleep and the outcome. Methods. Secondary analysis of a prospective observational cohort study in 54 intensive care units in France and Belgium. Sleep quality was quantified by the patients with a semi-quantitative scale. Results. Among the 389 patients included, 40% reported poor sleep during the first night in the ICU and the median (interquartile) total sleep time was 4 h (2-5). Factors independently associated with poor sleep quality were the SOFA score (odds ratio [OR] 0.90, p = 0.037), anxiety (OR 0.43, p = 0.001) and the presence of air leaks (OR 0.52, p = 0.013). Factors independently associated with short-estimated sleep duration (<4 h) were the SOFA score (1.13, p = 0.005), dyspnea on admission (1.13, p = 0.031) and the presence of air leaks (1.92, p = 0.008). Non-invasive ventilation failure was independently associated with poor sleep quality (OR 3.02, p = 0.021) and short sleep duration (OR 0.77, p = 0.001). Sleep quality and duration were not associated with an increase in mortality or length of stay. Conclusions. The sleep of patients with ARF requiring NIV is impaired and is associated with a high rate of NIV failure.
