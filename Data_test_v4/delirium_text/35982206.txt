35982206|t|Predictors of sedation period for critical illness patients focusing on early rehabilitation on the bed.
35982206|a|There are various interventions of rehabilitation on the bed, but these are time-consuming and cannot be performed for all patients. The purpose of this study was to identify the patients who require early mobilization based on the level of sedation. We retrospectively evaluated the data of patients who underwent physical therapy, ICU admission of > 48 h, and were discharged alive. Sedation was defined as using sedative drugs and a Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale score of < - 2. Multiple regression analysis was performed using sedation period as the objective variable, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and Spearman's rank correlation coefficient were performed. Of 462 patients admitted to the ICU, the data of 138 patients were analyzed. The Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and non-surgery and emergency surgery cases were extracted as significant factors. The ROC curve with a positive sedation period of more than 3 days revealed the SOFA cutoff score was 10. A significant positive correlation was found between sedation period and the initial day on early mobilization. High SOFA scores, non-surgery and emergency surgery cases may be indicators of early mobilization on the bed in the ICU.
