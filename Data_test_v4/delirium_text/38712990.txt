38712990|t|Characterizing the Oligomers Distribution along the Aggregation Pathway of Amyloid Abeta1-40 by NMR.
38712990|a|This study delves into the early aggregation process of the Abeta1-40 amyloid peptide, elucidating the associated oligomers distribution. Motivated by the acknowledged role of small oligomers in the neurotoxic damage linked to Alzheimer's disease, we present an experimental protocol for preparing 26-O-acyl isoAbeta1-40, a modified Abeta1-40 peptide facilitating rapid isomerization to the native amide form at neutral pH. This ensures seed-free solutions, minimizing experimental variability. Additionally, we demonstrate the efficacy of coupling NMR diffusion ordered spectroscopy (DOSY) with the Inverse Laplace Transform (ILT) reconstruction method, for effective characterization of early aggregation processes. This innovative approach efficiently maps oligomers distributions across a wide spectrum of initial peptide concentrations offering unique insights into the evolution of oligomers relative populations. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach assessing the impact of Epigallocathechin gallate, a known remodeling agent of amyloid fibrils, on the oligomeric distributions of aggregated Abeta1-40. The DOSY-ILT proposed approach stands as a robust and discriminating asset, providing a powerful strategy for rapidly gaining insight into potential inhibitors' impact on the aggregation process.
