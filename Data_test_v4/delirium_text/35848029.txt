35848029|t|Correlation Between Plasma Oligomeric Amyloid-beta and Performance on the Language Neutral Visual Cognitive Assessment Test in a Southeast Asian Population.
35848029|a|Oligomeric amyloid-beta (OAbeta), an upstream driver of Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathology, correlates with poor cognitive performance and brain volume reduction. Its effect on cognitive performance measured by the language neutral Visual Cognitive Assessment Test (VCAT) remains to be evaluated. We studied the correlation of plasma OAbeta with VCAT scores and grey matter volume (GMV) in a Southeast Asian cohort with mild cognitive impairment. Higher plasma OAbeta significantly correlated with lower; cognitive scores (VCAT, Mini-Mental State Examination) and GMV/intracranial volume ratio. Such findings reveal the clinical utility of plasma OAbeta as a promising biomarker and support validation through longitudinal studies.
