34994340|t|Delivering mental healthcare to patients with a depressive disorder alongside a life-limiting illness.
34994340|a|The concurrent assessment and treatment of mental health disorders and palliative illnesses is complex. Affective disorders are more prevalent in people who need palliative care. Identifying the most suitable place of care and multi-professional multidisciplinary teams to provide support can be challenging and bewildering for professionals and patients. Mental health clinicians may be left with a sense of therapeutic nihilism, while palliative care teams can feel limited by the mental health resources available for treating those living with significant physical and mental health needs. We discuss the fictional case of a gentleman with metastatic bowel cancer who has developed symptoms of depressive disorder and identify how taking a pragmatic patient-centred approach can offer a route through potential dilemmas when seeking to provide individualised care based on needs. We used lay person experience alongside our own experiences of novel mechanisms for cross-specialty working in order to direct psychiatric trainees' approaches to such cases.
