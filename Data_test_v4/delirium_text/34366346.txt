34366346|a|BACKGROUND: Dominant missense mutations in the amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP) cause early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) and are associated with changes in the production or properties of the amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta), particularly of the 42-residue variant (Abeta42) that deposits in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain. Recent findings, however, show that FAD mutations in AbetaPP also lead to increased production of longer Abeta variants of 45-49 residues in length. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to test neurotoxicity of Abeta42 vis-a-vis longer variants, focusing specifically on mitochondrial function, as dysfunctional mitochondria are implicated in the pathogenesis of AD. METHODS: We generated SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells stably expressing AbetaPP mutations that lead to increased production of long Abeta peptides with or without Abeta42. These AbetaPP-expressing cells were tested for oxygen consumption rates (OCR) under different conditions designed to interrogate mitochondrial function. These cell lines were also examined for expression of genes important for mitochondrial or neuronal structure and function. RESULTS: The mutant AbetaPP-expressing cells showed decreased basal OCRs as well as decreased OCRs associated with mitochondrial ATP production, even more so in the absence of Abeta42 production. Moreover, mutant AbetaPP-expressing cells producing longer forms of Abeta displayed altered expression of certain mitochondrial- and neuronal-associated genes, whether or not Abeta42 was produced. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that mutant AbetaPP can cause mitochondrial dysfunction that is associated with long Abeta but not with Abeta42.
