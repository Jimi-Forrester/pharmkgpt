34933007|a|OBJECTIVE: Hyperglycemia leads to lipid peroxidation, producing 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE) adducts which correlate with the production of amyloid-beta (Abeta), one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study is to investigate the interactions of Abeta, HNE adducts and responding autoantibodies during the pathogenesis from hyperglycemia to AD. METHODS: A total of 239 Taiwanese serum samples from a healthy control group and patients with hyperglycemia, and AD with and without hyperglycemia were analyzed. Abeta was immunoprecipitated from randomly pooled serum in each group and immunoblotted. Synthetic Abeta1-16 and Abeta17-28 peptides were modified with HNE in vitro and verified with LC-MS/MS. The levels of Abeta, HNE adducts, and autoantibody isotypes IgG and IgM against either native or HNE-modified Abeta were determined with ELISA. The diagnostic power of potential biomarkers was evaluated. RESULTS: Increased fasting glucose and decreased high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol in AD groups indicated abnormal metabolism in the pathogenesis progression from hyperglycemia to AD. Indeed, serum Abeta, HNE adducts and most of the autoantibodies recognizing either native or HNE-modified Abeta were increased in the diseased groups. However, HNE adducts had better diagnostic performances than Abeta for both hyperglycemia and AD. Additionally, HNE-Abeta peptide levels were increased, and the responding autoantibodies (most notably IgM) were decreased in hyperglycemic AD group compared to the hyperglycemia only group, suggesting an immunity disturbance in the pathogenesis progression from hyperglycemia to AD. CONCLUSION: Hyperglycemia increases the level of HNE adducts which may be neutralized by responding autoantibodies. Depletion of these autoantibodies promotes AD-like pathogenesis. Thus, levels of a patient's HNE adducts and associated responding autoantibodies are potential biomarkers for AD with diabetes.
