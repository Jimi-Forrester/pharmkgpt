37561556|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an insidious and progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. Although the pathogenesis remains obscure, there are two dominant causal hypotheses. Since last three decades, amyloid beta (Abeta) deposition was the most prominent hypothesis, and the other is the tau hyperphosphorylation hypothesis. The confirmed diagnostic criterion for AD is the presence of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) composed of hyperphosphorylated tau and the deposition of toxic oligomeric Abeta in the autopsied brain. Consistent with these hypotheses, oxidative stress (OS) is garnering major attention in AD research. OS results from an imbalance of pro-oxidants and antioxidants. There is a considerable debate in the scientific community on which process occurs first, OS or plaque deposition/tau hyperphosphorylation. Based on recent scientific observations of various laboratories including ours along with critical analysis of those information, we believe that OS is the early event that leads to oligomeric Abeta deposition as well as dimerization of tau protein and its subsequent hyperphosphorylation. This OS hypothesis immediately suggests the consideration of novel therapeutic approaches to include antioxidants involving glutathione enrichment in the brain by supplementation with or without an iron chelator.
