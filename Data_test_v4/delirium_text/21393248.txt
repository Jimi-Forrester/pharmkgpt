21393248|a|The prion protein (PrP) is best known for its association with prion diseases. However, a controversial new role for PrP in Alzheimer disease (AD) has recently emerged. In vitro studies and mouse models of AD suggest that PrP may be involved in AD pathogenesis through a highly specific interaction with amyloid-beta (Abeta42) oligomers. Immobilized recombinant human PrP (huPrP) also exhibited high affinity and specificity for Abeta42 oligomers. Here we report the novel finding that aggregated forms of huPrP and Abeta42 are co-purified from AD brain extracts. Moreover, an anti-PrP antibody and an agent that specifically binds to insoluble PrP (iPrP) co-precipitate insoluble Abeta from human AD brain. Finally, using peptide membrane arrays of 99 13-mer peptides that span the entire sequence of mature huPrP, two distinct types of Abeta binding sites on huPrP are identified in vitro. One specifically binds to Abeta42 and the other binds to both Abeta42 and Abeta40. Notably, Abeta42-specific binding sites are localized predominantly in the octapeptide repeat region, whereas sites that bind both Abeta40 and Abeta42 are mainly in the extreme N-terminal or C-terminal domains of PrP. Our study suggests that iPrP is the major PrP species that interacts with insoluble Abeta42 in vivo. Although this work indicated the interaction of Abeta42 with huPrP in the AD brain, the pathophysiological relevance of the iPrP/Abeta42 interaction remains to be established.
