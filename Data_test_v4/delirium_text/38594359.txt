38594359|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) and post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) are the leading causes of progressive dementia related to neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular injuries in elderly populations. Despite decades of research, patients with these conditions still lack minimally invasive, low-cost, and effective diagnostic and treatment methods. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play a vital role in AD and PSCI pathology. As they are easily obtained from patients, miRNAs are promising candidates for the diagnosis and treatment of these two disorders. In this study, we performed complete sequencing analysis of miRNAs from 24 participants, split evenly into the PSCI, post-stroke non-cognitive impairment (PSNCI), AD, and normal control (NC) groups. To screen for differentially expressed miRNAs (DE-miRNAs) in patients, we predicted their target genes using bioinformatics analysis. Our analyses identified miRNAs that can distinguish between the investigated disorders; several of them were novel and never previously reported. Their target genes play key roles in multiple signaling pathways that have potential to be modified as a clinical treatment. In conclusion, our study demonstrates the potential of miRNAs and their key target genes in disease management. Further in-depth investigations with larger sample sizes will contribute to the development of precise treatments for AD and PSCI.
