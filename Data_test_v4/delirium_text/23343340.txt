23343340|a|Population estimates projects a significant increase in the geriatric population making elderly trauma patients more common. The geriatric trauma patients experience higher incidence of pre-existing medical conditions, impaired age-dependent physiologic reserve, use potent drugs and suffer from trauma system related shortcomings that influence outcomes.

Decision-makers should make system revisions and introduce advanced point-of-care initiatives to improve outcome after trauma for the elderly.
