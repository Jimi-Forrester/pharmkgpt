22146675|t|Year in review 2010: Critical Care--Neurocritical care.
22146675|a|In 2010 Critical Care published a large number of articles on critical care aspects of neurologic and neurosurgical conditions. These aspects included investigation of diagnostic criteria for bacterial meningitis, critical illness myopathy and their relationship to systemic inflammation. A number of studies investigated the biology of sepsis-related delirium, its biomarkers, its relationship to inflammation and its impact on outcome. Other teams reported on the use of magnetic resonance imaging, biomarkers and electroencephalogram to predict outcome in patients who were comatose following cardiac arrest. Our understanding of the pathophysiology as well as management of subarachnoid hemorrhage was addressed in several papers. Topics included the effect of hemodynamic treatment of delayed cerebral ischemia, pulmonary edema and the impact of subarachnoid hemorrhage on endocrine function. Finally, outcome from neurocritical care and patients' retrospective willingness to consent to the treatment they received were reported.
