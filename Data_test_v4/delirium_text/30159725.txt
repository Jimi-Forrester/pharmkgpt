30159725|t|Gradient impact of cognitive decline in unilateral vestibular hypofunction after rehabilitation: preliminary findings.
30159725|a|PURPOSE: Considering recent advances in central cognitive- and age-related processing interfering with balance and sensory reweighting in uncompensated vestibular disorders, purpose of this study is to highlight the vestibular rehabilitation (VR) outcomes in a population of older adults and age-matched mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients, both affected by unilateral vestibular hypofunction (UVH) and undergoing VR. METHODS: Vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR), postural sway examination (respectively, performed by video head impulse test and static posturography) and dizziness-related and quality-of-life scores were collected in 12 UVH MCI individuals >= 55 years and 12 matched UVH older adults with age-appropriate cognitive function-cognitively evaluated by means of Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-before and after a VR protocol. RESULTS: A significant post-treatment reduction in surface, length and power spectra (PS) values within low-frequency domain and an improvement in performance measures were recorded in both groups. Moreover, the VR protocol highlighted-when comparing pre-/post-treatment differences (Delta)-a significant (i) increase in Delta VOR gain; (ii) decrease in Delta surface and length and (iii) increase in Delta PS within low-frequency domain in older adults when compared to MCI patients. Positive correlations were found between MMSE and Delta Dynamic Gait Index, Delta surface and Delta PS within low-frequency domain when treating patients as 'a continuum' along the cognitive decline. CONCLUSIONS: Present pilot findings suggest that the cognitive domain insight in older adults scheduled for VR protocols may positively impact on disability consequences.
