36900638|t|Real-World Analysis on the Characteristics, Therapeutic Paths and Economic Burden for Patients Treated for Glaucoma in Italy.
36900638|a|This real-world analysis was performed on administrative databases to evaluate characteristics, therapies, and related economic burden of glaucoma in Italy. Adults with at least 1 prescription for ophthalmic drops (ATC class S01E: antiglaucoma preparations, miotics) during data availability period (January 2010-June 2021) were screened, then patients with glaucoma were included. First date of ophthalmic drops prescription was the index date. Included patients had at least 12 months of data availability before index-date and afterwards. Overall, 18,161 glaucoma-treated patients were identified. The most frequent comorbidities were hypertension (60.2%), dyslipidemia (29.7%) and diabetes (17%). During available period, 70% (N = 12,754) had a second-line therapy and 57% (N = 10,394) a third-line therapy, predominantly ophthalmic drugs. As first-line, besides 96.3% patients with ophthalmic drops, a small proportion reported trabeculectomy (3.5%) or trabeculoplasty (0.4%). Adherence to ophthalmic drops was found in 58.3% patients and therapy persistence reached 78.1%. Mean total annual cost per patient was $1,725, mostly due to all-cause drug expenditure ($800), all-cause hospitalizations ($567) and outpatient services ($359). In conclusion, glaucoma-treated patients were mostly in monotherapy ophthalmic medications, with an unsatisfying adherence and persistence (<80%). Drug expenditures were the weightiest item among healthcare costs. These real-life data suggest that further efforts are needed to optimize glaucoma management.
