33924986|a|In this review, the most important neuropathological changes found in the cerebella of sheep affected by classical natural scrapie are discussed. This disease is the oldest known of a group of unconventional "infections" caused by toxic prions of different origins. Scrapie is currently considered a "transmissible spongiform encephalopathy" (due to its neuropathological characteristics and its transmission), which is the paradigm of prion pathologies as well as many encephalopathies (prion-like) that present aberrant deposits of insoluble protein with neurotoxic effects due to errors in their catabolization ("misfolding protein diseases"). The study of this disease is, therefore, of great relevance. Our work data from the authors' previous publications as well as other research in the field. The four most important types of neuropathological changes are neuron abnormalities and loss, neurogliosis, tissue vacuolization (spongiosis) and pathological or abnormal prion protein (PrP) deposits/deposition. These findings were analyzed and compared to other neuropathologies. Various aspects related to the presentation and progression of the disease, the involution of different neuronal types, the neuroglial responses and the appearance of abnormal PrP deposits are discussed. The most important points of controversy in scrapie neuropathology are presented.
