The intestinal flora likely regulates cognitive function, but studies on cognitive impairment and intestinal flora in MHD patients are lacking. METHODS: MHD patients (36) and healthy volunteers (18) were evaluated using the Montreal Cognitive Function Scale, basic clinical data, and 16S ribosome DNA (rDNA) sequencing. Twenty MHD patients and ten healthy volunteers were randomly selected for shotgun metagenomic analysis to explore potential metabolic pathways of intestinal flora. Both16S rDNA sequencing and shotgun metagenomic sequencing were conducted on fecal samples. RESULTS: Roseburia were significantly reduced in the MHD group based on both 16S rDNA and shotgun metagenomic sequencing analyses. Faecalibacterium, Megamonas, Bifidobacterium, Parabacteroides, Collinsella, Tyzzerella, and Phascolarctobacterium were positively correlated with cognitive function or cognitive domains. Enriched Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways included oxidative phosphorylation, photosynthesis, retrograde endocannabinoid signaling, flagellar assembly, and riboflavin metabolism. CONCLUSION: Among the microbiota, Roseburia may be important in MHD patients. We demonstrated a correlation between bacterial genera and cognitive function, and propose possible mechanisms.
