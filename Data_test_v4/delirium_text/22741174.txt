22741174|a|Naringin, a bioflavonoid, has been reported to have potent neuro-protective effects, but its preventive effects on amyloid-beta (Abeta) induced, Alzheimer's disease (AD) related, cognitive impairment, and the underlying mechanisms of these effects have not been well characterised. Three-month-old APPswe/PSDeltaE9 transgenic mice were randomly assigned to a vehicle group, two naringin (either 50 or 100 mg/kg/day) groups, or an Aricept (2 mg/kg/day) group. After 16 weeks of treatment, we observed beneficial effects of naringin (100 mg/kg/day), including lessening learning and memory deficits, improving locomotor activity, reducing scattered senile plaques, and ameliorating disturbances in brain energy metabolism. Furthermore, GSK-3beta phosphorylation significantly increased in the naringin-treated (100 mg/kg/day) group. These findings suggest that a reduction in plaque burden and an increase in glucose uptake through the inhibition of GSK-3beta activity may be one of the mechanisms by which naringin improves cognitive functioning in the APPswe/ PSDeltaE9 transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
