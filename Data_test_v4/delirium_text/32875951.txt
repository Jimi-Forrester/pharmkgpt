32875951|t|Structure, regulatory factors and cancer-related physiological effects of ADAM9.
32875951|a|The ADAMs family belongs to the transmembrane protein superfamily of zinc-dependent metalloproteases, which consists of multiple domains. These domains have independent but complementary functions that enable them to participate in multiple biological processes. Among them, ADAM9 can not only participate in the degradation of extracellular matrix as a metalloprotease, but also mediate tumor cell adhesion through its deintegrin domain, which is closely related to tumor invasion and metastasis. It is widely expressed in a variety of tumor cells and can affect the proliferation, invasion and metastasis of related cancer cells. We provide our views on current progress, its increasing importance as a strategic treatment goal, and our vision for the future of ADAM9.
