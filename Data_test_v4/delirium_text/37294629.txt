37294629|a|The detection of site-specific phosphorylation in the microtubule-associated protein tau is emerging as a means to diagnose and monitor the progression of Alzheimer's Disease and other neurodegenerative diseases. However, there is a lack of phospho-specific monoclonal antibodies and limited validation of their binding specificity. Here, we report a novel approach using yeast biopanning against synthetic peptides containing site-specific phosphorylations. Using yeast cells displaying a previously validated phospho-tau (p-tau) single-chain variable region fragment (scFv), we show selective yeast cell binding based on single amino acid phosphorylation on the antigen. We identify conditions that allow phospho-specific biopanning using scFvs with a wide range of affinities (KD = 0.2 to 60 nM). Finally, we demonstrate the capability of screening large libraries by performing biopanning in 6-well plates. These results show that biopanning can effectively select yeast cells based on phospho-site specific antibody binding, opening doors for the facile identification of high-quality monoclonal antibodies.
