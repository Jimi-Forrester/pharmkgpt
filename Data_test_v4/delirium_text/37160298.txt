37160298|a|Menopause is one the most crucial stages in a female's life. Identifying the education gaps regarding menopause is important, thus this study aims to explain the health-related needs of females during menopause. Scopus, PubMed, Scientific Information Database, and Web of Science databases were searched for the available observational (cohort, case-control, and cross-sectional), systematic review, meta-analysis, and clinical trial studies (2007-2021) using keywords, such as 'Educational Needs Assessment,' 'Assessment of Healthcare Needs,' 'menopause,' 'climacteric,' 'premenopause,' and 'postmenopause.' A total of 180 out of 5,705 papers were evaluated after considering the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The educational needs of females during menopause in the reviewed studies include osteoporosis, oral and dental problems, metabolic disorders, cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, lung diseases, infectious diseases, musculoskeletal problems, urinary problems, breast cancer, defecation problems, genital disorders, special diseases such as eye diseases and hypothyroidism and hormone therapy, mental disorders, cognitive function, sleep disorders, sexual disorders, physical activity, supplement consumption, public health issues, health education, fall, and nutrition. The study results reveal that females during postmenopause require training, counseling, and support in all aspects to get through this challenging time, and providing these services, infrastructure, appropriate policy, and the use and support of the medical team's capacity are all required.
