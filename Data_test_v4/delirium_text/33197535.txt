33197535|a|BACKGROUND: Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) is a common pathophysiological mechanism in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia. The orphan nuclear receptor TLX plays an important role in neural development, adult neurogenesis and cognition. The aim of this study was to investigate the neuroprotective effects of TLX on cognitive dysfunction, hippocampal neurogenesis and neuroinflammation in a rat model of CCH and to assess the possible mechanisms. METHODS: Permanent bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (2-VO) was used to establish a model of CCH. Stereotaxic injection of an adeno-associated virus vector expressing TLX was used to overexpress TLX in the hippocampus. Cognitive function was evaluated by the Morris Water Maze test. Immunofluorescent staining was used to assess hippocampal neurogenesis. The effects of overexpression of TLX on SIRT1 and inflammatory cytokines were analyzed with qRT-PCR and western blot. RESULT: After 2-VO, CCH rats exhibited cognitive impairment and reduction of hippocampal TLX levels. Overexpression of TLX ameliorated cognitive impairments with increasing number of BrdU + cells and BrdU + NeuN + cells in DG. Furthermore, TLX rescued the reduced SIRT1 usually induced by CCH. Additionally, TLX also inhibited the expression of inflammatory cytokines such as NF-kappaB and IL-1beta. CONCLUSIONS: The present findings suggested that TLX exerted protective effects against cognitive deficits induced by CCH. The possible mechanisms of TLX may be through regulating the SIRT1/NF-kappaB pathway, promoting hippocampal neurogenesis and inhibiting the neuroinflammatory response.
