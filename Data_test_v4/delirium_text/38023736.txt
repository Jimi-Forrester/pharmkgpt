38023736|t|Protein Expression and Bioinformatics Study of Granulosa Cells of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Expressed Under the Influence of DHEA.
38023736|a|Background: The reproductive system is heavily dependent on ovarian follicles, which are made up of germ cells (oocytes) and granulosa cells (GCs), including cumulus granulosa cells (CGCs) and mural granulosa cells (MGCs). Understanding their normal and steroid-induced functions is the key to understanding the pathophysiology of endocrinal diseases in women. Objective: This study investigated the differentially expressed proteins by CGCs and MGCs of patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) and without subsequent exposure to dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) and functional differentiation. Design: The present study was observational and experimental study carried out in hospital involving 80 female patients undergoing IVF for infertility. Methods: In this study, we isolated CGCs and MGCs from the follicular fluid of both PCOS and non-PCOS patients undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF). The cells were cultured and treated with DHEAS for 48 hours, and these cells were extracted, digested, and analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry followed by processing of the results using open-source bioinformatics tools. Results: The present investigation discovered 276 and 341 proteins in CGCs and MGCs, respectively. DHEAS reduced the number of proteins expressed by CGCs and MGCs to 34 and 57 from 91 and 94, respectively. Venn results of CGCs revealed 49, 53, 36, and 21 proteins in normal CGCs, PCOS-CGCs, post-DHEAS, and PCOS-CGCs, respectively. Venn analysis of MGCs showed 51 proteins specific to PCOS and 29 shared by normal and PCOS samples after DHEAS therapy. MGCs express the most binding and catalytic proteins, whereas CGCs express transporter-related proteins. A protein pathway study demonstrated considerable differences between normal and PCOS samples, while DHEAS-treated samples of both cell lines showed distinct pathways. String findings identified important network route components such as albumin, actin, apolipoprotein, complement component C3, and heat shock protein. Conclusion: This is the first study to show how DHEAS-induced stress affects the expression of proteins by MGCs and CGCs isolated from normal and PCOS patients. Further studies are recommended to identify PCOS biomarkers from CGCs and MGCs expressed under the influence of DHEAS.
