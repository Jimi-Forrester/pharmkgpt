35434278|a|Epileptogenesis is a complex and not well understood phenomenon. Here, we explore the hypothesis that epileptogenesis could be "hijacking" normal memory processes, and how this hypothesis may provide new directions for epilepsy treatment. First, we review similarities between the hypersynchronous circuits observed in epilepsy and memory consolidation processes involved in strengthening neuronal connections. Next, we describe the kindling model of seizures and its relation to long-term potentiation model of synaptic plasticity. We also examine how the strengthening of epileptic circuits is facilitated during the physiological slow wave sleep, similarly as episodic memories. Furthermore, we present studies showing that specific memories can directly trigger reflex seizures. The neuronal hypersynchrony in early stages of Alzheimer's disease, and the use of anti-epileptic drugs to improve the cognitive symptoms in this disease also suggests a connection between memory systems and epilepsy. Given the commonalities between memory processes and epilepsy, we propose that therapies for memory disorders might provide new avenues for treatment of epileptic patients.
