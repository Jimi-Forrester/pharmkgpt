23983974|t|Olanzapine long-acting injection: insights from an early case series in the UK.
23983974|a|OBJECTIVE: Olanzapine long-acting injection depot (OLAI) has been licensed in the UK since 2008. As a result of the recognition during clinical trials that in 0.07% of injections there may be inadvertent intravenous administration leading to post-injection delirium/sedation syndrome (PDSS), the licence mandates a 3 h observation after each injection and accompaniment of the patient to their final destination. The administration of OLAI may thus necessitate organization of local service provisions. We report on how a single healthcare facility in Northern Ireland has treated three initial patients and present a brief case series on these patients and their clinical outcomes. METHODS: In the first three patients with schizophrenia to receive OLAI, the clinical notes were retrospectively examined to provide clinical data. RESULTS: All three patients had acceptable clinical outcomes showing sustained clinical improvement and have continued on OLAI for over 1 year. Observation has been undertaken within an existing daycare unit staffed by nursing staff and occupational therapists for 3 h after each injection. No issues have emerged from the use of this service that has also provided educational and psycho-educational programmes for the patients. No cases of post-injection delirium/sedation syndrome were reported. There have been no additional cost implications. CONCLUSIONS: In patients for whom OLAI may be clinically indicated, the utilization of an existing service to provide the 3 h of observation after each injection may represent a solution with a cost-neutral outcome.
