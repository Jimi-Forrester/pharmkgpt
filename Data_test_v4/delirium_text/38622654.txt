38622654|a|The neuroinflammatory process in synucleinopathies of the aging population such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) involves microglial activation as well as infiltration of the CNS by T cells and natural killer T cells (NKTs). To evaluate the potential of targeting NKT cells to modulate neuroinflammation, we treated alpha-syn transgenic (tg) mice (e.g.: Thy1 promoter line 61) with an antibody against CD1d, which is a glycoprotein expressed in antigen presenting cells (APCs). CD1d-presented lipid antigens activate NKT cells through the interaction with T cell receptor in NKTs, resulting in the production of cytokines. Thus, we hypothesized that blocking the APC-NKT interaction with an anti-CD1d antibody might reduce neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in models of DLB/PD. Treatment with the anti-CD1d antibody did not have effects on CD3 (T cells), slightly decreased CD4 and increased CD8 lymphocytes in the mice. Moreover, double labeling studies showed that compared to control (IgG) treated alpha-syn tg mice, treatment with anti-CD1d decreased numbers of CD3/interferon gamma (IFN gamma)-positive cells, consistent with NKTs. Further double labeling studies showed that CD1d-positive cells co-localized with the astrocytes marker GFAP and that anti-CD1d antibody reduced this effect. While in control alpha-syn tg mice CD3 positive cells were near astrocytes, this was modified by the treatment with the CD1d antibody. By qPCR, levels of IFN gamma, CCL4, and interleukin-6 were increased in the IgG treated alpha-syn tg mice. Treatment with CD1d antibody blunted this cytokine response that was associated with reduced astrocytosis and microgliosis in the CNS of the alpha-syn tg mice treated with CD1d antibody. Flow cytometric analysis of immune cells in alpha-syn tg mice revealed that CD1d-tet + T cells were also increased in the spleen of alpha-syn tg mice, which treatment with the CD1d antibody reduced. Reduced neuroinflammation in the anti-CD1d-treated alpha-syn tg mice was associated with amelioration of neurodegenerative pathology. These results suggest that reducing infiltration of NKT cells with an antibody against CD1d might be a potential therapeutical approach for DLB/PD.
