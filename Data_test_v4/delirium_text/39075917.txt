39075917|a|Brain-derived neurotrophic factor is a crucial neurotrophic factor that plays a significant role in brain health. Although the vast majority of meta-analyses have confirmed that exercise interventions can increase brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels in children and adolescents, the effects of specific types of exercise on brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels are still controversial. To address this issue, we used meta-analytic methods to quantitatively evaluate, analyze, and integrate relevant studies. Our goals were to formulate general conclusions regarding the use of exercise interventions, explore the physiological mechanisms by which exercise improves brain health and cognitive ability in children and adolescents, and provide a reliable foundation for follow-up research. We used the PubMed, Web of Science, Science Direct, Springer, Wiley Online Library, Weipu, Wanfang, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure databases to search for randomized controlled trials examining the influences of exercise interventions on brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels in children and adolescents. The extracted data were analyzed using ReviewManager 5.3. According to the inclusion criteria, we assessed randomized controlled trials in which the samples were mainly children and adolescents, and the outcome indicators were measured before and after the intervention. We excluded animal experiments, studies that lacked a control group, and those that did not report quantitative results. The mean difference (MD; before versus after intervention) was used to evaluate the effect of exercise on brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels in children and adolescents. Overall, 531 participants (60 children and 471 adolescents, 10.9-16.1 years) were included from 13 randomized controlled trials. Heterogeneity was evaluated using the Q statistic and I2 test provided by ReviewManager software. The meta-analysis showed that there was no heterogeneity among the studies (P = 0.67, I2 = 0.00%). The combined effect of the interventions was significant (MD = 2.88, 95% CI: 1.53-4.22, P < 0.0001), indicating that the brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels of the children and adolescents in the exercise group were significantly higher than those in the control group. In conclusion, different types of exercise interventions significantly increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels in children and adolescents. However, because of the small sample size of this meta-analysis, more high-quality research is needed to verify our conclusions. This meta-analysis was registered at PROSPERO (registration ID: CRD42023439408).
