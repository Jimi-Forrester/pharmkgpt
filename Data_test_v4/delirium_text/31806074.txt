31806074|t|Mortality of Alzheimer's Disease Patients: A 10-Year Follow-up Pilot Study in Shanghai.
31806074|a|BACKGROUND: Identifying risk factors and mortality of individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD) could have important implications for the clinical management of AD. OBJECTIVE: This pilot study aimed to examine the overall mortality of AD patients over a 10-year surveillance period in Shanghai, China. This study is an extension of our previous investigation on mortality of neurodegenerative diseases. METHODS: One hundred and thirty-two AD patients recruited from the memory clinics of two hospitals in Shanghai in 2007 were followed up until December 31, 2017 or death, representing a follow-up period of up to 10 years. Overall standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated, and predictors for survival at recruitment were estimated. RESULTS: Sixty-seven patients had died by December 31, 2017, and the SMR at 10 years of follow-up was 1.225 (95% confidence interval 0.944-1.563). Employing Cox's proportional hazard modeling, lower Mini-Mental State Examination score, and comorbid diabetes predicted poor survival in this cohort. CONCLUSION: This pilot study suggests a similar survival trend of patients with AD compared to the general population in Shanghai urban region. Poor cognitive status and comorbid diabetes had a negative impact on the survival of AD patients.
