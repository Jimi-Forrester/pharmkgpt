38863362|t|Sleep, anxiety, depression, and stress in critically ill patients: a descriptive study in a Portuguese intensive care unit.
38863362|a|BACKGROUND: Sleep disorders are common among patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs). This study aimed to assess the perceptions of sleep quality, anxiety, depression, and stress reported by ICU patients and the relationships between these perceptions and patient variables. METHODS: This cross-sectional study used consecutive non-probabilistic sampling to select participants. All patients admitted for more than 72 hours of ICU hospitalization at a Portuguese hospital between March and June 2020 were asked to complete the "Richard Campbell Sleep Questionnaire" and "Anxiety, depression, and Stress Assessment Questionnaire." The resulting data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Pearson's correlation coefficient, Student t-tests for independent samples, and analysis of variance. The significance level for rejecting the null hypothesis was set to alpha <=0.05. RESULTS: A total of 52 patients admitted to the ICU for at least 72 hours was recruited. The mean age of the participants was 64 years (standard deviation, 14.6); 32 (61.5%) of the participants were male. Approximately 19% had psychiatric disorders. The prevalence of self-reported poor sleep was higher in women (t[50]=2,147, P=0.037) and in participants with psychiatric problems, although this difference was not statistically significant (t[50]=-0.777, P=0.441). Those who reported having sleep disorders before hospitalization had a worse perception of their sleep. CONCLUSIONS: Sleep quality perception was worse in female ICU patients, those with psychiatric disorders, and those with sleep alterations before hospitalization. Implementing early interventions and designing nonpharmacological techniques to improve sleep quality of ICU patients is essential.
