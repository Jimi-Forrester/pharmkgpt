39262936|a|Menopause is a natural phase marked by the permanent cessation of menstrual cycles, occurring when the production of reproductive hormones from the ovaries stops for at least 12 consecutive months. Studies have suggested a potential connection between menopause and a heightened risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD), underscoring the significant role of reduced estrogen levels in the development of AD. Estrogen plays a crucial role in brain metabolism, influencing energy metabolism, synaptic plasticity, and cognitive functions. The cognitive benefits associated with hormone replacement therapy (HRT) are believed to be linked to estrogen's neuroprotective effects, either through direct action on the brain or indirectly by improving cardiovascular health. Extensive literature supports the positive impact of estrogen on brain cells. While the physiological effects of estrogen on the brain have not been consistently replicated in clinical trials, further research is crucial to provide more definitive recommendations to menopausal patients regarding the influence of HRT on AD. This review aims to comprehensively explore the interplay between menopause and AD, as well as the potential of HRT to mitigate cognitive decline in post-menopausal individuals.
