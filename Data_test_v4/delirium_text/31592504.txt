31592504|t|Cerebral Desaturation Events During Shoulder Arthroscopy in the Beach Chair Position.
31592504|a|The beach chair position (BCP) is commonly used position in upper extremity surgery. Although there are many advantages to surgery in this position, there are also potential drawbacks and described complications including devastating neurologic outcomes. The etiology of these complications is postulated to be due to the gravitational effects of the seated position leading to cerebral hypoperfusion. We review the current literature on intraoperative cerebral monitoring and neurocognitive complications with shoulder surgery performed in the BCP. A previous systematic review estimated the incidence of neurocognitive complications after surgery in the BCP to be 0.004%. However, the true incidence is unknown and is likely much more common. Reports of neurologic complications have revealed a need for heightened vigilance, alternative anesthesia techniques, and improved monitoring. Methods for monitoring have included near-infrared spectroscopy, a measurement of cerebral oximetry shown to reliably detect cerebral hypoperfusion. In this literature review, we sought to update the incidence of intraoperative cerebral desaturation events (CDEs) to investigate the relationship of CDEs to neurocognitive complications and to review recent reported cases of neurocognitive complications. Existing literature suggest that accurate intraoperative monitoring of cerebral perfusion may improve patient safety.
