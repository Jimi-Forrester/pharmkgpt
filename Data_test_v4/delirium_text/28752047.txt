28752047|t|Amyloid formation disrupts the balance between interleukin-1beta and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist in human islets.
28752047|a|OBJECTIVES: beta-cell dysfunction and apoptosis associated with islet inflammation play a key role in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Growing evidence suggests that islet amyloid, formed by aggregation of human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP), contributes to islet inflammation and beta-cell death in T2D. We recently showed the role of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta)/Fas/caspase-8 apoptotic pathway in amyloid-induced beta-cell death. In this study, we used human islets in culture as an ex vivo model of amyloid formation to: (1) investigate the effects of amyloid on islet levels of the natural IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra); (2) examine if modulating the IL-1beta/IL-1Ra balance can prevent amyloid-induced beta-cell Fas upregulation and apoptosis. METHODS: Isolated human islets (n = 10 donors) were cultured in elevated glucose (to form amyloid) with or without a neutralizing human IL-1beta antibody for up to 7 days. Parallel studies were performed with human islets in which amyloid formation was prevented by adeno-siRNA-mediated suppression of hIAPP expression (as control). beta-cell levels of IL-1Ra, Fas, apoptosis as well as islet function, insulin- and amyloid-positive areas, and IL-1Ra release were assessed. RESULTS: Progressive amyloid formation in human islets during culture was associated with alterations in IL-1Ra. Islet IL-1Ra levels were higher at early stages but were markedly reduced at later stages of amyloid formation. Furthermore, IL-1Ra release from human islets was reduced during 7-day culture in a time-dependent manner. These changes in IL-1Ra production and release from human islets during amyloid formation adversely correlated with islet IL-1beta levels, beta-cell Fas expression and apoptosis. Treatment with IL-1beta neutralizing antibody markedly reduced amyloid-induced beta-cell Fas expression and apoptosis, thereby improving islet beta-cell survival and function during culture. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that amyloid formation impairs the balance between IL-1beta and IL-1Ra in islets by increasing IL-1beta production and reducing IL-1Ra levels thereby promoting beta-cell dysfunction and death. Restoring the IL-1beta/IL-1Ra ratio may provide an effective strategy to protect islet beta-cells from amyloid toxicity in T2D.
