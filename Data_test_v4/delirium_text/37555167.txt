37555167|t|A unified framework for focal intensity change detection and deformable image registration. Application to the monitoring of multiple sclerosis lesions in longitudinal 3D brain MRI.
37555167|a|Registration is a crucial step in the design of automatic change detection methods dedicated to longitudinal brain MRI. Even small registration inaccuracies can significantly deteriorate the detection performance by introducing numerous spurious detections. Rigid or affine registration are usually considered to align baseline and follow-up scans, as a pre-processing step before applying a change detection method. In the context of multiple sclerosis, using deformable registration can be required to capture the complex deformations due to brain atrophy. However, non-rigid registration can alter the shape of appearing and evolving lesions while minimizing the dissimilarity between the two images. To overcome this issue, we consider registration and change detection as intertwined problems that should be solved jointly. To this end, we formulate these two separate tasks as a single optimization problem involving a unique energy that models their coupling. We focus on intensity-based change detection and registration, but the approach is versatile and could be extended to other modeling choices. We show experimentally on synthetic and real data that the proposed joint approach overcomes the limitations of the sequential scheme.
