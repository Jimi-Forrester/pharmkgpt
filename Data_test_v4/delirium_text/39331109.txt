39331109|a|Increasing evidence suggests a potential role for infectious pathogens in the etiology of synucleinopathies, a group of age-related neurodegenerative disorders including Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple system atrophy and dementia with Lewy bodies. In this review, we discuss the link between infections and synucleinopathies from a historical perspective, present emerging evidence that supports this link, and address current research challenges with a focus on neuroinflammation. Infectious pathogens can elicit a neuroinflammatory response and modulate genetic risk in PD and related synucleinopathies. The mechanisms of how infections might be linked with synucleinopathies as well as the overlap between the immune cellular pathways affected by virulent pathogens and disease-related genetic risk factors are discussed. Here, an important role for alpha-synuclein in the immune response against infections is emerging. Critical methodological and knowledge gaps are addressed, and we provide new future perspectives on how to address these gaps. Understanding how infections and neuroinflammation influence synucleinopathies will be essential for the development of early diagnostic tools and novel therapies.
