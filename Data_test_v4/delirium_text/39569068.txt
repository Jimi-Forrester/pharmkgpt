39569068|t|Synaptopodin: a key regulator of Hebbian plasticity.
39569068|a|Synaptopodin, an actin-associated protein found in a subset of dendritic spines in telencephalic neurons, has been described to influence both functional and morphological plasticity under various plasticity paradigms. Synaptopodin is necessary and sufficient for the formation of the spine apparatus, stacks of smooth endoplasmic reticulum cisternae. The spine apparatus is a calcium store that locally regulates calcium dynamics in response to different patterns of activity and is also thought to be a site for local protein synthesis. Synaptopodin is present in ~30% of telencephalic large dendritic spines in vivo and in vitro highlighting the heterogeneous microanatomy and molecular architecture of dendritic spines, an important but not well understood aspect of neuroplasticity. In recent years, it has become increasingly clear that synaptopodin is a formidable regulator of multiple mechanisms essential for learning and memory. In fact, synaptopodin appears to be the decisive factor that determines whether plasticity can occur, acting as a key regulator for synaptic changes. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of synaptopodin's role in various forms of Hebbian synaptic plasticity.
