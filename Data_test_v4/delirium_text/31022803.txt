31022803|t|Advice for Elderly Drivers in a German Memory Clinic: A Case Report on Medical, Ethical and Legal Consequences.
31022803|a|We report on a 75-year-old female who consulted our Memory Clinic because of subjective memory complaints that she first recognized three months previously. Next to the standard detailed patient history, neuropsychological assessment, psychopathological status, the patient's driving history played an important role in the diagnostic process. In this case report, we illustrate the diagnostic process starting with the first consultation, including a short neuropsychological examination and communicating its results, reporting on further work-up (detailed neuropsychological assessment, MRI scan and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis) up to the final consultation, including advice for the patient. We will focus on several medical, ethical and legal difficulties that may occur when consulting elderly drivers with initial cognitive decline.
