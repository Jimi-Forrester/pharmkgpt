38906341|t|Lecanemab demonstrates highly selective binding to Abeta protofibrils isolated from Alzheimer's disease brains.
38906341|a|Recent advances in immunotherapeutic approaches to the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) have increased the importance of understanding the exact binding preference of each amyloid-beta (Abeta) antibody employed, since this determines both efficacy and risk for potentially serious adverse events known as amyloid-related imaging abnormalities. Lecanemab is a humanized IgG1 antibody that was developed to target the soluble Abeta protofibril conformation. The present study prepared extracts of post mortem brain samples from AD patients and non-demented elderly controls, characterized the forms of Abeta present, and investigated their interactions with lecanemab. Brain tissue samples were homogenized and extracted using tris-buffered saline. Abeta levels and aggregation states in soluble and insoluble extracts, and in fractions prepared using size-exclusion chromatography or density gradient ultracentrifugation, were analyzed using combinations of immunoassay, immunoprecipitation (IP), and mass spectrometry. Lecanemab immunohistochemistry was also conducted in temporal cortex. The majority of temporal cortex Abeta (98 %) was in the insoluble extract. Abeta42 was the most abundant form present, particularly in AD subjects, and most soluble Abeta42 was in soluble aggregated protofibrillar structures. Abeta protofibril levels were much higher in AD subjects than in controls. Protofibrils captured by lecanemab-IP contained high levels of Abeta42 and lecanemab bound to large, medium, and small Abeta42 protofibrils in a concentration-dependent manner. Competitive IP showed that neither Abeta40 monomers nor Abeta40-enriched fibrils isolated from cerebral amyloid angiopathy reduced lecanemab's binding to Abeta42 protofibrils. Immunohistochemistry showed that lecanemab bound readily to Abeta plaques (diffuse and compact) and to intraneuronal Abeta in AD temporal cortex. Taken together, these findings indicate that while lecanemab binds to Abeta plaques, it preferentially targets soluble aggregated Abeta protofibrils. These are largely composed of Abeta42, and lecanemab binds less readily to the Abeta40-enriched fibrils found in the cerebral vasculature. This is a promising binding profile because Abeta42 protofibrils represent a key therapeutic target in AD, while a lack of binding to monomeric Abeta and cerebral amyloid deposits should reduce peripheral antibody sequestration and minimize risk for adverse events.
