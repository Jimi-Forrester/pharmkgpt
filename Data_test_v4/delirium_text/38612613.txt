38612613|t|The Immunometabolic Gene N-Acetylglucosamine Kinase Is Uniquely Involved in the Heritability of Multiple Sclerosis Severity.
38612613|a|The clinical severity of multiple sclerosis (MS), an autoimmune disorder of the central nervous system, is thought to be determined by environmental and genetic factors that have not yet been identified. In a recent genome-wide association study (GWAS), a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs10191329, has been associated with MS severity in two large independent cohorts of patients. Different approaches were followed by the authors to prioritize the genes that are transcriptionally regulated by such an SNP. It was concluded that the identified SNP regulates a group of proximal genes involved in brain resilience and cognitive abilities rather than immunity. Here, by conducting an alternative strategy for gene prioritization, we reached the opposite conclusion. According to our re-analysis, the main target of rs10191329 is N-Acetylglucosamine Kinase (NAGK), a metabolic gene recently shown to exert major immune functions via the regulation of the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2 (NOD2) pathway. To gain more insights into the immunometabolic functions of NAGK, we analyzed the currently known list of NAGK protein partners. We observed that NAGK integrates a dense network of human proteins that are involved in glucose metabolism and are highly expressed by classical monocytes. Our findings hold potentially major implications for the understanding of MS pathophysiology.
