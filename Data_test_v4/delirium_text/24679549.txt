24679549|t|The Model of Care Partner Engagement: use in delirium management.
24679549|a|Care partner engagement is a central tenant of person-centered care. Despite widespread interest in transforming current health care delivery to a more person-centered system, little is known about effective strategies for engaging care partners. The Model of Care Partner Engagement is introduced and described as an evidence-informed framework that nurses can use to guide the development of care partnerships. The case of hospitalized older adults with cognitive impairment and delirium is used to illustrate implementation of the model. Care partner engagement is integral to national efforts that promote affordable, equitable, high quality care and is a growing expectation of older adults and their families.
