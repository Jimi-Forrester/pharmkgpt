36457730|a|Background: Viral infection, including COVID-19, has been implicated as a potential cause of various neurobehavioral issues. An increasing number of case reports suggest that current or recent COVID-19 infection may cause new onset of psychotic symptoms in some individuals, potentially related to viral inflammation or infection of the nervous system. Case presentation: A 26-year-old woman with no psychiatric history presented with severe psychotic symptoms days after recovery from a mild COVID-19 infection. No other etiologies for psychosis were identified via diagnostic testing, review of medical history, or interviews with family. Her symptoms persisted for approximately two months, requiring three inpatient admissions, various medication trials, and ongoing outpatient follow-up. With continued use of quetiapine and lithium, she returned to living independently and working full-time, and discontinued all medication approximately nine months after symptom onset. Conclusion: The psychiatric and cognitive effects of COVID-19 infection are not yet fully understood. Given the widespread and ongoing nature of this pandemic, this remains an important focus of further investigation, especially within the context of potential long-term complications.
