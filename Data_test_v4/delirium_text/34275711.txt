34275711|a|Anterior tibiofemoral dislocation after total knee arthroplasty is an extremely rare and serious event. Amongst English-published papers, we found only 15 relevant cases, 3 of which presented vascular complications. This manuscript aims to present a 77-year-old woman with a TC-Plus (Smith & Nephew) cruciate-retaining type in first time of knee prosthesis, who suffered an anterior tibiofemoral dislocation and were admitted to our hospital. The clinical management and outcome were evaluated. Furthermore, a review of literature was performed. We concluded that early detection and surgical intervention of vascular injury is the key in the survival of the limbs. If there is still knee instability after acute recovery, it seems that revision surgery with constrained total knee arthroplasty can bring about good clinical and functional results.
