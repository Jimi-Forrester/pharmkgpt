34751345|a|BACKGROUND: The appropriate use of analgesia, sedation, neuromuscular blockade and the diagnosis and prevention of delirium (ASBD) are associated with better outcomes in critically ill patients at Intensive Care Unit (ICUs). AIM: To know the practices about analgesia, sedation, delirium, and neuromuscular blockade use among healthcare professionals working in adult ICUs in Chile. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An electronic survey was sent to 812 professionals working in ICUs using a previously published instrument, which was adapted and authorized by the author. RESULTS: We received 278 surveys. Fifty two percent of respondents were physicians, 34% nurses and 11% physical therapists. Their age ranged between 30 and 39 years in 43% and was over 50 years in 9%. Eighty four percent evaluated pain routinely, but only 26% use a validated scale. Sedation was routinely evaluated with a validated scale and 73% referred to have a protocol. Neuromuscular block is seldom used, and little monitoring occurs (43%). Delirium is routinely evaluated by 48% of respondents, usually using the CAM-ICU scale. CONCLUSIONS: There is a heterogeneous adherence to the ASBD recommended practices. The main gaps are in the assessment of pain, monitoring of neuromuscular blockade and diagnosis of delirium through validated instruments.
