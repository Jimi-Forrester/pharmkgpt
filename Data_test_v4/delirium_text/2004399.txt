2004399|a|The authors describe a simple method for the assessment of plasma vitamin A and E levels. It makes use of a modern analytical method--high performance liquid chromatography--(HPLC). The authors elaborated an optimal method of processing of samples and conditions for analysis suitable for routine estimations which were verified in different population groups (elderly population in old pensioners' homes, patients hospitalized with the diagnosis of delirium tremens, psychiatric patients with the diagnosis of tardive dyskinesia). The authors determined the reproducibility of the method--3.7% for alpha-tocopherol and 3.2% for retinol.--Assessment of plasma vitamin A and E levels by means of HPLC is a method suitable for routine analyses.
