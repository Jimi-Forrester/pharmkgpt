35178309|t|Post-COVID-19 Guillain-Barre Syndrome: A Case Report With Literature Review.
35178309|a|Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) predominantly affects the respiratory system with manifestations ranging from a mild upper respiratory tract infection to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. Neurological manifestations of COVID-19 are mainly thrombotic manifestations affecting the nervous system; however, demyelinating manifestation has been less defined. Although some recent studies have described the association between COVID-19 and Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS), the strength of association and features of GBS in this setting are not yet clear. Here, we report one adult case of COVID-19 infection presenting with acute GBS, which was not preceded by any other respiratory, gastrointestinal, or other systemic infections. We performed a literature search in Medline via PubMed using the keywords or MeSH terms "COVID-19" or "SARS-CoV-2" and "Guillain-Barre syndrome" and "AIDP" and "AMAN," "Miller-Fischer syndrome" or "MFS." We reviewed 99 case reports, 38 reviews, and two meta-analyses. Several published reports have described a possible association between GBS and COVID-19 infection.
