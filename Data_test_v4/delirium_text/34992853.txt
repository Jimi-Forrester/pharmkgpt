Here, we investigated whether natural products from Chrysophyllum perpulchrum as catechin and two dimeric procyanidins (catechin + hexose) could prevent progression of oxidative stress and cognitive changes using an AD-like rat model induced by Abeta1-40 injection into the hippocampal CA1 subfield. METHODOLOGY: Adult male Wistar rats were either microinjected with 1% ammonia as a vehicle (10 microL) or aggregated Abeta1-40 at 10 microg bilateral hippocampus. On the 14th day of post-surgery, some Abeta rats were treated with melatonin (10 mg/kg i.p.) or with the Chrysophyllum perpulchrum extract (300 mg/kg p.o.), and some sham-operated rats received the extract alone. Cognitive abilities were tested with Y-maze, object recognition test and Morris Water Maze. Oxidative stress markers as well as the level of activated microglial cells were assayed in the brain. RESULTS: Abeta rats exhibited significant deficits of recognition memory and spatial learning. This was associated with an increase of microglia Iba 1 immunoreactivity as well as nitric oxide (NO), malondialdehyde and superoxide dismutase levels but not to the thiol content in the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex and septum of AD-like rats. The Chrysophyllum perpulchrum extract treatment mitigated Abeta-induced cognitive impairments and reversed microglia overactivation and subsequent generation of oxidative stress markers. Interestingly, the neuroprotective actions of the Chrysophyllum perpulchrum extract seem to be comparable to the control drug melatonin used albeit with some more beneficial effects. CONCLUSION: These findings are preliminary and should be strengthened by more pharmacological studies of bioactive compounds of Chrysophyllum perpulchrum before being proposed as a promising drug against AD.
