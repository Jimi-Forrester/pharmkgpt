1780392|t|Changes in glucose metabolism in dementia of the Alzheimer type compared with depression: a preliminary report.
1780392|a|We evaluated positron emission tomography (PET) in the differential diagnosis of depression and Alzheimer's disease. The local cerebral metabolic rate for glucose (LCMRGlc) in the parahippocampal gyrus-hippocampus and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex were determined. The ratio of the LCMRGlc in those two regions was examined in patients with unipolar depression, bipolar depression, and Alzheimer's dementia. An analysis of variance revealed significant overall intergroup differences in values for both hemispheres. Student's t test showed significant differences in LCMRGlc for both unipolar and bipolar depression as compared with Alzheimer's dementia. These data indicate that PET may be useful in the differential diagnosis of dementia vs. depression.
