26238778|a|STUDY OBJECTIVE: Because delirium remains a common consequence of critical illness, and reducing its duration has been shown to have a positive impact on patient outcomes during and after an intensive care unit (ICU) stay, we sought to determine whether treatment of hypoactive delirium with quetiapine reduces the duration of delirium compared with no pharmacologic treatment. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Three medical-surgical ICUs within the two main campuses of an academic tertiary care hospital system. PATIENTS: A total of 113 adults with documented hypoactive delirium during an ICU length of stay (LOS) of at least 72 hours between August 2013 and September 2014; 52 patients received at least one dose of quetiapine during their hypoactive delirium course, and 61 patients received no pharmacologic delirium treatment. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Patients were screened for hypoactive delirium using the Confusion Assessment Method-ICU (CAM-ICU) and the Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS). The primary outcome was time to first resolution of delirium, and secondary outcomes included ICU and hospital LOS, and duration of mechanical ventilation. To assess potential adverse effects of quetiapine, the number of RASS assessments deeper than goal and the total number of RASS assessments documented during the delirium course were recorded for all patients. Daily progress notes and discharge documentation were surveyed to assess for new onset of extrapyramidal symptoms or torsade de pointes. Median duration of hypoactive delirium was shorter in the quetiapine-treated group compared with the no-quetiapine group (1.5 vs 2.0 days, p=0.04), and time to extubation after screening positive for delirium trended favorably toward quetiapine-treated patients (3 vs 5 days, p=0.08). There were no significant differences in ICU or hospital LOS, and safety outcomes were similar between groups. CONCLUSION: In this mixed ICU population, treatment of hypoactive delirium with quetiapine was safe and reduced the duration of delirium compared with standard care alone. Prospective placebo-controlled studies are needed to further assess the role of antipsychotics in hypoactive delirium.
