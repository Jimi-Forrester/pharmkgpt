38306040|a|Background: Mild behavioral impairment (MBI) is one of the earliest observable changes when a person experiences cognitive decline and could be an early manifestation of underlying Alzheimer's disease neuropathology. Limited attention has been given to investigating the clinical applicability of behavioral biomarkers for detection of prodromal dementia. Objective: This study compared the prevalence of self-reported MBI and vascular risk factors in Southeast Asian adults to identify early indicators of cognitive impairment and dementia. Methods: This cohort study utilized baseline data from the Biomarkers and Cognition Study, Singapore (BIOCIS). 607 participants were recruited and classified into three groups: cognitively normal (CN), subjective cognitive decline (SCD), and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Group comparisons of cognitive-behavioral, neuroimaging, and blood biomarkers data were applied using univariate analyses. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to investigate the association between cerebrovascular disease, vascular profiles, and cognitive impairment. Results: SCD had significantly higher depression scores and poorer quality of life (QOL) compared to CN. MCI had significantly higher depression scores; total MBI symptoms, MBI-interest, MBI-mood, and MBI-beliefs; poorer sleep quality; and poorer QOL compared to CN. Higher Staals scores, glucose levels, and systolic blood pressure were significantly associated with MCI classification. Fasting glucose levels were significantly correlated with depression, anxiety, MBI-social, and poorer sleep quality. Conclusions: The results reflect current research that behavioral changes are among the first symptoms noticeable to the person themselves as they begin to experience cognitive decline. Self-reported questionnaires may aid in early diagnoses of prodromal dementia. Behavioral changes and diabetes could be potential targets for preventative healthcare for dementia.
