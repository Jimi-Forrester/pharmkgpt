34747160|t|Managing agitation secondary to hyperactive delirium in deteriorating patients.
34747160|a|Delirium is an under-recognised condition which adversely affects deteriorating patients. Delirium can be an acute or long-term condition and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, and extended length of hospital stay. The management of delirium is often reactive rather than proactive, which can lead to the inappropriate use of chemical and physical restraint to control agitation secondary to hyperactive delirium. Caring for patients with delirium presents physical and emotional challenges for nurses, who are sometimes inclined to use restraint, which should be a last resort. This article describes the challenges of caring for patients with delirium, presents the risk factors for and assessment of delirium, and describes the management of agitation secondary to hyperactive delirium. Support and education for nurses caring for patients with delirium is essential to ensure optimal patient care and avoid staff burnout.
