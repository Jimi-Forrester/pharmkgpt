36363543|t|The Relationship between Neuropsychiatric Symptoms and Cognitive Performance in Older Adults with Normal Cognition.
36363543|a|Background and Objectives: To explore whether specific Neuropsychiatric Symptoms (NPS) are related to worse performance in particular cognitive domains. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional analysis of the baseline evaluations of older (>=60 years), cognitively unimpaired (CU) participants from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) Uniform Data Set was performed. Data were derived from 43 Alzheimer's Disease Research Centers. Cognitively impaired individuals, participants with psychiatric disorders and/or under treatment with antipsychotic, anxiolytic, sedative, or hypnotic agents were excluded. NPS were assessed using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire. The association of NPS with participants' performance on episodic memory, semantic memory, language, attention, processing speed and executive function was analysed using an adjusted (considering important demographic and medical factors) multivariate general linear model. Results: A total of 7179 CU, older, predominantly female, Caucasian, and well-educated participants were included in the present analysis. Among them, 1856 individuals had one or more NPS. Our analysis revealed that moderate/severe anxiety was related to worse performance on semantic memory, attention and executive function, the presence of hallucinations was linked to worse processing speed and executive function scores, while the presence of elation/euphoria and aberrant motor behaviour were associated with poorer attention and language performance, respectively. In the context of a secondary, exploratory analysis, the presence of moderate/severe delusions was related to worse processing speed and executive function performance. Conclusions: The relationship between specific NPS and worse performance in particular cognitive domains could inform the formulation of individualized preventive strategies directed to the ''fortification'' of specific cognitive functions in CU individuals with NPS.
