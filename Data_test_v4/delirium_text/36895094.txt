36895094|a|INTRODUCTION: We constructed a polygenic risk score (PRS) for beta-amyloid (PRSAbeta42) to proxy AD pathology and investigated its association with incident Alzheimer's disease (AD)/amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and the influence of cognitive reserve (CR), proxied by educational years, on the relationship between PRSAbeta42 and AD/aMCI risk. METHODS: A total of 618 cognitive-normal participants were followed-up for 2.92 years. The association of PRSAbeta42 and CR with AD/aMCI incidence was examined with COX models. Then we examined the additive interaction between PRSAbeta42 and CR and the CR effect across participants with different PRSAbeta42 levels. RESULTS: Higher PRSAbeta42 and CR were associated with a 33.9% higher risk and 8.3% less risk for AD/aMCI, respectively. An additive interaction between PRSAbeta42 and CR was observed. High CR was associated with 62.6% less risk of AD/aMCI incidence only in the high-PRSAbeta42 group. DISCUSSION: A super-additive effect of PRSAbeta42 and CR on AD/aMCI risk was observed. CR influence was evident in participants with high PRSAbeta42.
