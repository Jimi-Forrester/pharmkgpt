38700886|a|We aimed to investigate the role of Synbiotic preparations on the interaction of gut microbiota with AD development. APP/PS1 mice were randomized into APP/PS1 and Synbiotics groups, and C57BL/6J mice were used as wild type (WT) control group. The mice in the Synbiotics group and the APP/PS1 group were given Synbiotics and xylo-oligosaccharides for 3 months, respectively. The mice in the WT group were given the same amount of normal saline. Cognitive function was measured. Positron emission computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MRI) was used to detect fasting blood glucose level. Immunohistochemical assay, ELISA, western blot and qRT-PCR were carried out to detect inflammatory factors. DNA extraction of fecal sample was performed to carry out sequencing. Bioinformatics analysis, metabolites sample preparation and Liquid Chromatograph Mass Spectrometer (LC/MS) analysis were also performed. Synbiotics treatment can significantly ameliorate learning and memory competence by inhibiting Abeta protein deposition. Different bacteria in the intestine were significantly improved and changes in gut microbiota can affect the intestinal metabolism to affect multiple potential pathways after Synbiotics treatment. Synbiotics treatment can activate peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPARs) signaling pathway and significantly reduce neuroinflammation in APP/PS1 mice brains. Synbiotics treatment can effectively reduce neuro-inflammatory response through the regulation of intestinal microflora to delay AD development.
