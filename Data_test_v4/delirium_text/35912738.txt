35912738|t|Association of Cerebral Small Vessel Disease Burden with Neuropsychiatric Symptoms in Non-Demented Elderly: A Longitudinal Study.
35912738|a|BACKGROUND: The links between cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) burden and neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) have not been fully studied. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to explore the associations of the CSVD burden with Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) total scores and its subsyndromes in the elderly without dementia. METHODS: We investigated 630 non-demented participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. All of them had NPI assessments and 3 Tesla MRI scans at baseline and 616 had longitudinal NPI assessments during the follow-up. Linear mixed-effects models were used to investigate the cross-sectional and longitudinal associations of CSVD burden with NPI total scores and its subsyndromes. RESULTS: Higher CSVD burden longitudinally predicted more serious neuropsychiatric symptoms, including NPS (p &amp;lt; 0.0001), hyperactivity (p = 0.0006), affective symptoms (p = 0.0091), and apathy (p &amp;lt; 0.0001) in the total participants. Lacunar infarcts (LIs), white matter hyperactivities (WMHs), and cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) might play important roles in the occurrence of NPS, since they were longitudinally associated with specific neuropsychiatric subsyndromes. LIs contributed to hyperactivity (p = 0.0092), psychosis (p = 0.0402), affective symptoms (p = 0.0156), and apathy (p &amp;lt; 0.0001). WMHs were associated with hyperactivity (p = 0.0377) and apathy (p = 0.0343). However, CMBs were only related to apathy (p = 0.0141). CONCLUSION: CSVD burden was associated with multiple neuropsychiatric symptoms, suggesting the importance of monitoring and controlling vascular risk factors. Different markers of CSVD were associated with specific subsyndromes of NPS, suggesting that different markers tended to occur in different encephalic regions.
