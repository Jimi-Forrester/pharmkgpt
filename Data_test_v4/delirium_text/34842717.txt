34842717|t|A Quality Improvement Initiative to Reduce Postoperative Delirium among Cardiac Surgery Patients.
34842717|a|Patients following cardiac surgery commonly experience post-operative delirium (POD) during their postoperative hospital stay. A multifaceted, specialty wide, quality improvement (QI) project was undertaken for patients experiencing POD. The goal was to develop a reduction in POD care bundle (rPOD-a structured patient care program) that encompasses efficient preoperative risk factor identification and a postoperative patient-care process to ensure early POD identification and treatment. The following steps were taken to implement the rPOD care bundle including: (a) Developing a quality driven, evidence-based guideline for the perioperative cardiac surgery health care team, (b) identifying and addressing local barriers to implementation, (c) selecting performance measures to assess intervention adherence and patient outcomes, and (d) ensuring that all patients receive the interventions through staff engagement and education, and regular project evaluation. Trends of process measures and quality improvement measures were examined. An increasing trend in the rate of postoperative delirium screening during implementation of rPOD intervention was demonstrated. This quality improvement study provides a bases for future postoperative delirium reduction interventions.
