35893883|a|Neuropathologies, such as neuroinflammaging, have arisen as a serious concern for preserving the quality of life due to the global increase in neurodegenerative illnesses. Nowadays, neuronutraceuticals have gained remarkable attention. It is necessary to investigate the bioavailability, off-target effects, and mechanism of action of neuronutraceuticals. To comprehend the comprehensive impact on brain health, well-designed randomized controlled trials testing combinations of neuronutraceuticals are also necessary. Although there is a translational gap between basic and clinical research, the present knowledge of the molecular perspectives of neuroinflammaging and neuronutraceuticals may be able to slow down brain aging and to enhance cognitive performance. The present review also highlights the key emergent issues, such as regulatory and scientific concerns of neuronutraceuticals, including bioavailability, formulation, blood-brain permeability, safety, and efficacy.
