38287344|a|BACKGROUND: Mosaic loss of Y chromosome (LOY) is the most common chromosomal alteration in aging men. Here, we use single-cell RNA and ATAC sequencing to show that LOY is present in the kidney and increases with age and chronic kidney disease. RESULTS: The likelihood of a cell having LOY varies depending on its location in the nephron. Cortical epithelial cell types have a greater proportion of LOY than medullary or glomerular cell types, which may reflect their proliferative history. Proximal tubule cells are the most abundant cell type in the cortex and are susceptible to hypoxic injury. A subset of these cells acquires a pro-inflammatory transcription and chromatin accessibility profile associated with expression of HAVCR1, VCAM1, and PROM1. These injured epithelial cells have the greatest proportion of LOY and their presence predicts future kidney function decline. Moreover, proximal tubule cells with LOY are more likely to harbor additional large chromosomal gains and express pro-survival pathways. Spatial transcriptomics localizes injured proximal tubule cells to a pro-fibrotic microenvironment where they adopt a secretory phenotype and likely communicate with infiltrating immune cells. CONCLUSIONS: We hypothesize that LOY is an indicator of increased DNA damage and potential marker of cellular senescence that can be applied to single-cell datasets in other tissues.
