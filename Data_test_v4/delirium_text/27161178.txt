27161178|a|AIMS: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of dulaglutide 1.5 and 0.75 mg in elderly patients (aged >=65 years) with type 2 diabetes (T2D) in six phase III clinical trials. METHODS: Patients were grouped into two age groups: >=65 and <65 years. Pooled analysis for glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) change from baseline, percentage of patients achieving HbA1c targets, and gastrointestinal tolerability were evaluated at 26 weeks for each dulaglutide dose. Change in weight from baseline and rates of hypoglycaemia were evaluated for each individual study. RESULTS: A total of 958 of 5171 (18.5%) patients were aged >=65 years. The reductions in HbA1c were similar between age groups for dulaglutide 1.5 mg-treated patients {least squares [LS] mean for patients aged >=65 years: -1.24 [95% confidence interval (CI) -1.36, -1.12] and for patients aged <65 years: -1.29 [95% CI -1.38, -1.20]} and for dulaglutide 0.75 mg-treated patients [LS mean for patients aged >=65 years: -1.16 (95% CI -1.29, -1.03) and for patients aged <65 years: -1.10 (95% CI -1.19, -1.01)] at 26 weeks. The percentages of patients who achieved HbA1c targets of <7, <8 or <9% were also similar in the two groups with both dulaglutide doses. Patients aged >=65 years had similar weight change to patients aged <65 years. Severe hypoglycaemic events were infrequent. A similar incidence of gastrointestinal adverse events was observed in each age group with both dulaglutide doses. CONCLUSION: Both dulaglutide doses were well tolerated, with similar efficacy in patients with T2D aged >=65 years to those aged <65 years. Dulaglutide can be considered a safe and effective treatment option for use in older adults.
