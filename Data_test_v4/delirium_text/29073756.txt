29073756|a|Ofloxacin is a commonly used quinolone antibiotic both in adults as well as children. It is generally safe and well tolerated. Rarely, neurological and psychiatric adverse reactions are reported to occur with ofloxacin. We report a case of a child who developed delirium after ofloxacin treatment, that resolved after medication discontinuation and treatment with low dose olanzapine.
