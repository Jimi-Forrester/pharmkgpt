39603407|a|Dementia is an increasing disorder, and Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the cause of 60% of all dementia cases. Despite all efforts, there is no cure for stopping dementia progression. Recent studies reported potential effects of psychedelics on neuroinflammation during AD. Psychedelics by 5HT2AR activation can reduce proinflammatory cytokine levels (TNF-alpha, IL-6) and inhibit neuroinflammation. In addition to neuroinflammation suppression, psychedelics induce neuroplasticity by increasing Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels through Sigma-1R stimulation. This review discussed the effects of psychedelics on AD from both neuroinflammatory and neuroplasticity standpoints.
