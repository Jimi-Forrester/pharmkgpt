9172971|a|Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is relatively poorly documented in psychiatry. An observation will be presented concerning a 69 years old patient admitted for conduct disorder and prosecution delirium. In fact, the symptomatology associated dementia, transient confusion, parkinsonism, ataxia and abnormal movements. In the checkup the electroencephalogram gave us an important orientation for diagnosis. After a thoracic trauma the patient was admitted in an intensive care unit with a positive pressure ventilation. His general condition worsened until he died. Brain histic exploration and PRP gene analysis confirmed the diagnosis. Even if there is no efficient treatment, such a diagnosis has to be done in order to take prophylactic measures and conduct epidemiological surveys.
