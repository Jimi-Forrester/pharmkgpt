32781641|t|Gastric Microbiome Diversities in Gastric Cancer Patients from Europe and Asia Mimic the Human Population Structure and Are Partly Driven by Microbiome Quantitative Trait Loci.
32781641|a|The human gastrointestinal tract harbors approximately 100 trillion microorganisms with different microbial compositions across geographic locations. In this work, we used RNASeq data from stomach samples of non-disease (164 individuals from European ancestry) and gastric cancer patients (137 from Europe and Asia) from public databases. Although these data were intended to characterize the human expression profiles, they allowed for a reliable inference of the microbiome composition, as confirmed from measures such as the genus coverage, richness and evenness. The microbiome diversity (weighted UniFrac distances) in gastric cancer mimics host diversity across the world, with European gastric microbiome profiles clustering together, distinct from Asian ones. Despite the confirmed loss of microbiome diversity from a healthy status to a cancer status, the structured profile was still recognized in the disease condition. In concordance with the parallel host-bacteria population structure, we found 16 human loci (non-synonymous variants) in the European-descendent cohorts that were significantly associated with specific genera abundance. These microbiome quantitative trait loci display heterogeneity between population groups, being mainly linked to the immune system or cellular features that may play a role in enabling microbe colonization and inflammation.
