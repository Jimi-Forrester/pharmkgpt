34402661|a|Background: Alzheimer's disease is a chronic neurodegenerative chronic disease with a heavy social and economic impact in our developed societies, which still lacks an efficient therapy. Method: This paper describes the Hantzsch multicomponent synthesis of twelve alkyl hexahydro-quinoline-3-carboxylates, 4a-l, along with the evaluation of their Ca2+ channel blockade capacity, cholinesterase inhibition and antioxidant power. Results: Compound 4l showed submicromolar inhibition of butyrylcholinesterase, Ca2+ channel antagonism and an antioxidant effect. Conclusion: Compound 4l is an interesting compound that deserves further investigation for Alzheimer's disease therapy.
