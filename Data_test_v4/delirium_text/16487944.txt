16487944|t|Imaging and in vivo quantitation of beta-amyloid: an exemplary biomarker for Alzheimer's disease?
16487944|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized pathologically by the presence of beta-amyloid plaques in the brain. A substantial body of research indicates that the presence of increased beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) is neurotoxic and may initiate the further pathology observed in AD, including neurofibrillary tangles, synaptic loss and dysfunction, and neurodegeneration. The use of brain imaging in patients with or at risk for AD has increased our understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease and may potentially aid in diagnosis. The development of new therapeutics that reduce Abeta in the brain has also indicated a potential use for amyloid imaging in monitoring response to treatment. This review explores the utility of amyloid as a biomarker and the use of positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging in the diagnosis and treatment of AD.
