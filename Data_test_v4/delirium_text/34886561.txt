34886561|a|The intestinal mucosa provides a selective permeable barrier for nutrient absorption and protection from external factors. It consists of epithelial cells, immune cells and their secretions. The gut microbiota participates in regulating the integrity and function of the intestinal barrier in a homeostatic balance. Pathogens, xenobiotics and food can disrupt the intestinal barrier, promoting systemic inflammation and tissue damage. Genetic and immune factors predispose individuals to gut barrier dysfunction, and changes in the composition and function of the gut microbiota are central to this process. The progressive identification of these changes has led to the development of the concept of 'leaky gut syndrome' and 'gut dysbiosis', which underlie the relationship between intestinal barrier impairment, metabolic diseases and autoimmunity. Understanding the mechanisms underlying this process is an intriguing subject of research for the diagnosis and treatment of various intestinal and extraintestinal diseases.
