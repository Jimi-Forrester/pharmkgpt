37569863|t|Brain Mitochondrial Bioenergetics in Genetic Neurodevelopmental Disorders: Focus on Down, Rett and Fragile X Syndromes.
37569863|a|Mitochondria, far beyond their prominent role as cellular powerhouses, are complex cellular organelles active as central metabolic hubs that are capable of integrating and controlling several signaling pathways essential for neurological processes, including neurogenesis and neuroplasticity. On the other hand, mitochondria are themselves regulated from a series of signaling proteins to achieve the best efficiency in producing energy, in establishing a network and in performing their own de novo synthesis or clearance. Dysfunctions in signaling processes that control mitochondrial biogenesis, dynamics and bioenergetics are increasingly associated with impairment in brain development and involved in a wide variety of neurodevelopmental disorders. Here, we review recent evidence proving the emerging role of mitochondria as master regulators of brain bioenergetics, highlighting their control skills in brain neurodevelopment and cognition. We analyze, from a mechanistic point of view, mitochondrial bioenergetic dysfunction as causally interrelated to the origins of typical genetic intellectual disability-related neurodevelopmental disorders, such as Down, Rett and Fragile X syndromes. Finally, we discuss whether mitochondria can become therapeutic targets to improve brain development and function from a holistic perspective.
