37428734|t|The role of caregiving in cognitive function and change: The REGARDS study.
37428734|a|Chronic stress is associated with negative health outcomes, including poorer cognition. Some studies found stress from caregiving associated with worse cognitive functioning; however, findings are mixed. The present study examined the relationship between caregiving, caregiving strain, and cognitive functioning. We identified participants in the Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study who were family caregivers at baseline assessment and used propensity matching on 14 sociodemographic and health variables to identify matched noncaregivers for comparison. Data included up to 14 years of repeated assessments of global cognitive functioning, learning and memory, and executive functioning. Our results showed that when compared to noncaregivers, caregivers had better baseline scores on global cognitive functioning and word list learning (WLL). Among caregivers, a lot of strain was associated with better WLL and delayed word recall in the unadjusted model only. Caregivers with a lot of strain had higher depressive symptoms but not significantly higher high-sensitivity c-reactive protein (hsCRP) at baseline compared to caregivers with no or some strain after covariate adjustment. Although caregiving can be highly stressful, we found caregiving status and caregiving strain were not associated with cognitive decline. More methodologically rigorous studies are needed, and conclusions that caregiving has negative effects on cognition should be viewed with caution.
