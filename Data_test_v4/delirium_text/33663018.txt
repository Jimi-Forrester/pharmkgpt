33663018|a|INTRODUCTION: We examined the long-term risk of dementia after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in relation to age and sex. METHODS: All CABG patients in Sweden 1992-2015 (n = 111,335), and matched controls (n = 222,396) were included in a population-based study. Adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) for all-cause dementia, vascular dementia, and Alzheimer's disease were calculated. RESULTS: There was no difference in the risk for all-cause dementia between CABG patients and control subjects (aHR 0.98 [95% confidence interval 0.95 to 1.02]). CABG patients <65 years and 65 to 74 years had higher risk (aHR 1.29 [1.17-1.42] and 1.08 [1.02-1.13], respectively), and patients >=75 years had lower risk (aHR 0.76 [0.71-0.81]). The highest risk was observed in women <65 years (aHR 1.64 [1.31-2.05]). DISCUSSION: Overall, the long-term risk for all-cause dementia does not differ between CABG patients and the general population. Younger patients have a higher risk, while older patients have a lower risk, compared to controls.
