This case-control observational study aims to investigate the possible relationship of these elements to the diagnosis and pathophysiology of the disease. METHODS: This case-control observational study was performed using 40 AD patients in different clinical stages and 40 healthy control subjects, living in a similar environment with low As exposure. The levels of As and Se in nail and hair were measured with Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry. The results were analysed with regards to clinical condition, age, disease duration, sex, education, living environment, and the relationship of the two elements using Mann Whitney U test and Spearman Rho or Pearson correlation tests as appropriate. RESULTS: The levels of As and Se were not related to age, disease duration, sex, education, or living environment in the study groups (p > 0.05). The levels of As and Se in hair and nail samples of all patients and patient subgroups were higher than those in the healthy subjects (p < 0.001). A positive correlation was found between the levels of As and Se in both hair and nail samples only in the patient group (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: According to the results, As and Se levels probably increase due to some metabolic or genetic factors affecting both of them together. There may be an increase in the unregulated pool (selenomethionine) and a decrease in the regulated pool of Se (selenosycteine) in AD. Our findings need verification and the subject seems to deserve more elaborate evaluations including genetic analyses and analysis of different chemical forms of these elements.
