31277476|a|Advanced glycation end products (AGE), the most known aging biomarker, may cause "inflamm-aging" (i.e., chronic low-grade inflammation that develops with aging) in both aged and diabetes groups. However, the molecular bases of inflamm-aging remain obscure. We prepared AGE by incubating BSA (0.0746 mmol/L) + glucose (0.5 mol/L) at 37  C in 5% CO2-95% air for 1-180 days. The lysine glycation in BSA-AGE reached 77% on day 30 and 100% after day 130, whereas the glycation of arginine and cysteine was minimal. The Nepsilon-(carboxymethyl)-lysine content in BSA-AGE was also increased with increasing number of incubation days. The lectin-binding assay revealed that the glycation of BSA not only altered the conformational structure, but lost binding capacity with various lectins. An immunological functional assay showed that BSA-AGE > 8 mug/mL significantly suppressed normal human Th1 (IL-2 and IFN-gamma) and Th2 (IL-10) mRNA expression, whereas AGE > 0.5 mug/mL enhanced monocyte IL-6 production irrelevant to cell apoptosis. The AGE-enhanced monocyte IL-6 production was via MAPK-ERK and MyD88-transduced NF-kappaBp50 signaling pathways. To elucidate the structure-function relationship of BSA-AGE-enhanced IL-6 production, we pre-preincubated BSA-AGE with different carbohydrate-degrading, protein-degrading, and glycoprotein-degrading enzymes. We found that trypsin and carboxypeptidase Y suppressed whereas beta-galactosidase enhanced monocyte IL-6 production. In conclusion, BSA-AGE exerted both immunosuppressive and pro-inflammatory effects that are the molecular basis of inflamm-aging in aged and diabetes groups.
