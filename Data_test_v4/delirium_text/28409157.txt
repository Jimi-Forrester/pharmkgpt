28409157|a|It is well known that oxidative stresses induce the production of amyloid beta (Abeta) in the brain, lens, and retina, leading to age-related diseases. In the present study, we investigated the effects of ferulic acid on the Abeta levels in H2O2-stimulated human lens epithelial (HLE) SRA 01/04 cells. Three types of Abeta peptides (Abeta1-40, Abeta1-42, and Abeta1-43) were measured by ELISA, and the levels of mRNA for the expressed proteins related to Abeta production (APP, BACE1, and PS proteins) and degradation (ADAM10, NEP, and ECE1 proteins) were determined by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. H2O2 stimulation augmented gene expression of the proteins related to Abeta production, resulting in the production of three types of Abeta peptides. Treatment with 0.1 muM ferulic acid attenuated the augmentations of gene expression and production of the proteins related to the secretion of three types of Abeta peptides in the H2O2-stimulated HLE cells. These results provided evidence of antioxidative functions of ferulic acid for lens epithelial cells.
