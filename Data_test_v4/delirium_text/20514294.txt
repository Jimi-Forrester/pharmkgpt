20514294|a|Recent studies have suggested implications for alpha-synuclein cytotoxicity in the pathomechanism of multiple system atrophy (MSA). Given in vitro evidence that alpha-synuclein generates oxidative stress, it is proposed that lipid peroxidation may be accelerated in MSA. To address this issue, we performed an immunohistochemical analysis of protein-bound 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (P-HNE) in sections of archival, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded pontine materials of eight sporadic MSA patients and eight age-matched control subjects. In the MSA cases, P-HNE immunoreactivity was localized in all of the neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions and glial cytoplasmic inclusions, both of them identified with alpha-synuclein and ubiquitin. It was also detectable in reactive astrocytes and phagocytic microglia but undetectable in activated microglia. By contrast, P-HNE immunoreactivity in the control cases was only very weak or not at all in the parenchyma including neurons and glia. The present results provide in vivo evidence that HNE participates in alpha-synuclein-induced cytotoxicity and neuroinflammation in MSA.
