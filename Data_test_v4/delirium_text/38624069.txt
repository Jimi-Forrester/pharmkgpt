The present study aims to understand the influence of multiple variables on anxiety-like behavior in TgF344-AD rats and determine whether anxiety impacts memory performance. METHODS: An elevated plus maze was used to assess anxiety-like behavior in the established colony (n = 107). Influences of age, sex, genotype, and exercise on anxiety were evaluated via multiple linear regression. Correlation analysis evaluated the relationship between anxiety and memory performance. RESULTS: Age (P < 0.05) and AD genotype (P < 0.001) were associated with increasing anxiety, while exercise (P < 0.05) was associated with decreasing anxiety. Female AD animals displayed more anxiety-like behavior versus wild-type female (P < 0.001) and AD male (P < 0.05) littermates. DISCUSSION: Concluding that while factors such as age, sex, AD genotype, and training status can impact anxiety levels in the TgF344-AD model, anxiety level did not impact memory performance. HIGHLIGHTS: Increased anxiety-like behavior in TgF344-AD rats does not correlate with declines in memory performance. Predictors of higher anxiety-like behaviors in the TgF344-AD rat include age, Alzheimer's disease (AD) genotype, and sex with female AD animals experiencing greater anxiety compared to female wild-type or male AD. Exercise training leads to decreased anxiety-like behaviors in the TgF344-AD rat.
