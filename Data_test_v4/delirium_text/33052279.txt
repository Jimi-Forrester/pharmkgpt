33052279|a|We report a case of acute severe hyponatremia within 24 hours after a duloxetine overdose. An 82-year-old woman presented to the ED after ingesting duloxetine and diltiazem. She became hemodynamically unstable due to the diltiazem overdose and was appropriately resuscitated. During hospitalization she experienced hyponatremia consistent with syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH). Based on the observations we concluded there was a probable relationship between the hyponatremia and the duloxetine overdose. Clinicians should monitor patients' electrolytes for acute disturbances after an overdose of duloxetine.
