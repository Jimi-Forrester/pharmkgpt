28879292|a|BACKGROUND: The most important reason for pre-operative administration of medication is to reduce anxiety. Alleviation of fear and anxiety about surgery enables patients to remain comfortable during treatment. Dexmedetomidine (DEX) is a fast-acting drug that is used as a premedication in different circumstances because it has sedative and anti-anxiolytic effects, and stable hemodynamics. It also has the advantage of intranasal administration. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects and hemodynamic stability of DEX by retrospectively analyzing cases in which DEX was administered nasally as a premedication. METHODS: Ten patients treated at Dankook University Dental Hospital, recruited between February and April 2015, received intranasal delivery of 2 microg/kg DEX, 30 minutes prior to general anesthesia. Anesthesia records of anxiety, blood pressure, respiration, pulse, estimated arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2), and partial pressure, or maximum concentration, of carbon dioxide (ETCO2) were analyzed. RESULTS: Administration of DEX prior to a general anesthetic effectively relieved anxiety. Respiratory depression, the most severe adverse effect of other sedatives, was not observed. Hemodynamic stability under general anesthesia was maintained during treatment and a reduction in emergence delirium was observed upon completion of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Premedication administration of DEX is safe for pediatric patients undergoing dental treatment under general anesthesia.
