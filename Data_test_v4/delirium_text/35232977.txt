35232977|a|Schizophrenia is a complex polygenic disease that is affected by genetic, developmental, and environmental factors. Accumulating evidence indicates that environmental factors such as maternal infection and excessive prenatal neuroinflammation may contribute to the onset of schizophrenia by affecting epigenetic modification. We recently identified a schizophrenia-associated upregulated long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) RP5-998N21.4 by transcriptomic analysis of monozygotic twins discordant for schizophrenia. Importantly, we found that genes coexpressed with RP5-998N21.4 were enriched in immune defense-related biological processes in twin subjects and in RP5-998N21.4-overexpressing (OE) SK-N-SH cell lines. We then identified two genes encoding an interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeat (IFIT) 2 and 3, which play an important role in immune defense, as potential targets of RP5-998N21.4 by integrative analysis of RP5-998N21.4OE-induced differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in SK-N-SH cells and RP5-998N21.4-coexpressed schizophrenia-associated DEGs from twin subjects. We further demonstrated that RP5-998N21.4 positively regulates the transcription of IFIT2 and IFIT3 by binding to their promoter regions and affecting their histone modifications. In addition, as a general nuclear coactivator, RMB14 (encoding RNA binding motif protein 14) was identified to facilitate the regulatory role of RP5-998N21.4 in IFIT2 and IFIT3 transcription. Finally, we observed that RP5-998N21.4OE can enhance IFIT2- and IFIT3-mediated immune defense responses through activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) signaling pathway in U251 astrocytoma cells under treatment with the viral mimetic polyinosinic: polycytidylic acid (poly I:C). Taken together, our findings suggest that lncRNA RP5-998N21.4 is a critical regulator of immune defense, providing etiological and therapeutic implications for schizophrenia.
