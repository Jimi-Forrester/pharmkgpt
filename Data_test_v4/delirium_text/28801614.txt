28801614|a|Traced dopamine (DA) detection is critical for the early diagnosis and prevention of some diseases such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer and schizophrenia. In this research, a novel self-supporting three dimensional (3D) bicontinuous nanoporous electrochemical biosensor was developed for the detection of dopamine by Differential Pulse Voltammetry (DPV). This biosensor was fabricated by electrodepositing palladium nanoparticles (Pd) onto self-supporting nanoporous gold (NPG) wire. Because of the synergistic effects of the excellent catalytic activity of Pd and novel structure of NPG wire, the palladium nanoparticles decorated NPG (Pd/NPG) biosensor possess tremendous superiority in the detection of DA. The Pd/NPG wire biosensor exhibited high sensitivity of 1.19 muA muMu-1, broad detection range of 1-220 muM and low detection limit up to 1 muM. Besides, the proposed dopamine biosensor possessed good stability, reproducibility, reusability and selectivity. The response currents of detection in the fetal bovine serum were also close to the standard solutions. Therefore the Pd/NPG wire biosensor is promising to been used in clinic.
