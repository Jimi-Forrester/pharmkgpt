35011800|t|Surgery after Failed Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation: Indications and Outcomes of a Concerning Condition.
35011800|a|OBJECTIVES: The number of transcatheter aortic valve implantations (TAVI) has increased enormously in recent decades. Transcatheter valve prosthesis failure and the requirement of conventional surgical replacement are expected to attract more focus in the near future. Indeed, given the scarcity of research in this field, the next decade will likely represent the beginning of a period of meaningful exploration of the degenerative changes that occur with transcatheter valves. The current study represents-through a series of consecutive cases-one of the first analyses of the underlying causes of TAVI failure, i.e., degenerative, functional and infective, followed by surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) and postoperative outcome. METHODS: Between October 2008 and March 2021, 2098 TAVI procedures, including 1423 with transfemoral, 309 with transapical, and 366 with transaortic access, were performed in our institution. Among these, 0.5% (number(n) = 11) required acute SAVR (n = 6) within 7 days (n = 3) or later (n = 2), and were included in the study. RESULTS: Valve stent dislocation was the most common cause of replacement (83%). Causes of replacement within 7 days after TAVI were multifactorial. In the later course, endocarditis was the sole indication for SAVR after TAVI. TAVI with transapical or transaortal approach had a higher EuroSCORE II (10.9 (7.2-35.3) vs. 3.5 (1.8-7.8)). Their 30-day mortality after surgical conversion was higher (67% vs. 20%), when compared to those who underwent a transfemoral procedure. The longest documented survival beyond 30 days was 58 months. CONCLUSIONS: The causes of SAVR after TAVI failure are multifactorial, and include biological, physical and infectious factors. An acceptable midterm prognosis may be expected in patients with physical causes when dislocation of the catheter prosthesis is observed; in such cases, emergency conversion is required. Conversion due to infection, as in cases of endocarditis, had the worst outcome. Prognosis after conversion due to degeneration is still problematic, due to a lack of autopsies and the recent history of prosthetic implantations.
