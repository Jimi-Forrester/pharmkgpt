33000175|t|CAPN6 in disease: An emerging therapeutic target (Review).
33000175|a|As a member of the calpain protein family, calpain6 (CAPN6) is highly expressed mainly in the placenta and embryos. It plays a number of important roles in cellular processes, such as the stabilization of microtubules, the maintenance of cell stability, the control of cell movement and the inhibition of apoptosis. In recent years, various studies have found that CAPN6 is one of the contributing factors associated with the tumorigenesis of uterine tumors and osteosarcoma, and that CAPN6 participates in the development of tumors by promoting cell proliferation and angiogenesis, and by inhibiting apoptosis, which is mainly regulated by the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) pathway. Due to its abnormal cellular expression, CAPN6 has also been found to be associated with a number of diseases, such as white matter damage and muscular dystrophy. Therefore, CAPN6 may be a novel therapeutic target for these diseases. In the present review, the role of CAPN6 in disease and its possible use as a target in various therapies are discussed.
