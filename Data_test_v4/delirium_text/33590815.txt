33590815|a|Amyloids are the fibrillar protein aggregates with cross-beta structure. Traditionally amyloids were associated with pathology, however, nowadays more data is emerging about functional amyloids playing essential roles in cellular processes. We conducted screening for functional amyloids in rat brain. One of the identified proteins was STXBP1 taking part in vesicular transport and neurotransmitter secretion. Using SDD-AGE and protein fractionation we found out that STXBP1 forms small detergent-insoluble aggregates in rat brain. With immunoprecipitation analysis and C-DAG system, we showed that STXBP1 forms amyloid-like fibrils. Thus, STXBP1 demonstrates amyloid properties in rat brain and in bacterial expression system.
