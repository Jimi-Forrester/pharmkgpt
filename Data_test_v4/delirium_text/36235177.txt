36235177|t|Antioxidant, Antimicrobial and In Silico NADPH Oxidase Inhibition of Chemically-Analyzed Essential Oils Derived from Ballota deserti (Noe) Jury.
36235177|a|Ballota deserti (Noe) Jury (B. deserti) is a medicinal plant used in Ayurvedic medicine. The chemical composition, antioxidant, antibacterial, and antifungal properties of essential oils from B. deserti (EOBD) against drug-resistant microorganisms were examined in this work. Hydrodistillation was used to extract EOBD, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to identify its constituents. Ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) were used to assess the antioxidant effect of EOBD. The disc diffusion agar and the microdilution tests were used in the assessment of the antibacterial properties of EOBD against clinically resistant pathogenic microorganisms. An in silico approach was used to evaluate the inhibitory potential of EOBD against NADPH oxidase. The yield of EOBD was 0.41%, and was primarily composed of linalool (37.82%), cineole (12.04%), and borneol (11.07%). EOBD had good antioxidant potency, with calculated values of 19.82 +- 1.14 microg/mL (DPPH), 64.78 +- 5.21 microg/mL (FRAP), 996.84 +- 20.18 microg EAA/ mg (TAC). Both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria were inhibited by EOBD with inhibition zones ranging from 17.481.75 mm to 28.471.44 mm. EOBD exhibited MICs ranging from 10.78 g/mL to 22.48 g/mL when tested against bacteria using the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) assay. Similarly, impressive antifungal activity was observed against fungal strains with inhibition zone widths ranging from 16.761.83 to 36.791.35 mm. Results of MICs assay against fungi showed that EOBD had MICs values ranging from 15.32 +- 1.47 to 23.74 +- 1.54 microg/mL. Docking results showed that thujone, o-cymene, and butanoic acid contained in EOBD possessed strong activity against NADPH oxidase, with glide scores of -5.403, -5.344, and -4.973 Kcal/mol, respectively. In light of these findings, the EOBD may be seen as a potential source of chemical compounds with significant biological capabilities that can be advantageous as natural antioxidants and develop an effective weapon against a wide range of pathogenic bacteria.
