36143216|t|A Scoping Review on Body Fluid Biomarkers for Prognosis and Disease Activity in Patients with Multiple Sclerosis.
36143216|a|Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a complex demyelinating disease of the central nervous system, presenting with different clinical forms, including clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), which is a first clinical episode suggestive of demyelination. Several molecules have been proposed as prognostic biomarkers in MS. We aimed to perform a scoping review of the potential use of prognostic biomarkers in MS clinical practice. We searched MEDLINE up to 25 November 2021 for review articles assessing body fluid biomarkers for prognostic purposes, including any type of biomarkers, cell types and tissues. Original articles were obtained to confirm and detail the data reported by the review authors. We evaluated the reliability of the biomarkers based on the sample size used by various studies. Fifty-two review articles were included. We identified 110 molecules proposed as prognostic biomarkers. Only six studies had an adequate sample size to explore the risk of conversion from CIS to MS. These confirm the role of oligoclonal bands, immunoglobulin free light chain and chitinase CHI3L1 in CSF and of serum vitamin D in the prediction of conversion from CIS to clinically definite MS. Other prognostic markers are not yet explored in adequately powered samples. Serum and CSF levels of neurofilaments represent a promising biomarker.
