37591521|a|Adoptive immunotherapy using chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-engineered T cells can induce robust antitumor responses against hematologic malignancies. However, its efficacy is not durable in the majority of the patients, warranting further improvement of T cell functions. Cytokine signaling is one of the key cascades regulating T cell survival and effector functions. In addition to cytokines that use the common gamma chain as a receptor subunit, multiple cytokines regulate T cell functions directly or indirectly. Modulating cytokine signaling in CAR-T cells by genetic engineering is one promising strategy to augment their therapeutic efficacy. These strategies include ectopic expression of cytokines, cytokine receptors and synthetic molecules that mimic endogenous cytokine signaling. Alternatively, autocrine IL-2 signaling can be augmented through reprogramming of CAR-T cell properties through transcriptional and epigenetic modification. On the other hand, cytokine production by CAR-T cells triggers systemic inflammatory responses, which mainly manifest as adverse events such as cytokine-release syndrome and neurotoxicity. In addition to inhibiting direct inflammatory mediators such as IL-6 and IL-1 released from activated macrophages, suppression of T cell-derived cytokines associated with the priming of macrophages can be accomplished through genetic modification of CAR-T cells. In this review, I will outline recently developed synthetic biology approaches to exploit cytokine signaling to enhance CAR-T cell functions. I will also discuss therapeutic target molecules to prevent or alleviate CAR-T cell-related toxicities.
