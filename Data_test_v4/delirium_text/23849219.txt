23849219|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disease characterized by the accumulation of extracellular plaques and intracellular tangles. Recent studies support the hypothesis that the accumulation of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide within the brain arises from an imbalance of the production and clearance of Abeta. In rare genetic forms of AD, this imbalance is often caused by increased production of Abeta. However, recent evidence indicates that, in the majority of cases of AD, Abeta clearance is impaired. Apolipoprotein E (ApoE), the dominant cholesterol and lipid carrier in the brain, is critical for Abeta catabolism. The isoform of ApoE and its degree of lipidation critically regulate the efficiency of Abeta clearance. Studies in preclinical models of AD have demonstrated that coordinately increasing levels of ApoE and its lipid transporter, ABCA1, increases the clearance of Abeta, suggesting that this pathway may be a potential therapeutic target for AD.
