37445455|t|Prevalence and Factors Affecting Appropriate Inhaler Use in Elderly Patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease: A Prospective Study.
37445455|a|BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) mainly affects individuals aged 60 and older. The proper use of inhalers is crucial for managing COPD. This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence and factors affecting the appropriate use of inhalers among elderly patients with COPD. METHODS: We enrolled 91 elderly patients with COPD admitted to the Department of Respiratory, University Medical Center HCMC between October 2020 and May 2021. Patients who were capable of using the inhaler would have their inhaler usage recorded through video footage. Two respiratory experts carefully analyzed 133 video-recorded demonstrations for evaluation purposes. RESULTS: 18.7% of the patients demonstrated the correct inhaler technique. Pressurized metered dose inhaler (pMDI) and Turbuhaler had the lowest documented correct usage rates (11.9% and 10.0%, respectively). Two critical steps, namely "holding breath for about five seconds or as long as comfortable" and "breathing out gently," were commonly performed incorrectly when using pMDI, Respimat, Breezhaler, or Turbuhaler. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that lower mMRC scores (AOR = 5.3, CI 1.1-25.5, p = 0.037) and receiving inhaler instruction within the past three months (AOR = 5.2, CI 1.3-20.1, p = 0.017) were associated with increased odds of using the inhaler correctly. CONCLUSIONS: Our study found that less than 20% of elderly patients with COPD use inhalers correctly. Common errors include inadequate breath-holding and gentle exhalation. mMRC scores and recent inhaler instruction were predictors of proper use. These findings can aid clinicians in improving inhaler management for elderly patients with COPD.
