36142849|t|Ellagic Acid and Its Anti-Aging Effects on Central Nervous System.
36142849|a|Aging is an unavoidable biological process that leads to the decline of human function and the reduction in people's quality of life. Demand for anti-aging medicines has become very urgent. Many studies have shown that ellagic acid (EA), a phenolic compound widely distributed in dicotyledonous plants, has powerful anti-inflammation and antioxidant properties. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that EA can enhance neuronal viability, reduce neuronal defects, and alleviate damage in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and cerebral ischemia. This paper reviews the biochemical functions and neuroprotective effects of EA, showing the clinical value of its application.
