20370959|a|BACKGROUND: There is uncertainty regarding the optimal use of pharmacological strategies in delirium particularly regarding preferred agents, duration of treatment and effectiveness in different populations. METHODS: Attitudes towards delirium pharmacotherapy were investigated before and after an educational workshop using the format of a television game show. RESULTS: Most respondents (65/66) reported psychotropic use with variable frequency (median 60%). Antipsychotic use was inversely related to perception of supporting evidence (p = 0.02). Respondents rated sedative (38%) and antipsychotic (33%) effects as the principal mechanism of action rather than a specific neurochemical anti-delirium effect (21%). Haloperidol was the preferred first-line agent (65%). Suggested continuation treatment after symptom resolution was three days. Eleven respondents had used psychotropics prophylactically. Antipsychotic use was influenced by concerns regarding potential for extrapyramidal (52%), sedative (32%), cerebrovascular (30%) and metabolic (8%) effects. Post-workshop concerns regarding extrapyramidal effects were reduced with a more positive general attitude towards pharmacological interventions, especially in hypoactive presentations (61%) and prophylactically in high-risk patients (56%). CONCLUSIONS: Attitudes towards key aspects of delirium pharmacotherapy vary considerably and relate to concerns regarding side effect potential more than perceived mechanism of action. Educational interventions can impact positively upon attitudes.
