18409541|t|[Case of non-alcoholic pellagra following gastrectomy].
18409541|a|A 67-year-old man was admitted to our hospital in May 2006 because of gait disturbance, delirium and myoclonus along with dermatitis and diarrhea. Those symptoms became worse in 3 months. He had undergone a gastrectomy, including a fundectomy and jejunal pouch interposition, for early gastric cancer at the age of 65 years. He had no habit of drinking alcohol or unbalanced diet. The triad of typical dermatitis, delirium, and diarrhea led to a diagnosis of pellagra, and all the symptoms disappeared after intravenous administration of nicotinate and vitamins. With a gastrectomy, fundectomy performed with jejunal pouch interposition has been regarded as a superior method for postoperative nutrition, but may cause vitamin deficiency. Thus, vitamin deficiency must be considered as a potential cause in neurologic patients who underwent surgical treatment for disorders of digestive tract, regardless of the procedure utilized.
