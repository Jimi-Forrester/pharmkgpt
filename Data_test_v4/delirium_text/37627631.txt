37627631|a|We investigated the potential of Inula britannica extract encapsulated in liposomes as a functional food ingredient with enhanced bioavailability and stability. Inula britannica, known for its anti-inflammatory properties and various health benefits, was encapsulated using a liposome mass production manufacturing method, and the physical properties of liposomes were evaluated. The liposomes exhibited improved anti-inflammatory effects in lipopolysaccharide-activated RAW 264.7 macrophages, suppressing the production of pro-inflammatory mediators such as nitric oxide and prostaglandin E2 and downregulating the expression of iNOS and COX-2 transcription factors. Additionally, we observed reduced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-1beta, and modulation of the NF-kappaB and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways. These findings suggest that Inula britannica extract encapsulated in liposomes could serve as a valuable functional food ingredient for managing and preventing inflammation-related disorders, making it a promising candidate for incorporation into various functional food products. The enhanced absorption and stability provided by liposomal encapsulation can enable better utilization of the extract's beneficial properties, promoting overall health and well-being.
