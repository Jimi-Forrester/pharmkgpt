3363018|t|A symptom rating scale for delirium.
3363018|a|The authors present a 10-item clinician-rated symptom rating scale for delirium. Compared to demented, schizophrenic, and normal control groups, 20 delirious subjects scored significantly higher on the scale, which quantitates multiple parameters affected by delirium. The scale can be used alone or in conjunction with an electroencephalogram and bedside cognitive tests to assess the delirious subject.
