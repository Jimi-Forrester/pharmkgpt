10230715|a|Major advances in understanding cholesterol dynamics and the role that cholesterol plays in vascular disease have recently been made. The brain is an organ that is highly enriched in cholesterol, but progress toward understanding brain cholesterol dynamics has been relatively limited. This review examines recent contributions to the understanding of brain cholesterol dynamics, focusing on extracellular and intracellular lipid carrier proteins, membrane cholesterol domains, and emerging evidence linking an association between cholesterol dynamics and Alzheimer's disease.
