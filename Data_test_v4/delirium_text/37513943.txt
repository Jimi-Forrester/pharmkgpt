37513943|t|Isolated Fraction of Gastric-Digested Camel Milk Yogurt with Carao (Cassia grandis) Pulp Fortification Enhances the Anti-Inflammatory Properties of HT-29 Human Intestinal Epithelial Cells.
37513943|a|Functional foods have recently generated a lot of attention among consumers looking for healthy options. Studies have examined yogurt with carao to increase health benefits and probiotic characteristics. It has been determined that carao fruit and camel milk have high phenolic compound and antioxidant activity concentrations. The objective of this study was to examine if carao (0, 1.3, 2.65, and 5.3 g/L) incorporated into yogurt enhances anti-inflammatory stimulus and antioxidant activity and impacts the physio-chemical and sensory properties of camel milk yogurt. HT-29 cells were used as a model of anti-inflammatory response, including cytokine responses of IL-8 and mRNA production of IL-1beta and TNF-alpha in gastric digested isolated fraction. In addition, pH, titratable acidity, Streptococcus thermophilus counts and Lactobacillus bulgaricus counts of camel yogurts were examined during the fermentation process in 0, 2.5, 5, and 7 h whereas viscosity, syneresis, and radical scavenging assay evaluations were determined at hour 7. Furthermore, a consumer study was performed. Compared to control samples, the incorporation of carao into yogurts did not lead to a significant (rho > 0.05) difference in the pH. In contrast, titratable acidity (TA), viscosity, syneresis, and antioxidant capacity significantly increased with the inclusion of 2.65 and 5.3 g/L carao, while 5.3 g/L carao significantly (rho < 0.05) increased the counts of both bacteria. The inflammatory response of IL-8 and the level of mRNA production of IL-1beta and TNF-alpha was significantly (rho < 0.05) lower with 2.65 and 5.3 g/L carao yogurt compared to control camel yogurt. Sensory attributes were not impacted by the addition of 1.3 and 2.65 g/L carao. Carao could be a possible ingredient to consider when improving the nutrition value of yogurt.
