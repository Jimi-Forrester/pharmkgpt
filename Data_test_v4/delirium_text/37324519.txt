37324519|a|Behavioral pattern separation and cognitive flexibility are essential cognitive abilities that are disrupted in many brain disorders. A better understanding of the neural circuitry involved in these abilities will open paths to treatment. In humans and mice, discrimination and adaptation rely on the integrity of the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) which receives glutamatergic input from the entorhinal cortex (EC), including the lateral EC (LEC). An inducible increase of EC-DG circuit activity improves simple hippocampal-dependent associative learning and increases DG neurogenesis. Here, we asked if the activity of LEC fan cells that directly project to the DG (LEC   DG neurons) regulates the relatively more complex hippocampal-dependent abilities of behavioral pattern separation or cognitive flexibility. C57BL/6J male mice received bilateral LEC infusions of a virus expressing shRNA TRIP8b, an auxiliary protein of an HCN channel or a control virus (SCR shRNA). Prior work shows that 4 weeks post-surgery, TRIP8b mice have more DG neurogenesis and greater activity of LEC   DG neurons compared to SCR shRNA mice. Here, 4 weeks post-surgery, the mice underwent testing for behavioral pattern separation and reversal learning (touchscreen-based location discrimination reversal [LDR]) and innate fear of open spaces (elevated plus maze [EPM]) followed by quantification of new DG neurons (doublecortin-immunoreactive cells [DCX+] cells). There was no effect of treatment (SCR shRNA vs. TRIP8b) on performance during general touchscreen training, LDR training, or the 1st days of LDR testing. However, in the last days of LDR testing, the TRIP8b shRNA mice had improved pattern separation (reached the first reversal more quickly and had more accurate discrimination) compared to the SCR shRNA mice, specifically when the load on pattern separation was high (lit squares close together or "small separation"). The TRIP8b shRNA mice were also more cognitively flexible (achieved more reversals) compared to the SCR shRNA mice in the last days of LDR testing. Supporting a specific influence on cognitive behavior, the SCR shRNA and TRIP8b shRNA mice did not differ in total distance traveled or in time spent in the closed arms of the EPM. Supporting an inducible increase in LEC-DG activity, DG neurogenesis was increased. These data indicate that the TRIP8b shRNA mice had better pattern separation and reversal learning and more neurogenesis compared to the SCR shRNA mice. This study advances fundamental and translational neuroscience knowledge relevant to two cognitive functions critical for adaptation and survival-behavioral pattern separation and cognitive flexibility-and suggests that the activity of LEC   DG neurons merits exploration as a therapeutic target to normalize dysfunctional DG behavioral output.
