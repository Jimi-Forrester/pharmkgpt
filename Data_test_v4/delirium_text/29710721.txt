29710721|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology in idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) contributes to poor shunt responses. Amyloid-beta 1- 42 (Abeta42) toxic conformer was recently identified with features of rapid oligomerization, strong neurotoxicity and synaptotoxicity. OBJECTIVE: This observational study points to Abeta42 toxic conformer as a biomarker for AD pathology and for poor postoperative prognosis in patients with iNPH. METHODS: The first cohort consisted of patients with AD (n = 17) and iNPH (n = 17), and cognitively normal individuals (CN, n = 12). The second cohort, consisted of 51 patients with iNPH, was divided into two groups according to phosphorylated Tau (pTau) level (low- and high-pTau groups); the low-pTau group was further subdivided according to one-year postoperative change in Abeta42 toxic conformer ratio (%) [Abeta42 toxic conformer/Abeta42x100] (decreased- and increased-conformer subgroups). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to measure pTau, Abeta42, and Abeta42 toxic conformer in cerebrospinal fluid. Outcomes were evaluated using neuropsychological tests one- and two-years postoperatively. RESULTS: In the first cohort, Abeta42 toxic conformer ratio in the iNPH group (10.8%) was significantly higher than that in the CN group (6.3%) and significantly lower than that in the AD group (17.2%). In the second cohort, the high-pTau group showed cognitive decline two-years postoperatively compared to baseline. However, the low-pTau group showed favorable outcomes one-year postoperatively; furthermore, the increased-conformer subgroup showed cognitive decline two-years postoperatively while the decreased-conformer subgroup maintained the improvement. CONCLUSIONS: Change in Abeta42 toxic conformer ratio predicts long-term cognitive outcome in iNPH, even in the low-pTau group.
