36381193|a|Background: The key role of apolipoprotein C-1 (ApoC-1) is reported in breast, pancreas and lung cancer. However, no information is available on potential difference of ApoC-1 between OSCC patients and healthy individuals. This work aimed to examine the serum ApoC-1 level as well as lipid profile values between OSCC patients and healthy control groups. Material and methods: In this study, 44 blood samples from 22 OSCC patients and 22 healthy individuals were collected to determine the values of lipid profile and ApoC-1 concentration using colorimetric method and Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA), respectively. Results: A significant decrease in serum lipid profile and ApoC-1 concentration was observed between OSCC and healthy control groups (P = 0.001). Conclusion: Our results confirm the previous findings on the significant differences of lipid profile between OSCC and controls, also show the lower serum level of ApoC-1 in OSCC as compared to the controls. Future studies would further elaborate the association of ApoC-1 with OSCC.
