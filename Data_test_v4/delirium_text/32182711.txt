32182711|t|Role of p53 in the Regulation of Cellular Senescence.
32182711|a|The p53 transcription factor plays a critical role in cellular responses to stress. Its activation in response to DNA damage leads to cell growth arrest, allowing for DNA repair, or directs cellular senescence or apoptosis, thereby maintaining genome integrity. Senescence is a permanent cell-cycle arrest that has a crucial role in aging, and it also represents a robust physiological antitumor response, which counteracts oncogenic insults. In addition, senescent cells can also negatively impact the surrounding tissue microenvironment and the neighboring cells by secreting pro-inflammatory cytokines, ultimately triggering tissue dysfunction and/or unfavorable outcomes. This review focuses on the characteristics of senescence and on the recent advances in the contribution of p53 to cellular senescence. Moreover, we also discuss the p53-mediated regulation of several pathophysiological microenvironments that could be associated with senescence and its development.
