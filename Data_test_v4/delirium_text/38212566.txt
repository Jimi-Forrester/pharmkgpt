38212566|a|The intricate relationship between the central nervous system (CNS) and the immune system plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of various neurological diseases. Understanding the interactions among the immunopathological processes at the brain borders is essential for advancing our knowledge of disease mechanisms and developing novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. In this review, we explore the emerging role of neuroimaging in providing valuable insights into brain barrier inflammation and brain fluid drainage in human neurological diseases. Neuroimaging techniques have enabled us not only to visualize and assess brain structures, but also to study the dynamics of the CNS in health and disease in vivo. By analyzing imaging findings, we can gain a deeper understanding of the immunopathology observed at the brain-immune interface barriers, which serve as critical gatekeepers that regulate immune cell trafficking, cytokine release, and clearance of waste products from the brain. This review explores the integration of neuroimaging data with immunopathological findings, providing valuable insights into brain barrier integrity and immune responses in neurological diseases. Such integration may lead to the development of novel diagnostic markers and targeted therapeutic approaches that can benefit patients with neurological disorders.
