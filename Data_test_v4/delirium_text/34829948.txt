34829948|a|Stroke, which is the second leading cause of mortality in the world, is urgently needed to explore the medical strategies for ischemic stroke treatment. Both icariin (ICA) and icaritin (ICT) are the major active flavonoids extracted from Herba epimedii that have been regarded as the neuroprotective agents in disease models. In this study, we aimed to investigate and compare the neuroprotective effects of ICA and ICT in a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) mouse model. Male ICR mice were pretreated with both ICA and ICT, which ameliorated body weight loss, neurological injury, infarct volume, and pathological change in acute ischemic stroke mice. Furthermore, administration of both ICA and ICT could also protect against neuronal cell apoptotic death, oxidative and nitrosative stress, lipid peroxidation, and extracellular matrix (ECM) accumulation in the brains. The neuroprotective effects of ICT are slightly better than that of ICA in acute cerebral ischemic stroke mice. These results suggest that pretreatment with both ICA and ICT improves the neuronal cell apoptosis and responses of oxidative/nitrosative stress and counteracts the ECM accumulation in the brains of acute cerebral ischemic stroke mice. Both ICA and ICT treatment may serve as a useful therapeutic strategy for acute ischemic stroke.
