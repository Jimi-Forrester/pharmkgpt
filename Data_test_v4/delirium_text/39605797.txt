39605797|a|Objective: To explore the preliminary application value of real-time ultrasound-guided combined with CT monitoring in percutaneous cervical disc puncture injection for diagnostic trials. Methods: Sixty patients with suspected cervical discogenic dizziness undergoing percutaneous cervical disc puncture between January 2023 and February 2024 were randomly divided into two groups: real-time ultrasound-guided combined with CT monitoring and CT-guided alone. The groups were compared for pre-puncture positioning time, total puncture process time, number of CT exposures, and complications. Subsequent treatment and medications were consistent between the two groups. Results: Sixty patients were divided into the the real-time US-guided combined with CT monitoring group (n=30) and the CT-guided group (n=30). Pre-puncture positioning time in the real-time US-guided combined with CT monitoring group was shorter than that in the CT-guided group, but there was no statistical difference between the two groups (P>0.05). The total puncture process time and the number of CT exposures in the real-time US-guided combined with CT monitoring group were smaller than those in the CT-guided group, and there was a statistical difference between the two groups (P<0.05). Two cases of hematoma appeared in CT guidance alone, and no hematoma appeared in the real-time US-guided combined with CT monitoring group. Conclusion: Real-time ultrasound-guided combined with computed tomography monitoring in percutaneous cervical disc puncture is a rapid, visible, safe, and effective method.
