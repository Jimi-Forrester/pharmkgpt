31737810|t|Fabrication of a Hydrazone-Based Al(III)-Selective "Turn-On" Fluorescent Chemosensor and Ensuing Potential Recognition of Picric Acid.
31737810|a|A hydrazone-based N'1,N'3-bis((E)-4-(diethylamino)-2 -hydroxybenzylidene)isophthalohydrazide (NDHIPH), has been synthesized, characterized, and assessed for its highly selective and sensitive (limit of detection, 2.53 nM) response toward Al(III) via fluorescence enhancement in 95% aqueous medium. All experimental results of analytical studies are in good consonance with the theoretical studies performed. Further, this NDHIPH-Al(III) ensemble is used for selective and sensitive (12.15 nM) detection of explosive picric acid (PA) via fluorescence quenching. This reversible behavior of NDHIPH toward Al(III) and PA is used for the creation of a molecular logic gate.
