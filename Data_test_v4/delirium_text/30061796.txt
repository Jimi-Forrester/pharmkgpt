30061796|t|Mortality and Functional Disability of Poststroke Delirium.
30061796|a|INTRODUCTION: Small number of studies have evaluated the mortality and the degree of functional disability of post-stroke delirium, and our aim was to determine that. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Comprehensive neuropsychological assessments were performed within the first week of stroke onset, at hospital discharge, and followed-up for 3, 6 and 12 months after stroke. We used diagnostic tools such as Glasgow Coma Scale, Delirium Rating Scale, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale and Mini-Mental State. RESULTS: Delirious patients had a significantly higher mortality (p = 0.0005). As opposed to the type of stroke mortality was higher after ischemic (p = 0.0005). The patients without delirium had significantly better cumulative survival during the first year after stroke (p = 0.0005). Delirious patients aged >=65 years had a significantly lower cumulative survival during the first year after stroke (p = 0.0005). In relation to the type of stroke delirious patients with ischemic had a significantly lower cumulative survival during the first year after stroke (p = 0.0005). Delirious patients had a greater degree of functional impairment at discharge (p = 0.01), three (p = 0.01), six months (p = 0.01) and one year (p = 0.01) after stroke. CONCLUSION: Delirious patients have a significantly higher mortality, lower cumulative survival and a greater degree of functional disability in the first year after stroke.
