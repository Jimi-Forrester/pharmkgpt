10381559|a|An inverse relationship appears to exist between cigarette smoking and the risk of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. Since both diseases are characterized by enhanced oxidative stress, we investigated the antioxidant potential of nicotine, a primary component of cigarette smoke. Initial chromatographic studies suggest that nicotine can affect the formation of the neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine resulting from the addition of dopamine to Fenton's reagent (i.e., Fe2+ and H2O2). Thus, under certain circumstances, nicotine can strongly affect the course of the Fenton reaction. In in vivo studies, adult male rats being treated with nicotine showed greater memory retention than controls in a water maze task. However, neurochemical analysis of neocortex, hippocampus, and neostriatum from these same animals revealed that nicotine treatment had no effect on the formation of reactive oxygen species or on lipid peroxidation for any brain region studied. In an in vitro study, addition of various concentrations of nicotine to rat neocortical homogenates had no effect on lipid peroxidation compared to saline controls. The results of these studies suggest that the beneficial/protective effects of nicotine in both Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease may be, at least partly, due to antioxidant mechanisms.
