36810467|t|Narrative Review Concerning the Clinical Spectrum of Ophthalmological Impairments in Parkinson's Disease.
36810467|a|Ophthalmic non-motor impairments are common in Parkinson's disease patients, from the onset of the neurodegenerative disease and even prior to the development of motor symptoms. This is a very crucial component of the potential for early detection of this disease, even in its earliest stages. Since the ophthalmological disease is extensive and impacts all extraocular and intraocular components of the optical analyzer, a competent assessment of it would be beneficial for the patients. Because the retina is an extension of the nervous system and has the same embryonic genesis as the central nervous system, it is helpful to investigate the retinal changes in Parkinson's disease in order to hypothesize insights that may also be applicable to the brain. As a consequence, the detection of these symptoms and signs may improve the medical evaluation of PD and predict the illness' prognosis. Another valuable aspect of this pathology is the fact that the ophthalmological damage contributes significantly to the decrease in the quality of life of patients with Parkinson's disease. We provide an overview of the most significant ophthalmologic impairments associated with Parkinson's disease. These results certainly constitute a large number of the prevalent visual impairments experienced by PD patients.
