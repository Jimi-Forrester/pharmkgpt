36536705|a|Background: Delirium is affecting of concentration, decreases the ability to forward-thinking, attention, sustainability, change, and decreases orientation to the environment. Delirium has a serious impact on the overall outcome of the patient. Post-operative emergence delirium (POED) increases hospital mortality by 5% and post-discharge hospitalization by 33%, compared to those without postoperative delirium. Postoperative delirium incidence has different summative risk factors and recognizing the multiple risks of delirium complications may help the clinician to design supportive measures to prevent delirium. Delirium can cause a series of outcomes and is increase the length of hospital stay, independent predictor for intensive care unit (ICU) admission and institutional morbidity and mortality, increase institutional care, for those patients and increase hospital expenses. Methodology: Unmatched case-control study was employed from September 2019 to October 2020. This study was conducted on 264 patients above 18years. A structured questionnaire prepared in English was used for data collection. Data were analyzed by using the SPSS software. Bivariate and multiple logistic regression models were used to identify associated risk factors for incidence of POED and a P-Value of less than 0.05 was the risk factor for this medical condition. Result: Out of 264 participants included in the study 56.4% were female. ASA I and II constitute 97.4%. Substance abuse, premediate with diazepam, & ketamine were high risk for POD with p-value of 0.000, 0.005, & 0.047 respectively. Conclusion: We conclude that older age, current substance use, Coexisting disease, Benzodiazepine exposures, Ketamine, ASA physical status, and coexisting disease were determinant risk factors for postoperative delirium clients undergoing general anesthesia.
