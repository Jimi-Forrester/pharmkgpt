9024335|t|Developing treatment guidelines for Alzheimer's disease and other dementias.
9024335|a|Developing treatment guidelines for Alzheimer's disease and other dementias depends primarily on a literature review. A recent review suggests that tacrine is modestly effective in treating cognitive symptoms and that-neuroleptic drugs are modestly effective in treating agitation and aggression. Few randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of other agents used for the treatment of cognitive and noncognitive symptoms of dementia have been performed. A variety of behavioral/environmental interventions show modest but nonspecific effects in treating Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia. Family-focused support interventions are moderately effective and may delay nursing home placement.
