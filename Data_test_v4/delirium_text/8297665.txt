8297665|t|[Two cases of acute alcoholic myopathy associated with rhabdomyolysis].
8297665|a|We reported two cases of acute alcoholic myopathy associated with rhabdomyolysis. The first case was 62 year-old man, who had been drinking every day for 40 years. Following diarrhea, he had psychic symptoms, and was admitted to our hospital. He was in a state of delirium. Tremor in extremities, dysarthria and weakness of lower extremities were observed. Neither swelling nor grasping pain were seen in any muscles. Laboratory data showed severe hypokalemia and high levels of serum muscle enzymes and myoglobin. An increase of lactate and pyruvate was not seen in ischemic exercise test performed at the acute or the recovery phase. It was suggested that glycolysis in muscles was suppressed in this case. The second case was 43 year-old man, who had been drinking every day for 27 years. Rapidly progressive weakness of both lower extremities was seen, and he was admitted to our hospital. Grasping pain of both legs and proximal muscle weakness of extremities were observed. Laboratory date showed normokalemia and high levels of serum muscle enzymes and myoglobin. Muscle biopsy showed no abnormal findings in histology and electron microscopy. Although the pathogenesis of acute alcoholic myopathy is unknown, suppression of muscle glycolysis enzyme caused by ethanol may play an important role in the first case.
