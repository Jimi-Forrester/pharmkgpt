38633527|a|INTRODUCTION: Awareness influences the evolution of neurodegenerative dementias. We gathered participants' and caregivers assessments of dependence in daily activities and we studied how each score would be related to next year participant autonomy, independently of other explicative variables. METHOD: We retrospectively analyzed data from mildly demented participants with a clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD, n = 186) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD, n = 29) and their relatives. A research tool was used to assess participant dependence in 98 daily activities and associated caregiver burden. A discrepancy score between the patient's and relative's judgment was calculated to evaluate awareness of dependence in activities at baseline. This dependence scores, as well as sex, age, education, and 1 year difference in Mini-Mental State Examination were taken as possible explicative variables for dependence in activities adapted by therapists during a 1-year cognitive rehabilitation program. RESULTS: Patients with FTD showed less awareness for daily dependence (discrepancy 20.9% vs. 11.8% in AD). Both groups benefited from cognitive rehabilitation (25% decrease in dependence) and subjective burden of relatives was decreased in both groups. In the AD group, there was a significant positive relationship between both caregiver (P < 0.001) and participant's (P < 0.02) evaluation of dependence in daily activities at inclusion and dependence of participants in adapted activities after 1 year. DISCUSSION: Awareness of impairment in daily activities is a clinical symptom that is more important at inclusion in FTD than in AD. However, in participants with AD who, as a group, significantly benefit from a cognitive rehabilitation program, not only caregiver's but also participant's assessment of dependence at baseline is correlated to subsequent, next year greater dependence in daily activities adapted by the therapists. Although discrepant, both caregiver and participant evaluations appear to be important variables to understand the evolution and the benefit of care in participants at early stages of dementia.
