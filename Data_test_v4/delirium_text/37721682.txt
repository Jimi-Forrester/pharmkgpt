37721682|a|In recent years, exploring natural compounds with functional properties to ameliorate aging-associated cognitive decline has become a research priority to ensure healthy aging. In the present study, we investigated the effects of Trigonelline (TG), a plant alkaloid, on memory and spatial learning in 16-week-old senescence-accelerated mouse model SAMP8 using an integrated approach for cognitive and molecular biology aspects. After 30 days of oral administration of TG at the dose of 5 mg/kg/day, the mice were trained in Morris Water Maze task. TG-treated SAMP8 mice exhibited significant improvement in the parameters of escape latency, distance moved, and annulus crossing index. Next, we performed a whole-genome transcriptome profiling of the mouse hippocampus using microarrays. Gene ontology analyses showed that a wide range of biological processes, including nervous system development, mitochondrial function, ATP synthesis, and several signaling pathways related to inflammation, autophagy, and neurotransmitter release, were significantly enriched in TG-treated SAMP8 compared to nontreated. Further, a nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique, Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP), was applied to identify clusters of functions that revealed TG primarily regulated pathways related to inflammation, followed by those involved in neurotransmitter release. In addition, a protein-protein interaction network analysis indicated that TG may exert its biological effects through negatively modulating Traf6-mediated NF-kappaB activation. Finally, ELISA test showed that TG treatment significantly decreased proinflammatory cytokines- TNFalpha and IL6 and increased neurotransmitters- dopamine, noradrenaline, and serotonin in mouse hippocampus. Altogether, our integrated bio-cognitive approach highlights the potential of TG in alleviating age-related memory and spatial impairment.
