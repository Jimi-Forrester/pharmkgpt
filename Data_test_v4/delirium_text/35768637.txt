35768637|a|Studies have shown that women on the Alzheimer's disease (AD) continuum have more pathological tau in the brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), than men. Some studies have found that higher levels of tau biomarkers are more strongly associated with clinical AD, cognitive decline and neurodegeneration in women than in men. Despite major developments in the use of plasma tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 (p-tau181) as an AD biomarker, it is unknown whether these sex differences apply to plasma p-tau181. In 1060 Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) participants (47% women, 73.8 +- 7.6 years old), we examined sex differences in plasma p-tau181 levels and their association with other biomarkers, cognitive decline and incident AD. Linear regressions tested for an effect of sex on plasma p-tau181 levels and for plasma p-tau181 x sex interactions on CSF p-tau181, as well as entorhinal cortex tau, cortical amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposition, and brain glucose metabolism, quantified using PET imaging. Linear mixed effects models tested for a sex x baseline plasma p-tau181 interaction on change in cognition over time. Finally, Cox models tested for a sex x plasma p-tau181 interaction on the risk of AD dementia in participants who were free of dementia at baseline. Despite similar plasma p-tau181 levels between sexes, women had lower brain glucose metabolism, greater brain Abeta and entorhinal cortex tau deposition, higher CSF p-tau181 and faster cognitive decline in relation to higher baseline plasma p-tau181 levels compared with men. Among Abeta positive, dementia-free participants, women had higher rates of incident AD dementia associated with increasing baseline plasma p-tau181 levels, relative to men. Our results suggest that sex may impact the clinical interpretation of plasma p-tau181 concentrations. If replicated, these findings could have important implications for the use of plasma p-tau181 as an accessible AD biomarker and screening tool for preventive and therapeutic clinical trials.
