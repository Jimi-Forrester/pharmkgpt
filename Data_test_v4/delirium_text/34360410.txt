34360410|a|BACKGROUND: People with dementia are a high-risk group for hip fractures. Although the increased risk of hip fractures associated with antipsychotic drugs (APD) is found in older populations, little is known about the risk for people with dementia living in Asia. We aimed to investigate the association between hip fractures and the characteristics of APD use in patients with dementia. METHODS: A nested case-control analysis was conducted on a nationwide cohort in Taiwan. People with diagnoses of dementia during 2003-2012 were identified. Conditional logistic regression analysis was performed, and adjusted odds ratios (aORs) were calculated with a 95% confidence interval (CI) to estimate the risk of hip fractures. RESULTS: APD use was associated with an increased risk of hip fractures in patients with dementia; current use or combined use of first and second generations of APDs had even higher risks. Regarding the duration of APD use, a U-shape curve of hip fracture risk was noted, and the risk peaked during 0-15 days and >215 days of exposure (aOR = 1.46, 95% CI 1.37-1.57; aOR = 1.47, 95% CI 1.37-1.58; respectively). Considering the doses of APDs, the hip fracture risk was significantly increased with all four levels of the cumulative doses and average daily doses and peaked in the group with the highest average daily dose. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that caution must be taken when initiating APD use in patients with dementia, even in a small dose, and mixed types of APD prescriptions should be administered with care. Furthermore, frequent evaluation of the possibility of tapering or withdrawal of the medication is necessary, as the risk does not attenuate after long-term use.
