39152687|a|The human genome harbors hundreds of thousands of integrations of ancient retroviruses, amassed over millions of years of evolution. To reduce further amplification in the genome, the host prevents transcription of these now endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) through epigenetic repression and, with evolutionary time, ERVs are incapacitated by accumulating mutations and deletions. However, several members of recently endogenized ERV groups still retain the capacity to produce viral RNA, retroviral proteins, and higher order structures, including virions. The retention of viral characteristics, combined with the reversible nature of epigenetic repression, particularly as seen in cancer, allow for immunologically unanticipated ERV expression, perceived by the adaptive immune system as a genuine retroviral infection, to which it has to respond. Accordingly, antibodies reactive with ERV antigens have been detected in diverse disorders and, occasionally, in healthy individuals. Although they are part of self, the retroviral legacy of ERV antigens, and association with and, possibly, causation of disease states may set them apart from typical self-antigens. Consequently, the pathogenic or, indeed, host-protective capacity of antibodies targeting ERV antigens is likely to be context-dependent. Here, we review the immunogenicity of typical ERV proteins, with emphasis on the antibody response and its potential disease implications.
