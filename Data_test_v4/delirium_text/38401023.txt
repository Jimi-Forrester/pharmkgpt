38401023|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurological condition that may lead to dementia as well as a slow and steady decline in cognitive ability. Finding early signs that may be used in the diagnosis of AD is still a difficult aim to achieve in the field of medical practice. METHODS AND RESULTS: The purpose of this research was to investigate to determine any differences in the gene expression patterns of crystallin mu (CRYM) and sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin 10 (SIGLEC10) in whole blood samples obtained from fifty individuals who were diagnosed with AD and fifty individuals as a control group. When compared with controls, it was discovered that the expression of the CRYM gene was substantially decreased in AD patients, but the expression of the SIGLEC10 gene was significantly higher. A positive correlation between CRYM and SIGLEC10 was noticed solely in patients with AD. Furthermore, assessing the diagnostic value of these genes, CRYM and SIGLEC10 transcript levels displayed an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.74 and 0.81, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that alterations in CRYM and SIGLEC10 expression may be implicated in AD pathology and that these genes expression levels can potentially serve as biomarkers for early detection and diagnosis of AD. Nevertheless, further validation of these findings requires the inclusion of more extensive and heterogeneous cohorts. The findings derived from this study possess the capability to offer a significant contribution towards the progression of innovative diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for AD.
