38254523|a|Several species of hybrid fruits, such as citrus, grapes, blueberries, apples, tomatoes, and lingonberries among others, have attracted scientific attention in recent years, especially due to their reported antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. The bagasse, leaves, bark, and seeds of these hybrid fruits have large amounts of polyphenols, such as flavonoids, which act as potent antioxidants. Several studies have been carried out in cellular models of neurotoxicity of the extract of these fruits, to document the beneficial effects for human health, as well as to prove its antiproliferative effect in cancer cells. In the present review, through a synthesis of existing information in the scientific literature, we demonstrate that hybrid fruits are a source of antioxidant and bioactive compounds, which act in the inhibition of diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and inflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases, and consequently improving human health.
