31182094|a|BACKGROUND: Degenerative myelopathy (DM) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease frequently found in Pembroke Welsh Corgis (PWCs). Most DM-affected PWCs are homozygous for the mutant superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) allele; however, the genetic examination for the SOD1 mutation does not exclusively detect symptomatic dogs. In order to identify novel biomarkers, the plasma microRNA (miRNA) profiles of PWCs with DM were investigated. RESULTS: Quantification of the plasma levels of 277 miRNAs by an RT-qPCR array identified 11 up-regulated miRNAs and 7 down-regulated miRNAs in DM-affected PWCs from those in wild-type SOD1 PWCs. A pathway analysis identified 3 miRNAs: miR-26b, miR-181a, and miR-196a, which potentially regulate several genes associated with SOD1. In order to validate the diagnostic accuracy of the candidate miRNAs in the aged PWC population, candidate miRNAs in plasma were measured by RT-qPCR and a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed. miR-26b had the largest area under the ROC curve for distinguishing DM PWCs from healthy PWCs (sensitivity, 66.7%; specificity, 87.0%). The plasma level of miR-26b was significantly higher in the DM group than in the healthy control group. A positive correlation was observed between increases in the plasma level of miR-26b and disease progression. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that plasma miR-26b is a potential novel diagnostic biomarker of DM.
