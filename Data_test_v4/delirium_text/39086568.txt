39086568|a|Introduction: Thyroid storm is an uncommon but life-threatening presentation of thyrotoxicosis with a mortality rate of 10%. Our objective was to study the demographics, clinical and biochemical characteristics, and outcomes of inpatients diagnosed with thyroid storm in the Indian context. Methods: This retrospective study was conducted by analysing the institutional electronic medical records (EMR) of all patients admitted with thyroid storm from 2004 to 2020 with a Burch-Wartofsky score (BWS) of >=45. Results: Thirty-five patients with a BWS >=45 were included, of whom 71.4% were women, with a mean age of 44.9 +- 10.2 years. 43% did not have any prior history of thyrotoxicosis. Graves' disease was the most common underlying aetiology (71.4%), followed by toxic multinodular goitre (14.3%). Cardiovascular (94.3%) and gastrointestinal-hepatic dysfunction (88.6%) were the most common clinical manifestations. Features of Central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction were seen in only 42.3% of patients diagnosed with a thyroid storm. The Japanese Thyroid Association (JTA) criteria diagnosed only 26 patients (74.3%) with "definite" thyroid storm. The mortality rate was 8.6%, and all three patients expired within 48 hours of admission. Conclusion: Nearly one in every two patients with thyroid storm had previously undiagnosed thyrotoxicosis. Toxic multinodular goitre is a notable aetiology in Indians. Features of CNS dysfunction, considered relatively specific for thyroid storm, were less prominent in our series. The JTA criteria might alter the classification of some patients diagnosed with a thyroid storm, when compared to the BWS score due to fewer CNS features among Indian patients.
