37609423|a|In this article the content of toxic xenobiotics (heavy metals and pesticides) in cow milk collected from 5 districts of Eastern Kazakhstan was examined and their cumulative properties were determined. The content of organochlorine pesticides (HCCH, DDT) was not detected in the analyzed milk. The content of mercury and arsenic in milk samples does not exceed the maximum allowable concentration (0.005 and 0.05 mg/kg, respectively). The content of cadmium above the maximum allowable concentration (0.03 mg/kg) was found in milk sampled from Shemonaikha and Katon-Karagai districts. The content of lead and zinc above the maximum allowable concentration (0.1 and 5.0 mg/kg, respectively) was found in milk samples taken from all 5 studied districts. The content of copper above the maximum allowable concentration (1.0 mg/kg) was found in milk samples collected from 4 districts under study (Borodulikha, Beskaragai, Shemonaikha and Katon-Karagai). Based on the analysis of information data the need to develop an accelerated method of determining toxic xenobiotics in milk was substantiated. The basic directions of modernization of the biosensor for determination of cadmium and lead salts in milk and dairy products were selected. A new approach to the process of immobilization of the enzyme on the surface of a substrate for cadmium and lead salts determination in milk has been developed. The efficiency of using a polymeric plate with a graphite conducting layer as a basis for the enzyme biosensor was established.
