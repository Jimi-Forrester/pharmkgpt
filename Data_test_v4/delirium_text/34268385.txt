34268385|t|Analysis of gender-specific associations between aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) rs671 genetic polymorphisms and serum uric acid levels in Han Chinese.
34268385|a|BACKGROUND: Serum uric acid (SUA) is influenced by lifestyle and genetics, and unbalanced SUA levels are linked to various common disorders. While the aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) rs671 polymorphism appears to be associated with SUA levels, the evidence remains inconclusive. The aim of this study was to examine the distribution of the ALDH2 rs671 polymorphism among Han Chinese in Beijing and determine the association between this polymorphism and SUA. METHODS: A total of 6,461 randomized healthy individuals were included in the study. Biochemical indicators were tested and ALDH2 rs671 polymorphism testing was conducted for subjects enrolled in the study. The distribution of the ALDH2 rs671 polymorphism and the relationship between genotype and the levels of serum lipids and uric acid (UA) were analyzed. RESULTS: The ALDH2 rs671 genotype frequencies were 68.1% (G/G), 29.3% (G/A), and 2.6% (A/A). There was no significant difference in allele distribution between males and females. In males, different ALDH2 genotypes exhibited significant differences in several biochemical analytes, including body mass index (BMI), blood glucose (Glu), total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), UA, glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), and creatinine (Cr) (P<0.05). No such differences were found in females. SUA levels in G/A and A/A-carrying males were significantly lower than those of G/G-carrying males. The effect of the ALDH2 polymorphism on UA was still significant after further adjustment for factors including BMI, Glu, TC, HDL-C, Cr, and GGT. CONCLUSIONS: The ALDH2 polymorphism is related to SUA in Beijing males, and A allele-carrying males have lower SUA levels.
