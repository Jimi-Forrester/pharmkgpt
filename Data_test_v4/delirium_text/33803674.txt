33803674|t|Acyl-Acyl Carrier Protein Desaturases and Plant Biotic Interactions.
33803674|a|Interactions between land plants and other organisms such as pathogens, pollinators, or symbionts usually involve a variety of specialized effectors participating in complex cross-talks between organisms. Fatty acids and their lipid derivatives play important roles in these biological interactions. While the transcriptional regulation of genes encoding acyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) desaturases appears to be largely responsive to biotic stress, the different monounsaturated fatty acids produced by these enzymes were shown to take active part in plant biotic interactions and were assigned with specific functions intrinsically linked to the position of the carbon-carbon double bond within their acyl chain. For example, oleic acid, an omega-9 monounsaturated fatty acid produced by Delta9-stearoyl-ACP desaturases, participates in signal transduction pathways affecting plant immunity against pathogen infection. Myristoleic acid, an omega-5 monounsaturated fatty acid produced by Delta9-myristoyl-ACP desaturases, serves as a precursor for the biosynthesis of omega-5 anacardic acids that are active biocides against pests. Finally, different types of monounsaturated fatty acids synthesized in the labellum of orchids are used for the production of a variety of alkenes participating in the chemistry of sexual deception, hence favoring plant pollination by hymenopterans.
