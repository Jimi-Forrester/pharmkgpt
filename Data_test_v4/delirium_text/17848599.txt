17848599|a|Brain levels of transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) are increased in Alzheimer's disease and have been implicated in the associated cerebrovascular pathology. We recently reported that transgenic mice that overexpress TGF-beta1 (TGF+ mice) display, with aging, selectively reduced endothelin-1 (ET-1)-mediated contractions. Because ET-1 is a key regulator of cerebrovascular tone and homeostasis, we investigated how increased levels of TGF-beta1 could selectively alter this contractile response. We found that ETA receptors, via activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase, mediate the ET-1-induced contraction in mouse cerebral arteries, a response significantly decreased in aged TGF+ mice (-39%; p < 0.01) despite unaltered ETA receptor levels or affinity. In cerebrovascular smooth muscle cell cultures, long-term treatment with TGF-beta1 significantly decreased (>50%; p < 0.05) the ET-1-induced activation of the p38 MAPK/27-kDa heat shock protein (HSP27) signaling pathway. This occurred with no effect upstream to p38 MAP kinase but with the concomitant induction of mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-1 (MKP-1) expression. Inhibition of MKP-1 expression with Ro-31-8220 or suppression of MKP-1 expression by short interfering RNA restored the ET-1-mediated p38 MAP kinase response. These results disclose a new role for long-term increases of TGF-beta1 in modulating cerebrovascular tone by dampening ET-1-mediated activation of the p38 MAPK/HSP27 signaling pathway. Such changes in ET-1-mediated signaling may help maintain vascular wall homeostasis by compensating for the diminished dilatory function induced by TGF-beta1 and amyloid-beta; brain levels of these two molecules are increased in patients with Alzheimer's disease.
