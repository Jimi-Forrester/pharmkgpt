28913897|t|Studying the Progression of Amyloid Pathology and Its Therapy Using Translational Longitudinal Model of Accumulation and Distribution of Amyloid Beta.
28913897|a|Long-term effects of amyloid targeted therapy can be studied using a mechanistic translational model of amyloid beta (Abeta) distribution and aggregation calibrated on published data in mouse and human species. Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology is modeled utilizing age-dependent pathological evolution for rate constants and several variants of explicit functions for Abeta toxicity influencing cognitive outcomes (Adas-cog). Preventive Abeta targeted therapies were simulated to minimize the Abeta difference from healthy physiological levels. Therapeutic targeted simulations provided similar predictions for mouse and human studies. Our model predicts that: (1) at least 1 year (2 years for preclinical AD) of treatment is needed to observe cognitive effects; (2) under the hypothesis with functional importance of Abeta, a 15% decrease in Abeta (using an imaging biomarker) is related to 15-20% cognition improvement by immunotherapy. Despite negative outcomes in clinical trials, Abeta continues to remain a prospective target demanding careful assessment of mechanistic effect and duration of trial design.
