16814639|t|Dexmedetomidine as an adjuvant in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal delirium: a case report.
16814639|a|In this case report, even a moderate dose of dexmedetomidine, a very selective alpha(2)-adrenergic agent, resulted in a rapid response to alcohol withdrawal delirium after the standard treatment. Psychiatrists should be aware of this relatively new drug that provides advantages over clonidine, heavy sedation and secondary restraints. Dexmedetomidine should be further evaluated in the treatment of specific forms of aggressive behavior and complicated withdrawal states.
