39674564|a|Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II alpha (CaMKIIalpha) "autonomous" activation induced by Thr286 phosphorylation has a crucial role in synaptic plasticity. Previous studies showed that in Alzheimer's disease brain, CaMKIIalpha autophosphorylation at Thr286 is reduced while the level of cysteine-oxidized CAMKIIalpha is elevated. We performed tryptic mapping of the oxidized CaMKIIalpha and discovered the formation of a disulfide between the N-terminal Cys6 and the regulatory domain Cys280. The apparent pKa values of Cys6 and Cys280 are 7.1 and 7.7, respectively, lower than the 8.5 for free Cys. The low apparent pKa of Cys6 facilitates the oxidation of its thiol to the sulfenic acid at physiological pH. The thiolate of Cys280 can then attack the sulfenic acid to form a disulfide. Using an antibody against phosphorylated Thr286, we showed that disulfide formation prevents Thr286 phosphorylation. CaMKIIalpha autonomous activation induced by disulfide formation is much lower than the autonomous activation induced by phosphorylation. The decreased autonomous activation may contribute to the synaptic impairment of Alzheimer's disease. We also generated a CaMKIIalpha mutant in which Cys6 was mutated to Ser6. This mutation prevented disulfide formation and restored autonomous activation induced by phosphorylation. Our findings provide insight into the mechanistic details of CaMKIIalpha autonomous activation induced by disulfide formation that may contribute to the impairment of long-term potentiation in Alzheimer's disease.
