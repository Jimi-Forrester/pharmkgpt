38775256|a|INTRODUCTION: Evaluating whether genetic susceptibility modifies the impact of lifestyle-related factors on dementia is critical for prevention. METHODS: We studied 5170 participants from a French cohort of older persons free of dementia at baseline and followed for up to 17 years. The LIfestyle for BRAin health risk score (LIBRA) including 12 modifiable factors was constructed at baseline (higher score indicating greater risk) and was related to both subsequent cognitive decline and dementia incidence, according to genetic susceptibility to dementia (reflected by the apolipoprotein E [APOE] epsilon4 allele and a genetic risk score [GRS]). RESULTS: The LIBRA was associated with higher dementia incidence, with no significant effect modification by genetics (hazard ratio for one point score = 1.09 [95% confidence interval, 1.05; 1.13]) in APOE epsilon4 non-carriers and = 1.15 [1.08; 1.22] in carriers; P = 0.15 for interaction). Similar findings were obtained with the GRS and with cognitive decline. DISCUSSION: Lifestyle-based prevention may be effective whatever the genetic susceptibility to dementia.
