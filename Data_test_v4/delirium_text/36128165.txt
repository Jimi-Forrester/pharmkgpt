36128165|t|Pleural effusion and respiratory compromise from spontaneous migration of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt catheter in a patient with normal-pressure hydrocephalus.
36128165|a|Background: Ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) insertion is one of the most common neurosurgical procedures done around the world to treat hydrocephalus. The occurrence of spontaneous migration of the peritoneal shunt catheter into the thoracic cavity is a very rare complication; we report here case number 27 of respiratory complications of a VPS in a patient with normal-pressure hydrocephalus (NPH). Case Description: A 76-year-old woman with Alzheimer's disease and anosognosia was diagnosed idiopathic NPH treated surgically with a VPS. Pleural effusion and pulmonary complications occurred 4 weeks after the insertion of the shunt due to the spontaneous migration of the peritoneal catheter of the VPS into the thoracic cavity. The hydrothorax of cerebrospinal fluid was drained and the distal catheter was removed and replaced. The patient made an uneventful recovery. Conclusion: Due to the rarity of this complication, there are no standard corrective procedures. Some of the methods used to diagnose and successfully treat this rare complication of the VPS are presented.
