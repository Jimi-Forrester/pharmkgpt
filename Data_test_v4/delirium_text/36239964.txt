36239964|a|Purpose: The purpose of this study was to investigate quantitative autofluorescence (qAF8) in patients with and without early or intermediate age-related macular degeneration (AMD); to determine the impact of the aged crystalline lens and posterior capsular opacification (PCO). Methods: In phakic and pseudophakic eyes >=60 years, AMD status was determined by the Beckman system. PCO presence and severity was extracted from clinical records. qAF8 was calculated using custom FIJI plugins. Differences in qAF8, stratified by lens status, PCO severity, and AMD status, were analyzed using generalized estimating equations. Results: In 210 eyes of 115 individuals (mean age = 75.7 +- 6.6 years), qAF8 was lower in intermediate AMD compared to early AMD (P = 0.05). qAF8 did not differ between phakic and pseudophakic eyes (P = 0.8909). In phakic (n = 83) and pseudophakic (n = 127) eyes considered separately, qAF8 did not differ by AMD status (P = 0.0936 and 0.3494, respectively). Qualitative review of qAF images in phakic eyes illustrated high variability. In pseudophakic eyes, qAF8 did not differ with PCO present versus absent (54.5% vs. 45.5%). Review of implanted intraocular lenses (IOLs) revealed that 43.9% were blue-filter IOLs. Conclusions: qAF8 was not associated with AMD status, up to intermediate AMD, considering only pseudophakic eyes to avoid noisy images in phakic eyes. In pseudophakic eyes, qAF8 was not affected by PCO. Because blue-filter IOLs may reduce levels of exciting light for qAF8, future studies investigating qAF in eyes with different IOL types are needed. Translational Relevance: To reduce variability in observational studies and clinical trials requiring qAF8, pseudophakic participants without blue-filter IOLs or advanced PCO should be preferentially enrolled.
