33101016|a|Gastrodia elata Blume (G. elata) is a valuable traditional Chinese medicine with neuroprotection, anti-inflammatory, and immune regulatory functions. MicroRNAs (miRNA) is a kind of endogenous noncoding small RNAs that plays distinctly important roles for gene regulation of organisms. So far, the research on G. elata is mainly focused on the pharmacological functions of the natural chemical ingredients, and the function of G. elata miRNA remains unknown. In this study, 5,718 known miRNAs and 38 novel miRNAs were identified by high-throughput sequencing from G. elata. Based on GO and KEGG analysis, we found that the human genes possibly regulated by G. elata miRNAs were related to the cell cycle, immune regulation, intercellular communication, etc. Furthermore, two novel miRNAs as Gas-miR01 and Gas-miR02 have stable and high expression in the medicinal tissues of G. elata. Further bioinformatics prediction showed that both Gas-miR01 and Gas-miR02 could target Homo sapiens A20 gene, furthermore, the dual-luciferase reporter gene assay and Western Blotting verified the interaction of Gas-miR01 or Gas-miR02 with A20. These evidences suggested that G. elata-unique miRNAs might be involved in certain physiological processes. The animal experiment showed that Gas-miR01 and Gas-miR02 could be detected in some tissues of mice by intragastric administration; meanwhile, the A20 expression in some tissues of mice was downregulated. These results supported for the functional study of G. elata miRNAs.
