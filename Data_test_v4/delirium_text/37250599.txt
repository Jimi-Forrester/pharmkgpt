37250599|t|Mortality in the Oldest-Old Adults After Discharge From Acute Geriatric Ward.
37250599|a|Aim: To examine risk factors for post-discharge mortality in the oldest-old patients. Methods: We have assessed the risk factors for mortality after discharge from acute geriatric ward in 448 patients aged >=90. Results: Low albumin, high urea, and full dependence were risk factors for mortality within 1 month and within 1 year after discharge from hospital. Age-adjusted Charlson Comorbidity Index score, neuroleptic drug treatments and frailty were specific risk factors for post-discharge mortality within 1 year. By Cox regression analysis, the risk factors associated with higher hazard ratios for post-discharge mortality within 14 years follow-up were age-adjusted Charlson Comorbidity Index score, poor functional status, anemia and dementia as comorbidities, neuroleptic drug treatments, low albumin, high urea, and high vitamin B12. Conclusion: Optimal treatment of the condition due to which the patient has been hospitalized and of the medical complications that occurred during hospitalization, while preventing functional decline, might secure longer post-discharge survival.
