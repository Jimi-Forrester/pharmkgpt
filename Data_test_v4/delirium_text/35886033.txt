35886033|t|Intracerebral Hemorrhage Genetics.
35886033|a|Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a devastating type of stroke, frequently resulting in unfavorable functional outcomes. Up to 15% of stroke patients experience ICH and approximately half of those have a lethal outcome within a year. Considering the huge burden of ICH, timely prevention and optimized treatment strategies are particularly relevant. Nevertheless, ICH management options are quite limited, despite thorough research. More and more trials highlight the importance of the genetic component in the pathogenesis of ICH. Apart from distinct monogenic disorders of familial character, mostly occurring in younger subjects, there are numerous polygenic risk factors, such as hypertension, neurovascular inflammation, disorders of lipid metabolism and coagulation cascade, and small vessel disease. In this paper we describe gene-related ICH types and underlying mechanisms. We also briefly discuss the emerging treatment options and possible clinical relevance of the genetic findings in ICH management. Although existing data seems of more theoretical and scientific value so far, a growing body of evidence, combined with rapidly evolving experimental research, will probably serve clinicians in the future.
