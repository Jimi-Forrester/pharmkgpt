18454103|a|The analysis of diagnostics and treatment of 602 patients with destructive pancreatitis has shown that definition of etiological and pathogenetic forms of pancreatitis defines strategy of treatment. In this way, patients with biliary pancreatitis require emergency operative treatment with use of endoscopic interventions without dependence from a stage of disease. To patients with alcoholic or alimentary pancreatitis in the stage of enzymatic toxemia conservative treatment should be spent only, until shock and/or delirium won't be reduced. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography + endoscopic papillosphincterotomy with concrement removal from common bile duct--is the operation of choice in case of acute biliary pancreatitis at the first stage. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the operation of choice at the second stage of disease. At destructive pancreatitis of other origin in a stage of the infection or necrotic suppurative inflammation use of open and closed small invasive methods of intervention is most proved. Given tactics of treatment has allowed to lower severity of clinical course, frequency of complications and lethality.
