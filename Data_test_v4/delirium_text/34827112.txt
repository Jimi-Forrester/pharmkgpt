34827112|a|TREK-2-like channels in the pyramidal neurons of rat prefrontal cortex are characterized by a wide range of spontaneous activity-from very low to very high-independent of the membrane potential and the stimuli that are known to activate TREK-2 channels, such as temperature or membrane stretching. The aim of this study was to discover what factors are involved in high levels of TREK-2-like channel activity in these cells. Our research focused on the PI(4,5)P2-dependent mechanism of channel activity. Single-channel patch clamp recordings were performed on freshly dissociated pyramidal neurons of rat prefrontal cortexes in both the cell-attached and inside-out configurations. To evaluate the role of endogenous stimulants, the activity of the channels was recorded in the presence of a PI(4,5)P2 analogue (PI(4,5)P2DiC8) and Ca2+. Our research revealed that calcium ions are an important factor affecting TREK-2-like channel activity and kinetics. The observation that calcium participates in the activation of TREK-2-like channels is a new finding. We showed that PI(4,5)P2-dependent TREK-2 activity occurs when the conditions for PI(4,5)P2/Ca2+ nanocluster formation are met. We present a possible model explaining the mechanism of calcium action.
