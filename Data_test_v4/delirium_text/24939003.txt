24939003|a|On the first few days after admission to the Geriatric-Internal Medicine department, the suffering level of patients with advanced dementia (Mini-Mental State Examination 0 of 30) was evaluated according to the Mini-Suffering State Examination (MSSE). During hospitalization, 14.8% (27 of 183) of patients with advanced dementia were died with a mean survival rate of 19.86 +- 26.9 days. The MSSE scale score of died patients was 7.56 +- 1.71 during the first few days of admission which indicates high suffering levels. The MSSE scale score of survived patients with advanced dementia was 3.99 +- 2.10 which confirms their low level of suffering. There was a significant difference (P < .001) between the groups. Patients with dementia who died and were diagnosed as having Aminoff suffering syndrome during the first few days of admission had a high suffering level and short-survival time.
