39397309|t|Investigation of Antimicrobial Compounds Produced by Endolichenic Fungi in Different Culture Media.
39397309|a|Continuous use of synthetic fungicides has led to explosive emergence of fungicide-resistant microbes. Therefore, there are urgent needs for environmentally friendly antimicrobial agents with novel modes of action. This study investigated endolichenic fungi (ELF) as a source of antimicrobial compounds against various plant pathogens. We utilized an One Strain MAny Compounds (OSMAC) approach to enhance the chemical diversity of fourteen ELF. This involved cultivation of ELF in four growth media and subsequently assessing antimicrobial activities of culture extracts. Nearly half of the culture extracts exhibited antimicrobial activity against a Gram-positive bacterium, but showed minimal activity against Gram-negative bacteria tested. Notably, culture extracts from two ELF, Chaetomium globosum and Nodulisporium sp., demonstrated significant inhibitory effects against plant pathogenic fungi. LC-MS/MS-based metabolome profiling confirmed the presence of known bioactive compounds like cyclic dipeptides and chaetoglobosins. These findings highlight the effectiveness of combining OSMAC and metabolomics for identifying antimicrobial agents for agricultural use.
