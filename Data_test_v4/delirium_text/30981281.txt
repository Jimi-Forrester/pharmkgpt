30981281|t|Activation of GPR40 produces mechanical antiallodynia via the spinal glial interleukin-10/beta-endorphin pathway.
30981281|a|BACKGROUND: The G protein-coupled receptor 40 (GPR40), broadly expressed in various tissues such as the spinal cord, exerts multiple physiological functions including pain regulation. This study aimed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying GPR40 activation-induced antinociception in neuropathic pain, particularly related to the spinal glial expression of IL-10 and subsequent beta-endorphin. METHODS: Spinal nerve ligation-induced neuropathic pain model was used in this study. beta-Endorphin and IL-10 levels were measured in the spinal cord and cultured primary microglia, astrocytes, and neurons. Double immunofluorescence staining of beta-endorphin with glial and neuronal cellular biomarkers was also detected in the spinal cord and cultured primary microglia, astrocytes, and neurons. RESULTS: GPR40 was expressed on microglia, astrocytes, and neurons in the spinal cords and upregulated by spinal nerve ligation. Intrathecal injection of the GPR40 agonist GW9508 dose-dependently attenuated mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia in neuropathic rats, with Emax values of 80% and 100% MPE and ED50 values of 6.7 and 5.4 mug, respectively. Its mechanical antiallodynia was blocked by the selective GPR40 antagonist GW1100 but not GPR120 antagonist AH7614. Intrathecal GW9508 significantly enhanced IL-10 and beta-endorphin immunostaining in spinal microglia and astrocytes but not in neurons. GW9508 also markedly stimulated gene and protein expression of IL-10 and beta-endorphin in cultured primary spinal microglia and astrocytes but not in neurons, originated from 1-day-old neonatal rats. The IL-10 antibody inhibited GW9508-stimulated gene expression of the beta-endorphin precursor proopiomelanocortin (POMC) but not IL-10, whereas the beta-endorphin antibody did not affect GW9508-stimulated IL-10 or POMC gene expression. GW9508 increased phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) including p38, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and its stimulatory effects on IL-10 and POMC expression were blocked by each MAPK isoform inhibitor. Spinal GW9508-induced mechanical antiallodynia was completely blocked by intrathecal minocycline, IL-10 neutralizing antibody, beta-endorphin antiserum, and mu-opioid receptor-preferred antagonist naloxone. CONCLUSIONS: Our results illustrate that GPR40 activation produces antinociception via the spinal glial IL-10/beta-endorphin antinociceptive pathway.
