36340083|t|Sugar-Based Phase-Selective Supramolecular Self-Assembly System for Dye Removal and Selective Detection of Cu2+ Ions.
36340083|a|Simple, effective, and eco-friendly sugar-based phase-selective gelators were synthesized at a low cost. They showed high gelling ability toward a wide range of solvents at lower concentrations (minimum gelation concentration ~0.3%). Preliminary tests reveal that these low molecular weight organogelators can immediately and phase-selectively gel benzene, toluene, petrol, and kerosene in water at room temperature. We also identified G13 in toluene as the good gelator, and the corresponding organogel proficiently removes water-soluble dyes from their concentrated aqueous solutions. This efficient removal of toxic organic solvents and dyes from water suggests promising applications in removing organic substances from contaminated water resources. The thermoreversible gel exhibits effective rechargeability up to five cycles of burning and gelation, which imply the flame stability of the gel. Interestingly, these compounds had a high detection ability toward Cu2+ ions with a state change from gel to the solution. The physical justification for gelation mechanisms and the molecular interaction with metal ions were further confirmed by computational studies.
