31956272|t|Amino acid transporters as tetraspanin TM4SF5 binding partners.
31956272|a|Transmembrane 4 L6 family member 5 (TM4SF5) is a tetraspanin that has four transmembrane domains and can be N-glycosylated and palmitoylated. These posttranslational modifications of TM4SF5 enable homophilic or heterophilic binding to diverse membrane proteins and receptors, including growth factor receptors, integrins, and tetraspanins. As a member of the tetraspanin family, TM4SF5 promotes protein-protein complexes for the spatiotemporal regulation of the expression, stability, binding, and signaling activity of its binding partners. Chronic diseases such as liver diseases involve bidirectional communication between extracellular and intracellular spaces, resulting in immune-related metabolic effects during the development of pathological phenotypes. It has recently been shown that, during the development of fibrosis and cancer, TM4SF5 forms protein-protein complexes with amino acid transporters, which can lead to the regulation of cystine uptake from the extracellular space to the cytosol and arginine export from the lysosomal lumen to the cytosol. Furthermore, using proteomic analyses, we found that diverse amino acid transporters were precipitated with TM4SF5, although these binding partners need to be confirmed by other approaches and in functionally relevant studies. This review discusses the scope of the pathological relevance of TM4SF5 and its binding to certain amino acid transporters.
