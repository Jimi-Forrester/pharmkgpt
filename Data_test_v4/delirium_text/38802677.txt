38802677|t|LncRNA TUG1 mediates microglial inflammatory activation by regulating glucose metabolic reprogramming.
38802677|a|Microglia are natural immune cells in the central nervous system, and the activation of microglia is accompanied by a reprogramming of glucose metabolism. In our study, we investigated the role of long non-coding RNA taurine-upregulated gene 1 (TUG1) in regulating microglial glucose metabolism reprogramming and activation. BV2 cells were treated with Lipopolysaccharides (LPS)/Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) to establish a microglial activation model. The glycolysis inhibitor 2-Deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) was used as a control. The expression levels of TUG1 mRNA and proinflammatory cytokines such as Interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), Interleukin -6, and Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha mRNA and anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, Arginase 1(Arg1), CD206, and Ym1 were detected by RT-qPCR. TUG1 was silenced using TUG1 siRNA and knocked out using CRISPR/Cas9. The mRNA and protein expression levels of key enzymes involved in glucose metabolism, such as Hexokinase2, Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), Lactate dehydrogenase, Glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase, and Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), were determined by RT-qPCR and Western blotting. The glycolytic rate of microglial cells was measured using Seahorse. Differential metabolites were determined by metabolomics, and pathway enrichment was performed using these differential metabolites. Our findings revealed that the expression of TUG1 was elevated in proinflammatory-activated microglia and positively correlated with the levels of inflammatory factors. The expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, Arg1, CD206, and Ym1 were decreased when induced with LPS/IFN-gamma. However, this decrease was reversed by the treatment with 2-DG. Silencing of GAPDH led to an increase in the expression of TUG1 and inflammatory factors. TUG1 knockout (TUG1KO) inhibited the expression of glycolytic key enzymes and promoted the expression of oxidative phosphorylation key enzymes, shifting the metabolic profile of activated microglia from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation. Additionally, TUG1KO reduced the accumulation of metabolites, facilitating the restoration of the tricarboxylic acid cycle and enhancing oxidative phosphorylation in microglia. Furthermore, the downregulation of TUG1 was found to reduce the expression of both proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines under normal conditions. Interestingly, when induced with LPS/IFN-gamma, TUG1 downregulation showed a potentially beneficial effect on microglia in terms of inflammation. Downregulation of TUG1 expression inhibits glycolysis and facilitates the shift of microglial glucose metabolism from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation, promoting their transformation towards an anti-inflammatory phenotype and exerting anti-inflammatory effects in BV2.
