8893313|t|Methodological control of semantic priming in Alzheimer's disease.
8893313|a|We conducted a lexical-decision, semantic priming experiment that included 250- and 1000-ms stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs) with 32 probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 40 older normal persons. Attention-based, controlled processes are assumed to occur only at the longer of the 2 SOAs. The AD group showed greater than normal priming in the long-SOA but not the short-SOA condition. We conclude that greater than normal AD priming is a function of controlled processing rather than semantic network degradation.
