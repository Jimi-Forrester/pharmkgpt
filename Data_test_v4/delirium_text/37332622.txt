37332622|a|A growing public health concern, chronic Diesel Exhaust Particle (DEP) exposure is a heavy risk factor for the development of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's (AD). Considered the brain's first line of defense, the Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) and perivascular microglia work in tandem to protect the brain from circulating neurotoxic molecules like DEP. Importantly, there is a strong association between AD and BBB dysfunction, particularly in the Abeta transporter and multidrug resistant pump, P-glycoprotein (P-gp). However, the response of this efflux transporter is not well understood in the context of environmental exposures, such as to DEP. Moreover, microglia are seldom included in in vitro BBB models, despite their significance in neurovascular health and disease. Therefore, the goal of this study was to evaluate the effect of acute (24 hr.) DEP exposure (2000 mug/ml) on P-gp expression and function, paracellular permeability, and inflammation profiles of the human in vitro BBB model (hCMEC/D3) with and without microglia (hMC3). Our results suggested that DEP exposure can decrease both the expression and function of P-gp in the BBB, and corroborated that DEP exposure impairs BBB integrity (i.e. increased permeability), a response that was significantly worsened by the influence of microglia in co-culture. Interestingly, DEP exposure seemed to produce atypical inflammation profiles and an unexpected general downregulation in inflammatory markers in both the monoculture and co-culture, which differentially expressed IL-1beta and GM-CSF. Interestingly, the microglia in co-culture did not appear to influence the response of the BBB, save in the permeability assay, where it worsened the BBB's response. Overall, our study is important because it is the first (to our knowledge) to investigate the effect of acute DEP exposure on P-gp in the in vitro human BBB, while also investigating the influence of microglia on the BBB's responses to this environmental chemical.
