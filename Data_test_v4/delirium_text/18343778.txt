18343778|t|CSF multianalyte profile distinguishes Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases.
18343778|a|The therapeutic imperative for Alzheimer disease (AD) and Parkinson disease (PD) calls for discovery and validation of biomarkers. Increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tau and decreased amyloid (A) beta42 have been validated as biomarkers of AD. In contrast, there is no validated CSF biomarker for PD. We validated our proteomics-discovered multianalyte profile (MAP) in CSF from 95 control subjects, 48 patients with probable AD, and 40 patients with probable PD. An optimal 8-member MAP agreed with expert diagnosis for 90 control subjects (95%), 36 patients with probable AD (75%), and 38 patients with probable PD (95%). This MAP consisted of the following (in decreasing order of contribution): tau, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, interleukin 8, Abeta42, beta2-microglobulin, vitamin D binding protein, apolipoprotein (apo) AII, and apoE. This first large-scale validation of a proteomic-discovered MAP suggests a panel of 8 CSF proteins that are highly effective at identifying PD and moderately effective at identifying AD.
