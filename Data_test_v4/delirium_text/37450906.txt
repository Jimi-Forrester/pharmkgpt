37450906|t|Pro-Con Debate: Judicious Benzodiazepine Administration for Preoperative Anxiolysis in Older Patients.
37450906|a|In this Pro-Con commentary article, we discuss the risks and benefits of administering preoperative benzodiazepines to older patients to decrease preoperative anxiety. The Pro side first focuses on the critical importance of treating preoperative anxiety and that benzodiazepines are the best tool to achieve that goal. The competing argument presented by the Con side is that myriad options exist to treat preoperative anxiety without simultaneously increasing the risk for devastating complications such as postoperative delirium. Both sides call for more high-quality investigations to determine the most effective strategies for decreasing preoperative anxiety in older adults while improving outcomes and reducing morbidity.
