35558423|t|The Relationship Between 5-Hydroxytryptamine and Its Metabolite Changes With Post-stroke Depression.
35558423|a|Post-stroke depression (PSD) is the most common and serious sequelae of stroke. Approximately 33% of stroke survivors were affected by PSD. However, many issues (e.g., incidence, diagnostic marker, and risk factor) related to PSD remained unclear. The "monoamine hypothesis" is a significant hypothesis for depression, which suggests that three monoamines play a key role in depression. Therefore, most current antidepressants are developed to modulate the monoamines on PSD treatment, and these antidepressants have good effects on patients with PSD. However, the potential mechanisms of three monoamines in PSD are still unclear. Previously, we proposed "three primary emotions," which suggested a new model of basic emotions based on the three monoamines. It may provide a new way for PSD treatment. In addition, recent studies have found that monoamine-related emotional intervention also showed potential effects in the treatment and prevention of PSD. This study discusses these issues and attempts to provide a prospect for future research on PSD.
