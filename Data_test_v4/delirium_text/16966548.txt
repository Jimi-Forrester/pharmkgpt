16966548|a|OBJECTIVE: To assess the association of metabolic syndrome (MetS) with Alzheimer disease (AD). METHODS: The authors derived subjects from a population-based study of 980 randomly selected elderly subjects. After exclusion of all non-Alzheimer dementia cases, the final study population included 959 subjects (337 men and 622 women) aged 69 to 78 years. The presence of MetS was defined according to the National Cholesterol Education Program (Adult Treatment Panel III) criteria, and the diagnosis of AD was based on the criteria of the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke-Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association. RESULTS: Of the study subjects, 418 (43.6%) had MetS. Probable or possible AD was diagnosed in 45 subjects (4.7%). AD was more frequently detected in subjects with MetS than in subjects without MetS (7.2 vs 2.8%; p < 0.001). The prevalence of AD was higher in women with MetS vs women without the syndrome (8.3 vs 1.9%; p < 0.001), but in men with MetS, the prevalence of AD was not increased (3.8 vs 3.9%; p = 0.994). In univariate logistic regression analysis, MetS was significantly associated with AD (odds ratio [OR] 2.71; 95% CI 1.44 to 5.10). In multivariate logistic regression analysis including also apolipoprotein E4 phenotype, education, age, and total cholesterol, MetS was significantly associated with AD (OR 2.46; 95% CI 1.27 to 4.78). If only nondiabetic subjects were included in the multivariate analysis, MetS was still significantly associated with AD (OR 3.26; 95% CI 1.45 to 7.27). CONCLUSION: Metabolic syndrome is associated with Alzheimer disease in elderly subjects.
