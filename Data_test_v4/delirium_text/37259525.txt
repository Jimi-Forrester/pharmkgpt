37259525|t|The retina-brain axis and diabetic retinopathy.
37259525|a|Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a major contributor to permanent vision loss and blindness. Changes in retinal neurons, glia, and microvasculature have been the focus of intensive study in the quest to better understand DR. However, the impact of diabetes on the rest of the visual system has received less attention. There are reports of associations of changes in the visual system with preclinical and clinical manifestations of diabetes. Simultaneous investigation of the retina and the brain may shed light on the mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration in diabetics. Additionally, investigating the links between DR and other neurodegenerative disorders of the brain including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease may reveal shared mechanisms for neurodegeneration and potential therapy options.
