34634983|t|Actigraphy in mechanically ventilated pediatric ICU patients: comparison to PSG and evaluation of behavioral circadian rhythmicity.
34634983|a|Sleep disruption is common in pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) patients, but measuring sleep in this population is challenging. We aimed to evaluate the utility of actigraphy for estimating circadian rhythmicity in mechanically ventilated PICU patients and its accuracy for measuring sleep by comparing it to polysomnogram (PSG). We conducted a single-center prospective observational study of children 6 months - 17 years of age receiving mechanical ventilation and standard, protocolized sedation for acute respiratory failure, excluding children with acute or historical neurologic injury. We enrolled 16 children and monitored them with up to 14 days of actigraphy and 24 hours of simultaneous limited (10 channel) PSG. Daily actigraphy-based activity profiles demonstrated that patients had a high level of nighttime activity (30-41% of total activity), suggesting disrupted circadian activity cycles. Among n = 12 patients with sufficient actigraphy and PSG data overlap, actigraphy-based sleep estimation showed poor agreement with PSG-identified sleep states, with good sensitivity (94%) but poor specificity (28%), low accuracy (70%,) and low agreement (Cohen's kappa = 0.2, 95% CI = 0.08-0.31). Using univariate linear regression, we identified that Cornell Assessment of Pediatric Delirium scores were associated with accuracy of actigraphy but that other clinical factors including sedative medication doses, activity levels, and restraint use were not. In this population, actigraphy did not reliably discern between sleep and wake states. However, in select patients, actigraphy was able to distinguish diurnal variation in activity patterns, and therefore may be useful for evaluating patients' response to circadian-oriented interventions.
