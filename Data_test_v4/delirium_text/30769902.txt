30769902|t|Analysis of Topological Parameters of Complex Disease Genes Reveals the Importance of Location in a Biomolecular Network.
30769902|a|Network biology and medicine provide unprecedented opportunities and challenges for deciphering disease mechanisms from integrative viewpoints. The disease genes and their products perform their dysfunctions via physical and biochemical interactions in the form of a molecular network. The topological parameters of these disease genes in the interactome are of prominent interest to the understanding of their functionality from a systematic perspective. In this work, we provide a systems biology analysis of the topological features of complex disease genes in an integrated biomolecular network. Firstly, we identify the characteristics of four network parameters in the ten most frequently studied disease genes and identify several specific patterns of their topologies. Then, we confirm our findings in the other disease genes of three complex disorders (i.e., Alzheimer's disease, diabetes mellitus, and hepatocellular carcinoma). The results reveal that the disease genes tend to have a higher betweenness centrality, a smaller average shortest path length, and a smaller clustering coefficient when compared to normal genes, whereas they have no significant degree prominence. The features highlight the importance of gene location in the integrated functional linkages.
