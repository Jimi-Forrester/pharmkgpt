37620780|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The University of California, San Francisco Memory and Aging Center (UCSF-MAC) led the development and tested a collaborative care model delivered by lay care team navigators (CTNs) with support from a multidisciplinary team known as the Care Ecosystem (CE). We evaluated outcomes related to the feasibility of the CE in a non-academic healthcare system, including acceptability, adoption, and fidelity to the original UCSF model. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The CE team at HealthPartners consisted of two CTNs, a social worker, an RN, a program coordinator, and a behavioral neurologist. Intake forms were developed to collect demographic, baseline, and annual data at one year related to dementia severity and caregiver status. Experience surveys were completed at 6 and 12 months by participating caregivers. All data was entered into REDCap. RESULTS: A total of 570 PWD-caregiver dyads were recruited into the CE: 53% PWDs female, average age 75.2 +- 9.43, 19% living within rural communities. Of the 173 dyads assessed at one year, 30% responded to the annual intake forms and 58% of responded to experience surveys. At one year, PWDs progressed in disease severity and functional impairment, although caregiver burden and mood remained unchanged. We observed a significant reduction in caregiver reported emotional challenges associated with caregiving, sleep problems, and obtaining caregiver help at one year. 86% of caregivers reported feeling supported by their CTN nearly always or quite frequently, and 88% rated the CTN as highly responsive to what was important to them. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: The CE was feasible and well-received within a non-academic healthcare system.
