33222716|a|OBJECTIVES: Over 50% of inpatients with neurological disorders may present with a co-morbid psychiatric illness. Delirium has a reported point prevalence of 20% in hospital inpatients and is frequently undetected. We aimed to (1) examine inpatient referrals to a Liaison Neuropsychiatry service and (2) review the diagnosis and management of delirium before and after an educational intervention. METHODS: An initial 6-month audit of referrals to the inpatient Liaison Neuropsychiatry service was conducted in 2018. We then undertook a psychoeducational intervention to raise awareness of the diagnosis and management of delirium. We conducted a re-audit of referrals to the service in 2019. RESULTS: On initial audit, of 84 referrals, the most common referral was for mood (38%; n = 32). Just 4% (n = 3) had a specific delirium query. Following assessment by Neuropsychiatry, organic disorders (43%; n = 32), including delirium (33%; n = 25), were the most common diagnoses. On re-audit, of 86 referrals, mood assessment remained the most common reason for referral (38%; n = 33) and 2% (n = 2) were referred for possible delirium. Organic disorders remained the most common diagnoses (53%; n = 45) including delirium (38%; n = 32). We found a significant increase in the use of the delirium protocol from 12% (n = 3) on initial audit to 47% (n = 15); p < 0.01 on re-audit despite no increase in the number of specific delirium queries. CONCLUSIONS: A psychoeducational intervention improves the management of delirium by Neurologists and Neurosurgeons in patients with brain disorders.
