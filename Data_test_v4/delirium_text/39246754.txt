39246754|t|A complex case of recurrent intracranial bleeds due to malaria-induced coagulopathy: A case report and literature review.
39246754|a|Background: Malaria, a prevalent disease in the developing world, is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Infection with Plasmodium falciparum, although uncommon, can lead to severe brain injury, including intracranial hemorrhages, resulting in serious neurological deficits. Malaria-induced coagulopathy, while rarely reported, poses a challenge in understanding the exact mechanisms behind the development of intracranial bleeds. Proposed mechanisms include sequestration of parasitized erythrocytes in the brain's microvasculature, leading to capillary occlusion, endothelial damage, cytokine activation, and dysregulation of the coagulation cascade. Case Description: We present the case of a 53-year-old male rapidly deteriorating following a history of traumatic brain injury (TBI). Upon admission, a computed tomography scan revealed bilateral acute on chronic hematomas, necessitating a lifesaving craniotomy. Subsequently, the patient experienced three consecutive recurrent intracranial bleeds post-surgery, attributed to Falciparum-induced coagulopathy. Prompt recognition and intervention stabilized the patient's condition, leading to discharge on the 4th post-operative day. Conclusion: This case underscores the challenges posed by consecutive recurrent intracranial bleeds following TBI exacerbated by P. falciparum infection. It highlights the obstinate nature of malaria-induced coagulopathy and underscores the importance of timely and aggressive interventions in managing such cases.
