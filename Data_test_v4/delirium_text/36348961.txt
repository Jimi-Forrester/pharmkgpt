36348961|a|Background: The aim of this study was to measure serum brain injury biomarkers in patients with COVID-19 admitted to intensive care unit (ICU), without evidence of brain impairment, and to determine potential correlations with systemic inflammatory markers, illness severity, and outcome. Methods: In patients admitted to the ICU with COVID-19, without clinical evidence of brain injury, blood S100 calcium-binding protein B (S100B), neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were measured on admission. Clinical, routine laboratory data and illness severity were recorded. Comparisons between 28-day survivors and non-survivors and correlations of neurological biomarkers to other laboratory data and illness severity, were analyzed. Results: We included 50 patients, median age 64 [IQR 58-78] years, 39 (78%) males, 39 (78%) mechanically ventilated and 11 (22%) under high flow nasal oxygen treatment. S100B and NSE were increased in 19 (38%) and 45 (90%) patients, respectively. S100B was significantly elevated in non-survivors compared to survivors: 0.15 [0.10-0.29] versus 0.11 [0.07-0.17] mug/L, respectively, (p = 0.03), and significantly correlated with age, IL-6, arterial lactate, noradrenaline dose, illness severity and lymphocyte count. IL-6 was significantly correlated with C-reactive protein, noradrenaline dose and organ failure severity. NSE was correlated only with lactate dehydrogenase. Conclusion: Brain injury biomarkers were frequently elevated in COVID-19 ICU patients, in the absence of clinical evidence of brain injury. S100B was significantly correlated with IL-6, low lymphocyte count, hypoperfusion indices, illness severity, and short-term outcome. These findings indicate a possible brain astrocytes and neurons involvement, also suggesting a broader role of S100B in systemic inflammatory response.
