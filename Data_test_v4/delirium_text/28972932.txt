28972932|a|Interactions of Zn2+ with amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) and the subsequent induction of Abeta aggregation have been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The development of small-compound inhibitors against Zn2+-mediated Abeta aggregation is therefore greatly desired. In this study, brazilin was used to inhibit Zn2+-mediated Abeta aggregation and alleviate its cytotoxicity. The binding properties of brazilin and Zn2+ were first probed using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) assays. Both the FTIR and ITC results have shown that brazilin is able to bind Zn2+ in a physiologically suitable range of concentrations. The dissociation constant (Kd) between brazilin and Zn2+ was about 46.0+-6.8muM, which makes brazilin a potential drug model for the chelation of free Zn2+. Moreover, the higher affinity of brazilin for Abeta42 (Kd=2.5+-1.6muM) than that of Zn2+ (Kd=6.2+-0. 9muM), enables brazilin to sequester Zn2+ from the Abeta42-Zn2+ complex. In addition, the inhibitory effects of brazilin on Zn2+-mediated Abeta aggregation were examined using the Thioflavin T fluorescence assay, transmission electron microscopy and cytotoxicity assays. It was found that brazilin showed remarkable inhibitory capability against Zn2+-induced aggregation of Abeta42. Furthermore, the Zn2+-mediated cytotoxicity of Abeta42 was also largely mitigated under the influence of brazilin. This study therefore provides further insights into the role of Zn2+ in the Abeta42 aggregation pathway, indicating potential new strategies for the design of small compounds with therapeutic potential for AD.
