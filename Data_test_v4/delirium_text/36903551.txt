36903551|t|Neuroprotective Effects of Carnosic Acid: Insight into Its Mechanisms of Action.
36903551|a|Carnosic acid is a diterpenoid abundantly present in plants belonging to the genus Rosmarinus and Salvia of the family Lamiaceae, accounting for their application in traditional medicine. The diverse biological properties of carnosic acid that include antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticarcinogenic activities have instigated studies on its mechanistic role, providing further insights into its potential as a therapeutic agent. Accumulating evidence has established the relevance of carnosic acid as a neuroprotective agent exhibiting therapeutic efficacy in combatting neuronal-injury-induced disorders. The physiological importance of carnosic acid in the mitigation of neurodegenerative disorders is just beginning to be understood. This review summarizes the current data on the mode of action through which carnosic acid exerts its neuroprotective role that may serve to strategize novel therapeutic approaches for these debilitating neurodegenerative disorders.
