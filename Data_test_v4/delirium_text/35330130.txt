35330130|t|Physical Quality of Life of Sepsis Survivor Severely Malnourished Children after Hospital Discharge: Findings from a Retrospective Chart Analysis.
35330130|a|BACKGROUND: Quality of life (QoL) among pediatric sepsis survivors in resource-limited countries is poorly understood. We aimed to evaluate the QoL among sepsis survivors, by comparing them with non-sepsis survivors three months after hospital discharge. METHODOLOGY: In this retrospective chart analysis with a case-control design, we compared children having sepsis and non-sepsis at hospital admission and during their post-hospitalization life, where the study population was derived from a hospital cohort of 405 severely malnourished children having pneumonia. RESULTS: The median age (months, inter-quartile range) of the children having sepsis and non-sepsis was 10 (5, 17) and 9 (5, 18), respectively. Approximately half of the children among the sepsis survivors had new episodes of respiratory symptoms at home. Though death was significantly higher (15.8% vs. 2.7%, p <= 0.001) at admission among the sepsis group, deaths during post-hospitalization life (7.8% vs. 8.8%, p = 0.878) were comparable. A verbal autopsy revealed that before death, most of the children from the sepsis group had respiratory complaints, whereas gastrointestinal complaints were more common among the non-sepsis group. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric sepsis is life-threatening both during hospitalization and post-discharge. The QoL after sepsis is compromised, including re-hospitalization and the development of new episodes of respiratory symptoms especially before death.
