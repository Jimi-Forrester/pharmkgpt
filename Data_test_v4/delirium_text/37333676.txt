37333676|t|The 5XFAD mouse model of Alzheimer's disease displays age-dependent deficits in habituation to a novel environment.
37333676|a|Habituation is a form of learning characterized by a decrement in responsiveness to a stimulus that is repeated or prolonged. In rodents, habituation to a novel environment is characterized by a decrease in locomotion over time spent in a novel environment. Habituation to a novel environment is dependent on hippocampal function, suggesting that habituation behavior may be a relevant readout for hippocampal-dependent memory deficits that are characteristic of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Current assays that measure hippocampal-dependent memory in preclinical animal models of AD have not accurately predicted the cognitive protection of novel interventions in human trials. Here, we tested whether a behavioral habituation paradigm could detect age-associated changes in a common preclinical mouse model of AD-like amyloid pathology, the 5XFAD mouse. We exposed 5XFAD mice and age-matched wild-type (WT) littermates at 3, 6, and 9 months of age to a novel environment over two sessions separated by 24 h and measured their locomotion. WT mice habituated to the novel environment over time, while 5XFAD mice displayed age-dependent deficits in behavioral habituation. We replicated our results using publicly available open field data from 5XFAD and late-onset AD mouse models with TREM2*R47H and APOE4 mutations. Overall, we present behavioral habituation as a potentially sensitive task to assess age-associated behavioral deficits in 5XFAD mice and other mouse models of AD that could be used to test the preclinical efficacy of novel AD therapeutics.
