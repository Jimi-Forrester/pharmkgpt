22441986|t|Lipocalin 2: novel component of proinflammatory signaling in Alzheimer's disease.
22441986|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with an altered immune response, resulting in chronic increased inflammatory cytokine production with a prominent role of TNF-alpha. TNF-alpha signals are mediated by two receptors: TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) and TNF receptor 2 (TNFR2). Signaling through TNFR2 is associated with neuroprotection, whereas signaling through TNFR1 is generally proinflammatory and proapoptotic. Here, we have identified a TNF-alpha-induced proinflammatory agent, lipocalin 2 (Lcn2) via gene array in murine primary cortical neurons. Further investigation showed that Lcn2 protein production and secretion were activated solely upon TNFR1 stimulation when primary murine neurons, astrocytes, and microglia were treated with TNFR1 and TNFR2 agonistic antibodies. Lcn2 was found to be significantly decreased in CSF of human patients with mild cognitive impairment and AD and increased in brain regions associated with AD pathology in human postmortem brain tissue. Mechanistic studies in cultures of primary cortical neurons showed that Lcn2 sensitizes nerve cells to beta-amyloid toxicity. Moreover, Lcn2 silences a TNFR2-mediated protective neuronal signaling cascade in neurons, pivotal for TNF-alpha-mediated neuroprotection. The present study introduces Lcn2 as a molecular actor in neuroinflammation in early clinical stages of AD.
