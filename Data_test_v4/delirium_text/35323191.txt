35323191|t|Immune- and Non-Immune-Mediated Adverse Effects of Monoclonal Antibody Therapy: A Survey of 110 Approved Antibodies.
35323191|a|Identification of new disease-associated biomarkers; specific targeting of such markers by monoclonal antibodies (mAbs); and application of advances in recombinant technology, including the production of humanized and fully human antibodies, has enabled many improved treatment outcomes and successful new biological treatments of some diseases previously neglected or with poor prognoses. Of the 110 mAbs preparations currently approved by the FDA and/or EMA, 46 (including 13 antibody-drug conjugates) recognizing 29 different targets are indicated for the treatment of cancers, and 66, recognizing 48 different targets, are indicated for non-cancer disorders. Despite their specific targeting with the expected accompanying reduced collateral damage for normal healthy non-involved cells, mAbs, may cause types I (anaphylaxis, urticaria), II (e.g., hemolytic anemia, possibly early-onset neutropenia), III (serum sickness, pneumonitis), and IV (Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis) hypersensitivities as well as other cutaneous, pulmonary, cardiac, and liver adverse events. MAbs can provoke severe infusion reactions that resemble anaphylaxis and induce a number of systemic, potentially life-threatening syndromes with low frequency. A common feature of most of these syndromes is the release of a cascade of cytokines associated with inflammatory and immunological processes. Epidermal growth factor receptor-targeted antibodies may provoke papulopustular and mucocutaneous eruptions that are not immune-mediated.
