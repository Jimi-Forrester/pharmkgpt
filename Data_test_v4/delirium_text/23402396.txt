23402396|a|OBJECTIVES: This study examined the frequency and predictors of hospitalization and emergency room (ER) use among residents with Alzheimer's disease at admission and after 1 year in a long-term care facility. METHOD: This secondary analysis used data collected with the Chinese version of the Residential Assessment Instrument Minimum Data Set 2.0 during the Hong Kong Longitudinal Study on Long-Term Care Facility Residents. RESULTS: A sample of 169 residents with Alzheimer's disease who were newly admitted between 2005 and 2010 was included in the analysis. Mixed-effects modeling was adopted to assess the associations between risk factors and the frequency of hospitalization and ER use. At admission, 27 (15.98%) respondents had been hospitalized and 19 (11.24%) required ER services during the previous 90 days. At admission, polypharmacy (beta = .081, p < .01) and use of psychotropic drugs (beta = -.506, p < .05) were significantly associated with frequency of hospitalization. At 1-year follow-up, cognitive impairment (beta = .088, p < .05) and polypharmacy (beta = .058, p < .001) had significant positive associations with frequency of hospitalization, as well as use of ER services (beta = .084, p < .01; beta = .077, p < .001, respectively). Use of psychotropic drugs had a negative association with frequency of ER use at both time points. CONCLUSION: Practitioners should periodically observe cognitive ability, polypharmacy, and use of psychotropic drugs among long-term care residents with Alzheimer's disease.
