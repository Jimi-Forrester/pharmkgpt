35521065|a|Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common and debilitating gastrointestinal disorder that is exacerbated by stress and characterized by abdominal pain. Although microglia in the CNS have been implicated as an important mediator of the stress response, the role of microglia and microglia-GABAergic neuron interactions in the limbic area, most notably BNST, in the development of colorectal hypersensitivity has not been determined. We established a neonatal colorectal distension-induced chronic visceral hyperalgesia model in rats. The results showed that the frequency of spontaneous discharges of alBNST GABAergic neurons and the expression of GAD65/67 were significantly decreased in rats with chronic visceral pain. Moreover, ablation of BNST GABAergic neurons significantly reduced the visceral pain threshold in normal rats. Meanwhile, the number of M1 proinflammatory microglia and the expression of the M1 proinflammatory microglia-derived cytokines IL-6 and TNF-alpha were increased in the alBNST of rats with chronic visceral pain. Furthermore, alBNST infusion of the microglial inhibitor minocycline or IL-6 and TNF-alpha neutralizing antibodies significantly increased the visceral pain threshold. The decreased frequency of spontaneous discharges of alBNST GABAergic neurons in rats with chronic visceral pain was mimicked by a bath perfusion of TNF-alpha, but not IL-6, and was abolished by a perfusion of the microglial inhibitor minocycline. In addition, the alBNST infusion of the microglial inhibitor minocycline upregulated the expression of GAD65/67. Moreover, ablation of BNST GABAergic neurons significantly decreased the visceral pain threshold in normal rats, which was not reversed by a subsequent infusion of the microglial inhibitor minocycline. Our findings revealed this microglia-GABAergic neuron circuit in the alBNST, and this microglia-driven disinhibitory mechanism is essential for brain and gut dysfunction in stressful condition, providing a novel potential target for treating patients with IBS presenting visceral pain that is worsened during episodes of stress.
