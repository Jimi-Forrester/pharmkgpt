36615197|a|Functional foods include enhanced, enriched, fortified, or whole foods that impart health benefits beyond their nutritional value, particularly when consumed as part of a varied diet on a regular basis at effective levels. Marine sources can serve as the sources of various healthy foods and numerous functional food ingredients with biological effects can be derived from these sources. Microalgae, macroalgae, crustaceans, fungi, bacteria fish, and fish by-products are the most common marine sources that can provide many potential functional food ingredients including phenolic compounds, proteins and peptides, and polysaccharides. Neuroinflammation is closely linked with the initiation and progression of various neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, and Parkinson's disease. Activation of astrocytes and microglia is a defense mechanism of the brain to counter damaged tissues and detrimental pathogens, wherein their chronic activation triggers neuroinflammation that can further exacerbate or induce neurodegeneration. Currently, available therapeutic agents only provide symptomatic relief from these disorders and no therapies are available to stop or slow down the advancement of neurodegeneration. Thereffore, natural compounds that can exert a protective effect against these disorders have therapeutic potential. Numerous chemical compounds, including bioactive peptides, fatty acids, pigments, alkaloids, and polysaccharides, have already been isolated from marine sources that show anti-inflammatory properties, which can be effective in the treatment and prevention of neuroinflammatory disorders. The anti-inflammatory potential of marine-derived compounds as functional food ingredients in the prevention and treatment of neurological disorders is covered in this review.
