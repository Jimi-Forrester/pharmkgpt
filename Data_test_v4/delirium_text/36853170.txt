36853170|a|The development of neurological pathologies is linked to the accumulation of protein aggregates like alpha-synuclein in Parkinson's disease and tau protein in Alzheimer's disease. Mono- or di-ubiquitination of these molecules has been reported to stabilize aggregates and contribute to the disorders. STIP1 Homologous and U-Box-containing protein 1 (STUB1) is a multifunctional protein that maintains proteostasis and insulin signalling. In spinocerebellar ataxia 16 (SCAR16), an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disease, mutations in and aggregation of STUB1 are reported. Despite the well-accepted neuroprotective role of STUB1, very little is known of regulatory mechanisms that control the dynamics of STUB1 aggregate assembly. Here, we report that CARP2, a ubiquitin ligase, is a novel regulator of STUB1. CARP2 interacts and mono-ubiquitinates STUB1. Furthermore, we found that CARP2 regulates STUB1 through its TPR motif, a domain that is also associated with HSP70. Modification of STUB1 by CARP2 leads to detergent-insoluble aggregate formation. Importantly, pathogenic mutants of STUB1 are more prone than the wild-type to CARP2-mediated aggregate assembly. Hence our findings revealed CARPs (CARP1 & CARP2) as novel regulators of STUB1 and controlled its cytosolic versus aggregate dynamics.
