36446812|t|Handgrip strength effectiveness and optimal measurement timing for predicting functional outcomes of a geriatric hip fracture.
36446812|a|Handgrip strength (HGS) now draws attention as one of the predictors of outcomes following geriatric hip fracture; however, its effectiveness and the optimal time to assess HGS remain unknown. Herein, we aimed to determine the usefulness of HGS in predicting the outcomes of geriatric hip fracture and to find the most effective time to measure HGS in both the low muscle strength and normal hip fracture groups. The study was performed prospectively for 79 geriatric hip fracture patients. HGS was measured during the admission period and the one-week postoperative period. Walking ability and quality of life were assessed using Koval scores and the European Quality of Life Five Dimension (EQ-5D) scale at the admission period and postoperatively at 3, 6, and 12 months, respectively. The relationship between pre/postoperative HGS and functional outcomes was assessed, and the functional score between the "low muscle strength" and "normal muscle strength" groups was compared. The association between HGS asymmetry and low strength with functional limitations was determined. For the preoperative HGS, the Koval score showed a significant relationship in the postoperative 6-month (r = -0.295, P = 0.008) and 12-month (r = -0.266, P = 0.019) periods; also, the EQ-5D score showed a significant relationship in the postoperative 6-month and 12-month periods (r = 0.344, P < 0.001, and r = 0.386, P = 0.001, respectively). For the postoperative HGS, the Koval score showed a significant relationship in the 6-month (r = -0.432, P < 0.001) and 12-month (r = -0.344, P = 0.002) postoperative periods. Also, the EQ-5D score showed a significant relationship in the 3-month (r = 0.340, P = 0.010), 6-month (r = 0.476, P < 0.001), and 12-month (r = 0.471, P < 0.001) postoperative periods. The incidence of preoperative and postoperative low HGS was 78.5% and 70.9%, respectively. The "low-strength" group had poor Koval scores and EQ-5D at postoperative month 12 and poor functional outcomes earlier in the follow-up (postoperative 6- and 12-month Koval scores and postoperative 3-, 6-, and 12-month EQ-5D), respectively (P = 0.008 and P = 0.003; P = 0.003, P = 0.001, and P = 0.001). The effect of HGS asymmetry and low strength on functional limitations remained undetermined. Both preoperative and postoperative HGS reflected functional outcomes of patients with hip fracture during the 12-month follow-up. Postoperative HGS had a higher prognostic value than preoperative HGS.
