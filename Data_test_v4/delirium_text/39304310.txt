39304310|t|Antipsychotic management in general practice: serial cross-sectional study (2011-2020).
39304310|a|BACKGROUND: Long-term use of antipsychotics confers increased risk of cardiometabolic disease. Ongoing need should be reviewed regularly by psychiatrists. AIM: To explore trends in antipsychotic management in general practice, and proportions of patients prescribed antipsychotics receiving psychiatrist review. DESIGN AND SETTING: A serial cross-sectional study using linked general practice and hospital data in Wales (2011-2020). METHOD: Participants were adults (>=18 years) registered with general practices in Wales. Outcome measures were prevalence of patients receiving >=6 antipsychotic prescriptions annually, proportion of patients prescribed antipsychotics receiving annual psychiatrist review, and proportion of patients prescribed antipsychotics registered on UK Serious Mental Illness, Depression and/or Dementia registers, or not on any of these registers. RESULTS: Prevalence of adults prescribed long-term antipsychotics increased from 1.06% (95%CI 1.04 to 1.07%) in 2011 to 1.45% (95%CI 1.43 to 1.46%) in 2020. The proportion receiving annual psychiatrist review decreased from 59.6% (95%CI 58.9 to 60.4%) in 2011 to 52.0% (95C%CI 51.4 to 52.7%) in 2020. The proportion of antipsychotics prescribed to patients not on the Serious Mental Illness register increased from 50% (95%CI 49 to 51%) in 2011 to 56% (95%CI 56 to 57%) by 2020. CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of long-term antipsychotic use is increasing. More patients are managed by general practitioners without psychiatrist review and are not on monitored disease registers; they thus may be less likely to undergo cardiometabolic monitoring and miss opportunities to optimise or deprescribe antipsychotics. These trends pose risks for patients and need to be addressed urgently.
