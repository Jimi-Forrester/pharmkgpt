32820313|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is currently the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease in the aging population. It is characterized by massive deposition of extracellular beta-amyloid peptide and formation of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles. Cancer is also an age-related disease. Some epidemiological studies have shown an inverse relationship between AD and the onset of various types of cancers, that is, the risk of cancer in patients with AD is reduced, and vice versa. Epigenetic mechanisms play important roles in the development of AD and cancer. In this article, we will review the recent research advances on the epigenetic mechanisms of AD and cancer onset, and provide new ideas for rethinking the relevance of AD and cancer with a "holistic concept".
