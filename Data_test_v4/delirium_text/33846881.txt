33846881|a|The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared that neurodegenerative diseases will be the biggest health issues of the twenty-first century. Among these, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases can be considered as the most acute incurable neurological diseases. Researchers are studying and developing a new treatment approach that uses nanotechnology to diagnosis and treatment neurodegenerative diseases. This treatment strategy will be used to regress neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common forms of reduced brain function, which causes many devastating complications. Current neurodegenerative diseases treatment protocols only help to treat symptoms nevertheless with nanotechnology approaches, can regress nerve cells apoptosis, reduce inflammation, and improve brain drug delivery. In this paper, new nanotechnology methods such as nanobodies, nano-antibodies, and lipid nanoparticles have been investigated. Correspondingly blood-brain barrier drug delivery improvement methods have been suggested.
