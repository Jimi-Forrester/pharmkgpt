32425790|a|Gut microbiome maintains local gut integrity and systemic host homeostasis, where optimal control of intestinal lipopolysaccharides (LPS) activity may play an important role. LPS mainly produced from gut microbiota are a group of lipid-polysaccharide chemical complexes existing in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. Traditionally, LPS mostly produced from Proteobacteria are well known for their ability in inducing strong inflammatory responses (proinflammatory LPS, abbreviated as P-LPS), leading to septic shock or even death in animals and humans. Although the basic structures and chemical properties of P-LPS derived from different bacterial species generally show similarity, subtle and differential immune activation activities are observed. On the other hand, frequently ignored, a group of LPS molecules mainly produced by certain microbiota bacteria such as Bacteroidetes show blunt or even antagonistic activity in initiating pro-inflammatory responses (anti-inflammatory LPS, abbreviated as A-LPS). In this review, besides the immune activation properties of P-LPS, we also focus on the description of anti-inflammatory effects of A-LPS, and their potential antagonistic mechanism. We address the possibility of using native or engineered A-LPS for immune modulation in prevention or even treatment of P-LPS induced chronic inflammation related diseases. Understanding the exquisite interactive relationship between structure-activity correlation of P- and A-LPS not only contributes to molecular understanding of immunomodulation and homeostasis, but also re-animates the development of novel LPS-based pharmacological strategy for prevention and therapy of chronic inflammation related diseases.
