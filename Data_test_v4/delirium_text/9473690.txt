9473690|t|Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF/SF) in Alzheimer's disease.
9473690|a|Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF/SF), is a heparin-binding polypeptide which stimulates DNA synthesis in a variety of cell types and also promotes cell migration and morphogenesis. HGF/SF mRNA has been found in a variety of tissues, including brain. In a previous study, we showed that basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), another heparin-binding protein is increased in Alzheimer's disease (AD), and appears to be associated with the heparan-sulfate proteoglycans bound to B/A4 amyloid (Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 171 (1990) 690-696). In the present study, we examined the distribution of HGF/SF in 4% paraformaldehyde fixed samples of prefrontal cortex from control and Alzheimer patients, in order to assess the possibility that HGF/SF may be found in association with the pathologic changes which occur in Alzheimer's disease. A specific polyclonal antibody directed against HGF/SF revealed widespread HGF/SF-like immunoreactivity in both the cerebral cortex and white matter. Confocal microscopy confirmed that HGF/SF could be found in both GFAP positive astrocytes and LN3 positive microglia cells, as well as rare scattered cortical neurons. In the AD cases studied, the immunoreactivity was increased within both the astrocytes and microglial cells surrounding individual senile plaques. No staining was seen within the neurofibrillary tangles. Western blot analysis confirmed the normal molecular form of HGF/SF in Alzheimer's disease. Quantitative ELISA assay demonstrated a significant increase in HGF/SF in AD relative to age matched controls. These studies confirm the presence of HGF/SF immunoreactivity within neurons, astrocytes and microglial cells. They also indicate that HGF/SF may be increased within senile plaques as a function of the gliosis and microglial proliferation which occurs in association with these structures in Alzheimer's disease.
