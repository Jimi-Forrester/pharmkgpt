27981184|t|Pioglitazone, a PPARgamma agonist rescues depression associated with obesity using chronic unpredictable mild stress model in experimental mice.
27981184|a|Pioglitazone, a peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) agonist belonging to thiazolidinedione class, is mainly used in diabetes mellitus. Obese subjects are twice likely to become depressed than non-obese individuals. The biological mechanisms linking depression with obesity still remain poorly understood and there is immense need for better therapeutic intervention against such co-morbid disorders. The present study investigates the effect of pioglitazone on the chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) induced depression in obese mice by using behavioral tests and biochemical estimations. Mice were fed with high fat diet (HFD) for 14 weeks and were further subjected to different stress procedures for 28 days to induce depressive behavior. Animals were administered orally with pioglitazone (30 mg/kg p.o.)/escitalopram (10 mg/kg p.o.)/vehicle (10 ml/kg p.o.) daily from day 15-28. Various behavioral paradigms such as sucrose preference test, forced swim test (FST), tail suspension test (TST) and elevated plus maze (EPM) were performed. Biochemical estimations including plasma glucose, total cholesterol, triglycerides, and total proteins were performed. The data obtained from behavioral assays and biochemical assessments indicated that obese animals exhibited severe depressive-like behavior compared to non-obese animals. Furthermore, obese animals subjected to CUMS worsen the depressive behavior compared to obese control animals. Repetitive treatment with pioglitazone reversed the CUMS induced behavioral and biochemical alterations in HFD fed obese mice which atleast in part may be mediated through improving altered plasma glucose. The study suggests that pioglitazone needs further attention with respect to molecular mechanisms that could provide a better therapeutic strategy against depression associated with obesity.
