32531260|t|Nerve growth factor in metabolic complications and Alzheimer's disease: Physiology and therapeutic potential.
32531260|a|As the population ages, obesity and metabolic complications as well as neurological disorders are becoming more prevalent, with huge economic burdens on both societies and families. New therapeutics are urgently needed. Nerve growth factor (NGF), first discovered in 1950s, is a neurotrophic factor involved in regulating cell proliferation, growth, survival, and apoptosis in both central and peripheral nervous systems. NGF and its precursor, proNGF, bind to TrkA and p75 receptors and initiate protein phosphorylation cascades, resulting in changes of cellular functions, and are associated with obesity, diabetes and its complications, and Alzheimer's disease. In this article, we summarize changes in NGF levels in metabolic and neuronal disorders, the signal transduction initiated by NGF and proNGF, the physiological and pathophysiological relevance, and therapeutic potential in treating chronic metabolic diseases and cognitive decline.
