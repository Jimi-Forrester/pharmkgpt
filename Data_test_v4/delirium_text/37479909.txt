37479909|a|OBJECTIVE: To explore the correlation between intraoperative burst suppression (BS) and postoperative delirium (POD) in elderly patients, and provide more ideas for reducing POD in clinical. METHODS: Ninety patients, aged over 60 years, who underwent lumbar internal fixation surgery in our hospital were selected. General information of patients was obtained and informed consent was signed during preoperative visits. Patients were divided into burst suppression (BS) group and non-burst suppression (NBS) group by intraoperative electroencephalogram monitoring. Intraoperative systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and heart rate (HR) were recorded, and the variation and minimum value were obtained by calculating. Hemoglobin (HGB), C-reactive protein (CRP), system immune inflammatory index (SII) at 24 and 72 h after surgery, the incidence of postoperative adverse reactions, postoperative hospital stay, and total cost were recorded after operation. POD assessment was performed using CAM within 7 days after surgery or until discharge. SPSS25.0 was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Compared with the NBS group, the number of elderly patients with high frailty level in BS group was more (P = 0.048). There is correlation between BS and POD (OR: 4.954, 95%CI 1.034-23.736, P = 0.045), and most of the POD patients in BS group behave as hyperactive type. CONCLUSION: The occurrence of intraoperative BS is associated with POD, and elderly patients with frailty are more likely to have intraoperative BS. BS can be used as a predictor of POD.
