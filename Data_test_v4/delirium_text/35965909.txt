35965909|t|Dermatologic and Cosmetic Procedures in Pregnancy.
35965909|a|Background: Patients may develop a need to undergo procedures while being pregnant and this requires a certain risk-benefit profiling to be done by the clinician. Skin changes during pregnancy such as melasma, striae, varicose veins, hirsutism, and increased skin growths may raise concerns for the lady. Although pregnancy-induced physiologic changes may prompt a surgeon to delay nonessential procedures until after delivery, certain skin conditions may require urgent intervention. Others that may be nonurgent, elective, or cosmetic may need careful analysis. Materials and Methods: Data were extracted from available literature through a PubMed search for the following keywords: "dermatological procedures in pregnancy," "dermatosurgical procedures during pregnancy," "aesthetic procedures in pregnancy," "safety in pregnancy," "teratogenicity of drugs," "local anesthesia during pregnancy," "physiological changes in pregnancy," "cosmetic procedures during pregnancy," and "lasers in pregnancy." Results: Only procedures which are safe and necessary should be carried out in a pregnant woman. Electrocautery, radiofrequency, cryotherapy, and lasers for warts, particularly genital, surgical interventions for skin malignancies, and other small growths should be performed. Safe but cautious outlook is required for intralesional steroid injections, aesthetic procedures such as chemical peeling, botulinum toxin, microdermabrasion, and biopsies for questionable lesions. Absolutely contraindicated procedures include fillers, sclerotherapy, and liposuction.
