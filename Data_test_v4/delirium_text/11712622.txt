11712622|a|We measured and compared levels of plasma free 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenyl (ethylene)glycol (pMHPG), a major metabolite of noradrenaline, and natural killer (NK) cell activity in 26 patients prior to their undergoing an operation for cardiovascular diseases; 11 of whom expressed delirium and 15 who did not. In conclusion, we found that pMHPG levels before an operation were higher in patients with postoperative delirium than in the patients without, while NK cell activity showed no difference between the two groups. It is possible that hyperactivity of noradrenargic neurons is connected with the development of postoperative delirium. Furthermore, we considered that measurement of pMHPG level before operation might be a useful tool to predict the occurrence of postoperative delirium.
