39340928|t|SERCA pump as a novel therapeutic target for treating neurodegenerative disorders.
39340928|a|The neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Huntington's disease (HD) and Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs), present an enormous medical, social, financial and scientific problem. Despite intense research into the causes of these disorders, only marginal progress has been made in the clinic and no cures exist for any of them. Most of the scientific effort has been focused on identification of the major causes of these diseases and on developing ways to target them, such as targeting amyloid accumulation for AD or targeting expression of mutant Huntingtin for HD. Calcium (Ca2+) signaling has long been proposed to play an important role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders, but blockers of Ca2+ channels and Ca2+ signaling proteins have not been translated to clinic primarily due to side effects related to the important roles of target molecules for these compounds at the peripheral tissues. In this review article, we would like to discuss an idea that recently identified positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) of the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum calcium (SERCA) pump may provide a promising approach to develop therapeutic compounds for treatment of these disorders. This hypothesis is supported by the preclinical data obtained with animal models of AD and PD. The first critical test of this idea will be an imminent phase I study that will offer an opportunity to evaluate potential side effects of this class of compounds in humans.
