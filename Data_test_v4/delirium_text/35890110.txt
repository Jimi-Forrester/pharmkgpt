35890110|t|The Role of Non-Coding RNAs in the Pathogenesis of Parkinson's Disease: Recent Advancement.
35890110|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative aging disorder that manifests as motor and non-motor symptoms, and its etiopathogenesis is influenced by non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). Signal pathway and gene sequence studies have proposed that alteration of ncRNAs is relevant to the occurrence and development of PD. Furthermore, many studies on brain tissues and body fluids from patients with PD indicate that variations in ncRNAs and their target genes could trigger or exacerbate neurodegenerative pathogenesis and serve as potential non-invasive biomarkers of PD. Numerous ncRNAs have been considered regulators of apoptosis, alpha-syn misfolding and aggregation, mitochondrial dysfunction, autophagy, and neuroinflammation in PD etiology, and evidence is mounting for the determination of the role of competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) mechanisms in disease development. In this review, we discuss the current knowledge regarding the regulation and function of ncRNAs as well as ceRNA networks in PD pathogenesis, focusing on microRNAs, long ncRNAs, and circular RNAs to increase the understanding of the disease and propose potential target identification and treatment in the early stages of PD.
