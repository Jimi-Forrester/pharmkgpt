23800542|a|To develop a safe and efficient Abeta vaccine for Alzheimer's disease, we constructed a plasmid DNA vaccine encoding ten repeats of Abeta3-10 and three copies of C3d-p28 as a molecular adjuvant and administered it intramuscularly in 12-month-old female Tg-APPswe/PSEN1dE9 mice. Therapeutic immunization with p(Abeta3-10)10-C3d-p28.3 stimulated a Th2 immune response that elicited therapeutic levels of anti-Abeta antibodies and improved cognitive function. In addition, the vaccine reduced the cerebral Abeta burden and astrocytosis without increasing the incidence of microhemorrhage. Our results indicate that the p(Abeta3-10)10-C3d-p28.3 vaccine is a promising immunotherapeutic option for Abeta vaccination in Alzheimer's disease.
