38278659|t|Disentangling tau: One protein, many therapeutic approaches.
38278659|a|The tauopathies encompass over 20 adult neurodegenerative diseases and are characterized by the dysfunction and accumulation of insoluble tau protein. Among them, Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, and progressive supranuclear palsy collectively impact millions of patients and their families worldwide. Despite years of drug development using a variety of mechanisms of action, no therapeutic directed against tau has been approved for clinical use. This raises important questions about our current model of tau pathology and invites thoughtful consideration of our approach to nonclinical models and clinical trial design. In this article, we review what is known about the biology and genetics of tau, placing it in the context of current and failed clinical trials. We highlight potential reasons for the lack of success to date and offer suggestions for new pathways in therapeutic development. Overall, our viewpoint to the future is optimistic for this important group of neurodegenerative diseases.
