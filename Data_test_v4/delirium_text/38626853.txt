38626853|a|BACKGROUND: The neuronal and gliaI populations within the brain are tightly interwoven, making isolation and study of large populations of a single cell type from brain tissue a major technical challenge. Concurrently, cell-type specific extracellular vesicles (EVs) hold enormous diagnostic and therapeutic potential in neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD). NEW METHOD: Postmortem AD cortical samples were thawed and gently dissociated. Following filtration, myelin and red blood cell removal, cell pellets were immunolabeled with fluorescent antibodies and analyzed by flow cytometry. The cell pellet supernatant was applied to a triple sucrose cushion for brain EV isolation. RESULTS: Neuronal, astrocyte and microglial cell populations were identified. Cell integrity was demonstrated using calcein AM, which is retained by cells with esterase activity and an intact membrane. For some experiments cell pellets were fixed, permeabilized, and immunolabeled for cell-specific markers. Characterization of brain small EV fractions showed the expected size, depletion of EV negative markers, and enrichment in positive and cell-type specific markers. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS AND CONCLUSIONS: We optimized and integrated established protocols, aiming to maximize information obtained from each human autopsy brain sample. The uniqueness of our method lies in its capability to isolate cells and EVs from a single cryopreserved brain sample. Our results not only demonstrate the feasibility of isolating specific brain cell subpopulations for RNA-seq but also validate these subpopulations at the protein level. The accelerated study of EVs from human samples is crucial for a better understanding of their contribution to neuron/glial crosstalk and disease progression.
