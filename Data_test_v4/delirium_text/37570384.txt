37570384|t|How the Mind Creates the Body and What Can Go Wrong: Case Studies of Misperceptions of the Body.
37570384|a|The review brings together a wealth of case studies, both from the authors' patients and from the literature, about people whose bodies do not feel as they really should. Body parts suddenly become longer or shorter, heavier or lighter and there may be a loss of body control to the point where individuals feel as if they no longer have a body at all. The article differentiates by type of causes: mental disorders (e.g., psychosis), the influence of drugs on body perception and neurological causes. Depending on the type of body change, examples are given from the categories of sexually toned changes in body perception, out-of-body experiences and near-death experiences. Since there are countless types of body image disorders, the article is limited to a selective selection of the most interesting and sometimes obscure deviations.
