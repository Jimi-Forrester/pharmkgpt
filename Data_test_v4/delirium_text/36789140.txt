36789140|t|Neurological Complications and Potential Effects of Covid-19: Symptoms and Conceivable Mechanisms.
36789140|a|A novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. The new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) in March 2020. SARS-CoV-2 can invade the nervous system aside from infecting the respiratory system as its primary target. The most common nervous system symptoms of COVID-19 are stated as headache, myalgia, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, sudden and unexplained anosmia, and ageusia. More severe conditions such as encephalomyelitis, acute myelitis, thromboembolic events, ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, Guillain-Barre-syndrome, Bell's palsy, rhabdomyolysis, and even coma have also been reported. Cohort studies revealed that neurological findings are associated with higher morbidity and mortality. The neurological symptoms and manifestations caused by SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 are examined and summarized in this article.
