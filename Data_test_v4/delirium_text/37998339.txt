37998339|t|ALKBH5 Stabilized N6-Methyladenosine-Modified LOC4191 to Suppress E. coli-Induced Apoptosis.
37998339|a|E. coli is a ubiquitous pathogen that is responsible for over one million fatalities worldwide on an annual basis. In animals, E. coli can cause a variety of diseases, including mastitis in dairy cattle, which represents a potential public health hazard. However, the pathophysiology of E. coli remains unclear. We found that E. coli could induce global upregulation of m6A methylation and cause serious apoptosis in bovine mammary epithelial cells (MAC-T cells). Furthermore, numerous m6A-modified lncRNAs were identified through MeRIP-seq. Interestingly, we found that the expression of LOC4191 with hypomethylation increased in MAC-T cells upon E. coli-induced apoptosis. Knocking down LOC4191 promoted E. coli-induced apoptosis and ROS levels through the caspase 3-PARP pathway. Meanwhile, knocking down ALKBH5 resulted in the promotion of apoptosis through upregulated ROS and arrested the cell cycle in MAC-T cells. ALKBH5 silencing accelerated LOC4191 decay by upregulating its m6A modification level, and the process was recognized by hnRNP A1. Therefore, this indicates that ALKBH5 stabilizes m6A-modified LOC4191 to suppress E. coli-induced apoptosis. This report discusses an initial investigation into the mechanism of m6A-modified lncRNA in cells under E. coli-induced apoptosis and provides novel insights into infectious diseases.
