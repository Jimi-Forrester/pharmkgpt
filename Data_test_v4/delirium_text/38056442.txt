38056442|t|EEG-Messung in Narkose.
38056442|a|Based on the existing literature, the application of designated, processed EEG-monitors to measure anesthetic depth and the associated clinical implications are explained. EEG-monitors quantify the hypnotic portion of anesthesia, but not the nociceptive properties of anesthetics. Depth of anesthesia monitoring is common practice in many German hospitals and helps to visualize the interindividual variability of anesthetics, especially of propofol. Although deep anesthesia is associated with increased long-term mortality, this relation seems not to be causally related. Nevertheless, depth of anesthesia monitors help to identify patients being especially susceptible to anesthetics. Moreover, they have shown to reduce the incidence of intraoperative awareness and postoperative delirium. The application of processed EEG-monitors to reduce the incidence of postoperative delirium is currently recommended by the European Society of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care.
