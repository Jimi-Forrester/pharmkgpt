35721948|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a very complicated and multifactorial neurological disorder having limited therapeutic interventions illustrated by the impairment in memory and cognitive function. Several lines of confirmation are stoutly connected with mitochondrial function perturbation as a significant causative factor in AD, while the molecular mechanisms involved in AD pathogenesis are still poorly understood. Minocycline, a well-known antibiotic, has confirmed efficacy against mitochondrial defects and oxidative stress as a neuroprotective effect. In view of this property, we examined the remedial effect of minocycline on AD. To attain insight into the molecular machinery responsible for AD pathogenesis, we preferred the UAS/GAL4 scheme for the development of AD in flies that overexpress the Abeta42 protein in the brain of Drosophila. The warning signs like the declined lifespan, locomotion deficit and memory loss, impaired mitochondrial membrane potential, and increased caspase 3 expression with mitogen-associated protein kinases linked with AD pathogenesis were examined in the existence of minocycline. Minocycline halted the Abeta42-induced symptoms including behavioral changes and altered the mitochondrial membrane potential along with apoptotic factors' protein expression (JNK/p-JNK and caspase 3). Thus, the current study could be functional to find out the role of minocycline in human Abeta42-overexpressed transgenic AD flies.
