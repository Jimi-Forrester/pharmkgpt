29067349|t|Serum concentrations of vitamin E and carotenoids are altered in Alzheimer's disease: A case-control study.
29067349|a|INTRODUCTION: Oxidative stress has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We investigated associations between serum levels of lipophilic antioxidants and AD. METHODS: Serum concentrations of retinol, two forms of vitamin E (alpha- and gamma-tocopherol) and six carotenoids were quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography from patients with AD (n = 251) and cognitively intact controls (n = 308) and assessed by regression analyses. RESULTS: Serum levels of alpha-tocopherol and all six carotenoids were significantly lower in patients with AD compared with cognitively intact controls (P < .001). In contrast, gamma-tocopherol was significantly higher in the serum of patients with AD (odds ratio = 1.17 [confidence intervals: 1.05-1.31]). DISCUSSION: Our findings implicate compromised serum antioxidant defenses in AD pathogenesis and differing biological roles for vitamin E isoforms. This highlights the need for improved understanding in the balanced upregulation of exogenous antioxidants related to dietary intake or supplement use in future nutritional intervention studies.
