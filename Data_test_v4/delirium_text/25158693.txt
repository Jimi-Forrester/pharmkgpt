Alongside the recent description of the impairment of lysosomal acidification, we wanted to study the relationships between inflammation and autophagy, two physiological components deregulated in AD. Therefore, a longitudinal study was performed in APPswePS1dE9 transgenic mice at three, six and twelve months of age. METHODS: Autophagic markers (Beclin-1, p62 and LC3) and the activation of mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway were quantified by western blot. Cytokine levels (IL-1beta, TNF-alpha and IL-6) were measured by ELISA. Transmission electron microscopy was performed to detect autophagic vacuoles. Mann-Whitney tests were used to compare wild-type (WT) versus APPswePS1dE9 mice. Longitudinal changes in parameters were analyzed with a Kruskal-Wallis test followed by a post-hoc Dunn's test. Correlation between two parameters was assessed using a Spearman test. RESULTS: Compared to 12-month old WT mice, 12-month old APPswePS1dE9 mice had higher levels of IL-1beta and TNF-alpha, a greater inhibition of the mTOR signaling pathway and lower levels of Beclin-1 expression both in cortex and hippocampus. Regarding the relationship of the various parameters in 12-month old APPswePS1dE9 mice, Beclin-1 rates were positively correlated with IL-1beta and TNF-alpha levels. And, on the contrary, TNF-alpha levels were inversely correlated with the levels of mTOR activation. Altogether, these results suggest that inflammation could induce autophagy in APPswePS1dE9 mice. However, these transgenic mice displayed a large accumulation of autophagic vesicles within dystrophic neurons in cortex and hippocampus, indicating a terminal failure in the autophagic process. CONCLUSIONS: This first demonstration of relationships between inflammation and autophagy in in vivo models of AD should be taken into account in new therapeutic strategies to prevent inflammation and/or stimulate autophagy in advanced neurodegenerative process such as AD.
