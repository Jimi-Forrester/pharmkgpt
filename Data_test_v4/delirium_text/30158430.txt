30158430|a|The mammalian HSP90 family of proteins is a cluster of highly conserved molecules that are involved in myriad cellular processes. Their distribution in various cellular compartments underlines their essential roles in cellular homeostasis. HSP90 and its co-chaperones orchestrate crucial physiological processes such as cell survival, cell cycle control, hormone signaling, and apoptosis. Conversely, HSP90, and its secreted forms, contribute to the development and progress of serious pathologies, including cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, targeting HSP90 is an attractive strategy for the treatment of neoplasms and other diseases. This manuscript will review the general structure, regulation and function of HSP90 family and their potential role in pathophysiology.
