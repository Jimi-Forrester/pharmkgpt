32731413|t|MicroRNAs and Apoptosis in Colorectal Cancer.
32731413|a|Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third leading cause of cancer death in the world, and its incidence is rising in developing countries. Treatment with 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is known to improve survival in CRC patients. Most anti-cancer therapies trigger apoptosis induction to eliminate malignant cells. However, de-regulated apoptotic signaling allows cancer cells to escape this signaling, leading to therapeutic resistance. Treatment resistance is a major challenge in the development of effective therapies. The microRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in CRC treatment resistance and CRC progression and apoptosis. This review discusses the role of miRNAs in contributing to the promotion or inhibition of apoptosis in CRC and the role of miRNAs in modulating treatment resistance in CRC cells.
