26402754|t|Statin Use is Associated with Better Cognitive Function in Elderly with Type 2 Diabetes.
26402754|a|The pleiotropic contribution of statins on cognition is uncertain. From 840 patients in the cohort from the Israel Diabetes and Cognitive Decline Study, we identified 61 non-statin users and compared them with 45 patients who had used statins at least 90% of the time. Analysis of covariance was performed to compare mean cognitive z-scores between statin users and non-users while adjusting for socio-demographic, diabetes-related, and cardiovascular covariates which included change in cholesterol by year. Overall cognition, memory, and executive function was found to be significantly better in statin users (p <  0.0008). This suggests a positive effect of statins on cognitive function of type 2 diabetes patients that is independent of cholesterol levels.
