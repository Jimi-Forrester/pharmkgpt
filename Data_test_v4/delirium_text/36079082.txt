36079082|a|Patients with "post-COVID" syndrome manifest with a variety of signs and symptoms that continue/develop after acute COVID-19. Among the most common are gastrointestinal (GI) and mental symptoms. The reason for symptom occurrence lies in the SARS-CoV-2 capability of binding to exact receptors, among other angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors in gastrointestinal lining and neuropilin-1 (NRP-1) in the nervous system, which leads to loss of gastrointestinal and blood-brain barriers integrity and function. The data are mounting that SARS-CoV-2 can trigger systemic inflammation and lead to disruption of gut-brain axis (GBA) and the development of disorders of gut brain interaction (DGBIs). Functional dyspepsia (FD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are the most common DGBIs syndromes. On the other hand, emotional disorders have also been demonstrated as DGBIs. Currently, there are no official recommendations or recommended procedures for the use of probiotics in patients with COVID-19. However, it can be assumed that many doctors, pharmacists, and patients will want to use a probiotic in the treatment of this disease. In such cases, strains with documented activity should be used. There is a constant need to plan and conduct new trials on the role of probiotics and verify their clinical efficacy for counteracting the negative consequences of COVID-19 pandemic. Quality control is another important but often neglected aspect in trials utilizing probiotics in various clinical entities. It determines the safety and efficacy of probiotics, which is of utmost importance in patients with post-acute COVID-19 syndrome.
