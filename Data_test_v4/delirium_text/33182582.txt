33182582|a|Dysregulation of the type 17 immune pathway has already been considered in schizophrenia and we previously measured decreased sera values of interleukin (IL)-17 in early stages. We further explored the possible correlation of IL-17 systemic levels with proinflammatory cytokines and cognitive scores and additionally analyzed the percentage of IL-17 producing lymphocytes in peripheral blood of patients with stable schizophrenia. We included 27 patients diagnosed with schizophrenia (F20), after a three-month stable depot antipsychotic therapy (risperidone or paliperidone) and 18 healthy control subjects. Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale of Schizophrenia and the Montreal-Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) were conducted. Sera concentrations of IL-17, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and soluble ST2 receptor (sST2) were measured. Flow cytometry and Natural Killer (NK) and T cell analyses were done in 10 patients and 10 healthy controls. Moderate positive correlation was established between IL-17 and TNF-alpha (r = 0.640; p = 0.001), IL-17 and IL-6 (r = 0.514; p = 0.006), IL-17 and sST2 (r = 0.394; p = 0.042). Furthermore, a positive correlation between the serum levels of IL-17 and MoCA scores was observed, especially with visuospatial and executive functioning, as well as language functioning and delayed recall (p < 0.05). Significantly higher percentage of IL-17 producing CD56+ NK cells was measured in peripheral blood of patients with schizophrenia in remission vs. healthy individuals (p = 0.001). The percentage of CD4+ T cells and CD4+ T cells that produce IL-17 was significantly increased in patients (p = 0.001). This study revealed the involvement of innate type 17 immune response in the progression of inflammation and this could be related to cognitive functioning in stable schizophrenia.
