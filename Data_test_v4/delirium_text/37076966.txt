37076966|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease affects millions of people worldwide, and very few drugs are available for its treatment. Monoclonal antibodies have shown promising effects in the treatment of various types of diseases. Bapineuzumab is one of the humanized monoclonal antibodies, which have shown promising effects in AD patients. Bapineuzumab has shown efficacy in the treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. However, its safety is still unclear. OBJECTIVE: Thus, the main objective of the current study is to find out the exact safety profile of bapineuzumab in the treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. METHODOLOGY: We performed a web-based literature search of PubMed and clinical trial websites using the relevant keywords. Data were extracted from eligible records, and the risk ratio (RR) was calculated with a 95% confidence interval (CI). All the analyses were performed using Review Manager software (version 5.3 for windows). Heterogeneity was measured by Chi-square and I-square tests. RESULTS: Non-significant association of bapineuzumab with serious treatment-emergent adverse events [RR: 1.11 (0.92, 1.35)], headache [RR: 1.03 (0.81, 1.32)], delirium [RR: 2.21 (0.36, 13.53)], vomiting [RR: 0.92 (0.55, 1.55)], hypertension [RR: 0.49 (0.12, 2.12)], convulsions [RR:2.23 (0.42, 11.71)], falls [RR: 0.98 (0.80, 1.21)], fatal AEs [RR: 1.18 (0.59, 2.39)], and neoplasms [RR:1.81 (0.07, 49.52)] was reported; however, a significant association was found with vasogenic edema [RR: 22.58 (3.48, 146.44)]. CONCLUSION: Based on available evidence, bapineuzumab is found to be safe in the treatment of AD patients. However, vasogenic edema should be considered.
