38228652|t|Golgi-targeting viscosity probe for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.
38228652|a|Early diagnosis and intervention of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are particularly important to delay the pathological progression. Although fluorescent probes have been widely employed for investigating and diagnosing AD, their biological applications are significantly restricted due to the low penetration ability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in vivo. In this study, we reported the first Golgi-targeted two-photon (TP) fluorescent probe, DCM-DH, for detecting viscosity in the Golgi apparatus. The probe was rationally designed to exhibit superior analytical performance including high sensitivity, specific Golgi-targeting, efficient BBB penetration ability, and deep tissue penetration (247 mum) in the brains of AD model mice. Using the probe, we demonstrated that the fluorescence intensity in the human liver cancer cell (HepG2 cells) was higher than that of human normal liver cell (LO2 cells), and the brain viscosity of AD model mice increased significantly. We anticipate that this competent tool could be easily extended to other AD biomarkers for fundamental research on this detrimental disease.
