38954224|t|Formulation and Characterization of Silibinin Entrapped Nano-Liquid Crystals for Activity against Abeta1-42 Neurotoxicity in In-Vivo Model.
38954224|a|Silibinin (SIL) Encapsulated Nanoliquid Crystalline (SIL-NLCs) particles were prepared to study neuroprotective effect against amyloid beta (Abeta1-42) neurotoxicity in Balb/c mice model. Theses NLCs were prepared through hot emulsification and probe sonication technique. The pharmacodynamics was investigatigated on Abeta1-42 intracerebroventricular (ICV) injected Balb/c mice. The particle size, zeta potential and drug loading were optimized to be 153 +- 2.5 nm, -21 mV, and 8.2%, respectively. Small angle X-ray (SAXS) and electron microscopy revealed to crystalline shape of SIL-NLCs. Thioflavin T (ThT) fluroscence and circular dichroism (CD) technique were employed to understand monomer inhibition effect of SIL-NLCs on Abeta1-4. In neurobehavioral studies, SIL-NLCs exhibited enhanced mitigation of memory impairment induced on by Abeta1-42 in T-maze and new object recognition test (NORT). Whereas biochemical and histopathological estimation of brain samples showed reduction in level of Abeta1-42 aggregate, acetylcholine esterase (ACHE) and reactive oxygen species (ROS). SIL-NLCs treated animal group showed higher protection against Abeta1-42 toxicity compared to free SIL and Donopezil (DPZ). Therefore SIL-NLCs promises great prospect in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease.
