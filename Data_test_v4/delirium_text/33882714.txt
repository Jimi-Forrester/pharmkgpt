33882714|a|Notum has recently been identified as a negative regulator of Wnt signaling through the removal of an essential palmitoleate group from Wnt proteins. There are emerging reports that Notum plays a role in human disease, with published data suggesting that targeting Notum could represent a new therapeutic approach for treating cancer, osteoporosis and neurodegenerative disorders. Complementary hit-finding strategies have been applied with successful approaches that include high-throughput screening, activity-based protein profiling, screening of fragment libraries and virtual screening campaigns. Structural studies are accelerating the discovery of new inhibitors of Notum. Three fit-for-purpose examples are LP-922056, ABC99 and ARUK3001185. The application of these small-molecule inhibitors is helping to further advance an understanding of the role Notum plays in human disease.
