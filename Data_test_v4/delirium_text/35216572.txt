35216572|a|BACKGROUND: Multiple system atrophy (MSA) associated with neuroleptic malignant-like syndrome (NMLS) is rare and few cases have been described in the literature. CASE PRESENTATION: In the present study, three patients with MSA associated with NMLS were analyzed from January 2012 to January 2020 to characterize their clinical presentations. Data collected from the patients for analysis included general patient history, the fluctuation and severity of disease symptoms, the indicated therapies and disease progression at follow-up. All patients had histories of sudden withdrawal or reduction of levodopa prior to the onset of symptoms. Clinical presentations were characterized by hyperthermia, autonomic dysfunction, worsening of extrapyramidal symptoms, and elevated serum creatine kinase (CK) levels. During hospitalization, one patient rapidly progressed and died, while the other two patients were successfully treated. CONCLUSIONS: Early diagnosis and treatment are very important for patient outcomes in NMLS. Notably, the correct dose and time of administration of dopaminergic medication may be key in treating NMLS.
