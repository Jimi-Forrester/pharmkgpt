34222237|t|The Emerging Roles of the RNA Binding Protein QKI in Cardiovascular Development and Function.
34222237|a|RNA binding proteins (RBPs) have a broad biological and physiological function and are critical in regulating pre-mRNA posttranscriptional processing, intracellular migration, and mRNA stability. QKI, also known as Quaking, is a member of the signal transduction and activation of RNA (STAR) family, which also belongs to the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K- (hnRNP K-) homology domain protein family. There are three major alternatively spliced isoforms, QKI-5, QKI-6, and QKI-7, differing in carboxy-terminal domains. They share a common RNA binding property, but each isoform can regulate pre-mRNA splicing, transportation or stability differently in a unique cell type-specific manner. Previously, QKI has been known for its important role in contributing to neurological disorders. A series of recent work has further demonstrated that QKI has important roles in much broader biological systems, such as cardiovascular development, monocyte to macrophage differentiation, bone metabolism, and cancer progression. In this mini-review, we will focus on discussing the emerging roles of QKI in regulating cardiac and vascular development and function and its potential link to cardiovascular pathophysiology.
