38852977|t|Pulmonary Artery Calcification in a 57-Year-Old Man.
38852977|a|CASE PRESENTATION: A 57-year-old man was admitted to our hospital via the ED presenting in reduced general condition because of an infection of unknown origin, generalized edema, and dyspnea at rest (peripheral capillary oxygen saturation, 89%) that required 2 L/min intranasal oxygen. Anamnesis was complicated by an infection-triggered delirium, but his wife reported an increasing physical decay that had led to bed confinement. The BP was reduced at 88/55 mm Hg with a normal heart rate of 86 beats/min. Lung auscultation showed mild bipulmonal rales. Previous comorbidities were a BMI of 42 kg/m2, an insulin-dependent type 2 diabetes mellitus with a severe diabetes-related chronic kidney disease stage G4A3, and systemic arterial hypertension.
