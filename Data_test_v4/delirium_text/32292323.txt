32292323|t|The Impact of Early Deafness on Brain Plasticity: A Systematic Review of the White and Gray Matter Changes.
32292323|a|Background: Auditory deprivation alters cortical and subcortical brain regions, primarily linked to auditory and language processing, resulting in behavioral consequences. Neuroimaging studies have reported various degrees of structural changes, yet multiple variables in deafness profiles need to be considered for proper interpretation of results. To date, many inconsistencies are reported in the gray and white matter alterations following early profound deafness. The purpose of this study was to provide the first systematic review synthesizing gray and white matter changes in deaf individuals. Methods: We conducted a systematic review according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement in 27 studies comprising 626 deaf individuals. Results: Evidence shows that auditory deprivation significantly alters the white matter across the primary and secondary auditory cortices. The most consistent alteration across studies was in the bilateral superior temporal gyri. Furthermore, reductions in the fractional anisotropy of white matter fibers comprising in inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, the superior longitudinal fasciculus, and the subcortical auditory pathway are reported. The reviewed studies also suggest that gray and white matter integrity is sensitive to early sign language acquisition, attenuating the effect of auditory deprivation on neurocognitive development. Conclusions: These findings suggest that understanding cortical reorganization through gray and white matter changes in auditory and non-auditory areas is an important factor in the development of auditory rehabilitation strategies in the deaf population.
