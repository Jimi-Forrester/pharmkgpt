39219949|a|This review investigates the potential of neurosteroids, including brexanolone, zuranolone, sepranolone, and ganaxalone, as therapeutic agents for a range of mood and neurological disorders. Notably, these disorders encompass postpartum depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), major depressive disorder (MDD), epilepsy, and Alzheimer's disease. Brexanolone and zuranolone have emerged as frontrunners in the treatment of postpartum depression, offering rapid relief from debilitating symptoms. Their mechanism of action involves modulation of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) system, which plays a pivotal role in mood regulation. Clinical trials have demonstrated their efficacy, heralding a potential breakthrough in addressing this often-overlooked condition. In the context of PTSD and MDD, neurosteroids have demonstrated significant promise. Their positive allosteric modulation of GABA-A receptors translates into improved mood stabilization and reduced symptoms. This novel approach represents a departure from conventional treatments and could offer newfound hope for individuals grappling with these disorders. Beyond mood disorders, neurosteroids, especially ganaxalone, exhibit potential in the realm of epilepsy management. Ganaxalone's capacity to control seizures is attributed to its GABAergic activity, which helps restore the delicate balance of neurotransmission in epileptic brains. Moreover, neurosteroids have revealed neuroprotective properties in Alzheimer's disease models. By influencing the GABAergic system, they mitigate excitotoxicity, a hallmark of Alzheimer's pathology. This neuroprotection opens a novel avenue for slowing neurodegeneration, although further research and clinical validation are essential. In conclusion, this review underscores the substantial therapeutic promise of neurosteroids in mood and neurological disorders. Their modulation of the GABA system emerges as a central mechanism of action, emphasizing the importance of GABAergic signaling in these conditions. The path forward entails continued investigation and clinical trials to fully unlock the potential of neurosteroids, offering hope for enhanced treatments in these challenging clinical domains.
