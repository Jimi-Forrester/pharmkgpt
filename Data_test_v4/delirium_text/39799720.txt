39799720|a|Pyrimidines are aromatic, heterocyclic organic compounds characterized by a six-membered ring that contains four carbon atoms and two nitrogen atoms. They have been reported to exhibit a variety of biological activities such as antifungal, antiviral, and anti-Parkinsonian effects. Recently, there has been an increased focus on their potential anti-Alzheimer's properties. Several pyrimidine-based drugs and their analogs are currently undergoing various phases of clinical trials, indicating pyrimidine as a promising chemical structure for drug development. Notably, modifications to the pyrimidine structure significantly influence their activity against Alzheimer's disease. For instance, the introduction of heteroatoms into the pyrimidine ring or alternations in the length of the linkage region have been shown to enhance therapeutic efficacy. This review provides a comprehensive overview of pyrimidine derivatives as potential therapeutics for Alzheimer's disease, with a focus on structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies, design strategies, and binding mechanisms. These insights could pave the way for the development of more effective anti-Alzheimer's medications.
