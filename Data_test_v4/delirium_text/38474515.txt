38474515|t|Surface Plasmon Resonance Enhanced Photoelectrochemical Sensing of Cysteine Based on Au Nanoparticle-Decorated ZnO@graphene Quantum Dots.
38474515|a|In this work, Au nanoparticle-decorated ZnO@graphene core-shell quantum dots (Au-ZnO@graphene QDs) were successfully prepared and firstly used to modify an ITO electrode for the construction of a novel photoelectrochemical biosensor (Au-ZnO@graphene QDs/ITO). Characterization of the prepared nanomaterials was conducted using transmission electron microscopy, steady-state fluorescence spectroscopy and the X-ray diffraction method. The results indicated that the synthesized ternary nanomaterials displayed excellent photoelectrochemical performance, which was much better than that of ZnO@graphene QDs and pristine ZnO quantum dots. The graphene and ZnO quantum dots formed an effective interfacial electric field, enhancing photogenerated electron-hole pairs separation and leading to a remarkable improvement in the photoelectrochemical performance of ZnO@graphene QDs. The strong surface plasmon resonance effect achieved by directly attaching Au nanoparticles to ZnO@graphene QDs led to a notable increase in the photocurrent response through electrochemical field effect amplification. Based on the specifical recognition between cysteine and Au-ZnO@graphene QDs/ITO through the specificity of Au-S bonds, a light-driven photoelectrochemical sensor was fabricated for cysteine detection. The novel photoelectrochemical biosensor exhibited outstanding analytical capabilities in detecting cysteine with an extremely low detection limit of 8.9 nM and excellent selectivity. Hence, the Au-ZnO@graphene QDs is a promising candidate as a novel advanced photosensitive material in the field of photoelectrochemical biosensing.
