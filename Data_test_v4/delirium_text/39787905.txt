39787905|t|The global research trends in perioperative cognitive function protection for preventing postoperative delirium: A bibliometric analysis.
39787905|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: This study aims to analyze the global trends and current status of perioperative cognitive function protection for preventing postoperative delirium(PCFP-POD), as well as to predict research hotspots. METHODS: We conducted a literature search on the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) and selected articles published between January 1, 2014, and December 31, 2023, related to PCFP-POD. The retrieved data were subjected to bibliometric analysis and visualization using CiteSpace 6.2.R4, VOSviewer 1.6.20 software, and the Bibliometrics website. RESULTS: A total of 355 articles published between 2014 and 2023 were retrieved from the online databases. The number of publications on perioperative cognitive function protection for preventing postoperative delirium sharply increased from 2018 onwards. Key themes included drug and non-drug interventions, postoperative cognitive dysfunction in cardiac and hip surgery, and the effects of anesthetic drugs. High-frequency keywords included postoperative delirium, intervention, postoperative cognitive impairment, and cognitive training. CONCLUSION: The number of research articles on PCFP-POD increased significantly from 2014 to 2023. Future research trends may focus on cognitive function protection related to surgical categories, anesthesia methods, electroencephalogram monitoring, and nursing care.
