37373121|a|Histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) is involved in the regulation of protein aggregation and neuroinflammation, but its role in Parkinson's disease (PD) remains controversial. In this study, Hdac6-/- mice were generated by CRISPR-Cas9 technology for exploring the effect of HDAC6 on the pathological progression of PD. We found that male Hdac6-/- mice exhibit hyperactivity and certain anxiety. In the acute 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD mice, though motor injury was slightly alleviated by HDAC6 deficiency, dopamine (DA) depletion in the striatum, the decrease in the number of DA neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) and the reduction in DA neuronal terminals were not affected. In addition, activation of glial cells and the expression of alpha-synuclein, as well as the levels of apoptosis-related proteins in the nigrostriatal pathway, were not changed in MPTP-injected wild-type and Hdac6-/- mice. Therefore, HDAC6 deficiency leads to moderate alterations of behaviors and Parkinson's disease pathology in mice.
