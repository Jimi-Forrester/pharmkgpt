39230033|a|Objective.With prolonged life expectancy, the incidence of memory deficits, especially in Alzheimer's disease (AD), has increased. Although multiple treatments have been evaluated, no promising treatment has been found to date. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the fornix area was explored as a possible treatment because the fornix is intimately connected to memory-related areas that are vulnerable in AD; however, a proper imaging biomarker for assessing the therapeutic efficiency of forniceal DBS in AD has not been established.Approach.This study assessed the efficacy and safety of DBS by estimating the optimal intersection volume between the volume of tissue activated and the fornix. Utilizing a gold-electroplating process, the microelectrode's surface area on the neural probe was increased, enhancing charge transfer performance within potential water window limits. Bilateral fornix implantation was conducted in triple-transgenic AD mice (3 x Tg-AD) and wild-type mice (strain: B6129SF1/J), with forniceal DBS administered exclusively to 3 x Tg-AD mice in the DBS-on group. Behavioral tasks, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were performed in all mice to assess the therapeutic efficacy of forniceal DBS.Main results.The results illustrated that memory deficits and increased anxiety-like behavior in 3 x Tg-AD mice were rescued by forniceal DBS. Furthermore, forniceal DBS positively altered DTI indices, such as increasing fractional anisotropy (FA) and decreasing mean diffusivity (MD), together with reducing microglial cell and astrocyte counts, suggesting a potential causal relationship between revised FA/MD and reduced cell counts in the anterior cingulate cortex, hippocampus, fornix, amygdala, and entorhinal cortex of 3 x Tg-AD mice following forniceal DBS.Significance.The efficacy of forniceal DBS in AD can be indicated by alterations in DTI-based biomarkers reflecting the decreased activation of glial cells, suggesting reduced neural inflammation as evidenced by improvements in memory and anxiety-like behavior.
