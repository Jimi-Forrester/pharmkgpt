15992583|a|In search of novel therapeutic approaches for Alzheimer's disease (AD), we report herein the identification, design, synthesis, and pharmacological activity of (4-ethyl-piperaz-1-yl)-phenylmethanone derivatives with neuroprotective properties against beta-amyloid-induced toxicity. (4-ethyl-piperaz-1-yl)-phenylmethanone is a common substructure shared by molecules isolated from plants of the Asteraceae genus, traditionally used as restorative of lost or declining mental functions. (4-Ethyl-piperaz-1-yl)-phenylmethanone displayed strong neuroprotective properties against Abeta1-42 and reversed Abeta1-42-induced ATP depletion on neuronal cells, suggesting a mitochondrial site of action. Abeta1-42 has been described to induce a hyperactivity of the glutamate network in neuronal cells. (4-Ethyl-piperaz-1-yl)-phenylmethanone also inhibited the neurotoxic effect that glutamate displayed on PC12 cells, suggesting that the reduction of glutamate-induced neurotoxicity may be one of the mechanisms by which this compound exerts its neuroprotective properties against the deleterious effects of the Abeta1-42. These data suggest that the identified (4-ethyl-piperaz-1-yl)-phenylmethanone chemical entity exerts neuroprotective properties and may serve as a lead compound for the development of novel therapies for AD.
