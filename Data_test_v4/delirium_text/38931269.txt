38931269|t|Nailfold Capillaroscopy: A Comprehensive Review on Its Usefulness in Both Clinical Diagnosis and Improving Unhealthy Dietary Lifestyles.
38931269|a|Since the 1970s, the utility of nailfold capillaroscopy (NFC) in diagnosing rheumatological disorders such as systemic sclerosis has been well established. Further studies have also shown that NFC can detect non-rheumatic diseases such as diabetes, glaucoma, dermatitis, and Alzheimer disease. In the past decade, nailfold capillary morphological changes have also been reported as symptoms of unhealthy lifestyle habits such as poor diet, smoking, sleep deprivation, and even psychological stress, all of which contribute to slow blood flow. Therefore, studying the relationships between the morphology of nailfold capillaries and lifestyle habits has a high potential to indicate unhealthy states or even pre-disease conditions. Simple, inexpensive, and non-invasive methods such as NFC are important and useful for routine medical examinations. The present study began with a systematic literature search of the PubMed database followed by a summary of studies reporting the assessment of morphological changes detected by NFC, and a comprehensive review of NFC's utility in clinical diagnosis and improving unhealthy dietary lifestyles. It culminates in a summary of dietary and lifestyle health promotion strategy, assessed based on NFC and other related measurements that indicate healthy microvascular blood flow and endothelial function.
