35204815|t|Insulin-Degrading Enzyme Is a Non Proteasomal Target of Carfilzomib and Affects the 20S Proteasome Inhibition by the Drug.
35204815|a|Carfilzomib is a last generation proteasome inhibitor (PI) with proven clinical efficacy in the treatment of relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. This drug is considered to be extremely specific in inhibiting the chymotrypsin-like activity of the 20S proteasome, encoded by the beta5 subunit, overcoming some bortezomib limitations, the first PI approved for multiple myeloma therapy which is however burdened by a significant toxicity profile, due also to its off-target effects. Here, molecular approaches coupled with molecular docking studies have been used to unveil that the Insulin-Degrading Enzyme, a ubiquitous and highly conserved Zn2+ peptidase, often found to associate with proteasome in cell-based models, is targeted by carfilzomib in vitro. The drug behaves as a modulator of IDE activity, displaying an inhibitory effect over 10-fold lower than for the 20S. Notably, the interaction of IDE with the 20S enhances in vitro the inhibitory power of carfilzomib on proteasome, so that the IDE-20S complex is an even better target of carfilzomib than the 20S alone. Furthermore, IDE gene silencing after delivery of antisense oligonucleotides (siRNA) significantly reduced carfilzomib cytotoxicity in rMC1 cells, a validated model of Muller glia, suggesting that, in cells, the inhibitory activity of this drug on cell proliferation is somewhat linked to IDE and, possibly, also to its interaction with proteasome.
