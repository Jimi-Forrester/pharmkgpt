31489032|a|The cblC defect is the most common inborn error of cobalamin (Cbl) metabolism. Clinical severity and presentation of the cblC defect ranges from death to mild disability. Only 71 cases of late-onset cblC defect have been described in the literature. We provide the 41-year follow up of two siblings with a late-onset cblC defect, first described after initial diagnosis in 1996. While one of the siblings showed initial symptoms resembling multiple sclerosis with a good response to corticosteroids, the other sister showed only subclinical signs of the disease. The course of the first case was characterized by a severe deterioration and intensive-care therapy after respiratory failure. After diagnoses and Cbl treatment, the patient survived and showed a pronounced improvement of the symptoms. Both sisters have an active life and gave birth to healthy children. The reason for the initial improvement after corticosteroids could not be explained by the classical metabolic pathways of Cbl. Recent studies have suggested that Cbl plays an important role as a regulator of the balance between neurotrophic and neurotoxic factors in the central and peripheral nervous system (CNS and PNS). This first long-term follow up revealed that ultra-high-dose intramuscular Hydroxocobalamin (OH-Cbl) treatment can effectively protect patients from disease progression. It underlines the importance of diagnostic vigilance and laboratory work up even in cases without typical hematologic signs of Cbl deficiency. Cbl-related diseases are often a chameleon and must always be considered in the differential of demyelinating diseases of the PNS and CNS. The case supports the theory that it is not only the classical biochemical pathways that play a key role in Cbl deficiency, especially with regard to neurological symptoms.
