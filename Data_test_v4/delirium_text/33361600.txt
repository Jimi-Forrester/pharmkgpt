33361600|t|Cingulate Island Sign in Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography: Clinical Biomarker Correlations in Lewy Body Disease and Alzheimer's Disease.
33361600|a|We compared 'CIScore' determined by quantitative single photon emission computed tomography studies of the cingulate island sign to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers in Lewy body disease (LBD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) to assess its usefulness and pathological background. Among the 16 each age-matched LBD and AD patients, the CIScore differed significantly but was not correlated with CSF biomarkers. In LBD, hippocampal atrophy significantly correlated with Clinical Dementia Rating and CSF p-tau and t-tau levels. Our results showed CIS was not related to CSF biomarkers in LBD and high CSF tau levels were related to clinical disease severity and hippocampal atrophy.
