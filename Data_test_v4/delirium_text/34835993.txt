34835993|t|Iron and Neurodevelopment in Preterm Infants: A Narrative Review.
34835993|a|Iron is critical for brain development, playing key roles in synaptogenesis, myelination, energy metabolism and neurotransmitter production. NICU infants are at particular risk for iron deficiency due to high iron needs, preterm birth, disruptions in maternal or placental health and phlebotomy. If deficiency occurs during critical periods of brain development, this may lead to permanent alterations in brain structure and function which is not reversible despite later supplementation. Children with perinatal iron deficiency have been shown to have delayed nerve conduction speeds, disrupted sleep patterns, impaired recognition memory, motor deficits and lower global developmental scores which may be present as early as in the neonatal period and persist into adulthood. Based on this, ensuring brain iron sufficiency during the neonatal period is critical to optimizing neurodevelopmental outcomes and iron supplementation should be targeted to iron measures that correlate with improved outcomes.
