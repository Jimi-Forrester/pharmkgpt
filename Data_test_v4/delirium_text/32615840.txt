32615840|t|Association of Saitohin gene rs62063857 polymorphism with dry type age-related macular degeneration.
32615840|a|PURPOSE: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) as the leading cause of central visual loss in the developed countries has extensive pathologic similarities with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Saitohin rs62063857 Q7 R polymorphism is associated with increased risk of AD though we decided to evaluate the possible association of this polymorphism with advanced AMD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 152 advanced AMD patients (134 wet AMD and 18 geographic atrophy) and 75 healthy controls included in this study. Cases and controls went through a standard ophthalmologic examination by a retinal specialist. Saitohin gene rs62063857 polymorphism determined by using PCR technique and restriction enzyme HinFI. To evaluate the differences between groups we used t-test, Chi-Squared and one-tailed Fisher exact test. RESULTS: Distribution of genotypes was not significantly different between total AMD or wet AMD patients compared to that of controls (total AMD RR+QR: OR = 1.51, CI = 0.82-2.79, P = .12; wet AMD RR+QR: OR = 1.39, CI = 0.74-2.59, P = .19). The RR+QR genotypes were significantly higher in dry AMD group compared to that of controls (RR+QR: OR = 2.75, CI = 0.96-7.9, P = .05). CONCLUSION: Our results showed that although STH Q7 R polymorphism was not associated with wet AMD susceptibility it was significantly associated with geographic atrophy.
