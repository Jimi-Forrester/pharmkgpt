37762232|t|In Silico Neuroprotective Effects of Specific Rheum palmatum Metabolites on Parkinson's Disease Targets.
37762232|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the large-scale health issues detrimental to human quality of life, and current treatments are only focused on neuroprotection and easing symptoms. This study evaluated in silico binding activity and estimated the stability of major metabolites in the roots of R. palmatum (RP) with main protein targets in Parkinson's disease and their ADMET properties. The major metabolites of RP were subjected to molecular docking and QSAR with alpha-synuclein, monoamine oxidase isoform B, catechol o-methyltransferase, and A2A adenosine receptor. From this, emodin had the greatest binding activity with Parkinson's disease targets. The chemical stability of the selected compounds was estimated using density functional theory analyses. The docked compounds showed good stability for inhibitory action compared to dopamine and levodopa. According to their structure-activity relationship, aloe-emodin, chrysophanol, emodin, and rhein exhibited good inhibitory activity to specific targets. Finally, mediocre pharmacokinetic properties were observed due to unexceptional blood-brain barrier penetration and safety profile. It was revealed that the major metabolites of RP may have good neuroprotective activity as an additional hit for PD drug development. Also, an association between redox-mediating and activities with PD-relevant protein targets was observed, potentially opening discussion on electrochemical mechanisms with biological functions.
