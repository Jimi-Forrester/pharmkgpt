38219919|a|AIMS: The gut microbiota is increasingly recognised as a pivotal regulator of immune system homeostasis and brain health. Recent research has implicated the gut microbiota in age-related cognitive impairment and dementia. Agathobaculum butyriciproducens SR79 T (SR79), which was identified in the human gut, has been reported to be beneficial in addressing cognitive deficits and pathophysiologies in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. However, it remains unknown whether SR79 affects age-dependent cognitive impairment. MAIN METHOD: To explore the effects of SR79 on cognitive function during ageing, we administered SR79 to aged mice. Ageing-associated behavioural alterations were examined using the open field test (OFT), tail suspension test (TST), novel object recognition test (NORT), Y-maze alternation test (Y-maze), and Morris water maze test (MWM). We investigated the mechanisms of action in the gut and brain using molecular and histological analyses. KEY FINDINGS: Administration of SR79 improved age-related cognitive impairment without altering general locomotor activity or depressive behaviour in aged mice. Furthermore, SR79 increased mature dendritic spines in the pyramidal cells of layer III and phosphorylation of CaMKIIalpha in the cortex of aged mice. Age-related activation of astrocytes in the cortex of layers III-V of the aged brain was reduced following SR79 administration. Additionally, SR79 markedly increased IL-10 production and Foxp3 and Muc2 mRNA expression in the colons of aged mice. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings suggest that treatment with SR79 may be a beneficial microbial-based approach for enhancing cognitive function during ageing.
