35052644|t|Potential and Possible Therapeutic Effects of Melatonin on SARS-CoV-2 Infection.
35052644|a|The absence of effective drugs for COVID-19 prevention and treatment requires the search for new candidates among approved medicines. Fundamental studies and clinical observations allow us to approach an understanding of the mechanisms of damage and protection from exposure to SARS-CoV-2, to identify possible points of application for pharmacological interventions. In this review we presented studies on the anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and immunotropic properties of melatonin. We have attempted to present scientifically proven mechanisms of action for the potential therapeutic use of melatonin during SARS-CoV-2 infection. A wide range of pharmacological properties allows its inclusion as an effective addition to the methods of prevention and treatment of COVID-19.
