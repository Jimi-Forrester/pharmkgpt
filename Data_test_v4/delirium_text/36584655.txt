36584655|a|Opioid use disorder (OUD) has become a national crisis and contributes to the spread of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Emerging evidence and advances in experimental models, methodology, and our understanding of disease processes at the molecular and cellular levels reveal that opioids per se can directly exacerbate the pathophysiology of neuroHIV. Despite substantial inroads, the impact of OUD on the severity, development, and prognosis of neuroHIV and HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders is not fully understood. In this review, we explore current evidence that OUD and neuroHIV interact to accelerate cognitive deficits and enhance the neurodegenerative changes typically seen with aging, through their effects on neuroinflammation. We suggest new thoughts on the processes that may underlie accelerated brain aging, including dysregulation of neuronal inhibition, and highlight findings suggesting that opioids, through actions at the mu-opioid receptor, interact with HIV in the central nervous system to promote unique structural and functional comorbid deficits not seen in either OUD or neuroHIV alone.
