32089783|t|The Impact of Health Resort Treatment on the Nonenzymatic Endogenous Antioxidant System.
32089783|a|Introduction. Oxygen, reacting with organic compounds in living organisms, oxidizes them without being completely reduced due to numerous exogenous as well as endogenous factors. As a consequence, free radicals or reactive oxygen species are formed. Health resort-based balneophysiotherapy is a comprehensive therapeutic intervention that triggers positive therapeutic effects within the entire system. Material and Methods. The objective of the study was to assess the impact of health resort-based balneophysiotherapy on the levels of nonenzymatic endogenous antioxidants in patients with degenerative motor organ diseases, as well as to determine potential correlation of these changes with free radical-mediated processes. Observation was carried out in patients undergoing health resort therapy as part of 21-day stay periods. The study population consisted of n = 110 patients with articular and spinal pains due to degenerative diseases or discopathies. RESULTS: Reduced bilirubin and albumin levels as well as increased uric acid levels were observed in the study group following the health resort treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Bilirubin and albumin levels were reduced while uric acid levels were increased as the result of health resort therapy in patients with degenerative motor organ diseases. The observed changes in the levels of nonenzymatic endogenous antioxidants depend on free radical-mediated systemic transformations. The trial is registered with NCT03405350.
