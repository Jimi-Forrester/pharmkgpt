38939386|t|Virtual Reality for Pain and Anxiety Management in Cardiac Surgery and Interventional Cardiology.
38939386|a|Pain and anxiety are common in patients undergoing cardiac surgery and percutaneous cardiac interventions. Virtual reality (VR) is an emerging non-pharmacological tool for pain and anxiety management. However, its application around cardiac procedures remains relatively unexplored. In this review, we perform a targeted non-systematic literature review to assess the current state-of-the-art of VR for pain and anxiety management in patients undergoing cardiac procedures. Contexts of interest were preprocedural, periprocedural, and postprocedural applications. Existing trials show inconsistent results. The majority of studies in the preprocedural (7 studies, n = 302), periprocedural (1 study, n = 99), and postprocedural stage (4 studies, n = 214) demonstrate significant reduction of pain and anxiety through VR distraction therapy or VR patient education. However, larger-scale trials (2 preprocedural studies [n = 233], 1 periprocedural study [n = 32], 2 postprocedural studies [n = 300]) report no effect. Current literature on effectiveness of VR for pain and anxiety management in cardiac surgery and interventional cardiology remains inconclusive.
