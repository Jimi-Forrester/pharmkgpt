36533155|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative dementias have a progressive course, impairing cognition, functional capacity, and behavior. Most studies have focused on AD. Severe dementia is associated with increased age, higher morbidity-mortality, and rising costs of care. It is fundamental to recognize that severe dementia is the longest period of progression, with patients living for many years in this stage. It is the most heterogeneous phase in the process, with different abilities and life expectancies. This practice guideline focuses on severe dementia to improve management and care in this stage of dementia. As it is a long period in the continuum of dementia, clinical practice should consider non-pharmacological and pharmacological approaches. Multidisciplinary interventions (physical therapy, speech therapy, nutrition, nursing, and others) are essential, besides educational and support to caregivers.
