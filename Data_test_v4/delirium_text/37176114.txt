37176114|t|A Predictive Model of Adaptive Resistance to BRAF/MEK Inhibitors in Melanoma.
37176114|a|The adaptive acquisition of resistance to BRAF and MEK inhibitor-based therapy is a common feature of melanoma cells and contributes to poor patient treatment outcomes. Leveraging insights from a proteomic study and publicly available transcriptomic data, we evaluated the predictive capacity of a gene panel corresponding to proteins differentially abundant between treatment-sensitive and treatment-resistant cell lines, deciphering predictors of treatment resistance and potential resistance mechanisms to BRAF/MEK inhibitor therapy in patient biopsy samples. From our analysis, a 13-gene signature panel, in both test and validation datasets, could identify treatment-resistant or progressed melanoma cases with an accuracy and sensitivity of over 70%. The dysregulation of HMOX1, ICAM, MMP2, and SPARC defined a BRAF/MEK treatment-resistant landscape, with resistant cases showing a >2-fold risk of expression of these genes. Furthermore, we utilized a combination of functional enrichment- and gene expression-derived scores to model and identify pathways, such as HMOX1-mediated mitochondrial stress response, as potential key drivers of the emergence of a BRAF/MEK inhibitor-resistant state in melanoma cells. Overall, our results highlight the utility of these genes in predicting treatment outcomes and the underlying mechanisms that can be targeted to reduce the development of resistance to BRAF/MEK targeted therapy.
