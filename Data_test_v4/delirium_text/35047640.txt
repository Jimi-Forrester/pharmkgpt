35047640|a|Individuals who fall from heights of >=6 m can suffer from complex pelvic and acetabular fractures. The extent to which an intentional fall correlates with prognosis and outcome after osteosynthesis is unclear. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the clinical outcomes of fallers with pelvic and acetabular fractures after osteosynthesis and compare the radiological and functional outcomes between intentional and accidental fallers. We retrospectively reviewed 49 fallers who fell from heights of >=6 m, developed pelvic and acetabular fractures, survived after resuscitation, and completed surgical treatment between 2014 and 2017. Fallers were divided into intentional and accidental fallers. Sixteen patients were intentional fallers, whereas the rest of the patients were accidental fallers. Psychiatric counseling was provided to each of the intentional fallers during follow-up. All intentional fallers had preexisting mental disorders, and the most common diagnosis was adjustment disorder. The group of intentional fallers predominantly comprised females that had a higher injury and new injury severity scores and longer hospital stays. However, early loss of fixation (<3 months) and functional outcomes (Merle d'Aubigne and Majeed hip scores at 6- and 12-month follow-ups) did not significantly differ between intentional and accidental fallers. We found that intentional fallers with pelvic and acetabular fractures may have more severe combined injuries compared to accidental fallers. However, the radiological and functional outcomes of the intentional fallers after osteosynthesis were not inferior to those of the accidental fallers with the implementation of well-designed surgical protocols and individualized physical and mental rehabilitation programs.
