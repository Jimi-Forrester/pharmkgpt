36934675|a|Previous research has emphasized the unique impact of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) pathology on the medial temporal lobe (MTL), a reflection that tau pathology is particularly striking in the entorhinal and transentorhinal cortex (ERC, TEC) early in the course of disease. However, other brain regions are affected by AD pathology during its early phases. Here, we use longitudinal diffeomorphometry to measure the atrophy rate from MRI of the amygdala compared with that in the ERC and TEC in cognitively unimpaired (CU) controls, CU individuals who progressed to mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and individuals with MCI who progressed to dementia of the AD type (DAT), using a dataset from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Our results show significantly higher atrophy rates of the amygdala in both groups of 'converters' (CU MCI, MCI DAT) compared to controls, with rates of volume loss comparable to rates of thickness loss in the ERC and TEC. We localize atrophy within the amygdala within each of these groups using fixed effects modeling. Controlling for the familywise error rate highlights the medial regions of the amygdala as those with significantly higher atrophy in both groups of converters than in controls. Using our recently developed method, referred to as Projective LDDMM, we map measures of neurofibrillary tau tangles (NFTs) from digital pathology to MRI atlases and reconstruct dense 3D spatial distributions of NFT density within regions of the MTL. The distribution of NFTs is consistent with the spatial distribution of MR measured atrophy rates, revealing high densities (and atrophy) in the amygdala (particularly medial), ERC, and rostral third of the MTL. The similarity of the location of NFTs in AD and shape changes in a well-defined clinical population suggests that amygdalar atrophy rate, as measured through MRI may be a viable biomarker for AD.
