35466933|a|BACKGROUND: Determining amyloid positivity is possible with cerebrospinal fluid and brain imaging of amyloid, but these methods are invasive and expensive. OBJECTIVE: To relate plasma amyloid-beta (Abeta), measured using Single-molecule array (Simoatrademark) assays, to in vivo brain Abeta, measured using positron emission tomography (PET), examine the accuracy of plasma Abeta to predict brain Abeta positivity, and the relation of APOE e4 with plasma Abeta. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional analysis in a cohort of 345 late middle-aged Hispanic men and women (age 64 years, 72% women). Our primary plasma variable was Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio measured with Simoa. Brain Abeta burden was measured as global SUVR with 18F-Florbetaben PET examined continuously and categorically. RESULTS: Plasma Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio was inversely associated with global Abeta SUVR (beta= -0.13, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): -0.23, -0.03; p = 0.013) and Abeta positivity (Odds Ratio: 0.59, 95% CI: 0.38, 0.91; p = 0.016), independent of demographics and APOE e4. ROC curves (AUC = 0.73, 95% CI: 0.64, 0.82; p < 0.0001) showed that the optimal threshold for plasma Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio in relation to brain Abeta positivity was 0.060 with a sensitivity of 82.4% and specificity of 62.8%. APOE e4 carriers had lower Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio and a higher Abeta positivity determined with the Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio threshold of 0.060. CONCLUSION: Plasma Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio assayed using Simoa is weakly correlated with in vivo brain amyloid and has limited accuracy in screening for amyloid positivity and for studying risk factors of brain amyloid burden when in vivo imaging is not feasible.
