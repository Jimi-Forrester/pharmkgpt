14978395|t|[Magnetic resonance studies in Alzheimer's dementia. What routine scanning shows].
14978395|a|Magnetic resonance images of the brain acquired in relationship to the commissural plane have been analyzed in twenty cases classified as Probable Alzheimer's disease (Pr. AD). These examinations have been compared to normal aged matched subjects. All examinations have been made in strict correlation with the planes defined by Talairach and Tournoux (1988). The analysis of brain cortical damage was made by evaluating the sulci of the brain mainly on coronal sections correlated with simultaneous image review of the same area on the two other orthogonal planes. In Pr. AD, an asymmetric atrophic pattern was found mainly on the following areas: amygdaloid nucleus, para hippocampal gyrus, hippocampus, areas 22 and 21, temporal pole, insula, dorso frontal cortex, angular gyrus, superior parietal lobule. The primary motor and visual areas were normal in all cases.
