33072324|a|A significant positive correlation was previously reported (Fox et al. Evol Med Public Health 2013; 2013:173-86) between hygiene and the global prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) based on World Health Organization (2004) data. These data have now been updated by the Global Burden of Disease (GBD; 2016) dataset that takes into account under-registration and other potential confounds. We therefore addressed whether the association between hygiene and AD is maintained in light of these more recent data. We report a significant positive correlation between GBD AD prevalence rates and parasite burden, and a negative association with hygiene. These newer data argue that hygiene is not a risk factor for AD, and instead suggest that parasite burden may increase AD risk. Lay summary: It was previously hypothesized that hygeine might be a risk factor for the development of Alzheimer disease (AD), based on a global gradient of dementia. Newer data that correct global AD rates for under-reporting now demonstrate that parasite burden is positively correlated with AD.
