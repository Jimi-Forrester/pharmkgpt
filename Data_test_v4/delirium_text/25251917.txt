25251917|t|Benzofuran-chalcone hybrids as potential multifunctional agents against Alzheimer's disease: synthesis and in vivo studies with transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans.
25251917|a|In the search for effective multifunctional agents for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a series of novel hybrids incorporating benzofuran and chalcone fragments were designed and synthesized. These hybrids were screened by using a transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans model that expresses the human beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptide. Among the hybrids investigated, (E)-3-(7-methyl-2-(4-methylbenzoyl)benzofuran-5-yl)-1-phenylprop-2-en-1-one (4 f), (E)-3-(2-benzoyl-7-methylbenzofuran-5-yl)-1-phenylprop-2-en-1-one (4 i), and (E)-3-(2-benzoyl-7-methylbenzofuran-5-yl)-1-(thiophen-2-yl)prop-2-en-1-one (4 m) significantly decreased Abeta aggregation and increased acetylcholine (ACh) levels along with the overall availability of ACh at the synaptic junction. These compounds were also found to decrease acetylcholinesterase (AChE) levels, reduce oxidative stress in the worms, lower lipid content, and to provide protection against chemically induced cholinergic neurodegeneration. Overall, the multifunctional effects of these hybrids qualify them as potential drug leads for further development in AD therapy.
