36204652|t|Therapeutic prospects of ceRNAs in COVID-19.
36204652|a|Since the end of 2019, COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 has spread worldwide, and the understanding of the new coronavirus is in a preliminary stage. Currently, immunotherapy, cell therapy, antiviral therapy, and Chinese herbal medicine have been applied in the clinical treatment of the new coronavirus; however, more efficient and safe drugs to control the progress of the new coronavirus are needed. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs), and circular RNAs (circRNAs) may provide new therapeutic targets for novel coronavirus treatments. The first aim of this paper is to review research progress on COVID-19 in the respiratory, immune, digestive, circulatory, urinary, reproductive, and nervous systems. The second aim is to review the body systems and potential therapeutic targets of lncRNAs, miRNAs, and circRNAs in patients with COVID-19. The current research on competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) (lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA and circRNA-miRNA-mRNA) in SARS-CoV-2 is summarized. Finally, we predict the possible therapeutic targets of four lncRNAs, MALAT1, NEAT1, TUG1, and GAS5, in COVID-19. Importantly, the role of PTEN gene in the ceRNA network predicted by lncRNA MALAT1 and lncRNA TUG1 may help in the discovery and clinical treatment of effective drugs for COVID-19.
