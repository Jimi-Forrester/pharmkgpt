38785991|a|Posiphen is a small molecule that exhibits neuroprotective properties by targeting multiple neurotoxic proteins involved in axonal transport, synaptic transmission, neuroinflammation, and cell death. Its broad-spectrum effects make it a promising candidate for treating neurodegenerative conditions, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Despite extensive investigation with animal models and human subjects, a comprehensive comparative analysis of Posiphen's pharmacokinetics across studies remains elusive. Here, we address this gap by examining the metabolic profiles of Posiphen and its breakdown into two primary metabolites-N1 and N8-across species by measuring their concentrations in plasma, brain, and CSF using the LC-MS/MS method. While all three compounds effectively inhibit neurotoxic proteins, the N1 metabolite is associated with adverse effects. Our findings reveal the species-specific behavior of Posiphen, with both Posiphen and N8 being predominant in various species, while N1 remains a minor constituent, supporting the drug's safety. Moreover, in plasma, Posiphen consistently showed fast clearance of all metabolites within 8 h in animal models and in human subjects, whereas in CSF or brain, the compound has an extended half-life of over 12 h. Combining all our human data and analyzing them by population pharmacokinetics showed that there are no differences between healthy volunteers, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's patients. It also showed that Posiphen is absorbed and metabolized in a similar fashion across all animal species and human groups tested. These observations have critical implications for understanding the drug's safety, therapeutic effect, and clinical translation.
