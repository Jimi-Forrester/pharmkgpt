39087644|a|Rectifying the aberrant microenvironment of a disease through maintenance of redox homeostasis has emerged as a promising perspective with significant therapeutic potential for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Herein, we design and construct a novel nanozyme-boosted MOF-CRISPR platform (CMOPKP), which can maintain redox homeostasis and rescue the impaired microenvironment of AD. By modifying the targeted peptides KLVFFAED, CMOPKP can traverse the blood-brain barrier and deliver the CRISPR activation system for precise activation of the Nrf2 signaling pathway and downstream redox proteins in regions characterized by oxidative stress, thereby reinstating neuronal antioxidant capacity and preserving redox homeostasis. Furthermore, cerium dioxide possessing catalase enzyme-like activity can synergistically alleviate oxidative stress. Further in vivo studies demonstrate that CMOPKP can effectively alleviate cognitive impairment in 3xTg-AD mouse models. Therefore, our design presents an effective way for regulating redox homeostasis in AD, which shows promise as a therapeutic strategy for mitigating oxidative stress in AD.
