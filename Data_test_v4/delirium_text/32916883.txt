32916883|t|The Landscape of CAR-T Cell Clinical Trials against Solid Tumors-A Comprehensive Overview.
32916883|a|CAR-T cells showed great potential in the treatment of patients with hematologic tumors. However, the clinical efficacy of CAR-T cells against solid tumors lags behind. To obtain a comprehensive overview of the landscape of CAR-T cell clinical trials against this type of cancer, this review summarizes all the 196 studies registered at clinicaltrials.gov. Special focus is on: (1) geographical distribution; (2) targeted organs, tumor entities, and antigens; (3) CAR transfer methods, CAR formats, and extra features introduced into the T cells; and (4) patient pretreatments, injection sites, and safety measurements. Finally, the few data on clinical outcome are reported. The last assessment of clinicaltrials.gov for the data summarized in this paper was on 4 August 2020.
