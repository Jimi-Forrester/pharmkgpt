39691426|a|Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a common disease with a high rate of death and disability, which poses a serious threat to human health; thus, the effective treatment of TBI has been a high priority. The brain-gut-microbial (BGM) axis, as a bidirectional communication network for information exchange between the brain and gut, plays a crucial role in neurological diseases. This article comprehensively explores the interrelationship between the BGM axis and TBI, including its physiological effects, basic pathophysiology, and potential therapeutic strategies. It highlights how the bidirectional regulatory pathways of the BGM axis could provide new insights into clinical TBI treatment and underscores the necessity for advanced research and development of innovative clinical treatments for TBI.
