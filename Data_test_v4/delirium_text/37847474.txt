37847474|a|METHODS: Patients undergoing elective laparoscopic radical resection of colorectal cancer from July 2019 to May 2021 were selected. The patients were assigned to Ai-PCIA group and control group. Ai-PCIA group received postoperative analgesia management and effect evaluation through intelligent wireless analgesia system + postoperative follow-up twice a day, while control group received analgesia management and effect evaluation through ward physician feedback + postoperative follow-up twice a day. The pain numerical score (NRS), Richards-Campbell Sleep Scale (RCSQ), and adverse outcomes were collected and compared. RESULTS: A total of 60 patients (20 females and 40 males with average (78.26 +- 6.42) years old) were included. The NRS scores at rest and during activity of the Ai-PCA group at 8, 12, and 24 h after the operation were significantly lower than that of the control group (all P < 0.05). The RCSQ score of Ai-PCA group was significantly higher than that of control group on the 1st and 2nd days after operation (all P < 0.05). There were no significant differences in the incidence of dizziness and nausea, vomiting, and myocardial ischemia (all P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Ai-PCIA can improve the analgesic effect and sleep quality of older patients after laparoscopic radical resection, which may be promoted in clinical analgesia practice.
