38542534|a|Obesity has been increasing worldwide and is well-known as a risk factor for cognitive decline. It has been reported that oxidative stress in the brain is deeply involved in cognitive dysfunction in rodent models. While there are many studies on oxidation in the liver and adipose tissue of obese mice, the relationship between obesity-induced cognitive dysfunction and brain oxidation has not been elucidated. Here, we show that obesity induced by a high-fat, high-sucrose diet (HFSD) alters cognitive function in C57BL/6 male mice, and it may involve the acceleration of brain oxidation. Tocotrienols (T3s), which are members of the vitamin E family, can prevent HFSD-induced cognitive changes. To elucidate these mechanisms, respiratory metabolism, locomotor activity, temperature around brown adipose tissue, and protein profiles in the cerebrum cortex were measured. Contrary to our expectation, respiratory metabolism was decreased, and temperature around brown adipose tissue was increased in the feeding of HFSD. The proteins that regulate redox balance did not significantly change, but 12 proteins, which were changed by HFSD feeding and not changed by T3s-treated HFSD compared to control mice, were identified. Our results indicated that HFSD-induced obesity decreases mouse learning ability and that T3s prevent its change. Additionally, feeding of HFSD significantly increased brain oxidation. However, further study is needed to elucidate the mechanisms of change in oxidative stress in the brain by obesity.
