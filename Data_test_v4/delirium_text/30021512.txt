Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can secret neurotrophic factors and cytokines to protect from oxidative stress-related neuronal apoptosis. However, whether MSCs can protect from sevoflurane-induced neuronal apoptosis and the potential mechanisms are unclear. METHODS: A non-contact co-culture of MSCs with human neuroglioma H4 cells (H4 cells) was built. H4 cells were co-cultured with MSCs or without MSCs (control) for 24 h. The co-cultured H4 cells were exposed to 4% sevoflurane for 6 h. The levels of caspase-3, reactive oxygen species (ROS), adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and the release of cytochrome C were determined by Western blot and fluorescence assay. RESULTS: Sevoflurane exposure significantly elevated the levels of cleaved caspase 3 and Bax in H4 cells. However, these phenomena were significantly offset by the co-culture with MSCs in H4 cells. Co-culture with MSCs before, but not after, sevoflurane exposure, significantly attenuated sevoflurane-induced ROS production in H4 cells. MSCs prevented sevoflurane-mediated release of cytochrome C from the mitochondria and production of ATP in H4 cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicated that soluble factors secreted by MSCs attenuated the sevoflurane-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis of neuronal cells by preserving their mitochondrial function.
