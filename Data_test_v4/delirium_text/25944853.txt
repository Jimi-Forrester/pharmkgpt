25944853|t|Cerebroprotective effects of RAS inhibitors: Beyond their cardio-renal actions.
25944853|a|Work on the brain renin-angiotensin system has been explored by various researchers and has led to elucidation of its basic physiologies and behavior, including its role in reabsorption and uptake of body fluid, blood pressure maintenance with angiotensin II being its prominent effector. Currently, this system has been implicated for its newly established effects, which are far beyond its cardio-renal effects accounting for maintenance of cerebral blood flow and cerebroprotection, seizure, in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and bipolar disorder. In this review, we have discussed the distribution of angiotensin receptor subtypes in the central nervous system (CNS) together with enzymatic pathways leading to active angiotensin ligands and its interaction with angiotensin receptor 2 (AT2) and Mas receptors. Secondly, the use of angiotensin analogues (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and AT1 and/or AT2 receptor blockers) in the treatment and management of the CNS disorders mentioned above has been discussed.
