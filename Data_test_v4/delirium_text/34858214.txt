34858214|t|Virchow's Triad and the Role of Thrombosis in COVID-Related Stroke.
34858214|a|In December 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was identified as a virally transmitted disease. Three months later, SARS-CoV-2 became one of the largest pandemics in recent times, causing more than 235 million cases globally, and accounting for at least 4.8 million deaths to date. SARS-COV-2 infection was initially classified as a respiratory tract infection, but later was recognized as a multisystemic disease compromising gastrointestinal, hematological, cardiac, and neurological systems. With this Review, we aim to describe the epidemiology, risk factors, mechanisms, and management of cerebrovascular events in patients infected with COVID-19. Neurological manifestations related to thromboembolic cerebrovascular events in patients infected with COVID-19 have been frequent and associated with poor prognosis in the majority of cases. A better understanding of the mechanisms of thrombosis and etiologies of this new disease process are necessary to determine how to prevent and treat patients to reduce their length of stay, morbidity, and mortality.
