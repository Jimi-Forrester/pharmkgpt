23515184|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive and fatal neurodegenerative disorder marked by memory impairment and cognitive deficits. A major component of AD pathology is the accumulation of amyloid plaques in the brain, which are comprised of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides derived from the amyloidogenic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (AbetaPP) by beta- and gamma-secretases. In a subset of patients, inheritance of mutations in the AbetaPP gene is responsible for altering Abeta production, leading to early onset disease. Interestingly, many of these familial mutations lie within the transmembrane domain of the protein near the GxxxG and GxxxA dimerization motifs that are important for transmembrane interactions. As AbetaPP dimerization has been linked to changes in Abeta production, it is of interest to know whether familial AbetaPP mutations affect full-length APP dimerization. Using bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC), blue native gel electrophoresis, and live cell chemical cross-linking, we found that familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) mutations do not affect full-length AbetaPP dimerization in transfected HEK293 and COS7 cells. It follows that changes in AbetaPP dimerization are not necessary for altered Abeta production, and in FAD mutations, changes in Abeta levels are more likely a result of alternative proteolytic processing.
