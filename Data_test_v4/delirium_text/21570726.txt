21570726|a|A self-administered cognitive test (Test Your Memory, TYM) is designed as a screening test for the detection of Alzheimer disease (AD). We compared the diagnostic utility of the Japanese version of the TYM (TYM-J) in AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) with that of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale Japanese version (ADAS-Jcog). We studied 79 patients with mild AD, 46 with MCI and 34 normal controls. The sensitivity and specificity of each test in the diagnosis of AD and MCI were compared. The average total TYM-J scores were 45.7 in controls, 41.7 in MCI, and 35.7 in AD. The TYM-J scores showed good correlations with other neuropsychological tests. The receiver operating characteristic analysis demonstrated that the TYM-J could better discriminate AD from controls and MCI from controls than the other tests. With each optimal cut-off score of the TYM-J, the sensitivity and specificity were 96% and 91% for diagnosing AD, and 76% and 74% for diagnosing MCI, respectively. The TYM-J is useful for the diagnosis of AD and MCI, and can be applied as a screening test in a Japanese memory clinic.
