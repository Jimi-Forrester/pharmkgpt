39483205|a|Introduction: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline, memory loss, and impaired daily functioning. Despite significant research, AD remains incurable, highlighting the critical need for early diagnosis and intervention to improve patient outcomes. Timely detection plays a crucial role in managing the disease more effectively. Pretrained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on large-scale datasets, such as ImageNet, have been employed for AD classification, providing a head start for developing more accurate models. Methods: This paper proposes a novel hybrid deep learning approach that combines the strengths of two specific pretrained architectures. The proposed model enhances the representation of AD-related patterns by leveraging the feature extraction capabilities of both networks. We validated this model using a large dataset of MRI images from AD patients. Performance was evaluated in terms of classification accuracy and robustness against noise, and the results were compared to several commonly used models in AD detection. Results: The proposed hybrid model demonstrated significant performance improvements over individual models, achieving an accuracy classification rate of 99.85%. Comparative analysis with other models further revealed the superiority of the new architecture, particularly in terms of classification rate and resistance to noise interference. Discussion: The high accuracy and robustness of the proposed hybrid model suggest its potential utility in early AD detection. By improving feature representation through the combination of two pretrained networks, this model could provide clinicians with a more reliable tool for early diagnosis and monitoring of AD progression. This approach holds promise for aiding in timely diagnoses and treatment decisions, contributing to better management of Alzheimer's disease.
