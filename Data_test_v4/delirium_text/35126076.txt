35126076|t|Differential Tractography and Correlation Tractography Findings on Patients With Mild Traumatic Brain Injury: A Pilot Study.
35126076|a|Differential tractography and correlation tractography are new tractography modalities to study neuronal changes in brain diseases, but their performances in detecting neuronal injuries are yet to be investigated in patients with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). Here we investigated the white matter injury in mTBI patients using differential and correlation tractography. The diffusion MRI was acquired at 33 mTBI patients and 31 health controls. 7 of the mTBI patients had one-year follow-up scans, and differential tractography was used to evaluate injured fiber bundles on these 7 patients. All subjects were evaluated using digital symbol substitution test (DSST) and trail making test A (TMT-A), and the correlation tractography was performed to explore the exact pathways related to the cognitive performance. Our results showed that differential tractography revealed neuronal changes in the corpus callosum in all 7 follow-up mTBI patients with FDR between 0.007 and 0.17. Further, the correlation tractography showed that the splenium of the corpus callosum, combined with the right superior longitudinal fasciculus and right cingulum, were correlated with DSST (FDR = 0.001669) in the acute mTBI patients. The cognitive impairment findings in the acute stage and the longitudinal findings in the corpus callosum in the chronic stage of mTBI patients suggest that differential tractography and correlation tractography are valuable tools in the diagnostic and prognostic evaluation of neuronal injuries in mTBI patients.
