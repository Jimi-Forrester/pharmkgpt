37836436|t|Anthocyanins as Immunomodulatory Dietary Supplements: A Nutraceutical Perspective and Micro-/Nano-Strategies for Enhanced Bioavailability.
37836436|a|Anthocyanins (ACNs) have attracted considerable attention for their potential to modulate the immune system. Research has revealed their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, which play a crucial role in immune regulation by influencing key immune cells, such as lymphocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells. Moreover, ACNs contribute towards maintaining a balance between proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines, thus promoting immune health. Beyond their direct effects on immune cells, ACNs significantly impact gut health and the microbiota, essential factors in immune regulation. Emerging evidence suggests that they positively influence the composition of the gut microbiome, enhancing their immunomodulatory effects. Furthermore, these compounds synergize with other bioactive substances, such as vitamins and minerals, further enhancing their potential as immune-supporting dietary supplements. However, detailed clinical studies must fully validate these findings and determine safe dosages across varied populations. Incorporating these natural compounds into functional foods or supplements could revolutionize the management of immune-related conditions. Personalized nutrition and healthcare strategies may be developed to enhance overall well-being and immune resilience by fully understanding the mechanisms underlying the actions of their components. Recent advancements in delivery methods have focused on improving the bioavailability and effectiveness of ACNs, providing promising avenues for future applications.
