36694268|a|Of the proteinaceous beta-sheet-rich amyloid fibrillar structures, the Abeta25-35 peptide, a component of the full-length Abeta involved in Alzheimer's disease, has similar toxicity to the parent peptide. In this study, the effects of homocysteine thiolactone (HCTL) and hydrogen peroxide (H2 O2 ) on the conformation and fibrillation propensity of the Abeta25-35 peptide were investigated. Both HCTL and H2 O2 induced amino acid modifications along with alteration in aggregation propensity. Methionine (Met)-35 was oxidized by H2 O2 and aggregation was attenuated following the increased hydrophilicity of the peptide due to sulfoxide/sulfone formation. The HCTL-modified lysine (Lys-28) residue destabilizes the structure of the peptide, which leads to fibrillation. Our studies provide important information regarding the relationship between amino acid modifications and the amyloid fibrillation process.
