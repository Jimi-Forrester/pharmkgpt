30074132|a|Cerebral blood flow (CBF) is uniquely regulated by the anatomical design of the cerebral vasculature as well as through neurovascular coupling. The process of directing the CBF to meet the energy demands of neuronal activity is referred to as neurovascular coupling. Microvasculature in the brain constitutes the critical component of the neurovascular coupling. Mitochondria provide the majority of ATP to meet the high-energy demand of the brain. Impairment of mitochondrial function plays a central role in several age-related diseases such as hypertension, ischemic brain injury, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson disease. Interestingly, microvessels and small arteries of the brain have been the focus of the studies implicating the vascular mechanisms in several age-related neurological diseases. However, the role of microvascular mitochondrial dysfunction in age-related diseases remains unexplored. To date, high-throughput assay for measuring mitochondrial respiration in microvessels is lacking. The current study presents a novel method to measure mitochondrial respiratory parameters in freshly isolated microvessels from mouse brain ex vivo using Seahorse XFe24 Analyzer. We validated the method by demonstrating impairments of mitochondrial respiration in cerebral microvessels isolated from old mice compared to the young mice. Thus, application of mitochondrial respiration studies in microvessels will help identify novel vascular mechanisms underlying a variety of age-related neurological diseases.
