39348852|t|Altered Mental Status and Delirium in Pediatric Patients.
39348852|a|Mental status is the collection of an individual's consciousness, perception, emotion, memory, and cognition at a particular point in time, which is inferred by the clinician through careful observation and interaction. The pediatric mental status assessment must be approached with an understanding of cognitive, language, and psychosocial development. Alterations must then be comprehensively and clearly described. Delirium is a phenotypic diagnosis with a specific set of criteria in the DSM and is a serious neurocognitive disorder caused by physiologic changes due to illness, injury, toxins, medications, and/or substances. Recognition of delirium in children is improved by monitoring of predisposing risks and precipitating factors, as well as the regular use of validated pediatric screening tools. Management of delirium is focused on treatment of the underlying etiology, prevention of iatrogenic deliriogenic factors, and patient safety.
