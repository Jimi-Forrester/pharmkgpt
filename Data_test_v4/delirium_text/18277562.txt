18277562|a|BACKGROUND: We studied the prevalence of postoperative complications and the predictor for the occurrence of postoperative delirium in patients who had received surgery for femoral neck fracture. METHODS: A retrospective study, covering the period between January 1, 2005 and March 31, 2006, was carried out 50 in patients of advanced age treated for femoral neck fracture. We investigated main symptoms of postoperative complications. We also compared postoperative delirium group (D group) with no delirium group (ND group). RESULTS: The following results were obtained. Main postoperative complications were delirium, hypotension and hypoxia. And only one death case was included. In postoperative delirium, there was not a wide difference between the two groups except for hearing loss. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that it might be possible to prevent postoperative complications by careful perioperative management. Hearing loss preoperatively was a risk factor of postoperative delirium in advanced elderly patients.
