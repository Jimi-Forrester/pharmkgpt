8122469|t|[The productive psychopathological symptoms and cerebral blood flow in organic brain lesions].
8122469|a|The study was made of correlations arising between psychopathological symptoms (PPS) observed in organic brain lesions in acute posttraumatic, postoperative and posthemorrhagic periods in 111 patients with objective data on cerebral circulation and cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR). PPS included mental conditions of delirium type: of classical form (106 cases), of atypical forms (5 cases). In PPS there appeared a tendency to an increase in the values of cerebral circulation and CVR. PPS patterns and regions of elevated CVR were found related. Long-term persistence of PPS in the acute disease eventuated into a reduction of psychic functions and total and regional hemodynamics. In atypical delirium against preexisting encephalopathy the trend to hyperreactivity of the brain vessels disappeared during a short period.
