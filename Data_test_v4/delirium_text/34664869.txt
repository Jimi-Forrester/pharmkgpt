34664869|t|Investigation of blood leptin and adropin levels in patients with multiple sclerosis: A CONSORT-clinical study.
34664869|a|BACKGROUND: The effects of adipokines have been investigated in multiple sclerosis (MS) in the literature. Results are uncertain, and subgroups like adropin have not been previously studied. We primarily aimed to determine leptin and adropin levels in MS and their potential use as a biomarker. METHODS: This study was an experimental research. While 44 MS patients diagnosed according to McDonald criteria were included in the patient group, 40 people without MS diagnosis and risk factors took part in the control group. Demographic data, height, weight, body mass index, blood glucose, thyroid-stimulating hormone, alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, creatinine, low-density lipoprotein, leptin, adropin levels, presence of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease were recorded. Expanded disability status scale and disease duration were also evaluated in the patient group. Our data were presented as mean +- standard deviations. RESULTS: The mean blood leptin value of the patient group (6.12 +- 5.34 ng/mL) was significantly lower than the value of the control group (13.02 +- 8.25 ng/mL) (P < .001). The patient group had a mean adropin level of 504.12 +- 311.17 ng/mL, which was significantly lower than that of the control group (747.0 +- 309.42 ng/mL) (P < .001). Statistically insignificant differences were found between their body mass index, glucose, alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, thyroid-stimulating hormone, low-density lipoprotein levels (P > .001). CONCLUSION: This is the first study that has evaluated adropin levels in patients with MS. The relationship between MS and leptin levels is still unclear. Therefore, our study might be helpful to elucidate MS pathogenesis and provide supportive criteria for diagnosis.
