30309280|t|Pharmacologic Management of Delirium in the ICU: A Review of the Literature.
30309280|a|PURPOSE: Conflicting data exists on the pharmacologic management of intensive care unit (ICU) delirium. This review appraises the current evidence of pharmacologic management of ICU delirium. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic literature search of MEDLINE and Embase was conducted to answer the population, intervention, comparison, and outcome (PICO) question of: "Does the use of a pharmacologic agent compared to standard of care or placebo improve ICU delirium in a critically ill patient population?" RESULTS: After application of the PICO question and the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 13 articles were included. Of these articles, 7 were prospective randomized controlled trials, 1 was a prospective nonrandomized controlled trial, and 5 were retrospective investigations. The included articles differed in the agents evaluated, primary outcome, and method of identifying delirium. CONCLUSION: The variability of outcomes illustrates the need for a large-scale investigation to further evaluate the role of pharmacologic management of ICU delirium.
