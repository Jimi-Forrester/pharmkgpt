30689563|a|The degeneration in the locus coeruleus associated with Alzheimer's disease suggests an involvement of the noradrenergic system in the disease pathogenesis. The role of depleted norepinephrine was tested in adult and aged rhesus macaques to develop a potential model for testing Alzheimer's disease interventions. Monkeys were injected with the noradrenergic neurotoxin N-(2-chloroethyl)-N-ethyl-2-bromobenzylamine (DSP4) or vehicle at 0, 3, and 6 months; brains were harvested at 9 months. Reduced norepinephrine in the locus coeruleus was accompanied by decreased dopamine beta-hydroxylase staining and increased amyloid-beta load in the aged group, and the proportion of potentially toxic amyloid-beta42 peptide was increased. Immunohistochemistry revealed no effects on microglia or astrocytes. DSP4 treatment altered amyloid processing, but these changes were not associated with the induction of chronic neuroinflammation. These findings suggest norepinephrine deregulation is an essential component of a nonhuman primate model of Alzheimer's disease, but further refinement is necessary.
