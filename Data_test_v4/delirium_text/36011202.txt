36011202|a|Delirium is an important component of the geriatric syndromes and has been recognized to negatively influence the prognosis of older people in hospital and in a post-acute setting. About 2-5% of older people world-wide live in nursing homes and are characterized by functional impairment, cognitive decline, dementia, comorbidities, and polypharmacotherapy, all factors which influence the development of delirium. However, in this setting, delirium remains often understudied. Therefore, in this narrative review, we aimed to describe the latest evidence regarding delirium screening tools, epidemiology characteristics, outcomes, risk factors, and preventions strategies in nursing homes.
