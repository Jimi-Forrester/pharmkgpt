39322357|t|Focused Ultrasound for Neurodegenerative Diseases.
39322357|a|Neurodegenerative diseases are a leading cause of death and disability and pose a looming global public health crisis. Despite progress in understanding biological and molecular factors associated with these disorders and their progression, effective disease modifying treatments are presently limited. Focused ultrasound (FUS) is an emerging therapeutic strategy for Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In these contexts, applications of FUS include neuroablation, neuromodulation, and/or blood-brain barrier opening with and without facilitated intracerebral drug delivery. Here, the authors review preclinical evidence and current and emerging applications of FUS for neurodegenerative diseases and summarize future directions in the field.
