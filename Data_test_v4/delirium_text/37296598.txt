37296598|t|Cognitive Deficits in Aging Related to Changes in Basal Forebrain Neuronal Activity.
37296598|a|Aging is a physiological process accompanied by a decline in cognitive performance. The cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain provide projections to the cortex that are directly engaged in many cognitive processes in mammals. In addition, basal forebrain neurons contribute to the generation of different rhythms in the EEG along the sleep/wakefulness cycle. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of recent advances grouped around the changes in basal forebrain activity during healthy aging. Elucidating the underlying mechanisms of brain function and their decline is especially relevant in today's society as an increasingly aged population faces higher risks of developing neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. The profound age-related cognitive deficits and neurodegenerative diseases associated with basal forebrain dysfunction highlight the importance of investigating the aging of this brain region.
