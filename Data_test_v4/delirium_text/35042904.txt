35042904|a|Previous research has established links between chronic pain and impaired cognitive ability, as well as between chronic pain and anxiety, in osteoarthritis. Furthermore, there is evidence linking risk of osteoarthritis to lower educational attainment. However, the inter-play of these factors with key social factors (e.g., social deprivation) at the early stages of osteoarthritis are not understood. Here, we used data from waves 4, 5, 6 and 7 of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) (n = 971) and selected a subsample of respondents who initially did not report a diagnosis of osteoarthritis until wave 6. We used path models to test how social deprivation, education and anxiety, before diagnosis (waves 4 and 5), affect the relationship between cognitive ability, pain and limitations in activities of daily living following diagnosis (waves 6 and 7). We show that high social deprivation before diagnosis predicts greater limitations in activities of daily living after diagnosis, with this effect partly mediated by impaired cognitive ability. We also find that higher educational attainment before diagnosis may protect against limitations in activities of daily living after diagnosis via better cognitive ability and lower anxiety. Therefore, improving cognitive ability and managing anxiety may mitigate the associations of social deprivation and low educational attainment with limitations in activities of daily living.
