38597139|t|Periodontal Treatment During the Blanking Period Improves the Outcome of Atrial Fibrillation Ablation.
38597139|a|BACKGROUND: Periodontitis has not been recognized as a modifiable risk factor for atrial fibrillation (AF). This prospective nonrandomized study investigated whether periodontal treatment improves the AF ablation outcome. METHODS AND RESULTS: We prospectively enrolled 288 AF patients scheduled to undergo initial radiofrequency catheter ablation. Each patient underwent periodontal inflamed surface area (PISA; a quantitative index of periodontal inflammation) measurement. All eligible patients were recommended to receive periodontal treatment within the blanking period, and 97 consented. During the mean follow-up period of 507+-256 days, 70 (24%) AF recurrences were documented. Patients who exhibited AF recurrences had a higher PISA than those who did not (456.8+-403.5 versus 277.7+-259.0 mm2, P=0.001). These patients were categorized into high-PISA (>615 mm2) and low-PISA (<615 mm2) groups according to the receiver operating characteristic analysis for AF recurrence (area under the curve, 0.611; sensitivity, 39%; specificity, 89%). A high PISA, as well as female sex, AF duration, and left atrial volume, were the statistically significant predicter for AF recurrence (hazard ratio [HR], 2.308 [95% CI, 1.234-4.315]; P=0.009). In patients with a high PISA, those who underwent periodontal treatment showed significantly fewer AF recurrences (P=0.01, log-rank test). The adjusted HR of periodontal treatment for AF recurrence was 0.393 (95% CI, 0.215-0.719; P=0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Periodontitis may serve as a modifiable risk factor for AF. PISA is a hallmark of AF recurrence, and periodontal treatment improves the AF ablation outcome, especially for those with poor periodontal condition.
