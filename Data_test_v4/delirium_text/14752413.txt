14752413|t|Predictors of delirium after cardiac surgery delirium: effect of beating-heart (off-pump) surgery.
14752413|a|BACKGROUND: Despite improved outcomes after cardiac operations, postoperative delirium remains a common complication that is associated with increased morbidity and prolonged hospital stay. METHODS: Univariate and multivariate predictors of postoperative delirium were determined from prospectively gathered data on 16,184 patients undergoing cardiac operations with cardiopulmonary bypass (conventional, n = 14,342) and without cardiopulmonary bypass (beating-heart surgery, n = 1847) between April 1996 and August 2001. Delirium was defined as a transient mental syndrome of acute onset characterized by global impairment of cognitive functions, a reduced level of consciousness, attentional abnormalities, increased or decreased psychomotor activity, and a disordered sleep-wake cycle. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of postoperative delirium was 8.4%. Of 49 selected patient-related risk factors and treatment variables, 35 were highly associated with postoperative delirium by univariate analysis. Stepwise logistic regression revealed the following variables as independent predictors of delirium: history of cerebrovascular disease, peripheral vascular disease, atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus, left ventricular ejection fraction of 30% or less, preoperative cardiogenic shock, urgent operation, intraoperative hemofiltration, operation time of 3 hours or more, and a high perioperative transfusion requirement. Two variables were identified as having a significant protective effect against postoperative delirium: beating-heart surgery and younger patient age. CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative delirium is a common complication in cardiac operations. The increased use of beating-heart surgery without cardiopulmonary bypass may lead to a lower prevalence of this complication and thus improve patient outcomes.
