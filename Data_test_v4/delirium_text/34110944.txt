34110944|a|INTRODUCTION: Autophagy is a cellular catabolic mechanism that helps clear damaged cellular components and is essential for normal cellular and tissue function. The sigma-1 receptor (sigma-1R) is a chaperone protein involved in signal transduction, neurite outgrowth, and plasticity, improving memory, and neuroprotection. Recent evidence shows that sigma-1R can promote autophagy. Autophagy activation by the sigma-1Rs along with other neuroprotective effects makes it an interesting target for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. AF710B, T-817 MA, and ANAVEX2-73 are some of the sigma-1R agonists which have shown promising results and have entered clinical trials. These molecules have also been found to induce autophagy and show cytoprotective effects in cellular models. AREAS COVERED: This review provides insight into the current understanding of sigma-1R functions related to autophagy and their role in alleviating AD. EXPERT OPINION: We propose a mechanism through which the activation of sigma-1R and autophagy could alter amyloid precursor protein processing to inhibit amyloid-beta production by reconstituting cholesterol and gangliosides in the lipid raft to offer neuroprotection against AD. Future AD treatment could involve the combined targeting of the sigma-1R and autophagy activation. We suggest that future studies investigate the link between autophagy the sigma-1R and AD.
