35602824|t|The Impact of COVID-19 Infection on a Neurologically Compromised Male With Fahr's Disease Presenting With Acute Delirium and Aspiration Pneumonia: A Case Report.
35602824|a|Fahr's disease or idiopathic basal ganglia calcification is a rare, sporadic, genetically dominant, and inherited neurological condition that manifests with dysphagia and Parkinson's disease. The computed tomography (CT) scan is the method of choice to diagnose basal ganglia calcifications seen in Fahr's disease. This case report elaborates on the emergency management of a 58-year-old male patient with acute respiratory distress, acute delirium, schizophrenia, Fahr's syndrome, and history of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (coronavirus disease 2019 or COVID-19) infection. The patient's chest X-ray, laboratory workup, and vital signs were suggestive of aspiration pneumonia-induced sepsis and acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. Post-admission antibiotic management reduced sepsis complications without improving the altered mental status. A comprehensive clinical assessment suggested the attribution of Fahr's disease to the patient's aspiration pneumonia and other clinical complications. In addition, COVID-19 infection, sepsis-induced inflammatory processes, and pre-existing neurological compromise possibly deteriorated the patient's neurological outcomes, overall prognosis, and recovery.
