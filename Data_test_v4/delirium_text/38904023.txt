38904023|a|Abnormal proliferation of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) is one of the critical pathological mechanisms of pulmonary hypertension (PH), and therefore is gradually being adopted as an important direction for the treatment of PH. Metallothioneins (MTs) have been reported to be associated with PH, but the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Here, we demonstrated that the expression level of metallothionein 3 (MT3) was significantly increased in pulmonary arterioles from PH patients and chronic hypoxia-induced rat and mouse PH models, as well as in hypoxia-treated human PASMCs. Knockdown of MT3 significantly inhibited the proliferation of human PASMCs by arresting the cell cycle in the G1 phase, while overexpression of MT3 had the opposite effect. Mechanistically, we found that MT3 increased the intracellular zinc (Zn2+) concentration to enhance the transcriptional activity of metal-regulated transcription factor 1 (MTF1), which promoted the expression of autophagy-related gene 5 (ATG5), facilitating autophagosome formation. More importantly, MT3-induced autophagy and proliferation of human PASMCs were largely prevented by knockdown of MTF1 and ATG5. Therefore, in this study, we identified MT3-Zinc-MTF1-ATG5 as a novel pathway that affects PASMC proliferation by regulating autophagosome formation, suggesting that MT3 may be a novel target for the treatment of PH.
