39058990|a|BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD) progresses at highly variable rates in different individuals but, in general, has a fairly stable rate of progression in each patient. In cases where the decline in cognition and behavior suddenly accelerates, we usually think of co-existent Alzheimer pathology, as most demented PD patients also have Alzheimer disease (AD) changes, although not necessarily meeting criteria for a distinct pathological diagnosis of AD. METHODS: Clinico-pathological case Results: A 75-year-old woman presented with a typical PD course including a good response to L-Dopa. Four years after diagnosis she developed a rapid decline in motor symptoms, severe cognitive fluctuations, and rapidly progressive dementia, dying within one year of the onset of the rapid progression. CONCLUSIONS: While most cases of Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) show concomitant Alzheimer's pathology, the sudden acceleration of the disease does not necessarily indicate the presence of concomitant Alzheimer's disease.
