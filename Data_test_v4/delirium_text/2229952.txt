2229952|t|Predictors of institutionalization among Alzheimer disease victims with caregiving spouses.
2229952|a|A theoretical model predicting "desire to institutionalize" and actual institutionalization was developed and tested on a sample of 220 persons caring for a demented spouse. Significant predictors of "desire to institutionalize" include age and education of caregiver, spouse's forgetful behaviors, ADL tasks done by the caregiver, medications taken by the caregiver, services used, and quality of relationship with spouse. Predictors of actual institutionalization are desire to institutionalize, length of time spent as a caregiver, religion, uplifts, and forgetful behaviors of the impaired spouse.
