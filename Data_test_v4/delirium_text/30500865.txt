30500865|t|A cross-sectional study of national outpatient gastric acid suppressant prescribing in the United States between 2009 and 2015.
30500865|a|PURPOSE: Gastric acid suppressants are commonly used in the United States, and while generally well-tolerated, long-term use has been associated with infection, bone fractures, and nutrient malabsorption. The purpose of this study was to describe national trends in gastric acid suppressant use over a 7-year period. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study using data from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey from 2009 to 2015. Gastric acid suppressant use was defined as any outpatient visit with a documented prescription for a proton pump inhibitor or histamine-2 receptor antagonist documented during the outpatient visit. Sample data weights were used to extrapolate to national estimates. Use was calculated as the number of prescriptions per total outpatient visits per year. Appropriateness of prescribing was assessed using FDA-approved indications listed in each visit. RESULTS: These data represent 6.8 billion patient outpatient visits between 2009 and 2015, of which nearly 600 million (8.8%) had documented gastric acid suppressant use. The median (IQR) age of gastric acid suppressant users and non-gastric acid suppressant users was 62 (50-73) and 49 (25-65), respectively. Gastric acid suppressant use decreased from 9.0% in 2009 to 7.7% in 2012, and then increased to 9.7% in 2015. Proton pump inhibitor use was slightly higher in the Midwest (8.3%). Only 15.8% of gastric acid suppressant users had a documented indication. CONCLUSIONS: Proton pump inhibitor use increased after 2012, and the majority of gastric acid suppressant users did not have a documented indication. Judicious gastric acid suppressant prescribing needs to be exercised, especially in the context of new safety data regarding long-term proton pump inhibitor use.
