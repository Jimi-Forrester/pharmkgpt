9486483|a|The alpha-antichymotrypsin (ACT) and the ApoE polymorphisms have been determined in 136 Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and in 92 age-matched controls. Only a borderline significant difference is found when comparing the overall ACT/AA genotype frequency between AD patients and controls (chi2, P = 0.08). However this difference is attributable entirely and significantly to the ApoE epsilon4 non-carrier AD group (chi2, P = 0.004). No differences are found in the ACT/AA genotype frequency of the ApoE epsilon4 AD carrier group as compared controls (chi2, P = 0.98) in contrast with previous works. These findings support that the presence of the ACT/AA genotype is a genetic risk factor for developing AD in non-ApoE epsilon4 carriers subjects in our population.
