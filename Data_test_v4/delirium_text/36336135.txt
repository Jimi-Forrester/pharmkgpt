36336135|a|Four new terpenoids, solanoids F - I (1-4), together with eleven known compounds (5-15), were isolated from the whole herb of Solanum lyratum. The chemical structures were characterized by spectroscopic techniques, and electronic circular dichroism (ECD) data analysis was adopted to confirm the absolute configurations of 1-4. Compounds 1-6, 8 and 12-15 exhibited neuroprotective effects against H2O2-induced oxidative damage of human SH-SY5Y cells. Additionally, this study also combined Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses to explore the potential targets and signaling pathways of active terpenoids components in intervening Alzheimer's disease (AD).
