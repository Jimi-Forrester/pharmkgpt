37131407|a|Aims: Coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 particles are spherical and have proteins called spikes that stick out on the surface. COVID-19 most commonly affects the respiratory system, but various clinical manifestations on coronavirus have revealed their potential neurotropism. The neuroinvasive affinity of Coronavirus infections has been reported nearly for all the beta Coronavirus infections, including MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, HCoV-OC43 and HEV. Coronavirus invasion occurs through hypoxia injury, immune injury, ACE2, and direct infection. The pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 and other human Coronaviruses reveals the possible mechanisms of neurodegeneration. Methods: A systematic literature review carried out from various search engines like Scopus, PubMed, Medline, and Elsevier for investigating the therapeutic perspective of association between Covid-19 and Guillain-Barre syndrome. Results: SARS-CoV-2 uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 as its entry receptor and enters the central nervous system through a Blood-brain barrier constituted of inflammatory mediators, direct infection of the endothelial cells, or endothelial injury. Guillain-Barre syndrome is an autoimmune disease that injures and attacks the nerves in the peripheral nervous system. Studies suggest that the virus can infect peripheral neurons to cause direct damage through various mechanisms, including direct damage by cytokine-related injury, ACE2 receptors, and the sequelae of hypoxia. Conclusion: we have discussed the possible mechanisms between neuroinvasion of SARs-cov2 and Guillain-barre syndrome.
