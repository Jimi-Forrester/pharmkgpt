35054894|t|Disruption of Circadian Rhythm Genes in Obstructive Sleep Apnea Patients-Possible Mechanisms Involved and Clinical Implication.
35054894|a|Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a chronic condition characterized by recurrent pauses in breathing caused by the collapse of the upper airways, which results in intermittent hypoxia and arousals during the night. The disorder is associated with a vast number of comorbidities affecting different systems, including cardiovascular, metabolic, psychiatric, and neurological complications. Due to abnormal sleep architecture, OSA patients are at high risk of circadian clock disruption, as has been reported in several recent studies. The circadian clock affects almost all daily behavioral patterns, as well as a plethora of physiological processes, and might be one of the key factors contributing to OSA complications. An intricate interaction between the circadian clock and hypoxia may further affect these processes, which has a strong foundation on the molecular level. Recent studies revealed an interaction between hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1), a key regulator of oxygen metabolism, and elements of circadian clocks. This relationship has a strong base in the structure of involved elements, as HIF-1 as well as PER, CLOCK, and BMAL, belong to the same Per-Arnt-Sim domain family. Therefore, this review summarizes the available knowledge on the molecular mechanism of circadian clock disruption and its influence on the development and progression of OSA comorbidities.
