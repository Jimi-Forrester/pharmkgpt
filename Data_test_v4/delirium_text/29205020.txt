29205020|a|Neurons are more susceptible than other cells to the effects of ageing, since most of them are not capable of dividing, and they consume plenty of energy. In the "genetic code of brain ageing", central role is played by the genes that regulate the risk of Alzheimer's disease and vascular diseases. Genes have been recognized underlying memory disorders and longevity. Genetic studies have revealed metabolic routes, including fat and energy metabolism, that can be influenced by an individual through living habits, and also through structures maintaining social activity.
