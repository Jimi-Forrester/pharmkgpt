26612740|t|Outcomes of dexmedetomidine treatment in pediatric patients undergoing congenital heart disease surgery: a meta-analysis.
26612740|a|BACKGROUND: Dexmedetomidine decreases cardiac complications in adults undergoing cardiovascular surgery. This systematic review assessed whether perioperative dexmedetomidine improves congenital heart disease (CHD) surgery outcomes in children. METHODS: The PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or observational studies that were published until 16 April 2015 and compared dexmedetomidine with placebo or an alternative anesthetic agent during pediatric CHD surgery. The assessed outcomes included hemodynamics, ventilation length, intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital stays, blood glucose and serum cortisol levels, postoperative analgesia requirements, and postoperative delirium. RESULTS: Five RCTs and nine observational studies involving 2229 patients were included. In pooled analyses, dexmedetomidine was associated with shorter length of mechanical ventilation (mean difference: -93.36, 95% CI: -137.45, -49.27), lower postoperative fentanyl (mean difference: -24.11, 95% CI: -36.98, -11.24) and morphine (mean difference: -0.07, 95% CI: -0.14, 0.00) requirements, reduced stress response (i.e., lower blood glucose and serum cortisol levels), and lower risk of delirium (OR: 0.39, 95% CI: 0.21, 0.74). The hemodynamics of dexmedetomidine-treated patients appeared more stable, but there were no significant differences in the ICU or hospital stay durations. Dexmedetomidine may increase the bradycardia and hypotension risk (OR: 3.14, 95% CI: 1.47, 6.69). CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence indicates that dexmedetomidine improves outcomes in children undergoing CHD surgery. However, this finding largely relies on data from observational studies; high-quality RCTs are warranted because of the potential for subject selection bias.
