35537119|t|Multifunctional molecules with a bipyridyl core ameliorate multifaceted amyloid toxicity.
35537119|a|A series of 2,2'-bipyridine derivatives appended with structurally unique biomolecular auxiliaries were synthesized and investigated for their ability to ameliorate multifaceted amyloid toxicity. Our results highlight the roles of the metal-chelating bipyridine core and functional auxiliaries in effectively modulating metal-independent and -dependent amyloid toxicity, and oxidative stress observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD).
