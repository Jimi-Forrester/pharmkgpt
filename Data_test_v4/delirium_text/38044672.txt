38044672|a|A high level of beta-amyloid (Abeta) in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) generates reactive oxygen species that induce neuronal death and DNA damage. The interaction between the gut microbiota and brain health has attracted attention in recent years. Heat-killed Ruminococcus albus (hkRA) reportedly protects neurons against damage induced by oxidative stress. However, whether hkRA can inhibit Abeta-induced apoptosis and thus alleviate AD remains unclear. Hence, we aimed to evaluate the protective effects of hkRA against Abeta-induced apoptosis on the human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell. HkRA treatment (108 cells/ml) significantly decreased the Abeta-induced cytotoxicity and DNA damage in the SH-SY5Y cells. It also showed a significant increase of the bax/ bcl-2 ratio in the Abeta-treated SH-SY5Y cells. Moreover, hkRA treatment stimulated the expression of antioxidation-related genes HO-1, Nrf2, and PKC-delta and increased the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Meanwhile, it significantly decreased the activity of caspase-3 and protein expression of cleaved caspase-3 in the Abeta-treated SH-SY5Y cells. Additionally, the protein levels of mitochondrial and cytosolic cytochrome c increased and decreased, respectively, in the cells. These results suggest that hkRA protects human neuroblastoma cells from Abeta-induced apoptosis and oxidative stress. Thus, hkRA may be developed into a health-promoting paraprobiotic (the inactivated microbial cells of probiotics) for patients with AD.
