37449601|a|Advances in experimental and computational technologies continue to grow rapidly to provide novel avenues for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders. Despite this, there remain only a handful of drugs that have shown success in late-stage clinical trials for Tau-associated neurodegenerative disorders. The most commonly prescribed treatments are symptomatic treatments such as cholinesterase inhibitors and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor blockers that were approved for use in Alzheimer's disease. As diagnostic screening can detect disorders at earlier time points, the field needs pre-symptomatic treatments that can prevent, or significantly delay the progression of these disorders (Koychev et al., 2019). These approaches may be different from late-stage treatments that may help to ameliorate symptoms and slow progression once symptoms have become more advanced should early diagnostic screening fail. This mini-review will highlight five key avenues of academic and industrial research for identifying therapeutic strategies to treat Tau-associated neurodegenerative disorders. These avenues include investigating (1) the broad class of chemicals termed "small molecules"; (2) adaptive immunity through both passive and active antibody treatments; (3) innate immunity with an emphasis on microglial modulation; (4) synaptic compartments with the view that Tau-associated neurodegenerative disorders are synaptopathies. Although this mini-review will focus on Alzheimer's disease due to its prevalence, it will also argue the need to target other tauopathies, as through understanding Alzheimer's disease as a Tau-associated neurodegenerative disorder, we may be able to generalize treatment options. For this reason, added detail linking back specifically to Tau protein as a direct therapeutic target will be added to each topic.
