39057793|t|Advanced Protocol for Molecular Characterization of Viral Genome in Fission Yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe).
39057793|a|Fission yeast, a single-cell eukaryotic organism, shares many fundamental cellular processes with higher eukaryotes, including gene transcription and regulation, cell cycle regulation, vesicular transport and membrane trafficking, and cell death resulting from the cellular stress response. As a result, fission yeast has proven to be a versatile model organism for studying human physiology and diseases such as cell cycle dysregulation and cancer, as well as autophagy and neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's diseases. Given that viruses are obligate intracellular parasites that rely on host cellular machinery to replicate and produce, fission yeast could serve as a surrogate to identify viral proteins that affect host cellular processes. This approach could facilitate the study of virus-host interactions and help identify potential viral targets for antiviral therapy. Using fission yeast for functional characterization of viral genomes offers several advantages, including a well-characterized and haploid genome, robustness, cost-effectiveness, ease of maintenance, and rapid doubling time. Therefore, fission yeast emerges as a valuable surrogate system for rapid and comprehensive functional characterization of viral proteins, aiding in the identification of therapeutic antiviral targets or viral proteins that impact highly conserved host cellular functions with significant virologic implications. Importantly, this approach has a proven track record of success in studying various human and plant viruses. In this protocol, we present a streamlined and scalable molecular cloning strategy tailored for genome-wide and comprehensive functional characterization of viral proteins in fission yeast.
