36626491|t|TCM syndrome differentiation and treatment of narcolepsy based on neurobiological mechanism: A review.
36626491|a|Narcolepsy is a relatively rare brain disorder caused by the selective loss of orexin neurons. Narcolepsy is divided into Narcolepsy Type 1 (NT1) and Narcolepsis Type 2 (NT2). The pathogenesis of NT1 has been well established due to the severe loss of orexin neurons, while NT2 is still poorly understood, and little is known about its underlying neurobiological mechanisms. human leukocyte antigen alleles have been found to strongly influence the development of narcolepsy, with more than 90% of NT1 patients carrying the human leukocyte antigen II allele DQB1*06:02. In addition to the genetic evidence for the DQBI*06:02 allele, some other evidence suggests that a T cell-mediated immune mechanism destroys the orexin neurons of NT1, with CD4 + T cells being key. For this disease, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) therapy has its own characteristics and advantages, especially the combination of acupuncture and medicine in the treatment of this disease in TCM, which has made considerable and gratifying progress. The purpose of this review is to introduce the frontier progress of neurobiology of narcolepsy, and to explore the syndrome differentiation and treatment of narcolepsy with the combined use of TCM and Western medicine combined with TCM.
