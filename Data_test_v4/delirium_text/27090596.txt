27090596|a|Hypothalamic hamartomas are rare tumors that typically present in childhood, often with gelastic seizures, precocious puberty, or as a manifestation of Pallister-Hall syndrome. Neurofibrillary tangles are cytoplasmic aggregates of hyperphosphorylated tau that are best recognized in Alzheimer disease, other tau-associated neurodegenerative diseases, or as part of aging, but occasionally may be seen in low-grade neoplasms with a ganglion cell component as gangliocytoma or ganglioglioma. Herein, we report a case of hypothalamic hamartoma with neurofibrillary tangles.
