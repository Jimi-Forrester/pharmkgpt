36826584|t|Modified Sequential Organ Failure Assessment Score vs. Early Warning Scores in Prehospital Care to Predict Major Adverse Cardiac Events in Acute Cardiovascular Disease.
36826584|a|(1) Background: The Modified Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (mSOFA) is an Early Warning Score (EWS) that has proven to be useful in identifying patients at high risk of mortality in prehospital care. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the predictive validity of prehospital mSOFA in estimating 2- and 90-day mortality (all-cause) in patients with acute cardiovascular diseases (ACVD), and to compare this validity to that of four other widely-used EWS. (2) Methods: We conducted a prospective, observational, multicentric, ambulance-based study in adults with suspected ACVD who were transferred by ambulance to Emergency Departments (ED). The primary outcome was 2- and 90-day mortality (all-cause in- and out-hospital). The discriminative power of the predictive variable was assessed and evaluated by the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC). (3) Results: A total of 1540 patients met the inclusion criteria. The 2- and 90-day mortality rates were 5.3% and 12.7%, respectively. The mSOFA showed the highest AUC of all the evaluated scores for both 2- and 90-day mortality, AUC = 0.943 (0.917-0.968) and AUC = 0.874 (0.847-0.902), respectively. (4) Conclusions: The mSOFA is a quick and easy-to-use EWS with an excellent ability to predict mortality at both 2 and 90 days in patients treated for ACVD, and has proved to be superior to the other EWS evaluated in this study.
