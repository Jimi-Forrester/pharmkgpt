29167486|a|Restricted lobar cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) and cortical superficial siderosis (CSS) are the characteristic markers of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). However, their effects on clinical features has not been evaluated well. The purpose of this study is to investigate the clinical implication of these markers in clinical-radiologically diagnosed CAA. A total of 372 patients with possible or probable CAA who met the modified Boston criteria were recruited in a memory clinic setting. Cortical thickness was measured using surface based methods. Presence of restricted multiple lobar CMBs were independently associated with cortical thinning across the entire cortical regions while presence of CSS was independently associated with cortical thinning primarily in the bilateral frontal region. Presence of restricted multiple lobar CMBs was associated with impairment in all cognitive domains such as attention, language, visuospatial, memory and frontal executive functions while presence of CSS was associated with attention and frontal dysfunction. The relationships of restricted multiple lobar CMBs or CSS with cognitive impairment were partially mediated by thinning in the corresponding cortical regions. Our findings suggested that restricted multiple lobar CMBs and CSS affect distinctive clinical features, providing new insights into potential mechanisms in CAA.
