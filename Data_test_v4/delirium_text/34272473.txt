34272473|a|The aim of this study was to evaluate the short- and long-term blood pressure (BP) variability and right ventricular (RV) remodeling in women with gestational hypertension and preeclampsia, as well as their association. This cross-sectional study included 161 pregnant women (56 normotensive controls, 55 patients with gestational hypertension, and 50 patients with preeclampsia) after 20 weeks of gestation. All women underwent 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring and echocardiographic examination. Our findings showed that 24-h, daytime and nighttime systolic and diastolic BPs, as well as visit-to-visit systolic and diastolic BPs, were significantly higher in women with gestational hypertension and preeclampsia than in control group. Parameters of short- and long-term BP variability gradually increased from controls, throughout women with preeclampsia, to those with gestational hypertension. RV diameter, E/e' and PAP were significantly higher in women with gestational hypertension and preeclampsia than in controls. Global and free wall RV longitudinal strains, as well as corresponding endo- and epicardial strains, gradually reduced from controls to women with preeclampsia. Parameters of short- and long-term BP variability were independently associated with global and free wall RV longitudinal strain. In conclusion, short- and long-term BP variability was higher in women with pregnancy-induced hypertensive disorders. RV diastolic function and mechanics were deteriorated in these women comparing with controls. A significant association between BP variability and RV longitudinal strain underlines the importance of determination of short- and long-term BP variability during pregnancy.
