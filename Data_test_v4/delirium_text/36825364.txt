36825364|a|CONTEXT: Previously, we found Alisma orientalis beverage (AOB), a classic traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formulation, had the potential effect of treating atherosclerosis (AS). The underlying mechanism was still unclear. OBJECTIVE: As an extention of our previous work, to investigate the underlying mechanism of action of AOB in the treatment for AS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Network pharmacology was conducted using SwissTargetPrediction, GeneCards, DrugBank, Metascape, etc., to construct component-target-pathway networks. In vivo, AS models were induced by a high-fat diet (HFD) for 8 consecutive weeks in APOE-/- mice. After the administration of AOB (3.8 g/kg, i.g.) for 8 weeks, we assessed the aortic plaque, four indicators of blood lipids, and expression of the PI3K/AKT/SREBP-1 pathway in liver. RESULTS: Network pharmacology showed that PI3K/AKT/SREBP-1 played a role in AOB's treatment for AS (PI3K: degree = 18; AKT: degree = 17). Moreover, we found that the arterial plaque area and four indicators of blood lipids were all significantly reversed by AOB treatment in APOE-/- mice fed with HFD (plaque area reduced by about 37.75%). In addition, phosphorylated expression of PI3K/AKT and expression of SREBP-1 were obviously increased in APOE-/- mice fed with HFD, which were all improved by AOB (PI3K: 51.6%; AKT: 23.6%; SREBP-1: 40.0%). CONCLUSIONS: AOB had therapeutic effects for AS by improving blood lipids and inhibition of the PI3K/AKT/SERBP-1 pathway in the liver. This study provides new ideas for the treatment of AS, as well as new evidence for the clinical application of AOB.
