39230232|a|Topicality: Providing assistance to patients with polytrauma, in a state of alcohol intoxication, complicated by alcoholic delirium, is a serious problem when providing anesthesia care and, in particular, choosing drugs for sedation. Considering the severity of mechanical damage, complications associated with alcohol intoxication and serious biochemical disorders of the body, namely carbohydrate, lipid metabolism, electrolyte changes, on which the activity of all systems depends, it is necessary to study the influence on the course of these processes, depending on the choice of their medicinal corrections. PURPOSE: The purpose of the work is to choose a sedation method to improve the results of treatment of patients with polytrauma and alcohol withdrawal, based on the study of changes in carbohydrate metabolism indicator. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The paper analyzes the results of a study of 80 patients with polytrauma and chronic alcohol intoxication with a state of alcohol withdrawal, complicated by alcoholic delirium, who received intensive therapy in the 12-bed department of anesthesiology and intensive therapy for patients with combined trauma of the KNP <<Kharkiv City Clinical Hospital of Emergency Medical Care>> named after Prof. O. I. Meschaninov>> KhMR. All patients were diagnosed with polytrauma (thoracic and/or abdominal trauma: rib fractures, hemo-, pneumothorax, hematomas of the liver or spleen, fracture of the bones of the waist, and/or upper and/or lower limbs, fracture of the pelvis). In the course of the research, to achieve the goal, the main indicators of carbohydrate metabolism were determined, which were evaluated by the content of key metabolites: glucose, pyruvic acid, lactate. The study was conducted on the 1st, 3rd and 7th day of hospitalization of the patients. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: In all traumatized patients with alcohol withdrawal syndrome and alcoholic delirium with the use of dexmedetomidine for sedation (group 1) and in patients who were used as sedatives, diazepam and haloperidol (group 2), changes in these parameters were observed in the blood, compared to healthy people of the control group. As for the glucose content in the blood of the patients of the 1st group, on the first day, persistent hyperglycemia was observed in them 1.7 times higher than this indicator in healthy people. Next, patients' blood glucose levels were determined on the 3rd and 7th day after hospitalization. Glucose content on the 3rd day decreased by 9.4% compared to the level determined on the first day. On the 7th day, the content of glucose in the blood decreased to normal values, which is 26.5% lower compared to the content of glucose in the blood on the first day. In the 2nd group of patients, where diazepam and haloperidol were used on the first day, hyperglycemia was also observed - 1.9 times higher than this indicator in the control group of healthy individuals. On the third day, the level of glucose in the blood decreased by 6%. And on the 7th day, it decreased by 20.5%. Thus, hyperglycemia was observed in the blood of victims with alcohol withdrawal syndrome, complicated by delirium during hospitalization, on the 3rd day of hospitalization (first and second groups) and on the 7th day in patients of the second group, which indicates violation of carbohydrate metabolism and the development of hypoxia, with impaired liver and pancreas function. In accordance with the aim and objectives of the study, the blood content of the main metabolites of glucose metabolism - pyruvate and lactate - was also studied upon admission to the hospital and one week after treatment, which made it possible to comprehensively assess possible carbohydrate metabolism disorders and characterize the features of the body's energy supply in the combination of polytrauma and withdrawal alcohol, complicated by alcoholic delirium. According to the results of the research, there is an increase in the content of lactate and pyruvate in patients with polytrauma against the background of chronic alcoholism compared to healthy people. When analyzing the content of lactate in the blood of patients with polytrauma and alcohol withdrawal syndrome, complicated by alcoholic delirium upon admission to the intensive care unit, a significant increase of this indicator was observed by 97.1% and 113.0%, respectively, in patients of the first and second groups. One week after the intensive therapy, the patients of the 1st group had a significant decrease in the lactate content in the blood - by 13% (R<0.0001) compared to the content of this indicator at the time of admission to the hospital. In the blood of the patients of the 2nd group, on the 7th day, the lactate content remained unchanged, and by 106.3% it exceeded this biochemical indicator in the blood of the control group. Hyperpyruvatemia was also observed - when entering the hospital in patients of the 2nd group, the content was 55.4% higher compared to healthy people, remained elevated after a week of treatment - by 30.1%, and did not return to normal values. In the patients of the first group, upon admission to the hospital, the pyruvate content in the blood was 53.0% higher compared to the control group, and on the 7th day it significantly decreased by 18.9%, but did not reach the values of the control group (remained at 24, 1% higher compared to the control). The cause of hyperpyruvatemia and hyperlactatemia in patients may also be a violation of their enzymatic transformation into decay products. Lactate is the final product of anaerobic oxidation of glucose, it is formed due to the transformation of pyruvate, under the conditions of action of the lactate dehydrogenase enzyme in conditions of hypoxia. An important indicator of the state of carbohydrate metabolism, namely the balance of anaerobic and aerobic processes in the body, is the lactate / pyruvate ratio, which in the control group was 14.33 [13.82; 14.49]. In the patients of the first group, an increase in this ratio was observed - and it was 18.46 [18.3; 20.59] and 19.81 [18.96; 21,17] upon admission to the intensive care unit and one week after treatment, respectively. Practically the same value of this ratio was observed in patients of the second group - 19.65 [18.97; 22.3] and 22.73 [21.32 23.91], respectively, according to the time of intensive therapy. The latest figures indicate the restructuring of the energy supply of body tissues during the stay of patients in the intensive care unit. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, in patients with polytrauma and alcohol withdrawal syndrome, complicated by alcoholic delirium, there is an intensification of the processes of anaerobic glycolysis, which is evidenced by an increase in the content of pyruvate, lactate, the lactate/pyruvate ratio, and is accompanied by a hypoxic state. When comparing the terms of stay in the intensive care unit, it was determined that the use of dexmedetomidine for the treatment of alcoholic delirium compared to benzodiazepines allows reducing the time of intensive care by 34 hours. Thus, in group 2, the duration of intensive therapy for alcoholic delirium was 89 [82-96.2] hours, while in group 1 it was reduced to 55 [52.2-59.8] (p=0.020427). In addition, it was found that the consumption of drugs by patients was different. During the first day, it was 20 [20-30] mg in group 1, and 40 [40-50] mg in group 2. The groups also differed significantly in terms of the total dose of the drug during intensive therapy, so in patients of group 1, the total consumption was 30 [30-40] mg, in group 2 - 80 [80-90] mg (p=0.033011).
