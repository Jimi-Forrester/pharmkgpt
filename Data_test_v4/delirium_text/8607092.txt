8607092|a|BACKGROUND: Previously the exclusive domain of the technology of positron emission tomography, functional MRI is now proving capable of mapping functional regions of the human cortex in near real time during specific task activations or in response to any hemodynamic stress. Of particular interest is the opportunity to observe secondary cortical responses, activation due to imagined tasks, memory function, time-resolved pathways through cortical regions, and activation in sub-cortical structures. METHODS AND RESULTS: One method of functional MRI uses blood oxygenation changes, which can be imaged continuously while functional centers are being stimulated. Image intensity can become darker if there is more deoxygenated blood and brighter if more oxygenated blood enters the brain. This concepts works in all perfused tissues in the body, and allows use of the blood oxygenation mechanism to image neuronal activation. A second method takes advantage of the fact that the protons within the MRI slice are always partially saturated by the rapid rate of imaging. As blood flow delivers unsaturated blood water protons into an imaged slice, these arterially-delivered protons will appear very bright in the image. Visualization of this effect is accomplished by simple image subtraction or by comparison of intensity changes as a function of the paradigm application frequency. Using either approach leads directly to a functional map. CONCLUSIONS: At present, clinical applications are rapidly moving toward routine non-invasive mapping of distortions of the functional motor and somatosensory cortex and other cortical regions as a result of brain tumors. Other clinical applications include the observation of the effect of degenerative diseases such as multiple sclerosis. Alzheimer's disease, stroke, migraine, epilepsy, and other diseases causing neuronal loss and Parkinsonism. Functional MRI and its applications will continue to grow exponentially throughout the decade.
