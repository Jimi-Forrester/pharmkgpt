37047364|a|One the main research goals of bioinorganic chemists is the synthesis of novel coordination compounds possessing biological potency. Within this context, three novel iron(III) complexes with the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs diflunisal and diclofenac in the presence or absence of the nitrogen donors 1,10-phenanthroline or pyridine were isolated and characterized by diverse techniques. The complexes were evaluated for their ability to scavenge in vitro free radicals such as hydroxyl, 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl and 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) radicals, revealing their selective potency towards hydroxyl radicals. The in vitro inhibitory activity of the complexes towards the enzymes acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase was evaluated, and their potential to achieve neuroprotection appeared promising. The interaction of the complexes with calf-thymus DNA was examined in vitro, revealing their ability to intercalate in-between DNA nucleobases. The affinity of the complexes for serum albumins was evaluated in vitro and revealed their tight and reversible binding.
