32435145|a|PURPOSE: The present research was designed to evaluate the toxicity of tellurium and its prevention by selenium on the pituitary gland in male Wistar rats. METHODS: 30 rats were used weighing 200-250 gm, and randomly divided them into five groups. Each group contained an equal number of animals. Group-1 was nominated as control group. Group-2 received an intraperitoneal dose of selenium 0.3  mg per kg body wt. Group-3 was administered with tellurium 4.15 mg per kg body wt. Group-4 was given low-dose (L) of both selenium 0.15 and tellurium 2.075, Group-5 was given High-dose (H) of both selenium 0.3 and tellurium 4.15 mg/kg body wt. orally once in a day. After 15 days of dosing, the behavioral activities- motor co-ordination rotarod and grip strength test were measured. On 16th-day animals were sacrificed and activity of LPO, GSH, caspase-3, caspase-9, GPx, GR, SOD, catalase, and AChE were performed on the pituitary gland as per standard method reported. RESULTS: Se when given together with Te, significantly protects the motor coordination up to 32.5%, and also protects the grip strength up to 75% in group 4 and 5 respectively as compared to group- 3. Se + Te treatment protects the activity of TBARS up to 48.68% and GSH is 58%. As compared to control, it protects caspase-3 up to 118% and caspase-9 up to 83%. The level of AChE was also observed to be modulated by the administration of Se in Group- 4 and 5. Se + Te protected AChE up to 28.6%. Similar findings were observed for the biochemical activities of GPx (140% protection), SOD (458%), GR (159%), and catalase (95%) activities that were protected significantly Se + Te in Group- 4 and 5. CONCLUSION: Selenium dose-dependently protects behavioral activities. It also protects apoptosis, oxidative stress, and AChE activities in the pituitary gland.
