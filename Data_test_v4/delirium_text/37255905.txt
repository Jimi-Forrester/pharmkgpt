37255905|t|The Overlap of Diabetes and Osteoarthritis in American Populations.
37255905|a|Diabetes mellitus, a condition in which the body's ability to produce insulin is impaired, and osteoarthritis (OA), a painful degeneration of joint cartilage, are both serious conditions that affect millions of people in the United States (U.S.). Osteoarthritis is a chronic degenerative condition of the joint cartilage, affecting mainly the older population. The purpose of this paper is to find a connection, if any, between diabetes and osteoarthritis and if either condition can predispose an individual to the other. Not only can this review help to explain the co-existence of these two diseases, but it can also be used to look into a cure for patients in the future. After preliminary searches were done on PubMed, results were narrowed using specific keywords and similar risk factors among the two diseases. It was found that these two conditions are actually interrelated due to oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Seeing the high risk of developing one of these conditions and that obesity, one of the biggest risk factors for both diabetes and osteoarthritis, is at an all-time high in this country, a possible connection between the two of these diseases is very prevalent to look into. This information can be used to help correlate not only a better-targeted treatment but also lead to future research into why obesity is one of the biggest risk factors for both conditions.
