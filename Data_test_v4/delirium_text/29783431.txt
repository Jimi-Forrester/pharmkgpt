29783431|t|DiaGenic ASA.
29783431|a|DiaGenic ASA is an innovative Norwegian biotechnology company that seeks to create value for patients, partners and investors by developing new and more patient-friendly diagnostic tests for the early detection of diseases. The company's diagnostic methodology is based on mining disease-specific gene expression signature from easily available clinical samples such as peripheral blood. This patented method has significant potential in the early detection of several important diseases, such as breast cancer and Alzheimer's disease (AD). The company has recently shown that blood-based gene expression tests can be developed for the early detection of both breast cancer and AD. It is expected that DiaGenic will have a prototype ready for its first products by late 2006.
