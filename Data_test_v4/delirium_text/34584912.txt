METHODS: A literature search was conducted using the National Institute of Health (NIH) website (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov) from May 10th, 2012 to Oct 13th, 2020 with stem cells as an intervention in human trials for non-tumorous and non-hematological conditions. There was no restriction for language, research location, and research race. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Search terms initially found a total of 3576 articles. Firstly, 138 terminated or suspended studies were excluded and further 24 repeated studies were excluded. Secondly, 987 tumorous and hematopoietic conditions-related studies were excluded. Lastly, 1218 studies were excluded without stem cell therapy as their primary purpose. A total of 1209 research studies were entered into the analysis and reviewed. The top 4 diseases were about motor system diseases 229 (19.28%). In addition, 206 (17.34%) studies were related to central nervous system (CNS) diseases. 140 (11.78%) were autoimmune diseases or graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after organ transplantation. 129 (10.86%) were about respiratory system diseases, among them, 44.19% projects were about new coronary pneumonia (NCP). The main cell types used in various diseases are Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs), bone marrow stem cells (BM-SCs), peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs), hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), adipose stem cell (ASCs) and precursor cells.
