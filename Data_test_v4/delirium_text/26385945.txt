26385945|t|Synthesis of 9-Aminoacridine Derivatives as Anti-Alzheimer Agents.
26385945|a|In the present study, some 9-aminoacridine derivatives have been synthesized by condensation of 9-aminoacridine with substituted phenacyl, benzoyl, and benzyl halides (RM1-RM6). Compounds were investigated for acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase inhibition potential, considering these enzymes playing a key role in Alzheimer's disease. All derivatives showed better inhibition of enzymes than the standard galantamine, whereas except RM4, all exhibit better results than tacrine, a well-known acridine derivative used for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
