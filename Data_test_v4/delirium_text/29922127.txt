29922127|t|Autophagy in Traumatic Brain Injury: A New Target for Therapeutic Intervention.
29922127|a|Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the most devastating forms of brain injury. Many pathological mechanisms such as oxidative stress, apoptosis and inflammation all contribute to the secondary brain damage and poor outcomes of TBI. Current therapies are often ineffective and poorly tolerated, which drive the explore of new therapeutic targets for TBI. Autophagy is a highly conserved intracellular mechanism during evolution. It plays an important role in elimination abnormal intracellular proteins or organelles to maintain cell stability. Besides, autophagy has been researched in various models including TBI. Previous studies have deciphered that regulation of autophagy by different molecules and pathways could exhibit anti-oxidative stress, anti-apoptosis and anti-inflammation effects in TBI. Hence, autophagy is a promising target for further therapeutic development in TBI. The present review provides an overview of current knowledge about the mechanism of autophagy, the frequently used methods to monitor autophagy, the functions of autophagy in TBI as well as its potential molecular mechanisms based on the pharmacological regulation of autophagy.
