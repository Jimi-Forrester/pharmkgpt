16207502|a|We have initiated a systematic analysis of the role of cholesterol metabolizing genes as risk factors for Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. As part of this analysis, we have assessed the NR1H2 gene on chromosome 19 and report here a modest association with the locus in sibpairs with late onset disease.
