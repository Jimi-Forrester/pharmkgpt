[Subjects and Methods] The study's subjects consisted of 30 community-dwelling elderly people of both genders, whose average age was 78 years. They participated in a program of physical exercise combined with a cognitive-enhancement group training program. This consisted of sessions lasting 60 minutes that took place once a week over 3 months. To assess the participants' levels of cognition and depression, we conducted batteries of tests using, respectively, the Korean versions of the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease assessment packet (CERAD-K) and the Geriatric Depression Scale-Short Form (GDS-SF). [Results] The Verbal Fluency test, Word List Memory test, Modified Boston Naming test, Mini Mental Status Examination (Korean Version) (MMSE-KC), Constructional Praxis task and Constructional Recall task showed significant improvement, but improvement in the Word List Recall and Word List Recognition tests did not achieve significant levels. Meanwhile, the symptoms of depression were shown to decrease significantly. [Conclusion] Physical exercise combined with a cognitive-enhancement group training program was effective in improving, some of the components of cognition, as well as alleviating depression. This program should be used for the prevention of dementia in community-dwelling elderly, through the intervention should be complemented in order to improve more of the components of cognition.
