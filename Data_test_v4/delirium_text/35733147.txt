35733147|a|BACKGROUND: Previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous risk genes for lacunar stroke, but it is challenging to decipher how they confer risk for the disease. We employed an integrative analytical pipeline to efficiently transform genetic associations to identify novel proteins for lacunar stroke. METHODS: We systematically integrated lacunar stroke genome-wide association study (GWAS) (N=7338) with human brain proteomes (N=376) to perform proteome-wide association studies (PWAS), Mendelian randomization (MR), and Bayesian colocalization. We also used an independent human brain proteomic dataset (N=152) to annotate the new genes. RESULTS: We found that the protein abundance of seven genes (ICA1L, CAND2, ALDH2, MADD, MRVI1, CSPG4, and PTPN11) in the brain was associated with lacunar stroke. These seven genes were mainly expressed on the surface of glutamatergic neurons, GABAergic neurons, and astrocytes. Three genes (ICA1L, CAND2, ALDH2) were causal in lacunar stroke (P < 0.05/proteins identified for PWAS; posterior probability of hypothesis 4 >= 75 % for Bayesian colocalization), and they were linked with lacunar stroke in confirmatory PWAS and independent MR. We also found that ICA1L is related to lacunar stroke at the brain transcriptome level. CONCLUSIONS: Our present proteomic findings have identified ICA1L, CAND2, and ALDH2 as compelling genes that may give key hints for future functional research and possible therapeutic targets for lacunar stroke.
