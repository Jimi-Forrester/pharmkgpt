Objective: To investigate if predictive models can be an effective tool for identifying and excluding people unlikely to show cognitive decline as an enrichment strategy in AD trials. Method: We used data from the placebo arms of two phase 3, double-blind trials, EXPEDITION and EXPEDITION2. Patients had 18 months of follow-up. Based on the longitudinal data from the placebo arm, we classified participants into two groups: one showed cognitive decline (any negative slope) and the other showed no cognitive decline (slope is zero or positive) on the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog). We used baseline data for EXPEDITION to train regression-based classifiers and machine learning classifiers to estimate probability of cognitive decline. Models were applied to EXPEDITION2 data to assess predicted performance in an independent sample. Features used in predictive models included baseline demographics, apolipoprotein E epsilon4 genotype, neuropsychological scores, functional scores, and volumetric magnetic resonance imaging. Result: In EXPEDITION, 46.3% of placebo-treated patients showed no cognitive decline and the proportion was similar in EXPEDITION2 (45.6%). Models had high sensitivity and modest specificity in both the training (EXPEDITION) and replication samples (EXPEDITION2) for detecting the stable group. Positive predictive value of models was higher than the base prevalence of cognitive decline, and negative predictive value of models were higher than the base rate of participants who had stable cognition. Conclusion: Excluding persons with AD unlikely to decline from the active and placebo arms of clinical trials using predictive models may boost the power of AD trials through selective inclusion of participants expected to decline.
