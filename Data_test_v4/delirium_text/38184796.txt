METHODS: We used the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) water fraction (CSFF), a magnetic resonance imaging-based biomarker, to characterize brain parenchymal CSF water, reflecting microscopic PVS in parenchyma. We measured CSFF and amyloid beta (Abeta) using 11 C Pittsburgh compound B positron emission tomography to investigate their relationship at both the subject and voxel levels. RESULTS: Our research has demonstrated a positive correlation between the parenchymal CSFF, a non-invasive imaging biomarker indicative of parenchymal glymphatic clearance, and Abeta deposition, observed at both individual and voxel-based assessments in the posterior cingulate cortex. DISCUSSION: This study shows that an increased parenchymal CSFF is associated with Abeta deposition, suggesting that CSFF could serve as a biomarker for brain glymphatic clearance, which can be used to detect early fluid changes in PVS predisposing individuals to the development of AD. HIGHLIGHTS: Cerebrospinal fluid fraction (CSFF) could be a biomarker of parenchymal perivascular space. CSFF is positively associated with amyloid beta (Abeta) deposition at subject level. CSFF in an Abeta+ region is higher than in an Abeta- region in the posterior cingulate cortex. Correspondence is found between Abeta deposition and glymphatic clearance deficits measured by CSFF.
