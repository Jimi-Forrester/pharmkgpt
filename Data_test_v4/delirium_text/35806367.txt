35806367|t|Phosphate in the Context of Cognitive Impairment and Other Neurological Disorders Occurrence in Chronic Kidney Disease.
35806367|a|The nervous system and the kidneys are linked under physiological states to maintain normal body homeostasis. In chronic kidney disease (CKD), damaged kidneys can impair the central nervous system, including cerebrovascular disease and cognitive impairment (CI). Recently, kidney disease has been proposed as a new modifiable risk factor for dementia. It is reported that uremic toxins may have direct neurotoxic (astrocyte activation and neuronal death) and/or indirect action through vascular effects (cerebral endothelial dysfunction, calcification, and inflammation). This review summarizes the evidence from research investigating the pathophysiological effects of phosphate toxicity in the nervous system, raising the question of whether the control of hyperphosphatemia in CKD would lower patients' risk of developing cognitive impairment and dementia.
