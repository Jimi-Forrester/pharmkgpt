37644941|t|Alcohol Dependence and Rib Fracture Outcomes: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
37644941|a|Chronic alcohol use has been associated with impaired pulmonary function, increased risk of pneumonia and poor outcomes after trauma. With a high incidence of rib fractures in this population, the clinical and physiological factors associated with alcohol dependence may influence how these patients recover from thoracic injuries. Therefore, the aim of the systematic review was to examine the effect of alcohol dependence on rib fracture outcomes. The Embase, PubMed and Web of Science databases were searched for studies examining adult patients with rib fractures, with and without a history of alcohol dependency. The outcomes of interest were mortality, pulmonary complications, intensive care length of stay, ventilator days and hospital length of stay. A meta-analysis was performed to combine the data and compare results. Three studies met the criteria for inclusion in the review and all studies were observational in design. Alcohol dependency was associated with increased mortality (OR 1.44 (95% CI: 1.33-1.56)), pneumonia (OR 2.14 (2.02-2.27)) and ARDS (OR 1.71(1.48-1.98)) as well as longer stays in hospital and intensive care (p<0.05). No difference was found in ventilator days between the two groups. Early intensive care review should be considered to reduce complications in this population alongside prompt management of withdrawal symptoms. However, limited primary research exists on this topic and the quality of current evidence is low. Additional primary research is needed to further understand this correlation and draw meaningful conclusions.
