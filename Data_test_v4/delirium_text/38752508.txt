38752508|t|APOE epsilon4 carrier status modifies plasma p-tau181 concentrations in cognitively healthy super-seniors.
38752508|a|INTRODUCTION: This study investigates the effect of apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype on neurology plasma biomarkers in cognitively healthy Super-Seniors. METHODS: Three hundred seventy plasma specimens from Super-Senior participants >= 85 years old, who have never been diagnosed with dementia, cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular, or major pulmonary disease, were analyzed on the Quanterix Simoa HD-X analyzer using commercial Neurology 4-plex E and phosphorylated tau (p-tau)181 assays. RESULTS: Eighty (22%) participants were APOE epsilon4 carriers and 290 (73%) were non-carriers. No significant differences were found between APOE epsilon4 carriers and non-carriers regarding age, sex, or Mini-Mental State Examination scores. In APOE epsilon4 carriers, plasma amyloid beta 42/40 was lower and p-tau181 and glial fibrillary acidic protein were higher compared to non-APOE epsilon4 carriers. After adjusting for demographic variables, p-tau181 was the only biomarker to remain significantly associated with APOE epsilon4 carrier status. DISCUSSION: APOE epsilon4 genotype modifies plasma p-tau181 concentration in seniors resilient to age-related clinical disease, suggesting that some Super-Seniors may have Alzheimer's disease pathology without progressing to cognitive decline. HIGHLIGHTS: Healthy seniors enable identification of associations that may be masked by disease. Plasma phosphorylated tau (p-tau)181 concentrations associate with apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon4 carriership in healthy seniors. APOE should be accounted for when interpreting p-tau181, regardless of disease.
