11090988|a|The inhibition of huperzine A, a potential therapeutic agent to treat Alzheimer's disease, on rat cortical acetylcholinesterase was found to be highly stereospecific. In the present study the effect of the enantiomers of huperzine A on [(3)H]dizocilpine (MK-801) binding to synaptic membrane of rat cerebral cortex was compared. The natural (-)-huperzine A and the synthetic (+)-huperzine A inhibited the specific binding of [(3)H]MK-801 with a similar potency. The IC(50) values were 65+/-7 and 82+/-12 microM (n=5 for each enantiomer, P=0.248), respectively. The result indicates that huperzine A inhibits N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor in rat cerebral cortex without stereoselectivity.
