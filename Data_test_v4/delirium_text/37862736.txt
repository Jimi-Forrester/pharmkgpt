37862736|a|INTRODUCTION: Adequate patient selection is crucial within the treatment of older patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). While previous studies report increased morbidity and mortality in older patients screened positive for frailty, improvements in the perioperative care and postoperative outcomes have raised the question of whether older patients screened positive for frailty still face worse outcomes. This study aimed to investigate the postoperative outcomes of older patients with CRC screened positive for frailty, and to evaluate changes in treatment after frailty screening and geriatric assessment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients >=70 years with primary CRC who underwent frailty screening between 1 January 2019 and 31 October 2021 were included. Frailty screening was performed by the Geriatric-8 (G8) screening tool. If the G8 indicated frailty (G8 <= 14), patients were referred for a comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA). Postoperative outcomes and changes in treatment based on frailty screening and CGA were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 170 patients were included, of whom 74 (43.5%) screened positive for frailty (G8 <= 14). Based on the CGA, the initially proposed treatment plan was altered to a less intensive regimen in five (8.9%) patients, and to a more intensive regimen in one (1.8%) patient. Surgery was performed in 87.8% of patients with G8 <= 14 and 96.9% of patients with G8 > 14 (p = 0.03). Overall postoperative complications were similar between patients with G8 <= 14 and G8 > 14 (46.2% vs. 47.3%, p = 0.89). Postoperative delirium was observed in 7.7% of patients with G8 <= 14 and 1.1% of patients with G8 > 14 (p = 0.08). No differences in 30-day mortality (1.1% vs. 1.5%, p > 0.99) or one-year and two-year survival rates were observed (log rank, p = 0.26). DISCUSSION: Although patients screened positive for frailty underwent CRC surgery less often, those considered eligible for surgery can safely undergo CRC resection within current clinical care pathways, without increased morbidity and mortality. Efforts to optimise perioperative care and minimise the risk of postoperative complications, in particular delirium, seem warranted. A multidisciplinary onco-geriatric pathway may support tailored decision-making in patients at risk of frailty.
