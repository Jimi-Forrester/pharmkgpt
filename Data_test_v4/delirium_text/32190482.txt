32190482|t|Sepsis Patients in Critical Care Units with Obesity: Is Obesity Protective?
32190482|a|Obesity is becoming a global health issue and its prevalence is increasing. It is associated with an increased incidence of illness and sepsis. While obesity is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, obesity has been found to be associated with improvement in mortality outcomes in sepsis when compared to leaner patients, a phenomenon described as an obesity paradox. However, the effect of obesity on mortality in adults requiring treatment for sepsis is unclear. Studies evaluating this effect are inconsistent and there is an increased morbidity still associated with obesity. As well, there are many limitations to these studies confounding interpretation. Future prospective studies minimizing bias and confounding factors are suggested to address this important clinical issue.
