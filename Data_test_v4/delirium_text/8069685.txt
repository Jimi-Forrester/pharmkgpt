8069685|t|beta-Amyloid increases choline conductance of PC12 cells: possible mechanism of toxicity in Alzheimer's disease.
8069685|a|When beta-amyloid-(1-40) is added to PC12 cells, there is an increase in choline conductance that is proportional to the beta-amyloid concentration. If a similar effect occurs in cholinergic brain cells of Alzheimer's disease patients, the intracellular choline concentration would be reduced, leading to a decrease in the production of acetylcholine. This could explain the reduced level of acetylcholine that has been found in post-mortem brain tissue of Alzheimer's disease patients.
