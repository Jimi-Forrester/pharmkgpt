32795118|t|Lovastatin producing by wild strain of Aspergillus terreus isolated from Brazil.
32795118|a|Lovastatin is a drug in the statin class which acts as a natural inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl, a coenzyme reductase reported as being a potential therapeutic agent for several diseases: Alzheimer's, multiple sclerosis, osteoporosis and due to its anti-cancer properties. Aspergillus terreus is known for producing a cholesterol reducing drug. This study sets out to evaluate the production of lovastatin by Brazilian wild strains of A. terreus isolated from a biological sample and natural sources. Carbon and nitrogen sources and the best physicochemical conditions using factorial design were also evaluated. The 37 fungal were grown to produce lovastatin by submerged fermentation. A. terreus URM5579 strain was the best lovastatin producer with a level of 13.96 mg/L. Soluble starch and soybean flour were found to be the most suitable substrates for producing lovastatin (41.23 mg/L) and biomass (6.1 mg/mL). The most favorable production conditions were found in run 16 with 60 g/L soluble starch, 15 g/L soybean flour, pH 7.5, 200 rpm and maintaining the solution at 32  C for 7 days, which led to producing 100.86 mg/L of lovastatin and 17.68 mg/mL of biomass. Using natural strains and economically viable substrates helps to optimize the production of lovastatin and promote its use.
