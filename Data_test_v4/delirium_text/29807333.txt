29807333|t|Structure-activity relationships of beta-hairpin mimics as modulators of amyloid beta-peptide aggregation.
29807333|a|Aggregation of amyloid proteins is currently involved in more than 20 serious human diseases that are actually untreated, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Despite many efforts made to target the amyloid cascade in AD, finding an aggregation inhibiting compound and especially modulating early oligomerization remains a relevant and challenging strategy. We report herein the first examples of small and non-peptide mimics of acyclic beta-hairpins, showing an ability to delay the fibrillization of amyloid-beta (Abeta1-42) peptide and deeply modify its early oligomerization process. Modifications providing better druggability properties such as increased hydrophilicity and reduced peptidic character were performed. We also demonstrate that an appropriate balance between flexibility and stability of the beta-hairpin must be reached to adapt to the different shape of the various aggregated forms of the amyloid peptide. This strategy can be investigated to target other challenging amyloid proteins.
