34711251|t|Altered substrate metabolism in neurodegenerative disease: new insights from metabolic imaging.
34711251|a|Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD) and multiple sclerosis (MS), are relatively common and devastating neurological disorders. For example, there are 6 million individuals living with AD in the United States, a number that is projected to grow to 14 million by the year 2030. Importantly, AD, PD and MS are all characterized by the lack of a true disease-modifying therapy that is able to reverse or halt disease progression. In addition, the existing standard of care for most NDs only addresses the symptoms of the disease. Therefore, alternative strategies that target mechanisms underlying the neuropathogenesis of disease are much needed. Recent studies have indicated that metabolic alterations in neurons and glia are commonly observed in AD, PD and MS and lead to changes in cell function that can either precede or protect against disease onset and progression. Specifically, single-cell RNAseq studies have shown that AD progression is tightly linked to the metabolic phenotype of microglia, the key immune effector cells of the brain. However, these analyses involve removing cells from their native environment and performing measurements in vitro, influencing metabolic status. Therefore, technical approaches that can accurately assess cell-specific metabolism in situ have the potential to be transformative to our understanding of the mechanisms driving AD. Here, we review our current understanding of metabolism in both neurons and glia during homeostasis and disease. We also evaluate recent advances in metabolic imaging, and discuss how emerging modalities, such as fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) have the potential to determine how metabolic perturbations may drive the progression of NDs. Finally, we propose that the temporal, regional, and cell-specific characterization of brain metabolism afforded by FLIM will be a critical first step in the rational design of metabolism-focused interventions that delay or even prevent NDs.
