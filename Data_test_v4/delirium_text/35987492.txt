35987492|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder for which only symptomatic medication is available, except for the recently FDA-approved aducanumab. This lack of effective treatment urges us to investigate alternative paths that might contribute to disease development. In light of the recent SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and the disturbing neurological complications seen in some patients, it is desirable to (re)investigate the viability of the viral infection theory claiming that a microbe could affect AD initiation and/or progression. Here, we review the most important evidence for this theory with a special focus on two viruses, namely HSV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, we discuss the possible involvement of extracellular vesicles (EVs). This overview will contribute to a more rational approach of potential treatment strategies for AD patients.
