30542906|a|Gene therapy has the potential to provide therapeutic benefit to millions of people with neurodegenerative diseases through several means, including direct correction of pathogenic mechanisms, neuroprotection, neurorestoration, and symptom control. Therapeutic efficacy is therefore dependent on knowledge of the disease pathogenesis and the required temporal and spatial specificity of gene expression. An additional critical challenge is achieving the most complete transduction of the target structure while avoiding leakage into neighboring regions or perivascular spaces. The gene therapy field has recently entered a new technological era, in which interventional MRI-guided convection-enhanced delivery (iMRI-CED) is the gold standard for verifying accurate vector delivery in real time. The availability of this advanced neurosurgical technique may accelerate the translation of the promising preclinical therapeutics under development for neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's, Huntington's, and Alzheimer's diseases.
