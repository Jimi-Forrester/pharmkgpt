18426758|a|BACKGROUND: Chronic diseases as well as complications to acute and chronic disease are repeatedly associated with accumulation in the body of glycated and lipoxidated proteins and peptides. These molecules are strongly associated with activation of a specific receptor called RAGE and a long-lasting exaggerated level of inflammation in the body. METHODS: PubMed reports in excess of 5000 papers plus about 14000 articles about the related HbA 1c , most of them published in the last five years. Most of available abstracts have been read and circa 800 full papers studied in detail. RESULTS: RAGE, a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily of cell surface molecules and receptor for advanced glycation endproducts, functions as a master switch, induces sustained activation of NF-kappaB, suppresses a series of endogenous autoregulatory functions and converts long-lasting pro-inflammatory signals into sustained cellular dysfunction and disease. Its activation is associated with high levels of dysfunctioning proteins in body fluids and tissues, and strongly associated with a series of diseases from allergy and Alzheimer to rheumatoid arthritis and urogenital disorders. Heat-treatment, irradiation and ionisation of foods increase the content in foods of AGE/ALE. CONCLUSIONS: Some processed foods are much like tobacco smoking great contributors to accumulation of glycated and lipoxidated molecules in the tissues. Change of life style: avoidance of foods rich in deranged proteins and peptides and increased consumption of antioxidants, especially polyphenols counteracts such a development.
