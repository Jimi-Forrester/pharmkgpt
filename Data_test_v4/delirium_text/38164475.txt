38164475|a|Objectives: Aging and stress synergistically induce behavioral dysfunctions associated with oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in brain regions. Considering the rejuvenating effects of young plasma on aging brain function, in the current study, we examined the effects of young plasma administration on anxiety-like behavior, NADH oxidase, NADPH oxidase, and ER stress markers in the hippocampus of old male rats. Materials and Methods: Young (3 months old) and aged (22 months old) rats were randomly assigned into five groups: young control (Y), aged control (A), aged rats subjected to chronic stress for four weeks (A+S), aged rats subjected to chronic stress and treated with old plasma (A+S+OP), and aged rats subjected to chronic stress and treated with young plasma (A+S+YP). Systemic injection of (1 ml) young and old plasma was performed for four weeks (3 times/week). Results: Young plasma transfusion significantly improved anxiety-like behavior in aged rats and modulated oxidative stress in the hippocampus, evidenced by the increased NADH oxidase (NOX) activity and the reduced NADPH oxidase. In addition, the levels of C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) and Glucose-Regulated Protein 78 (GRP-78), as ER stress markers, markedly reduced in the hippocampus following the administration of young plasma. Conclusion: These findings suggest that young plasma transfusion could reverse anxiety-like behavior in stress-exposed aged rats by modulating the hippocampal oxidative and ER stress markers.
