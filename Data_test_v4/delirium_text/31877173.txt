31877173|a|Amyloid beta (Abeta) plaques aggregation is considered as the "start" of the degenerative process that manifests years before the clinical symptoms appear in Alzheimer's Disease (AD). The aim of this study is to use back propagation neural networks (BPNNs) in 18F-florbetapir PET data for automated classification of four patient groups including AD, late mild cognitive impairment (LMCI), early mild cognitive impairment (EMCI), and significant memory concern (SMC), versus normal control (NC) for early AD detection. Five hundred images for AD, LMCI, EMCI, SMC, and NC, i.e., 100 images for each group, were used from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. The results showed that the automated classification of NC/AD produced a high accuracy of 87.9%, while the results for the prodromal stages of the disease were 66.4%, 60.0%, and 52.9% for NC/LCMI, NC/EMCI and NC/SMC, respectively. The proposed method together with the image preparation steps can be used for early AD detection and classification with high accuracy using Abeta PET dataset.
