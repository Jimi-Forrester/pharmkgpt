36294470|t|TECAR Therapy Associated with High-Intensity Laser Therapy (Hilt) and Manual Therapy in the Treatment of Muscle Disorders: A Literature Review on the Theorised Effects Supporting Their Use.
36294470|a|BACKGROUND: It has been estimated that between 30 and 50 per cent of all injuries that take place throughout participation in a sport are the consequence of soft tissue injuries, and muscle injuries are the primary cause of physical disability. METHODS: The current literature review was designed between October 2021 and April 2022, according to the PRISMA standards, using the PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases. At the screening stage, we eliminated articles that did not fit into the themes developed in all subchapters of the study (n = 70), articles that dealt exclusively with orthopaedics (n = 34), 29 articles because the articles had only the abstract visible, and 17 articles that dealt exclusively with other techniques for the treatment of musculoskeletal disorders. The initial search revealed 343 titles in the databases, from which 56 duplicate articles were automatically removed, and 2 were added from other sources. RESULTS: The combination of these three techniques results in the following advantages: It increases joint mobility, especially in stiff joints, it increases the range of motion, accelerates tissue repair, improves tissue stability, and extensibility, and it reduces soft tissue inflammation (manual therapy). In addition, it decreases the concentration of pro-inflammatory mediators and improves capillary permeability, resulting in the total eradication of inflammation (HILT). It warms the deep tissues, stimulates vascularity, promotes the repose of tissues (particularly muscle tissue), and stimulates drainage (TECAR). CONCLUSIONS: TECAR therapy, combined with manual therapy and High-Intensity Laser therapy in treating muscle diseases, presented optimal collaboration in the recovery process of all muscle diseases.
