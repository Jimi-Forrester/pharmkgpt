32546371|t|Interactome overlap between schizophrenia and cognition.
32546371|a|Cognitive impairments constitute a core feature of schizophrenia, and a genetic overlap between schizophrenia and cognitive functioning in healthy individuals has been identified. However, due to the high polygenicity and complex genetic architecture of both traits, overlapping biological pathways have not yet been identified between schizophrenia and normal cognitive ability. Network medicine offers a framework to study underlying biological pathways through protein-protein interactions among risk genes. Here, established network-based methods were used to characterize the biological relatedness of schizophrenia and cognition by examining the genetic link between schizophrenia risk genes and genes associated with cognitive performance in healthy individuals, through the protein interactome. First, network separation showed a profound interactome overlap between schizophrenia risk genes and genes associated with cognitive performance (SAB = -0.22, z-score = -6.80, p = 5.38e-12). To characterize this overlap, network propagation was thereafter used to identify schizophrenia risk genes that are close to cognition-associated genes in the interactome network space (n = 140, of which 54 were part of the direct genetic overlap). Schizophrenia risk genes close to cognition were enriched for pathways including long-term potentiation and Alzheimer's disease, and included genes with a role in neurotransmitter systems important for cognitive functioning, such as glutamate and dopamine. These results pinpoint a subset of schizophrenia risk genes that are of particular interest for further examination in schizophrenia patient groups, of which some are druggable genes with potential as candidate targets for cognitive enhancing drugs.
