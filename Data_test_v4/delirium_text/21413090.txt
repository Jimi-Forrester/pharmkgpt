21413090|a|Padma  28 is a multicompound herbal preparation based on the camphor formulas from traditional Tibetan medicine (TTM). It contains a variety of different secondary plant substances, which include terpenes and polyphenols such as flavonoids and tannins. As a rich source of antioxidant polyphenols, this herbal Padma 28 preparation seems to be a promising candidate for the treatment of degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), a condition involving oxidative stress. Moreover, polyphenols have also been shown to mitigate AD neuropathology. The study investigated the protective effect of Padma 28 and of certain polyphenols on the neurotoxicity of PC12 cells induced by the neurotoxins: amyloid-beta (Abeta), glutamate, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) and 3-nitropropionate (3-NP), known to be involved in AD, Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis (ALS) and Huntington's disease (HD), respectively. The decrease in cell viability induced by each of the toxins was significantly attenuated by Padma 28 treatment. Also, a decrease in the oxidative capacity of PC12 cells treated with Padma 28 was noted, indicating that the decrease in cell viability induced by the toxins might have been the result of an oxidative stress which could be attenuated by Padma 28 acting as a potent antioxidant. Padma 28, which is available in Europe and USA, seems to be a promising candidate for the treatment of CNS diseases.
