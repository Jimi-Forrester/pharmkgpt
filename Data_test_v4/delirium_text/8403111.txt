8403111|t|A clinical assessment of desflurane anaesthesia and comparison with isoflurane.
8403111|a|In 48 randomly assigned ASA I adult patients undergoing elective orthopaedic procedures, we compared the pharmacodynamics of desflurane (DF) and isoflurane (IF), and their pharmacokinetics during rapid induction of deep anaesthesia (via face mask, to 1.5-2 MAC, after thiopentone), maintenance of anaesthesia at 1.25 MAC, and emergence therefrom. During induction, laryngeal reactions ranging from mild crowing to laryngospasm occurred more frequently with DF than with IF (15/24 DF, 5/24 IF; P < 0.05) and was more severe (9/24 DF, 1/24 IF, excluding the mildest form, P < 0.05). As a result, induction of anaesthesia was not accomplished faster with DF, in spite of a faster equilibration between exhaled and inhaled concentrations. Emergence from DF was more rapid and less complicated by delirium. Pharmacokinetically, the exhaled concentration of DF reached 90% of the inhaled concentration within five minutes of induction, whereas that of IF lagged behind and remained 25% below the inhaled concentration (1 vs 1.34 +/- 0.05) even one hour after induction. Premature ventricular contractions did not occur in any patient even during periods of difficulty with the airway and oxygen desaturation. It is concluded that DF is a safe anaesthetic, pharmacokinetically superior to IF but clinically inferior for induction of anaesthesia via a face mask. Because of the fast equilibration, the exhaled concentration of DF can be controlled more precisely by the dial setting of the vaporiser.
