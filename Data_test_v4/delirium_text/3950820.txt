3950820|t|Clinical heterogeneity in cobalamin C variant of combined homocystinuria and methylmalonic aciduria.
3950820|a|We describe two patients with methylmalonic aciduria and homocystinuria (Cbl C). The disorder was not diagnosed in patient 1 until 4 1/2 years of age; he had a history of fatigue, anorexia, delirium, and spasticity. Moderate megaloblastic bone marrow changes were observed, and there was hyperreflexia of the lower limbs. His condition improved clinically with hydroxycobalamin therapy. Patient 2 was hospitalized at 6 weeks of age because of lethargy and poor feeding. She was found to have macrocytosis. Despite an initial good clinical response to hydroxycobalamin, she developed a striking pigmentary retinopathy. Methylmalonic aciduria persisted in both patients, and homocystinuria persisted in patient 1 despite therapy. The diagnosis of Cbl C disease has been confirmed in both patients by biochemical studies of cultured fibroblasts, including complementation studies. The differences in age of onset and clinical findings together with the similar biochemical findings in these two patients demonstrate the heterogeneity of phenotypic expression in patients with apparently identical abnormalities of vitamin B12 metabolism.
