30675446|t|Hallucinations in an Elderly Patient with Severe Visual Impairment.
30675446|a|Vivid visual hallucinations are common in the geriatric population and can be due to a number of causes such as dementia, delirium, stroke, adverse effects of medication, or ocular disease. We will examine an interesting patient case report, which allowed us to explore two lesser-known causes of these types of hallucinations: Charles Bonnet Syndrome and Anton-Babinski Syndrome. Treatment of these syndromes focuses on supportive care as well as extensive education for the patient and family concerning the benign nature of the visual hallucinations. Many patients, however, end up undergoing extensive diagnostic studies and treatments that are not necessary. This occurs as a result of a lack of education when it comes to the diagnosis and management of these conditions. By raising awareness among healthcare providers, we can prevent unnecessary and potentially harmful workups and treatments for patients suffering from these syndromes.
