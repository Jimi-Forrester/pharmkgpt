39120076|t|A Mutation Losing an RBP-Binding Site in the LncRNA NORSF Transcript Influences Granulosa Cell Apoptosis and Sow Fertility.
39120076|a|Sow fertility is an economically important quantitative trait. Hundreds of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) containing tens of thousands of potential candidate genes are excavated. However, among these genes, non-coding RNAs including long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are often overlooked. Here, it is reported that NORSF is a novel causal lncRNA for sow fertility traits in QTLs. QTLs are characterized for sow fertility traits at the genome-wide level and identified 4,630 potential candidate lncRNAs, with 13 differentially expressed during sow follicular atresia. NORSF, a lncRNA that involved in sow granulosa cell (sGC) function, is identified as a candidate gene for sow fertility traits as a G to A transversion at 128 nt in its transcript is shown to be markedly associated with sow fertility traits. Mechanistically, after forming the RNA:dsDNA triplexes with the promoter of Caspase8, NORSF transcript with allele G binds to an RNA-binding protein (RBP) NR2C1 and recruits it to the promoter of Caspase8, to induce Caspase8 transcription in sGCs. Functionally, this leads to a loss of inducing effect of NORSF on sGC apoptosis by inactivating the death receptor-mediated apoptotic pathway. This study identified a novel causal lncRNA that can be used for the genetic improvement of sow fertility traits.
