24326305|t|A small molecule that displays marked reactivity toward copper- versus zinc-amyloid-beta implicated in Alzheimer's disease.
24326305|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex, multifactorial, neurodegenerative disease that poses tremendous difficulties in pinpointing its precise etiology. A toolkit, which specifically targets and modulates suggested key players, may elucidate their roles in disease onset and progression. We report high-resolution insights on the activity of a small molecule (L2-NO) which exhibits reactivity toward Cu(II)-amyloid-beta (Abeta) over Zn(II)-Abeta.
