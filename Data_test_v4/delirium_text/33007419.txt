33007419|a|Gintonin is a novel glycolipoprotein, which has been abundantly found in the root of Korean ginseng. It holds lysophosphatidic acids (LPAs), primarily identified LPA C18:2, and is an exogenous agonist of LPA receptors (LPARs). Gintonin maintains blood-brain barrier integrity, and it has recently been studied in several models of neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Gintonin demonstrated neuroprotective activity by providing action against neuroinflammation-, apoptosis- and oxidative stress-mediated neurodegeneration. Gintonin showed an emerging role as a modulator of synaptic transmission and neurogenesis and also potentially regulated autophagy in primary cortical astrocytes. It also ameliorated the toxic agent-induced and genetic models of cognitive deficits in experimental NDDs. As a novel agonist of LPARs, gintonin regulated several G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) including GPR40 and GPR55. However, further study needs to be investigated to understand the underlying mechanism of action of gintonin in memory disorders.
