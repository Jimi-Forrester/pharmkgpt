31001006|t|Pattern of Emergent Head Computed Tomography Findings in a Tertiary Care Hospital during off Working Hours: Retrospective Analysis.
31001006|a|INTRODUCTION: Emergency head computed tomography (CT) is rising exponentially during off working hours due to evidence-based medicine, patient's expectation and desires, easy availability and apprehension of medico-legal cases, thereby raising health-care cost. There is huge gap in demand and supply of radiologist, especially during off working hours. There is need to know the pattern of emergency head findings. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of all emergent noncontrast CT head during off working hours in the Department of Radiodiagnosis of a Tertiary Care Hospital, Mumbai, India, which were performed from June 2017 to May 2018. CT findings of 308 patients were analyzed. RESULTS: About 63.6% of total head CT showed no significant abnormality. The most common abnormality was intracranial hemorrhage which was just 9.1% followed by acute infarct which was 6.2%. Extradural hemorrhage, subdural hemorrhage, and subarachnoid hemorrhage was only 1% each of total head CT findings. No significant abnormality was detected in 74.65%, 70.21%, 89.13%, 31.37%, 100%, and 69.09% in cases of head injury, seizure, giddiness/dizziness/syncope, cerebrovascular accident, transient ischemic attack, and altered sensorium, respectively. CONCLUSION: Pattern analysis of emergent head CT reveals that most of the emergent CT head shows no significant abnormality. There is a need for stringent guidelines for emergent head CT, training of emergency physician as well as CT technician for common findings to bridge the radiologist demand-supply gap for providing effective health care in peripheral hospitals.
