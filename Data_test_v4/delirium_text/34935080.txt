34935080|t|The neurochemical pathology of schizophrenia: post-mortem studies from dopamine to parvalbumin.
34935080|a|Research in Peter Riederer's lab in Vienna in the late 1970's came from a strong tradition in post-mortem neurochemical studies, at that time a relatively niche approach in neuroscience research. He was also early to recognise the value of post-mortem brain tissue in elucidating pharmacological mechanisms of neuropsychiatric treatments. I was fortunate to have Peter Riederer as a mentor in my early post-doctoral career; his generous support and the opportunities to use post-mortem brain tissue provided an invaluable grounding on which much of my future research was based. In this paper, I shall provide a brief overview of one trajectory of my research into the neurobiology of schizophrenia that started in the Riederer lab in Vienna investigating dopamine and the D2 receptor. Subsequent research to understand findings of increased dopamine resulted in the identification of reduced GABAergic innervation, culminating in the finding of a deficit in the parvalbumin-containing subtype of GABAergic neurons. Most recent work has been studying how changes in DNA methylation of the parvalbumin gene may relate to these findings in psychotic illness and its animal models.
