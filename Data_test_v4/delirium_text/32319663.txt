32319663|t|Ginsenoside metabolite 20(S)-protopanaxadiol promotes neural stem cell transition from a state of proliferation to differentiation by inducing autophagy and cell cycle arrest.
32319663|a|20(S)-Protopanaxadiol (PPD) is an active ginseng metabolite and is the final form of protopanaxadiol saponins metabolized by human intestinal microflora. The neuroprotective effects and mechanisms underlying PPD on neural stem cells (NSCs) are not completely understood. The aim of the present study was to assess the effects of PPD on the proliferation and differentiation of neural stem cells. In the present study, following treatment with different concentrations of PPD for 24 h, the percentage of BrdU-positive cells decreased significantly with increasing concentrations of PPD. Moreover, flow cytometric analysis results indicated that PPD treatment increased the proportion of cells in the G0/G1 and G2/M phase and decreased the proportion of cells in the S phase. The activation of autophagy, determined by an increased number of autophagic vacuoles and light chain 3 lipidation, was associated with an increase in the expression of the neuronal marker tubulin-beta3 following PPD treatment. PPD also partially rescued NSCs from the inhibitory effects of the autophagic inhibitor wortmannin, suggesting that the effect of PPD on NSC differentiation was associated with autophagy. Collectively, the results indicated that PPD promoted the transition of NSCs from a state of proliferation to differentiation through the induction of autophagy and cell cycle arrest. Therefore, the present study may provide a basis for the development of regenerative therapies based on ginsenoside, an approved and safe drug.
