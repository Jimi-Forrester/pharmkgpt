33439952|a|OBJECTIVE: to analyze in the scientific literature the evidence on nasogastric/nasoenteric tube related adverse events in adult patients. METHOD: integrative literature review through the search of publications in journals indexed in PubMed/MEDLINE, CINAHL, LILACS, EMBASE and Scopus, and hand searching, was undertaken up to April 2017. RESULTS: the sample consisted of 69 primary studies, mainly in English and published in the USA and UK. They were divided in two main categories and subcategories: the first category refers to Mechanical Adverse Events (respiratory complications; esophageal or pharyngeal complications; tube obstruction; intestinal perforation; intracranial perforation and unplanned tube removal) and the second alludes to Others (pressure injury related to fixation and misconnections). Death was reported in 16 articles. CONCLUSION: nasogastric/nasoenteric tube related adverse events are relatively common and the majority involved respiratory harm that resulted in increased hospitalization and/or death. The results may contribute to healthcare professionals, especially nurses, to develop an evidence-based guideline for insertion and correct positioning of bedside enteral tubes in adult patients.
