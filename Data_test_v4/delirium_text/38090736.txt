38090736|t|Novel ibuprofen prodrug: A possible promising agent for the management of complications of Alzheimer's disease.
38090736|a|Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a severe, varied, and complex brain condition that gradually impairs memory and cognitive function. Epidemiological studies have shown that patients who have a history of long-term NSAID use have a decreased risk of developing AD. The objective of this study is to conduct the structural analysis of a novel ibuprofen prodrug and test its anti-Alzheimer's properties. Methods: Computational and docking studies were conducted using AMBER 18 package. The in-vivo studies were performed using aluminum chloride-induced experimental AD in rats. Adult Wistar rats of either sex were used and treated with aluminum chloride (32.5 mg/kg, p.o) and ibuprofen prodrug (50 mg/kg, p.o) daily for 30 days. The hole-board test and elevated plus maze were conducted on 10th, 20th and 30th day. Further, on 31st day, animals were euthanized and the brain tissue was used for histopathology. The results obtained were subjected to statistical analysis by one-way ANOVA and Dunnet's test, p < 0.05 was considered to indicate the significance. Results: The structural configuration of the novel compound indicated the presence of several structures such as aliphatic, aromatic, and asymmetry in the compound. The geometrical analysis indicated that the ibuprofen conjugate has dreiding energy of 51.22 kcal/mol with a van der waals radius of 62.56 A. The Huckel analysis confirmed the presence of aromatic rings in the compound. The molecular docking studies suggested affinity towards beta-secretase and acetylcholinesterase, besides indicating that the compound has ideal characteristics for the oral route (Log P = 2.33), cellular absorption (TPSA = 95.50), and oral bioavailability (number of rotatable bonds = 10). The toxicity profile indicated devoid of major systemic toxicity with mild possibility of cytotoxicity. The in-vivo analysis showed that the Ibu-prodrug significantly (P < 0.001) reversed the changes induced by aluminum chloride and restored histomorphological features in brain tissue. Conclusion: The findings suggested that the ibuprofen conjugate might possess the potential to manage the complications of AD. The action appears to be mediated through inhibition of beta-secretase and acetylcholinesterase activities. More studies might aid in identifying a specific therapeutic intervention that is still lacking in the treatment of AD.
