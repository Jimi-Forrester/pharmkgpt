22008870|t|Art and Parkinson's disease: a dramatic change in an artist's style as an initial symptom.
22008870|a|In Parkinson's disease (PD), nonmotor symptoms manifest before motor symptoms. In this report, we present a remarkable case of a semiprofessional painter with PD whose painting style dramatically changed from abstract painting to realism before he developed motor, psychiatric, and autonomic nerve disorders. This case suggests that certain types of visual creativity may be impaired in the very early, presymptomatic stages of PD.
