39668341|t|REmoval of cytokines during CArdiac surgery (RECCAS): a randomised controlled trial.
39668341|a|BACKGROUND: Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) triggers marked cytokine release often followed by a systemic inflammatory response syndrome, associated with adverse postoperative outcomes. This trial investigates the intraoperative use of haemoadsorption (HA) during cardiac surgery with CPB to assess its impact on postoperative systemic inflammatory response. METHODS: In this prospective randomised controlled trial (ethics approval no. 5094-14DRKS00007928), patients (> 65 years) undergoing elective on-pump cardiac surgery were randomised to intraoperative HA (CytoSorb) during CPB or standard care without HA. Primary outcome was the difference in mean interleukin (IL)-6 serum concentrations between groups on intensive care unit (ICU) admission. The secondary outcomes included various clinical and biochemical endpoints. Statistical methods included paired and unpaired t-tests, Wilcoxon, Mann-Whitney U-tests, and chi-square tests. RESULTS: Thirty-eight patients were allocated to receive either intraoperative HA (n = 19) or standard care (n = 19). The primary outcome, IL-6 levels on ICU admission, did not differ between the study group and controls (214.4 +- 328.8 vs. 155.8 +- 159.6 pg/ml, p = 0.511). During surgery pre- versus post-adsorber IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, heparan sulfate and myoglobin post- levels were reduced. Furthermore, IL-6 levels did not differ between the study groups on day 1 and 2 in the ICU. While sequential organ failure assessment scores, lactate levels, and C-reactive protein and procalcitonin (PCT) showed no statistically significant differences. Regarding haemodynamic stability in the treatment group the cardiac index (3.2 +- 0.7 vs. 2.47 +- 0.47 l/min/m2, p = 0.012) on ICU day 2 increased, and lower fluid requirements as well as decreased fibrinogen requirement were observed. Need for renal replacement therapy did not differ though a shorter duration was observed in the treatment group. Time on ventilator, respiratory parameters, infectious complications, delirium scores, ICU and hospital lengths of stay, and mortality did not differ between groups. CONCLUSION: HA did not reduce the IL-6 level on ICU admission or afterwards. Even though HA reduced cytokine load during cardiac surgery in the treatment group. There were no significant differences between groups in the postoperative course of other cytokine concentrations, organ dysfunction, ICU and hospital lengths of stay and mortality rates.
