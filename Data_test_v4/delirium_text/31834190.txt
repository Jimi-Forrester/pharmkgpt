31834190|t|Zolpidem-Associated Consequences: An Updated Literature Review With Case Reports.
31834190|a|A post-2000 literature search reviewed prevalence of health consequences associated with zolpidem, plus two salient case reports. Common zolpidem-related harms encompassed accidents, falls, overdoses, delirium, and infections. Risks to others included assaults, vehicular accidents, various crimes, and civil actions that occurred during zolpidem-induced delirium, withdrawal, and other impediments. Remarkably, much harm occurred while patients were taking therapeutic doses of licitly prescribed zolpidem (10-30 mg). Zolpidem-associated health, behavioral, and social problems comprise an international pandemic of preventable heath misfortunes.
