19616093|a|Amyloid beta (Abeta) plays a critical role in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease. Increasing evidence indicates mitochondria as an important target of Abeta toxicity; however, the effects of Abeta toxicity on mitochondria have not yet been fully elucidated. Recent biochemical studies in vivo and in vitro implicate mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) formation involvement in Abeta-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction. mPTP formation results in severe mitochondrial dysfunction such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, mitochondrial membrane potential dissipation, intracellular calcium perturbation, decrease in mitochondrial respiration, release of pro-apoptotic factors and eventually cell death. Cyclophilin D (CypD) is one of the more well-known mPTP components and recent findings reveal that Abeta has significant impact on CypD-mediated mPTP formation. In this review, the role of Abeta in the formation of mPTP and the potential of mPTP inhibition as a therapeutic strategy in AD treatment are examined.
