30995776|t|Considerations for the Use of Polyphenols as Therapies in Neurodegenerative Diseases.
30995776|a|Over the last two decades, the increase in the incidence of neurodegenerative diseases due to the increasingly ageing population has resulted in a major social and economic burden. At present, a large body of literature supports the potential use of functional nutrients, which exhibit potential neuroprotective properties to mitigate these diseases. Among the most studied dietary molecules, polyphenols stand out because of their multiple and often overlapping reported modes of action. However, ambiguity still exists as to the significance of their influence on human health. This review discusses the characteristics and functions of polyphenols that shape their potential therapeutic actions in neurodegenerative diseases while the less-explored gaps in knowledge of these nutrients will also be highlighted.
