21836672|a|All the articles published in the Indian Journal of Psychiatry (IJP) from 1958 to 2009 on aging, dementia and other mental health issues of late life were systematically reviewed. There were only a limited number of research articles on dementia in the IJP. Most of the Indian studies on dementia were published elsewhere. People above the age of 60 years constitute about 5% of patients seen in tertiary care settings. High prevalence of psychiatric morbidity was reported among community resident older people. Depression was the commonest mental health problem in late life. We need to develop community-based interventions for management of common conditions like depression in late life. The effectiveness of these interventions needs to be established. It is important to identify risk factors for depression and dementia in our population. We could then try and modify these factors to reduce the prevalence of these conditions.
