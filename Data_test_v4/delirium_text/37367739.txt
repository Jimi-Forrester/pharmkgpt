37367739|t|Comprehensive Geriatric Care in Older Adults: Walking Ability after an Acute Fracture.
37367739|a|BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Comprehensive Geriatric Care (CGC) is a specific multimodal treatment for older patients. In the current study, we aimed to investigate walking performance after CGC in medically ill patients versus those with fractures. METHODS: The timed up and go test (TuG), a 5-grade scale assessment (1 = no walking impairment to 5 = no walking ability at all) for evaluating individual walking ability was performed in all patients who underwent CGC prior to and after treatment. Factors associated with improvement in walking ability were analyzed in the subgroup of patients with fractures. RESULTS: Out of 1263 hospitalized patients, 1099 underwent CGC (median age: 83.1 years (IQR 79.0-87.8 years); 64.1% were female). Patients with fractures (n = 300) were older than those without (n = 799), (median 85.6 versus 82.4 years, p = 0.001). Improvement in TuG after CGC was found in 54.2% of the fracture patients compared to just 45.9% of those without fractures. In fracture group patients, TuG improved from median 5 on admission to median 3 on discharge (p = 0.001). In fracture patients, improvement in walking ability was associated with higher Barthel index values on admission (median 45 (IQR: 35-55) versus 35 (IQR: 20-50): p = 0.001) and Tinetti assessment scores (median 9 (IQR: 4-14.25) versus 5 (IQR: 0-13); p = 0.001) and was negatively associated with the diagnosis of dementia (21.4% versus 31.5%; p = 0.058). CONCLUSION: CGC improved walking ability in more than half of all patients examined. Older patients in particular might benefit from undergoing the procedure after an acute fracture. A better initial functional status favors a positive result following the treatment.
