36140387|t|The Evolution of Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-Cell Therapy in Children, Adolescents and Young Adults with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.
36140387|a|Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR T) therapy is a revolutionary treatment for pediatric, adolescent and young adult patients (AYA) with relapsed/refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. While the landscape of immunotherapy continues to rapidly evolve, widespread use of CAR T therapy is limited and many questions remain regarding the durability of CAR T therapy, methods to avoid CAR T therapy resistance and the role of consolidative stem cell transplant. Modified strategies to develop effective and persistent CAR T cells at lower costs and decreased toxicities are warranted. In this review we present current indications, limitations and future directions of CAR T therapy for ALL in the pediatric and AYA population.
