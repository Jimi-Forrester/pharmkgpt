27330912|a|BACKGROUND: We report our long-term experience with 119 cases of N-shaped orthotopic ileal neobladder. METHODS: Between March 1996 and July 2013, a total of 119 patients (102 men, 17 women) underwent cystectomy with creation of an N-shaped orthotopic ileal neobladder. The Clavien-Dindo classification score was used for grading early (<3 months postoperative), late, and pouch-related and non-pouch-related complications. Daytime and nighttime continence were evaluated for male and female patients separately, with patients subdivided in three groups: completely continent, use of <=1 pad, and use of >1 pad. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 75 months (range 3-204). Early complications (15 major, 54 minor) occurred in 39.5 % of 119 patients whereas 53.1 % presented with late complications (56 major, 39 minor; 111 patients evaluated). Urinary infection and outlet obstruction were both the most frequent early and late pouch-related complications; early non-pouch-related complications were mainly infectious and gastrointestinal, and the most common late non-pouch-related problem was wound herniation. At 12 months, 96 and 60 % of the men and 84.6 and 66.7 % of the women respectively achieved daytime and nighttime continence. CONCLUSION: Complication rates of the N-shaped orthotopic ileal neobladder were relatively high, probably because of meticulous recording and follow-up. Daytime continence rates were better than nighttime rates. N-shaped orthotopic ileal neobladder can be a good option for urinary diversion in selected patients who undergo radical cystectomy.
