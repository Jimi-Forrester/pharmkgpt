38265475|a|This article provides an overview of the background knowledge of ferroptosis in the nervous system, as well as the key role of nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) in regulating ferroptosis. The article takes Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) as the starting point to explore the close association between Nrf2 and ferroptosis, which is of clear and significant importance for understanding the mechanism of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) based on oxidative stress (OS). Accumulating evidence links ferroptosis to the pathogenesis of NDs. As the disease progresses, damage to the antioxidant system, excessive OS, and altered Nrf2 expression levels, especially the inhibition of ferroptosis by lipid peroxidation inhibitors and adaptive enhancement of Nrf2 signaling, demonstrate the potential clinical significance of Nrf2 in detecting and identifying ferroptosis, as well as targeted therapy for neuronal loss and mitochondrial dysfunction. These findings provide new insights and possibilities for the treatment and prevention of NDs.
