37803188|t|Evaluation of the Neuroprotective Effect of Organic Selenium Compounds: An in Vitro Model of Alzheimer's Disease.
37803188|a|Selenium (Se) is an essential trace element for human health and plays an important role in the development and maintenance of central nervous system functions. Se deficiency has been associated with cognitive decline and increased oxidative stress. The increase in oxidative stress is one of the hypotheses for the emergence and worsening of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). To investigate the neuroprotective effects of organic Se compounds in human neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y) differentiated into cholinergic neurons-like. The SH-SY5Y cells were differentiated into cholinergic neuron-like with retinoic acid (RA) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). AD was mimicked exposing the cells to okadaic acid (OA) and beta-amyloid protein (Abeta). The neuroprotective effect of organic Se compounds, selenomethionine (SeMet) and Ebselen, was evaluated through cell viability tests, acetylcholinesterase and antioxidant enzyme activities, and detection of reactive oxygen species (ROS). None of the SeMet concentrations tested protected against the toxic effect of OA + Abeta. On the other hand, previous exposure to 0.1 and 1 microM Ebselen protected cells from the toxic effect of OA + Abeta. Cell differentiation induced by RA and BDNF exposure was effective, showing characteristics of neuronal cells, and pointing to a promising model of AD. Ebselen showed a protective effect, but more studies are needed to identify the mechanism of action.
