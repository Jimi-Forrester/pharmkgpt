38960272|t|Tannic acid as a biphasic modulator of tau protein liquid-liquid phase separation.
38960272|a|Tannic acid (TA) is a natural polyphenol that shows great potential in the field of biomedicine due to its anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, anti-bacterial, anti-tumor, anti-virus, and neuroprotective activities. Recent studies have revealed that liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) is closely associated with protein aggregation. Therefore, modulating LLPS offers new insights into the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we investigated the influence of TA on the LLPS of the Alzheimer's-related protein tau and the underlying mechanism. Our findings indicate that TA affects the LLPS of tau in a biphasic manner, with initial promotion and subsequent suppression as the TA to tau molar ratio increases. TA modulates tau phase separation through a combination of hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds. The balance between TA-tau and tau-tau interactions is found to be relevant to the material properties of TA-induced tau condensates. We further illustrate that the modulatory activity of TA in phase separation is highly dependent on the target proteins. These findings enhance our understanding of the forces driving tau LLPS under different conditions, and may facilitate the identification and optimization of compounds that can rationally modulate protein phase transition in the future.
