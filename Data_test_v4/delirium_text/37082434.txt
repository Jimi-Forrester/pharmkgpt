37082434|t|SARS-CoV-2: Nutritional determinants of reducing the risk of infection of the central nervous system.
37082434|a|Purpose: The aim of this study is to assess the nutritional determinants that may contribute to potentially reducing the risk of COVID-19 central nervous system infection or, if infection occurs, to experience it in a mild form. Views: In this study, the authors collected data on nutrients that support traditional drug treatment and potentially reduce central nervous system infections, while also indicating the role they play in the central nervous system (CNS). The article points out that long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids polyunsaturated fatty acids, probiotics and prebiotics, as well as vitamin D selenium and zinc play a role in supporting immune function and reducing the risk of CNS infections. It should be noted that, due to the novel nature of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, limited number of studies evaluating the potential impact of dietary components on COVID-19 risk reduction or their adjunctive effect on treatment are available. Therefore, further clinical studies are needed to confirm these results. Conclusions: The dietary habits and nutrients described in the article support medical care, including vaccination and other therapies. They are likely to reduce the risk of CNS SARS-CoV-2 infection. The functioning of the physiological gut-brain axis supported by probiotics, polyphenols, certain minerals such as zinc, selenium and vitamin D consumed with the diet, can probably reduce the cost of COVID-19 treatment on the CNS. Also, nutrients other than those mentioned in the article, including vitamins A, E, B1, B6, B12 and iron, could potentially reduce the cost of the treatment of this disease.
