36980898|t|Deep Learning-Based Feature Extraction with MRI Data in Neuroimaging Genetics for Alzheimer's Disease.
36980898|a|The prognosis and treatment of patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been among the most important and challenging problems over the last few decades. To better understand the mechanism of AD, it is of great interest to identify genetic variants associated with brain atrophy. Commonly, in these analyses, neuroimaging features are extracted based on one of many possible brain atlases with FreeSurf and other popular software; this, however, may cause the loss of important information due to our incomplete knowledge about brain function embedded in these suboptimal atlases. To address the issue, we propose convolutional neural network (CNN) models applied to three-dimensional MRI data for the whole brain or multiple, divided brain regions to perform completely data-driven and automatic feature extraction. These image-derived features are then used as endophenotypes in genome-wide association studies (GWASs) to identify associated genetic variants. When we applied this method to ADNI data, we identified several associated SNPs that have been previously shown to be related to several neurodegenerative/mental disorders, such as AD, depression, and schizophrenia.
