32745144|t|Role of serum uric acid in ischemic stroke: A case-control study in Bangladesh.
32745144|a|INTRODUCTION: Increased level of serum uric acid (SUA) is often considered a risk factor for ischemic stroke. This study was conducted to examine the association of SUA level with ischemic stroke and assessed gender-based differences, if any. METHODS: In this case-control study, neuroimaging-confirmed ischemic stroke patients were recruited as cases within three days of an incident from neurology in-patient department, and as controls, patients without stroke history were recruited from neurology out-patient department. Blood was collected from the respondents of both groups to assess SUA level, lipid profile and oral glucose tolerance test. Binary logistic regression was done for estimating the risks of ischemic stroke. RESULTS: A total of 338 participants were recruited, where 169 were cases and 169 were controls. Around 60 percent respondents of both case and control groups were male. Mean SUA levels for cases and controls were 6.03 (SD 1.84) mg/dl and 4.04 (SD 1.46) mg/dl, respectively. After adjustment for age, tobacco consumption status, diabetes, hypertension, coronary heart disease and dyslipidemia, elevated SUA level was found to be significantly associated with ischemic stroke only in females (OR = 1.49; 95% CI = 1.01-2.19; p<0.05). Overall, each unit increase in SUA level exhibits 25 percent increment in odds of having ischemic stroke (OR = 1.25; 95% CI = 1.02-1.5372; p<0.05). CONCLUSION: This study concluded that elevated SUA level is significantly associated with the acute phase of an ischemic stroke and gender-specific analysis demonstrates this association only in females.
