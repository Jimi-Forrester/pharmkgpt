35078351|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the presence of amyloid beta (Abeta) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), neuronal and synaptic loss and inflammation of the central nervous system (CNS). The majority of AD research has been dedicated to the understanding of two major AD hallmarks (i.e. Abeta and NFTs); however, recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) data indicate neuroinflammation as having a critical role in late-onset AD (LOAD) development, thus unveiling a novel avenue for AD therapeutics. Recent evidence has provided much support to the innate immune system's involvement with AD progression; however, much remains to be uncovered regarding the role of glial cells, specifically microglia, in AD. Moreover, numerous variants in immune and/or microglia-related genes have been identified in whole-genome sequencing and GWAS analyses, including such genes as TREM2, CD33, APOE, API1, MS4A, ABCA7, BIN1, CLU, CR1, INPP5D, PICALM and PLCG2. In this review, we aim to provide an insight into the function of the major LOAD-associated microglia response genes.
