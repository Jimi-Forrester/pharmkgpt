31888754|t|Unique primed status of microglia under the systemic autoimmune condition of lupus-prone mice.
31888754|a|BACKGROUND: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease characterized by the production of various autoantibodies. This disease causes disabling neuropsychiatric symptoms even in the absence of apparent inflammation in the central nervous system (CNS), but the mechanisms involved remain unknown. Innate immune-mediated inflammation has attracted attention as a pathogenic mechanism in neuropsychiatric diseases. METHODS: We investigated the CNS of lupus-prone mice focusing on innate immunity. Three strains of lupus-prone mice, FcgammaRIIB-/-Yaa, an F1 hybrid of NZB and NZW (NZB/NZW) mice, and MRL/Faslpr (MRL/lpr) mice were used to analyze CNS immunopathology. RESULTS: Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated the numbers of brain CD45+ cells were increased compared with controls in lupus-prone mice. Upregulation of MHC class I and PDCA1 was observed in microglia and CD11b+ myeloid cells of lupus-prone mice, indicating they were activated in response to interferons (IFN). Microglial gene expression analysis of FcgammaRIIB-/-Yaa mice revealed the upregulation of IFN-responsive genes and inflammation-related genes including Axl, Clec7a, and Itgax, which were previously reported in neurodegenerative conditions and primed conditions. Upregulated chemokine gene expressions including Ccl5 and Cxcl10 were concurrent with increased numbers of T cells and monocytes, especially Ly6Clo monocytes in the CNS. Upregulation of Axl, Clec7a, Itgax, Ccl5, and Cxcl10 was also observed in NZB/NZW mice, indicating common lupus pathology. The primed status of microglia in FcgammaRIIB-/-Yaa mice was also demonstrated by morphological changes such as enlarged cell bodies with hypertrophic processes, and hyperreactivity to lipopolysaccharide. Immunohistochemistry of FcgammaRIIB-/-Yaa mice indicated reactive responses of astrocytes and vascular endothelium. Behavioral studies of FcgammaRIIB-/-Yaa mice revealed depressive-like behavior and heat hyperalgesia in the forced swim test and the tail-flick test, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicated that microglia in lupus exhibit a unique primed phenotype characterized by the upregulated expressions of neurodegeneration-related genes and IFN-responsive genes. Interaction with peripheral cells and brain resident cells was presumed to orchestrate neuroinflammation. Targeting innate immune cells, such as microglia and monocytes, may be a promising therapeutic approach for neuropsychiatric SLE.
