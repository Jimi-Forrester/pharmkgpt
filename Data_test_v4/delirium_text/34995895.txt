34995895|t|Imaging biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease and glaucoma: Current and future practices.
34995895|a|Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness worldwide. Although intraocular pressure is the main risk factor for glaucoma, several intraocular pressure independent factors have been associated with the risk of developing the disease and its progression. The diagnosis of glaucoma relies on clinical features of the optic nerve, visual field test, and optical coherence tomography. However, the multidisciplinary aspect of the disease suggests that other biomarkers may be useful for the diagnosis, thus underling the importance of novel imaging techniques supporting clinicians. This review analyzes the common pathogenic mechanisms between glaucoma and Alzheimer's disease and the possible novel approaches for diagnosis and follow up.
