27833223|t|Psychiatric Comorbidity and Physical Correlates in Alcohol-dependent Patients.
27833223|a|AIM: To examine the prevalence and pattern of comorbidity in alcohol dependence and its relationship with physical and laboratory findings. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty males with alcohol dependence were examined using the Hindi version of Diagnostic Interview for Genetic Studies, the International Classification of Disease-10th Edition Personality Disorder Examination, Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test for alcohol use, global assessment of functioning, blood sampling electrocardiogram, and ultrasonogram. RESULTS: Eighty-seven percent had a comorbid Axis I or an Axis II psychiatric disorder, over 78% had nicotine dependence, and 56% had comorbid Axis II disorder, antisocial personality being the most common. Gamma glutamyl transpeptidase levels were significantly associated with comorbidity. CONCLUSIONS: High comorbidity of Axis I psychiatric disorders was found among persons with alcohol dependence. Axis II disorders were also present.
