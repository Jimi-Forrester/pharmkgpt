In Parkinson's disease (PD), alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) forms such aggregates called Lewy bodies (LBs). Recently, it has been reported that aggregates of alpha-syn with a cross-beta structure are capable of propagating within the brain in a prionlike manner. However, the presence of cross-beta sheet-rich aggregates in LBs has not been experimentally demonstrated so far. Here, we examined LBs in thin sections of autopsy brains of patients with PD using microbeam X-ray diffraction (XRD) and found that some of them gave a diffraction pattern typical of a cross-beta structure. This result confirms that LBs in the brain of PD patients contain amyloid fibrils with a cross-beta structure and supports the validity of in vitro propagation experiments using artificially formed amyloid fibrils of alpha-syn. Notably, our finding supports the concept that PD is a type of amyloidosis, a disease featuring the accumulation of amyloid fibrils of alpha-syn.
