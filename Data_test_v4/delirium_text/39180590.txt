39180590|t|T Cells Trafficking into the Brain in Aging and Alzheimer's Disease.
39180590|a|The meninges, choroid plexus (CP) and blood-brain barrier (BBB) are recognized as important gateways for peripheral immune cell trafficking into the central nervous system (CNS). Accumulation of peripheral immune cells in brain parenchyma can be observed during aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the mechanisms by which peripheral immune cells enter the CNS through these three pathways and how they interact with resident cells within the CNS to cause brain injury are not fully understood. In this paper, we review recent research on T cells recruitment in the brain during aging and AD. This review focuses on the possible pathways through which T cells infiltrate the brain, the evidence that T cells are recruited to the brain, and how infiltrating T cells interact with the resident cells in the CNS during aging and AD. Unraveling these issues will contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms of aging and AD from the perspective of immunity, and hopefully develop new therapeutic strategies for brain aging and AD.
