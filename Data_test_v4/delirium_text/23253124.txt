23253124|t|Triptolide with potential medicinal value for diseases of the central nervous system.
23253124|a|Tripterygium wilfordii Hook.f. (TWHF) has a long history as a Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) herb that aids in treating inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. The major bioactive component of TWHF is triptolide, which has been recognized to possess a broad spectrum of biological profiles including antiinflammatory, immunosuppressive, antifertility, and antitumor activities, as well as neurotrophic and neuroprotective effects. Limitation of triptolide, such as poor water solubility and severe systemic toxicity, has postponed clinical development and trials; however, the wide range of medicinal value of triptolide has been drawing intensive worldwide attention. In particular, triptolide has been shown to have significant effects on central nervous system (CNS) diseases, such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, spinal cord and brain injury, and multiple sclerosis. This review focuses on the potential therapeutic role of triptolide on CNS diseases, and discusses the structural features, potential modifications, and the other pharmacological activities of triptolide.
