33468711|a|Among parent cyclodextrins (CDs), alpha-CD (a-CD) has been utilized in a number of nutraceutical products, and approved as a dietary fiber to affect glycemic response and reduce dietary fat absorption. To extend our current knowledge on the biology of this natural carbohydrate, here we investigated its potential effects on cellular water uptake and aging. Two independent in vivo biological test systems were used, a single cell Xenopus oocyte with expressed human aquaporin for cell hydration studies and the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans for testing life span in the treated animals. a-CD was found to enhance water uptake through aquaporins of oocytes. Furthermore, the compound promoted longevity in C. elegans. Together, these results raise a rational for assaying a-CD as a potent drug candidate in treating various age-related diseases.
