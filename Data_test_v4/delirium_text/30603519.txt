30603519|t|Extracellular Vesicles in Neurodegenerative Diseases: A Double-Edged Sword.
30603519|a|Extracellular vesicles (EVs), a heterogenous group of membrane-bound particles, are virtually secreted by all cells and play important roles in cell-cell communication. Loaded with proteins, mRNAs, non-coding RNAs and membrane lipids from their donor cells, these vesicles participate in normal physiological and pathogenic processes. In addition, these sub-cellular vesicles are implicated in the progression of neurodegenerative disorders. Accumulating evidence suggests that intercellular communication via EVs is responsible for the propagation of key pathogenic proteins involved in the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's diseases, Alzheimer's diseases and other neurodegenerative disorders. For therapeutic perspective, EVs present advantage over other synthetic drug delivery systems or cell therapy; ability to cross biological barriers including blood brain barrier (BBB), ability to modulate inflammation and immune responses, stability and longer biodistribution with lack of tumorigenicity. In this review, we summarized the current state of EV research in central nervous system in terms of their values in diagnosis, disease pathology and therapeutic applications.
