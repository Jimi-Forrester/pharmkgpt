35656440|a|Objectives: The Ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) phenomenon has a critical role in brain injuries induced by some kinds of stroke. The current study investigates the effects of Coenzyme Q10 (Q10) on global cerebral I/R in rats. Materials and Methods: Fifty male Wistar rats were used in this study. The global cerebral I/R was induced by obstructing both common carotid arteries for 20 min and the animals were treated with Q10 (200 mg/kg; PO.) for 6 weeks. Depressive and anxiety-like behaviors were assessed using the elevated plus-maze and forced swimming test, respectively. Working and spatial learning and memory were assessed by the Y-maze continuous alternation task and Morris water maze. The brain tissues were evaluated for brain edema, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities. Results: Our results indicated that global cerebral I/R increased anxiety and depression-like behavior as well as reduced cognitive performance. Moreover, the levels of BDNF and activities of SOD are reduced in stroke animals. Chronic post-stroke treatment with Q10 decreased brain edema. Furthermore, Q10 administration reduced anxiety and depressive-like behavior as well as cognitive impairments in stroke animals. Q10 also increased the SOD activities and BDNF levels in the brain tissues of stroke animals. Conclusion: Finally, we can conclude that using Q10 supplementation may be beneficial against the global cerebral I/R complications.
