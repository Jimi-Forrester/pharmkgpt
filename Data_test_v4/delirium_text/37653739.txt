37653739|a|BACKGROUND: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown uncertain clinical benefits from perioperative intravenous glucocorticoids for perioperative neurocognitive disorders (PND). Thus, this meta-analysis was performed to evaluate whether perioperative intravenous glucocorticoids can decrease the occurrence of PND among adults undergoing surgery. METHODS: We searched 4 databases (MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL and Web of Science) for RCTs that assessed the incidence of PND in adults (aged >= 18 years old) after surgery. Two reviewers independently assessed the studies for eligibility, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias in each study. We assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADEpro software. RESULTS: A total of 10 studies (N = 14,967) were eligible. Compared with controls, glucocorticoids were not associated with reducing the risk of postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) (risk ratio [RR]: 0.79 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.41-1.55, P = .50, I2 = 85%), risk of postoperative delirium (POD) (RR: 0.87 95% CI: 0.74-1.03, P = .10, I2 = 36%), the length of stay in intensive care unit (ICU) (mean difference [MD] -0.21 95% CI: -1.20 to 0.79, P = .68, I2 = 84%), 30-day mortality (RR: 0.92 95% CI: 0.59-1.46, P = .73, I2 = 0%), or postoperative atrial fibrillation (RR: 0.94 95% CI: 0.86-1.01, P = .11, I2 = 25%). However, there was significant difference between glucocorticoids and control group in the length of hospital stay (LOS) (MD: -0.39 95% CI: -0.62 to -0.16, P = .001, I2 = 0%), and postoperative infections (RR: 0.65 95% CI: 0.56-0.76, P < .00001, I2 = 0%). CONCLUSIONS: Perioperative intravenous glucocorticoids did not reduce the risk of PND in adults after surgery but might be associated with shorter the LOS and lower the incidence of postoperative infections. More, larger, higher-quality RCTs including neurological surgery or hip fracture surgery and different doses of glucocorticoids compared with placebos are needed to explore the intervention effects.
