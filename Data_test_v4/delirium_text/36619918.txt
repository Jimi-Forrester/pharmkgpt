36619918|a|Objective: Age-related decline within the noradrenergic system is associated with reduced cognition. The beta-adrenoceptors are widely expressed in the brain as well as in the peripheral. Medications targeting beta-adrenoceptor activity have been widely used in older adults. The aim of this study was to explore the associations between beta-adrenoceptor acting drugs and the risk of dementia in the older population. Methods: The subjects' information was collected from the electronic medical record (EMR) database. A propensity score matching strategy was conducted to select control participants for users of beta2-agonists or beta-antagonists. Logistic regression analysis was performed to estimate the risk of dementia with the use of beta2-agonists or beta-antagonists. Results: A total of 1,429 participants in the EMR database were included in the study. The use of beta2-agonists was strongly associated with a decreased risk of dementia [OR = 0.324, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.149-0.707, P = 0.005]. This decreased risk showed a statistically significant inverse time-dependent pattern (P trend = 0.014). However, the use of non-selective beta-antagonists significantly correlated with an increased dementia risk (OR = 1.961, 95% CI: 1.144-3.359, P = 0.014), although no time-dependent manner was found (P trend = 0.220). There was no association between selective beta1-antagonists usage and dementia risk (OR = 1.114, P = 0.625). Conclusion: The use of beta-adrenoceptor acting drugs seems to be associated with the risk of dementia. Pharmacological interventions modulating beta2-adrenoceptor activity might be a potential target in therapeutics for dementia.
