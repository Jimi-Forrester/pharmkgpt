36982622|t|Antibody Assay and Anti-Inflammatory Function Evaluation of Therapeutic Potential of Different Intravenous Immunoglobulins for Alzheimer's Disease.
36982622|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disease that currently has no known cure. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), which contains AD-related antibodies and has anti-inflammatory properties, has shown potential as a treatment for AD. However, the efficacy of clinical trials involving AD patients treated with IVIG has been inconsistent. Our previous study found that different IVIGs had significantly varied therapeutic effects on 3xTg-AD mice. In order to investigate the relationship between the composition and function of IVIG and its efficacy in treating AD, we selected three IVIGs that showed notable differences in therapeutic effects. Then, the concentrations of specific antibodies against beta-amyloid (Abeta)42, tau, and hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau) in three IVIGs, as well as their effects on systemic inflammation induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in Balb/c mice, were analyzed and compared in this study. The results indicated that these IVIGs differed greatly in anti-Abeta42/tau antibody concentration and anti-p-tau ratio, and improved LPS-stimulated peripheral inflammation, liver and kidney injury, and neuroinflammation in Balb/c mice to varying degrees. Combined with our previous results, the efficacy of IVIG against AD may be positively correlated with its level of AD-related antibodies and anti-inflammatory ability. AD-related antibody analysis and functional evaluation of IVIG should be given sufficient attention before clinical trials, as this may greatly affect the therapeutic effect of AD treatment.
