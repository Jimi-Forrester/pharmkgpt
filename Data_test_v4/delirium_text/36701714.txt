36701714|t|A challenging case of lumbar vertebral burst fracture with alcohol withdrawal delirium: A case report.
36701714|a|BACKGROUND: Delirium tremens is a symptom of alcohol withdrawal syndrome that occurs 48 to 96 hours after the last drink in 5% of withdrawing patients. METHODS: This report describes the clinical progression of a case of lumbar vertebral burst fracture with alcohol withdrawal delirium that was difficult to manage. RESULTS: A 47-year-old man was rushed to our hospital complaining of lumbar back pain and numbness in both lower extremities resulting from a 6-m fall during civil engineering work. Computed tomography (CT) revealed a L1 burst fracture with a highly protruding bone fragment in the spinal canal. Magnetic resonance imaging disclosed significant compression of the conus and intramedullary signal changes. We immediately performed posterior spinal fusion and vertebroplasty using instrumentation. On the 4th postoperative day, he became severely agitated, as diagnosed as having delirium tremens related to alcohol withdrawal syndrome, and soon began appropriate medication with diazepam. Although his symptoms persisted until 6 days postoperatively, follow-up CT detected no evidence of screw loosening or breakage. CONCLUSION: We encountered a patient with severe delirium tremens developing several days after thoraco-lumbar fusion surgery. Prompt internal fixation successfully treated the spinal injury and prevented neurological damage. It may also be necessary to consider treatment strategies for patients with a background of heavy alcohol consumption in consideration of delirium tremens and other symptoms of alcohol withdrawal.
