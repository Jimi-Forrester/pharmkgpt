35906197|t|Functional characterization of FBXL7 as a novel player in human cancers.
35906197|a|F-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 7 (FBXL7), an F-box protein responsible for substrate recognition by the SKP1-Cullin-1-F-box (SCF) ubiquitin ligases, plays an emerging role in the regulation of tumorigenesis and tumor progression. FBXL7 promotes polyubiquitylation and degradation of diverse substrates and is involved in many biological processes, including apoptosis, cell proliferation, cell migration and invasion, tumor metastasis, DNA damage, glucose metabolism, planar cell polarity, and drug resistance. In this review, we summarize the downstream substrates and upstream regulators of FBXL7. We then discuss its role in tumorigenesis and tumor progression as either an oncoprotein or a tumor suppressor, and further describe its aberrant expression and association with patient survival in human cancers. Finally, we provide future perspectives on validating FBXL7 as a cancer biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis and/or as a potential therapeutic target for anticancer treatment.
