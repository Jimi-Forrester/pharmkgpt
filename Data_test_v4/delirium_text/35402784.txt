35402784|t|Post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC): a meta-narrative review of pathophysiology, prevalence, and management.
35402784|a|Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Over 220 countries and territories have been affected by this virus, and the infection rate has continued to rise. As patients recover from the virus, many are experiencing lingering symptoms. Understanding the impact of demographics and comorbidities on symptom prevalence, manifestations, and severity is not only relevant during acute infection, it is critical to the clinical management of patients with post-acute sequelae of COVID-19, also known as PASC. Herein, we provide a comprehensive review on the most recent research related to PASC. Specifically, we focus on the description of the disorder itself, compared to acute COVID-19, and which types of patients are most affected by long-term sequelae. Further, we share recommendations for management of the most common complications of PASC.
