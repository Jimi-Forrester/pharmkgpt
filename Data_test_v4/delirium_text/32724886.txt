32724886|t|Subtotal stomach in esophageal reconstruction surgery achieves an anastomotic leakage rate of less than 1%.
32724886|a|Aim: The objective of this retrospective, single-institution study was to assess the safety and feasibility of reconstruction using subtotal stomach (SS) with esophagectomy for patients with esophageal cancer (EC). Although several different gastric-tube-making and anastomotic methods have been reported, the incidence rate of anastomotic leakage with EC surgery is generally reported over 10%. Complications should be avoided, and patient quality of life (QOL) should be maintained postoperatively. We have used SS reconstruction and hand-sutured cervical esophagus-subtotal gastric anastomosis at the neck wound in EC surgery. Short- and long-term outcomes in cases using SS are not well known. Methods: Between January 2008 and September 2019, 300 patients underwent esophagectomy for EC and reconstruction using SS. The primary endpoint was the rate of anastomotic leakage. Secondary endpoints were postoperative morbidities, QOL, and changes in patients' body weight and skeletal muscle weight. Results: Anastomotic leakage was observed in two patients (0.67%), and pneumonia was observed in nine patients (3.0%). Fifteen patients (5.0%) had an anastomotic stenosis requiring a bougie. Nausea occurred in 11 patients (3.7%), and dumping syndrome occurred in seven patients (2.3%). Dysphagia and early feeling of abdominal fullness scores tended to be high after surgery but gradually decreased after 6 months. Good results were obtained for reflux feeling scores. Body weight changed with an average decrease of -2 +- 3.71 kg (P = .071) over 5 years. Conclusion: Reconstruction using SS resulted in an extremely low rate of anastomotic leakage and good QOL postoperatively in patients with EC.
