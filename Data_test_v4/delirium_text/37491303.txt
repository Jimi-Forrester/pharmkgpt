37491303|t|Standard versus innovative robotic balance assessment for people with multiple sclerosis: a correlational study.
37491303|a|INTRODUCTION: Balance disorders are common in people with Multiple Sclerosis (PwMS) and, together with other impairments and disabilities, often prevent PwMS from performing their daily living activities. Besides clinical scales and performance tests, robotic platforms can provide more sensitive, specific, and objective monitoring. Validated technologies have been adopted as gold standard, but innovative robotic solutions would represent an opportunity to detect balance impairment in PwMS. AIM: Study's aim was to compare postural assessment of 46 PwMS with a relapsing-remitting form during static tasks performed with the novel robotic platform hunova  and the gold standard EquiTest , METHODS: Pearson's r was run on Center of Pressure (COP)-related parameters and global static balance measures computed from hunova  and EquiTest  in eyes-open (EO) and eyes-closed (EC) conditions. In addition, agreeableness level toward the use of both devices was tested through numeric rating scale. RESULTS: Considering COP-related parameters, correlations were significant for all measures (p < .001). Interestingly, in EO, a strong correlation was shown for sway area (r = .770), while Medio-Lateral (ML) and Anterior-Posterior (AP) oscillation range, path length, ML and AP speed, ML and AP root mean square distance had a relatively strong association (.454 <= r <= .576). In EC, except for ML oscillation range showing a relatively strong correlation (r = .532), other parameters were strongly associated (.603 <= r <= .782). Correlations between global balance indexes of hunova  and EquiTest  revealed a relatively strong association between the Somatosensory Score in EquiTest  and the Somatosensory Index in hunova  (r = - .488). While in EO Static Balance Index from hunova  was highly correlated with Equilibrium score of EquiTest  (r = .416), Static Balance Index had a relatively strong association with both the Equilibrium (r = .482) and Strategy Score (r = .583) of EquiTest  in EC. Results from agreeableness rating scale revealed that hunova  was highly appreciated compared to EquiTest  (p = .044). CONCLUSIONS: hunova  represents an innovative adjunct to standard robotic balance evaluation for PwMS. This confirms that combining traditional and robotic assessments can more accurately detect balance impairments in MS.
