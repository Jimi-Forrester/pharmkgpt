17583861|a|INTRODUCTION: One of the most notable advances in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease today is the appearance of the drugs rivastigmine, donepezil, galanthamine and memantine. AIMS. We attempt to throw light on the dosage regimens, degree of effectiveness and safety profile of rivastigmine solution by means of a retrospective, descriptive, cross-sectional study known as the RIVASOL study. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study involved 1516 patients (1386 of whom were evaluable) who had been diagnosed with Alzheimer-type dementia (ATD) according to the criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition (DSM-IV); these patients, who were selected by 157 participating physicians (neurologists, psychiatrists and geriatricians), gave their informed written consent and had been receiving treatment with rivastigmine solution over the past six months. The main variable was the rivastigmine solution treatment regimen and the secondary variables included socio-demographic data, health care data and the researcher's overall clinical impression from the time treatment was begun, among others. RESULTS: Most of the patients who were evaluated were attended by neurologists (57.4%). The mean time elapsed since Alzheimer's disease was diagnosed was 2.14 +/- 1.68 years. After approximately one year's treatment with rivastigmine solution, the mean score on the Folstein minimental test (MMSE) fell by 0.48 points. CONCLUSIONS: Rivastigmine solution represents a convenient means of administration for patients with moderate and moderately advanced phases of ATD; their cognitive performance is significantly improved with a reduction in the side effects due to a slower and more progressive adjustment of the initial dosage.
