33917780|a|Background and Objectives: The role of physical activity (PA) in elderly patients admitted to surgical units for mild acute diverticulitis in the development of disability has not been clarified so far. Our aim is to demonstrate the relationship between physical activity and better post-discharge outcomes on disability in elderly population affected by diverticular disease. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed data of 56 patients (32 Males-24 females) collected from October 2018 and March 2020 at Cardarelli Hospital in Campobasso. We included patients older than 65 yrs admitted for acute bleeding and acute diverticulitis stage <=II, characterized by a good independence status, without cognitive impairment and low risk of immobilization, as evaluated by activity of daily living (ADL) and the instrumental activity of daily living (IADL) and Exton-Smith Scale. "Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly" (PASE) Score evaluated PA prior to admission and at first check up visit. Results: 30.4% of patients presented a good PA, 46.4% showed moderate PA and 23.2% a low PA score. A progressive reduction in ADL and IADL score was associated with lower physical activity (p value = 0.0038 and 0.0017). We consider cognitive performance reduction with a cut off of loss of more than 5 points in Short Port of ADL and IADL and a loss of more than 15 points on Exton-Smith Scale, (p-value 0.017 and 0.010). In the logistic regression analysis, which evaluated the independent role of PASE in disability development, statistical significance was not reached, showing an Odds Ratio of 0.51 95% CI 0.25-1.03 p value 0.062. Discussion: Reduced physical activity in everyday life in elderly is associated with increased post-hospitalization disability regarding independence, cognitive performance and immobilization. Conclusions: Poor physical performance diagnosis may allow to perform a standardized multidimensional protocol to improve PA to reduce disability incidence.
