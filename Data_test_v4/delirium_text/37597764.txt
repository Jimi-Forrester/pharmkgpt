37597764|a|As a classic animal model of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the 3 x Tg-AD mouse not only recapitulates most of anatomical hallmarks observed in AD pathology but also displays cognitive alterations in memory and learning tasks. The 3 x Tg-AD can better show the two characteristics of AD, amyloid beta (Abeta) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT). Therefore, 3 x Tg-AD strain is widely used in AD pathogenesis research and new drug development of AD. In this paper, the construction methods, pathological changes, and treatment characteristics of 3 x Tg-AD mouse models commonly used in AD research are summarized and commented, hoping to provide reference for researchers to choose and establish experimental patterns.
