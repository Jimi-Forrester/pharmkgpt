18522863|a|Recent studies highlight the prominent role played by estrogens in protecting the central nervous system (CNS) against the noxious consequences of a chronic inflammatory reaction. The neurodegenerative process of several CNS diseases, including Multiple Sclerosis, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Diseases, is associated with the activation of microglia cells, which drive the resident inflammatory response. Chronically stimulated during neurodegeneration, microglia cells are thought to provide detrimental effects on surrounding neurons. The inhibitory activity of estrogens on neuroinflammation and specifically on microglia might thus be considered as a beneficial therapeutic opportunity for delaying the onset or progression of neurodegenerative diseases; in addition, understanding the peculiar activity of this female hormone on inflammatory signalling pathways will possibly lead to the development of selected anti-inflammatory molecules. This review summarises the evidence for the involvement of microglia in neuroinflammation and the anti-inflammatory activity played by estrogens specifically in microglia.
