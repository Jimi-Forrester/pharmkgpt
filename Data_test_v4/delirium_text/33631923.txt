33631923|t|Evaluation of Nootropic Activity of Limonia acidissima Against Scopolamine-induced Amnesia in Rats.
33631923|a|OBJECTIVES: The present study aimed to evaluate the nootropic activity of Limonia acidissima in rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Methanolic extract of Limonia acidissima was used to evaluate nootropic activity, piracetam (200 mg/kg, i.p.) was used as a standard, and scopolamine (1 mg/kg, i.p.) was used to induce amnesia. The effect of drugs on learning and memory in rats was evaluated by using the Y-maze task and elevated plus maze on scopolamine-induced amnesia models. Locomotor activity was performed using an actophotometer. Also, levels of acetylcholinestrease, including histopathological examination of rat brains, were assessed. RESULTS: Methanolic extract of Limonia acidissima showed increased alteration of the behavior response and percentage spontaneous alteration with the Y-maze task. In the elevated plus maze scopolamine-induced amnesia model, methanolic extract of Limonia acidissima showed a decrease in transfer latency, which is indicative of cognition improvement. Methanolic extract increased locomotor activity in rats and decreased the levels of acetylcholinestrease enzyme significantly. A histopathological study with both low and high doses of extract showed effective regenerative scores as compared to normal control, negative control and standard treatment. CONCLUSION: The results suggested that the administration of methanolic extract of Limonia acidissima enhances learning and memory in different experimental models. The histopathological study revealed the neuroprotective property of the extract. The study indicates that the extract may be used in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
