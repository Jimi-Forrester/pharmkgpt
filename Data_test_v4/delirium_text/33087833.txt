33087833|a|Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is common in Parkinson's disease patients. However, its underlying mechanism is not well understood, which has hindered new treatment discoveries specific to MCI. The aim of this study was to investigate functional connectivity changes of the caudate nucleus in cognitively impaired Parkinson's patients. We recruited 18 Parkinson's disease patients-10 PDNC [normal cognition Parkinson's disease; Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) >= 26], 8 PDLC (low cognition Parkinson's disease; MoCA < 26) -and 10 age-matched healthy controls. All subjects were scanned with resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and perfusion MRI. We analyzed these data for graph theory metrics and Alzheimer's disease-like pattern score, respectively. A strong positive correlation was found between the functional connectivity of the right caudate nucleus and MoCA scores in Parkinson's patient groups, but not in healthy control subjects. Interestingly, PDNC's functional connectivity of the right caudate was significantly higher than both PDLC and healthy controls, while PDLC and healthy controls were not significantly different from each other. We found that Alzheimer's disease-like metabolic/perfusion pattern score correlated with MoCA scores in healthy controls, but not in Parkinson's disease. Increased caudate connectivity may be related to a compensatory mechanism found in cognitively normal patients with Parkinson's disease. Our findings support and complement the dual syndrome hypothesis.
