39451557|a|While Ginsenoside Re has been shown to protect the central nervous system, reports of its effects on memory in the model of scopolamine-induced memory impairment are rare. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of Ginsenoside Re on scopolamine (SCOP)-induced memory damage and the mechanism of action. Male ICR mice were treated with SCOP (3 mg/kg) for 7 days and with or without Ginsenoside Re for 14 days. As evidenced by behavioral studies (escape latency and cross platform position), brain tissue morphology, and oxidative stress indicators after Ginsenoside Re treatment, the memory damage caused by SCOP was significantly ameliorated. Further mechanism research indicated that Ginsenoside Re inhibited cell apoptosis by regulating the PI3K/Akt/Nrf2 pathway, thereby exerting a cognitive impairment improvement effect. This research suggests that Ginsenoside Re could protect against SCOP-induced memory defects possibly through inhibiting oxidative stress and cell apoptosis.
