35488342|t|Interaction between non-coding RNAs, mRNAs and G-quadruplexes.
35488342|a|G-quadruplexes are secondary helical configurations established between guanine-rich nucleic acids. The structure is seen in the promoter regions of numerous genes under certain situations. Predicted G-quadruplex-forming sequences are distributed across the genome in a non-random way. These structures are formed in telomeric regions of the human genome and oncogenic promoter G-rich regions. Identification of mechanisms of regulation of stability of G-quadruplexes has practical significance for understanding the molecular basis of genetic diseases such as cancer. A number of non-coding RNAs such as H19, XIST, FLJ39051 (GSEC), BC200 (BCYRN1), TERRA, pre-miRNA-1229, pre-miRNA-149 and miR-1587 have been found to contain G-quadraplex-forming regions or affect configuration of these structures in target genes. In the current review, we outline the recent research on the interaction between G-quadruplexes and non-coding RNAs, other RNA transcripts and DNA molecules.
