9413250|t|Guideline for initial evaluation of the patient with memory loss.
9413250|a|A practical and useful guideline for early identification of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias has been developed by the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research. By using the initial evaluation process described in this guideline, primary care physicians can identify and treat many "reversible" causes of memory problems, such as depression, delirium, and co-morbid medical conditions. The treatable causes of dementia may be structural, metabolic, toxic, infectious, nutritional, psychiatric, or drug-related. Initial evaluation includes patient history, physical examination, mental status testing, functional assessment, and some laboratory tests. Information from an informed family member can be very helpful in this process.
