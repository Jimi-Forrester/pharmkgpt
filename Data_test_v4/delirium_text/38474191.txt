38474191|t|Mitochondrial Dysfunction and Metabolic Reprogramming in Obesity and Asthma.
38474191|a|Mitochondrial dysfunction and metabolic reprogramming have been extensively studied in many disorders ranging from cardiovascular to neurodegenerative disease. Obesity has previously been associated with mitochondrial fragmentation, dysregulated glycolysis, and oxidative phosphorylation, as well as increased reactive oxygen species production. Current treatments focus on reducing cellular stress to restore homeostasis through the use of antioxidants or alterations of mitochondrial dynamics. This review focuses on the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in obesity particularly for those suffering from asthma and examines mitochondrial transfer from mesenchymal stem cells to restore function as a potential therapy. Mitochondrial targeted therapy to restore healthy metabolism may provide a unique approach to alleviate dysregulation in individuals with this unique endotype.
