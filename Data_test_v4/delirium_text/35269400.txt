35269400|t|FT-IR Spectral Signature of Sensitive and Multidrug-Resistant Osteosarcoma Cell-Derived Extracellular Nanovesicles.
35269400|a|Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common primary bone cancer in children and adolescents. Despite aggressive treatment regimens, the outcome is unsatisfactory, and multidrug resistance (MDR) is a pivotal process in OS treatment failure. OS-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) promote drug resistance to chemotherapy and target therapy through different mechanisms. The aim of this study was to identify subpopulations of osteosarcoma-EVs by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) to define a specific spectral signature for sensitive and multidrug-resistant OS-derived EVs. EVs were isolated from sensitive and MDR OS cells as well as from mesenchymal stem cells by differential centrifugation and ultracentrifugation. EVs size, morphology and protein expression were characterized. FT-IR/ATR of EVs spectra were acquired in the region of 400-4000 cm-1 (resolution 4 cm-1, 128 scans). The FT-IR spectra obtained were consistently different in the EVs compared to cells from which they originate. A specific spectral signature, characterized by a shift and a new band (1601 cm-1), permitted to clearly distinguish EVs isolated by sensitive and multidrug-resistant OS cells. Our data suggest that FT-IR spectroscopy allows to characterize and define a specific spectral signature for sensitive and MDR OS-derived EVs.
