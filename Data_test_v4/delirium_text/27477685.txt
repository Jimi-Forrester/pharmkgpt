27477685|a|This review describes recent developments in the search for effective therapeutic agents that target redox homeostasis in neurodegenerative disease. The disruption to thiol redox homeostasis in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple sclerosis is discussed, together with the experimental strategies that are aimed at preventing, or at least minimizing, oxidative damage in these diseases. Particular attention is given to the potential of increasing antioxidant capacity by targeting the Nrf2 pathway, the development of inhibitors of NADPH oxidases that are likely candidates for clinical use, together with strategies to reduce nitrosative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. We describe the shortcomings of compounds that hinder their progression to the clinic and evaluate likely avenues for future research.
