12742124|t|Development and validation of a liquid chromatographic-tandem mass spectrometric method for the determination of galantamine in human heparinised plasma.
12742124|a|Galantamine is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, recently approved for the treatment of mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease. To allow a higher throughput of samples, a new bioanalytical method for the determination of galantamine in human plasma was developed and validated. A stable isotope labelled internal standard was used. Sample preparation consisted of a simple one-step liquid-liquid extraction with toluene. The extracts were analysed with positive ion TurboIonspray tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS). The method was validated in the 1-500-ng/ml range. The accuracy, precision, selectivity, lower limit of quantification, upper limit of quantification, linearity and extraction recovery were evaluated, as well as the stability of the compound in plasma, blood, methanol and 2% BSA solutions under different conditions. The method proved very rugged during the analysis of large numbers of samples from clinical trials.
