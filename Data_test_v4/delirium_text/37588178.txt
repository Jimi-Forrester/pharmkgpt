37588178|t|Reduced excitatory neurotransmission in the hippocampus after inflammation and sevoflurane anaesthesia.
37588178|a|Background: Inflammation and general anaesthesia likely contribute to perioperative neurocognitive disorders, possibly by causing a neuronal imbalance of excitation and inhibition. We showed previously that treatment with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and sevoflurane causes a sustained increase in a tonic inhibitory conductance in the hippocampus; however, whether excitatory neurotransmission is also altered remains unknown. The goal of this study was to examine excitatory synaptic currents in the hippocampus after treatment with LPS and sevoflurane. Synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus, a cellular correlate of learning and memory, was also studied. Methods: Mice were injected with vehicle or LPS (1 mg kg-1 i.p.), and after 24 h they were then exposed to vehicle or sevoflurane (2.3%; 2 h). Hippocampal slices were prepared 48 h later. Excitatory synaptic currents were recorded from pyramidal neurones. Long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) were studied in the Schaffer collateral-cornu ammonis 1 pathway. Results: The amplitude of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) was reduced after LPS+sevoflurane (P<0.001), whereas that of spontaneous EPSCs was unaltered, as evidenced by cumulative distribution plots. The frequency, area, and kinetics of both miniature and spontaneous EPSCs were unchanged, as were LTP and LTD. Conclusions: The reduced amplitude of miniature EPSCs, coupled with the previously reported increase in tonic inhibition, indicates that the combination of LPS and sevoflurane markedly disrupts the balance of excitation and inhibition. Restoring this balance by pharmacologically enhancing excitatory neurotransmission and inhibiting the tonic current may represent an effective therapeutic option for perioperative neurocognitive disorders.
