19562484|a|Oxidative stress plays a pivotal role in normal brain aging and various neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Irreversible protein carbonylation, a widely used marker for oxidative stress, rises during aging. The temporal cortex is essential for learning and memory and particularly susceptible to oxidative stress during aging and in AD patients. In this study, we used 2-DE, MALDI-TOF/TOF MS, and Western blotting to analyze the differentially carbonylated proteins in the rat temporal cortex between 1-month-old and 24-month-old. We showed that the carbonyl levels of ten protein spots corresponding to six gene products: SOD1, SOD2, peroxiredoxin 1, peptidylprolyl isomerase A, cofilin 1, and adenylate kinase 1, significantly increased in the temporal cortex of aged rats. These proteins are associated with antioxidant defense, the cytoskeleton, and energy metabolism. Several oxidized proteins identified in aged rat brain are known to be involved in neurodegenerative disorders as well. Our findings indicate that these carbonylated proteins may be implicated in the decline of normal brain aging process and provide insights into the mechanisms underlying age-associated dysfunction of temporal cortex.
