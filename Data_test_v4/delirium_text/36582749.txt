36582749|a|Cryptococcosis has been recognized as an increasing cause of severe systemic mycosis in immunocompetent patients in the last few years. Cerebral cryptococcomas are a more uncommon manifestation of cryptococcal meningitis, which are not usually included in the differential of brain masses. We report a case of a young, immunocompetent woman that rapidly developed severe neurological deficits. She was ultimately diagnosed with cerebral cryptococcoma caused by both Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii, and was treated with amphotericin B and isavuconazole. After several complications during hospitalization, including hydrocephalus and cerebellitis, she was discharged home on isavuconazole. On follow-up, she only complained of anosmia. We review the clinical and radiological findings of similar cases. It is the first time that this form of cryptococcal meningitis is favorably treated with isavuconazole and is caused by 2 species of Cryptococcus. We emphasize that cerebral cryptococcomas should be suspected in immunocompetent patients that present with brain masses.
