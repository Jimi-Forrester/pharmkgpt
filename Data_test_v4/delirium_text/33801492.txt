33801492|a|Neuroinflammation is a crucial process to maintain homeostasis in the central nervous system (CNS). However, chronic neuroinflammation is detrimental, and it is described in the pathogenesis of CNS disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and depression. This process is characterized by the activation of immune cells, mainly microglia. The role of the orphan G-protein-coupled receptor 55 (GPR55) in inflammation has been reported in different models. However, its role in neuroinflammation in respect to the arachidonic acid (AA) cascade in activated microglia is still lacking of comprehension. Therefore, we synthesized a novel GPR55 antagonist (KIT 10, 0.1-25 microM) and tested its effects on the AA cascade in lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 10 ng / mL)-treated primary rat microglia using Western blot and EIAs. We show here that KIT 10 potently prevented the release of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), reduced microsomal PGE2 synthase (mPGES-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) synthesis, and inhibited the phosphorylation of Ikappa B-alpha (IkappaB-alpha), a crucial upstream step of the inflammation-related nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) signaling pathway. However, no effects were observed on COX-1 and -2 activities and mitogen-activated kinases (MAPK). In summary, the novel GPR55 receptor antagonist KIT 10 reduces neuroinflammatory parameters in microglia by inhibiting the COX-2/PGE2 pathway. Further experiments are necessary to better elucidate its effects and mechanisms. Nevertheless, the modulation of inflammation by GPR55 might be a new therapeutic option to treat CNS disorders with a neuroinflammatory background such as AD or depression.
