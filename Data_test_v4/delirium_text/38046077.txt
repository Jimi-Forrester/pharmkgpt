38046077|a|Background: The national hospital-acquired complications (HAC) system has been promoted as a method to identify health care errors that may be mitigated by clinical interventions. Objectives: To quantify the rate of HAC in multiday stay adults admitted to major hospitals. Design: Retrospective observational analysis of 5-year (July 2014 - June 2019) administrative dataset abstracted from medical records. Setting: All 47 hospitals with on-site intensive care units (ICUs) in the State of Victoria. Participants: All adults (aged >= 18 years) stratified into planned or unplanned, surgical or medical, ICU or other ward, and by hospital peer group (tertiary referral, metropolitan, regional). Main outcome measures: HAC rates in ICU compared with ward, and mixed-effects regression estimates of the association between HAC and i) risk of clinical deterioration, and ii) admission hospital site (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] > 0.3). Results: 211 120 adult ICU separations with mean hospital mortality of 7.3% (95% CI, 7.2-7.4%) reported 110 132 (42.6%) HAC events (commonly, delirium, infection, arrhythmia and respiratory failure) in 62 945 records (29.8%). Higher HAC rates were reported in elective (cardiac [50.3%] and non-cardiac [40.6%]) surgical subgroups compared with emergency medical subgroup (23.9%), and in tertiary (35.4%) compared with non-tertiary (22.7%) hospitals. HAC was strongly associated with on-admission patient characteristics (P < 0.001), but was weakly associated with hospital site (ICC, 0.08; 95% CI, 0.05-0.11). Conclusions: Critically ill patients have a high burden of HAC events, which appear to be associated with patient admission characteristics. HAC may an indicator of hospital admission complexity rather than hospital-acquired complications.
