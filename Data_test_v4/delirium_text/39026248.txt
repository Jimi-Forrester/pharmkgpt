39026248|t|Mechanisms of regulation of glycolipid metabolism by natural compounds in plants: effects on short-chain fatty acids.
39026248|a|BACKGROUND: Natural compounds can positively impact health, and various studies suggest that they regulate glucose-lipid metabolism by influencing short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). This metabolism is key to maintaining energy balance and normal physiological functions in the body. This review explores how SCFAs regulate glucose and lipid metabolism and the natural compounds that can modulate these processes through SCFAs. This provides a healthier approach to treating glucose and lipid metabolism disorders in the future. METHODS: This article reviews relevant literature on SCFAs and glycolipid metabolism from PubMed and the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC). It also highlights a range of natural compounds, including polysaccharides, anthocyanins, quercetins, resveratrols, carotenoids, and betaines, that can regulate glycolipid metabolism through modulation of the SCFA pathway. RESULTS: Natural compounds enrich SCFA-producing bacteria, inhibit harmful bacteria, and regulate operational taxonomic unit (OTU) abundance and the intestinal transport rate in the gut microbiota to affect SCFA content in the intestine. However, most studies have been conducted in animals, lack clinical trials, and involve fewer natural compounds that target SCFAs. More research is needed to support the conclusions and to develop healthier interventions. CONCLUSIONS: SCFAs are crucial for human health and are produced mainly by the gut microbiota via dietary fiber fermentation. Eating foods rich in natural compounds, including fruits, vegetables, tea, and coarse fiber foods, can hinder harmful intestinal bacterial growth and promote beneficial bacterial proliferation, thus increasing SCFA levels and regulating glucose and lipid metabolism. By investigating how these compounds impact glycolipid metabolism via the SCFA pathway, novel insights and directions for treating glucolipid metabolism disorders can be provided.
