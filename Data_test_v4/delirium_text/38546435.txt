38546435|t|Use of a Blood Biomarker Test Improves Economic Utility in the Evaluation of Older Patients Presenting with Cognitive Impairment.
38546435|a|More than 16 million Americans living with cognitive impairment warrant a diagnostic evaluation to determine the cause of this disorder. The recent availability of disease-modifying therapies for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is expected to significantly drive demand for such diagnostic testing. Accurate, accessible, and affordable methods are needed. Blood biomarkers (BBMs) offer advantages over usual care amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers in these regards. This study used a budget impact model to assess the economic utility of the PrecivityAD  blood test, a clinically validated BBM test for the evaluation of brain amyloid, a pathological hallmark of AD. The model compared 2 scenarios: (1) baseline testing involving usual care practice, and (2) early use of a BBM test before usual care CSF and PET biomarker use. At a modest 40% adoption rate, the BBM test scenario had comparable sensitivity and specificity to the usual care scenario and showed net savings in the diagnostic work-up of $3.57 million or $0.30 per member per month in a 1 million member population, translating to over $1B when extrapolated to the US population as a whole and representing a 11.4% cost reduction. Savings were driven by reductions in the frequency and need for CSF and PET testing. Additionally, BBM testing was associated with a cost savings of $643 per AD case identified. Use of the PrecivityAD blood test in the clinical care pathway may prevent unnecessary testing, provide cost savings, and reduce the burden on both patients and health plans.
