35729459|a|Central nervous system (CNS) involvement in dermatomyositis (DM) is seldom observed. However, there are very rare case reports of CNS involvement with juvenile dermatomyositis. Encephalopathy in DM may occur for a number of reasons, such as cerebral vasculitis and hypoperfusion/hypertensive encephalopathy, but mostly as a consequence of immunosuppressant treatment. We report here for the first time the case of a patient with two rare diseases, namely anti-MDA5 antibody-positive dermatomyositis and mild encephalopathy with reversible splenial lesion (MERS).
