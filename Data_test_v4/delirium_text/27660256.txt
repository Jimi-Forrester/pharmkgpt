27660256|t|Imaging for Quality Control: Comparison of Systematic Video Recording to the Operative Note in Colorectal Cancer Surgery. A Pilot Study.
27660256|a|BACKGROUND: Oncological and functional results after colorectal cancer surgery vary considerably between hospitals and surgeons. At present, the only source of technical information about the surgical procedure is the operative note, which is subjective and omits critical information. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of operative video recording in demonstrating both objective information concerning the surgical procedure and surgical quality, as using a systematic approach might improve surgical performance. METHODS: From July 2015 through November 2015, patients aged >=18 years undergoing elective colorectal cancer surgery were prospectively included in a single-institution trial. Video recording of key moments was performed peroperatively and analyzed for adequacy. The study cases were compared with a historic cohort. Video was compared with the operative note using the amount of adequate steps and a scoring system. RESULTS: This study compared 15 cases to 32 cases from the historic control group. Compared to the written operative note alone, significant differences in availability of information were seen in favor of video as well as using a combination of video plus the operative note (N adequate steps p = .024; p = <.001. Adequacy score: p = .039; p = <.001, both respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Systematic video registration is feasible and seems to improve the availability of essential information after colorectal cancer surgery. In this respect, combining video with a traditional operative note would be the best option. A multicenter international study is being organized to further evaluate the effect of operative video capture on surgical outcomes.
