9248779|t|The effect of velnacrine on the mixed function oxidase system.
9248779|a|Velnacrine is a centrally acting anticholinesterase which has been considered for use in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. If proven to be of value, it will be used concurrently with other medications. Its potential to cause interaction is, therefore, important to study. The aim of this work was to investigate velnacrine as an inhibitor of hepatic oxidative enzymes. The effects of velnacrine on antipyrine metabolism in isolated rat hepatic microsomes were compared to those of cimetidine. Aliquots of 200, 250 and 300 micrograms/ml antipyrine were incubated alone, with 20 micrograms/ml cimetidine and with each of 20, 50 and 100 micrograms/ml velnacrine. The concentrations of antipyrine and of its metabolites, 3-hydroxymethylantipyrine, 4-hydroxyantipyrine and norantipyrine were assayed by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography. Cimetidine inhibited production of all three metabolites. Velnacrine did not affect 3-hydroxymethylantipyrine production. Mean inhibition of 4-hydroxyantipyrine production of 15%, 30% and 25% (P < 0.01), and of 14%, 25% and 12% of norantipyrine production (P < 0.01) occurred. These results indicate that velnacrine may inhibit the enzymes responsible for the metabolism of antipyrine to norantipyrine and 4-hydroxyantipyrine. The clearance rate of drugs that are metabolised through the hepatic oxidase system may, therefore, be reduced in the presence of concurrent treatment with velnacrine.
