26608930|a|Amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide is the major constituent of the extracellular amyloid plaques deposited in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients and is central to the pathogenic pathway causing this disease. The identity of the neurotoxic Abeta species remains elusive. We previously reported that Abeta toxicity correlates strongly with its neuronal cell binding leading us to hypothesize that neuronal cell death is caused by the binding of a specific oligomeric Abeta species. To identify the specific oligomeric Abeta species that is associated with cell death, we treated mouse cortical neuronal cultures with synthetic Abeta40 and Abeta42 peptides and identified that the cellular Abeta binding and neurotoxicity were time and concentration dependent. We found a significant correlation between the amount of trimer and tetramer species bound to neurons with increasing neurotoxicity. We prepared Abeta40 oligomers (up to tetramers) using photo-induced cross-linking of unmodified peptides to confirm this oligomer-specific neurotoxic activity. Our results identify the Abeta tetramer, followed by the trimer, as the most toxic low-order oligomers Abeta species. Our findings suggested that binding of amyloid-beta (Abeta) tetramer and trimer, not monomer or dimer, to neurons is critical to induce neuronal cell death associated with Alzheimer's Disease. We proposed that Abeta trimer and tetramer are the potential neurotoxic Abeta species. This would provide more specific therapeutic target for Alzheimer's Disease.
