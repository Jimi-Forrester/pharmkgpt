33918664|a|Myelination by oligodendrocytes (OLs) is an important biological process essential for central nervous system (CNS) development and functions. Oligodendroglial lineage cells undergo several morphological and molecular changes at different stages of their lineage progression into myelinating OLs. The transition steps of the oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) to myelinating oligodendrocytes are defined by a specific pattern of regulated gene expression, which is under the control of coordinated signaling pathways. Any abnormal development, loss or failure of oligodendrocytes to myelinate axons can lead to several neurodegenerative diseases like multiple sclerosis (MS). MS is characterized by inflammation and demyelination, and current treatments target only the immune component of the disease, but have little impact on remyelination. Recently, several pharmacological compounds enhancing remyelination have been identified and some of them are in clinical trials. Here, we will review the current knowledge on oligodendrocyte differentiation, myelination and remyelination. We will focus on MS as a pathological condition, the most common chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease of the CNS in young adults.
