37185154|t|Associations of category fluency clustering performance with in vivo brain pathology in autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease.
37185154|a|OBJECTIVES: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is known to impact semantic access, which is frequently evaluated using the Category Fluency (Animals) test. Recent studies have suggested that in addition to overall category fluency scores (total number of words produced over time), poor clustering could signal AD-related cognitive difficulties. In this study, we examined the association between category fluency clustering performance (i.e., stating words sequentially that are all contained within a subcategory, such as domestic animals) and brain pathology in individuals with autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease (ADAD). METHODS: A total of 29 non-demented carriers of the Presenilin1 E280A ADAD mutation and 32 noncarrier family members completed the category fluency test (Animals) and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). The participants also underwent positron emission tomography (PET) scans to evaluate in vivo amyloid-beta in the neocortex and tau in medial temporal lobe regions. Differences between carriers and noncarriers on cognitive tests were assessed with Mann-Whitney tests; associations between cognitive test performance and brain pathology were assessed with Spearman correlations. RESULTS: Animal fluency scores did not differ between carriers and noncarriers. Carriers, however, showed a stronger association between animal fluency clustering and in vivo AD brain pathology (neocortical amyloid and entorhinal tau) relative to noncarriers. CONCLUSION: This study indicates that using category fluency clustering, but not total score, is related to AD pathophysiology in the preclinical and early stages of the disease.
