36350059|t|Site-Specific Phospho-Tau Aggregation-Based Biomarker Discovery for AD Diagnosis and Differentiation.
36350059|a|Tau aggregates are present in multiple neurodegenerative diseases known as "tauopathies," including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Pick's disease (PiD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and corticobasal degeneration (CBD). Such misfolded tau aggregates are therefore potential sources for tauopathy biomarker discovery. Using the tau antibody screening approach targeting high-molecular-weight misfolded tau aggregates, we tested several tau antibodies and a comprehensive set of site-specific phospho-tau (p-tau) antibodies targeting tau phosphorylation sites showing high frequencies in AD subjects. Our screens revealed that site-specific p-tau antibodies can not only differentiate AD from non-AD brains, but also discriminate AD from rare tauopathies PiD, PSP, and CBD brains. Differential detection of tau aggregates identified several novel p-tau sites as potential new biomarkers. As a proof-of-principle example, we showed that p-tau198 is a novel promising AD biomarker with sensitivity and specificity comparable with the existing biomarkers p-tau181 and p-tau217. Our results demonstrated that p-tau198 detection can not only differentiate AD from non-AD controls, but also diagnose AD from related 4R tauopathies PSP and CBD with AUCs of 0.96-0.99 (95% CI ranges from 0.90 to 1.00). Promisingly, p-tau198 was able to discriminate mild cognitive impairment from cognitively normal brains with an AUC of 0.75 (95% CI = 0.58-0.92). Our work provides a new avenue for developing diagnosis and differentiation tools for AD and related tauopathies.
