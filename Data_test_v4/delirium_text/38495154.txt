38495154|a|Purpose: Postoperative pain is prevalent and severe complication in elderly surgical patients. Multiple studies propose that a small dose of esketamine administered intraoperatively can alleviate postoperative pain and curtail opioid usage. We aimed to evaluate the impact of esketamine on postoperative acute pain among elderly patients with gastrointestinal tumors. Patients and methods: This is a prospective, parallel-group, randomized controlled trial. Ninety patients aged 60 and above, undergoing resection of gastrointestinal tumors, were randomly assigned to two groups: esketamine group (Group S, a single dose of 0.25 mg/kg and 0.1 mg/kg/h infusion) and control group (Group C, saline). Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) pain scores were the primary outcome. Remifentanil consumption, instances of rescue analgesia, delirium, sleep quality, postoperative recovery quality, serum levels of inflammatory cytokines, and adverse events within 72 h post-surgery were secondary outcomes, respectively. Results: Data of 87 of 99 eligible patients were analyzed. VAS scores at rest in Group S were lower than those in Group C at 6 h [1.2 (0.6, 1.6) vs 1.6 (1.0, 2.0), P = 0.003], 12 h [1.4 (1.0, 2.0) vs 2.0 (1.5, 2.0), P < 0.001], and 24 h [1.8 (1.3, 2.0) vs 2.2 (1.6, 2.6), P < 0.001] postoperatively. At 6 h post-surgery, VAS score during coughing was lower in Group S than Group C [2.0 (2.0, 2.3) vs 2.0 (2.0, 3.0), P = 0.009]. The instances of rescue analgesia were fewer in group S compared to group C (P = 0.007). Furthermore, the esketamine group showed improved sleep quality and QoR-15 score (P < 0.05) postoperatively. Conclusion: Intravenous administration of esketamine as an adjunct to general anesthesia can decrease the intensity of pain for 24 h without additional adverse effects after laparoscopic gastrointestinal tumor surgery.
