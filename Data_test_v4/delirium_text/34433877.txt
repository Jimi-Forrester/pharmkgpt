34433877|a|To describe clinical outcomes of patients aged 75 years and above after partial nephrectomy (PN), and to assess independent factors of postoperative complications. We retrospectively reviewed information from our multi-institutional database. Every patient over 75 years old who underwent a PN between 2003 and 2016 was included. Peri-operative and follow up data were collected. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to determine independent predictive factors of postoperative complications. We reviewed 191 procedures including 69 (40%) open-surgery, and 122 (60%) laparoscopic procedures, of which 105 were robot-assisted. Median follow-up was 25 months. The mean age was 78 [75-88]. The American Society of Anesthesiologist's score was 1, 2, 3 and 4 in 10.5%, 60%, 29% and 0.5% of patients respectively. The mean tumor size was 4.6 cm. Indication of PN was elective in 122 (65%) patients and imperative in 52 patients (28%). The median length of surgery was 150(+- 60) minutes, and the median estimated blood loss 200 ml. The mean glomerular filtration rate was 71.5 ml/minute preoperatively, and 62 ml/min three months after surgery. The severe complications (Clavien III-V) rate was 6.2%. On multivariate analysis, the robotic-assisted procedure was an independent protective factor of medical postoperative complications (Odds Ration (OR) = 0.31 [0.12-0.80], p = 0.01). It was adjusted for age and RENAL score, robotic-assisted surgery (OR = 0.22 [0.06-0.79], p = 0.02), and tumor size (OR = 1.13 [1.02-1.26], p = 0.01), but the patients age did not forecast surgical complications. Partial nephrectomy can be performed safely in elderly patients with an acceptable morbidity, and should be considered as a viable treatment option. Robotic assistance is an independent protective factor of postoperative complications.
