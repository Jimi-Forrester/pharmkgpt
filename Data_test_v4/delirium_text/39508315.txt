39508315|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is caused by a variety of factors, and one of the most important factors is gut microbiota dysbiosis. An imbalance in the gut mincrobiota have been shown to change the concentrations of lipopolysaccharide and short-chain fatty acids. These microorganisms synthesize substances that can influence the levels of a variety of metabolites and cause multiple diseases through the immune response, fatty acid metabolism, and amino acid metabolism pathways. Furthermore, these metabolic changes promote the formation of beta-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Thus, the microbiota-gut-brain axis plays an important role in AD development. In addition to traditional therapeutic drugs such as donepezil and memantine, traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) have also showed to significantly decrease the severity of AD symptoms and suppress the underlying related mechanisms. We searched for studies on the effects of different herbal monomers, single herbs, and polyherbal formulas on the gut microbiota of AD patients and identified the relevant pathways through which the gut microbiota affected AD. We conclude that improvements in the gut microbiota not only decrease the occurrence of inflammatory reactions but also reduce the deposition of central pathological products. Herbal monomers have a stronger effect on improving of central pathology. Polyherbal formulas have the most extensive effect on the gut microbiota in patients with AD. Among the effects of formulas, the anti-inflammatory effect is the most essential and is also the main concern regarding the use of TCMs in treating AD from the viewpoint of the gut microbiota. We hope that this review will be helpful for providing new ideas for the clinical application of TCMs in the treatment of AD.
