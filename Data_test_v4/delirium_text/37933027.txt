37933027|a|AIM: To explore the material basis of action of the Shuang Bai Su Qing recipe in the treatment of periodontitis using network pharmacology. METHODS: Using TCMSP, we screened the chemical components of 5 drugs. The components were input into the UniProt and PubChem databases to obtain target proteins; Genecards, Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM), and CEO databases were used to screen target proteins for periodontal disease. The targets were imported into the Cytoscape software to obtain intersecting targets, and conduct visual analysis to build the PPI network. The intersecting targets were then input into the Matescape database and subjected to biological process (BP) analysis, molecular function (MF) analysis, cell component (CC) analysis, and KEGG enrichment analysis. RESULTS: Twenty-seven TCM chemical components were obtained, with 198 target proteins associated with drugs and 2587 target proteins for periodontitis. Ten core targets were identified. Gene Ontology (GO) functional enrichment analysis yielded results for 20 BP, 11 MF, and 10 CC. KEGG analysis revealed that the main mechanisms of action were related to MAPK signaling pathway. Molecular docking results showed that luteolin strongly bind to TNF, IL6, and IL1B target proteins. CONCLUSION: The mechanism underlying the treatment of periodontitis with the recipe formula may be closely related to multiple targets in the MAPK signaling pathway.
