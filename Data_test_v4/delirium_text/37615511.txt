37615511|a|INTRODUCTION: Sepsis is a severe host response to infection, which induces both acute and long-term cognitive impairment. Despite its high incidence following sepsis, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive and effective treatments are not available clinically. AREA COVERED: This review focuses on elucidating the pathological mechanisms underlying cognitive impairment following sepsis. Specifically, the authors discuss the role of systemic inflammation response, blood-brain barrier disruption, neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, neuronal dysfunction, and Abeta accumulation and tau phosphorylation in cognitive impairment after sepsis. Additionally, they review current strategies to ameliorate cognitive impairment. EXPERT OPINION: Potential interventions to reduce cognitive impairment after sepsis include earlier diagnosis and effective infection control, hemodynamic homeostasis, and adequate brain perfusion. Furthermore, interventions to reduce inflammatory response, reactive oxygen species, blood-brain barrier disruption, mitochondrial dysfunction, neuronal injury or death could be beneficial. Implementing strategies to minimize delirium, sleep disturbance, stress factors, and immobility are also recommended. Furthermore, avoiding neurotoxins and implementing early rehabilitation may also be important for preventing cognitive impairment after sepsis.
