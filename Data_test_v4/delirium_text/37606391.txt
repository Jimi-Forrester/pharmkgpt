37606391|t|Persistent 18F-FDG Brain PET Fronto-Temporal Hypometabolism and Cognitive Symptoms Two Years after SARS-CoV-2 Infection: A Case Report.
37606391|a|At least 10% of patients experience persistent symptoms after SARS-CoV-2 infection, a condition referred to as post-acute COVID-19, post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), long COVID, long-haul COVID, long-term effects of COVID, post-COVID-19 and chronic COVID. In this report, we describe a case of persistent cognitive deficits developed after SARS-CoV-2 infection in a 40-year-old woman with a family history of early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) since her father was diagnosed with EOAD at the age of 50. We describe the clinical picture and workup, with special emphasis on the alterations of brain glucose metabolism evidenced by 18-fluoro-deoxy-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), which could be considered a useful marker of the presence and persistence of cognitive deficits.
