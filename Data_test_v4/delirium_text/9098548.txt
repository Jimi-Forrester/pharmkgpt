9098548|a|Recent studies indicate that the proto-oncogene Bax, and other related proteins (eg Bcl-2) may play a major role in determining whether cells will undergo apoptosis under conditions which promote cell death. Increased expression of Bax has been found to promote apoptosis, while over-expression of Bcl-2 can inhibit apoptosis. To investigate the role of Bax in nerve cell death in the rat brain we examined the level of Bax expression in cells undergoing apoptosis, using a hypoxic-ischemic stroke model. We found that Bax was expressed at high levels in the nuclei of neurons in the hippocampus, cortex, cerebellum, and striatum on the control side, and that Bax levels increased in hippocampal neurons undergoing apoptosis on the stroke side, and then declined (correlating with cell loss). In the Alzheimer's disease hippocampi we found a concentrated localisation of Bax in senile plaques, which correlated with the localisation of beta-amyloid protein in adjacent sections from the same brains. beta-Amyloid positive plaques are thought to contribute to the Alzheimer's disease process, possibly via an apoptotic mechanism, and this may occur via an increase in Bax in these areas. Bax was also strongly stained in tau-positive tangles in Alzheimer's disease hippocampi, suggesting Bax may play a role in tangle formation. In addition, we observed a loss of Bax expression in the dentate granule cells of Alzheimer's disease hippocampi compared with moderate Bax expression in control hippocampi, and this loss may be related to the survival of these neurons in Alzheimer's disease. Finally, we observed substantially different staining patterns of Bax using three different commercially available antisera to Bax, indicating the need for caution when interpreting results in this area.
