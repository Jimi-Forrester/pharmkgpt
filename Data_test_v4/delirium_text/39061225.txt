39061225|t|Immune-Related Adverse Events Induced by Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors and CAR-T Cell Therapy: A Comprehensive Imaging-Based Review.
39061225|a|Immunotherapy has revolutionized oncology care, improving patient outcomes in several cancers. However, these therapies are also associated with typical immune-related adverse events due to the enhanced inflammatory and immune response. These toxicities can arise at any time during treatment but are more frequent within the first few months. Any organ and tissue can be affected, ranging from mild to life-threatening. While some manifestations are common and more often mild, such as dermatitis and colitis, others are rarer and more severe, such as myocarditis. Management depends on the severity, with treatment being held for >grade 2 toxicities. Steroids are used in more severe cases, and immunosuppressive treatment may be considered for non-responsive toxicities, along with specific organ support. A multidisciplinary approach is mandatory for prompt identification and management. The diagnosis is primarily of exclusion. It often relies on imaging features, and, when possible, cytologic and/or pathological analyses are performed for confirmation. In case of clinical suspicion, imaging is required to assess the presence, extent, and features of abnormalities and to evoke and rule out differential diagnoses. This imaging-based review illustrates the diverse system-specific toxicities associated with immune checkpoint inhibitors and chimeric antigen receptor T-cells with a multidisciplinary perspective. Clinical characteristics, imaging features, cytological and histological patterns, as well as the management approach, are presented with insights into radiological tips to distinguish these toxicities from the most important differential diagnoses and mimickers-including tumor progression, pseudoprogression, inflammation, and infection-to guide imaging and clinical specialists in the pathway of diagnosing immune-related adverse events.
