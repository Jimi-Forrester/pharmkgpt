39573868|a|BACKGROUND: Evidence supports the neuroprotective effects of physical activity, either in experimental animal models or humans. However, the biological mechanisms by which physical exercise modulates dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression are still unclear. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated whether long-term (6 months) of voluntary wheel running induces neuroprotective effects in the pathogenesis of AD in middle-aged (8 months) female mice, focusing on energy metabolism. METHODS: A genetic mice model of AD (3xTg-AD) that performed wheel running presented changes in body metabolism and muscle oxidative profile, as well as restored discriminative and non-associative retention memories, evaluated by novel object recognition and open field tasks, respectively. RESULTS: In the hippocampus, these mice exhibited reduced levels of amyloidogenic AbetaPPbeta fragment, phospho-Tau protein and phospho-Akt (activated form), without changes in phospho-AMPK (activated form). In addition, hippocampal mitochondria presented a restored respiratory function, characterized by lower coupling degree and weak contribution from complex I found in 3xTg-AD mice. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrated that voluntary exercise improves cognitive parameters and biochemical hallmarks of AD, modulates Akt activation and enhances mitochondrial energy metabolism in hippocampus of middle-aged 3xTg-AD female mice, thereby reinforcing the neuroprotective role of physical exercise and the involvement of mitochondria in the etiology of the AD.
