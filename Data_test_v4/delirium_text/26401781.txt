26401781|t|APOE Genotype Affects Cognitive Training Response in Healthy Shanghai Community-Dwelling Elderly Individuals.
26401781|a|BACKGROUND: Cognitive training may contribute to the ability to maintain cognitive function in healthy elderly adults. Whether genotype modifies training effects remains unknown. OBJECTIVE: Assess influence of APOE on cognitive function over time in community-dwelling elderly adults participating in multi-domain cognitive training. METHODS: Healthy individuals >=70 years of age were screened from one urban community in Shanghai. 145 healthy Chinese older adults met inclusion criteria and were assigned to intervention (n = 88) or control (n = 57) groups. Multi-domain cognitive training involved 24 sessions of different content taking place over 12 weeks. Neuropsychological testing was administered at baseline, immediately after training, six months and twelve months post-intervention; composite measures of cognitive function were identified via factor analysis. RESULTS: Three factors explained the majority of variance in function (verbal memory, processing speed, executive function). The intervention attenuated 12-month declines in processing speed, regardless of APOE genotype (p = 0.047). Executive function declined in APOEe4 carriers over 12 months, regardless of intervention (p = 0.056). There was a significant interaction after 12 months where intervention e4 carriers had better processing speed than e4 controls (p = 0.003). Intervention e2 carriers had better executive function immediately after training (p = 0.02) and had better verbal memory 6-months post-intervention (p = 0.04). These effects remained significant after false-discovery rate correction. CONCLUSION: Multi-domain cognitive training reduces declines in processing speed over time. APOEe4 is associated with reductions in executive function over time, and training may attenuate e4-associated declines in processing speed. APOEe2 carriers may also benefit from training, particularly on measures of executive function and verbal memory.
