24376154|t|Neuroblastoma and pediatric delirium: a case series.
24376154|a|Delirium occurs frequently in critically ill children, and children with neuroblastoma may be at particular risk. Early diagnosis and treatment may improve short- and long-term outcomes. In this case series, we present four critically ill children with neuroblastoma who were diagnosed with delirium in the post-operative period. In all four patients, the diagnosis of delirium facilitated targeted intervention and improvement. Heightened awareness by pediatric oncologists, surgeons, and intensivists may lead to earlier diagnosis and improvement in clinical outcomes.
