35512064|t|The clinical efficacy of integrated care in combination with vasopressin for cardiogenic shock induced by acute myocardial infarction: A randomized controlled study protocol.
35512064|a|BACKGROUND: Cardiogenic shock (CS) is the most serious complication of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) with high mortality, and the conventional nursing mode can not meet the clinical needs. Studies have shown that integrated care model has advantages for critical and chronic diseases. However, there is no clinical study to evaluate the clinical efficacy of this nursing model on cardiogenic shock induced by acute myocardial infarction (CS-AMI). METHODS: This is a prospective randomized controlled trial to study the clinical efficacy of integrated care combined with vasopressin in the treatment of CS-AMI. Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive integrated care combined with vasopressin in the treatment group and conventional care combined with vasopressin in the control group. The patients will be followed up for 3 months after systematic treatment. Observation indicators include: length of hospital stay, quality of life score, blood pressure level, and nursing satisfaction score. Finally, SPASS 20.0 software will be used for statistical analysis of the data. DISCUSSION: This study will evaluate the clinical efficacy of integrated nursing combined with vasopressin in the treatment of CS-AMI. The results of this study will provide a reference for selecting appropriate nursing programs for CS-AMI patients. TRIAL REGISTRATION: OSF Registration number: DOI 10.17605/OSF.IO/K8CN4.
