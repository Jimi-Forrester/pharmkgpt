39482092|t|Serum Albumin Level at Intensive Care Unit Admission and Delirium Duration and Severity in Critically Ill Adults.
39482092|a|BACKGROUND: Hypoalbuminemia has been associated with an increased risk of in-hospital delirium. However, the relationship between serum albumin levels and the duration and severity of delirium is not well defined. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between albumin levels and delirium duration and severity. METHODS: Study data were from a randomized controlled trial involving adult intensive care unit patients (>= 18 years old) admitted to 3 academic hospitals from 2009 to 2015 who had positive delirium screening results on the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit-7. Delirium severity was defined by mean Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit-7 scores by day 8. Delirum duration was defined by the number of delirium-free and coma-free days by day 8. Serum albumin levels within 72 hours of intensive care unit admission were collected from electronic medical records. RESULTS: The study included 237 patients (mean age, 60.3 years; female sex, 52.7%; receiving mechanical ventilation, 59.5%; acute respiratory failure or sepsis, 57.8%). Serum albumin levels were categorized as 3 g/dL or greater (n = 13), 2.5 to 2.99 g/dL (n = 142), and less than 2.5 g/dL (n = 82). After adjustment for demographic and clinical characteristics, no significant associations between albumin levels and delirium duration or severity were found. However, patients with normal albumin levels (>=3 g/dL) had shorter stays than did patients with hypoalbuminemia. CONCLUSION: In patients with delirium, higher albumin levels were associated with shorter hospital stays but not with delirium duration or severity.
