30833322|t|Risk of dementia after Parkinson's disease in Taiwan: a population-based retrospective cohort study using National Health Insurance claims.
30833322|a|OBJECTIVES: A nationwide cohort study on the risk of dementia onset after first diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) is lacking. This study aims to assess 11 years of incidence and the HRs for developing dementia in patients with PD compared with matched controls. DESIGN: A population-based cohort study. SETTING: National Health Insurance database in Taiwan. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 5932 patients with PD were identified, and 29 645 age-matched, sex-matched and index year-matched PD-free individuals were randomly selected. OUTCOME MEASURES: All subjects were linked to the claim data to identify the first diagnosis of dementia. The Poisson assumption was used to estimate the incidence rate. Cause-specific hazards models with a partitioning of time at 1 year to account for proportionality were used to estimate the risk of dementia onset. RESULTS: The median duration from the first diagnosis of PD to the development of dementia was 9.02 years. In the first partition (  1 year), the incidence of dementia in the PD and control groups was 114.49 and 9.76 per 1000 person-years, respectively, with an adjusted HR of 6.43 (95% CI 5.46 to 7.57). In the second partition (>1 year), the incidence of dementia in the PD and control groups was 30.99 and 10.83 per 1000 person-years, with an adjusted HR of 2.42 (95% CI 2.23 to 2.61). Notably, in the second partition, both men and women aged <70 years had the highest HR (3.82, 95% CI 2.79 to 5.22 and 4.27, 95% CI 3.25 to 5.63, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: This study noted an increased risk of dementia after a diagnosis of PD. The magnitude of effect estimation was higher in men in the first partition but was similar in both genders in the second partition. PD patients aged <70 years have the highest risk of dementia in any given partition time.
