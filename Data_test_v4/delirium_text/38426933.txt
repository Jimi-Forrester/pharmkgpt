38426933|a|Chemical modifications in RNAs play crucial roles in diversifying their structures and regulating numerous biochemical processes. Since the 1990s, several hydrophobic prenyl-modifications have been discovered in various RNAs. Prenyl groups serve as precursors for terpenes and many other biological molecules. The processes of prenylation in different macromolecules have been extensively studied. We introduce here a novel chemical biology toolkit that not only labels i6A, a prenyl-modified RNA residue, by leveraging the unique reactivity of the prenyl group, but also provides a general strategy to incorporate fluorescence functionalities into RNAs for molecular tracking purposes. Our findings revealed that iodine-mediated cyclization reactions of the prenyl group occur rapidly, transforming i6A from a hydrogen-bond acceptor to a donor. Based on this reactivity, we developed an Iodine-Mediated Cyclization and Reverse Transcription (IMCRT) tRNA-seq method, which can profile all nine endogenous tRNAs containing i6A residues in Saccharomyces cerevisiae with single-base resolution. Furthermore, under stress conditions, we observed a decline in i6A levels in budding yeast, accompanied by significant decrease of mutation rate at A37 position. Thus, the IMCRT tRNA-seq method not only permits semi-quantification of i6A levels in tRNAs but also holds potential for transcriptome-wide detection and analysis of various RNA species containing i6A modifications.
