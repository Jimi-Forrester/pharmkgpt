31867220|a|Monocrotophos (MCP) is an organophosphate mainly used as insecticides in agriculture, and veterinary practice to control pests. Exposure to MCP is known to induce significant systemic toxicity in animals and humans. Short term exposure to a high dose of MCP has been reported to cause systemic toxicity, however limited information is available regarding low dose long term exposure in rats. We studied the effects of low dose long term exposure to MCP on oxidative/nitrosative stress, cholinesterase activity and neuronal loss in rat. Male rats were exposed to MCP (0.1 mug or 1 mug/ml) via drinking water for 8 weeks. The pro-oxidant markers such as reactive oxygen species (ROS), lipid peroxidation (MDA), nitrite level and antioxidant markers such as reduced glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and inhibition of cholinesterase activities were measured to evaluate the effects of MCP on brain along with plasma cholinesterase activity. Neuronal loss was analyzed in cortical region using H&E stained slices. The results suggested that exposure to MC even at the low dose, increased reactive oxygen species, thiobarbituric acid reactive substance levels and decreased glutathione, superoxide dismutase, catalase and cholinesterase activities in brain. No significant effect however, was observed on nitrite levels. Histological analysis revealed that low dose MCP exposure lead to structural changes in the cortical neurons in rats. It can be concluded from the study that low dose long term exposure (lower than No Observed Effect Level) of MCP may lead to the generation of oxidative stress by elevation of pro-oxidants markers and depletion of antioxidant enzymes markers along with inhibition of cholinesterase activity. These changes might thus be considered as the possible mechanism of cortical neuronal loss in these animals.
