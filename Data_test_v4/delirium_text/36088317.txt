36088317|a|BACKGROUND: Concurrent variation in adiposity and inflammation suggests potential shared functional pathways and pleiotropic disease underpinning. Yet, exploration of pleiotropy in the context of adiposity-inflammation has been scarce, and none has included self-identified Hispanic/Latino populations. Given the high level of ancestral diversity in Hispanic American population, genetic studies may reveal variants that are infrequent/monomorphic in more homogeneous populations. METHODS: Using multi-trait Adaptive Sum of Powered Score (aSPU) method, we examined individual and shared genetic effects underlying inflammatory (CRP) and adiposity-related traits (Body Mass Index [BMI]), and central adiposity (Waist to Hip Ratio [WHR]) in HLA participating in the Population Architecture Using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) cohort (N = 35,871) with replication of effects in the Cameron County Hispanic Cohort (CCHC) which consists of Mexican American individuals. RESULTS: Of the > 16 million SNPs tested, variants representing 7 independent loci were found to illustrate significant association with multiple traits. Two out of 7 variants were replicated at statistically significant level in multi-trait analyses in CCHC. The lead variant on APOE (rs439401) and rs11208712 were found to harbor multi-trait associations with adiposity and inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: Results from this study demonstrate the importance of considering pleiotropy for improving our understanding of the etiology of the various metabolic pathways that regulate cardiovascular disease development.
