39638823|t|Identification of AChE targeted therapeutic compounds for Alzheimer's disease: an in-silico study with DFT integration.
39638823|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative condition marked by cognitive deterioration and changes in behavior. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE), which hydrolyzes acetylcholine, is a key drug target for treating AD. This research aimed to identify new AChE inhibitors using the IMPPAT database. We used known drugs as a basis to search for similar chemicals in the IMPPAT database and created a library of 127 plant-based compounds. Initial screening of these compounds was performed using molecular docking, followed by an analysis of their drug-likeness and ADMET properties. Compounds with favorable properties underwent density functional theory (DFT) calculations to assess their electronic properties such as HOMO-LUMO gap, electron density, and molecular orbital distribution. These descriptors provided insights into each compound's reactivity, stability, and binding potential with AChE. Promising candidates were further evaluated through molecular dynamics (MD) simulations over 100 ns and MMPBSA analysis for the last 30 ns. Two compounds, Biflavanone (IMPHY013027) with a binding free energy of - 130.394 kcal/mol and Calomelanol J (IMPHY007737) with - 107.908 kcal/mol, demonstrated strong binding affinities compared to the reference molecule HOR, which has a binding free energy of - 105.132 kcal/mol. These compounds exhibited promising drug-ability profiles in both molecular docking and MD simulations, indicating their potential as novel AChE inhibitors for AD treatment. However, further experimental validation is necessary to verify their effectiveness and safety.
