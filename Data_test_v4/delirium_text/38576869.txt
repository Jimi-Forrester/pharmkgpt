38576869|t|The role of neurovascular coupling dysfunction in cognitive decline of diabetes patients.
38576869|a|Neurovascular coupling (NVC) is an important mechanism to ensure adequate blood supply to active neurons in the brain. NVC damage can lead to chronic impairment of neuronal function. Diabetes is characterized by high blood sugar and is considered an important risk factor for cognitive impairment. In this review, we provide fMRI evidence of NVC damage in diabetic patients with cognitive decline. Combined with the exploration of the major mechanisms and signaling pathways of NVC, we discuss the effects of chronic hyperglycemia on the cellular structure of NVC signaling, including key receptors, ion channels, and intercellular connections. Studying these diabetes-related changes in cell structure will help us understand the underlying causes behind diabetes-induced NVC damage and early cognitive decline, ultimately helping to identify the most effective drug targets for treatment.
