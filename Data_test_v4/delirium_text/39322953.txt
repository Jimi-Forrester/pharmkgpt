39322953|a|BACKGROUND: Several blood-based biomarkers offer the opportunity of in vivo detection of brain pathology and neurodegeneration in Alzheimer disease with high specificity and sensitivity, but the performance of amyloid-beta (Abeta) measurements remains under evaluation. Autosomal dominant Alzheimer disease (ADAD) with mutations in PSEN1, PSEN2 and APP can be studied as a model for sporadic Alzheimer disease. However, clarifying the genetic effects on the Abeta-levels in different matrices such as cerebrospinal fluid or plasma is crucial for generalizability and utility of data. We aimed to explore plasma Abeta concentrations over the Alzheimer disease continuum in a longitudinal cohort of genetic Alzheimer disease. METHODS: 92 plasma samples were collected from at-risk individuals (n = 47) in a Swedish cohort of ADAD, including 18 mutation carriers (13 APPswe (p.KM670/671NL) MC), 5 PSEN1 (p.H163Y) MC) and 29 non-carriers (NC) as the reference group. Concentrations of Abeta1-38, Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42 were analyzed in plasma using immunoprecipitation coupled to tandem liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (IP-LC-MS/MS). Cross-sectional and repeated-measures data analyses were investigated family-wise, applying non-parametric tests as well as mixed-effects models. RESULTS: Cross-sectional analysis at baseline showed more than a 3-fold increase in all plasma Abeta peptides in APPswe MC, regardless of clinical status, compared to controls (p < 0.01). PSEN1 (p.H163Y) presymptomatic MC had a decrease of plasma Abeta1-38 compared to controls (p < 0.05). There was no difference in Abeta1-42/1-40 ratio between APPswe MC (PMC and SMC), PSEN1 MC (PMC) and controls at baseline. Notably, both cross-sectional data and repeated-measures analysis suggested that APPswe MC have a stable Abeta1-42/1-40 ratio with increasing age, in contrast to the decrease seen with aging in both controls and PSEN1 (p.H163Y) MC. CONCLUSION: These data show very strong mutation-specific effects on Abeta profiles in blood, most likely due to a ubiquitous production outside of the CNS. Hence, analyses in an unselected clinical setting might unintentionally disclose genetic status. Furthermore, our findings suggest that the Abeta ratio might be a poor indicator of brain Abeta pathology in selected genetic cases. The very small sample size is a limitation that needs to be considered but reflects the scarcity of longitudinal in vivo data from genetic cohorts.
