20308786|a|Neurochemical Dementia Diagnostics (NDD), i.e., analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of amyloid-beta peptides and tau/phospho-tau proteins plays important role in the diagnosis of neurodegeneration and dementias. Several studies show alterations of these biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease (AD), however, only a few reports address alterations of other CSF biomarkers (albumin and immunoglobulins' quotients, cell count, lactate concentration, etc.) in the pathophysiology and diagnostic procedures of dementias. Therefore, we analyzed these biomarkers in patients diagnosed for dementia syndromes and carefully characterized with the state-of-the-art NDD analysis: Abeta1-42, Abetax-42, Abetax-42/x-40 ratio, tau, and ptau181. We found intrathecal IgG synthesis in 5 out of 112 patients showing alterations of the NDD biomarkers, and in four out of these five subjects, we could not find any satisfying reason for the intrathecal humoral response. In 25.9% of the patients with altered NDD biomarkers, we found an increased albumin quotient indicating a dysfunction of the blood-CSF barrier; however a similar figure of 25.2% was found in the group of patients without alterations in the NDD. Our findings suggest that at least some patients with increased CSF concentrations of tau/ptau proteins and decreased concentrations of Abeta{42} peptides show simultaneously CSF alterations found otherwise in neuroinflammatory processes. This, in turn, suggests that extended diagnosis should be performed in patients with "isolated" alterations of NDD biomarkers or intrathecal immunoglobulin synthesis.
