OBJECTIVE: To further explore this idea by investigating whether levels of Abeta42 and Abeta40 in retina are associated with corresponding levels in hippocampus, neuropathological assessments, apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype, and levels of islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP). METHODS: Levels of high molecular weight (HMW) Abeta42, Abeta40, and IAPP in ultra-centrifuged homogenates of retina and hippocampus from patients with AD, multiple sclerosis, AD with Lewy bodies, and non-demented controls were analyzed using Mesoscale Discovery electrochemiluminescence technology employing immunoassay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: Higher levels of retinal and hippocampal Abeta42-HMW, Abeta40-HMW, and IAPP-HMW were found in individuals with high neuropathological scores of Abeta plaques and in individuals carrying the APOEe4 allele. The retinal levels of Abeta42-HMW and Abeta40-HMW correlated with corresponding levels in hippocampus as well as with neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) and Abeta scores. Retinal IAPP-HMW correlated with retinal levels of Abeta42-HMW and with NFT and Abeta scores. CONCLUSION: These results show that different isoforms of Abeta can be detected in the human retina and moreover support the growing number of studies indicating that AD-related pathological changes occurring in the brain could be reflected in the retina.
