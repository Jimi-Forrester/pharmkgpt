39875069|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common central neurodegenerative disease in the world after Alzheimer's disease (AD), which mainly occurs in middle-aged and elderly people, and is increasing with the aging of the population. With the increasing incidence of PD, it is particularly important to explore its pathology and provide effective interventions and treatments. The pathogenesis of PD involves a variety of factors such as genetics, environment, and age, and is not yet fully understood. The main pathogenic mechanisms include neuronal degeneration, abnormal aggregation of alpha-synuclein, formation of Lewy bodies and oxidative stress, etc. In recent years, gene therapy, stem cell therapy, and immunotherapy, along with traditional drugs and surgical treatments, have become widely used. Currently, all treatments for PD are symptomatic and there is no radical cure. This paper reviews existing traditional and emerging treatments for PD to provide a theoretical basis for the in-depth study of PD pathogenesis and therapeutic approaches. Meanwhile, the application of gene editing and delivery, stem cell transplantation, immunotherapy and multi-target therapy laid the foundation for the development of safer, more effective and more comprehensive treatments for PD.
