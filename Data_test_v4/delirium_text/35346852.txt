35346852|t|Targeting brain Renin-Angiotensin System for the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's disease: Past, present and future.
35346852|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a well-known neurodegenerative disease characterized by the presence of two main hallmarks - Tau hyperphosphorylation and Abeta deposits. Notwithstanding, in the last few years the scientific evidence about the drivers of AD have been changing and nowadays age-related vascular alterations and several cardiovascular risk factors have been shown to trigger the development of AD. In this context, drugs targeting the Renin Angiotensin System (RAS), commonly used for the treatment of hypertension, are evidencing a high potential to delay AD development due to their action on brain RAS. Indeed, the ACE 1/Ang II/AT1R axis is believed to be upregulated in AD and to be responsible for deleterious effects such as increased oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, blood-brain barrier (BBB) hyperpermeability, astrocytes dysfunction and a decrease in cerebral blood flow. In contrast, the alternative axis - ACE 1/Ang II/AT2R; ACE 2/Ang (1-7)/MasR; Ang IV/ AT4R(IRAP) - seems to counterbalance the deleterious effects of the principal axis and to exert beneficial effects on memory and cognition. Accordingly, retrospective studies demonstrate a reduced risk of developing AD among people taking RAS medication as well as several in vitro and in vivo pre-clinical studies as it is herein critically reviewed. In this review, we first revise, at a glance, the pathophysiology of AD focused on its classic hallmarks. Secondly, an overview about the impact of the RAS on the pathophysiology of AD is also provided, focused on their four essential axes ACE 1/Ang II/AT2R; ACE 2/Ang (1-7)/MasR; Ang IV/ AT4R(IRAP) and ACE 1/Ang II/AT1R. Finally, the therapeutic potential of available drugs targeting RAS on AD, namely angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), is highlighted and data supporting this hope will be presented, from in vitro and in vivo pre-clinical to clinical studies.
