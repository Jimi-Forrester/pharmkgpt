32790788|t|RE-PERG in early-onset Alzheimer's disease: A double-blind, electrophysiological pilot study.
32790788|a|PURPOSE: To evaluate the ability of re-test pattern electroretinogram (RE-PERG), a non-invasive and fast steady-state PERG, to detect inner retinal bioelectric function anomalies in patients with early-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: The study population consisted of 17 patients with AD-related mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 16 patients with vascular dementia (VD)-related MCI, both assessed using the neuropsychological Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and by structural magnetic resonance imaging, and 19 healthy, age-matched normal controls (NC). All participants were visually asymptomatic, had normal or near-normal general cognitive functioning and no or minimal impairments in daily life activities. Visual field (VF) test, optical coherence tomography (OCT) and RE-PERG, sampled in five consecutive blocks of 130 events, were performed. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference among the three groups with respect to age, VF parameters (mean and pattern standard deviations) and OCT parameters (ganglion cell complex thickness and retinal nerve fiber layer thickness). The mean amplitude in the RE-PERG was significantly lower, but only weakly in the AD group than in NC (p = 0.1) whereas the intrinsic variability of the 2nd harmonic phase was significantly higher in the AD group than in either the VD or NC group (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: RE-PERG is altered in early-stage AD, showing a reduced amplitude with high intrinsic phase variability. It also allows the discrimination of AD from VD. A high intrinsic variability in the PERG signal, determined using RE-PERG, may thus be a new promising test for neurodegenerative diseases.
