38375233|t|Altered pubertal timing in 7q11.23 copy number variations and associated genetic mechanisms.
38375233|a|Pubertal timing, including age at menarche (AAM), is a heritable trait linked to lifetime health outcomes. Here, we investigate genetic mechanisms underlying AAM by combining genome-wide association study (GWAS) data with investigations of two rare genetic conditions clinically associated with altered AAM: Williams syndrome (WS), a 7q11.23 hemideletion characterized by early puberty; and duplication of the same genes (7q11.23 Duplication syndrome [Dup7]) characterized by delayed puberty. First, we confirm that AAM-derived polygenic scores in typically developing children (TD) explain a modest amount of variance in AAM (R2 = 0.09; p = 0.04). Next, we demonstrate that 7q11.23 copy number impacts AAM (WS < TD < Dup7; p = 1.2x10-8, eta2 = 0.45) and pituitary volume (WS < TD < Dup7; p = 3x10-5, etap2 = 0.2) with greater effect sizes. Finally, we relate an AAM-GWAS signal in 7q11.23 to altered expression in postmortem brains of STAG3L2 (p = 1.7x10-17), a gene we also find differentially expressed with 7q11.23 copy number (p = 0.03). Collectively, these data explicate the role of 7q11.23 in pubertal onset, with STAG3L2 and pituitary development as potential mediators.
