35667737|t|Postacute Sequelae of COVID-19 Critical Illness.
35667737|a|With an ever-increasing number of COVID-19 survivors, providers are tasked with addressing the longer lasting symptoms of COVID-19, or postacute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC). For critically ill patients, existing knowledge about postintensive care syndrome (PICS) represents a useful structure for understanding PASC. Post-ICU clinics leverage a multidisciplinary team to evaluate and treat the physical, cognitive, and psychological sequelae central to both PICS and PASC in critically ill patients. While management through both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic modalities can be used, further research into both the optimal treatment and prevention of PASC represents a key public health imperative.
