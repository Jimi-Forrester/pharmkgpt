347880|t|Interim report: high dosage bromperidol therapy of delirium tremens.
347880|a|The high dosage of bromperidol as used in this investigation was a safe and effective agent in the treatment of alcohol-induced delirium tremens. All of the 10 patients survived without having complications of the illness or side effects of the therapy. The high doses of bromperidol had a gradual effect against the ten target symptoms of delirium tremens. Particularly effective was the action of bromperidol in controlling hallucinatory phenomena. Against excitement and restlessness, it was rather less effective; no patients were oversedated. Supplementary sedative medication was only rarely needed.
