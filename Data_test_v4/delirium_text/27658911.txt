27658911|a|The ionizing radiation is a known carcinogen as well as cancer therapeutic agent however, the side effect on normal tissue is a limiting factor and inadequate doses necessitates search for an ideal radioprotective agent. Bamboo species are rich source of antioxidants hence have therapeutic value in many free radical mediated diseases. This is the first report regarding in vitro protective effect of bamboo leaf extract against radiation induced genetic damage in human peripheral blood lymphocytes by cytokinesis blocked micronuclei (CBMN) assay. Fresh whole blood was exposed to 5Gy of cobalt-6o gamma radiation with or without 30 min pre-treatment with 3 mul and 5 mul of hydro alcoholic leaf extract of Phyllostachys parvifolia. In addition to whole extract the effect of potential active compound orientin was also assessed. The frequency of radiation induced micronuclei decreased significantly in a dose dependent manner following treatment with whole extract as well as orientin. The extent of reduction in micronuclei frequency was higher with whole bamboo leaf extract as compared to orientin alone.
