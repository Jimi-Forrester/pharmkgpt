36421628|t|Turning Point of Cognitive Decline for Chinese Older Adults from a Longitudinal Analysis: Protective Factors and Risk Factors.
36421628|a|OBJECTIVES: To explore the turning point of cognitive decline in Chinese older adults and to explore the influencing factors including covariates. PARTICIPANTS: Aged 65 and older whose cognitive function was normal at their first test. METHODS: a secondary analysis that identified participants from the database of the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS). Cohort-sequential design was used to categorize the data by age (rather than study wave), including the follow-up data of Chinese older adults aged 65-79 years and spanning 14 years. Cognitive function in 1278 participants was assessed using the Chinese Mini-Mental State Examination (CMMSE) in five waves over 14 years. Piecewise latent growth curve modeling was used to analyze the data. RESULTS: (1) The turning point of cognitive decline in Chinese older adults occurs between the ages of 68 and 70. (2) There are statistically significant individual differences in the initial level of cognitive function and the growth rate of cognitive function before and after the transition stage. (3) Factors influencing cognitive function include residence, education level, smoking, drinking, exercise, leisure activities, social activities, Activities of Daily Living (ADL), and Instrumental Activities for Daily Living (IADL). (4) Exercise and ADL are the main protective factors, while smoking and drinking are the main risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: There is a transition stage (68-70) in the decline of cognitive function in Chinese older adults and four main factors (such as smoking, drinking, exercise and ADL) have impacts on the cognitive decline. We should strengthen these protective factors (exercise and ADL) for the cognitive decline of older adults and avoid these risk factors (smoking, drinking). To prevent the decline of the cognitive function of older adults, the government should build more places conducive to activities for older adults and actively encourage older adults to improve their physical activity level. Given our findings, public health interventions centered on alcohol and tobacco cessation in older adults should be governmentally endorsed.
