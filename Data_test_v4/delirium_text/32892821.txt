32892821|a|This review provides an overview for health care teams involved in the perioperative care of cardiac surgery patients. The intention is to summarize key determinants of delirium, its impact on short- and long-term outcomes as well as to discuss effective management strategies. The first component of this review examines the prevalence and the factors associated with an increased risk of postoperative delirium. A multitude of predisposing (eg, baseline vulnerability and comorbidities) and precipitating (eg, type of cardiac surgery and postoperative care) factors that contribute to the occurrence of delirium are discussed.
