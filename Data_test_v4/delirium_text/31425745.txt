31425745|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an important chronic neurodegenerative disorder and is mainly associated with cognitive dysfunction. At present, bioactive compounds from traditional medicinal plants have received much attention for the enhancement of cognitive function. Danshensu, a phenolic acid isolated from herbal medicines, has various pharmacological activities in the central nervous system, including anxiolytic-like and neuroprotective properties. The present study aimed to investigate the ameliorating effects of danshensu on scopolamine- and amyloid-beta (Abeta) protein-induced cognitive impairments in mice. Danshensu (3 and 10 mg/kg, p.o.) effectively ameliorated scopolamine-induced cognitive dysfunction in mice, as measured in passive avoidance and Y-maze tasks. In a mechanistic study, danshensu inhibited monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) activity but not MAO-B. Additionally, danshensu treatment increased the dopamine level and the phosphorylation levels of protein kinase A (PKA) and cAMP response element binding protein (CREB), in the cortex of the brain. Furthermore, the ameliorating effect of danshensu against scopolamine-induced cognitive impairment was fully blocked by H89, a PKA inhibitor. Finally, danshensu also ameliorated Abeta-induced cognitive impairments in an animal model of AD. The results revealed that danshensu treatment significantly improved scopolamine and Abeta-induced cognitive impairments in mice by facilitation of dopamine signaling cascade such as PKA and CREB due to MAO-A inhibition. Thus, danshensu could be used as a promising therapeutic agent for preventing and treating AD.
