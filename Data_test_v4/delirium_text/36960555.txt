36960555|t|Comparison of Migraine Characteristics in Patients With and Without Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Retrospective Cohort Study.
36960555|a|BACKGROUND: Survey studies have found an increased prevalence of migraine in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, the clinical characteristics of migraines in this population are unknown. We conducted a retrospective medical record review study to characterize migraines in the IBD population. METHODS: Six hundred seventy-five migraine patients (280 with IBD, 395 without IBD) who were evaluated at Mayo Clinic Rochester, Mayo Clinic Arizona, or Mayo Clinic Florida between July 2009 and March 2021 were included. Patients with ICD codes for migraine and either Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC) were selected. Electronic health care records were reviewed. Patients confirmed to have IBD and migraine were included. Demographic, IBD, and migraine characteristics were collected. Statistical analysis was completed using SAS. RESULTS: Patients with IBD were less often male (8.6% vs 21.3%, P < .001) and had a higher Charlson Comorbidity Index (>2: 24.6% vs 15.7%, P = .003); 54.6% had CD and 39.3% had UC. Patients with IBD had migraine with aura and without aura more frequently ( OR 2.20, P < .001 and OR 2.79, P < .001, respectively) than non-IBD patients. Additionally, those with IBD less commonly had chronic migraine (OR 0.23, P < .001) and less commonly had chronic migraine or treatment for migraine (ORs 0.23-0.55, P <= .002). CONCLUSIONS: Migraine with and without aura have increased prevalence in IBD patients. Further study of this topic will be helpful to clarify the prevalence of migraine, establish this population's response to treatment, and better understand the reason(s) for a low rate of treatment.
