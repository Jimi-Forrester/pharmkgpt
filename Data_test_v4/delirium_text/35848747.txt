SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Perioperative neurocognitive disorders include delayed neurocognitive recovery (dNCR). The contribution of olfactory function to dNCR remains undetermined. It is unknown whether odor enrichment could mitigate dNCR. METHODS: We performed a prospective observational cohort study to determine potential association between olfactory impairment and dNCR in patients. We assessed the effects of anesthesia/surgery on olfactory and cognitive function in mice using the block test and Barnes maze. We measured interleukin-6, olfactory mature protein, GAP43, mature and premature olfactory neurons, PSD-95, and synaptophysin in blood, nasal epithelium, and hippocampus of mice. Odor enrichment, interleukin-6 antibody, and knockout of interleukin-6 were used in the interaction experiments. RESULTS: Patients with dNCR had worse odor identification than the patients without dNCR [preoperative: 7 (1.25, 9) versus 10 (8, 11), median (interquartile range), P<0.001; postoperative: 8 (2.25, 10) versus 10 (8, 11), P<0.001]. Olfactory impairment associated with dNCR in patients before and after adjusting age, sex, education, preoperative mini-mental state examination score, and days of the neuropsychological tests. Anesthesia/surgery induced olfactory and cognitive impairment, increased levels of interleukin-6 in blood and nasal epithelium, decreased amounts of olfactory receptor neurons and their markers in the nasal epithelium, and reduced amounts of synapse markers in the hippocampus of mice. These changes were attenuated by odor enrichment and interleukin-6 antibody. CONCLUSION: The anesthesia/surgery-induced olfactory impairment may contribute to dNCR in patients and postoperative cognitive impairment in mice. Odor enrichment could be a potential intervention.
