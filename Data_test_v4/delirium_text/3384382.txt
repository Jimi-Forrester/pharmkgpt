3384382|t|[Delirium syndrome in biperiden poisoning].
3384382|a|We report on two cases of self-induced intoxication with the anticholinergic agent biperiden (oral ingestion of at least 200 mgs. in case 1, and of 60 mgs. in combination with 300-400 mgs levomepromazine in case 2). An acute delirious state and other somatic symptoms of a toxic anticholinergic action dominated the clinical picture. Serial measurements of biperiden serum levels revealed values up to 50-fold (case 1) and 15-fold (case 2) of those usually observed under therapeutic doses of biperiden. In both cases, the intoxication was controlled by the application of physostigmine and general therapeutic measures. We discuss the prognosis of biperiden intoxications, and the clinical symptomatology and therapy of drug-induced anticholinergic syndromes.
