10927169|a|Oxidative stress has traditionally been viewed as a stochastic process of cell damage resulting from aerobic metabolism, and antioxidants have been viewed simply as free radical scavengers. Only recently has it been recognized that reactive oxygen species (ROS) are widely used as second messengers to propagate proinflammatory or growth-stimulatory signals. With this knowledge has come the corollary realization that oxidative stress and chronic inflammation are related, perhaps inseparable phenomena. New pharmacological strategies aimed at supplementing antioxidant defense systems while antagonizing redox-sensitive signal transduction may allow improved clinical management of chronic inflammatory or degenerative conditions, including Alzheimer's disease. Introduction of antioxidant therapies into mainstream medicine is possible and promising, but will require significant advances in basic cell biology, pharmacology, and clinical bioanalysis.
