39054562|a|BACKGROUND: With the popularization of robotic surgical systems in the field of surgery, robotic gastric cancer surgery has also been fully applied and promoted in China. The Chinese Guidelines for Robotic Gastric Cancer Surgery was published in the Chinese Journal of General Surgery in August 2021. METHODS: We have made a detailed interpretation of the process of robotic gastric cancer surgery regarding the indications, contraindications, perioperative preparation, surgical steps, complication, and postoperative management based on the recommendations of China's Guidelines for Robotic Gastric Cancer Surgery and supplemented by other surgical guidelines, consensus, and single-center experience. RESULTS: Twenty experiences of perioperative clinical management of robotic gastric cancer surgery were described in detail. CONCLUSION: We hope to bring some clinical reference values to the front-line clinicians in treating robotic gastric cancer surgery. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The guidelines were registered on the International Practice Guideline Registration Platform ( http://www.guidelines-registry.cn ) (registration number: IPGRP-2020CN199).
