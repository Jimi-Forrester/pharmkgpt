32676242|t|Cannabis-Induced Catatonia: A Case Series.
32676242|a|Catatonia is a psychomotor condition characterized by physical presentations ranging from severe immobility to excessive psychomotor agitation with an array of accompanying emotional aspects. Though initially thought to be a subform of schizophrenia, it is now recognized to be associated with many different psychiatric, neurological, and medical diagnoses. The emergence of catatonia is becoming more prevalent with its changing pattern and extensive use of recreational and illegal drugs. With the legalization of marijuana, its use is on the rise leading to several mental health conditions, including catatonia. If left untreated, catatonia has a significant morbidity and mortality rate; hence, prompt evaluation and diagnosis are critical for the prevention of adverse events. Benzodiazepines (BZDs) and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) have been found to be most effective and remained as the preferred treatment options. In this paper, we present the case of two patients who presented with catatonia after cannabis consumption and discuss their treatment course and management.
