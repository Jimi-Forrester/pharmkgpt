32231214|t|The depletion of ubiquilin in Drosophila melanogaster disturbs neurochemical regulation to drive activity and behavioral deficits.
32231214|a|Drosophila melanogaster is a useful and highly tractable model organism for understanding the molecular mechanisms of human diseases. We previously characterized a new dUbqn knockdown model that induces learning-memory and locomotive deficits mediated by impaired proteostasis. Although proteinopathies are the main causes of neurodegenerative diseases, limited information is currently available on the relationship between proteostasis and neurodegenerative-related behavioral perturbations, such as locomotion, wakefulness, and sexual activities. Thus, the present study aimed to elucidate the mechanisms by which dUbqn depletion which is known to cause proteinopathies, affects neurodegenerative-related behavioral perturbations. Pan-neuronal dUbqn-depleted flies showed significantly reduced evening activity along with altered pre- and postsynaptic structural NMJ's proteins by attenuating signals of Bruchpilot puncta and GluRIIA clustering. In addition, the neurochemical profiles of GABA, glutamate, dopamine, and serotonin were disturbed and these changes also affected courtship behaviors in dUbqn-depleted flies. Collectively, these results extend our understanding on how dUbqn depletion affects neurochemical regulation to drive behavioral disturbances that are generally found in the early stage of neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, the present study may contribute a novel finding to the design of new agents that prevent disease progression or even treat diseases related to neurodegeneration.
