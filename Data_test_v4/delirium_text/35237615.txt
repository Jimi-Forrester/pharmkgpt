35237615|a|Infectious etiologies and tumors are common triggers of autoimmune encephalitis. We herein reported a rare case of autoimmune encephalitis with multiple autoantibodies in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum, with concomitant human herpesvirus 7 (HHV-7) infection and ovarian teratoma. A 36-year-old woman presented with mental and behavioral changes and gibberish for 13 days, followed by fever for 1 day. Her brain MRI indicated limbic encephalitis. Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) of CSF revealed HHV-7. Antibody testing showed positive anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) and anti-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR) antibodies in CSF and serum. Ovarian teratoma was considered after pelvic MRI, which was then pathologically confirmed after laparoscopic ovariectomy. Her conditions improved after laparoscopic surgery, intravenous steroids, immunoglobulin, and rituximab therapy. Our findings suggested that the combination of multiple therapies including antiviral, immunotherapy, and resection of tumors were appropriate and improved the prognosis, when HHV-7 infection and ovarian teratoma were concomitant with multiple anti-neuronal antibodies of autoimmune encephalitis.
