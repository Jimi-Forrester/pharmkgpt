33014011|t|CrisPam: SNP-Derived PAM Analysis Tool for Allele-Specific Targeting of Genetic Variants Using CRISPR-Cas Systems.
33014011|a|Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) is a promising novel technology that holds the potential of treating genetic diseases. Safety and specificity of the treatment are to be further studied and developed prior to implementation of the technology into the clinic. The guide-RNA (gRNA) allows precise position-specific DNA targeting, although it may tolerate small changes such as point mutations. The permissive nature of the CRISPR-Cas system makes allele-specific targeting a challenging goal. Hence, an allele-specific targeting approach is in need for future treatments of heterozygous patients suffering from diseases caused by dominant negative mutations. The single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-derived protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) approach allows highly allele-specific DNA cleavage due to the existence of a novel PAM sequence only at the target allele. Here, we present CrisPam, a computational tool that detects PAMs within the variant allele for allele-specific targeting by CRISPR-Cas systems. The algorithm scans the sequences and attempts to identify the generation of multiple PAMs for a given reference sequence and its variations. A successful result is such that at least a single PAM is generated by the variation nucleotide. Since the PAM is present within the variant allele only, the Cas enzyme will bind the variant allele exclusively. Analyzing a dataset of human pathogenic point mutations revealed that 90% of the analyzed mutations generated at least a single PAM. Thus, the SNP-derived PAM approach is ideal for targeting most of the point mutations in an allele-specific manner. CrisPam simplifies the gRNAs design process to specifically target the allele of interest and scans a wide range of 26 unique PAMs derived from 23 Cas enzymes.
