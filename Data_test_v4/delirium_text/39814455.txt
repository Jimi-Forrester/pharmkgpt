39814455|t|Efficacy of light-transmitting eye shields for wound dressing in preventing pediatric emergence agitation following bilateral strabismus surgeries: a randomized clinical trial.
39814455|a|Background: Emergence agitation (EA) occurs in preschool children after ophthalmic surgery as eye shields induce visual disturbance. We aimed to investigate the efficacy of light-transmitting eye shields as an alternative to traditional medical gauze eye shields for wound dressing in terms of EA incidence following strabismus surgery. Methods: We randomly assigned 70 preschool children undergoing bilateral strabismus surgery to receive either light-transmitting (LT group, n = 35) or medical gauze (MG group, n = 35) eye shields upon the completion of surgery. The primary outcome was the difference in EA incidence between the groups. Results: After adjusting the data for age and sex, children in the LT group were less likely to develop EA than those in the MG group (5 of 35 children [14.3%] vs 15 of 35 children [42.9%]; adjusted odds ratio [OR], 95% CI: 0.28, 0.08-0.94; P = 0.040). Compared with the MG group, a significant reduction in the median score of the peak Aono's four-point scale was observed in the LT group (P = 0.024; Benjamini-Hochberg [BH] critical value = 0.050). Additionally, the incidences of agitation (peak Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium score >= 16) and propofol administration in the LT group were significantly lower than those in the MG group (P = 0.022; BH critical value = 0.038 and P = 0.017; B-H critical value = 0.025, respectively). Conclusions: The application of light-transmitting eye shields for wound dressing could help prevent EA after pediatric bilateral strabismus surgery under sevoflurane anesthesia.
