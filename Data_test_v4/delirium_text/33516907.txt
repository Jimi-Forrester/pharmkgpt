33516907|a|OBJECTIVES: In clinical practice it is important to identify patients suffering from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) who will progress to Alzheimer's disease (AD). The purpose of this study is to investigate whether lipid metabolites and vitamin B12 and folate levels are effective biomarker for an accurate prediction of MCI-to-AD conversion. METHODS: During the standard diagnostic assessment at our memory clinic 48 cognitively healthy subjects and MCI patients were recruited. These participants were followed up after 7-9 years. Blood was collected, various biochemical markers (including vitamin B12 and folate) analysed and plasma lipids were measured using the AbsoluteIDQ p150 Kit. RESULTS: There was no significant change in lipid levels in controls converting to MCI. However, we found significant changes in five lipids in converters from controls to AD. Interestingly, also two lipids were altered when MCI re-converted to controls. Vitamin B12 levels were not affected by conversion but folate levels significantly decreased in MCI-AD conversion. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our study provides evidence that some plasma lipids are significantly altered in subjects converting to AD. Future studies will investigate whether the peripheral lipid changes correspond with changes in the brain during the course of the disease. Although this is a small study, there are indications that lipids may be suitable as prognostic markers.
