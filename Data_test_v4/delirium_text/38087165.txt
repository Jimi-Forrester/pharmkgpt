38087165|t|Pathological Deficit of Cystatin B Impairs Synaptic Plasticity in EPM1 Human Cerebral Organoids.
38087165|a|Cystatin B (CSTB) is a small protease inhibitor protein being involved in cell proliferation and neuronal differentiation. Loss-of-function mutations in CSTB gene cause progressive myoclonic epilepsy 1 (EPM1). We previously demonstrated that CSTB is locally synthesized in synaptic nerve terminals from rat brain and secreted into the media, indicating its role in synaptic plasticity. In this work, we have further investigated the involvement of CSTB in synaptic plasticity, using synaptosomes from human cerebral organoids (hCOs) as well as from rodents' brain. Our data demonstrate that CSTB is released from synaptosomes in two ways: (i) as a soluble protein and (ii) in extracellular vesicles-mediated pathway. Synaptosomes isolated from hCOs are enriched in pre-synaptic proteins and contain CSTB at all developmental stages analyzed. CSTB presence in the synaptic territories was also confirmed by immunostaining on human neurons in vitro. To investigate if the depletion of CSTB affects synaptic plasticity, we characterized the synaptosomes from EPM1 hCOs. We found that the levels of presynaptic proteins and of an initiation factor linked to local protein synthesis were both reduced in EPM1 hCOs and that the extracellular vesicles trafficking pathway was impaired. Moreover, EPM1 neurons displayed anomalous morphology with longer and more branched neurites bearing higher number of intersections and nodes, suggesting connectivity alterations. In conclusion, our data strengthen the idea that CSTB plays a critical role in the synapse physiology and reveal that pathologically low levels of CSTB may affect synaptic plasticity, leading to synaptopathy and altered neuronal morphology.
