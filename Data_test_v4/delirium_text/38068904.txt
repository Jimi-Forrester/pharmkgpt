38068904|a|Immunosenescence and chronic inflammation associated with old age accompany brain aging and the loss of complex behaviors. Neuroinflammation in the hippocampus plays a pivotal role in the development of cognitive impairment and anxiety. However, the underlying mechanisms have not been fully explained. In this study, we aimed to investigate the disruption of insulin signaling and the mechanisms underlying metabolic inflammation ("metaflammation") in the brains of wild-type (WT) and NLRP3 knockout (KO) mice of different ages. We found a significant upregulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the hippocampus during aging, leading to an increase in the expression of phosphorylated metaflammation proteinases and inflammatory markers, along with an increase in the number of senescent cells. Additionally, metaflammation causes anxiety and impairs social preference behavior in aged mice. On the other hand, deletion of NLRP3 improves some behavioral and biochemical characteristics associated with aging, such as signal memory, neuroinflammation, and metabolic inflammation, but not anxious behavior. These results are associated with reduced IL-18 signaling and the PKR/IKKbeta/IRS1 pathway as well as the SASP phenotype. In NLRP3 gene deletion conditions, PKR is down-regulated. Therefore, it is likely that slowing aging through various NLRP3 inhibition mechanisms will lessen the corresponding cognitive decline with aging. Thus, the genetic knockout of the NLRP3 inflammasome can be seen as a new therapeutic strategy for slowing down central nervous system (CNS) aging.
