8610157|t|Enhanced pathologic properties of Dutch-type mutant amyloid beta-protein.
8610157|a|Cerebrovascular amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) deposition is a pathological feature of several related disorders including Alzheimer disease and hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis Dutch-type (HCHWA-D). HCHWA-D is caused by a point mutation in the gene that encodes the Abeta precursor and results in a Glu --> Gln substitution at position 22 of Abeta. In comparison to Alzheimer disease, the cerebrovascular Abeta deposition in HCHWA-D is generally more severe, often resulting in intracerebral hemorrhage when patients reach 50 years of age. We recently reported that Abeta(1-42), but not the shorter Abeta(1-40) induces pathologic responses in cultured human leptomeningeal smooth muscle cells including cellular degeneration that is accompanied by a marked increase in the levels of cellular Abeta precursor and soluble Abeta peptide. In the present study, we show that the HCHWA-D mutation converts the normally nonpathologic Abeta(1-40) into a highly pathologic form of the peptide for cultured human leptomeningeal smooth muscle cells. These findings suggest that these altered functional properties of HCHWA-D mutated Abeta may contribute to the early and often severe cerebrovascular pathology that is the hallmark of this disorder.
