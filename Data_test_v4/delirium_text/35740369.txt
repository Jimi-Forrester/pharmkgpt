35740369|t|ROCK and PDE-5 Inhibitors for the Treatment of Dementia: Literature Review and Meta-Analysis.
35740369|a|Dementia is a disease in which memory, thought, and behavior-related disorders progress gradually due to brain damage caused by injury or disease. It is mainly caused by Alzheimer's disease or vascular dementia and several other risk factors, including genetic factors. It is difficult to treat as its incidence continues to increase worldwide. Many studies have been performed concerning the treatment of this condition. Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) and phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) are attracting attention as pharmacological treatments to improve the symptoms. This review discusses how ROCK and PDE-5 affect Alzheimer's disease, vascular restructuring, and exacerbation of neuroinflammation, and how their inhibition helps improve cognitive function. In addition, the results of the animal behavior analysis experiments utilizing the Morris water maze were compared through meta-analysis to analyze the effects of ROCK inhibitors and PDE-5 inhibitors on cognitive function. According to the selection criteria, 997 publications on ROCK and 1772 publications on PDE-5 were screened, and conclusions were drawn through meta-analysis. Both inhibitors showed good improvement in cognitive function tests, and what is expected of the synergy effect of the two drugs was confirmed in this review.
