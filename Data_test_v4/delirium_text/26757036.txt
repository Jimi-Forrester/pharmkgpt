26757036|t|Older Adults Taking AT1-Receptor Blockers Exhibit Reduced Cerebral Amyloid Retention.
26757036|a|BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests that angiotensin II AT1-receptor blockers (ARBs) may be protective against dementia, and studies in transgenic animals indicate that this may be due to improved amyloid-beta (Abeta) clearance. OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether taking ARBs was associated with an attenuation of age-related increases in cerebral Abeta retention, and reduced progression to dementia. METHODS: Eight hundred seventy-one stroke-free and dementia-free older adults from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study underwent baseline lumbar puncture, and a subgroup (n = 124) underwent 12 and 24 month follow-up lumbar puncture. Participants were followed at variable intervals for clinical progression to dementia. Linear mixed models and ANCOVA compared ARBs users with those taking other antihypertensives (O-antiHTN) or no antihypertensives (No-antiHTN) on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Abeta and phosphorylated tau (P-tau) levels. Cox regression and chi-square analyses compared groups on progression to dementia. RESULTS: ARBs users exhibited greater vascular risk and lower educational attainment than the No-antiHTN group. Longitudinal analyses indicated higher CSF Abeta and lower P-tau in ARBs users versus other groups. Cross-sectional analyses revealed age-related decreases in CSF Abeta in other groups but not ARBs users. ARBs users were less likely to progress to dementia and showed reduced rate of progression relative to the No-antiHTN group. DISCUSSION: Patients taking ARBs showed an attenuation of age-related decreases in CSF Abeta, a finding that is consistent with studies done in transgenic animals. These findings may partly explain why ARBs users show reduced progression to dementia despite their lower educational attainment and greater vascular risk burden.
