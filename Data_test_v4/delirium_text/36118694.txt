In this study, we aimed to investigate the key ferroptosis-related genes in AD and identify a novel ferroptosis-related gene diagnosis model for patients with AD. Materials and methods: We extracted the human blood and hippocampus gene expression data of five datasets (GSE63060, GSE63061, GSE97760, GSE48350, and GSE5281) in the Gene Expression Omnibus database as well as the ferroptosis-related genes from FerrDb. Differentially expressed ferroptosis-related genes were screened by random forest classifier, and were further used to construct a diagnostic model of AD using an artificial neural network. The patterns of immune infiltration in the peripheral immune system of AD were also investigated using the CIBERSORT algorithm. Results: We first screened and identified 12 ferroptosis-related genes (ATG3, BNIP3, DDIT3, FH, GABARAPL1, MAPK14, SOCS1, SP1, STAT3, TNFAIP3, UBC, and ULK) via a random forest classifier, which was differentially expressed between the AD and normal control groups. Based on the 12 hub genes, we successfully constructed a satisfactory diagnostic model for differentiating AD patients from normal controls using an artificial neural network and validated its diagnostic efficacy in several external datasets. Further, the key ferroptosis-related genes were found to be strongly correlated to immune cells infiltration in AD. Conclusion: We successfully identified 12 ferroptosis-related genes and established a novel diagnostic model of significant predictive value for AD. These results may help understand the role of ferroptosis in AD pathogenesis and provide promising therapeutic strategies for patients with AD.
