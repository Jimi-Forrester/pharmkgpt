38513842|a|An inverse association between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cancer has been proposed. Patients with a cancer history have a decreased risk of developing AD, and AD patients have a reduced cancer incidence, which is not seen in vascular dementia patients. Given this association, common molecular and biological mechanisms that could explain this inverse relationship have been proposed before, such as Peptidylprolyl Cis/Trans Isomerase, NIMA-Interacting 1 (Pin1), Wingless and Int-1 (Wnt), and transformation-related protein 53 (p53)-mediated pathways, along with inflammation and oxidative stress-related proteins. A Disintegrin And Metalloprotease 10 (ADAM10) is a protease responsible for the cleavage of key AD- and cancer-related substrates, and it has inverse roles in those diseases: neuroprotective and disease-promoting, respectively. Thus, herein, we review the relevant literature linking AD and cancer and propose how ADAM10 activity might modulate the inverse association between the diseases. Understanding how this protease mediates those two conditions might raise some considerations in the ADAM10 pharmacological modulation for treating AD and cancer.
