39031372|t|A Decade of Protecting Progress: Ethics Review.
39031372|a|Ethics Review began a decade ago with a mission to identify ethical concerns that hold back innovation and to promote solutions that would move the field forward. Over this time, blood biomarkers for brain pathology and medications that treat that pathology promise to transform research and care. A central problem is that the evidence needed to guide test interpretation and practice is accumulating and there are unanswered questions. At the same time, people living with and at risk for dementia want access to their test results and involvement in their care. We promote dialog among diverse people across many institutions through collaboration with the Advisory Group on Risk Evidence Education for Dementia (AGREEDementia.org). Over the years Ethics Review continues to publish these dialogs and solutions to overcome the paralysis of indecision and ethical concerns.
