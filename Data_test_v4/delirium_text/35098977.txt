35098977|a|BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is an established risk factor for dementia. However, it remains unclear whether the presence of comorbidities could further increase dementia risk in diabetes patients. OBJECTIVES: To examine the associations between cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular comorbidities and dementia risk in T2D patients. DESIGN: Population-based cohort study. SETTING: The UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). PARTICIPANTS: 489,205 T2D patients aged over 50 years in the UK CPRD. MEASUREMENTS: Major cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular comorbidities were extracted as time-varying exposure variables. The outcome event was dementia incidence based on dementia diagnosis or dementia-specific drug prescription. RESULTS: During a median of six years follow-up, 33,773 (6.9%) incident dementia cases were observed. Time-varying Cox regressions showed T2D patients with stroke, peripheral vascular disease, atrial fibrillation, heart failure or hypertension were at higher risk of dementia compared to those without such comorbidities (HR [95% CI] = 1.64 [1.59-1.68], 1.37 [1.34-1.41], 1.26 [1.22-1.30], 1.15 [1.11-1.20] or 1.10 [1.03-1.18], respectively). Presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or chronic kidney disease was also associated with increased dementia risk (HR [95% CI] = 1.05 [1.01-1.10] or 1.11 [1.07-1.14]). CONCLUSIONS: A range of cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular comorbidities were associated with further increases of dementia risk in T2D patients. Prevention and effective management of these comorbidities may play a significant role in maintaining cognitive health in T2D patients.
