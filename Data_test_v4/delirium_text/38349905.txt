38349905|a|OBJECTIVE: Our study aims to examine the risk factors for comorbid psychosis in pediatric patients hospitalized for anti-N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis and its impact on hospital outcomes. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study using the nationwide inpatient sample (NIS 2018-2019). We included 3,405 pediatric inpatients (age 6-17 years) with a primary discharge diagnosis of anti-NMDAR encephalitis. We used binomial logistic regression model to evaluate the odds ratio (OR) of variables (demographic and comorbidities) associated with comorbid psychosis. RESULTS: The prevalence of comorbid psychosis in anti-NMDAR encephalitis inpatients was 5.3%, and majorly constituted of adolescents (72.2%) and females (58.3%). In terms of race, Blacks (OR 2.41), and Hispanics (OR 1.80) had a higher risk of comorbid psychosis compared to Whites. Among comorbidities, encephalitis inpatients with depressive disorders (OR 4.60), sleep-wake disorders (OR 3.16), anxiety disorders (OR 2.11), neurodevelopmental disorders (OR 1.95), and disruptive behavior disorders (OR 2.15) had a higher risk of comorbid psychosis. Anti-NMDAR encephalitis inpatients with comorbid psychosis had a longer median length of stay at 24.6 days (vs. 9.8 days) and higher median charges at $262,796 (vs. $135,323) compared to those without psychotic presentation. CONCLUSION: Adolescents, females, and Blacks with encephalitis have a higher risk of psychotic presentation leading to hospitalization for anti-NMDAR encephalitis. Identification of demographic predictors and comorbidities can aid in early recognition and intervention to optimize care and potentially reduce the healthcare burden.
