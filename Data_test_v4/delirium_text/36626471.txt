36626471|t|Review of systemic and syndromic complications of cannabis use: A review.
36626471|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Prescribed and non-prescribed cannabis use is common. Providers in specialties treating chronic pain - primary care, pain management, and neurology-will be coming across medical cannabis as a treatment for chronic pain, regardless of whether they are prescribers. It is important to be aware of the systemic and syndromic complications of acute and chronic cannabis use in the differential diagnosis of cardiac, cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, gastrointestinal, and psychiatric disorders. RECENT FINDINGS: Medical cannabis is legal in 36 states. Studies have shown several potentially serious adverse effects associated with cannabis use. SUMMARY: Cannabis use has the potential to cause several complications that can be easily overlooked without a preexisting high index of suspicion.
