29334419|t|A Metallo Pro-Drug to Target CuII in the Context of Alzheimer's Disease.
29334419|a|Alzheimer's disease and oxidative stress are connected. In the present communication, we report the use of a MnII -based superoxide dismutase (SOD) mimic ([MnII (L)]+ , 1+ ) as a pro-drug candidate to target CuII -associated events, namely, CuII -induced formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and modulation of the amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide aggregation. Complex 1+ is able to remove CuII from Abeta, stop ROS and prevent alteration of Abeta aggregation as would do the corresponding free ligand LH. Using 1+ instead of LH in further biological applications would have the double advantage to avoid the cell toxicity of LH and to benefit from its proved SOD-like activity.
