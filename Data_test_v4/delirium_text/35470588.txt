35470588|t|Neurological manifestations of COVID-19: A potential gate to the determinants of a poor prognosis.
35470588|a|BACKGROUND: Several investigations were carried out during the pandemic, demonstrating a number of neurological symptoms linked to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. OBJECTIVES: The goal of this review is to discuss COVID-19 disease's neurological signs and squeals. METHODOLOGY: From December 2019 to May 2020, data were retrieved from PubMed, Scopus, and ScienceDirect, as well as a manual search using Google Scholar. COVID-19, neurological symptoms, cranial nerves, motor system were among the key phrases utilized in the search. RESULTS: The intensity of respiratory involvement increases the likelihood of neurological symptoms and consequences. According to some research, it might range from 34% to 80%. The central and peripheral neural systems are both affected, resulting in cranial nerve palsies and limb paralysis. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 neurologic complications are key drivers of patient severity and mortality. Headache, convulsions, mental and psychic disorders, delirium, and insomnia are just some of the symptoms that the virus can cause. The olfactory nerve is the most commonly damaged cranial nerve, resulting in anosmia. Stroke (mostly infarction), encephalitis, meningitis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, relapse of multiple sclerosis, and transverse myelitis are all symptoms and squeals.
