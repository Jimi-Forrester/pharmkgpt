23734285|t|The safety and efficacy of dexmedetomidine for postoperative sedation in the cardiac surgery intensive care unit.
23734285|a|INTRODUCTION: The alpha2-adrenoceptor agonist dexmedetomidine is an effective postoperative sedative without clear advantages over midazolam or propofol. We hypothesized that routine use of dexmedetomidine allows early extubation in cardiac surgery patients. Secondary outcomes included the use of narcotic and non-narcotic analgesics during the first 48 hours, early postoperative functional status, and the incidence of bradycardia or hypotension. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed patients admitted to a cardiothoracic intensive care unit after cardiac surgery. Patient charts and the Society of Thoracic Surgery National database were reviewed. Patients who received no sedation were compared to those who received dexmedetomidine. RESULTS: Ninety-nine patients (52 receiving no sedation and 47 receiving dexmedetomidine) were included in this study. The median time to extubation was 3.9 (2.8-5.4) hours in the control group versus 4.7 (3.45-6.52) hours in the dexmedetomidine (P=.16). The incidence of bradycardia, hypotension, the ability to ambulate, and Glascow Coma Scores = 15 on postoperative day 0 did not differ significantly. Acetaminophen was used more frequently in the first 48 hours postoperatively in dexmedetomidine patients (P=.02) and a trend toward higher opioid (P=.09) and ketorolac use (P=.30) over the first 48 hours was noted. CONCLUSIONS: The use of dexmedetomidine did not allow earlier extubation or less use of analgesics when compared to no sedation. Bradycardia and hypotension were not a problem with the use of dexmedetomidine.
