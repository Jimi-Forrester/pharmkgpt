34276233|a|OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this review is to highlight the multisystem effects of prone position in ARDS patients with a focus on current findings regarding its use in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Two reviewers comprehensively searched PubMed database for literature regarding pathophysiology and efficacy of prone position in ARDS patients as well as specific data regarding this approach in COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION: Prone positioning is well-documented to improve oxygenation and cardiac function in ARDS patients and might confer increased survival, with benefits that outweigh risks such as facial edema, endotracheal tube displacement, and intraabdominal organ dysfunction in obese patients. Severe COVID-19 pneumonia, while meeting ARDS criteria, differs from typical ARDS in several ways. Data would suggest that advantages of prone position would become limited after significant disease progression and fibrosis. The use of this technique in COVID-19 requires prolonged sessions that are unprecedented in the treatment of ARDS patients. New data regarding COVID-19 pathophysiology and patients continues to evolve daily. More frequently, patients are proned while maintaining spontaneous breathing-the results of this intervention are an area for future studies. There is more to learn about the appropriate use of prone position in COVID-19 patients. The multisystem risks and benefits require clinicians to adopt a patient centered decision-making algorithm when employing this technique in COVID-19 patients. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: NA.
