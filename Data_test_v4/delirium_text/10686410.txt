10686410|a|Genetic polymorphism of human bleomycin hydrolase (hBH) has been reported to be associated with the risk of sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD). The regional and cellular distribution of mRNA encoding hBH in the brain from controls and patients with AD was examined using in situ hybridization. A hybridization signal, in the form of clusters of single cells, was observed in the white matter. Our results indicate a predominantly astrocytic expression of hBH in the investigated human brain regions. Although the signal intensity was generally reduced in AD brains, the large variability among controls rendered this trend statistically insignificant.
