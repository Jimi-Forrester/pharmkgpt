38317569|a|OBJECTIVE: This series of audits aimed to determine current best practice in delirium management in a tertiary teaching hospital and to identify strategies to improve the quality of care in delirium with a focus on prevention. METHODS: We completed a series of audits following the formation of the Cognitive Impairment Reference Group, a multidisciplinary team that was created to implement delirium management guidelines and monitor compliance. Audit 1 focused on antipsychotic use in patients aged 66 years and older. Audit 2 reviewed delirium care in the Acute Medical Ward. Audit 3 included ethnographic data and investigated the use of non-pharmacological methods to prevent and manage delirium in the Geriatric Ward. Two years on, Audit 4 is a repeat of Audit 1. RESULTS: There were improved rates of cognitive screening between Audits 2 and 3 from 65% n = 40 to 86% n = 102, respectively. Most patients had one form of non-pharmacological strategy in place to prevent delirium however few had a multicomponent approach. Fewer patients were prescribed benzodiazepines alongside antipsychotics 28.57% n = 35 in Audit 1 compared to Audit 4 12.5% n = 32. CONCLUSIONS: Improved quality of care in delirium management is achievable via a co-ordinated multidisciplinary approach. These audits demonstrated improvements in both rates of cognitive screening, and use of non-pharmacological strategies prior to antipsychotic medication use and better adherence to guidelines for antipsychotic prescribing. Areas for further development in delirium prevention include the uptake of screening and individualised non-pharmacological strategies.
