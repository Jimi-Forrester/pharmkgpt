37402210|t|Role of light walking pace on cognition: Findings from the Maine-Syracuse Longitudinal Study.
37402210|a|Moderate- to vigorous intensities of physical activity are recommended for health promotion, including brain health. Regular physical activity is considered a modifiable factor to delay -perhaps prevent- onset of dementias such as Alzheimer's disease. Little is known about the benefits of light physical activity. We analyzed data from a 998 community-dwelling, cognitively unimpaired participants from the Maine-Syracuse Longitudinal Study (MSLS) and investigated the role of light physical activity, defined by walking pace, across two time points. Results revealed light levels of walking pace were associated with higher performance at the first timepoint and less decline by time 2 in the domains of verbal abstract reasoning and visual scanning and tracking, which includes both processing speed and executive function skills. When examining change over time (N = 583), increasing walking pace was associated with less decline at time two for the domains of visual scanning and tracking, working memory, visual spatial ability, and working memory, but not verbal abstract reasoning. These findings highlight the relevance of light physical activity and the need to investigate its contribution to cognitive function. From a public health perspective, this may encourage more adults to adopt a light level of exercise and still reap health benefits.
