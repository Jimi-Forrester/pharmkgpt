3139259|a|In addition to neurofibrillary tangles and senile plaques, antibodies to human tau revealed extensive tau-immunoreactive meshworks in layers III and V of the neocortex affected with Alzheimer's disease. The meshworks consisted of innumerable abnormally curly fibers, which were coming from somata and dendrites of pyramidal cells. Their morphological appearance suggests that those curly fibers represent somatodendritic sprouting.
