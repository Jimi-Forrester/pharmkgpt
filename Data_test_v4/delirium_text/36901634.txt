36901634|t|Changes in Gut Microbiota and Multiple Sclerosis: A Systematic Review.
36901634|a|INTRODUCTION: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory neurodegenerative disease mediated by autoimmune reactions against myelin proteins and gangliosides in the grey and white matter of the brain and spinal cord. It is considered one of the most common neurological diseases of non-traumatic origin in young people, especially in women. Recent studies point to a possible association between MS and gut microbiota. Intestinal dysbiosis has been observed, as well as an alteration of short-chain fatty acid-producing bacteria, although clinical data remain scarce and inconclusive. OBJECTIVE: To conduct a systematic review on the relationship between gut microbiota and multiple sclerosis. METHOD: The systematic review was conducted in the first quarter of 2022. The articles included were selected and compiled from different electronic databases: PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, Proquest, Cochrane, and CINAHL. The keywords used in the search were: "multiple sclerosis", "gut microbiota", and "microbiome". RESULTS: 12 articles were selected for the systematic review. Among the studies that analysed alpha and beta diversity, only three found significant differences with respect to the control. In terms of taxonomy, the data are contradictory, but confirm an alteration of the microbiota marked by a decrease in Firmicutes, Lachnospiraceae, Bifidobacterium, Roseburia, Coprococcus, Butyricicoccus, Lachnospira, Dorea, Faecalibacterium, and Prevotella and an increase in Bacteroidetes, Akkermansia, Blautia, and Ruminocococcus. As for short-chain fatty acids, in general, a decrease in short-chain fatty acids, in particular butyrate, was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Gut microbiota dysbiosis was found in multiple sclerosis patients compared to controls. Most of the altered bacteria are short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing, which could explain the chronic inflammation that characterises this disease. Therefore, future studies should consider the characterisation and manipulation of the multiple sclerosis-associated microbiome as a focus of both diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.
