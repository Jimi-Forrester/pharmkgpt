29955475|a|Parkinson disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder in older adults characterized by motor and nonmotor symptoms and complications. Impulse control disorders (ICDs), such as pathological gambling, compulsive shopping, compulsive sexual behavior (hypersexuality), and binge eating disorder, affect 13.6% of the PD population. Use of dopamine receptor agonists (DRAs) is considered a major risk factor for ICD development. Amantadine and a high dose of levodopa were linked to ICDs to a lesser extent than DRAs. Based on the severity of behavior(s), ICDs can negatively impact social, professional, and familial lives of patients and their families. Ideally, all PD patients taking DRAs, high doses of levodopa, and/or amantadine should be routinely asked about or monitored for ICDs during therapy initiation and continuation. Dose decrease or withdrawal of the offending agent, primarily DRAs, is usually the most effective first step in ICD management. Careful dose adjustment with close monitoring is warranted due to risk for worsening of motor symptoms or emergence of dopamine agonist withdrawal syndrome (DAWS). About 1/3 of PD patients with ICD who decrease or discontinue DRA experienced DAWS. The lowest dose of DRA will need to be continued to balance ICDs and DAWS as it is not alleviated by other dopaminergic or psychotropic medications. Other therapies with low empiric evidence, such as amantadine, naloxone, cognitive behavior therapy, deep brain stimulation, and psychopharmacotherapy showed mixed results for ICD management. It is crucial that clinicians are familiar with the psychiatric complications of PD, including ICDs, beyond mere recognition and management of motor symptoms.
