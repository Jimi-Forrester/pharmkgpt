39613781|t|MMP-2-triggered, mitochondria-targeted PROTAC-PDT therapy of breast cancer and brain metastases inhibition.
39613781|a|Proteolytic targeting chimera (PROTAC) technology is a protein-blocking technique and induces antitumor effects, with potential advantages. However, its effect is limited by insufficient distribution and accumulation in tumors. Herein, a transformable nanomedicine (dBET6@CFMPD) with mitochondrial targeting capacity is designed and constructed to combine PROTAC with photodynamic therapy (PDT). In this work, we demonstrate that dBET6@CFMPD exhibits great biodistribution and retention, and can induce potent antitumor response to suppress primary and metastatic tumors, becoming a nanomedicine with potential in cancer combination therapy.
