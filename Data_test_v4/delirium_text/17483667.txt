17483667|a|Arterial hypertension is the most important modifiable cerebrovascular risk factor; its relationship with cerebrovascular disease is continuous, consistent, and independent. Different and probably converging pathophysiologic mechanisms explain the role of arterial hypertension in causing cognitive dysfunction in pathologic aging of the brain, specifically, vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease.
