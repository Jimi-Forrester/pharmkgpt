33623723|t|Mortality Risk Assessment at the Admission in Patient With Proximal Femur Fractures: Electrolytes and Renal Function.
33623723|a|In patients over 65y.o. who were surgically treated for a hip fracture, electrolytes have not been specifically studied as predictors of mortality. The main purpose of this study was to assess whether electrolytes and chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages, evaluated at admission, could represent a pre-operative prognostic factor in this population. Moreover, the role of epidemiological and clinical parameters was analyzed with and without a surgical timing stratification. This retrospective study included 746 patients. For each patient, their age, gender, fracture classification, Hb value, comorbidities, ASA class, chronic kidney disease, creatinine levels, electrolytes and surgical timing were collected. CKD-epi, MDRD, modified MDRD and BIS1 were used to obtain eGFR and CKD stages. All parameters were analyzed individually and in relation to the different surgical timing. Descriptive statistics, Chi-square test and survivability analysis with Kaplan Meier curve were used. In patients with a hip fracture non-significant association with increased mortality was shown for the following variables: Hb value, sodium values, calcium values, CKD stages and creatinine values. Otherwise altered kalemia was associated with a statistically significant increase in mortality as well as male gender, two or more comorbid medical conditions, advanced age (>75 years), higher ASA class. Surgery performed within 72h resulted in a statistically significant reduction in mortality at 6 months and, when performed in 24h-48h, a further reduction at 4 years. Age and ASA class statistically significant increased mortality regardless the surgical timing. Male patients operated after 48h from hospitalization were associated with a statistically significant increase in mortality rate. Two or more comorbidities were related to a statistically significant increased number of deaths when patients were treated after 96h. Altered kalemia values at hospitalization are associated with a statistically significant increase in mortality in patients operated after 72h from admission.
