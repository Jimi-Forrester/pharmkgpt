23473451|a|BACKGROUND: The presentation of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) features neuropsychiatric symptoms in the context of predominantly white matter cerebral edema in the setting of a diverse variety of underlying clinical entities. OBJECTIVE: To illustrate the presentation and diagnostic strategy for this under-recognized condition. METHOD: We present two cases of PRES and review the available literature. RESULTS: PRES may be due to a number of underlying conditions, but typically presents with symptoms consistent with delirium. CONCLUSIONS: Psychiatrist practicing in the general hospital should be aware of the presentation and appropriate work-up of PRES to forestall serious potential sequelae.
