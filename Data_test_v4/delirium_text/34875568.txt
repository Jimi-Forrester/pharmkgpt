34875568|t|Delirium disorder: Unity in diversity.
34875568|a|OBJECTIVE: The first objective of this review is to explore the factors that have led to and maintain the division between delirium and acute encephalopathy. The second is to explore the value of harmonizing them through the model of delirium disorder. METHOD: This narrative review outlines major distinctions between delirium and acute encephalopathy. It also compares them with the model of delirium disorder, which seeks not only to integrate them but also to offer a broader palette of treatment targets. RESULTS: Delirium implies an underlying acute encephalopathy, whereas acute encephalopathy presents as a spectrum from subsyndromal delirium to coma. Key factors that differentiate these two models include tradition, nuances of the models themselves, linguistic connotations, evoked responses from clinicians, implications of preventability and responsibility, cultural perceptions of non-pharmacological vs pharmacological interventions and economic incentives. A validated set of pathophysiological subtypes may ultimately help link the delirium-spectrum phenotype with various acute encephalopathies. CONCLUSIONS: Developing a coherent clinical and scientific approach to this set of conditions demands that we first develop a coherent understanding of the conditions themselves and how they relate to one another. Such an approach must embrace the tension between a convergent phenotype and its diverse biological underpinnings.
