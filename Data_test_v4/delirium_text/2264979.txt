2264979|a|Twenty-eight patients with the clinical diagnosis of probable Alzheimer disease (AD) were followed longitudinally until death. The presence of myoclonus, seizures, and paratonia was monitored as part of this process. At autopsy, 22 of the patients met pathologic criteria for AD and 6 had other degenerative neurologic diseases. Myoclonus was present in 55% of the AD patients and none of the non-AD patients. Seizures were present in 64% of the AD patients, and only 17% of the non-AD patients. Paratonia was found frequently in all patient groups. In most patients, symptoms developed late in the course of their illness. The incidence of myoclonus, seizures, and paratonia in our patients was higher than in most previous studies. The reasons for this finding are discussed.
