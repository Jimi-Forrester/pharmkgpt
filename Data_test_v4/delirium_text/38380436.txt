38380436|t|Roles of Microglia in Neurodegenerative Diseases.
38380436|a|In recent years, microglia have attracted attention owing to their roles in various neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Microglia, which are brain-resident macrophages, not only act as immune cells but also perform other functions in the body. Interestingly, they exert contrasting effects on different neurodegenerative diseases. In addition to the previously reported M1 (toxic) and M2 (protective) types, microglia now also include disease-associated microglia owing to a more elaborate classification. Understanding this detailed classification is necessary to elucidate the association between microglia and neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we discuss the diverse roles of microglia in neurodegenerative diseases and highlight their potential as therapeutic targets.
