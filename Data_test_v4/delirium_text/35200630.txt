35200630|a|Fucoidan is a polysaccharide obtained from marine brown algae, with anti-inflammatory, anti-viral, and immune-enhancing properties, thus, fucoidan may be used as an alternative treatment (complementary to prescribed medical therapy) for COVID-19 recovery. This work aimed to determine the ex-vivo effects of treatment with fucoidan (20 microg/mL) on mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim, using a cationic cyanine dye, 3,3'-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide (DiOC6(3)) on human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (HPBMC) isolated from healthy control (HC) subjects, COVID-19 patients (C-19), and subjects that recently recovered from COVID-19 (R1, 40 +- 13 days after infection). In addition, ex-vivo treatment with fucoidan (20 and 50 microg/mL) was evaluated on DeltaPsim loss induced by carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP, 150 microM) in HPBMC isolated from healthy subjects (H) and recovered subjects at 11 months post-COVID-19 (R2, 335 +- 20 days after infection). Data indicate that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces HPBMC loss of DeltaPsim, even 11 months after infection, however, fucoidan promotes recovery of DeltaPsim in PBMCs from COVID-19 recovered subjects. Therefore, fucoidan may be a potential treatment to diminish long-term sequelae from COVID-19, using mitochondria as a therapeutic target for the recovery of cellular homeostasis.
