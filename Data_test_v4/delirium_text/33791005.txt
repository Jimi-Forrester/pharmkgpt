33791005|t|D-ribose: Potential clinical applications in congestive heart failure and diabetes, and its complications (Review).
33791005|a|The quality of life of patients with certain diseases may be improved through the development of technologies and advancements in pharmacology, with the aim of prolonging their life. However, congestive heart failure (CHF), as well their complications, continue to be the leading cause of disease-associated death. The mechanisms underlying the development and progression of diabetes and CHF have been uncovered in a stepwise manner and the understanding of these mechanisms has improved the management of these diseases, resulting in reduced mortality and morbidity rates; however, CHF remains the leading cause of death worldwide, particularly in developed countries. In the past decades, research has indicated that several supplements and naturally occurring compounds may be used to treat muscle weakness, for cardiac failure management, rehabilitation following myocardial ischemia-reperfusion and various complications of diabetes. D-ribose is an essential component of the respiratory, skeletal and nervous systems and is a popular compound, as its supplementation may have beneficial effects. In the present review, the physiological roles, toxic reactions and the potential use of D-ribose in the management of clinical diseases are summarized.
