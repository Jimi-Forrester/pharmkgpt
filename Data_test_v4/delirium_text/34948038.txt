34948038|t|Melatonin, Clock Genes, and Mammalian Reproduction: What Is the Link?
34948038|a|Physiological processes and behaviors in many mammals are rhythmic. Recently there has been increasing interest in the role of circadian rhythmicity in the control of reproductive function. The circadian rhythm of the pineal hormone melatonin plays a role in synchronizing the reproductive responses of animals to environmental light conditions. There is some evidence that melatonin may have a role in the biological regulation of circadian rhythms and reproduction in humans. Moreover, circadian rhythms and clock genes appear to be involved in optimal reproductive performance. These rhythms are controlled by an endogenous molecular clock within the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in the hypothalamus, which is entrained by the light/dark cycle. The SCN synchronizes multiple subsidiary oscillators (clock genes) existing in various tissues throughout the body. The basis for maintaining the circadian rhythm is a molecular clock consisting of transcriptional/translational feedback loops. Circadian rhythms and clock genes appear to be involved in optimal reproductive performance. This mini review summarizes the current knowledge regarding the interrelationships between melatonin and the endogenous molecular clocks and their involvement in reproductive physiology (e.g., ovulation) and pathophysiology (e.g., polycystic ovarian syndrome).
