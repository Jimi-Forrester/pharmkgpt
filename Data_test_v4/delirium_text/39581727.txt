39581727|a|OBJECTIVE: Mechanically ventilated patients experience significant suffering in intensive care units (ICUs). Recognising and understanding these patients' distressing experiences can greatly improve the quality of care provided. This study aims to explore the lived experiences of conscious intubated patients in ICUs in Iran. DESIGN: A qualitative study was conducted using an interpretative phenomenological approach. In-depth interviews served as the primary means of data collection. Subsequently, the collected data was analysed using the method of Diekelmann et al (1989). SETTING: The study was conducted in the ICU. PARTICIPANTS: A purposive method was employed to select 13 patients who underwent conscious intubation for over 24 hours. RESULTS: Three main themes and seven subthemes emerged from the data analysis of the lived experience: (1) interpersonal discourse complexity (semantic misalignment and others' impressionability), (2) sensory disquietude (pharyngeal discomfort, thirst beyond the quench and disgust with oral hygiene) and (3) resilient adaptation (emotional responses and coping strategies). CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the lived experiences reveal a nuanced understanding of the intricate interplay between communication barriers, sensory discomfort and the adaptive capacities of conscious intubated patients in the ICU. This comprehensive analysis contributes to a deeper appreciation of their multifaceted experiences.
