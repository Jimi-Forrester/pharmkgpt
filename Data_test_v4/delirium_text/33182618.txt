33182618|t|Updates on the Risk of Neuropsychiatric and Gastrointestinal Comorbidities in Rosacea and Its Possible Relationship with the Gut-Brain-Skin Axis.
33182618|a|Rosacea is a common chronic cutaneous inflammatory disorder. Recently, patients with rosacea were identified as having a higher risk of developing various comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease, psychiatric disorders, neurologic disorders, and gastrointestinal disorders. However, the risks of some comorbidities in patients with rosacea are somewhat contradictory, depending upon the study design. Moreover, pathomechanisms associated with the comorbidities of patients with rosacea remain poorly elucidated. The purpose of this review was to provide the most up-to-date evidence on the risks of neuropsychiatric and gastrointestinal comorbidities in patients with rosacea. Moreover, the molecular pathomechanisms associated with neuropsychiatric and gastrointestinal comorbidities in patients with rosacea were evaluated based on recent studies. This review was also intended to focus more on the role of the gut-brain-skin axis in the association of neuropsychiatric and gastrointestinal comorbidities in rosacea.
