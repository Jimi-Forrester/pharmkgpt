29399155|t|Amyloid precursor protein has clinical and prognostic significance in AML1-ETO-positive acute myeloid leukemia.
29399155|a|Amyloid precursor protein (APP) has been reported to be highly expressed in acute myeloid leukemia (AML)1-eight-twenty one (ETO)-positive AML. In the present study, the clinical and prognostic significance of APP expression was assessed in 65 patients with AML1-ETO-positive AML using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The patients were divided into an APP-high expression (APP-H) group (n=32) and an APP-low expression (APP-L) group (n=33) according to the cut-off value of APP relative expression, which was calculated by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. It was observed that C-KIT mutations (14/32 vs. 3/33, P=0.009), white blood cell count (median, 23.2x109 vs. 12.4x109 cells/l; P=0.011) and bone marrow cellularity (median, 91.0 vs. 84.0%; P=0.039) and incidence of extramedullary leukemia (11/32 vs. 3/33, P=0.013) were all significantly increased in the APP-H group compared with the APP-L group. Furthermore, significantly lower rate of cumulative two-cycle complete remission (83.9 vs. 100%, P=0.016), major molecular remission following two courses of consolidation (34.5 vs. 71.4%, P=0.005), and poorer relapse-free survival (RFS) (33.5+-5.2% vs. 76.3+-6.9%, P<0.001) and overall survival (OS) (44.5+-7.0% vs. 81.9+-5.8%, P=0.002) were associated with APP overexpression. Multivariate analysis revealed that APP overexpression was a significant adverse factor affecting both RFS and OS. Taken together, these data suggest that APP may be correlated with C-KIT mutations and involved in leukemia cell proliferation, and its overexpression has an adverse effect on the prognosis in AML1-ETO-positive AML.
