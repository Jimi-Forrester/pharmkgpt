35886870|t|Altered Balance of Reelin Proteolytic Fragments in the Cerebrospinal Fluid of Alzheimer's Disease Patients.
35886870|a|Reelin binds to the apolipoprotein E receptor apoER2 to activate an intracellular signaling cascade. The proteolytic cleavage of reelin follows receptor binding but can also occur independently of its binding to receptors. This study assesses whether reelin proteolytic fragments are differentially affected in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of Alzheimer's disease (AD) subjects. CSF reelin species were analyzed by Western blotting, employing antibodies against the N- and C-terminal domains. In AD patients, we found a decrease in the 420 kDa full-length reelin compared with controls. In these patients, we also found an increase in the N-terminal 310 kDa fragment resulting from the cleavage at the so-called C-t site, whereas the 180 kDa fragment originated from the N-t site remained unchanged. Regarding the C-terminal proteolytic fragments, the 100 kDa fragment resulting from the cleavage at the C-t site also displayed increased levels, whilst the one resulting from the N-t site, the 250 kDa fragment, decreased. We also detected the presence of an aberrant reelin species with a molecular mass of around 500 kDa present in AD samples (34 of 43 cases), while it was absent in the 14 control cases analyzed. These 500 kDa species were only immunoreactive to N-terminal antibodies. We validated the occurrence of these aberrant reelin species in an Abeta42-treated reelin-overexpressing cell model. When we compared the AD samples from APOE genotype subgroups, we only found minor differences in the levels of reelin fragments associated to the APOE genotype, but interestingly, the levels of fragments of apoER2 were lower in APOE epsilon4 carriers with regards to APOE epsilon3/epsilon3. The altered proportion of reelin/apoER2 fragments and the occurrence of reelin aberrant species suggest a complex regulation of the reelin signaling pathway, which results impaired in AD subjects.
