A missed diagnosis can lead to improper management and poor outcomes. Moreover, nonspecialists lack a simple diagnostic model with high accuracy for AD diagnosis. Methods: Randomly assigned data, including training data, of 6000 patients and test data of 1932 from 7932 patients who visited our memory clinic between 2009 and 2021 were introduced into the artificial intelligence (AI)-based AD diagnostic model, which we had developed. Results: The AI-based AD diagnostic model used age, sex, Hasegawa's Dementia Scale-Revised, the Mini-Mental State Examination, the educational level, and the voxel-based specific regional analysis system for Alzheimer's disease (VSRAD) score. It had a sensitivity, specificity, and c-static value of 0.954, 0.453, and 0.819, respectively. The other AI-based model that did not use the VSRAD had a sensitivity, specificity, and c-static value of 0.940, 0.504, and 0.817, respectively. Discussion: We created an AD diagnostic model with high sensitivity for AD diagnosis using only data acquired in daily clinical practice. By using these AI-based models, nonspecialists could reduce missed diagnoses and contribute to the appropriate use of medical resources.
