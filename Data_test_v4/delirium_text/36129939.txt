36129939|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) is a group of microvascular occlusive disorders that presents with neurological involvement in up to 87% of the cases. Although the central nervous system (CNS) is an important target organ in TMA, the role of neurological manifestations in the disease clinical course is not well established. In this study, we described the neurological manifestations and CNS radiological aspects in patients with a first, acute TMA event. We also examined the association between severe neurological involvement and adverse clinical outcomes in TMA. METHODS: A cohort of patients diagnosed with a first TMA event between 1995 and 2016 was included, their medical charts and imaging tests were retrospectively evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 49 patients were included, 85.7% were women and the mean age was 36.5 years-old (SD 13.0). Neurological manifestations were described in 85.7% of the patients, most of them (88%) were considered severe and consisted of confusion, compromised sensorimotor function, stupor, seizures, and personality change. Imaging tests were performed in 62% of the patients with neurological manifestations and detected acute CNS lesions, such as posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke were observed, in 7 (27%) of them. While the need for intensive care unit admission was greater and longer among patients with severe neurological manifestations, the number of plasma exchange sessions, the total duration of hospitalization and in-hospital death were similar between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Severe neurological manifestations are common in first TMA events and are responsible for a worse disease presentation at admission. While the effect of neurological manifestations on acute TMA clinical course seems to be modest, these manifestations may have an important impact on the development of chronic cognitive impairment, which highlights the need for proper diagnosis and treatment.
