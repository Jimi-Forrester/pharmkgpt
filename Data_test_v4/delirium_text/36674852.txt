36674852|t|Mechanistic Insights, Treatment Paradigms, and Clinical Progress in Neurological Disorders: Current and Future Prospects.
36674852|a|Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) are a major cause of disability and are related to brain development. The neurological signs of brain lesions can vary from mild clinical shortfalls to more delicate and severe neurological/behavioral symptoms and learning disabilities, which are progressive. In this paper, we have tried to summarize a collective view of various NDs and their possible therapeutic outcomes. These diseases often occur as a consequence of the misfolding of proteins post-translation, as well as the dysfunctional trafficking of proteins. In the treatment of neurological disorders, a challenging hurdle to cross regarding drug delivery is the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The BBB plays a unique role in maintaining the homeostasis of the central nervous system (CNS) by exchanging components between the circulations and shielding the brain from neurotoxic pathogens and detrimental compounds. Here, we outline the current knowledge about BBB deterioration in the evolving brain, its origin, and therapeutic interventions. Additionally, we summarize the physiological scenarios of the BBB and its role in various cerebrovascular diseases. Overall, this information provides a detailed account of BBB functioning and the development of relevant treatments for neurological disorders. This paper will definitely help readers working in the field of neurological scientific communities.
