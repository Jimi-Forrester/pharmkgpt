38594663|a|BACKGROUND: Highly resilient adolescents with type 1 diabetes have been proved to achieve within-target glycemic outcomes and experience high quality of life. The ecological resilience model for adolescents with type 1 diabetes was developed in this study. It aims to increase our understanding of how resilience is both positively and negatively affected by internal and environmental ecological factors. METHODS: This cross-sectional study surveyed 460 adolescents with type 1 diabetes from 36 cities in 11 provinces, China. Participants completed self-report questionnaires on resilience, family functioning, peer support, peer stress, coping style, and demographics. Standard glycated hemoglobin tests were performed on the adolescents. Structural equation modeling was applied to analyze the data. RESULTS: The ecological resilience model for adolescents with type 1 diabetes was a good model with a high level of variance in resilience (62%). Family functioning was the most important predictor of resilience, followed by peer support, positive coping, and peer stress. Moreover, positive coping was the mediator of the relationship between family functioning and resilience. Positive coping and peer stress co-mediated the association between peer support and resilience. CONCLUSIONS: Family functioning, peer relationships, and positive coping are interrelated, which may jointly influence resilience. The findings provide a theoretical basis for developing resilience-promotion interventions for adolescents with type 1 diabetes, which may lead to health improvements during a vulnerable developmental period.
