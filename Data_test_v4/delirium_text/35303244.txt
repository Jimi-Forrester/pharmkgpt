35303244|t|COVID-19 and its impact on the brain and Mind- A conceptual model and supporting evidence.
35303244|a|Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the novel coronavirus that is causing the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, was first reported in late 2019. Since then, an unprecedented amount of new knowledge has emerged about this virus and its treatment. Although the reported symptoms of COVID-19 are primarily respiratory with acute respiratory distress syndrome, SARS-CoV-2 has also been shown to affect other organs, including brain, and there are growing reports of neuropsychiatric symptoms due to COVID-19. There are two suggested pathways for how COVID-19 can affect the brain and mind: the direct impact on the brain and impact mediated via stress. Direct impact on the brain is manifested as encephalitis/encephalopathy with altered mental status (AMS) and delirium. In this paper, we summarize evidence from studies of previous outbreaks and current data from the COVID-19 pandemic that describe how COVID-19 is associated with an increased prevalence of anxiety, stress, poor sleep quality, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and depression among the general population during the pandemic. In addition, we summarize the current evidence that supports how COVID-19 can also impact the CNS directly and result in delirium, cerebrovascular events, encephalitis, unspecified encephalopathy, AMS, or peripheral neurologic disorders.
