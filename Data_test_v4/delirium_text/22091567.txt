22091567|a|Although a number of studies have documented the negative clinical and economic consequences of delirium, interventions to prevent and treat delirium are infrequently implemented. The importance of delirium may continue to be underestimated until its societal and economic effects are documented. The current article outlines the existing literature related to long-term sequelae and costs associated with delirium and stresses the importance of such research in prompting recognition, prevention, and treatment efforts that could reduce the effect of delirium and improve quality of life for older adults and their caregivers.
