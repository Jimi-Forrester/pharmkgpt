39551540|t|Update on Perioperative Delirium.
39551540|a|A strong association between frailty and in-hospital delirium in nonsurgical patients has been shown. Physical and cognitive frailties have been associated with decline and dysfunction in the frontal cognitive domains. Risk factors for frailty are similar to risk factors for postoperative delirium (POD). Frailty can be screened and diagnosed by various tools and instruments. Different anesthetic techniques have been studied to decrease the incidence of POD. However, no anesthetic technique has been conclusively proven to decrease the risk of POD. Patients with dementia develop delirium more often, and delirium is associated with accelerated cognitive decline.
