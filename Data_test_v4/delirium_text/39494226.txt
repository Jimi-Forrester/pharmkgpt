39494226|t|Clinical and Laboratory Characteristics, Diagnosis, and Treatment of Patients with Neurosyphilis in Emergency Department: A Retrospective Study of 12 Patients.
39494226|a|Purpose: Syphilis, caused by Treponema pallidum, presents a diagnostic challenge due to its diverse clinical manifestations. Neurosyphilis has seen a resurgence in recent years, particularly among men who have sex with men and those living with HIV. Diagnosis of neurosyphilis in emergency settings is challenging due to its varied neurological presentations. This study aims to serve as a reference for dermatologists and neurologists in diagnosing and treating neurosyphilis. Patients and Methods: This retrospective study analyzed patients who presented with neuropsychiatric symptoms and were ultimately diagnosed with neurosyphilis. These patients were collected from the emergency department in Peking Union Medical College Hospital between January 2018 and November 2023. The medical history, clinical symptoms, laboratory examinations, cranial MRI characteristics, and treatment regimens of these patients were investigated. Results: Among the included 12 neurosyphilis patients, memory deterioration was observed in 8 out of the 12 neurosyphilis patients. Diagnosis often resulted in delays, with misdiagnoses mainly including Alzheimer's disease, stroke, and epilepsy. Neuroimaging revealed various abnormalities, predominantly affecting ventricular and temporal regions. Treatment with penicillin-based regimens varied in compliance, with only a minority of patients adhering to guidelines. Treatment outcomes were inconsistent, with some patients experiencing irreversible neurological damage and fluctuating serum rapid plasma reagin (RPR) titers. Conclusion: Diagnosis of neurosyphilis in the emergency department remains challenging, necessitating awareness of its varied neurological presentations. Enhanced diagnostic strategies are imperative to accelerate treatment initiation and improve outcomes for affected individuals.
