36676783|t|A Rare Case of Primary Purulent Pericarditis Caused by Streptococcus constellatus.
36676783|a|Background: Bacteria-caused acute pericarditis is a very rare entity. It is usually associated with an underlying infection or compromised immune system. Primary purulent pericarditis in a previously healthy individual is highly unexpected; therefore, it is likely to have a delayed diagnosis and poor outcomes. Case: We report a case of an adult immunocompetent patient with primary bacterial pericarditis caused by a member of the commensal oral flora Streptococcus constellatus. The patient presented with septic shock and cardiac tamponade, and was further complicated with constrictive pericarditis, which was successfully treated with pericardiectomy. Conclusions: Bacterial pericarditis is a fulminant disease with a high mortality and complication rate. Fast recognition and prompt therapy are required to achieve a full recovery.
