37345425|t|Nitric Oxide Signal Transduction and Its Role in Skin Sensitization.
37345425|a|Nitric oxide (NO) is a signaling molecule that plays a crucial role in numerous cellular physiological processes. In the skin, NO is produced by keratinocytes, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and immune cells and is involved in skin functions such as vasodilation, pigmentation, hair growth, wound healing, and immune responses. NO modulates both innate and adaptive immune responses. As a signaling molecule and cytotoxic effector, NO influences the function of immune cells and production of cytokines. NO is a key mediator that protects against or contributes to skin inflammation. Moreover, NO has been implicated in skin sensitization, a process underlying contact dermatitis. It modulates the function of dendritic cells and T cells, thereby affecting the immune response to allergens. NO also plays a role in contact dermatitis by inducing inflammation and tissue damage. NO-related chemicals, such as nitrofatty acids and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitors, have potential therapeutic applications in skin conditions, including allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) and irritant contact dermatitis (ICD). Further research is required to fully elucidate the therapeutic potential of NO-related chemicals and develop personalized treatment strategies for skin conditions.
