34732948|t|Delirium Assessment and Management in Geriatric Psychiatry under Prevailing Indian Laws (MHCA 2017).
34732948|a|The Indian Mental Health Care Act of 2017 (the Act) focuses on the human rights of persons with mental illness. It is based on the individual's dignity, autonomy, and independence with a client-centered approach. Delirium is frequently seen in the hospitalized geriatric population, more commonly in medical and surgical wards, and much less frequently in psychiatry wards. Delirium is covered under the Act as a "substantial disturbance of thinking, mood, perception, orientation or memory that grossly impairs judgment, behavior, (and) capacity to recognize reality or ability to meet the ordinary demands of life." The Act provides provisions for capacity assessment, emergency treatment, supported admission, advance directive, and the role of nominated representative in such cases.
