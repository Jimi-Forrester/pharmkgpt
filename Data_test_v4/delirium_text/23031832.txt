23031832|a|Exposure to cigarette smoke has been associated with an increased risk of neurological diseases such as stroke, Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis. In these studies, serum and brain sections from Lewis rats or those exposed to cigarette smoke and control rats were examined for evidence of increased inflammation and oxidative stress. Immunocytochemical staining of brain sections from CS-exposed rats showed increased expression of class II MHC and, in ELISA, levels of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha were higher than for non-exposed rats. In polymerase chain reaction assays there was increased interferon-gamma, TNF-alpha, IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, IL-23, IL-6, IL-23, IL-17, IL-10, TGF-beta, T-bet and FoxP3 gene expression with CS exposure. There was also markedly elevated MIP-1alpha/CCL3, less prominent MCP-1/CCL2 and no elevation of SDF-1alpha gene expression. Analysis of samples from CS-exposed and control rats for anti-oxidant expression showed no significant difference in serum levels of glutathione and, in brain, similar levels of superoxide dismutase and decreased thioredoxin gene expression. In contrast, there was increased brain gene expression for the pro-oxidants iNOS and the NADPH components NOX4, dual oxidase 1 and p22(phox). Nrf2 expression, which is typically triggered as a secondary response to oxidative stress, was also increased in brains from CS-exposed rats with nuclear translocation of this protein from cytoplasm demonstrated in astrocytes in association with increased expression of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor gene, an Nrf2 target. These studies, therefore, demonstrate that CS exposure in these animals can trigger multiple immune and oxidative responses that may have important roles in the pathogenesis of CNS inflammatory neurological diseases.
