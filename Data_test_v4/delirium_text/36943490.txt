36943490|t|Human-Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell-Based Model of the Blood-Brain at 10 Years: A Retrospective on Past and Current Disease Models.
36943490|a|The initial discovery and derivation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) by Yamanaka and colleagues in 2006 revolutionized the field of personalized medicine, as it opened the possibility to model diseases using patient-derived stem cells. A decade of adoption of iPSCs within the community of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) significantly opened the door for modeling diseases at the BBB, a task until then considered challenging, if not impossible.In this book chapter, we provided an extensive review of the literature on the use of iPSC-based models of the human BBB to model neurological diseases including infectious diseases (COVID-19, Streptococcus, Neisseria) neurodevelopmental diseases (adrenoleukodystrophy, Allan-Herndon-Dudley Syndrome, Batten's disease, GLUT1 deficiency syndrome), and neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's disease, the current findings and observations, but also the challenges and limitations inherent to the use of iPSC-based models in reproducing the human BBB during health and diseases in a Petri dish.
