38485934|a|Late-life depression has been consistently associated with lower gray matter volume, the origin of which remains largely unexplained. Recent in-vivo PET findings in early-onset depression and Alzheimer's Disease suggest that synaptic deficits contribute to the pathophysiology of these disorders and may therefore contribute to lower gray matter volume in late-life depression. Here, we investigate synaptic density in vivo for the first time in late-life depression using the synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A receptor radioligand 11C-UCB-J. We included 24 currently depressed adults with late-life depression (73.0 +- 6.2 years, 16 female, geriatric depression scale = 19.5 +- 6.8) and 36 age- and gender-matched healthy controls (70.4 +- 6.2 years, 21 female, geriatric depression scale = 2.7 +- 2.9) that underwent simultaneous 11C-UCB-J positron emission tomography (PET) and 3D T1- and T2-FLAIR weighted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging on a 3-tesla PET-MR scanner. We used analyses of variance to test for 11C-UCB-J binding and gray matter volumes differences in regions implicated in depression. The late-life depression group showed a trend in lower gray matter volumes in the hippocampus (p = 0.04), mesial temporal (p = 0.02) and prefrontal cortex (p = 0.02) compared to healthy control group without surviving correction for multiple comparison. However, no group differences in 11C-UCB-J binding were found in these regions nor were any associations between 11C-UCB-J and depressive symptoms. Our data suggests that, in contrast to Alzheimer's Disease, lower gray matter volume in late-life depression is not associated with synaptic density changes. From a therapeutic standpoint, preserved synaptic density in late-life depression may be an encouraging finding.
