28444076|a|OBJECTIVE:: To review the literature on the use of variable mechanical ventilation and the main outcomes of this technique. METHODS:: Search, selection, and analysis of all original articles on variable ventilation, without restriction on the period of publication and language, available in the electronic databases LILACS, MEDLINE , and PubMed, by searching the terms "variable ventilation" OR "noisy ventilation" OR "biologically variable ventilation". RESULTS:: A total of 36 studies were selected. Of these, 24 were original studies, including 21 experimental studies and three clinical studies. CONCLUSION:: Several experimental studies reported the beneficial effects of distinct variable ventilation strategies on lung function using different models of lung injury and healthy lungs. Variable ventilation seems to be a viable strategy for improving gas exchange and respiratory mechanics and preventing lung injury associated with mechanical ventilation. However, further clinical studies are necessary to assess the potential of variable ventilation strategies for the clinical improvement of patients undergoing mechanical ventilation.
