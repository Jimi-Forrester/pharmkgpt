39571640|t|Development of a novel radioiodinated compound for amyloid and tau deposition imaging in Alzheimer's disease and tauopathy mouse models.
39571640|a|Non-invasive determination of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) and tau deposition are important for early diagnosis and therapeutic intervention for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and non-AD tauopathies. In the present study, we investigated the capacity of a novel radioiodinated compound AD-DRK (123/125I-AD-DRK) with 50% inhibitory concentrations of 11 nM and 2 nM for Abeta and tau aggregates, respectively, as a single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) ligand in living brains. In vitro and ex vivo autoradiography with 125I-AD-DRK was performed in postmortem human and two transgenic (Tg) mice lines with either fibrillar Abeta or tau accumulation, APP23 and rTg4510 mice. SPECT imaging of 123I-AD-DRK was performed in APP23 mice to investigate the ability of AD-DRK to visualize fibrillar protein deposition in the living brain. In-vitro autoradiogram of 125I-AD-DRK showed high specific radioactivity accumulation in the temporal cortex and hippocampus of AD patients and the motor cortex of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) patients enriched by Abeta and/or tau aggregates. Ex-vivo autoradiographic images also demonstrated a significant increase in 125I-AD-DRK binding in the forebrain of both APP23 and rTg450 mice compared to their corresponding non-Tg littermates. SPECT imaging successfully captured Abeta deposition in the living brain of aged APP23 mice. The present study developed a novel high-contrast SPECT agent for assisting the diagnosis of AD and non-AD tauopathies, likely benefiting from its affinity for both fibrillar Abeta and tau.
