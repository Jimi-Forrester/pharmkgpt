7817592|t|[Level of vitamin B12 and folic acid in blood serum of patients with senile dementia].
7817592|a|85 cases over 65 were examined to establish concentration of B12 and folate acid in the serum. 25 cases of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), 33 patients with Multi Infarct Dementia (MID) and 27 non demented persons were collected. Folstein's Mini Mental State and Hachinski scales were chosen for the purpose of the study 2 AD case (8%) patients demonstrated lower concentration of B12. No improvement after treatment was observed, although normalization of vitamin B12 level was reached. In elderly control group as well as in MID patients B12 and folic acid level in serum was in normal range. Statistically significant negative correlation between B12 serum concentration and dementia in woman population with MID was noted.
