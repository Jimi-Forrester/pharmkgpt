21823427|a|OBJECTIVE: To study the effect and mechanism of ginsenoside Rg1 on the spatial learning-memory ability in rats with Alzheimer's disease after transplanted with bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs). METHODS: Using digital randomization table method, seventy-five male SD rats were divided into the bilateral FF transection model group (as the model group: ambi-hippocampal fimbria-fomix transected), the sham-operative control group (the SOC group: receiving the same modeling process as the model group, but without ambi-hippocampal fimbria-fomix transected), the ginsenoside Rg1 treatment group (as the treatment group: Two weeks after modeling ginsenoside Rg1 was peritoneally injected at the dose of 5 mg/kg, once daily for four weeks in total), the BMSCs transplanted treatment group [as the control group: Two weeks after modeling every rat received transplantation of BMSCs (10 microL, 1 x 10(6) cells)], and the ginsenoside Rg1 + BMSCs treatment group (as the combination group: They received both transplantation of BMSCs and peritoneal injection of ginsenoside Rgl). The spatial learning-memory ability of rats was detected by Morris water maze and the escape latency (s) was recorded, mRNA expression of nerve growth factor (NGF) was detected using Real-time PCR. RESULTS: Six weeks after the hippocampal fimbria-fomix (FF) transection, the escape latency o feach medication group was obviously shorter than that of the model group, and the spatial learning-memory ability of dementia rats was somewhat improved. The spatial learning-memory ability of rats in the combination group was (29.95 +/- 2.03) and the mRNA expression level of NGF was (1.13 +/- 0.15), better than those in the BMSCs group (44.36 +/- 1.43, 0.78 +/- 0.09, P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Ginsenoside Rg1 could strengthen the spatial learning-memory ability in dementia rats after transplanted with BMSCs. Its mechanism might be possibly correlated with up-regulating mRNA expression of NGF in basal forebrain after BMSCs transplantation.
