36712359|t|Human FAM3C restores memory-based thermotaxis of Caenorhabditis elegans famp-1/m70.4 loss-of-function mutants.
36712359|a|The family with sequence similarity 3 (FAM3) superfamily represents a distinct class of signaling molecules that share a characteristic structural feature. Mammalian FAM3 member C (FAM3C) is abundantly expressed in neuronal cells and released from the synaptic vesicle to the extracellular milieu in an activity-dependent manner. However, the neural function of FAM3C has yet to be fully clarified. We found that the protein sequence of human FAM3C is similar to that of the N-terminal tandem domains of Caenorhabditis elegans FAMP-1 (formerly named M70.4), which has been recognized as a tentative ortholog of mammalian FAM3 members or protein-O-mannose beta-1,2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 1 (POMGnT1). Missense mutations in the N-terminal domain, named Fam3L2, caused defects in memory-based thermotaxis but not in chemotaxis behaviors; these defects could be restored by AFD neuron-specific exogenous expression of a polypeptide corresponding to the Fam3L2 domain but not that corresponding to the Fam3L1. Moreover, human FAM3C could also rescue defective thermotaxis behavior in famp-1 mutant worms. An in vitro assay revealed that the Fam3L2 and FAM3C can bind with carbohydrates, similar to the stem domain of POMGnT1. The athermotactic mutations in the Fam3L2 domain caused a partial loss-of-function of FAMP-1, whereas the C-terminal truncation mutations led to more severe neural dysfunction that reduced locomotor activity. Overall, we show that the Fam3L2 domain-dependent function of FAMP-1 in AFD neurons is required for the thermotaxis migration of C. elegans and that human FAM3C can act as a substitute for the Fam3L2 domain in thermotaxis behaviors.
