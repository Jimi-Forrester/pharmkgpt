31230015|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prevalence of frailty in older people in outpatient physiotherapy services in an urban region in the western part of Germany. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Outpatient physiotherapy clinics were recruited in the municipal area of the city of Bochum, Germany, and selected randomly. PARTICIPANTS: Older adults aged 65 years and older seeking outpatient physiotherapy. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence of frailty was assessed based on the frailty phenotype model of physical frailty and the accumulation of deficit model, expressed as a Frailty Index. Prevalence was calculated for the whole sample and according to age-related, sex-related and diagnosis-related subgroups. RESULTS: A total of 258 participants (74+-6 years, 62% female) from 11 out of 130 (8%) different physiotherapy clinics were included. Participants' main indication for physiotherapy was an orthopaedic or surgical condition (75%). According to the model of a physical frailty phenotype, 17.8% (95% CI 13.2 to 22.5) participants were frail and 43.4% (95% CI 37.4 to 49.5) were prefrail. The Frailty Index identified 31.0% (95% CI 25.4 to 36.7) of individuals as frail. In both models, prevalence increased with age and was higher in women than in men. Slow gait speed (34%), reduced muscle strength (34%) and exhaustion (28%) were the most prevalent indicators of physical frailty. CONCLUSIONS: Frailty is comparatively common in older patients attending physiotherapy care in Germany, with one out of three individuals being frail and every second individual being physically frail or prefrail.
