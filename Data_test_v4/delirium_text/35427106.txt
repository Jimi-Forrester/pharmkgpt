35427106|t|Alzheimer's: The ABCDE Paradigm.
35427106|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias constitute a worldwide health crisis for which the design and development of global solutions is a neuropharmacologic priority. The much-publicized failures of multiple investigational agents for AD over the past 20 years drive the need to rethink our approach to therapeutics development. Herein we present the ABCDE paradigm as a conceptual tool to facilitate the development of safe, effective therapies for AD cure: (A) accessible; (B) blood-brain barrier permeant; (C) cognitive enhancing; (D) disease-modifying; (E) environmentally nontoxic.
