38048522|t|Neuroprotective Profile of Triazole Grandisin Analogue against Amyloid-Beta Oligomer-Induced Cognitive Impairment.
38048522|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by accumulation of amyloid-beta oligomers (AbetaO) in the brain, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and cognitive decline. Grandisin, a tetrahydrofuran neolignan, exhibits relevant anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Interestingly, grandisin-based compounds were shown to prevent AbetaO-induced neuronal death in vitro. However, no study has assessed the effect of these compounds on the AD animal model. This study focuses on a triazole grandisin analogue (TGA) synthesized using simplification and bioisosteric drug design, which resulted in improved potency and solubility compared with the parent compound. This study aimed to investigate the possible in vivo effects of TGA against AbetaO-induced AD. Male C57/Bl6 mice underwent stereotaxic intracerebroventricular AbetaO (90 muM) or vehicle injections. 24 h after surgery, animals received intraperitoneal treatment with TGA (1 mg/kg) or vehicle, administered on a 14 day schedule. One day after treatment completion, a novel object recognition task (NORT) was performed. Memantine (10 mg/kg) was administered as a positive control. NORT retention sessions were performed on days 8 and 16 after AbetaO injection. Immediately after retention sessions, animals were euthanized for cortex and hippocampus collection. Specimens were subjected to oxidative stress and cytokine analyses. TGA reduced the level of cortex/hippocampus lipoperoxidation and prevented cognitive impairment in AbetaO-injected mice. Additionally, TGA reduced tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) levels in the hippocampus. By contrast, memantine failed to prevent cortex/hippocampus lipid peroxidation, recognition memory decline, and AbetaO-induced increases in TNF and IFN-gamma levels in the hippocampus. Thus, memantine was unable to avoid the AbetaO-induced persistent cognitive impairment. The results showed that TGA may prevent memory impairment by exerting antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects in AbetaO-injected mice. Moreover, TGA exhibited a persistent neuroprotective effect compared to memantine, reflecting an innovative profile of this promising agent against neurodegenerative diseases, such as AD.
