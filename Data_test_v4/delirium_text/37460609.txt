37460609|a|Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) show behavioral problems due to prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE). A previous study reports changes in gene expressions linked to fatty acid (FA) metabolism in the cerebral cortex of the PAE mouse model. We find an increase of palmitic acid and arachidonic acid in phospholipid in the cerebral cortex of PAE at postnatal day 30. The increase of palmitic acid is consistent with increase of the producing enzyme, Fasn (fatty acid synthase). Decrease of 26:6 FA is also consistent with the increase of the enzyme which uses 26:6 as a substrate for making very long chain FAs, Elovl4 (elongation of very long chain fatty acids protein 4). However, there is no increase in the elongated products. Rather, lipid droplets (LDs) accumulated in the brain. Although FA-associated metabolic measurements are not affected by PAE, the abundance of FA-related gut microbiota is altered. This suggests that the gut microbiome could serve as a tool to facilitate uncovering the brain pathophysiology of FASD and a potential target to mitigate neurobehavioral problems.
