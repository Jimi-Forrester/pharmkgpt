32916633|t|Generation and characterization of a novel human iPSC line from a resilient Alzheimer's disease patient.
32916633|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that is the major cause of dementia in older people. Here, we report the derivation of human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from an AD patient at age of 80 who has the APOE epsilon4/epsilon4 genotype and is resilient to cognitive decline for 10 years. The iPSCs reprogrammed from the blood cells of this patient by transient expression of pluripotency genes maintain the epsilon4/epsilon4 genotype, are karyotypically normal and display typical iPSC characteristics. Upon differentiation, the iPSCs are able to differentiate into cells of the three germ layers, confirming their pluripotency.
