33419067|t|A Destruction Model of the Vascular and Lymphatic Systems in the Emergence of Psychiatric Symptoms.
33419067|a|The lymphatic system is important for antigen presentation and immune surveillance. The lymphatic system in the brain was originally introduced by Giovanni Mascagni in 1787, while the rediscovery of it by Jonathan Kipnis and Kari Kustaa Alitalo now opens the door for a new interpretation of neurological diseases and therapeutic applications. The glymphatic system for the exchanges of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and interstitial fluid (ISF) is associated with the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which is involved in the maintenance of immune privilege and homeostasis in the brain. Recent notions from studies of postmortem brains and clinical studies of neurodegenerative diseases, infection, and cerebral hemorrhage, implied that the breakdown of those barrier systems and infiltration of activated immune cells disrupt the function of both neurons and glia in the parenchyma (e.g., modulation of neurophysiological properties and maturation of myelination), which causes the abnormality in the functional connectivity of the entire brain network. Due to the vulnerability, such dysfunction may occur in developing brains as well as in senile or neurodegenerative diseases and may raise the risk of emergence of psychosis symptoms. Here, we introduce this hypothesis with a series of studies and cellular mechanisms.
