8148638|t|Predicting long-term outcome in individuals at risk for Alzheimer's disease with the Dementia Rating Scale.
8148638|a|The Dementia Rating Scale, previously shown to be sensitive to dementia progression, was used to differentiate among normal control subjects, patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), and those judged to be at risk for AD on the basis of subclinical memory impairment. The memory scale of the Dementia Rating Scale predicted with 93% accuracy which at-risk individuals would develop AD at 4- to 6-year follow-up.
