37080933|a|The processes of biotransformation of pantothenic acid (Pan) in the biosynthesis and hydrolysis of CoA, key role of pantothenate kinase (PANK) and CoA synthetase (CoASY) in the formation of the priority mitochondrial pool of CoA, with a high metabolic turnover of the coenzyme and limited transport of Pan across the blood-brain barrier are considered. The system of acetyl-CoA, a secondary messenger, which is the main substrate of acetylation processes including formation of N-acetyl aspartate and acetylcholine, post-translational modification of histones, predetermines protection of the neurons against degenerative signals and cholinergic neurotransmission. Biochemical mechanisms of neurodegenerative syndromes in the cases of PANK and CoASY defects, and the possibility of correcting of CoA biosynthesis in the models with knockouts of these enzymes have been described. The data of a post-mortem study of the brains from the patients with Huntington's and Alzheimer's diseases are presented, proving Pan deficiency in the CNS, which is especially pronounced in the pathognomonic neurostructures. In the frontal cortex of the patients with Parkinson's disease, combined immunofluorescence of anti-CoA- and anti-tau protein was detected, reflecting CoAlation during dimerization of the tau protein and its redox sensitivity. Redox activity and antioxidant properties of the precursors of CoA biosynthesis were confirmed in vitro with synaptosomal membranes and mitochondria during modeling of aluminum neurotoxicity accompanied by the decrease in the level of CoA in CNS. The ability of CoA biosynthesis precursors to stabilize glutathione pool in neurostructures, in particular, in the hippocampus, is considered as a pathogenetic protection mechanism during exposure to neurotoxins, development of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, and justifies the combined use of Pan derivatives (for example, D-panthenol) and glutathione precursors (N-acetylcysteine). Taking into account the discovery of new functions of CoA (redox-dependent processes of CoAlation of proteins, possible association of oxidative stress and deficiency of Pan (CoA) in neurodegenerative pathology), it seems promising to study bioavailability and biotransformation of Pan derivatives, in particular of D-panthenol, 4'-phospho-pantetheine, its acylated derivatives, and compositions with redox pharmacological compounds, are promising for their potential use as etiopathogenetic agents.
