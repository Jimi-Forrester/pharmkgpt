36614141|t|The Role of Proteolysis in Amyloidosis.
36614141|a|Amyloidoses are a group of diseases associated with deposits of amyloid fibrils in different tissues. So far, 36 different types of amyloidosis are known, each due to the misfolding and accumulation of a specific protein. Amyloid deposits can be found in several organs, including the heart, brain, kidneys, and spleen, and can affect single or multiple organs. Generally, amyloid-forming proteins become prone to aggregate due to genetic mutations, acquired environmental factors, excessive concentration, or post-translational modifications. Interestingly, amyloid aggregates are often composed of proteolytic fragments, derived from the degradation of precursor proteins by yet unidentified proteases, which display higher amyloidogenic tendency compared to precursor proteins, thus representing an important mechanism in the onset of amyloid-based diseases. In the present review, we summarize the current knowledge on the proteolytic susceptibility of three of the main human amyloidogenic proteins, i.e., transthyretin, beta-amyloid precursor protein, and alpha-synuclein, in the onset of amyloidosis. We also highlight the role that proteolytic enzymes can play in the crosstalk between intestinal inflammation and amyloid-based diseases.
