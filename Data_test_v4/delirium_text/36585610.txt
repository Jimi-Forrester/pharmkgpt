36585610|t|Anesthesia and surgery-induced elevation of CSF sTREM2 is associated with early cognitive dysfunction after thoracoabdominal aortic dissection surgery.
36585610|a|PURPOSE: Soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (sTREM2) concentration is increased in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in early symptomatic phase of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study investigated whether CSF sTREM2 has a relationship with early cognitive dysfunction following surgery in cardiac surgery patients. METHODS: A total of 82 patients undergoing thoracoabdominal aortic replacement were recruited in this study. Neuropsychological testing battery was conducted before and after surgery. Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) was defined as a Z-score > 1.96 on at least 2 different tests or Telephone Interviews for Cognitive Status-Modified (TICS-M) score < 27. The CSF and serum sTREM2, Abeta42, T-tau and P-tau were collected and measured by ELISA on day before surgery and postoperative day 3. RESULTS: Patients were classified into POCD (n = 34) and non-POCD (n = 48) groups according to Z-score. Compared to non-POCD group, the levels of CSF sTREM2 (p < 0.001) and serum sTREM2 (p = 0.001) were significantly higher in POCD group on postoperative day 3. The levels of Abeta42 (p = 0.005) and Abeta42/T-tau ratio (p = 0.036) were significantly lower in POCD group on postoperative day 3. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that higher value of postoperative CSF sTREM2 (odds ratio: 1.06, 95% confidence interval: 1.02-1.11, p = 0.009), age (OR: 1.15, 95%CI: 1.03-1.28, p = 0.014) and POD duration (OR: 2.47, 95%CI: 1.15-5.29, p = 0.02) were the risk factors of POCD. CONCLUSION: This study indicates that anesthesia and surgery-induced elevation of CSF sTREM2 is associated with an increased risk of early cognitive dysfunction following surgery.
