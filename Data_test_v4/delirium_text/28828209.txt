28828209|t|Prevalence for delirium in stroke patients: A prospective controlled study.
28828209|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: This study investigates the prevalence of delirium in acute stroke patients on a primary stroke unit (SU) analyzing associated risk factors and clinical outcomes. METHOD: Prospective, 4-month observational study from 2015 to 2016 on patients aged >=18 years with stroke at a German university hospital's SU. The presence of delirium as first outcome was rated at three times daily using the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM). Secondary outcome measures were duration of delirium, rehabilitation in SU, length of stay in SU and hospital, complications, and mortality. Significant risk factors were used to conduct a confounder-matched case-control analysis. RESULTS: 309 patients were included. The overall prevalence of delirium was 10.7% (33 patients) mostly on the first and second hospital day. Duration of delirium on SU was in median 1.0 day (Interquartile range: 0.3-2 days). In 39.4% of patients delirium was present in a short time interval (<=8 hr) and in 24% of patients delirium was diagnosed during nightshifts exclusively. Significant risk factors for delirium were dementia, age >=72 years, severe neurological disability on admission, and increased C-reactive protein on admission. The case-control analysis showed that delirious patients had more complications and a trend toward a worse rehabilitation. CONCLUSIONS: These results underline the importance of delirium screening in stroke patients specifically during the night. Since even short delirious episodes are associated with more complications and increased disability, future studies are needed to find delirium prevention strategies.
