35821672|a|Introduction: Physical activity (PA) promotes resilience with respect to cognitive decline, although the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. We examined the associations between objectively measured PA and resting-state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fcMRI) across seven anatomically distributed neural networks. Methods: rs-fcMRI, amyloid beta (Abeta) positron emission tomography (PET), PA (steps/day x 1 week), and longitudinal cognitive (Preclinical Alzheimer's Cognitive Composite) data from 167 cognitively unimpaired adults (ages 63 to 90) were used. We used linear and linear mixed-effects regression models to examine the associations between baseline PA and baseline network connectivity and between PA, network connectivity, and longitudinal cognitive performance. Results: Higher PA was associated selectively with greater connectivity in three networks previously associated with cognitive decline (default, salience, left control). This association with network connectivity accounted for a modest portion of PA's effects on Abeta-related cognitive decline. Discussion: Although other mechanisms are likely present, PA may promote resilience with respect to Ass-related cognitive decline, partly by increasing connectivity in a subset of cognitive networks.
