37819792|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease and the common cause of dementia. The aggregation of beta-amyloid (Abeta peptide) leading to excessive neuroinflammation is considered to be the neuropathological hallmark of AD, although the precise mechanisms remain unclear. Oligomerization of these peptides may be associated with their 42 amino acid residue arrangement. However, the process of amyloid plaque formation is still not well known. The protein folding-shape code (PFSC) method is a powerful tool to analyze protein confirmation which could exhibit the local structural folding features in detail. In our study, we utilized the PFSC to analyze Abeta peptide in humans and mice and found that mouse Abeta42 is less likely to polymerize than human's. Subsequently, we used the PFSC method to analyze the 42 amino acids of Abeta, transformed some species in human Abeta42 and obtained 7 mutants. We showed that it was not easy to aggregate Abeta in mutants. Herein, inflammatory responses were decreased, as indicated by the expression of cytokines. We confirmed that the neurotoxicity of mutant human Abeta was decreased by preventing peptide aggregation. This may represent a new therapeutic approach for treating AD.
