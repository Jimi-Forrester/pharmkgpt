12238628|a|Little is known about 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid (5-HIAA) and homovanillic acid (HVA) levels in cerebrospinal fluid of patients with Delirium Tremens revealed at onset by seizures. The aim of the study is to understand the biochemical abnormalities induced by seizures in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients involved by Delirium Tremens. Nine patients 42-62 years of age, who had experienced a Delirium Tremens after alcohol withdrawal, with one or two seizures at onset, were included in this study. The lumbar puncture (and a CT scan) were performed after the last seizure. Nine patients with neither Delirium Tremens nor seizure, needing a lumbar puncture for their medical problem, were matched by sex and by age. For the measures of 5-HIAA and HVA, we systematically took the first cm3. The mean value of 5-HIAA levels were 12.70 ng ml(-1) in the group of nine patients with Delirium Tremens versus 13.45 ng ml(-1) in the control group. The mean value of HVA levels were 19.81 ng ml(-1) in the group of nine patients with Delirium Tremens versus 25.25 ng ml(-1) in the control group. The differences were not statistically significant. During a Delirium Tremens with seizure at onset, there are no statistically significant changes in 5-HIAA and HVA levels in the cerebrospinal fluid. Our work raises the question of the role of Delirium Tremens in the normalization of the levels of neuro-mediators that usually decrease soon after seizures.
