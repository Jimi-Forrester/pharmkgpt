34116558|t|Prevalence and Factors Affecting Postoperative Delirium in a Neurosurgical Intensive Care Unit.
34116558|a|ABSTRACT: PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to identify the prevalence of, and factors affecting, postoperative delirium (POD) in patients in the neurosurgical intensive care unit. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of 127 Turkish neurosurgical intensive care unit patients admitted between May 2018 and May 2019 was conducted. Patients were assessed for the development of POD using the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist. We collected other independent data variables daily. Data were analyzed using independent sample t test, chi2 test, and logistic regression. RESULTS: The prevalence rates of POD on the first and second postoperative days were 18.9% and 8.7%, respectively. Logistic regression analysis showed that the Glasgow Coma Scale score, albumin level, Spo2 level, hemoglobin values, undergoing cranial surgery, and having intra-arterial catheter were the independent risk factors for POD. CONCLUSION: These findings may contribute to identifying patients at risk for developing POD and developing strategies to improve patient outcomes.
