26330335|t|Association of Selected Antipsychotic Agents With Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events and Noncardiovascular Mortality in Elderly Persons.
26330335|a|BACKGROUND: Data from observational studies have raised concerns about the safety of treatment with antipsychotic agents (APs) in elderly patients with dementia, but this area has been insufficiently investigated. We performed a head-to-head comparison of the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events and noncardiovascular mortality associated with individual APs (ziprasidone, olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine, levomepromazine, chlorprothixen, flupentixol, and haloperidol) in Danish treatment-naive patients aged >=70 years. METHODS AND RESULTS: We followed all treatment-naive Danish citizens aged >=70 years that initiated treatment with APs for the first time between 1997 and 2011 (n=91 774, mean age 82+-7 years, 35 474 [39%] were men). Incidence rate ratios associated with use of different APs were assessed by multivariable time-dependent Poisson regression models. For the first 30 days of treatment, compared with risperidone, incidence rate ratios of major adverse cardiovascular events were higher with use of levomepromazine (3.80, 95% CI 3.43 to 4.21) and haloperidol (1.85, 95% CI 1.67 to 2.05) and lower for treatment with flupentixol (0.54, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.66), ziprasidone (0.31, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.97), chlorprothixen (0.76, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.95), and quetiapine (0.68, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.80). Relationships were generally similar for long-term treatment. The majority of agents were associated with higher risks among patients with cardiovascular disease compared with patients without cardiovascular disease (P for interaction <0.0001). Similar results were observed for noncardiovascular mortality, although differences in associations between patients with and without cardiovascular disease were small. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggested some diversity in risks associated with individual APs but no systematic difference between first- and second-generation APs. Randomized placebo-controlled studies are warranted to confirm our findings and to identify the safest agents.
