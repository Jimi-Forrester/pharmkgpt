34541421|t|Postacute Sequelae of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Infection: A State-of-the-Art Review.
34541421|a|The vast majority of patients (>99%) with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 survive immediate infection but remain at risk for persistent and/or delayed multisystem. This review of published reports through May 31, 2021, found that manifestations of postacute sequelae of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection (PASC) affect between 33% and 98% of coronavirus disease 2019 survivors and comprise a wide range of symptoms and complications in the pulmonary, cardiovascular, neurologic, psychiatric, gastrointestinal, renal, endocrine, and musculoskeletal systems in both adult and pediatric populations. Additional complications are likely to emerge and be identified over time. Although data on PASC risk factors and vulnerable populations are scarce, evidence points to a disproportionate impact on racial/ethnic minorities, older patients, patients with preexisting conditions, and rural residents. Concerted efforts by researchers, health systems, public health agencies, payers, and governments are urgently needed to better understand and mitigate the long-term effects of PASC on individual and population health.
