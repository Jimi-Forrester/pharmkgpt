23602305|t|Delirium and cerebrospinal fluid S100B in hip fracture patients: a preliminary study.
23602305|a|OBJECTIVES: Delirium is associated with an increased risk of long-term cognitive decline, suggesting the possibility of concurrent central nervous system (CNS) injury. S100B is a putative biomarker of CNS injury and elevated serum levels in delirium have been reported. Here we hypothesize that delirium is associated with raised concentrations of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) S100B. METHODS: Forty-five patients with hip fracture aged over 60 and awaiting surgery under spinal anesthesia were assessed for delirium pre- and post-operatively. CSF S100B levels were measured in samples collected at the onset of surgery. RESULTS: Participants with pre-operative delirium (N = 8) had elevated Log10 CSF S100B (mean: -0.156; SD: 0.238) compared with those without delirium (mean: -0.306; SD: 0.162), Student's t-test t = 2.18, df = 43, p = 0.035. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides preliminary evidence of elevated CSF S100B in current delirium, consistent with findings in serum and with other studies showing elevated S100B in the presence of diverse forms of CNS injury.
