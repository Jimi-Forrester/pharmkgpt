39080077|a|BACKGROUND: Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) are sophisticated and dynamic protein structures that straddle the nuclear envelope and act as gatekeepers for transporting molecules between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. NPCs comprise up to 30 different proteins known as nucleoporins (NUPs). However, a growing body of research has suggested that NPCs play important roles in gene regulation, viral infections, cancer, mitosis, genetic diseases, kidney diseases, immune system diseases, and degenerative neurological and muscular pathologies. PURPOSE: In this review, we introduce the structure and function of NPCs. Then We described the physiological and pathological effects of each component of NPCs which provide a direction for future clinical applications. METHODS: The literatures from PubMed have been reviewed for this article. CONCLUSION: This review summarizes current studies on the implications of NPCs in human physiology and pathology, highlighting the mechanistic underpinnings of NPC-associated diseases.
