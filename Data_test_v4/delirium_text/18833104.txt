18833104|t|[The therapeutic potential of cerebrolysin in the preventive therapy of Alzheimer's disease].
18833104|a|A potential of prolonged 2-years course of cerebrolysin therapy with courses repeated every 6 months to slow down or prevent the transition of the syndrome of mild cognitive impairment, amnestic type, to clinically relevant dementia has been studied in the open comparative study of 73 patients divided into 2 groups, one of which included patients treated with cerebrolysin and another one those who did not receive this drug. The effect of the 2-years course therapy with cerebrolysin suggested by the authors has been proven. Such therapy allows to prevent the progression of cognitive deficit and development of dementia of Alzheimer's type. The results obtained give grounds to recommend this course therapy for prevention of dementia in elderly patients with mild cognitive impairment.
