17321660|t|Genotoxic effects of aluminum chloride in cultured human lymphocytes treated in different phases of cell cycle.
17321660|a|Aluminum (Al) is the most abundant metal and the third common chemical element on earth. It is known that Al is toxic, especially its trivalent form (Al(3+)), that represents the its most soluble form. Al intoxication is related to some pathogenic disorders, principally neurodegeneratives ones as Parkinson and Alzheimer diseases. The present study aimed to evaluate the mutagenic potential of aluminum chloride (AlCl(3)). Comet assay and chromosome aberrations analysis were applied to evaluate the DNA-damaging and clastogenic effects of AlCl(3), respectively, in different phases of the cell cycle. Cultured human lymphocytes were treated with 5, 10, 15 and 25 microM aluminum chloride during the G1, G1/S, S (pulses of 1 and 6h), and G2 phases of the cell cycle. All tested concentrations were cytotoxic and reduced significantly the mitotic index in all phases of cell cycle. They also induced DNA damage and were clastogenic in all phases of cell cycle, specially in S phase. AlCl(3) also induced endoreduplication and polyploidy in treatments performed during G1 phase. The presence of genotoxicity and polyploidy on interphase and mitosis, respectively, suggests that aluminum chloride is clastogenic and indirectly affects the construction of mitotic fuse in all tested concentrations.
