31435103|t|The Relationship between the Lee Score and Postoperative Mortality in Patients with Proximal Femur Fractures.
31435103|a|Objective  To verify the predictive value of the Lee score for mortality in a one-year period after proximal femur fracture surgery. The present study also evaluated the isolated predictive capacity of other variables. Methods  A sample of 422 patients with surgically-treated proximal femur fractures was evaluated. Data was collected through a review of medical records, appointments, and contact by telephone. Results  The Lee score was applied to 99.3% of the patients with proximal femur fractures submitted to surgical treatment. The mortality rate was of 22% of the sample, and the majority were classified as class I risk. The Lee score had no significant association with mortality ( p  = 0.515). High levels of serum creatinine ( p  = 0.001) and age ( p  = 0.000) were directly associated with death. Conclusion  The Lee score was not predictive of mortality in a one-year period after proximal femur fracture surgery; however, a statistical significance was observed between age and serum creatinine levels, considered separately, and death.
