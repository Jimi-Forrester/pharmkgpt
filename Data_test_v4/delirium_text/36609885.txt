36609885|t|Locus-Specific Detection of DNA Methylation: The Advance, Challenge, and Perspective of CRISPR-Cas Assisted Biosensors.
36609885|a|Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation is one of the epigenetic characteristics that result in heritable and revisable phenotype changes but without sequence changes in DNA. Aberrant methylation occurring at a specific locus was reported to be associated with cancers, insulin resistance, obesity, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, etc. Therefore, locus-specific DNA methylation can serve as a valuable biomarker for disease diagnosis and therapy. Recently, Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas systems are applied to develop biosensors for DNA, ribonucleic acid, proteins, and small molecules detection. Because of their highly specific binding ability and signal amplification capacity, CRISPR-Cas assisted biosensor also serve as a potential tool for locus-specific detection of DNA methylation. In this perspective, based on the detection principle, a detailed classification and comprehensive discussion of recent works about the latest advances in locus-specific detection of DNA methylation using CRISPR-Cas systems are provided. Furthermore, current challenges and future perspectives of CRISPR-based locus-specific detection of DNA methylation are outlined.
