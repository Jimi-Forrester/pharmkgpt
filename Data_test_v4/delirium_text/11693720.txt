11693720|t|Ultrastructural analysis of the florid plaque in variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
11693720|a|We report here the first description of florid plaques--the hallmark of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD). These plaques are composed of broad bundles of amyloid, are highly neuritic and exhibited astrocytes and microglial cells. Collectively, they are more similar to neuritic plaques of Alzheimer's disease than to kuru plaques of kuru--Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease--Gerstmann-Straussler-Sheinker disease.
