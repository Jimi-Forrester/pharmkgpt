37385071|a|BACKGROUND: Neuroinflammation is a pivotal process in the brain that contributes to the development of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). During neuroinflammation, the over-activation of microglial cells can drive the pathological processes underlying AD, including an increase in amyloid beta (Abeta) production and accumulation, ultimately leading to neuronal and synaptic loss. Dracaena cochinchinensis (Lour.) S.C. Chen, also known as "Chan-daeng" in Thai, belongs to the Asparagaceae family. In Thai traditional medicine, it has been used as an antipyretic, pain reliever, and anti-inflammatory agent. However, the effects of D. cochinchinensis on neuroinflammation are yet to be determined. PURPOSE: We aimed to evaluate the anti-neuroinflammatory activities of D. cochinchinensis stemwood extract in activated microglia. METHODS: In this study, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a potent pro-inflammatory stimulus, was used to activate microglial BV2 cells, as a cell model of neuroinflammation. Our investigation included several techniques, including qRT-PCR, ELISA, Western blotting, phagocytosis, and immunofluorescence staining, to examine the potential anti-inflammatory effects of D. cochinchinensis stemwood. RESULTS: D. cochinchinensis stemwood, named DCS, was extracted with ethanol and water. The extracts of DCS showed dose-dependent anti-inflammatory effects, markedly suppressing the LPS-mediated mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory factors, including IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, and iNOS, while increasing expression of the anti-inflammatory biomarker Arg1 in both BV2 microglia and RAW264.7 macrophages. DCS extracts also decreased the protein levels of IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, and iNOS. These findings were correlated with the suppression of phosphorylated proteins of p38, JNK, and Akt in the LPS-activated microglia. Moreover, DCS extracts significantly attenuated excessive phagocytosis of beads and Abeta fibrils during the LPS-mediated microglial activation. CONCLUSION: Taken together, our results indicated that DCS extracts had anti-neuroinflammatory properties by suppressing the expression of pro-inflammatory factors, increasing the expression of the anti-inflammatory biomarker Arg1, and modulating excessive phagocytosis in activated microglia. These findings suggested that DCS extract could be a promising natural product for the treatment of neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases, like AD.
