29732738|a|The high mortality associated with oncological diseases is mostly due to tumors in advanced stages, and their management is a major challenge in modern oncology. Angiogenesis is a defined hallmark of cancer and predisposes to metastatic invasion and dissemination and is therefore an important druggable target for cancer drug discovery. Recently, because of drug resistance and poor prognosis, new anticancer drugs from natural sources targeting tumor vessels have attracted more attention and have been used in several randomized and controlled clinical trials as therapeutic options. Here, we outline and discuss potential natural compounds as salvage treatment for advanced cancers from recent and ongoing clinical trials and real-world studies. We also discuss predictive biomarkers for patients' selection to optimize the use of these potential anticancer drugs.
