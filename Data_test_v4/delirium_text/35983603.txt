35983603|a|The discovery of a safe and efficacious drug is a complex, time-consuming, and expensive process. Computational methodologies driven by cheminformatics tools play a central role in the high-throughput lead discovery and optimization process especially when the structure of the biological target is known. Monoamine oxidases are the membrane-bound FAD-containing enzymes and the isoform monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) is an attractive target for treating diseases like Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, glioma, etc. In the current study, we have used a pharmacophore-based virtual screening technique for the identification of new small molecule MAO-B inhibitors. Safinamide was used for building a pharmacophore model and the developed model was used to probe the ZINC database for potential hits. The obtained hits were filtered against drug-likeness and PAINS. Out of the hit's library, two compounds ZINC02181408, ZINC08853942 (most active), and ZINC53327382 (least active) were further subjected to molecular docking and dynamics simulation studies to assess their virtual binding affinities and stability of the resultant protein-ligand complex. The docking studies revealed that active ligands were well accommodated within the active site of MAO-B and interacted with both substrate and entrance cavity residues. MD simulation studies unveiled additional hydrogen bond interactions with the substrate cavity residues, Tyr398 and Tyr435 that are crucial for the catalytic role of MAO-B. Moreover, the predicted ADMET parameters suggest that the compounds ZINC08853942 and ZINC02181408 are suitable for CNS penetration. Thus, the attempted computational campaign yielded two potential MAO-B inhibitors that merit further experimental investigation.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.
