32580984|a|INTRODUCTION: Community-dwelling older adults living with subjective cognitive decline or mild cognitive impairment may experience decreased efficiency in their overall functional performance. This decreased cognitive efficiency may result in anxiety, low mood, perceived stress and decreased emotional well-being and quality-of-life. These psychological symptoms may further exacerbate cognitive decline.Exploring non-pharmacological interventions such as mindfulness within primary care is vital in enabling individuals to develop strategies to manage cognitive impairment or psychological symptoms. Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) is an 8-week programme that is beneficial in alleviating psychological symptoms; however, its impact on perceived satisfaction on overall functional performance with this population has not been evaluated. The primary objective of this study is to explore the feasibility of conducting a randomised controlled trial of an occupational therapist-led MBSR programme within primary care. METHODS: Convergent mixed-methods, randomised control feasibility trial with 40 participants from an interprofessional primary care team in Toronto, Ontario. Participants are randomised into the 8-week MBSR group or wait-list control will be compared at baseline, postintervention and 4weeks follow-up. The primary aim is to determine the feasibility of the intervention with this population and setting. The secondary aim is to examine perceived satisfaction with functional performance as measured by the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure. Secondary clinical outcomes include psychological symptoms. ANALYSIS: Investigators will analyse the quantitative and qualitative data strands separately. Descriptive statistics, focus group and interviews will then be merged and further analysed to best understand the feasibility and preliminary clinical outcomes from the study. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study is approved by Women's College Hospital (2017-0056-E), and Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario (6026418). The study will follow Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials. The results will be published in peer-reviewed academic journals and disseminated to patient organisations and media.Trial registration numberNCT03867474; Pre-results.
