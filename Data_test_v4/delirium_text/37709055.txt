37709055|t|Advancements in Computer-Assisted Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease: A Comprehensive Survey of Neuroimaging Methods and AI Techniques for Early Detection.
37709055|a|Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a brain disorder that causes the brain to shrink and eventually causes brain cells to die. This neurological condition progressively hampers cognitive and memory functions, along with the ability to carry out fundamental tasks over time. From the symptoms it is very difficult to detect during its early stage. It has become necessary to develop a computer assisted diagnostic models for the early AD detection. This survey work, discussed about a review of 110 published AD detection methods and techniques from the year 2011 to till-date. This study lies in its comprehensive exploration of AD detection methods using a range of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques and neuroimaging modalities. By collecting and analysing 50 papers related to AD diagnosis datasets, the study provides a comprehensive understanding of the diversity of input types, subjects, and classes used in AD research. Summarizing 60 papers on methodologies gives researchers a succinct overview of various approaches that contribute to enhancing detection accuracy. From the review, data are acquired and pre-processed form multiple modalities of neuroimaging. This paper mainly focused on review of different datasets used, various feature extraction methods, parameters used in neuro images. To diagnosis the Alzheimer's disease, the existing methods utilized three most common artificial intelligence techniques such as machine learning, deep learning, and transfer learning. We conclude this survey work by providing future perspectives for AD diagnosis at early stage.
