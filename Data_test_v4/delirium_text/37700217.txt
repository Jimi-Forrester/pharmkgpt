37700217|t|Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Transcriptomics Revealed HCMV IE2-Related Microglia Responses in Alzheimer's-Like Disease in Transgenic Mice.
37700217|a|    Although multiple factors are known to concur with Alzheimer's disease (AD), the relationship between human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and AD-like disease is unclear. Here, we propose a hypothesis that HCMV immediate-early 2 (IE2) protein promotes microglia activation and thus leads to AD-like disease. We successfully constructed IE2 transgenic mice expressing IE2 in the hippocampus. Single-cell sequencing analysis revealed that IE2 promoted the activation of microglia and upregulated the expression of disease-associated microglia genes. Differentially expressed gene analysis and pathway enrichment revealed that IE2 upregulated immune and nervous system disease-related genes. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that the expressions of both amyloid precursor protein (APP) and p-Tau were significantly upregulated in the brains of IE2 mice and were markers of AD. Taken together, these findings provide useful insights into AD-like disease activated by HCMV IE2.
