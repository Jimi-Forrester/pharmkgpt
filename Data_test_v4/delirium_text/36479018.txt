Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) models, including diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI), and mean apparent propagator MRI (MAP-MRI), have the potential to identify early neurodegenerative WM changes associated with AD. Methods: We imaged 213 (198 cognitively unimpaired) aging adults with DWI and used tract-based spatial statistics to compare 15 DWI metrics of WM microstructure to 9 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers of AD pathology and neurodegeneration treated as continuous variables. Results: We found widespread WM injury in AD, as indexed by robust associations between DWI metrics and CSF biomarkers. MAP-MRI had more spatially diffuse relationships with Abeta42/40 and pTau, compared with NODDI and DTI. Discussion: Our results suggest that WM degeneration may be more pervasive in AD than is commonly appreciated and that innovative DWI models such as MAP-MRI may provide clinically viable biomarkers of AD-related neurodegeneration in the earliest stages of AD progression.
