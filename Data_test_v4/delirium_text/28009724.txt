28009724|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Nanotechnology typically deals with the measuring and modeling of matter at nanometer scale by incorporating the fields of engineering and technology. The most prominent feature of these engineered materials involves their manipulation/modification for imparting new functional properties. The current review covers the most recent findings of Alzheimer's disease (AD) therapeutics based on nanoscience and technology. RECENT FINDINGS: Current studies involve the application of nanotechnology in developing novel diagnostic and therapeutic tools for neurological disorders. Nanotechnology-based approaches can be exploited for limiting/reversing these diseases for promoting functional regeneration of damaged neurons. These strategies offer neuroprotection by facilitating the delivery of drugs and small molecules more effectively across the blood-brain barrier. SUMMARY: Nanotechnology based approaches show promise in improving AD therapeutics. Further replication work on synthesis and surface modification of nanoparticles, longer-term clinical trials, and attempts to increase their impact in treating AD are required.
