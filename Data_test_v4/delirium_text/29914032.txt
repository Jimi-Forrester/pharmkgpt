29914032|t|Testing Hippocampal Memory in Prodromal Dementia with Lewy Bodies.
29914032|a|The Free and Cued Selective Reminding test (FCSRT) was used to assess memory in 19 patients with prodromal dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and 25 Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. DLB scored better than AD in selective measures of the FCSRT: immediate total recall (p = 0.01) and index of sensitivity of cueing (p = 0.001), while free delayed and total memory scores were similarly impaired. The index of sensitivity of cueing held a sensitivity of 76% and specificity of 79% in distinguishing DLB. FCSRT could help in disentangling hippocampal memory deficits from memory impairment due to ineffective recall strategies.
