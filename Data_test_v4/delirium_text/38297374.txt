38297374|a|Endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) is the most effective treatment for acute ischemic stroke caused by large vessel occlusion (LVO). Yet, long-term outcome (LTO) and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in these patients have rarely been addressed, as opposed to modified Rankin scale (mRS) recordings. We analysed demographic data, treatment and neuroimaging parameters in 694 consecutive stroke patients in a maximum care hospital. In 138 of these patients with respect on receipt of written informed consent, LTO and HRQoL were collected over a period of 48 months after EVT using a standardised telephone survey (median 2.1 years after EVT). Age < 70 years (OR 4.82), lower NIHSS on admission (OR 1.11), NIHSS <= 10 after 24 h (OR 11.23) and complete recanalisation (mTICI3) (OR 7.79) were identified as independent predictors of favourable LTO. Occurrence of an infection requiring treatment within the first 72 h was recognised as a negative predictor for good long-term outcome (OR 0.22). Patients with mRS > 2 according to the telephone survey more often had complaints regarding mobility, self-care, and usual activity domains of the HRQoL. Our results underline a sustainable positive effect of effective EVT on the quality of life in LVO stroke. Additionally, predictive parameters of outcome were identified, that may support clinical decision making in LVO stroke.
