38341588|t|A cuproptosis score model and prognostic score model can evaluate clinical characteristics and immune microenvironment in NSCLC.
38341588|a|BACKGROUND: Cuproptosis-related genes (CRGs) are associated with lung adenocarcinoma. However, the links between CRGs and non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are not clear. In this study, we aimed to develop two cuproptosis models and investigate their correlation with NSCLC in terms of clinical features and tumor microenvironment. METHODS: CRG expression profiles and clinical data from NSCLC and normal tissues was obtained from GEO (GSE42127) and TCGA datasets. Molecular clusters were classified into three patterns based on CRGs and cuproptosis cluster-related specific differentially expressed genes (CRDEGs). Then, two clinical models were established. First, a prognostic score model based on CRDEGs was established using univariate/multivariate Cox analysis. Then, through principal component analysis, a cuproptosis score model was established based on prognosis-related genes acquired via univariate analysis of CRDEGs. NSCLC patients were divided into high/low risk groups. RESULTS: Eighteen CRGs were acquired, all upregulated in tumor tissues, 15 of which significantly (P < 0.05). Among the three CRG clusters, cluster B had the best prognosis. In the CRDEG clusters, cluster C had the best survival. In the prognostic score model, the high-risk group had worse prognosis, higher tumor mutation load, and lower immune infiltration while in the cuproptosis score model, a high score represented better survival, lower tumor mutation load, and high-level immune infiltration. CONCLUSIONS: The cuproptosis score model and prognostic score model may be associated with NSCLC prognosis and immune microenvironment. These novel findings on the progression and immune landscape of NSCLC may facilitate the provision of more personalized immunotherapy interventions for NSCLC patients.
