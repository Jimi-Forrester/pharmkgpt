31926624|t|On the epigenetic role of guanosine oxidation.
31926624|a|Chemical modifications of DNA and RNA regulate genome functions or trigger mutagenesis resulting in aging or cancer. Oxidations of macromolecules, including DNA, are common reactions in biological systems and often part of regulatory circuits rather than accidental events. DNA alterations are particularly relevant since the unique role of nuclear and mitochondrial genome is coding enduring and inheritable information. Therefore, an alteration in DNA may represent a relevant problem given its transmission to daughter cells. At the same time, the regulation of gene expression allows cells to continuously adapt to the environmental changes that occur throughout the life of the organism to ultimately maintain cellular homeostasis. Here we review the multiple ways that lead to DNA oxidation and the regulation of mechanisms activated by cells to repair this damage. Moreover, we present the recent evidence suggesting that DNA damage caused by physiological metabolism acts as epigenetic signal for regulation of gene expression. In particular, the predisposition of guanine to oxidation might reflect an adaptation to improve the genome plasticity to redox changes.
