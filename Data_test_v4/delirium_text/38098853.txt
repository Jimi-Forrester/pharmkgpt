38098853|t|The bidirectional association between diabetes and periodontitis, from basic to clinical.
38098853|a|The prevalence and severity of periodontitis are increased and advanced in diabetes. Severe periodontitis elicits adverse effects on diabetes by impairing insulin actions due to systemic microinflammation. Recent studies unveil the emerging findings and molecular basis of the bidirectional relationship between periodontitis and diabetes. In addition to conventional mechanisms such as hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and chronic inflammation, deficient insulin action may play a pathogenic role in the progression of periodontitis under diabetes. Epidemiologically, from the viewpoint of the adverse effect of periodontitis on diabetes, recent studies have suggested that Asians including Japanese and Asian Americans with diabetes and mild obesity (BMI <25 kg/m2) should pay more attention to their increased risk for cardiovascular diseases. In this review, we summarize recent findings on the effect of diabetes on periodontitis from the viewpoint of abnormalities in metabolism and insulin resistance with novel mechanisms, and the influence of periodontitis on diabetes mainly focused on micro-inflammation related to mature adipose tissue and discuss future perspectives about novel approaches to interrupt the adverse interrelationship.
