35335376|a|As an important source of cholinesterase inhibitors, alkaloids in natural products have high potential value in terms of exerting pharmacological activities. In this study, a strategy for targeted preparation of cholinesterase inhibitors in Uncaria rhynchophlly (Miq.) Miq. ex Havil (UR) by high-speed counter-current chromatography was provided. In the method, a two-phase polar solvent system composed of ethyl acetate/n-butanol/water (1:4:5, v/v/v) was used, which isolated five alkaloids from the UR extract for the first time. All alkaloids were identified by HR-ESI-MS and NMR as 7-epi-javaniside (1), vincosamide (2), strictosamide (3), cadambine (4), and 3alpha-dihydrocadambine (5). The poorly resolved compounds 2 and 3 were separated by preparative HPLC (prep-HPLC). Among them, compounds 1, 4, and 5 were firstly obtained from UR. The purity of these plant isolates was 98.8%, 98.7%, 99.2%, 95.7%, and 98.5%, respectively. Compounds 1-5 exhibited an inhibitory effect on acetyl-cholinesterase and butyryl-cholinesterase with an IC50 from 1.47 to 23.24 microg/mL and 1.01 to 18.24 microg/mL. Molecular docking and inhibitory activities indicated that compound 1 showed stronger inhibitory activity on acetyl-cholinesterase and butyryl-cholinesterase.
