38257087|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that involves progressive cognitive decline accompanied by synaptic degeneration and impaired neurotransmission. Recent studies revealed that apple pomace, a waste byproduct of the apple processing industry, has beneficial health properties, but its potential to prevent and treat AD has not been determined. Herein, we examined the effects of apple pomace extract on N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist MK-801-induced memory impairment in mice. Repeated treatment with apple pomace extract for 7 days reversed the MK-801-induced impairment of associative memory and recognition memory. RNA sequencing revealed that repeated treatment with apple pomace extract altered the gene expression profile in the hippocampus of mice. Real-time PCR showed that apple pomace extract induced upregulation of the mRNA expression for Zfp125 and Gstp1. Furthermore, gene sets related to synapse and neurotransmission were upregulated by apple pomace extract. These findings indicate that apple pomace extract may be useful for the prevention and treatment of AD.
