36979885|t|A Preclinical Investigation on the Role of IgG Antibodies against Coagulant Components in Multiple Sclerosis.
36979885|a|The coagulation-inflammation interplay has recently been identified as a critical risk factor in the early onset of multiple sclerosis (MS), and antibodies against coagulation components have been recognized as contributing factors to thrombotic and inflammatory signaling pathways in diseases with overlapping symptoms to MS, paving the way for further research into their effects on MS pathology. The current study aimed to enlighten the role of IgG antibodies against coagulation components by performing a preclinical study, analyzing the astrocytic activation by purified IgG antibodies derived from 15 MS patients, and assessing their possible pro-inflammatory effects using a bead-based multiplexed immunoassay system. The results were compared with those obtained following astrocyte treatment with samples from 14 age- and gender-matched healthy donors, negative for IgG antibody presence. Serum samples collected from 167 MS patients and 40 age- and gender-matched controls were also analyzed for pro- and anti-inflammatory factors. According to our results, astrocytic activation in response to IgG treatment caused an upregulation of various pro-inflammatory factors, including cytokines, chemokines, and interleukins. Conversely, in serum samples from patients and controls, the pro-inflammatory factors did not differ significantly; medication may lower the levels in patients. Our findings suggest that antibodies may function as effectors in neuroinflammation and serve as targets for new treatments that eventually benefit novel therapeutic approaches.
