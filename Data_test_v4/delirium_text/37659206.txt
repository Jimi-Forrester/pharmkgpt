37659206|t|Exploring the therapeutic potential of natural compounds for Alzheimer's disease: Mechanisms of action and pharmacological properties.
37659206|a|Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a global public health priority characterized by high mortality rates in adults and an increasing prevalence in aging populations worldwide. Despite significant advancements in comprehending the pathogenesis of AD since its initial report in 1907, there remains a lack of effective curative or preventive measures for the disease. In recent years, natural compounds sourced from diverse origins have garnered considerable attention as potential therapeutic agents for AD, owing to their anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and neuroprotective properties. This review aims to consolidate the therapeutic effects of natural compounds on AD, specifically targeting the reduction of beta-amyloid (Abeta) overproduction, anti-apoptosis, autophagy, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Notably, the identified compounds exhibiting these effects predominantly originate from plants. This review provides valuable insights into the potential of natural compounds as a reservoir of novel therapeutic agents for AD, thereby stimulating further research and contributing to the development of efficacious treatments for this devastating disease.
