28547526|a|gamma-Secretase has been a therapeutical target for its key role in cleaving APP to generate beta-amyloid (Abeta), the primary constituents of senile plaques and a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. Recently, gamma-secretase-associating proteins showed promising role in specifically modulating APP processing while sparing Notch signaling; however, the underlying mechanism is still unclear. A co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) coupled with mass spectrometry proteomic assay for Presenilin1 (PS1, the catalytic subunit of gamma-secretase) was firstly conducted to find more gamma-secretase-associating proteins. Gene ontology analysis of these results identified Rab21 as a potential PS1 interacting protein, and the interaction between them was validated by reciprocal Co-IP and immunofluorescence assay. Then, molecular and biochemical methods were used to investigate the effect of Rab21 on APP processing. Results showed that overexpression of Rab21 enhanced Abeta generation, while silencing of Rab21 reduced the accumulation of Abeta, which resulted due to change in gamma-secretase activity rather than alpha- or beta-secretase. Finally, we demonstrated that Rab21 had no effect on gamma-secretase complex synthesis or metabolism but enhanced PS1 endocytosis and translocation to late endosome/lysosome. In conclusion, we identified a novel gamma-secretase-associating protein Rab21 and illustrate that Rab21 promotes gamma-secretase internalization and translocation to late endosome/lysosome. Moreover, silencing of Rab21 decreases the gamma-secretase activity in APP processing thus production of Abeta. All these results open new gateways towards the understanding of gamma-secretase-associating proteins in APP processing and make inhibition of Rab21 a promising strategy for AD therapy.
