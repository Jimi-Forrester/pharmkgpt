39702171|a|BACKGROUND: Protein expression analysis of isolated brain microvessels provides valuable insights into the function of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). However, isolation of brain microvessels from human brain tissue, particularly in small quantities, poses significant challenges. This study presents a method for isolating brain microvessels from a small amount of frozen human brain tissue, adapting techniques from an established mouse brain capillary isolation method. METHODS: Brain microvessel fractions were obtained from approximately 0.3 g of frozen human brain tissue (frontal cortex) using a bead homogenizer for homogenization, followed by purification with a combination of cell strainers and glass beads. Protein expression in the isolated human microvessel fractions and whole-brain lysates was analyzed by western blot and proteomic analysis. RESULTS: Microscopic imaging confirmed the successful isolation of brain microvessels from frozen human brain tissue. Protein quantification assays demonstrated that the microvessel fraction yielded sufficient protein for detailed expression analysis. Western blot analysis revealed an enrichment of BBB-selective proteins including multidrug resistance 1 (MDR1)/ATP-binding cassette sub-family B member 1 (ABCB1), glucose transporter protein type 1 (GLUT1)/solute carrier family 2 member 1 (SLC2A1), and claudin 5 (CLDN5), in the brain microvessel fraction compared to whole-brain lysates. Multiple reaction monitoring quantification of six BBB-selective proteins-MDR1, breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP)/ATP binding cassette subfamily G member 2 (ABCG2), GLUT1, monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1)/solute carrier family 16 member 1 (SLC16A1), transferrin receptor, and CLDN5-revealed expression levels consistent with those observed in larger human brain samples. Sequential Window Acquisition of all Theoretical Mass Spectra (SWATH-MS)-based quantitative proteomics further demonstrated significant enrichment of human microvascular endothelial cells in the isolated fraction, corroborating the findings from mouse models. CONCLUSIONS: We successfully developed a method for isolation of brain microvessels from a small amount of frozen human brain tissue, facilitating detailed study of BBB proteome in aging or pathological conditions. This technique provides valuable insights into BBB dysfunction in central nervous system disorders and holds potential for improving brain-targeted drug delivery strategies.
