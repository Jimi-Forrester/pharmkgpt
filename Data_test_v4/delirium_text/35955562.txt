35955562|a|Neuroinflammation is a key pathological event shared by different diseases affecting the nervous system. Since the underlying mechanism of neuroinflammation is a complex and multifaceted process, current pharmacological treatments are unsatisfactory-a reason why new therapeutic approaches are mandatory. In this context, the endocannabinoid system has proven to possess neuroprotective and immunomodulatory actions under neuroinflammatory status, and its modulation could represent a valuable approach to address different inflammatory processes. To this aim, we evaluated the efficacy of a repeated treatment with NSD1819, a potent beta-lactam-based monoacylglycerol lipase inhibitor in a mouse model of neuroinflammation induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection. Mice were intraperitoneally injected with LPS 1 mg/kg for five consecutive days to induce systemic inflammation. Concurrently, NSD1819 (3 mg/kg) was daily per os administered from day 1 until the end of the experiment (day 11). Starting from day 8, behavioral measurements were performed to evaluate the effect of the treatment on cognitive impairments, allodynia, motor alterations, anhedonia, and depressive-like behaviors evoked by LPS. Histologically, glial analysis of the spinal cord was also performed. The administration of NSD1819 was able to completely counteract thermal and mechanical allodynia as highlighted by the Cold plate and von Frey tests, respectively, and to reduce motor impairments as demonstrated by the Rota rod test. Moreover, the compound was capable of neutralizing the memory loss in the Passive avoidance test, and reducing depressive-like behavior in the Porsolt test. Finally, LPS stimulation caused a significant glial cells activation in the dorsal horn of the lumbar spinal cord that was significantly recovered by NSD1819 repeated treatment. In conclusion, NSD1819 was able to thwart the plethora of symptoms evoked by LPS, thus representing a promising candidate for future applications in the context of neuroinflammation and related diseases.
