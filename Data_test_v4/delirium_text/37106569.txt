METHODS: In this longitudinal study, a total of 269 patients with mild cognitive impairment or early dementia due to AD with the evidence of brain beta-amyloid deposition were followed-up for a mean period of 4 years. Five-year normalized hourly cumulative exposure value of each air pollutant, such as carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2 ), sulfur dioxide (SO2 ), and particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10 ), was computed based on nationwide air pollution database. The effects of chronic exposure to air pollution on longitudinal cognitive decline rate were evaluated using linear mixed models. RESULTS: Higher chronic exposure to SO2 was associated with a faster decline in memory score, whereas chronic exposure to CO, NO2 , and PM10 were not associated with the rate of cognitive decline. Higher chronic exposure to PM2.5 was associated with a faster decline in visuospatial score in apolipoprotein E epsilon4 carriers. These effects remained significant even after adjusting for potential confounders. INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggest that chronic exposure to SO2 and PM2.5 is associated with faster clinical progression in AD.
