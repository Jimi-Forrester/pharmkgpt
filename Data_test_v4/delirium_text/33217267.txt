33217267|t|Thyroid Storm, Rhabdomyolysis, and Pulmonary Embolism: An Unusual Triad Case Report.
33217267|a|INTRODUCTION: Thyroid storm is a medical emergency associated with significant mortality. Hyperthyroid states have been associated with hypercoagulability as well as rhabdomyolysis. However, the pathophysiology of this association remains under investigation. CASE REPORT: A 62-year-old male patient presented to the emergency department with weakness and was found to have thyroid storm with concurrent submassive pulmonary embolisms and rhabdomyolysis. To our knowledge, this is the first reported presentation of this triad. CONCLUSION: This case highlights the potentially difficult diagnosis and management of thyroid storm, as well as associated life-threatening complications, including venous thromboemboli and rhabdomyolysis.
