34983347|t|Imidazole: Multi-targeted Therapeutic Leads for the Management of Alzheimer's Disease.
34983347|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifactorial disorder coupled with an array of neuropathological mechanisms, including tau phosphorylation, Abeta aggregation, metal ion deregulation, and oxidative stress, along with neuro-inflammation. The clinically available drugs for the management of AD include four acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and one glutamatergic antagonist. These agents provide only temporary relief from the symptoms by altering the neurotransmitter level in the brain. OBJECTIVE: Keeping in view the focus on research, the numerous pharmacological activities associated with the aromatic diazole heterocyclic nucleus, imidazole, triggered the medicinal chemist to develop a large number of novel anti-AD compounds targeting multiple pathological mechanisms associated with AD. These prepared analogs represent a higher potential against neurological disorders, including AD. This review article aims an ornately pronounce the therapeutic voyage of imidazole and its analogs as anti-AD. METHODS: It emphasizes the synthesized imidazole derivatives as anti-AD with multiple targets reviewed from the data available on Pubmed. RESULTS: These compounds diminish the pathophysiological aspects of AD; still, further studies are required to prove the safety and efficacy of these compounds in humans. CONCLUSION: The review aims to provide knowledge and highlight the status of this moiety in the design and development of novel drug candidates against Alzheimer's disease conditions. Thus, it paves the way for further work.
