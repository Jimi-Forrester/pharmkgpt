37630643|t|Migraine as a Disease Associated with Dysbiosis and Possible Therapy with Fecal Microbiota Transplantation.
37630643|a|Migraine is a painful neurological condition characterized by severe pain on one or both sides of the head. It may be linked to changes in the gut microbiota, which are influenced by antibiotic use and other factors. Dysbiosis, which develops and persists as a result of earlier antibiotic therapy, changes the composition of the intestinal flora, and can lead to the development of various diseases such as metabolic disorders, obesity, hematological malignancies, neurological or behavioral disorders, and migraine. Metabolites produced by the gut microbiome have been shown to influence the gut-brain axis. The use of probiotics as a dietary supplement may reduce the number and severity of migraine episodes. Dietary strategies can affect the course of migraines and are a valuable tool for improving migraine management. With fecal microbiota transplantation, gut microbial restoration is more effective and more durable. Changes after fecal microbiota transplantation were studied in detail, and many data help us to interpret the successful interventions. The microbiological alteration of the gut microflora can lead to normalization of the inflammatory mediators, the serotonin pathway, and influence the frequency and intensity of migraine pain.
