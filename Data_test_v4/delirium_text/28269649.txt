28269649|a|Astrocytes actively influence the behavior of the surrounding neuronal network including changes of the synaptic plasticity and neuronal excitability. These dynamics are altered in diseases like Alzheimer's, where the release of the gliotransmitter GABA is increased by affected, so called reactive astrocytes. In this paper, we aim to simulate a neural network with altered astrocytic GABA release. Therefore, we use our developed neuron-astrocyte model, called INEXA, which includes astrocyte controlled tripartite synapses and the astrocyte-astrocyte interaction. Our results show that GABA released by astrocytes may be responsible for synchronous inhibition of postsynaptic neurons. With increased GABA inhibition, the spike and burst rate decreased while the burst duration and spikes per burst remain similar. To our knowledge, it is the first time that the effect of this gliotransmitter to the neural network was simulated.
