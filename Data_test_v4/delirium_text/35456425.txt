35456425|t|Gut Microbiota Feature of Senile Osteoporosis by Shallow Shotgun Sequencing Using Aged Rats Model.
35456425|a|Senile osteoporosis is defined as an age-related bone metabolic disorder, which is characterized by bone loss and decreased bone fragility. Gut microbiota (GM) could regulate the bone metabolic process and be closely related to senile osteoporosis. Several genus-level GM were found to increase in osteoporotic animals and patients. However, to reveal the pathogenic bacteria in senile osteoporosis, further studies are still needed to investigate the complete characteristics of bacteria species. In the present study, the rats were equally divided into two groups: the control group (Con, 6-month-old) and the osteoporosis group (OP, 22-month-old). Fecal samples were freshly collected to conduct the shallow shotgun sequencing. Then, we compared the species numbers, microbial diversity, GM composition at genus and species-level, and functional metabolic pathways in the two groups. The results showed that the species number was lower in the OP group (1272) than in the control group (1413), and 1002 GM species were shared between the two groups. The OP group had the decreased alpha diversity compared with the control group. As for beta diversity, The PCA revealed that samples in the two groups had distinguishable ecological distance in each coordinate. At the species level, Bacteroide coprocola (B. coprocola), Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii), Parabacteroides distasonis (P. distasonis), and Prevotella copri (P. copri) were higher in the OP group, while Corynebacterium stationis (C. stationis), Akkermansia muciniphila (A. muciniphila), and Alistipes indistinctus (A. indistinctus) were decreased. Moreover, functional metabolic analysis revealed that metabolic pathways of fatty acid biosynthesis, valine/isoleucine biosynthesis, GABA biosynthesis, and ubiquinone biosynthesis were enriched in the senile osteoporotic rats. In conclusion, GM at the species level in senile osteoporotic rats was significantly altered in structure, composition, and function. The altered GM structure, increased GM species such as P. copri, and decreased GM species such as A. muciniphila might be linked with the development of senile osteoporosis.
