35084341|t|Patterns of Symptom Tracking by Caregivers and Patients With Dementia and Mild Cognitive Impairment: Cross-sectional Study.
35084341|a|BACKGROUND: Individuals with dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) experience a wide variety of symptoms and challenges that trouble them. To address this heterogeneity, numerous standardized tests are used for diagnosis and prognosis. myGoalNav Dementia is a web-based tool that allows individuals with impairments and their caregivers to identify and track outcomes of greatest importance to them, which may be a less arbitrary and more sensitive way of capturing meaningful change. OBJECTIVE: We aim to explore the most frequent and important symptoms and challenges reported by caregivers and people with dementia and MCI and how this varies according to disease severity. METHODS: This cross-sectional study involved 3909 web-based myGoalNav users (mostly caregivers of people with dementia or MCI) who completed symptom profiles between 2006 and 2019. To make a symptom profile, users selected their most personally meaningful or troublesome dementia-related symptoms to track over time. Users were also asked to rank their chosen symptoms from least to most important, which we called the symptom potency. As the stage of disease for these web-based users was unknown, we applied a supervised staging algorithm, previously trained on clinician-derived data, to classify each profile into 1 of 4 stages: MCI and mild, moderate, and severe dementia. Across these stages, we compared symptom tracking frequency, symptom potency, and the relationship between frequency and potency. RESULTS: Applying the staging algorithm to the 3909 user profiles resulted in 917 (23.46%) MCI, 1596 (40.83%) mild dementia, 514 (13.15%) moderate dementia, and 882 (22.56%) severe dementia profiles. We found that the most frequent symptoms in MCI and mild dementia profiles were similar and comprised early hallmarks of dementia (eg, recent memory and language difficulty). As the stage increased to moderate and severe, the most frequent symptoms were characteristic of loss of independent function (eg, incontinence) and behavioral problems (eg, aggression). The most potent symptoms were similar between stages and generally reflected disruptions in everyday life (eg, problems with hobbies or games, travel, and looking after grandchildren). Symptom frequency was negatively correlated with potency at all stages, and the strength of this relationship increased with increasing disease severity. CONCLUSIONS: Our results emphasize the importance of patient-centricity in MCI and dementia studies and illustrate the valuable real-world evidence that can be collected with digital tools. Here, the most frequent symptoms across the stages reflected our understanding of the typical disease progression. However, the symptoms that were ranked as most personally important by users were generally among the least frequently selected. Through individualization, patient-centered instruments such as myGoalNav can complement standardized measures by capturing these infrequent but potent outcomes.
