38697556|a|OBJECTIVE: Ferroptosis has been recognized as being closely associated with cognitive impairment. Research has established that Alzheimer's disease (AD)-associated proteins, such as amyloid precursor protein (APP) and phosphorylated tau, are involved in brain iron metabolism. These proteins are found in high concentrations within senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) offers a non-pharmacological approach to AD treatment. This study aims to explore the potential therapeutic effects of rTMS on cognitive impairment through the modulation of the ferroptosis pathway, thereby laying both a theoretical and experimental groundwork for the application of rTMS in treating Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: The study utilized senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8 (SAMP8) mice to model brain aging-related cognitive impairment, with senescence-accelerated-mouse resistant 1 (SAMR1) mice acting as controls. The SAMP8 mice were subjected to high-frequency rTMS at 25 Hz for durations of 14 and 28 days. Cognitive function was evaluated using behavioral tests. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) assessed alterations in cerebral activity by measuring the fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF) of the blood oxygen level-dependent signal. Neuronal recovery post-rTMS in the SAMP8 model was examined via HE and Nissl staining. Immunohistochemistry was employed to detect the expression of APP and Phospho-Tau (Thr231). Oxidative stress markers were quantified using biochemical assay kits. ELISA methods were utilized to measure hippocampal levels of Fe2+ and Abeta1-42. Finally, the expression of proteins related to the ferroptosis pathway was determined through western blot analysis. RESULTS: The findings indicate that 25 Hz rTMS enhances cognitive function and augments cerebral activity in SAMP8 model mice. Treatment with rTMS in these mice resulted in diminished oxidative stress and safeguarded neurons against damage. Additionally, iron accumulation was mitigated, and the expression of ferroptosis pathway proteins Gpx4, system Xc-, and Nrf2 was elevated. CONCLUSIONS: The Tau/APP-Fe-GPX4/system Xc-/Nrf2 pathway is implicated in the remedial effects of rTMS on cognitive dysfunction, offering a theoretical and experimental basis for employing rTMS in AD treatment.
