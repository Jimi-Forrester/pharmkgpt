29251649|t|Zolpidem Overdose: A Dilemma in Mental Health.
29251649|a|Sleeping pills are one of the most common drugs taken by adults when afflicted by insomnia. Adverse effects of pharmacotherapy, however, should not be overlooked, and monitoring is needed to check for an overdose of sleeping pills. We reviewed zolpidem overdose and patient suicide with benefits and disadvantages of pharmacotherapy. Cases of adverse effects concerning the central nervous system, including delirium and hallucination, as well as abnormal behavior during sleep, are commonly reported among patients who have taken zolpidem for more than 1 year. The serious problem of long-term prescription to medication can lead to a higher mortality rate of insomniac patients. An alternative to medication for treating insomnia is cognitive behavioral therapy, which can improve sleeping habits. Cognitive behavioral therapy induces patients to recognize and change the negative thoughts that affect their sleep. Medical providers should be aware of the adverse effects of sleep inducers and provide sufficient information to their patients about them. When establishing treatment plans, they should encourage patients to make the proper decisions and try to reduce the adverse effects of any medication as much as possible.
