35866220|t|A Review of African Medicinal Plants and Functional Foods for the Management of Alzheimer's Disease-related Phenotypes, Treatment of HSV-1 Infection and/or Improvement of Gut Microbiota.
35866220|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder is the most common form of dementia globally. Several studies have suggested alteration in the gut microbiota and HSV-1 infection as contributing factors to the development of the disease. As at now, there are no AD attenuating agents and AD pharmacotherapy is focused on managing symptoms while plants used in ethnomedicine remain potential sources of drugs for the treatment of the condition. Here, we reviewed published databases for African ethnomedicinal plants and functional foods of African origin that are used in the management of AD-related phenotypes, treatment of herpes simplex virus -1 (HSV-1) and/or improvement of gut microbiota. A total of 101 unique plant species and 24 different types of traditionally prepared African functional foodstuff were identified. Of the 101 identified plant species, 50 species serve as functional foodstuffs. Twenty-three (23) of the ethnomedicinal plant families were successfully identified for the treatment and management of AD-related phenotypes and age-related dementia. Eighteen (18) African plant species from 15 families were also identified as potent remedies for HSV-1; while many African wild fruits (3 species), roots and tubers (7 species), leafy vegetables (14 species), and seaweeds (26 species) were functional foods for modifying AD-related phenotypes. It was concluded that African medicinal plants are potential sources of both AD attenuating agents and phytocompounds that may be used against HSV-1 infection and alteration of gut microbiota. Additionally, a number of African functional foods are important sources of prebiotics and probiotics.
