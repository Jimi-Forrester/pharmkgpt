37225031|t|Nanoarchitectonic approaches for measuring the catalytic behavior of a membrane anchored enzyme. From Langmuir-Blodgett to a novel Langmuir-Schaefer based nanofilm building device.
37225031|a|Self-organized lipid monolayers at the air-water interface (Langmuir films, LF) are commonly used for measuring the catalytic properties of membrane-bound enzymes. This methodology allows to provide a consistent flat topography molecular density, packing defects and thickness. The aim of the present work was to show the methodological advantages of using the horizontal transfer method (Langmuir-Schaefer) with respect to the vertical transfer method (Langmuir-Blodgett) when mounting a device to measure catalytic activity of membrane enzymes. Based on the results obtained we can conclude that it is possible to prepare stable Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) and Langmuir-Schaefer (LS) films from Bovine Erythrocyte Membranes (BEM) preserving the catalytic activity of its native Acetylcholinesterase (BEA). In comparison, the LS films showed Vmax values more similar to the enzyme present in the vesicles of natural membranes. In addition, it was much easier to produce large amounts of transferred areas with the horizontal transfer methodology. It was possible to decrease the time required to mount an assay with numerous activity points, such as building activity curves as a function of substrate concentration. The present results show that LSBEM provides a proof of concept for the development of biosensors based on transferred purified membrane for the screening of new products acting on an enzyme embedded on its natural milieu. In the case of BEA, the application of these enzymatic sensors could have medical interest, providing drug screening tools for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
