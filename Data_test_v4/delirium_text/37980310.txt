37980310|t|Electroacupuncture Improves Learning and Memory Abilities via Activating AMPK/mTOR-Induced Autophagy in APP/PS1 Mice.
37980310|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) has become a global public health problem characterized by memory and cognitive impairments. Electroacupuncture (EA) has been indicated to exert promising therapeutic effects on AD. This study aimed to further investigate the underlying mechanism of EA in AD treatment. APP/PS1 transgenic mice and wide-type mice underwent with or without EA treatment at GV20 and BL23 acupoints. Morris water maze test was utilized for examining the learning and memory of mice. Hematoxylin-eosin, Congo red, immunofluorescence, and TUNEL staining were employed for detecting the pathological changes of mouse brain hippocampus. Western blotting was implemented for measuring protein levels of autophagy- and AMPK/mTOR pathway-associated markers. APP/PS1 mice exhibited significant impairments in the spatial learning and memory. EA treatment improved the cognitive impairments, reduced amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposition, and alleviated neuronal apoptosis in the hippocampal tissues of APP/PS1 mice. EA promoted autophagy and activated the AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice. EA improves the cognitive deficits, enhances Abeta clearance, and attenuates neuronal apoptosis in APP/PS1 mice in part by activating AMPK/mTOR-mediated autophagy.
