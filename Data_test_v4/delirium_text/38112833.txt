38112833|a|BACKGROUND: Precision medicine has transformed cancer treatment by focusing on personalized approaches based on genomic abnormalities. However, comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) and access to targeted therapies are limited in Japan. This study investigates the BELIEVE trial, which aims to improve drug accessibility for patients with actionable genetic abnormalities through off-label drug administration. METHODS: The BELIEVE trial is a platform trial with a single master protocol, conducted under the Clinical Trials Act and the patient-proposed health services (PPHS) scheme. Eligible patients with solid tumors exhibiting actionable alterations were enrolled, and CGP tests covered by national health insurance were employed. Treatment selection, study drugs from collaborating pharmaceutical companies, and treatment schedules adhered to predefined protocols. Primary and secondary endpoints were evaluated, and statistical analysis was conducted based on patient response rates. RESULTS: The BELIEVE trial offered treatment opportunities for patients with relapse/refractory disease who lacked standard therapies or clinical trial options. This study addresses unmet medical needs and contributes to the establishment of precision medicine systems. Similar trials like NCI-MATCH and TAPUR are being conducted globally. The BELIEVE trial provides a platform for off-label drug administration, collects essential clinical data, and contributes to drug approval applications. CONCLUSION: The BELIEVE trial provides hope for patients with actionable genetic abnormalities by facilitating access to targeted therapies through off-label drug administration. It establishes a regulatory framework and promotes collaboration between industry and academia by expanding organ-specific and cross-organ biomarker-based treatments.
