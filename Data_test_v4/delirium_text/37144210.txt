37144210|a|Introduction: Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurological disorder. Patients with PD were affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in many different ways. This study's principal purpose is to assess PD patients' vulnerability to COVID-19 and its consequences. Method: This systematic review was performed based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyzes (PRISMA) guidelines. A thorough search was conducted in the Medline (through PubMed) and Scopus databases from inception to January 30, 2022. The Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal checklist was used to evaluate the studies. Results: Most of the studies (38%) had been conducted in Italy. Of the total number of studies, 17 (58%) were cross-sectional, seven (22%) were cohort, four (12%) were quasiexperimental, two (6%) were case-control, and one (3%) was a qualitative study. The PD duration in patients ranged from 3.26 to 13.40 years (IQR1: 5.7 yrs., median: 3.688 yrs., and IQR3: 8.815 yrs.). Meanwhile, the sample size ranged from 12 to 30872 participants (IQR1: 46, median: 96, and IQR3: 211). Despite worsening PD symptoms in the targeted population (persons with COVID-19 and Parkinson's disease), some studies found PD to be a risk factor for more severe COVID-19 disease. There are many adverse effects during the pandemic period in PD patients such as abnormalities of motor, nonmotor functioning, clinical outcomes, activities of daily living, and other outcomes. Conclusion: This study confirmed the negative effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on health-related quality of life and its determinants in patients with PD and their caregivers. Thus, due to the worsening symptoms of PD patients in the current pandemic, these people should be given more care and supervision to minimize their coronavirus exposure.
