33669361|t|Context-Dependent Roles of RNA Modifications in Stress Responses and Diseases.
33669361|a|RNA modifications are diverse post-transcriptional modifications that regulate RNA metabolism and gene expression. RNA modifications, and the writers, erasers, and readers that catalyze these modifications, serve as important signaling machineries in cellular stress responses and disease pathogenesis. In response to stress, RNA modifications are mobilized to activate or inhibit the signaling pathways that combat stresses, including oxidative stress, hypoxia, therapeutic stress, metabolic stress, heat shock, DNA damage, and ER stress. The role of RNA modifications in response to these cellular stressors is context- and cell-type-dependent. Due to their pervasive roles in cell biology, RNA modifications have been implicated in the pathogenesis of different diseases, including cancer, neurologic and developmental disorders and diseases, and metabolic diseases. In this review, we aim to summarize the roles of RNA modifications in molecular and cellular stress responses and diseases.
