38613351|a|Autophagy is a cellular process that is evolutionarily conserved, involving the sequestration of damaged organelles and proteins into autophagic vesicles, which subsequently fuse with lysosomes for degradation. Autophagy controls the development of many diseases by influencing apoptosis, inflammation, the immune response and different cellular processes. Autophagy plays a significant role in the aetiology of disorders associated with dentistry. Autophagy controls odontogenesis. Furthermore, it is implicated in the pathophysiology of pulpitis and periapical disorders. It enhances the survival, penetration and colonization of periodontal pathogenic bacteria into the host periodontal tissues and facilitates their escape from host defences. Autophagy plays a crucial role in mitigating exaggerated inflammatory reactions within the host's system during instances of infection and inflammation. Autophagy also plays a role in the relationship between periodontal disease and systemic diseases. Autophagy promotes wound healing and may enhance implant osseointegration. This study reviews autophagy's dento-alveolar effects, focusing on its role in odontogenesis, periapical diseases, periodontal diseases and dental implant surgery, providing valuable insights for dentists on tooth development and dental applications. A thorough examination of autophagy has the potential to discover novel and efficacious treatment targets within the field of dentistry.
