35883145|a|As in neurons, CNS myelin expresses N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Receptors (NMDARs) that subserve physiological roles, but have the potential to induce injury to this vital element. Using 2-photon imaging of myelinic Ca in live ex vivo mouse optic nerves, we show that Cu ions potently modulate Ca levels in an NMDAR-dependent manner. Chelating Cu in the perfusate induced a substantial increase in Ca levels, and also caused significant axo-myelinic injury. Myelinic NMDARs are shown to be regulated by cellular prion protein; only in prion protein KO optic nerves does application of NMDA + D-serine induce a large Ca increase, consistent with strong desensitization of these receptors in the presence of prion protein limiting Ca overload. Abeta1-42 peptide induced a large Ca increase that was also Cu-dependent, and was blocked by NMDAR antagonism. Our results indicate that like in neurons, myelinic NMDARs permeate potentially injurious amounts of Ca, and are also potently regulated by micromolar Cu and activated by Abeta1-42 peptides. These findings shed mechanistic light on the important primary white matter injury frequently observed in Alzheimer's brain.
