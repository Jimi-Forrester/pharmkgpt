27683352|a|Free radicals especially reactive oxygen metabolites can damage DNA, protein, enzymes, and membrane lipids. Lipid peroxidation in hepatocyte membrane may be involved in hepatic diseases. Antioxidants may inhibit this reaction. Due to oxidant-antioxidant imbalance, free radicals may cause destructive effects. For several years, scientists tried to find antioxidant compounds. In this study, the effects of lycopene and ubiquinol-10 on the oxidative stress in rat hepatocytes induced by t-buthyl hydroperoxide was determined. First, rat hepatocytes were isolated and then incubated in the presence of tert-buthyl hydroperoxide and the amount of malondialdehyde, as a marker of lipid peroxidation, was determined. Then, this reaction was performed in the presence of various concentrations of each lycopene and ubiquinol-10, and the malondialdehyde level was determined. The results of this study showed that in the presence of various concentrations of lycopene and ubiquinol-10 the levels of lipid peroxidation products significantly decreased (P<0.05). Thus, lycopene and ubiquinol-10 have inhibitory effects on lipid peroxidation reaction. This study showed the potential utility of lycopene and ubiquinol-10 in prevention of hepatic dysfunction.
