37297846|t|Anesthesia and Perioperative Management for Surgical Correction of Neuromuscular Scoliosis in Children: A Narrative Review.
37297846|a|Scoliosis is the most frequent spinal deformity in children. It is defined as a spine deviation of more than 10  in the frontal plane. Neuromuscular scoliosis is associated with a heterogeneous spectrum of muscular or neurological symptoms. Anesthesia and surgery for neuromuscular scoliosis have a higher risk of perioperative complications than for idiopathic scoliosis. However, patients and their relatives report improved quality of life after the surgery. The challenges for the anesthetic team result from the specifics of the anesthesia, the scoliosis surgery itself, or factors associated with neuromuscular disorders. This article includes details of preanesthetic evaluation, intraoperative management, and postoperative care in the intensive care unit from an anesthetic view. In summary, adequate care for patients who have neuromuscular scoliosis requires interdisciplinary cooperation. This comprehensive review covers information about the perioperative management of neuromuscular scoliosis for all healthcare providers who take care of these patients during the perioperative period, with an emphasis on anesthesia management.
