34336287|t|Modulatory Effect of Probiotics on Proinflammatory Cytokine Levels in Acrylamide-Treated Rats.
34336287|a|The aims of this study are to investigate the effect of acrylamide on the level of proinflammatory cytokines in the blood of acrylamide-treated rats and to find the modulatory impact of probiotics on those cytokines. Thirty-two rats were divided into four groups: rats which received 20 mg acrylamide, acrylamide with 20 mg probiotics, acrylamide with 200 mg probiotics, and standard water and food (groups 1-4, respectively). The serum levels of cytokines were measured on days 0, 15, and 30. Group 1 showed an increased serum level of IL-1beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha after 15 days, and they decreased in day 30. Serum IL-6 level was significantly decreased on days 15 and 30 in rats in group 2 compared to the controls. TNF-alpha and IL-1beta levels were not statistically different after treated with probiotics. The exposure of rats to acrylamide led to increased systemic inflammation as evidenced by higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines, and probiotics can modulate this inflammation.
