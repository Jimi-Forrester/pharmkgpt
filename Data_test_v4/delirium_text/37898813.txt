37898813|a|BACKGROUND: While ageing is associated with increased insulin resistance (IR), the molecular mechanisms underlying increased IR in the muscle, the primary organ for glucose clearance, have yet to be elucidated in older individuals. As epigenetic processes are suggested to contribute to the development of ageing-associated diseases, we investigated whether differential DNA methylation was associated with IR in human primary muscle stem cells (myoblasts) from community-dwelling older individuals. METHODS: We measured DNA methylation (Infinium HumanMethylationEPIC BeadChip) in myoblast cultures from vastus lateralis biopsies (119 males/females, mean age 78.24 years) from the Hertfordshire Sarcopenia Study extension (HSSe) and examined differentially methylated cytosine phosphate guanine (CpG) sites (dmCpG), regions (DMRs) and gene pathways associated with HOMA2-IR, an index for the assessment of insulin resistance, and levels of glycated hemoglobin HbA1c. RESULTS: Thirty-eight dmCpGs (false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05) were associated with HOMA2-IR, with dmCpGs enriched in genes linked with JNK, AMPK and insulin signaling. The methylation signal associated with HOMA2-IR was attenuated after the addition of either BMI (6 dmCpGs), appendicular lean mass index (ALMi) (7 dmCpGs), grip strength (15 dmCpGs) or gait speed (23 dmCpGs) as covariates in the model. There were 8 DMRs (Stouffer < 0.05) associated with HOMA2-IR, including DMRs within T-box transcription factor (TBX1) and nuclear receptor subfamily-2 group F member-2 (NR2F2); the DMRs within TBX1 and NR2F2 remained associated with HOMA2-IR after adjustment for BMI, ALMi, grip strength or gait speed. Forty-nine dmCpGs and 21 DMRs were associated with HbA1c, with cg13451048, located within exoribonuclease family member 3 (ERI3) associated with both HOMA2-IR and HbA1c. HOMA2-IR and HbA1c were not associated with accelerated epigenetic ageing. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that insulin resistance is associated with differential DNA methylation in human primary myoblasts with both muscle mass and body composition making a significant contribution to the methylation changes associated with IR.
