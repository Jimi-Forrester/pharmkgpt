32796747|t|The Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor (MS-275) Promotes Differentiation of Human Dental Pulp Stem Cells into Odontoblast-Like Cells Independent of the MAPK Signaling System.
32796747|a|The role of dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) in dental tissue regeneration is gaining attention because DPSCs can differentiate into odontoblasts and other specialized cell types. Epigenetic modification has been found to play an important role in cell differentiation and regulation, among which histone deacetylase (HDAC) is involved in suppressing genes by removing histone acetyl groups. The use of HDAC inhibitor to control this is increasing and has been widely studied by many researchers. This study aimed to induce differentiation by causing epigenetic changes in odontoblast-related genes and the MAPK signaling pathway in human dental pulp stem cells. Western blot and immunofluorescence staining showed increased expression of DMP-1, ALP, DSPP, and RUNX2 compared to the control. However, activation of the MAPK signaling system was similar to but slightly different from the expression of odontoblast-related proteins. After 3 days, as shown by MTT and LDH assays, proliferation decreased overall, but cytotoxicity decreased at only a specific concentration. We confirmed that there was no change in mRNA expression of caspase 3 or 9 using real-time PCR. In addition, flow cytometry analysis confirmed that differentiation occurred due to the decrease in the expression of the CD73 and CD146. Although overall proliferation was reduced due to the G2/M inhibition of the cell cycle, the expression of BCL-2 protected the cells from cell death. Overall, cell proliferation decreased in response to MS-275, but it did not induce cytotoxicity in 5 nM and 10 nM concentration and induces differentiation into odontoblast-like cells.
