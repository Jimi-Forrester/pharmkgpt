34845679|a|Nanostructure lipid carriers (NLCs) were developed for the delivery of curmumin (CRN), a potent anticancer agent with low bioavailability, for the treatment of prostate cancer. NLCs prepared using high pressure homogenization (HPH) with around 150 nm particle size, - 40 V zeta-potential and excellent long-term stability. Cellular uptake of CRN-SLN showed nanoparticle localization in the cytoplasm around the nucleus. CRN-NLCs were assessed using flow cytometry and found to cause early and late apoptotic events at 100 mug/ml CRN concentrations. CRN-NLC nanoparticles were administrated to nude mice with LNCaP prostate cancer xenografts and demonstrated substantial tumour volume suppression (40%) with no weight loss compared to pure CRN (ethanolic solution). Overall, NLCs were proved a suitable carrier for passive drug delivery and cancer treatment.
