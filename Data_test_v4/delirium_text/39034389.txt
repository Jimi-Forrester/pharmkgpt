39034389|a|BACKGROUND: Females represent approximately 70% of the Alzheimer's disease (AD) cases and the literature has proposed a connection between the decreased estrogen levels during menopause and an increased AD risk. Previous investigations have predominantly focused on assessing how hormone therapy (HT) affects the likelihood of AD development and cognitive deterioration. However, as the research framework has shifted toward a biomarker-defined AD and alterations in specific biomarkers could take place years before cognitive decline becomes discernible, it is crucial to examine how HT influences AD biomarkers. The main goal of this study was to evaluate the impact of HT on AD biomarker-informed pathophysiology in both cognitively unimpaired (CU) and cognitively impaired (CI) post-menopausal females across the aging and AD spectrum. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included post-menopausal females without HT history (HT-) and with HT (HT+) at the time of PET imaging assessment from two cohorts: the Translational Biomarkers in Aging and Dementia (TRIAD) cohort, and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Participants underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET) and biofluid collection. Voxel-based t-tests were performed to assess the differences in amyloid-beta (Abeta) and tau neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) loads between HT- and HT + females. Linear regression models with interaction terms were also conducted to examine the interactive effects of HT and Abeta-PET on regional tau-PET. RESULTS: HT + females demonstrated significantly lower tau-PET standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) in Braak I-II ROIs (P < 0.05, Hedges' g = 0.73), Braak III-IV ROIs (P < 0.0001, Hedges' g = 0.74) and Braak V-VI ROIs (P < 0.0001, Hedges' g = 0.69) compared to HT- females. HT + females also showed significantly lower CSF p-tau181 (P < 0.001) and plasma p-tau181 (P < 0.0001) concentrations. Additionally, results from multivariate linear regression models indicated that HT interacts with cortical Abeta and is associated with lower regional NFT load. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, findings from this observational study suggest that HT is associated with lower tau neuroimaging and fluid biomarkers in postmenopausal females. Due to the close link between tau and cognition, this study highlights the need for large randomized controlled trials designed to systemically study the influences of HT on AD biomarkers and disease progression.
