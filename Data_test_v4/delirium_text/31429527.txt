The pathological manifestations of abnormal glucose metabolism in the nervous system of sporadic Alzheimer's disease (SAD) may affect synaptic plasticity, thus causing memory damage. As a traditional Chinese medicine compound preparation, the mechanism by which Shenzhiling (SZL) oral liquid can alleviate the cognitive impairment of SAD by improving synaptic plasticity remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: This article mainly discusses whether SZL can exert a protective synaptic effect as mediated by glutamate receptors and glycogen synthesis kinase 3beta (GSK3beta); further, it discusses whether SZL can improve cognitive function in SAD. METHODS: C57BL/6 mice were used as a SAD model after injection with streptozotocin (STZ) into the bilateral lateral ventricles; mice of the same background were injected with artificial cerebrospinal fluid into bilateral ventricles and were used as a control group. After 3 months of exposure to the intervention, the step-down test was carried out. Western blot was used to detect the levels of NMDAR2B, p-NMDAR2B, mGlu5, GSK3beta, and p-GSK3beta in the hippocampus of mice. Immunohistochemical analysis was used to observe the number of GSK3beta-positive cells in the CA1 region of mouse hippocampus. RESULTS: The memory retention ability of mice was significantly improved after 3 months of SZL treatment, and the expression levels of NMDAR2B, mGlu5, and GSK3beta were significantly changed. CONCLUSION: Shenzhiling provides a potential for the treatment for SAD with traditional Chinese medicine.
