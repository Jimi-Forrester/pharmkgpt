30958345|t|Greater Regional Cortical Thickness is Associated with Selective Vulnerability to Atrophy in Alzheimer's Disease, Independent of Amyloid Load and APOE Genotype.
30958345|a|BACKGROUND: Regional cortical thickness (rCTh) among cognitively normal (CN) adults (rCThCN) varies greatly between brain regions, as does the vulnerability to neurodegeneration. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to: 1) rank order rCThCN for various brain regions, and 2) explore their vulnerability to neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD) within these brain regions. METHODS: The relationship between rCTh among the CN group (rCThCN) and the percent difference in CTh (% CThDiff) in each region between the CN group and AD patients was examined. Pearson correlation analysis was performed accounting for amyloid-beta (Abeta) protein and APOE genotype using 210 age, gender, and APOE matched CN (n = 105, age range: 56-90) and AD (n = 105, age range: 56-90) ADNI participants. RESULTS: Strong positive correlations were observed between rCThCN and % CThDiff accounting for Abeta deposition and APOE status. Regions, such as the entorhinal cortex, which had the greatest CTh in the CN state, were also the regions which had the greatest % CThDiff. CONCLUSIONS: Regions with the greatest CTh at the CN stage are found to aggregate in disease prone regions of AD, namely in the medial temporal lobe, including the temporal pole, ERC, parahippocampal gyrus, fusiform and the middle and inferior temporal gyrus. Although rCTh has been found to vary considerably across the different regions of the brain, our results indicate that regions with the greatest CTh at the CN stage are actually regions which have been found to be most vulnerable to neurodegeneration in AD.
