14559363|a|By comparing the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteome between Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and controls, it may be possible to identify proteins that play a role in the disease process and thus to study the pathogenesis of AD. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE), SYPRO Ruby staining and mass spectrometry were used for clinical screening of disease-influenced CSF proteins in AD patients compared to controls. In order to increase the detection of CSF proteins and to improve the separation of protein isoforms in a 2-D gel, micro-narrow range IPG strips were used. The levels of eight proteins and their isoforms, including apolipoprotein A1, apolipoprotein E, apolipoprotein J, beta-trace, retinol-binding protein, kininogen, alpha-1 antitrypsin, cell cycle progression 8 protein, and alpha-1beta glycoprotein were significantly altered in CSF of AD patients compared to controls. Furthermore, we also used liquid-phase IEF, as a prefractionation step, prior to 2-DE for comparison of CSF proteins between individual AD patients and controls. The levels of 37 proteins spots were altered in AD patients. One of the identified proteins, alpha-2-HS glycoprotein, has not previously been linked to AD. Our study shows that several glycoproteins are altered in AD.
