18950780|t|Immobilized butyrylcholinesterase in the characterization of new inhibitors that could ease Alzheimer's disease.
18950780|a|Focus of this work was the development and characterization of a new immobilized enzyme reactor (IMER) containing human recombinant butyrylcholinesterase (rBChE) for the on-line kinetic characterization of specific, pseudo-irreversible and brain-targeted BChE inhibitors as potential drug candidates for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Specifically, a rBChE-IMER containing 0.99 U of covalently bound target enzyme was purposely developed and inserted into a HPLC system connected to a UV-vis detector. Selected reversible cholinesterase inhibitors, (-)-phenserine and (-)-cymserine analogues, were then kinetically characterized by rBChE-IMER, and by classical in solution assays and their carbamoylation and decarbamoylation constants were determined. The results support the elucidation of the potency, inhibition duration, mode of action and specific structure/activity relations of these agents and allow cross-validation of the two assay techniques.
