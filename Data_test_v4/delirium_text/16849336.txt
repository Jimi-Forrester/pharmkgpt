16849336|t|Neuroserpin binds Abeta and is a neuroprotective component of amyloid plaques in Alzheimer disease.
16849336|a|Alzheimer disease is characterized by extracellular plaques composed of Abeta peptides. We show here that these plaques also contain the serine protease inhibitor neuroserpin and that neuroserpin forms a 1:1 binary complex with the N-terminal or middle parts of the Abeta(1-42) peptide. This complex inactivates neuroserpin as an inhibitor of tissue plasminogen activator and blocks the loop-sheet polymerization process that is characteristic of members of the serpin superfamily. In contrast neuroserpin accelerates the aggregation of Abeta(1-42) with the resulting species having an appearance that is distinct from the mature amyloid fibril. Neuroserpin reduces the cytotoxicity of Abeta(1-42) when assessed using standard cell assays, and the interaction has been confirmed in vivo in novel Drosophila models of disease. Taken together, these data show that neuroserpin interacts with Abeta(1-42) to form off-pathway non-toxic oligomers and so protects neurons in Alzheimer disease.
