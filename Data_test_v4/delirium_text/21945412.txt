21945412|t|Off-label gabapentin masking ictal triphasic waves: case analysis of neuropsychiatric and electrographic correlates.
21945412|a|Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are frequently used off-label for the treatment of psychiatric, pain, and other neurological disorders. Off-label AED use may confound the diagnosis for acute neuropsychiatric changes associated with delirium by fortuitously treating, or partially treating, underlying seizure disorders while masking ictal electrographic patterns on EEGs. Standard video/EEG monitoring includes weaning from AEDs to maximize ictal activity and better determine seizure focus. We report a case of off-label gabapentin use masking ictal electrographic activity, the neuropsychiatric and electrographic consequences of discontinuing gabapentin, and the therapeutic response when gabapentin was re-initiated and titrated to a total daily dose greater than that at time of admission. Weaning from AEDs with concurrent video/EEG monitoring is an important diagnostic tool in these complex cases.
