32101780|t|Novel small molecule therapeutic agents for Alzheimer disease: Focusing on BACE1 and multi-target directed ligands.
32101780|a|Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that effects 50 million people worldwide. In this review, AD pathology and the development of novel therapeutic agents targeting AD were fully discussed. In particular, common approaches to prevent Abeta production and/or accumulation in the brain including alpha-secretase activators, specific gamma-secretase modulators and small molecules BACE1 inhibitors were reviewed. Additionally, natural-origin bioactive compounds that provide AD therapeutic advances have been introduced. Considering AD is a multifactorial disease, the therapeutic potential of diverse multi target-directed ligands (MTDLs) that combine the efficacy of cholinesterase (ChE) inhibitors, MAO (monoamine oxidase) inhibitors, BACE1 inhibitors, phosphodiesterase 4D (PDE4D) inhibitors, for the treatment of AD are also reviewed. This article also highlights descriptions on the regulator of serotonin receptor (5-HT), metal chelators, anti-aggregants, antioxidants and neuroprotective agents targeting AD. Finally, current computational methods for evaluating the structure-activity relationships (SAR) and virtual screening (VS) of AD drugs are discussed and evaluated.
