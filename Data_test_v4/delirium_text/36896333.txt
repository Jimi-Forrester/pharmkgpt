36896333|a|The diagnostic criteria for Alzheimer's disease (AD) described in DSM-5-TR, require a decline in memory and learning and in at least one other cognitive domain among six cognitive domains, and also interference with the activities of daily living (ADL) because of decline in these cognitive functions; as such, DSM-5-TR positions memory impairment as the core symptom of AD. DSM-5-TR shows the following examples of symptoms or observations regarding impairments in everyday activities in terms of learning and memory involving the six cognitive domains. Mild: Has difficulty recalling recent events, and relies increasingly on list making or calendar. Major: Repeats self in conversation, often within the same conversation. These examples of symptoms/observations demonstrate difficulties in recall, or difficulties in bringing memories into the consciousness. In the article, it is proposed that considering AD as a disorder of consciousness could promote a better understanding of the symptoms experienced by AD patients and contribute to devising methods to provide improved care to these patients.
