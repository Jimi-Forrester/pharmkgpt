33059089|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases, and it is characterised by progressive deterioration in cognitive and memory abilities, which can severely influence the elderly population's daily living abilities. Although researchers have made great efforts in the field of AD, there are still no well-established strategies to prevent and treat this disease. Therefore, better clarification of the molecular mechanisms associated with the onset and progression of AD is critical to provide a theoretical basis for the establishment of novel preventive and therapeutic strategies. Currently, it is generally believed that neuroinflammation plays a key role in the pathogenesis of AD. Inflammasome, a multiprotein complex, is involved in the innate immune system, and it can mediate inflammatory responses and pyroptosis, which lead to neurodegeneration. Among the various types of inflammasomes, the NLRP3 inflammasome is the most characterised in neurodegenerative diseases, especially in AD. The activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome causes the generation of caspase-1-mediated interleukin (IL)-1beta and IL-18 in microglia cells, where neuroinflammation is involved in the development and progression of AD. Thus, the NLRP3 inflammasome is likely to be a crucial therapeutic molecular target for AD via regulating neuroinflammation. In this review, we summarise the current knowledge on the role and regulatory mechanisms of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the pathogenic mechanisms of AD. We also focus on a series of potential therapeutic treatments targeting NLRP3 inflammasome for AD. Further clarification of the regulatory mechanisms of the NLRP3 inflammasome in AD may provide more useful clues to develop novel AD treatment strategies.
