1388449|a|We determined the oxidative phenotype and metabolic ratio of debrisoquine in 96 Chinese patients with Alzheimer's disease (n = 12), Parkinson's disease (n = 55), and using patients with stroke and cervical spondylosis as controls (n = 29). We did not find any difference in debrisoquine metabolic phenotype among Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and control patients as judged by chi-square analysis. In addition, the metabolic ratio of all our patients was less than 12.6. The result suggested that Chinese patients with Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease metabolize debrisoquine at a velocity not different from that of their Western counterparts even though the frequency distribution of debrisoquine metabolism phenotyping in these two populations is quite different.
