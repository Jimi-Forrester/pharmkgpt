37106622|t|Uncovering the Correlation between COVID-19 and Neurodegenerative Processes: Toward a New Approach Based on EEG Entropic Analysis.
37106622|a|COVID-19 is an ongoing global pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus. Although it primarily attacks the respiratory tract, inflammation can also affect the central nervous system (CNS), leading to chemo-sensory deficits such as anosmia and serious cognitive problems. Recent studies have shown a connection between COVID-19 and neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD). In fact, AD appears to exhibit neurological mechanisms of protein interactions similar to those that occur during COVID-19. Starting from these considerations, this perspective paper outlines a new approach based on the analysis of the complexity of brain signals to identify and quantify common features between COVID-19 and neurodegenerative disorders. Considering the relation between olfactory deficits, AD, and COVID-19, we present an experimental design involving olfactory tasks using multiscale fuzzy entropy (MFE) for electroencephalographic (EEG) signal analysis. Additionally, we present the open challenges and future perspectives. More specifically, the challenges are related to the lack of clinical standards regarding EEG signal entropy and public data that can be exploited in the experimental phase. Furthermore, the integration of EEG analysis with machine learning still requires further investigation.
