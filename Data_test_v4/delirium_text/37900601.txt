37900601|t|Brain MRI findings in severe COVID-19 patients: a meta-analysis.
37900601|a|Introduction: Neurocognitive symptoms and dysfunction of various severities have become increasingly recognized as potential consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although there are numerous observational and subjective survey-reporting studies of neurological symptoms, by contrast, those studies describing imaging abnormalities are fewer in number. Methods: This study conducted a metanalysis of 32 studies to determine the incidence of the common neurological abnormalities using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with COVID-19. Results: We also present the common clinical findings associated with MRI abnormalities. We report the incidence of any MRI abnormality to be 55% in COVID-19 patients with perfusion abnormalities (53%) and SWI abnormalities (44%) being the most commonly reported injuries. Cognitive impairment, ICU admission and/or mechanical ventilation status, older age, and hospitalization or longer length of hospital stay were the most common clinical findings associated with brain injury in COVID-19 patients. Discussion: Overall, the presentation of brain injury in this study was diverse with no substantial pattern of injury emerging, yet most injuries appear to be of vascular origin. Moreover, analysis of the association between MRI abnormalities and clinical findings suggests that there are likely many mechanisms, both direct and indirect, by which brain injury occurs in COVID-19 patients.
