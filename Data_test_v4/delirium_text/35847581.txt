35847581|t|Prohibitins: A Key Link between Mitochondria and Nervous System Diseases.
35847581|a|Prohibitins (PHBs) are conserved proteins in eukaryotic cells, which are mainly located in the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM), cell nucleus, and cell membrane. PHBs play crucial roles in various cellular functions, including the cell cycle regulation, tumor suppression, immunoglobulin M receptor binding, and aging. In addition, recent in vitro and in vivo studies have revealed that PHBs are important in nervous system diseases. PHBs can prevent apoptosis, inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and autophagy in neurological disorders through different molecules and pathways, such as OPA-1, PINK1/Parkin, IL6/STAT3, Tau, NO, LC3, and TDP43. Therefore, PHBs show great promise in the protection of neurological disorders. This review summarizes the relevant studies on the relationship between PHBs and neurological disorders and provides an update on the molecular mechanisms of PHBs in nervous system diseases.
