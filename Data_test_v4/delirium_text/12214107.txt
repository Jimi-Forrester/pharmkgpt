12214107|t|Brain Iron and Zinc Contents of German Patients with Alzheimer Disease.
12214107|a|Our first project aimed to determine the average values of Fe and Zn in normal German human brain (5 individuals, 10 brain parts). Determinations were carried out by instrumental neutron activation analysis in Berlin. Quality control measurements were performed using National Institute of Standard Technology standard reference materials. The present results show non-homogeneous distribution of Fe and Zn in normal human brain. Our second goal was to study the possible elemental concentration changes in German patients with Alzheimer disease (5 subjects, 10 brain regions). Fe and Zn values are found to be significantly changed in some AD brain regions compared to the controls. Another object of this work was to extend the method for the determination of elemental concentration not only in whole brain samples (high fat content) but - applying two types of solvent extraction - in lipid fraction and in brain tissue without lipid.
