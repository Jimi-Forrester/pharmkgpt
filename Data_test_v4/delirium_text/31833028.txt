31833028|t|A Review on MS-Based Blood Biomarkers for Alzheimer's Disease.
31833028|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of neurodegenerative dementia and there is no cure to date. Biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are already included in the diagnostic work-up of symptomatic patients but markers for preclinical diagnosis and disease progression are not available. Furthermore, blood biomarkers are highly appreciated because they are minimally invasive and more accessible in primary care and in clinical studies. Mass spectrometry (MS) is an established tool for the measurement of various analytes in biological fluids such as blood. Its major strength is the high selectivity which is why it is also preferred as a reference method for immunoassays. MS has been used in several studies in the past for blood biomarker discovery and validation in AD using targeted MS such as multiple/selected reaction monitoring (MRM/SRM) or unbiased approaches (proteomics, metabolomics). In this short review, we give an overview on the status of current MS-based biomarker candidates for AD in blood plasma and serum.Plain Language Summary: Plain language summary available for this article.
