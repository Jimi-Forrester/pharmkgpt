39025434|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive cognitive decline. Yttrium oxide nanoparticles (Y2O3NPs) have recently attracted much attention for their potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. However, the effects of Y2O3NPs in animal models of AD are less studied. This study aimed to investigate the potential therapeutic effects of Y2O3NPs in streptozotocin (STZ)-treated rats, a reliable animal model of AD, with special emphasis on cognitive function, neuroinflammation, and mitochondrial biogenesis in the hippocampus. Male Wistar rats were stereotaxically injected with STZ (3 mg/kg, 3 microl/ventricle). Three weeks after STZ injection, cognitive function was assessed using the Morris water maze, elevated plus maze, and passive avoidance tasks. Intraperitoneal treatment with Y2O3NPs (0.1, 0.3, or 0.5 mg/kg) was started 24 h after the STZ injection and continued for 21 days. The mRNA and protein levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-1beta) and components involved in mitochondrial biogenesis (PGC-1alpha, NRF-1, and TFAM) were measured in the hippocampus. The results indicated that STZ induced cognitive impairment and led to neuroinflammation and mitochondrial biogenesis impairment in the hippocampus of rats. Interestingly, treatment with Y2O3NPs effectively reduced STZ-induced cognitive deficits in a dose-dependent manner, possibly by attenuating neuroinflammation and mitochondrial biogenesis impairment. These findings suggest that Y2O3NPs can be considered as a promising therapeutic agent for treating or ameliorating the neuropathological effects associated with AD.
