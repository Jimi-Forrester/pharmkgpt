34970176|t|Case Report: Severe Side Effects Following Treatment With First Generation Antipsychotics While Cariprazine Leads to Full Recovery.
34970176|a|Schizophrenia is a psychiatric disorder characterized by positive, negative, cognitive and affective symptoms. Patient cooperation with health care professionals, compliance with the treatment regime, and regular use of medications are some of the preconditions that need to be met for a favorable disease course. A negative experience following the use of a first-generation antipsychotic to treat first-episode psychosis can negatively affect a patient's motivation for further medication use. In the clinical case reported here, cariprazine was able to restore one such patient's confidence in therapy and facilitated their cooperation with the physician, thereby ensuring effective control of negative and positive symptoms and good functioning for a period of 1 year. Cariprazine may be a good option for maintenance therapy following first-episode psychosis, especially in situations in which a patient has had a negative first experience associated with antipsychotic medication use.
