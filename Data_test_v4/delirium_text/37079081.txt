37079081|a|Increasing cGMP is a unique therapeutic principle, and drugs inhibiting cGMP-degrading enzymes or stimulating cGMP production are approved for the treatment of various diseases such as erectile dysfunction, coronary artery disease, pulmonary hypertension, chronic heart failure, irritable bowel syndrome, or achondroplasia. In addition, cGMP-increasing therapies are preclinically profiled or in clinical development for quite a broad set of additional indications, e.g., neurodegenerative diseases or different forms of dementias, bone formation disorders, underlining the pivotal role of cGMP signaling pathways. The fundamental understanding of the signaling mediated by nitric oxide-sensitive (soluble) guanylyl cyclase and membrane-associated receptor (particulate) guanylyl cyclase at the molecular and cellular levels, as well as in vivo, especially in disease models, is a key prerequisite to fully exploit treatment opportunities and potential risks that could be associated with an excessive increase in cGMP. Furthermore, human genetic data and the clinical effects of cGMP-increasing drugs allow back-translation into basic research to further learn about signaling and treatment opportunities. The biannual international cGMP conference, launched nearly 20 years ago, brings all these aspects together as an established and important forum for all topics from basic science to clinical research and pivotal clinical trials. This review summarizes the contributions to the "10th cGMP Conference on cGMP Generators, Effectors and Therapeutic Implications," which was held in Augsburg in 2022 but will also provide an overview of recent key achievements and activities in the field of cGMP research.
