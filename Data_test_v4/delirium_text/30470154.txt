Data on psychosocial outcomes-i.e., depressive symptoms, talkativeness, mutuality (for both caregivers and care recipients) and burden (for caregivers)-were collected one week prior to (Time 1) and one week after the intervention (Time 2). Using repeated measures generalized linear models, we examined the differences in the amounts and patterns of the changes in outcomes according to age, gender, and the care-recipients' level of cognitive impairment. RESULTS: Some participants benefited from the CLSA-K program, while others did not. For caregivers, mental health, and marital quality remained stable, while caregiver burden increased among those with spouses who had moderate levels of cognitive impairment. For care-recipients, younger and male participants showed increased talkativeness. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: CLSA-K appears to be promising for specific subgroups of participants in Korea. Multi-component or other approaches may be more beneficial for other couples. Cultural differences as well as social positions may play a role in the acceptability and efficacy of the couple-based intervention.
