32545813|t|Recent Advances in the Production and Applications of Ellagic Acid and Its Derivatives. A Review.
32545813|a|Ellagitannins (ETs), characterized by their diversity and chemical complexity, belong to the class of hydrolysable tannins that, via hydrolysis under acidic or alkaline conditions, can yield ellagic acid (EA). They are mostly found as a part of extractives in angiosperms. As known antioxidants and chelators, EA and EA derivatives are drawing an increasing interest towards extensive technical and biomedical applications. The latter ones include possible antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, hepato- and cardioprotective, chemopreventive, neuroprotective, anti-diabetic, gastroprotective, antihyperlipidemic, and antidepressant-like activities, among others. EA's synthesis and production challenges prompt further research on new methods and alternative sources. Conventional and prospective methods and raw materials for the production of EA and its derivatives are reviewed. Among the potential sources of EA, the residues and industrial streams of the pulp industry have been highlighted and considered as an alluring alternative in terms of commercial exploitation.
