37239833|t|Infantile Neurodegeneration Results from Mutants of 17beta-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase Type 10 Rather Than Abeta-Binding Alcohol Dehydrogenase.
37239833|a|Type 10 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17beta-HSD10), a homo-tetrameric multifunctional protein with 1044 residues encoded by the HSD17B10 gene, is necessary for brain cognitive function. Missense mutations result in infantile neurodegeneration, an inborn error in isoleucine metabolism. A 5-methylcytosine hotspot underlying a 388-T transition leads to the HSD10 (p.R130C) mutant to be responsible for approximately half of all cases suffering with this mitochondrial disease. Fewer females suffer with this disease due to X-inactivation. The binding capability of this dehydrogenase to Abeta-peptide may play a role in Alzheimer's disease, but it appears unrelated to infantile neurodegeneration. Research on this enzyme was complicated by reports of a purported Abeta-peptide-binding alcohol dehydrogenase (ABAD), formerly referred to as endoplasmic-reticulum-associated Abeta-binding protein (ERAB). Reports concerning both ABAD and ERAB in the literature reflect features inconsistent with the known functions of 17beta-HSD10. It is clarified here that ERAB is reportedly a longer subunit of 17beta-HSD10 (262 residues). 17beta-HSD10 exhibits L-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity and is thus also referred to in the literature as short-chain 3-hydorxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase or type II 3-hydorxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase. However, 17beta-HSD10 is not involved in ketone body metabolism, as reported in the literature for ABAD. Reports in the literature referring to ABAD (i.e., 17beta-HSD10) as a generalized alcohol dehydrogenase, relying on data underlying ABAD's activities, were found to be unreproducible. Furthermore, the rediscovery of ABAD/ERAB's mitochondrial localization did not cite any published research on 17beta-HSD10. Clarification of the purported ABAD/ERAB function derived from these reports on ABAD/ERAB may invigorate this research field and encourage new approaches to the understanding and treatment of HSD17B10-gene-related disorders. We establish here that infantile neurodegeneration is caused by mutants of 17beta-HSD10 but not ABAD, and so we conclude that ABAD represents a misnomer employed in high-impact journals.
