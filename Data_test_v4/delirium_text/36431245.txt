36431245|t|SUPeRO: A Multidimensional Approach to Prevent and Manage Oncological Frailty in a Radiation Oncology Unit.
36431245|a|Currently, the management of older cancer patients is directed by a personalized approach and, where possible, a tailor-made treatment. Based on our previous experiences and considering the opportunity of combining a geriatric department and a radiation-oncology department, we have developed a path that follows the patient from the beginning of the treatment, taking into account the complications/late toxicities and the survivors. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of remodeling and restructuring some oncology, radiotherapy, and geriatrics services based on the primary evidence for managing older cancer patients. In 2020, Gemelli ART underwent 60,319 radiation-oncology treatments, admitted 943 patients in the radiation-oncology and supportive care ward, and treated and followed 15,268 patients in clinics. The average length of stay of the admitted patients was reduced from 20.6 days to 13.2 days. In 2021, 1196 patients were assessed for frailty, 847 were admitted for toxicity, and 349 patients were evaluated within the geriatric oncology and supportive care outpatient clinic, and it was found that 59.2% were fit, 31.6% were vulnerable, and 9.2% were frail. This experience has shown a reduction in hospitalizations and the average hospital stay of patients in the case of side effects, a high toxicity to treatments, and the possibility of treating patients with a high level of complexity. This approach should represent the future target of geriatric oncology with the global management of older or complex patients with cancer.
