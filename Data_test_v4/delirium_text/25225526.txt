25225526|a|OBJECTIVES: The trail investigated the effect of small dose sufentanil or fentanyl administrated before the end of surgery in reducing the incidence of emergence agitation after anesthesia with sevoflurane in preschool children undergoing ophthalmology surgery, and the incidence of emergence agitation of sevoflurane anesthesia. METHODS: From September 2011 to January 2012 January, ninety ASA I-II children, aged from 3-7 years, undergoing ophthalmology surgery in West China Hospital, were randomly assigned to three groups to receive intravenous saline, sufentanil 0.1mug/kg or fentanyl 1mug/kg at 20 minutes before the end of the surgery. Children were scored by scoring system for emergence agitation (SSEA), Children's and Infants' Postoperative Pain Scale (CHIPPS) score. RESULTS: The incidence of agitation was 30% in sufentanil group, 36.67% in fentanyl group, and 63.33% in control group. The incidence of sever agitation (SSEA score>=3) was 6.67% in sufentanil group, 23.37% in fentanyl group, and 36.67% in control group. The agitation and pain scores in sufentanil group and fentanyl group were better than those in control group (P<0.05). There was no difference among three groups about time to extubation. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the incidence of emergence agitation after sevoflurane anesthesia in children undergoing ophthalmology surgery is up to 63.33%. The single dose of sufentanil or fentanyl can reduce the emergence agitation in children anesthesized with sevoflurane, with no adverse effects. The effect of sufentanil is better than fentanyl.
