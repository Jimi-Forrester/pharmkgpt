20481424|a|This article describes the process of developing and implementing a scripted unfolding case study about delirium as part of a continuing education program for nursing staff. This innovative instructional strategy allows learners to evaluate a situation as it unfolds, practice assessment and communication skills, and reflect on potential problems and solutions. Using the detection and treatment of delirium as an example, the authors describe a template for developing a low-cost, low-fidelity case simulation that includes identifying the key concepts and competencies; writing behavioral learning objectives; creating the story; and identifying clinical decision-making points for discussion. Positive evaluations by program participants (registered nurses, licensed practical nurses, and nursing assistants) indicate that this methodology encourages interactive learning of key concepts in geriatric nursing among participants with varying years of experience.
