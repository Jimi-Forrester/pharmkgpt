19920931|t|Oxybutynin extended release for the management of overactive bladder: a clinical review.
19920931|a|Overactive bladder (OAB) is a common condition which negatively impacts the quality of life of afflicted patients. This can result in alterations in social interactions at home, in the workplace and in the community, often leading to depression and poor self esteem as well as loss of productivity. Traditional mainstays of treatment include both behavioral therapy and pharmacotherapy. Oxybutynin immediate release (IR) represents the first such medication approved by the FDA specifically for treatment of OAB in 1975. Nevertheless, bothersome side effects in addition to thrice daily dosing often led to treatment cessation which raised the question that patients may actually prefer to live with their OAB symptoms rather than incur side effects or complex dosing schemes. Pharmacological advances ultimately led to development of a long-acting formulation of oxybutynin in the form of oxybutynin extended release (ER) with the hope that this drug would maintain efficacy while decreasing bothersome side effects and improve compliance with the convenience of once daily dosing regimen. This paper will review the major clinical studies involving oxybutynin ER as well as its role in different patient populations and potential concerns with its use.
