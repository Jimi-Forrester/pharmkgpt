35884652|t|Nomogram for Predicting Depression Improvement after Deep Brain Stimulation for Parkinson's Disease.
35884652|a|BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease is a common neurodegenerative disease, with depression being a common non-motor symptom. Bilateral subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation is an effective method for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. Thus, this study aimed to establish a nomogram of the possibility of achieving a better depression improvement rate after subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation in patients with Parkinson's disease. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 103 patients with Parkinson's disease who underwent subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation and were followed up for the improvement of their Hamilton Depression scale scores 1 year postoperatively. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to select factors affecting the improvement rate of depression. A nomogram was then developed to predict the possibility of achieving better depression improvement. Furthermore, the discrimination and fitting performance was evaluated using a calibration diagram, receiver operating characteristics, and decision curve analysis. RESULTS: The mean and median improvement rates of Hamilton Depression scores were 13.1 and 33.3%, respectively. Among the 103 patients, 70.8% had an improved depression, 23.3% had a worsened depression, and 5.8% remained unchanged. Logistic multivariate regression analysis showed that age, preoperative Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire, Hamilton Anxiety, and Hamilton Depression scores were independent factors for the possibility of achieving a better depression improvement rate. Based on these results, a nomogram model was developed. The nomogram had a C-index of 0.78 (95% confidence interval: 0.69-0.87) and an area under the receiver operating characteristics of 0.78 (95% confidence interval: 0.69-0.87). The calibration plot and decision curve analysis further demonstrated goodness-of-fit between the nomogram predictions and actual observations. CONCLUSION: We developed a nomogram to predict the possibility of achieving good depression improvement 1 year after subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation in patients with Parkinson's disease, which showed a certain value in judging the expected depression improvement of these patients.
