35676090|t|Incident Herpes Zoster and Risk of Dementia: A Population-Based Danish Cohort Study.
35676090|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Herpes zoster is caused by reactivation of the neurotrophic varicella-zoster virus. Zoster may contribute to development of dementia through neuroinflammation, cerebral vasculopathy, or direct neural damage, but epidemiological evidence is limited. We used data from linked nationwide Danish registries to conduct a cohort study of the association between zoster and dementia during 1997 to 2017. As secondary aims, we examined if associations were more pronounced for zoster involving cranial nerves (mainly ophthalmic zoster) or the central nervous system and Alzheimer's disease as an outcome. METHODS: We included people aged >=40 years with zoster and a general population comparison cohort matched 5:1 by sex and birth year. We identified zoster and dementia in the registries using prescription records in the community and hospital diagnoses. We used Cox regression to compute confounder-adjusted hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for dementia associated with zoster during 0-1 year and 1-21 years of follow-up. We compared the cumulative incidence of dementia, inverse probability-weighted for confounders. RESULTS: The study included 247,305 people with zoster and 1,235,890 matched general population comparators (median age 64 years; 61% female). The HR of all-cause dementia was 0.98 (95% CI: 0.92-1.04) during the first year and 0.93 (95% CI: 0.90-0.95) thereafter in people with zoster versus matched comparators. Dementia was diagnosed in 9.7% of zoster patients and 10.3% of matched comparators by end of follow-up. We observed no increased long-term risk of dementia in subgroup analyses, except possibly in people with central nervous system infection (HR 1.94; 95% CI: 0.78-4.80). Analyses of Alzheimer's disease as a separate outcome showed similar results. DISCUSSION: Herpes zoster is not associated with increased risk of dementia, and contrary to expectation we found a small decrease in risk. The explanation for this finding is unclear, and systematic errors should be considered. Patients with central nervous system involvement had almost two-fold increased relative risk of dementia. The population attributable fraction of dementia due to this rare complication is estimated at 0.014%. Therefore, universal vaccination against varicella-zoster virus in the elderly is unlikely to reduce dementia risk.
