38022275|a|OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and severity of incidental findings in the maxillofacial complex of orthodontic patients imaged with cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) and assign those findings an appropriate clinical significance. METHODOLOGY: Incidental findings (IF) were identified in 250 CBCT scans of adolescent orthodontic patients (aged 13-18 years) with a large field-of-view and categorized based on their anatomic location and placed into one of six subgroups based on anatomic region: i) sino-nasal, ii) dentoalveolar, iii) nasooropharyngeal airway, iv) temporomandibular joint, v) neck, vi) calcifications, and vi) miscellaneous findings. Additionally, findings were assigned a clinical significance score based on severity on a scale of mild, moderate and severe. Mild IF was defined as an IF that does not require any further investigation or referral. Moderate IF was defined as an IF that has the tendency to become clinically significant and should be observed periodically. IFs that warrant further investigation and/or intervention were designated as severe. RESULTS: The percentage of IFs in sino-nasal and dento-alveolar regions were 44.7% and 19.1% respectively. The percentage of IFs with mild, moderate, and severe clinical significance were 27%, 72%, and 1%, respectively. Out of the IFs involving calcifications, 80.8% were stylohyoid calcifications and <1% were cranial cavity IFs such as petroclinoid calcifications and falx cerebri calcifications. Among the sino-nasal findings, 1.2% were identified as severe. CONCLUSION: The sino-nasal region had the highest frequency of IFs. Understanding the prevalence of incidental findings and its clinical relevance is important for clinicians to allow for appropriate monitoring and timely treatment of patients.
