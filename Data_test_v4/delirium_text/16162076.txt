The purpose of this study was to examine an ongoing intervention that targets the needs of rural dementia caregivers by providing appropriate education, training, and access to services. METHOD: A total of 54 rural and 42 urban caregivers participated in the Savvy Caregiver Program in their local communities, with training of 1 week, 2 week, or 3 week sessions by staff of the Alzheimer's Association, Colorado Chapter. Participants completed multiple surveys and questionnaires both before the training and at a 6 month follow-up phone interview. RESULTS: Positive outcomes of the training were found at 6 month follow up for both the rural and urban group, including reported use of the printed manual and CD-ROM. Caregivers reported structuring meaningful activities for the person with dementia. Improved depression scores were found for the rural group, and overall support group use increased. DISCUSSION: The outcomes suggest that targeting rural communities for caregiver training can result in more use of supportive services, effective caregiving strategies, and improved caregiver wellbeing, even in low density population areas where supportive services are more difficult to access.
