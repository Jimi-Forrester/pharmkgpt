38847653|t|DHCR24 in Tumor Diagnosis and Treatment: A Comprehensive Review.
38847653|a|As an important nutrient in the human body, cholesterol can not only provide structural components for the body's cells, but also can be transformed into a variety of active substances to regulate cell signaling pathways. As an important cholesterol synthase, DHCR24 participates in important regulatory processes in the body. The application of DHCR24 in tumor clinical diagnosis and treatment also attracts much attention. This article reviews the structure and regulatory characteristics of DHCR24, and the research of DHCR24 on tumor progression. We summarize the possible mechanisms of DHCR24 promoting tumor progression through reactive oxygen species (ROS), p53, Ras and PI3K-AKT pathways. Through our review, we hope to provide more research ideas and reference value for the application of DHCR24 in tumor prevention and treatment.
