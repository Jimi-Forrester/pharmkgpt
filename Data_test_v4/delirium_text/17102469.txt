17102469|t|Structural visualization of expert nursing: Development of an assessment and intervention algorithm for delirium following abdominal and thoracic surgeries.
17102469|a|An assessment and intervention algorithm for delirium following abdominal and thoracic surgeries was developed based upon the current knowledge-base. The sources of information included literature and clinical expertise. The assessment and intervention algorithm was structured and visualized so that patient-tailored and risk-stratified prediction/prevention, assessment, and intervention could be carried out. Accumulation of clinical outcome data is necessary in the future validation study to identify the relative weight of risk factors and clinical utility of the algorithm.
