39825060|t|Histone Deacetylation in Alzheimer's Diseases (AD); Hope or Hype.
39825060|a|Histone acetylation is the process by which histone acetyltransferases (HATs) add an acetyl group to the N-terminal lysine residues of histones, resulting in a more open chromatin structure. Histone acetylation tends to increase gene expression more than methylation does. In the central nervous system (CNS), histone acetylation is essential for controlling the expression of genes linked to cognition and learning. Histone deacetylases (HDACs), "writing" enzymes (HATs), and "reading" enzymes with bromodomains that identify and localize to acetylated lysine residues are responsible for maintaining histone acetylation. By giving animals HDAC inhibitors (HDACis), it is possible to intentionally control the ratios of "writer" and "eraser" activity, which will change the acetylation of histones. In addition to making the chromatin more accessible, these histone acetylation alterations re-allocate the targeting of "readers," including the transcriptional co-activators, cAMP response element-binding protein (CBP), and bromodomain-containing protein 4 (Brd4) in the CNS. Conclusive evidence has shown that HDACs slow down the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) by reducing the amount of histone acetylation, decreasing the activity of genes linked to memory, supporting cognitive decline and Amyloid beta (Abeta) protein accumulation, influencing aberrant tau phosphorylation, and promoting the emergence of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). In this review, we have covered the therapeutic targets and functions of HDACs that might be useful in treating AD.
