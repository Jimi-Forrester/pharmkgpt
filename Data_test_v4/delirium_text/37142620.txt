37142620|t|Transcriptomic analysis of glutamate-induced HT22 neurotoxicity as a model for screening anti-Alzheimer's drugs.
37142620|a|Glutamate-induced neurotoxicity in the HT22 mouse hippocampal neuronal cell line has been recognized as a valuable cell model for the study of neurotoxicity associated with neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the relevance of this cell model for AD pathogenesis and preclinical drug screening remains to be more elucidated. While there is increasing use of this cell model in a number of studies, relatively little is known about its underlying molecular signatures in relation to AD. Here, our RNA sequencing study provides the first transcriptomic and network analyses of HT22 cells following glutamate exposure. Several differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and their relationships specific to AD were identified. Additionally, the usefulness of this cell model as a drug screening system was assessed by determining the expression of those AD-associated DEGs in response to two medicinal plant extracts, Acanthus ebracteatus and Streblus asper, that have been previously shown to be protective in this cell model. In summary, the present study reports newly identified AD-specific molecular signatures in glutamate-injured HT22 cells, suggesting that this cell can be a valuable model system for the screening and evaluation of new anti-AD agents, particularly from natural products.
