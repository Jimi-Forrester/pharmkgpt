35272476|a|Aim: The development of biomarker-based diagnostic procedures often relies on samples stored for several years. We aimed to investigate the influence of storage time and patient age on six neuroregulatory and immunoregulatory serum biomarkers. Materials & methods: We quantified six biomarkers in serum from 151 individuals using ELISA. Serum was stored at -80 C for up to 9.5 years. Results: When associating storage time with biomarker values, BDNF, VEGF-A and TGF-beta1 showed a significant increase over time; IGF-1, MCP-1 and IL-18 did not. Associating participant age with biomarkers, only IL-18 in Alzheimer's disease patients showed a significant increase. Conclusion: Storage time can influence results of biomarkers in human serum. This needs to be considered when assessing samples stored for several years.
