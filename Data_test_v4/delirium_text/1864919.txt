1864919|t|Implicit and explicit memory in Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.
1864919|a|Several tasks examined implicit and explicit memory in demographically matched samples of Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, and healthy elderly subjects. A fragmented pictures test, word stem-completion repetition priming, and a pursuit-rotor tracking task, followed by explicit memory tests, were given. AD patients were impaired on all explicit tests and on word stem-completion priming, but were intact on pursuit-rotor tracking and the skill learning (SL) component of the fragmented pictures test. PD patients were significantly better than AD patients on all explicit memory tests, but were selectively impaired on the SL component of the fragmented pictures test. Finally, a mirror-reading test was given to the PD patients and control subjects, with no significant differences found in performances between the two groups. Results are discussed in terms of hypothetical cognitive processes and brain circuits underlying different implicit and explicit memory domains.
