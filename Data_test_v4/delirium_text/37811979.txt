37811979|t|Association of cancer history with structural brain aging markers of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias risk.
37811979|a|INTRODUCTION: Cancer survivors are less likely than comparably aged individuals without a cancer history to develop Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). METHODS: In the UK Biobank, we investigated associations between cancer history and five structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) markers for ADRD risk, using linear mixed-effects models to assess differences in mean values and quantile regression to examine whether associations varied across the distribution of MRI markers. RESULTS: Cancer history was associated with smaller mean hippocampal volume (b = -19 mm3 , 95% CI = -36, -1) and lower mean cortical thickness in the Alzheimer's disease signature region (b = -0.004 mm, 95% CI = -0.007, -0.000). Quantile regressions indicated individuals most vulnerable to ADRD were more affected by cancer history. DISCUSSION: Some brain MRI markers associated with ADRD risk were elevated in adults with a history of cancer. The magnitude of the adverse associations varied across quantiles of neuroimaging markers, and the pattern suggests possible harmful associations for individuals already at high ADRD risk. HIGHLIGHTS: We found no evidence of an inverse association between cancer history and ADRD-related neurodegeneration. Cancer history was associated with smaller mean hippocampal volume and lower mean cortical thickness in the Alzheimer's disease signature region. Quantile regressions indicated individuals most vulnerable to ADRD were more affected by cancer history.
