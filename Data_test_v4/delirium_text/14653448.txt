14653448|a|Plasma membranes are fluid structures and the maintenance of fluidity is a prerequisite for function, viability, growth and reproduction of cells. Membrane fluidity is the reciprocal of membrane microviscosity, which in turn is inversely proportional to rotational and lateral diffusion rates of membrane components. In the absence of constraints most lipids and unrestrained integral proteins freely diffuse in the plane of the membrane with high diffusion coefficients. The fluid mosaic model of plasma membrane structure is essentially still valid but this model is by its nature a macroscopic one. At present, attention is focused on molecular structural details of protein-lipid interactions and on the static and dynamic structure of membrane proteins. Highly potent new macroscopic and microscopic methods have been developed to measure translational diffusion of membrane lipids and proteins. The microscopic methods can reveal diffusion via encounters between labeled molecules. Fluorescence anisotropy measurements are the most widely used techniques in biological research. The use of different permeant and non-permeant fluorophores have contributed much to a better understanding of the changes in the ordered states and motional freedom of the membrane phospholipids in different cells during development, aging and physiological functions as well as in pathological conditions. The application of fluorophores with non-random distribution have shed light on the asymmetrical changes between the outer and inner domain of the lipid bilayer and on the dynamics of 'flip-flop' in signal transduction. Membrane fluidity was shown to have a decisive role in the efficiency of ligand binding, in the outcome of direct cell to cell contacts and in the modulation of the activity of membrane enzymes. Cell filtrability reflects whole cell viscosity that can not always be correlated with the fine changes in membrane fluidity. Cell viscosity depends inter alia on the size and shape of the cells as well as on membrane rigidity. In contrast to this, membrane fluidity is only dependent on the freedom of mobility of the membrane constituents. Increased release of free radicals and reactive oxygen specie (ROS) affect membrane fluidity, cellular Ca2+ homeostasis, induce lipid peroxidation and finally cell death. Investigation of membrane fluidity proved to be a useful and sensitive additional method to obtain a better insight into the mechanisms by which different compounds, drugs and contact with foreign surfaces are affecting cellular functions. The measurements of membrane fluidity may gain more widespread use for monitoring the safety and efficacy of these actions. During the last few years, changes in membrane fluidity of blood cells have been reported during development and aging and as a result of physiological cell functions. Membrane fluidity changes have been described in thrombocythaemia, hyperlipidaemia, hypercholesterolaemia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obesity, septic conditions and in allergic and burnt patients, in alcoholics, in Alzheimer's disease and in schizophrenia. A short summary is given on red cell membrane fluidity changes in a Hungarian triosephosphate isomerase (TPI)-deficient family, reflecting how the very subtle changes in membrane fluidity can help to establish underlying biological differences between the clinical phenotypes of a severe enzyme (TPI) deficiency caused by the defect of a single gene in two brothers one with and one without neurological symptoms.
