35407540|t|Randomized Controlled Trial Comparing a Multidisciplinary Intervention by a Geriatrician and a Cardiologist to Usual Care after a Heart Failure Hospitalization in Older Patients: The SENECOR Study.
35407540|a|BACKGROUND: The prognosis of older patients after a heart failure (HF) hospitalization is poor. METHODS: In this randomized trial, we consecutively assigned 150 patients 75 years old or older with a recent heart failure hospitalization to follow-up by a cardiologist (control) or follow-up by a cardiologist and a geriatrician (intervention). The primary outcome was all-cause hospitalization at a one-year follow-up. RESULTS: All-cause hospitalization occurred in 47 of 75 patients (62.7%) in the intervention group and in 58 of 75 patients (77.3%) in the control group (hazard ratio, 0.67; 95% confidence interval, 0.46 to 0.99; p = 0.046). The number of patients with at least one HF hospitalization was similar in both groups (34.7% in the intervention group vs. 40% in the control group, p = 0.5). There were a total of 236 hospitalizations during the study period. The main reasons for hospitalization were heart failure (38.1%) and infection (14.8%). Mortality was 24.7%. Heart failure was the leading cause of mortality (54.1% of all deaths), without differences between groups. CONCLUSIONS: A follow-up by a cardiologist and geriatrician in older patients after an HF hospitalization was superior to a cardiologist's follow-up in reducing all-cause hospitalization in older patients.
