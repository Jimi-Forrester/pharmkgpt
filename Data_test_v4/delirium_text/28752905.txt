28752905|a|AIMS: Postoperative delirium (POD) and declined cognitive function were common in patients (especially elderly patients) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), which may affect quality of life (QoL). The aim of this study was to determine the relationships among age, POD, declined cognitive function, and QoL in patients who underwent CABG. METHODS: Consecutive patients who underwent first time elective CABG and assessed for POD using Confusion Assessment Method for intensive care unit for 5 postoperative days from November 2013 to March 2015 were recruited. A cross-sectional study was conducted during April 2015 to assess their cognitive function and QoL, using the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status Scale and Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form Health Survey. The relationships among age, POD, declined cognitive function, and QoL were tested using path analysis. RESULTS: Declined cognitive function was associated with poorer QoL. POD was associated with declined cognitive function but was not associated with poorer QoL. Ageing was not associated with QoL but was associated with POD and declined cognitive function. CONCLUSION: The QoL of patients developed delirium after CABG is determined by cognitive function after discharge. Necessary strategies should be implemented to prevent POD and declined cognitive function, especially in elderly patients.
