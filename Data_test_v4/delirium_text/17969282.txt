17969282|a|The case of a 52-year-old white female patient with personal and family history of psychiatric disorders and pubic pediculosis that was referred for presenting exulcerated lesions of the skin during the last two years was reported. On the microscopic study, the samples taken from the patient during her admission corresponded to epithelium and hair. The skin biopsy was interpreted as exulceration secondary to scratching, and no evidence of parasites was found. Psychological and psychiatric evaluation of the patient confirmed her hallucinatory state. She was finally diagnosed a Delusional Parasitosis (II grade Primary Dermatozoal Parasitic Delirium, ectoparasitosis). This is a very infrequent diagnosis and no documented case was found of this dermatological pathology in Cuba.
