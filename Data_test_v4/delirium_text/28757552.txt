28757552|a|In our study, we attempted to investigate the influences of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) on DL0410, a novel synthetic molecule for Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatment, for intestinal absorption and blood-brain barrier permeability in vitro and related binding mechanisms in silico. Caco-2, MDCK, and MDCK-MDR1 cells were utilized for transport studies, and homology modelling of human P-gp was built for further docking study to uncover the binding mode of DL0410. The results showed that the apparent permeability (Papp) value of DL0410 was approximately 1 x 10-6 cm/s, indicating the low permeability of DL0410. With the presence of verapamil, the directional transport of DL0410 disappeared in Caco-2 and MDCK-MDR1 cells, suggesting that DL0410 should be a substrate of P-gp, which was also confirmed by P-gp ATPase assay. In addition, DL0410 could competitively inhibit the transport of Rho123, a P-gp known substrate. According to molecular docking, we also found that DL0410 could bind to the drug binding pocket (DBP), but not the nucleotide binding domain (NBD). In conclusion, DL0410 was a substrate as well as a competitive inhibitor of P-gp, and P-gp had a remarkable impact on the intestine and brain permeability of DL0410, which is of significance for drug research and development.
