35493808|a|Objective: To determine differences in long-term health and neurological outcomes following infantile spasms (IS) in patients treated with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) vs. prednisolone/prednisone (PRED). Methods: A retrospective, case-control study of patients with an International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modifications (ICD-9) diagnosis of IS, identified over a 10-year period from a national administrative database, was conducted. IS patients treated with ACTH or PRED were determined and cohorts established by propensity score matching. Outcomes, defined by hospital discharge ICD codes, were followed for each patient for 5 years. Related ICD codes were analyzed jointly as phenotype codes (phecodes). Analysis of phecodes between cohorts was performed including phenome-wide association analysis. Results: A total of 5,955 IS patients were identified, and analyses were subsequently performed for 493 propensity score matched patients, each in the ACTH and PRED cohorts. Following Bonferroni correction, no phecode was more common in either cohort (p < 0.001). However, assuming an a priori difference, one phecode, abnormal findings on study of brain or nervous system (a category of abnormal neurodiagnostic tests), was more common in the PRED cohort (p <0.05), and was robust to sensitivity analysis. Variability in outcomes was noted between hospitals. Significance: We found that long-term outcomes for IS patients following ACTH or PRED treatment were very similar, including for both neurological and non-neurological outcomes. In the PRED-treated cohort there was a higher incidence of abnormal neurodiagnostic tests, assuming an a priori statistical model. Future studies can evaluate whether variability in outcomes between hospitals may be affected by post-treatment differences in care models.
