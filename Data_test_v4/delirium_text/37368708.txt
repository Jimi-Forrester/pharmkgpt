37368708|a|Neuroinflammation is critical in developing and progressing neurological diseases. The underlying pro-inflammatory cytokine expression combined with additional mechanisms in the neuropathology, such as oxidative stress, brain-blood barrier damage, and endothelial dysfunction, could contribute to the susceptibility to developing severe COVID-19. The physiopathology of SARS-CoV-2 and other human coronaviruses (H-CoVs) has not been completely understood; however, they have all been linked to a disproportionated response of the immune system, particularly an exacerbated cytokine production and the dysregulation of total cell counts. In this article, based on the compilation of studies reported by our working group regarding COVID-19 and neurological diseases, we propose that the inflammation observed in the central nervous system, through a CSF analysis, could be conditioned by neurological disease(s) and enhanced by COVID-19. Therefore, it is necessary to determine the cytokine profile in different neurological disorders to propose adequate treatments and avoid severe forms of the disease in these patients.
