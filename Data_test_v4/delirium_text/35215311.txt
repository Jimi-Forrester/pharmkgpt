35215311|t|Dementia and COVID-19: A Case Report and Literature Review on Pain Management.
35215311|a|The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic imposes an unprecedented lifestyle, dominated by social isolation. In this frame, the population to pay the highest price is represented by demented patients. This group faces the highest risk of mortality, in case of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection, and they experience rapid cognitive deterioration, due to lockdown measures that prevent their disease monitoring. This complex landscape mirrors an enhancement of neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPSs), with agitation, delirium and reduced motor performances, particularly in non-communicative patients. Due to the consistent link between agitation and pain in these patients, the use of antipsychotics, increasing the risk of death during COVID-19, can be avoided or reduced through an adequate pain treatment. The most suitable pain assessment scale, also feasible for e-health implementation, is the Mobilization-Observation-Behaviour-Intensity-Dementia (MOBID-2) pain scale, currently under validation in the Italian real-world context. Here, we report the case of an 85-year-old woman suffering from mild cognitive impairment, subjected to off-label treatment with atypical antipsychotics, in the context of undertreated pain, who died during the pandemic from an extensive brain hemorrhage. This underscores the need for appropriate assessment and treatment of pain in demented patients.
