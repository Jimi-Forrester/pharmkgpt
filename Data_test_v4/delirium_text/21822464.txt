21822464|t|Determination of the Pharmacokinetics and Oral Bioavailability of Salicylamine, a Potent gamma-Ketoaldehyde Scavenger, by LC/MS/MS.
21822464|a|Levels of reactive gamma-ketoaldehydes derived from arachidonate increase in diseases associated with inflammation and oxidative injury. To assess the biological importance of these gamma-ketoaldehydes, we previously identified salicylamine as an effective gamma-ketoaldehyde scavenger in vitro and in cells. To determine if salicylamine could be administered in vivo, we developed an LC/MS/MS assay to measure salicylamine in plasma and tissues. In mice, half-life (t(1/2)) was 62 minutes. Drinking water supplementation (1-10 g/L) generated tissue concentrations (10-500 muM) within the range previously shown to inhibit gamma-ketoaldehydes in cells. Therefore, oral administration of salicylamine can be used to assess the contribution of gamma-ketoaldehydes in animal models of disease.
