39763099|t|User Experience of a Semi-Immersive Musical Serious Game to Stimulate Cognitive Functions in Hospitalized Older Patients: Questionnaire Study.
39763099|a|Background: Reminiscence therapy through music is a psychosocial intervention with benefits for older patients with neurocognitive disorders. Therapies using virtual or augmented reality are efficient in ecologically assessing, and eventually training, episodic memory in older populations. We designed a semi-immersive musical game called "A Life in Songs," which invites patients to immerse themselves in a past era through visuals and songs from that time period. The game aspires to become a playful, easy-to-use, and complete tool for the assessment, rehabilitation, and prevention of neurocognitive decline associated with aging. Objective: This study aimed to assess the user experience (UX) associated with the newly designed serious game. Methods: After one or several sessions of the game guided by the therapist, patients of the geriatric wards were asked to answer questions selected from 2 widely known UX scales (AttrakDiff and meCUE [modular evaluation of the components of user experience]) with the therapist's help. The internal consistency of the UX dimensions was assessed through Cronbach alpha to verify the validity of the dimensions. The level of engagement of the patient throughout the experimental session was also assessed following an internally developed scale, which included 5 levels (interactive, constructive, active, passive, and disengaged behaviors). UX mean scores were computed and presented graphically. Verbal feedbacks were reported to support the quantitative results. Results: Overall, 60 inpatients with a mean age of 84.2 (SD 5.5) years, the majority of whom were women (41/60, 68%), were included. Their score on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) ranged between 12 and 29. A majority of patients (27/56, 48%) had no major neurocognitive disorder (MNCD), 22/56 (39%) had mild MNCD, and 7/56 (13%) had moderate MNCD. The results revealed very positive UX with mean values beyond the neutral values for every UX dimension of both scales. The overall mean (SD) judgment was rated 3.92 (SD 0.87) (on a scale of -5 to 5). Internal consistency was acceptable to good for the emotional dimensions of the meCUE. Questionable to unacceptable consistency was found for the other UX dimensions. Participants were mostly active (23/60, 38%) and constructive (21/60, 35%). Conclusions: These findings demonstrated a very good appreciation of the game by geriatric inpatients. Participants' and health care professionals' verbal comments strongly aligned with the quantitative results. The poor internal consistency in the UX dimensions reflected the high heterogeneity among the included patients. Further studies are needed to evaluate the potential benefits of clinical factors such as neurocognitive functions, mood, depression, or quality of life.
