39177350|a|OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of cluster nursing care based on 10S continuous quality improvement (CQI) on the incidence of postoperative delirium in patients with BPH. METHODS: This study included 96 BPH patients undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) in our department from August 2021 to February 2023. We randomly divided the patients into two groups of equal number to receive routine postoperative nursing care (the control group) and postoperative cluster nursing care based on the 10S DQI mode (the observation group), respectively. We recorded and compared the delirium scores of the patients at 2, 6, 12 and 24 hours after operation, their status of recovery, scores on Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) and quality of life (QOL), and incidence of complications between the two groups. RESULTS: Compared with the controls, the patients in the observation group showed significantly lower delirium scores at 2 h (12.72+-3.54 vs 10.65+-2.87, P<0.05), 6 h (20.17+-4.92 vs 14.19+-4.64, P<0.01), 12 h (16.82+-4.24 vs 10.69+-3.18, P<0.01) and 24 h (13.61+-2.86 vs 9.13+-2.12, P<0.01) after operation, and shorter time to ambulation ([3.65+-1.41] vs [2.84+-0.83] d, P<0.01) and time of postoperative catheterization ([6.28+-1.65] vs [4.28+-1.14] d, P<0.01), bladder irrigation ([3.41+-1.08] vs [2.25+-0.71] d, P<0.01) and hospitalization ([10.33+-2.41] vs [7.82+-2.06] d, P<0.01). No statistically significant differences were observed between the two groups in either the SAS and SDS scores (P >0.05) or the QOL scores before operation (P >0.05), but the former two were dramatically decreased (P<0.01) while the latter one increased in the observation group postoperatively (P<0.01). Postoperative complications included delirium, bladder spasm, urethral pain, and secondary bleeding, with a significantly lower total incidence rate in the observation than in the control group (12.50% vs 52.08%, P<0.01). CONCLUSION: Cluster nursing care based on 10S CQI can promote the postoperative recovery of BPH patients, improve their psychological status and quality of life, and reduce the incidence of delirium and complications.
