18166609|a|To supervise activities for patients with frontotemporal dementias presents major challenges to day programs typically equipped to care for more elderly, frail patients. In this article, we present the development and immediate outcomes of integrating a day program specialized for patients with frontal lobe disturbances into an already established day program. Planning required new collaborations between the ambulatory memory clinic and the day program staff. Immediate outcomes have included relief of burden for an under-served group of caregivers and behavioral management that more seamlessly combines strategies for medication titration, environmental adjustments, and activity participation.
