39812538|t|Targeting Astrogliosis in the Retrotrapezoid Nucleus: A Novel Approach to Ameliorate Respiratory Dysfunction and Alzheimer's Pathology in Mice.
39812538|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD), a leading cause of dementia, is associated with significant respiratory dysfunctions. Our study explores the role of astrogliosis in the brainstem retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN), a key breathing regulatory center, and its impact on breathing control and AD pathology in mice. Using Tg-2576 AD and wild-type mice, we investigated the effect of silencing the transforming growth factor-beta receptor II (TGFbetaR II) in the RTN. We performed behavioral tests, including the Barnes maze and novel object recognition test, along with whole-body plethysmography to assess breathing disorders. Our results showed that AD mice exhibited increased apneas and cognitive impairment, which were significantly mitigated following TGFbetaR II gene silencing. Immunohistochemistry revealed elevated levels of GFAP and TGFbetaR II in the RTN of AD mice, which were reduced post-gene silencing, alongside a decrease in amyloid-beta expression in the cortex and hippocampus. These findings suggest that targeting astrogliosis and improving respiratory control may offer a novel therapeutic avenue for managing Alzheimer's disease. Our study provides the first mechanistic insights into how TGFbeta signaling influences both respiratory control and AD pathogenesis, highlighting the potential benefits of stabilizing breathing patterns in AD treatment.
