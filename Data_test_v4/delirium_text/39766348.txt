39766348|t|Identifying Hub Genes and miRNAs Associated with Alzheimer's Disease: A Bioinformatics Pathway to Novel Therapeutic Strategies.
39766348|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that mainly affects the elderly population. It is characterized by cognitive impairment and dementia due to abnormal levels of amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) and axonal Tau protein in the brain. However, the complex underlying mechanisms affecting this disease are not yet known, and there is a lack of standardized biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Therefore, in this study, by means of bioinformatics analysis, AD-affected brain tissue was analyzed using the GSE138260 dataset, identifying 612 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Functional analysis revealed 388 upregulated DEGs associated with sensory perception and 224 downregulated DEGs linked to the regulation and modulation of synaptic processes. Protein-protein interaction network analysis identified 20 hub genes. Furthermore, miRNA target gene networks revealed 1767 miRNAs linked to hub genes, among which hsa-mir-106a-5p, hsa-mir-17-5p, hsa-mir-26a-5p, hsa-mir-27a-3p and hsa-mir-34a-5p were the most relevant. This study presents novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets for AD by analyzing the information obtained with a comprehensive literature review, providing new potential targets to study their role in AD.
