6141615|t|Lack of cholinergic deficit in the neocortex in Pick's disease.
6141615|a|Choline acetyltransferase activity was decreased in the frontal cortex in Alzheimer's and Gerstmann-Straussler dementias but not in Pick's disease. Cortical somatostatin was only decreased in Alzheimer's dementia. Postsynaptic muscarinic binding sites appeared to be decreased in a subpopulation of Alzheimer's patients. Our data indicate that a loss of cholinergic innervation of the cortex is not common to all dementias.
