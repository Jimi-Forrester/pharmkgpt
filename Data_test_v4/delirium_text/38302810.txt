38302810|a|Dementia is the term used to describe a group of cognitive disorders characterized by a decline in memory, thinking, and reasoning abilities that interfere with daily life activities. Examples of dementia include Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Frontotemporal dementia (FTD), Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Vascular dementia (VaD) and Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). AD is the most common form of dementia. The hallmark pathology of AD includes formation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) oligomers and tau hyperphosphorylation in the brain, which induces neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, synaptic dysfunction, and neuronal apoptosis. Emerging studies have associated long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) with the pathogenesis and progression of the neurodegenerative diseases. LncRNAs are defined as RNAs longer than 200 nucleotides that lack the ability to encode functional proteins. LncRNAs play crucial roles in numerous biological functions for their ability to interact with different molecules, such as proteins and microRNAs, and subsequently regulate the expression of their target genes at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. In this narrative review, we report the function and mechanisms of action of lncRNAs found to be deregulated in different types of dementia, with the focus on AD. Finally, we discuss the emerging role of lncRNAs as biomarkers of dementias.
