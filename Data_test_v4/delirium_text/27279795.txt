27279795|t|The Association of -429T>C and -374T>A Polymorphisms in the RAGE Gene with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome.
27279795|a|Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a complex disorder characterized by hyperandrogenism and insulin resistance. In addition, a number of females with PCOS have ovaries with multiple cysts, an irregular or no menstrual cycle, and an imbalance of female hormones compared to those of normal controls. A variety of genetic factors have been involved in the pathogenesis of PCOS. Among these genetic factors, the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) that is associated with diabetes and involved in the complications of PCOS, was selected. We aimed to assess the relationship between -429T>C and -374T>A single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of RAGE gene with the susceptibility to PCOS.128 controls and 265 PCOS patients were used for -374T>A polymorphism and 141 controls and 290 PCOS patients were used for -429T>C polymorphism, respectively. Genotyping of two polymorphisms were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) assay and statistical analysis was performed. P values for both alleles were higher than 0.05. Frequencies of genotype and allele of two polymorphisms in RAGE gene showed no significant differences between controls and PCOS patients. The initial study on the correlation between RAGE gene and PCOS indicates that the two polymorphisms of RAGE are not associated with the pathogenesis of PCOS. However, further studies regarding the association between RAGE gene and PCOS patients in different ethnic groups are required.
