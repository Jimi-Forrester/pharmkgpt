38520278|t|Incidence and Risk Factors for ICU-Associated Delirium in the Alert Geriatric Trauma Population.
38520278|a|BACKGROUND: This study analyzed the overall incidence of delirium, comorbid conditions, injury patterns, and pharmacological risk factors for the development of delirium in an alert, geriatric trauma population. METHODS: IRB-approved, prospective, consecutive cohort series at two Southeastern Level 1 trauma centers from June 11 to August 15, 2023. Delirium was assessed using the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) score. Comorbidities and medications were detailed from electronic medical records. Inclusion criteria: age >=55, GCS >=14, and ICU admission for trauma. Patients on a ventilator were excluded. Data was analyzed using SPSS version 28 (Armonk, NY: IBM Corp). RESULTS: In total, 196 patients met inclusion criteria. Incidences of delirium for Hospital 1 (n = 103) and Hospital 2 (n = 93) were 15.5% and 12.9%, respectively, with an overall incidence of 14.3% and with no statistical differences between hospitals (P = .599). CAD, CKD, dementia, stroke history, and depression were statistically significant risk factors for developing delirium during ICU admission. Inpatient SSRI/SNRIs, epinephrine/norepinephrine, and lorazepam were significant risk factors. Injury patterns, operative intervention, and use of lidocaine infusions and gabapentin were not statistically significant in delirium development. Using binary linear regression (BLR) analysis, independent risk factors for delirium were dementia, any stage CKD, home SSRI/SRNI prescription, any spine injury and cerebrovascular disease, or injury. DISCUSSION: Comorbidities of CAD, CHF, CKD, and depression, and these medications: home lorazepam and ICU epinephrine/norepinephrine statistically are more common in patients developing delirium. Dementia, CKD, home SSRI/SRNI and stroke/cerebrovascular disease/injury, and spine injuries are independent predictors by BLR.
