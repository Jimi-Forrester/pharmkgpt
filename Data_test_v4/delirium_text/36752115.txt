36752115|t|The Role of Ketogenic Diet in the Treatment of Neuroblastoma.
36752115|a|The ketogenic diet (KD) was initially used in 1920 for drug-resistant epileptic patients. From this point onward, ketogenic diets became a pivotal part of nutritional therapy research. To date, KD has shown therapeutic potential in many pathologies such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, autism, brain cancers, and multiple sclerosis. Although KD is now an adjuvant therapy for certain diseases, its effectiveness as an antitumor nutritional therapy is still an ongoing debate, especially in Neuroblastoma. Neuroblastoma is the most common extra-cranial solid tumor in children and is metastatic at initial presentation in more than half of the cases. Although Neuroblastoma can be managed by surgery, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and radiotherapy, its 5-year survival rate in children remains below 40%. Earlier studies have proposed the ketogenic diet as a possible adjuvant therapy for patients undergoing treatment for Neuroblastoma. In this study, we seek to review the possible roles of KD in the treatment of Neuroblastoma.
