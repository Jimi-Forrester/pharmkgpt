33879752|a|RATIONALE: Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome (GSS) is a rare autosomal dominant disease caused by a mutation in the prion protein gene (PRNP) that is not well known among neurologists and is therefore easily misdiagnosed. PATIENT CONCERNS: : A 49-year-old man was admitted for the first time because of an unsteady walk with mogilalia for 1 year. He underwent a cervical discectomy and a plate-screw fixation 6 months prior, although postoperative gait instability did not improve. DIAGNOSIS: Whole exome sequencing identified a pathogenic and heterozygous mutation in the PRNP 4 years after onset. The patient was eventually diagnosed with GSS. INTERVENTIONS: Symptomatic treatment to improve cerebrocirculation and cerebrometabolism was provided. OUTCOMES: The neurological decline continued. The Mini-Mental State Examination and modified Rankin Scale scores changed from 19 to 11 and 2 to 5, respectively. Progressive cerebral and cerebellar atrophy on magnetic resonance imaging was observed. LESSONS: Cerebral and cerebellar atrophy are neuroimaging features symptomatic of GSS that become more apparent as the disease progresses. This atrophy is positively correlated with the severity of symptoms and reduced quality of life. Neurologists treating middle-aged patients with progressive ataxia, cognitive impairment or dysarthria, and brain atrophy need to consider the possibility of GSS.
