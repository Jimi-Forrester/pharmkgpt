38247905|a|Salivary gland dysfunction affects millions globally, and tissue engineering may provide a promising therapeutic avenue. This review delves into the current state of salivary gland tissue engineering research, starting with a study of normal salivary gland development and function. It discusses the impact of fibrosis and cellular senescence on salivary gland pathologies. A diverse range of cells suitable for tissue engineering including cell lines, primary salivary gland cells, and stem cells are examined. Moreover, the paper explores various supportive biomaterials and scaffold fabrication methodologies that enhance salivary gland cell survival, differentiation, and engraftment. Innovative engineering strategies for the improvement of vascularization, innervation, and engraftment of engineered salivary gland tissue, including bioprinting, microfluidic hydrogels, mesh electronics, and nanoparticles, are also evaluated. This review underscores the promising potential of this research field for the treatment of salivary gland dysfunction and suggests directions for future exploration.
