29109409|t|Candidate proteins from predegenerated nerve exert time-specific protection of retinal ganglion cells in glaucoma.
29109409|a|Glaucoma is thought to be the main cause of severe visual impairment or permanent loss of vision. Current therapeutic strategies are not sufficient to protect against glaucoma. Thus, new therapies and potential novel therapeutic targets must be developed to achieve progress in the treatment of this insidious disease. This study was undertaken to verify whether the time of administration of an extract from predegenerated rat sciatic nerves as well as exposure time of this extract onto retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) influences the survival of RGCs in a rat glaucoma model. We have demonstrated that extract obtained from the predegenerated sciatic nerves protects RGCs in a rat glaucoma model. The neuroprotective effect depends mostly on the time of administration of the extract and less clearly on the time of exposure to the extract and is associated with stimulation of endogenous BDNF expression both in RGCs and glial cells. The 14th day following glaucoma induction represents a therapeutic window for effective treatment in a glaucoma model. Mass Spectrometry analysis demonstrated that metallothionein 2 (MT2) may be a key molecule responsible for neuroprotective effects on RGC survival.
