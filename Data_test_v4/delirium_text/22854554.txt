22854554|a|PURPOSE: The aims of this study were to develop and test the validity of the Korean Nursing Delirium Scale (Nu-DESC) for older patients in hospital. METHODS: The Korean Nu-DESC was developed based on the Nu-DESC (Gaudreau, 2005), and revised according to nursing records related to signs and symptoms of older patients with delirium (n=361) and the results of a pilot study (n=42) in one general hospital. To test the validity of the Korean Nu-DESC, 75 older patients whom nurses suspected of delirium from 731 older patients from 12 nursing units were assessed by bedside nurses using the Korean Nu-DESC. A Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve of the Korean Nu-DESC was constructed with an accompanying Area Under the Curve (AUC). RESULTS: Specific examples such as irritable, kidding, sleeping tendency, which were observed by bedside nurses in Korea, were identified in the five features of signs and symptoms of delirium in the instrument. The Korean Nu-DESC was psycho-metrically valid and had a sensitivity and specificity of .81-.76 and .97-.73, respectively. The AUC were .89, .74. CONCLUSION: Results of this study indicate that the Korean Nu-DESC is well-suited for widespread clinical use in busy inpatients settings and shows promise as a research instrument.
