36938390|t|HPLC analysis, mycochemical contents and biological activities of two edible hypogeous ascomycetes: Tirmania nivea and Terfezia boudieri.
36938390|a|Truffle, the hypogeous, ascomycetous macrofungus, has been recognized as a delicacy for centuries, and it is gaining elevated status in the culinary domain. The chemical composition and biological activities of aqueous extract and ground material of two desert Tunisian Tirmania nivea and Terfezia boudieri were studied for the first time. Using three assays antioxidant activity of the aqueous extract and ground material of the two truffles were investigated. Indeed, the aqueous extract and ground material of Terfezia boudieri showed the highest capacity for the DPPH scavenging test (IC50 = 0.18 mg/mL) and with regard to the chelating power of iron (IC50 = 0.22 mg/mL). At the same time, the highest capacity for iron reduction was recorded in the crude material of Tirmania nivea. Besides, the total phenolic, flavonoid, flavanol, tannin, and proanthocyanidin contents of both truffles extracts were determined. The ground material showed the best antibacterial activity for two ascomycetes against seven strains of bacteria. HPLC analysis of aqueous extracts showed that the predominant phenolic compounds in T. boudieri and T. nivea were gallic acid (33.25%) and myricetin (52.91%). Therefore, these truffles are a source of natural antioxidant and antimicrobial agents and could be used as a potential health food.
