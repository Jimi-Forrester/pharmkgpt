10981632|t|Misfolding of membrane proteins in health and disease: the lady or the tiger?
10981632|a|Protein misfolding is increasingly recognized as a factor in many diseases, including cystic fibrosis, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's and atherosclerosis. Many proteins involved in misfolding-based pathologies are membrane-associated, such that the bilayer may play roles in normal and aberrant folding. It can be argued that the in vivo partitioning of eukaryotic membrane proteins between folding and misfolding pathways is under kinetic control. Moreover, the balance between these pathways can be surprisingly delicate.
