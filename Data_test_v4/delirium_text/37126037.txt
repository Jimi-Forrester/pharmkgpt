37126037|a|Cannabidiol (CBD) is one of the major phytocannabinoids present in the cannabis plant, with no acute psychotropic effects and a favorable safety and abuse liability profile. Animal and limited controlled human studies have demonstrated CBD to have analgesic, anxiolytic, anti-inflammatory, antipsychotic, and anticonvulsant effects, to name a few possible indications. There is growing evidence for the use of CBD to treat neurological disorders such as epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. It has been suggested that CBD improves cognition and neurogenesis. Cognitive impairment is associated with numerous disorders and can involve deficits in learning, memory, executive functioning, and attention. The purpose of this review will be to evaluate the available preclinical and clinical data on CBD for the treatment of the cognitive impairment associated with several disorders including schizophrenia, epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease, and others. Preclinical, but not clinical, studies found evidence for an improvement in cognitive performance after treatment with CBD. More research is needed to determine whether CBD can be effectively used as a monotherapy to treat cognitive dysfunction. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved).
