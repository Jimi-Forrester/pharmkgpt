36580956|t|Risk of perioperative stroke and cerebral autoregulation monitoring: a systematic review.
36580956|a|BACKGROUND: Perioperative stroke, delirium, and cognitive impairment could be related to management and to variations in blood pressure control, cerebral hypoperfusion and raised blood volume. Cerebral autoregulation (CAR) is a mechanism to maintain cerebral perfusion through the control of the vascular tone and hemodynamic reactions in the circulation. OBJECTIVE: The present systematic review addresses the relationship between impaired CAR and perioperative stroke by evaluating the rate of neurological complications after surgery in studies in which perioperative CAR was tested or monitored. METHODS: We included randomized clinical trials and prospective observational studies. All studies had adjusted the relative risk, hazard ratio or 95% confidence interval (95%CI) values. These estimation effects were tested using random-effects models. Heterogeneity among the selected studies was assessed using the Higgins and Thompson I2 statistics. RESULTS: The Web of Science, PubMed and EMBASE electronic databases were searched to retrieve articles. A total of 4,476 studies published between 1983 and 2019 were analyzed, but only 5 qualified for the data extraction and were included in the final analysis. The combined study cohort comprised 941 patients who underwent CAR monitoring during surgical procedures. All studies provided information about perioperative stroke, which equated to 16% (158 of 941) of the overall patient population. CONCLUSION: The present meta-analysis showed evidence of the impact of CAR impairment in the risk of perioperative stroke. On the pooled analysis, blood fluctuations or other brain insults large enough to compromise CAR were associated with the outcome of stroke (odds ratio [OR]: 2.26; 95%CI: 1.54-2.98; p < 0.0001).
