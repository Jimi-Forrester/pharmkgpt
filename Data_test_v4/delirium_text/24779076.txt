24779076|a|Delirium is a neuropsychiatric condition that may complicate any visceral disease. Its rate is especially high among patients with inflammatory diseases or metabolic disturbances and in the elderly. Brain injury concurrent with an abnormal stress response underlies the development of delirium. The clinical picture of delirium is characterized by clouding of consciousness accompanied by global cognitive and behavioral changes. According to the nature of changes in motor behavior, delirium is divided into hyperactive, hypoactive, and mixed subtypes. Special scales, such as Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU), are used to identify delirium. Management of delirium includes specific therapy for the underlying disease and adequate care. Low-dose neuroleptics, haloperidol in particular, are recommended to correct behavioral changes.
