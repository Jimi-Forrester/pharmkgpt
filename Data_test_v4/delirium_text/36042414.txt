36042414|a|BACKGROUND: We aimed to study whether physical frailty and cognitive impairment (CI) increase the risk of recurrent hospitalizations in older adults, independent of comorbidity, and disability. METHODS: Two thousand five hundred forty-nine community-dwelling participants from the National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS) with 3 + years of continuous Medicare coverage from linked claims data were included. We used the marginal means/rates recurrent events model to investigate the association of baseline CI (mild CI or dementia) and physical frailty, separately and synergistically, with the number of all-source vs. Emergency Department (ED)-admission vs. direct admission hospitalizations over 2 years. RESULTS: 17.8% of participants had at least one ED-admission hospitalization; 12.7% had at least one direct admission hospitalization. Frailty and CI, modeled separately, were both significantly associated with risk of recurrent all-source (Rate Ratio (RR) = 1.24 for frailty, 1.21 for CI; p < .05) and ED-admission (RR = 1.49 for frailty, 1.41 for CI; p < .05) hospitalizations but not direct admission, adjusting for socio-demographics, obesity, comorbidity and disability. When CI and frailty were examined together, 64.3% had neither (Unimpaired); 28.1% CI only; 3.5% Frailty only; 4.1% CI + Frailty. Compared to those Unimpaired, CI alone and CI + Frailty were predictive of all-source (RR = 1.20, 1.48, p < .05) and ED-admission (RR = 1.36, 2.14, p < .05) hospitalizations, but not direct admission, in our adjusted model. CONCLUSIONS: Older adults with both CI and frailty experienced the highest risk for recurrent ED-admission hospitalizations. Timely recognition of older adults with CI and frailty is needed, paying special attention to managing cognitive impairment to mitigate preventable causes of ED admissions and potentiate alternatives to hospitalization.
