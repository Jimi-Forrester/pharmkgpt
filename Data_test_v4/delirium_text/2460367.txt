2460367|t|Selective reduction of mRNA for the beta-amyloid precursor protein that lacks a Kunitz-type protease inhibitor motif in cortex from Alzheimer brains.
2460367|a|In poly(A) RNA from cerebral cortex obtained postmortem from victims of Alzheimer's disease (AD), an alternatively spliced mRNA for the amyloid precursor protein (APP-695 mRNA) was shown to be decreased by 65%. Another form (APP-751 mRNA) with an additional exon encoding a Kunitz-type (serine) protease inhibitor motif did not change appreciably (less than 30% decrease) in AD cortex. If this twofold increase in the APP-751 mRNA/APP-695 mRNA ratio results in a corresponding increase in the APP-751/APP-695 protein ratio, this would support the hypothesis that impaired proteolysis promotes the accumulation of abnormal proteins in the brain during AD. In the two previously known, major alternatively spliced forms of ca. 3.3 and 3.5 kb, we resolved doublet RNAs for each form that are consistent with sequence data showing multiple polyadenylation sites (J. Kang et al., 1987, Nature (London) 325, 733-736.). Smaller APP-related transcripts were also found (1.1, 1.0, 0.8, and 0.3 kb), some of which are selectively altered in AD.
