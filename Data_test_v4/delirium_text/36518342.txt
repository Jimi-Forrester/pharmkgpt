36518342|a|Studying higher brain function presents fundamental scientific challenges but has great potential for impactful translation to the clinic, supporting the needs of many patients suffering from conditions that relate to neuronal dysfunction. For many key questions relevant to human neurological conditions and clinical interventions, non-human primates (NHPs) remain the only suitable model organism and the only effective way to study the relationship between brain structure and function with the knowledge and tools currently available. Here we present three exemplary studies of current research yielding important findings that are directly translational to human clinical patients but which would be impossible without NHP studies. Our first example shows how studies of the NHP prefrontal cortex are leading to clinically relevant advances and potential new treatments for human neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression and anxiety. Our second example looks at the relevance of NHP research to our understanding of visual pathways and the visual cortex, leading to visual prostheses that offer treatments for otherwise blind patients. Finally, we consider recent advances in treatments leading to improved recovery of movement and motor control in stroke patients, resulting from our improved understanding of brain stem parallel pathways involved in movement in NHPs. The case for using NHPs in neuroscience research, and the direct benefits to human patients, is strong but has rarely been set out directly. This paper reviews three very different areas of neuroscience research, expressly highlighting the unique insights offered to each by NHP studies and their direct applicability to human clinical conditions.
