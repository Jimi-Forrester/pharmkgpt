29205019|a|A multifactorial memory disease with old-age onset forms a continuum having at one end a "clear" Alzheimer-type form, with a pathophysiology involving a central role played by the accumulation of amyloid protein, and a purely arterial disease at the other end. Most of the cases exhibit a mixed form. As the options of prevention of arterial diseases are well known, this will also provide possibilities for extensive prevention of memory diseases. Central measures include physical activity, a healthy diet and intervention in risk factors - early enough, of course. What is good for the heart is generally good for the brain as well.
