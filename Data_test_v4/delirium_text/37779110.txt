37779110|t|Association between stress-related disorders and the risk of dementia using the Korean National Sample Cohort: a matched cohort study.
37779110|a|Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with the development of dementia; however, the association of dementia risk with overall stress-related disorders is less known. This study investigated the association between stress-related disorders and the risk of dementia in a Korean nationwide sample cohort. The data analyzed in this study were acquired from the Korean National Health Insurance Service National Sample Cohort between 2002 and 2013. Using a 1:3 propensity score matching, 8906 patients with stress-related disorders and 26,718 control participants were included in the analysis. Patients with stress-related disorders had a higher risk of developing dementia after adjusting for covariates (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.15; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01-1.30) than control participants. Patients with PTSD showed the highest risk of increase (HR = 1.78) than those with other types of stress-related disorders. Patients with stress-related disorders showed the highest and significantly increased risk for Alzheimer's dementia (HR = 1.22, 95% CI 1.04-1.56). These results indicated an association between a history of stress-related disorders and the risk of dementia in the South Korean population. Further research investigating the causal mechanisms is needed.
