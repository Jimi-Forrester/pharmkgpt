17175823|t|Delirium during intravenous sedation with midazolam alone and with propofol in dental treatment.
17175823|a|A 62-year-old man visited our clinic for dental implantation under intravenous sedation. He demonstrated increased psychomotor activity and incomprehensible verbal contact during intravenous sedation. Although delirium caused by midazolam or propofol in different patients has been reported, the present case represents a delirium that developed from both drugs in the same patient, possibly because of the patient's smaller tolerance to midazolam and propofol.
