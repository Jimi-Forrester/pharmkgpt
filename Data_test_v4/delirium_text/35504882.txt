35504882|a|Neuroinflammation is regarded as a vital pathological process in spinal cord injury (SCI), which removes damaged tissue, secretes cytokines, and facilitates regeneration. Repopulation of microglia has been shown to favor recovery from SCI. However, the origin and regulatory factors of microglia repopulation after SCI remain unknown. Here, we used single-cell RNA sequencing to portray the dynamic transcriptional landscape of immune cells during the early and late phases of SCI in mice. B cells and migDCs, located in the meninges under physiological conditions, are involved in immune surveillance. Microglia quickly reduced, and peripheral myeloid cells infiltrated three days-post-injury (dpi). At 14 dpi, microglia repopulated, myeloid cells were reduced, and lymphocytes infiltrated. Importantly, genetic lineage tracing of nestin+ and Cx3cr1+ cells in vivo showed that the repopulation of microglia was derived from residual microglia after SCI. We found that residual microglia regress to a developmental growth state in the early stages after SCI. Hif1alpha promotes microglial proliferation. Conditional ablation of Hif1alpha in microglia causes larger lesion sizes, fewer axon fibers, and impaired functional recovery in the late stages after SCI. Our results mapped the immune heterogeneity in SCI and raised the possibility that targeting Hif1alpha may help in axon regeneration and functional recovery after SCI.
