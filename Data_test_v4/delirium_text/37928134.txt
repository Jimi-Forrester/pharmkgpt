37928134|t|Antipsychotic Drugs: The Antithesis to Neurorehabilitation in Models of Pre-Clinical Traumatic Brain Injury.
37928134|a|Sixty-nine million traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) are reported worldwide each year, and, of those, close to 3 million occur in the United States. In addition to neurobehavioral and cognitive deficits, TBI induces other maladaptive behaviors, such as agitation and aggression, which must be managed for safe, accurate assessment and effective treatment of the patient. The use of antipsychotic drugs (APDs) in TBI is supported by some expert guidelines, which suggests that they are an important part of the pharmacological armamentarium to be used in the management of agitation. Despite the advantages of APDs after TBI, there are significant disadvantages that may not be fully appreciated clinically during decision making because of the lack of a readily available updated compendium. Hence, the aim of this review is to integrate the existing findings and present the current state of APD use in pre-clinical models of TBI. The studies discussed were identified through PubMed and the University of Pittsburgh Library System search strategies and reveal that APDs, particularly those with dopamine2 (D2) receptor antagonism, generally impair the recovery process in rodents of both sexes and, in some instances, attenuate the potential benefits of neurorehabilitation. We believe that the compilation of findings represented by this exhaustive review of pre-clinical TBI + APD models can serve as a convenient source for guiding informed decisions by critical care clinicians and physiatrists contemplating APD use for patients exhibiting agitation.
