10188931|a|The messenger RNA expression of presenilin-1, an important gene responsible for early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease, was investigated in the embryonic rat brain with in situ hybridization histochemistry using an oligonucleotide probe specific to the messenger RNA. It was also compared with that of beta-amyloid precursor protein messenger RNA. Presenilin-1 and beta-amyloid precursor protein messenger RNA were abundantly expressed throughout the central nervous system in the embryonic day 13, 17 and 20 rat brain. Presenilin-1 messenger RNA was strongly expressed in both neuroepithelium and differentiating fields. In contrast, beta-amyloid precursor protein messenger RNA was preferentially expressed in differentiating fields, while low expression of beta-amyloid precursor protein messenger RNA was seen in neuroepithelium. Although the expression patterns of these two messenger RNAs were basically similar, there seemed to be a tendency that presenilin-1 messenger RNA was preferentially expressed in immature neurons, while beta-amyloid precursor protein messenger RNA was preferentially expressed in mature neurons, suggesting that presenilin-1 is expressed earlier than beta-amyloid precursor protein and that presenilin-1 is involved in beta-amyloid precursor protein processing. These data raise the possibility that presenilin-1 and beta-amyloid precursor protein co-operatively play pivotal roles in rat neurogenesis.
