32034757|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Immunotherapeutic intervention is one of the most promising strategies for the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although they showed great success in AD mouse models, the clinical trials of many immune approaches failed due to low efficacy and safety. Thus, an animal model which can show the potential side effects of vaccines or antibodies is urgently needed. In this study, we generated EAE/AD mice by crossing APP/PS1 mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mice. We then investigated the efficacy and safety of two vaccines: the immunogens of which were Abeta1-42 aggregates (Abeta42 vaccine) and an oligomer-specific conformational epitope (AOE1 vaccine), respectively. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: EAE/AD mice were immunized with the Abeta42 vaccine or AOE1 vaccine five times at biweekly intervals. After the final immunization, cognitive function was evaluated by the Morris water maze, Y maze, and object recognition tests. Neuropathological changes in the mouse brains were analysed by immunohistochemistry and ELISA. KEY RESULTS: In contrast to previous findings in conventional AD animal models, Abeta42 immunization promoted neuroinflammation, enhanced Abeta levels and plaque burden, and failed to restore cognitive deficits in EAE/AD mice. By contrast, AOE1 immunization dramatically attenuated neuroinflammation, reduced Abeta levels, and improved cognitive performance in EAE/AD mice. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: These results suggest that the EAE/AD mouse model can exhibit the potential side effects of AD immune approaches that conventional AD animal models fail to display. Furthermore, strategies specifically targeting Abeta oligomers may be safe and show clinical benefit for AD treatment.
