38463086|t|Relation between frailty and adverse outcomes in elderly patients with gastric cancer: a scoping review.
38463086|a|Background: Playing an exemplary role, frailty have crucial effect on the preoperative evaluation of elderly patients. Previous studies have shown that frailty is associated with complications and mortality in patients with gastric cancer (GC). However, with the development of the concept of "patient-centered", the range of health-related outcomes is broad. The differences in relation between frailty and various adverse outcomes will be further explored. Method: The PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wan Fang, and Chinese Biomedical Literature databases were searched for keywords, including frailty (such as frail) and gastric cancer (such as stomach neoplasms or stomach cancer or gastrectomy or gastric surgery). The search period is until August 2023. The included studies were observational or cohort studies with postoperative related adverse outcomes as primary or secondary outcome measures. Valid assessment tools were used. The Quality Assessment Tool for Observational Cohort and Cross-sectional Studies was used to assess methodological quality in the included literature. Result: Fifteen studies were included, including 4 cross-sectional studies, 8 retrospective cohort studies, and 3 prospective cohort studies. Among them, 6 studies were rated as "Good" and 9 studies were rated as "Fair," indicating that the quality of the literature was high. Then, 10 frailty assessment tools were summarized and classified into two broad categories in accordance with frailty models. Results of the included studies indicated that frailty in elderly patients with GC was associated with postoperative complications, mortality, hospital days, readmissions, quality of life, non-home discharge, and admission to the intensive care unit. Conclusion: This scoping review concludes that high levels of preoperative frailty increase the risk of adverse outcomes in elderly patients with GC. Frailty will be widely used in the future clinical evaluation of elderly gastric cancer patients, precise risk stratification should be implemented for patients, and frailty management should be implemented well to reduce the occurrence of adverse treatment outcomes.
