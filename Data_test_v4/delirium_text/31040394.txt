31040394|a|OBJECTIVE: Myeloid-related protein-14 (MRP14) and its binding partner MRP8 play an essential role in innate immune function and have been implicated in a variety of inflammatory diseases. However, the role of MRP14 in obesity-induced inflammation and insulin resistance is not well defined. This study investigated the role of MRP14 in macrophage-mediated adipose tissue inflammation and obesity-induced insulin resistance. SUBJECTS AND RESULTS: Wild-type (WT) and Mrp14-/- mice were fed with a high-fat diet or normal chow for 12 weeks. Tissue-resident macrophages in both adipose tissue and liver from obese WT mice expressed higher levels of MRP14 in the visceral adipose fat and liver compared with the lean mice. Mrp14-/- mice demonstrated a significantly improved postprandial insulin sensitivity, as measured by intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test and insulin tolerance testing. Macrophages secreted MRP14 in response to inflammatory stimuli, such as LPS. Extracellular MRP8/14 induced the production of CCL5 and CXCL9. Deficiency of MRP14 did not affect macrophage proliferation, mitochondrial respiration, and glycolytic function, but Mrp14-/- macrophages showed a reduced ability to attract T cells. Depletion of the extracellular MRP14 reduced the T cell attracting ability of WT macrophages to a level similar to Mrp14-/- macrophages. CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that MRP14 deficiency decreases obesity-induced insulin resistance and MRP8/14 regulates T-cell recruitment through the induction of T-cell chemoattractant production from macrophages.
