18414268|t|Dementia care. Part 2: understanding and managing behavioural challenges.
18414268|a|Management of dementia should focus on the maintenance of function and independence for the person with the disease. Non-pharmacological interventions to manage dementia include reality orientation, aromatherapy and validation therapy. Non-pharmacological ways of managing challenging behaviour are recommended in current guidance. Drug treatments, which may stabilize the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease or slow down further progression for a time, have been available in the United Kingdom since 1997 and may help some people with dementia. There are high levels of stress, distress and psychological illness in family caregivers of individuals with dementia, and practitioners are well placed to signpost carers to appropriate support organizations.
