36804419|a|End-stage renal disease (ESRD) results in hippocampal volume reduction, but the hippocampal subfields atrophy patterns cannot be identified. We explored the volumes and asymmetry of the hippocampal subfields and their relationships with memory function and biochemical changes. Hippocampal global and subfields volumes were derived from 33 ESRD patients and 46 healthy controls (HCs) from structural MRI. We compared the volume and asymmetric index of each subfield, with receiver operating characteristic curve analysis to evaluate the differentiation between ESRD and HCs. The relations of hippocampal subfield volumes with memory performance and biochemical data were investigated in ESRD group. ESRD patients had smaller hippocampal subfield volumes, mainly in the left CA1 body, left fimbria, right molecular layer head, right molecular layer body and right HATA. The right molecular layer body exhibited the highest accuracy for differentiating ESRD from HCs, with a sensitivity of 80.43% and specificity of 72.73%. Worse learning process (r = 0.414, p = 0.032), immediate recall (r = 0.396, p = 0.041) and delayed recall (r = 0.482, p = 0.011) was associated with left fimbria atrophy. The left fimbria volume was positively correlated with Hb (r = 0.388, p = 0.05); the left CA1 body volume was negatively correlated with Urea (r = - 0.469, p = 0.016). ESRD patients showed global and hippocampal subfields atrophy. Left fimbria atrophy was related to memory function. Anemia and Urea level may be associated with the atrophy of left fimbria and CA1 body, respectively.
