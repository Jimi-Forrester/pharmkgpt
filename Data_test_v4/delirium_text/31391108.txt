31391108|t|The functions and clinical application potential of exosomes derived from adipose mesenchymal stem cells: a comprehensive review.
31391108|a|Exosomes are extracellular membranous nanovesicles that mediate local and systemic intercellular communication by transporting proteins or nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) into target cells, thus altering the behaviors of recipient cells. Recent studies have revealed that these vesicles play a critical role in many biological functions, such as cell proliferation, immune regulation, nerve regeneration, and cancer. Adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) are now considered a multipotent and abundant tool in the field of cell therapy and regenerative medicine. ADSCs can produce and secrete many exosomes, which inherit multiple functions of cells. Therefore, in this review, we will introduce the characteristics of exosomes derived from ADSCs (ADSC-Exos), describe their functions in different biological processes, summarize the latest research achievements, describe their limitations in cell-free therapy, and provide further insights into their clinical application potential for the treatment of certain diseases.
