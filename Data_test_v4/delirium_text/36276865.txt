36276865|a|Objective: To investigate the effect of dexmedetomidine on postoperative cognitive function and delirium in elderly patients undergoing thoracoscopic lobectomy. Methods: 109 elderly patients (age is more than 65 years) who underwent thoracoscopic lobectomy in our hospital from June 2020 to Feb 2022 were randomly divided into the dexmedetomidine (DEX) group (n = 54) and the control group (n = 55). The patients in the experimental group were given dexmedetomidine by intravenous pump, intravenous pump 0.5 mug/kg within 10 minutes, and maintained the speed of 0.5 mug/(kg. h) to 30 min before the operation was ended. The control group was given the same amount of normal saline. Delirium assessment-severity (CAM-S) assessment and Mini-Cog were used to assess the severity levels of POD and POCD 24 h before, 6 hours after, one day after the operation, three days after the operation, and 1 week after the operation. Serum TNF-alphaalpha and NSE levels were assessed by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. NRS pain marks were assessed in the DEX group at postanesthesia care unit (PACU) and 24 postoperation. Surgical pierhysmographic index (SPI) evaluation was performed at five time points. Results: The Mini-Cog scores in the DEX group were markedly enhanced compared with those in the saline group 6 and 24 hours after the operation. The SPI values in the DEX group were markedly reduced within 2 min after intubation and at surgical sutures. Moreover, the CAM scores in the DEX group were markedly reduced 24 hours after the operation. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) levels were significantly decreased in the DEX group at T1~T3. Conclusion: The use of dexmedetomidine in the thoracoscopic lobectomy in elderly patients could reduce the occurrence and severity of postoperative cognitive dysfunction and delirium.
