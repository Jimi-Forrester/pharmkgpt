37233791|a|Postoperative delirium during emergence from anesthesia is the most frequent neuropsychiatric complication in the post-anesthesia care unit. In addition to increased medical and especially nursing care efforts, affected patients are threatened with delayed rehabilitation with a longer hospital stay and an increased mortality. It is therefore essential to identify risk factors at an early stage and to implement preventive measures; however, should a postoperative delirium occur in the post-anesthesia care unit despite the use of these preventive measures, it should be detected and treated at an early stage using suitable screening procedures. In this context, working instructions for delirium prophylaxis and standardized test procedures for detection of delirium have been shown to be useful. An additional drug treatment can be indicated when all nonpharmacological options have been exhausted.
