34253242|t|A paradigm shift in cell-free approach: the emerging role of MSCs-derived exosomes in regenerative medicine.
34253242|a|Recently, mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) due to their pro-angiogenic, anti-apoptotic, and immunoregulatory competencies along with fewer ethical issues are presented as a rational strategy for regenerative medicine. Current reports have signified that the pleiotropic effects of MSCs are not related to their differentiation potentials, but rather are exerted through the release of soluble paracrine molecules. Being nano-sized, non-toxic, biocompatible, barely immunogenic, and owning targeting capability and organotropism, exosomes are considered nanocarriers for their possible use in diagnosis and therapy. Exosomes convey functional molecules such as long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and micro-RNAs (miRNAs), proteins (e.g., chemokine and cytokine), and lipids from MSCs to the target cells. They participate in intercellular interaction procedures and enable the repair of damaged or diseased tissues and organs. Findings have evidenced that exosomes alone are liable for the beneficial influences of MSCs in a myriad of experimental models, suggesting that MSC- exosomes can be utilized to establish a novel cell-free therapeutic strategy for the treatment of varied human disorders, encompassing myocardial infarction (MI), CNS-related disorders, musculoskeletal disorders (e.g. arthritis), kidney diseases, liver diseases, lung diseases, as well as cutaneous wounds. Importantly, compared with MSCs, MSC- exosomes serve more steady entities and reduced safety risks concerning the injection of live cells, such as microvasculature occlusion risk. In the current review, we will discuss the therapeutic potential of MSC- exosomes as an innovative approach in the context of regenerative medicine and highlight the recent knowledge on MSC- exosomes in translational medicine, focusing on in vivo researches.
