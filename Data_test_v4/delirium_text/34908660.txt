34908660|a|BACKGROUND: The coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected millions of people across the world since early 2020. Besides the large number of case fatalities, this virus has produced significant health-related sequelae involving multiple systems of the body. As with previous coronavirus infections, this was also found to be associated with various neuropsychiatric symptoms. Psychosis has been uncommon, and the few reported cases across the world have forwarded association with either raised inflammatory markers or the consequences of social isolation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective descriptive study of 12 patients, who were admitted with COVID-19 infection and psychosis, between March 2020 and December 2020. Cases of head injury, any neurological or metabolic illnesses, and substance use disorders were excluded. RESULTS: Cases with psychosis formed only 0.19% of all cases of COVID-19 admissions. All of them were young male and employed. Most of them had abrupt onset of psychosis with confusion, delusions, hallucinations, agitation, and sleep disturbances. Investigations including inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein) and computerized tomography scans were largely normal. Medications used were mainly benzodiazepines and antipsychotics. Most of the cases resolved within the second week, and follow-up after a month did not elicit any residual symptoms in majority. Diagnosis was acute and transient psychotic disorder (about 75%), bipolar affective disorder (2 cases), and schizophrenia (one). CONCLUSIONS: The major findings included nonreactive inflammatory markers, quick resolution of symptoms, requirement of low doses of antipsychotic drugs, and no long-term sequelae.
