16639085|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review describes a variety of neuropsychological dementia studies published between January 2004 and June 2005. In selecting articles for description in the present paper, our goal was not a comprehensive review of what is an enormous and growing literature, but rather to select and describe individual interesting studies from a sufficient range of dementia-related topics to permit illustration of some of the important questions for which a neuropsychological perspective aids in the understanding of dementias. RECENT FINDINGS: Findings in the studies reviewed include a variety of different topics. Some of the themes include the following: (a) Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia, but a large body of research documents that there are important cognitive differences among various types of dementia, (b) the emerging research is also important in demonstrating the need for more sensitive clinical screening measures, (c) cognitive data are strongly predictive of functional decline, and (d) subtle declines in verbal learning appear to precede clinical Alzheimer's disease. SUMMARY: Neuropsychological data are key to progress in understanding and developing more effective treatments for Alzheimer's disease and other dementia. For instance, efforts to identify early markers of dementia will be a key component to development of early intervention strategies.
