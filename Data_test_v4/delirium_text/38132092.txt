38132092|t|Imidacloprid Induces Lysosomal Dysfunction and Cell Death in Human Astrocytes and Fibroblasts-Environmental Implication of a Clinical Case Report.
38132092|a|Imidacloprid (IMI), a neonicotinoid insecticide, has potential cytotoxic and genotoxic effects on human and experimental models, respectively. While being an emerging environmental contaminant, occupational exposure and related cellular mechanisms are unknown. Herein, we were motivated by a specific patient case where occupational exposure to an IMI-containing plant protection product was associated with the diagnosis of Bell's palsy. The aim was to investigate the toxic effects and cellular mechanisms of IMI exposure on glial cells (D384 human astrocytes) and on human fibroblasts (AG01518). IMI-treated astrocytes showed a reduction in cell number and dose-dependent cytotoxicity at 24 h. Lower doses of IMI induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lysosomal membrane permeabilisation (LMP), causing apoptosis and autophagic dysfunction, while high doses caused significant necrotic cell death. Using normal fibroblasts, we found that IMI-induced autophagic dysfunction and lysosomal damage, activated lysophagy, and resulted in a compensatory increase in lysosomes. In conclusion, the observed IMI-induced effects on human glial cells and fibroblasts provide a possible link between IMI cytotoxicity and neurological complications observed clinically in the patient exposed to this neonicotinoid insecticide.
