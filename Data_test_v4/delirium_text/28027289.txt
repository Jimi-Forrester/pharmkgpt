28027289|t|Paraoxonase-1 (PON1) rs662 Polymorphism and Its Association with Serum Lipid Levels and Longevity in the Bama Zhuang Population.
28027289|a|BACKGROUND The present study was performed to identify the association of PON1 rs662 polymorphism with serum lipid levels and human longevity in the Bama Zhuang population. MATERIAL AND METHODS PON1 genotypes were determined by Taqman SNP Genotyping Assays in 110 long-lived inhabitants (longevity group, aged 90-110 years), 110 healthy inhabitants in Bama County (control 1 group, aged 43-82 years) and 110 healthy inhabitants in Nandan County (control 2 group, aged 28-82 years) without family history of longevity. RESULTS BMI (body mass index) and TG (serum total triglyceride) level were lower in the longevity group than in the two control groups, while the contents of serum LDL-c (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol) and HDL-c (high-density lipoprotein cholesterol) and the levels of SBP (systolic blood pressure) and DBP (diastolic blood pressure) in the longevity group were higher than in the two control groups (p<0.01). Significant differences in the frequencies of three genotypes (GG, AG, and AA) were observed between the longevity group and control 2 group (chi2=15.190, p=0.001). The minor allele frequency (MAF) of rs662 was significantly higher in the longevity group than in the two control groups. The levels of HDL-c in the longevity group were different among the three genotypes (p<0.05). The levels of TG for GG and GG+AG genotypes were significantly different, while the levels of TC (total cholesterol) and HDL-c for AG and GG+AG genotypes were significantly different among the three groups (p<0.05). Serum lipid parameters were correlated with several environmental factors, including age, gender, DBP, SBP, and BMI. The association of PON1 rs662 polymorphism and serum lipid levels was different among the three groups. CONCLUSIONS PON1 polymorphism might be one of the genetic factors of longevity in the Bama Zhuang population. The PON1 rs662 SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) was associated with serum HDL-c levels in the longevity group.
