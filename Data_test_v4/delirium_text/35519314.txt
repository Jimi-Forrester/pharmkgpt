35519314|t|Inhibition of metal-induced amyloid beta-peptide aggregation by a blood-brain barrier permeable silica-cyclen nanochelator.
35519314|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative malady associated with amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) aggregation in the brain. Metal ions play important roles in Abeta aggregation and neurotoxicity. Metal chelators are potential therapeutic agents for AD because they could sequester metal ions from the Abeta aggregates and reverse the aggregation. The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a major obstacle for drug delivery to AD patients. Herein, a nanoscale silica-cyclen composite combining cyclen as the metal chelator and silica nanoparticles as a carrier was reported. Silica-cyclen was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) and dynamic light scattering (DLS). The inhibitory effect of the silica-cyclen nanochelator on Zn2+- or Cu2+-induced Abeta aggregation was investigated by using a BCA protein assay and TEM. Similar to cyclen, silica-cyclen can effectively inhibit the Abeta aggregation and reduce the generation of reactive oxygen species induced by the Cu-Abeta40 complex, thereby lessening the metal-induced Abeta toxicity against PC12 cells. In vivo studies indicate that the silica-cyclen nanochelator can cross the BBB, which may provide inspiration for the construction of novel Abeta inhibitors.
