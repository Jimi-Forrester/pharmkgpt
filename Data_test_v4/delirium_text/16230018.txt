16230018|a|A new series of donepezil-tacrine hybrid related derivatives have been synthesised as dual acetylcholinesterase inhibitors that could bind simultaneously to the peripheral and catalytic sites of the enzyme. These new hybrids combined a tacrine, 6-chlorotacrine or acridine unit as catalytic binding site and indanone (the heterocycle present in donepezil) or phthalimide moiety as peripheral binding site of the enzyme, connected through a different linker tether length. One of the synthesised compounds emerged as a potent and selective AChE inhibitor, which is able to displace propidium in a competition assay. These results seem to confirm the ability of this inhibitor to bind simultaneously to both sites of the enzyme and make it a promising lead for developing disease-modifying drugs for the future treatment of Alzheimer's disease. To gain insight into the molecular determinants that modulate the inhibitory activity of these compounds, a molecular modelling study was performed to explore their binding to the enzyme.
