38441274|a|INTRODUCTION: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) biomarkers are needed for indexing early biological stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD), such as plasma amyloid-beta (Abeta42/40) positivity in Abeta positron emission tomography (PET) negative individuals. METHODS: Diffusion free-water (FW) MRI was acquired in individuals with normal cognition (NC) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) with Abeta plasma-/PET- (NC = 22, MCI = 60), plasma+/PET- (NC = 5, MCI = 20), and plasma+/PET+ (AD dementia = 21) biomarker status. Gray and white matter FW and fractional anisotropy (FAt) were compared cross-sectionally and the relationships between imaging, plasma and PET biomarkers were assessed. RESULTS: Plasma+/PET- demonstrated increased FW (24 regions) and decreased FAt (66 regions) compared to plasma-/PET-. FW (16 regions) and FAt (51 regions) were increased in plasma+/PET+ compared to plasma+/PET-. Composite brain FW correlated with plasma Abeta42/40 and p-tau181. DISCUSSION: FW imaging changes distinguish plasma Abeta42/40 positive and negative groups, independent of group differences in cognitive status, Abeta PET status, and other plasma biomarkers (i.e., t-tau, p-tau181, glial fibrillary acidic protein, neurofilament light). HIGHLIGHTS: Plasma Abeta42/40 positivity is associated with brain microstructure decline. Plasma+/PET- demonstrated increased FW in 24 total GM and WM regions. Plasma+/PET- demonstrated decreased FAt in 66 total GM and WM regions. Whole-brain FW correlated with plasma Abeta42/40 and p-tau181 measures. Plasma+/PET- demonstrated decreased cortical volume and thickness.
