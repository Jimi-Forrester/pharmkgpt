37861025|t|Recent Advancements in the Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease: A Multitarget-directed Ligand Approach.
37861025|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease and one of the leading causes of progressive dementia, affecting 50 million people worldwide. Many pathogenic processes, including amyloid beta aggregation, tau hyperphosphorylation, oxidative stress, neuronal death, and deterioration of the function of cholinergic neurons, are associated with its progression. The one-compound-one-target treatment paradigm was unsuccessful in treating AD due to the multifaceted nature of Alzheimer's disease. The recent development of multitarget-directed ligand research has been explored to target the complementary pathways associated with the disease. We aimed to find the key role and progress of MTDLs in treating AD; thus, we searched for the past ten years of literature on "Pub- Med", "ScienceDirect", "ACS" and "Bentham Science" using the keywords neurodegenerative diseases, Alzheimer's disease, and multitarget-directed ligands. The literature was further filtered based on the quality of work and relevance to AD. Thus, this review highlights the current advancement and advantages of multitarget-directed ligands over traditional single-targeted drugs and recent progress in their development to treat AD.
