38852227|a|INTRODUCTION: An increasing body of research suggests that stress and allostatic load are related to cognitive dysfunction and neurodegeneration. OBJECTIVES: to determine the relationship between allostatic load (AL) and cognitive status in older adults classified with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). METHODOLOGY: Using the Brazilian Memory and Aging Study (BRAMS) database, we analyzed data from 57 older adults with SCD and MCI. Blood neuroendocrine (cortisol, DHEA-s), inflammatory (C-reactive protein, fibrinogen), metabolic (HbA1c, HDL-cholesterol, total cholesterol, creatinine), and cardiovascular (blood pressure, waist/hip ratio) were transformed into an AL index. RESULTS: Despite a significant difference in the univariate analysis between waist/hip ratio (0.94 in the MCI group vs. 0, 88 in the SCD group, p = 0.03), total cholesterol levels (194 vs. 160, p = 0.02), and AL index (36.9 % in the MCI group vs. 27.2 % in the SCD group, p = 0.04), AL was not associated with SCD or MCI in the multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that different profiles of AL in MCI compared to individuals with SCD could be due to cofounding factors. These findings need to be confirmed in longitudinal studies investigating profiles of AL changes at preclinical and prodromal stages of Alzheimer's disease.
