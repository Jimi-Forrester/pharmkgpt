37577268|a|We present a complex case of a multimorbid elderly patient admitted with septic shock, suspected to be secondary to aspiration pneumonia, who subsequently developed an intestinal obstruction due to an ileocecal junction mass. Despite conservative management, the patient's clinical status deteriorated and required comprehensive palliative care. This case highlights the challenges in managing patients with multimorbidities, the importance of a multidisciplinary approach, and the central role of palliative care in the setting of advanced disease. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the above method to safely transit an elderly male with a recent diagnosis of colon cancer with malignant intestinal obstruction, initiated on total parenteral nutrition (TPN). This study emphasizes the successful implementation of an innovative, multidisciplinary checklist for managing elderly palliative care patients on home total parenteral nutrition (HTPN) in Al Ain, Abu Dhabi. The collaborative approach adopted by the multidisciplinary team (MDT), coupled with comprehensive staff training, patient and caregiver education, and ongoing monitoring and support, facilitated the seamless integration of HTPN into the patient's care plan. The positive outcomes observed in this case underscore the potential of such tailored interventions to bridge the existing gap in HTPN implementation within the region, thus improving the quality of life and overall well-being of elderly patients requiring specialized nutrition support.
