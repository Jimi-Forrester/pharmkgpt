32433128|a|The authors retrospectively examined 39 patients with head and neck reconstruction using a free-flap transfer with microsurgery in elderly patients aged over 80 years in our hospital. They investigated postoperative local complications, postoperative systemic complications, day of ambulation, the presence of delirium, the postoperative oral intake ratio, and the reconstructive method in mandibular reconstruction patients. There were 12 postoperative local complications. And postoperative systemic complications were detected in 19 patients; however, 17 of these were respiratory disorders due to pneumonia. There were 17 patients with postoperative delirium. Oral intake was resumed after an average of 14.9 days. Of these, 34 patients were eventually able to eat some kind of food. The incidence of local complications in elderly free-flap reconstruction patients was similar to that in young people. However, the rate of systemic complications was much higher in elderly patients. The authors suggest that free-flap reconstruction can be performed relatively safely in elderly people when a detailed preoperative surgical plan.
