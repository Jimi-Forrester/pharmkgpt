37600667|t|Admixture mapping of peripheral artery disease in a Dominican population reveals a putative risk locus on 2q35.
37600667|a|Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a form of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, affecting ~8 million Americans, and is known to have racial and ethnic disparities. PAD has been reported to have a significantly higher prevalence in African Americans (AAs) compared to non-Hispanic European Americans (EAs). Hispanic/Latinos (HLs) have been reported to have lower or similar rates of PAD compared to EAs, despite having a paradoxically high burden of PAD risk factors; however, recent work suggests prevalence may differ between sub-groups. Here, we examined a large cohort of diverse adults in the BioMe biobank in New York City. We observed the prevalence of PAD at 1.7% in EAs vs. 8.5% and 9.4% in AAs and HLs, respectively, and among HL sub-groups, the prevalence was found at 11.4% and 11.5% in Puerto Rican and Dominican populations, respectively. Follow-up analysis that adjusted for common risk factors demonstrated that Dominicans had the highest increased risk for PAD relative to EAs [OR = 3.15 (95% CI 2.33-4.25), p < 6.44 x 10-14]. To investigate whether genetic factors may explain this increased risk, we performed admixture mapping by testing the association between local ancestry and PAD in Dominican BioMe participants (N = 1,813) separately from European, African, and Native American (NAT) continental ancestry tracts. The top association with PAD was an NAT ancestry tract at chromosome 2q35 [OR = 1.96 (SE = 0.16), p < 2.75 x 10-05) with 22.6% vs. 12.9% PAD prevalence in heterozygous NAT tract carriers versus non-carriers, respectively. Fine-mapping at this locus implicated tag SNP rs78529201 located within a long intergenic non-coding RNA (lincRNA) LINC00607, a gene expression regulator of key genes related to thrombosis and extracellular remodeling of endothelial cells, suggesting a putative link of the 2q35 locus to PAD etiology. Efforts to reproduce the signal in other Hispanic cohorts were unsuccessful. In summary, we showed how leveraging health system data helped understand nuances of PAD risk across HL sub-groups and admixture mapping approaches elucidated a putative risk locus in a Dominican population.
