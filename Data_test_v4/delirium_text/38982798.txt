38982798|a|INTRODUCTION: Evidence has emerged that cardiometabolic multimorbidity (CMM) is associated with dementia, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. METHODS: This population-based study included 5704 older adults. Of these, data were available in 1439 persons for plasma amyloid-beta (Abeta), total tau, and neurofilament light chain (NfL) and in 1809 persons for serum cytokines. We defined CMM following two common definitions used in previous studies. Data were analyzed using general linear, logistic, and mediation models. RESULTS: The presence of CMM was significantly associated with an increased likelihood of dementia, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and vascular dementia (VaD) (p < 0.05). CMM was significantly associated with increased plasma Abeta40, Abeta42, and NfL, whereas CMM that included visceral obesity was associated with increased serum cytokines. The mediation analysis suggested that plasma NfL significantly mediated the association of CMM with AD. DISCUSSION: CMM is associated with dementia, AD, and VaD in older adults. The neurodegenerative pathway is involved in the association of CMM with AD. HIGHLIGHTS: The presence of CMM was associated with increased likelihoods of dementia, AD, and VaD in older adults. CMM was associated with increased AD-related plasma biomarkers and serum inflammatory cytokines. Neurodegenerative pathway was partly involved in the association of CMM with AD.
