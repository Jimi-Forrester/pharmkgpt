37900963|a|The aim of this retrospective cohort study is to understand if and how much the preventive self-isolation approach might have been a valid model to avoid care-related infection, not only from COVID-19 but also from other non-viral infectious diseases. From March to May 2020, the healthcare and management staff of the Villa Santa Maria long-term care facilities, located in the village of Montenero di Bisaccia (Campobasso, Molise, Italy), decided to carry out a preventive self-isolation plan to safeguard the residents from SARS-CoV-2. The impact on other infectious diseases was evaluated by analyzing the antibiotic therapies prescription trend among the inpatients. Our data showed that although self-isolation protected residents and caregivers from SARS-CoV-2, it can also be associated with mobility reduction, leading to an increase in bedridden pathologies, namely, pressure ulcers and pressure sores. The simultaneous isolation of residents and caregivers in the same location significantly reduced any outside influence as a cause of possible infections.
