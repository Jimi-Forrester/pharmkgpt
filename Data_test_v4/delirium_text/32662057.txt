32662057|a|The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) crisis has led to a relative unavailability of anaesthesiological support for non-acute cardiac care. Currently, transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TF-TAVI) is predominantly performed as an elective catheterisation laboratory (cath lab) procedure. Hence, the performance of TAVI could come to a halt amidst the COVID-19 crisis. Our study population comprised 90 patients treated with TF-TAVI, with local analgesia performed by our dedicated cath lab nurses. The patients had a mean age of 80 +- 5 years and 59% were male, with a predicted surgical risk of 2.2 +- 0.9/3.1 +- 2.4% (Society of Thoracic Surgeons Predicted Risk of Mortality [STS-PROM] score/EuroSCORE II), depicting a contemporary, lower-risk population. The composite endpoint of device success (Valve Academic Research Consortium [VARC]-2) was reached in all patients. No patients showed more than mild paravalvular leakage (3/90, 3.3%). Overall, intravenous medication was sparsely used during the procedure, with 48 of the 90 (53%) patients receiving no unplanned intravenous medication. There was neither procedural nor in-hospital mortality. The performance of TF-TAVI using local analgesia only, managed by a dedicated nurse instead of an anaesthesiologist, was shown to be feasible and safe in a selected group of patients. This strategy may (temporarily) eliminate the need for an anaesthesiologist to be present in the cath lab and enables ongoing TAVI treatment amidst the global COVID-19 crisis.
