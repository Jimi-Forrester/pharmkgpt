35711619|t|Zn(II) coordination polymers: therapeutic activity and nursing application values against coronary heart disease.
35711619|a|In the current research, two coordination polymers (CPs) have been produced solvothermally on the basis of a semi-rigid multifunctional tricarboxylate, i.e., 5-(3,4-dicarboxylphenoxy) nicotic acid (H3L), and the chemical compositions of the two compounds are [Zn(H2L)2(H2O)2] 1 and [Zn(HL)(2,2'-bpy)] (2, 2,2'-bpy = 2,2'-bipyridine), respectively. The structures and CHN analysis of both complexes were researched. The structural analysis results show that complex 1 features a 2D layered network with sql-type topology and complex 2 demonstrates a 2D layered network with uninodal hcb topology. The therapeutic activity and nursing application values of compounds against coronary heart disease were explored, and their relevant mechanism was assessed in meantime. The endothelin (ET) and prostacyclin (PGI2) contents released by the arterial endothelial cells into plasma were determined with ELISA assay. In addition to this, the alpha granule membrane protein 140 (GMP140) on the platelet was determined with real-time RT-PCR assay.
