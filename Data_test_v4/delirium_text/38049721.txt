38049721|a|BACKGROUND: Venom phospholipase D (PLDs), dermonecrotic toxins like, are the major molecules in the crude venom of scorpions, which are mainly responsible for lethality and dermonecrotic lesions during scorpion envenoming. The purpose of this study was fivefold: First, to identify transcripts coding for venom PLDs by transcriptomic analysis of the venom glands from Androctonus crassicauda, Hottentotta saulcyi, and Hemiscorpius lepturus; second, to classify them by sequence similarity to known PLDs and motif extraction method; third, to characterize scorpion PLDs; fourth to structural homology analysis with known dermonecrotic toxins; and fifth to investigate phylogenetic relationships of the PLD proteins. RESULTS: We found that the venom gland of scorpions encodes two PLD isoforms: PLD1 ScoTox-beta and PLD2 ScoTox-alpha I. Two highly conserved regions shared by all PLD1s beta are GAN and HPCDC (HX2PCDC), and the most important conserved regions shared by all PLD2s alpha are two copies of the HKDG (HxKx4Dx6G) motif. We found that PLD1 beta is a 31-43 kDa acidic protein containing signal sequences, and PLD2 alpha is a 128 kDa basic protein without known signal sequences. The gene structures of PLD1 beta and PLD2 alpha contain 6 and 21 exons, respectively. Significant structural homology and similarities were found between the modeled PLD1 ScoTox-beta and the crystal structure of dermonecrotic toxins from Loxosceles intermedia. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report on identifying PLDs from A. crassicauda and H. saulcyi venom glands. Our work provides valuable insights into the diversity of scorpion PLD genes and could be helpful in future studies on recombinant antivenoms production.
