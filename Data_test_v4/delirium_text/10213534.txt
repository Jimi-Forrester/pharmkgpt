10213534|t|Executive dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease.
10213534|a|Executive functioning was examined in 20 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 20 normal elderly subjects. The results showed that AD patients present lower performance compared to control subjects in all executive tasks, confirming that some executive deficits may be present in the first stages of the disease. A factorial analysis suggested that these deficits can be related to two domains of the executive functions: the inhibition abilities and the capacity to co-ordinate simultaneously storage and processing of information. Moreover, the performance on these factors is correlated to different anterior and posterior cortical areas.
