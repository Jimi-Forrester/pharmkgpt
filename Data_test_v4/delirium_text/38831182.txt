38831182|a|Aging plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD), contributing to the onset and progression of vascular cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID). In older adults, CSVD often leads to significant pathological outcomes, including blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, which in turn triggers neuroinflammation and white matter damage. This damage is frequently observed as white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) in neuroimaging studies. There is mounting evidence that older adults with atherosclerotic vascular diseases, such as peripheral artery disease, ischemic heart disease, and carotid artery stenosis, face a heightened risk of developing CSVD and VCID. This review explores the complex relationship between peripheral atherosclerosis, the pathogenesis of CSVD, and BBB disruption. It explores the continuum of vascular aging, emphasizing the shared pathomechanisms that underlie atherosclerosis in large arteries and BBB disruption in the cerebral microcirculation, exacerbating both CSVD and VCID. By reviewing current evidence, this paper discusses the impact of endothelial dysfunction, cellular senescence, inflammation, and oxidative stress on vascular and neurovascular health. This review aims to enhance understanding of these complex interactions and advocate for integrated approaches to manage vascular health, thereby mitigating the risk and progression of CSVD and VCID.
