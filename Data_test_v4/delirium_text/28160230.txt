28160230|t|Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMSs): Are They Improving Drug Safety? A Critical Review of REMSs Requiring Elements to Assure Safe Use (ETASU).
28160230|a|Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMSs) with Elements to Assure Safe Use (ETASU) are requested for drugs with significant safety risks. We reviewed REMS programs issued since 2011 to evaluate their rationales, characteristics, and consistencies, and evaluated their impact on improving drug safety. We conducted a literature search and a survey of relevant websites (FDA, manufacturers, and REMSs). ETASU characteristics were summarized. REMS risks were compared with labeled risks, including black box warnings. Forty-two programs were analyzed. Seven incorporated drugs of the same class. Most drugs (57%) were indicated for an orphan disease. A single risk was mentioned in 24 REMSs, and multiple risks in 18. Embryo-fetal toxicity and abuse or misuse were the most frequent risks. All risks were identified during clinical development but some were hypothetical. Thirty-six drugs had a black box warning. REMS risks and black box risks differed for 11 drugs. A drug with multiple indications could have a REMS for one of them but not for another. Most REMSs required prescriber training and certification, half required dispenser certification and patient enrolment. REMSs were revised multiple times and only three (7%) were discontinued. No data were available to establish whether REMSs were effective in improving drug safety. Some REMSs were deemed inefficient. REMSs with ETASU continue to be implemented but their impact on improving drug safety is still not documented. Hence, one of the main requirements of the FDA Amendments Act of 2007 is not being addressed. In addition, REMSs are complex and their logic is inconsistent; we recommend a thorough re-evaluation of the REMS program.
