2578057|t|Chromatin proteins share antigenic determinants with neurofilaments.
2578057|a|Antigenic determinants common to distinct proteins may be unambiguously identified by the use of monoclonal antibodies. Some monoclonal antibodies to mammalian neurofilaments have recently been shown to cross-react with the neurofibrillary tangles found at high density in the brains of senile dements with Alzheimers disease (SDAT). Here, we show that these antibodies also cross-react with chromatin proteins, including the linker histones H1 and H1(0). Elevated levels of histone H1(0) have also been reported in SDAT brains.
