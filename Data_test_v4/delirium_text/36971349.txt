36971349|a|PURPOSE: To monitor the metabolic turnover of beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) oxidation using 2 H-MRS in conjunction with intravenous administration of 2 H labeled BHB. METHODS: Nine-month-old mice were infused with [3,4,4,4]-2 H4 -BHB (d4 -BHB; 3.11 g/kg) through the tail vein using a bolus variable infusion rate for a period of 90 min. The labeling of downstream cerebral metabolites from the oxidative metabolism of d4 -BHB was monitored using 2 H-MRS spectra acquired with a home-built 2 H surface coil on a 9.4T preclinical MR scanner with a temporal resolution of 6.25 min. An exponential model was fit to the BHB and glutamate/glutamine (Glx) turnover curves to determine rate constants of metabolite turnover and to aid in the visualization of metabolite time courses. RESULTS: Deuterium label was incorporated into Glx from BHB metabolism through the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, with an increase in the level of [4,4]-2 H2 -Glx (d2 -Glx) over time and reaching a quasi-steady state concentration of ~0.6 +- 0.1 mM following 30 min of infusion. Complete oxidative metabolic breakdown of d4 -BHB also resulted in the formation of semi-heavy water (HDO), with a four-fold (10.1 to ~42.1 +- 7.3 mM) linear (R2  = 0.998) increase in its concentration by the end of infusion. The rate constant of Glx turnover from d4 -BHB metabolism was determined to be 0.034 +- 0.004 min-1 . CONCLUSION: 2 H-MRS can be used to monitor the cerebral metabolism of BHB with its deuterated form by measuring the downstream labeling of Glx. The integration of 2 H-MRS with deuterated BHB substrate provides an alternative and clinically promising MRS tool to detect neurometabolic fluxes in healthy and disease conditions.
