35912744|a|BACKGROUND: The identification of risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection and mortality in patients with dementia is a key aspect to support clinical decisions and public health interventions. OBJECTIVE: To assess the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 related death in a cohort of patients with dementia residing in the Lazio region and to investigate predicting factors for both infection and mortality. METHODS: This population-based study used information from administrative databases and the SARS-CoV-2 infection surveillance system. Patients with dementia (age >=65) were enrolled as of December 31, 2019 and followed-up until February 28, 2021. Cumulative risk of infection and death within 60 days of infection onset, and age-standardized incidence (SIR) and mortality (SMR) ratios were calculated. Logistic regression models were applied to identify factors associated with infection and mortality. RESULTS: Among 37,729 dementia patients, 2,548 had a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The crude risk of infection was 6.7%. An increase in risk of infection was observed both in women (SIR 1.72; 95% CI 1.64-1.80) and men (SIR 1.43; 95% CI 1.33-1.54). Pneumonia, cerebrovascular and blood diseases, femur fracture, anxiety, antipsychotic and antithrombotic use were associated with an increased risk of infection. The crude risk of death was 31.0%, the SMRs 2.32 (95% CI 2.05-2.65) for men, and 2.82 (95% CI 2.55-3.11) for women. Factors associated with mortality included: male gender, age >=85, symptoms at the diagnosis, antipsychotic and systemic antibiotics treatment. CONCLUSION: These findings emphasize the need of close and tailored monitoring of dementia patients to reduce the impact of COVID-19 on this fragile population.
