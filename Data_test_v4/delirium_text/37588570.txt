37588570|a|The present research was framed to determine the key compounds present in the plant Ocimum gratissimum L. targeting protein molecules of Diabetes Mellitus (DM) by employing In-silico approaches. Phytochemicals previously reported to be present in this herb were collated through literature survey and public phytochemical databases, and their probable targets were anticipated using BindingDB (p >= 0.7). STRING and KEGG pathway databases were employed for pathway enrichment analysis. Homology modelling was executed to elucidate the structures of therapeutic targets. Further, Phytocompounds from O. gratissimum were subjected for docking with four therapeutic targets of DM by using AutoDock vina through POAP pipeline implementation. 30 compounds were predicted to target 136 protein molecules including aldose reductase, DPP4, alpha-amylase, and alpha-glucosidase. Neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, MAPK, PI3K-Akt, starch and insulin resistance were predicted to have potentially modulation by phytocompounds. Based on the phytocompound's binding score with the four targets of DM, Rutin scored the lowest binding energy (-11 kcal/mol) with Aldose reductase by forming 17 intermolecular interactions. In conclusion, based on the network and binding score, phytocompounds from O. gratissimum have a synergistic and considerable effect in the management of DM via multi-compound, multi-target, and multi-pathway mechanisms.
