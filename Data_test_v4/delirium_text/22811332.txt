22811332|a|We report the case of a 59 year old man with a rapidly progressive cognitive decline, neurologic symptoms and recurrent falls. One of the most important differential diagnoses was the lithiumintoxication with normal lithium blood levels. After reducing the lithiumdosis the neurological symptoms regressed completely, and only few cognitive impairments persisted.
