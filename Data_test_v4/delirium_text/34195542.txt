34195542|t|The diagnostic and predictive accuracy of the PRISMA-7 screening tool for frailty in older adults: A systematic review protocol.
34195542|a|Background: Older adults are at risk of adverse outcomes due to frailty. A number of frailty screening instruments have been developed to identify older adults at increased risk of frailty. This systematic review and meta-analysis will look to examine the diagnostic accuracy of the Program of Research to Integrate the Services for the Maintenance of Autonomy 7 (PRISMA-7). Methods and analysis: A systematic literature search will be conducted from 2008-February 2020 in PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, EBSCO and the Cochrane Library to identify validation studies of the PRISMA-7 tool.  A pre-specified PRISMA-7 score of >=3 (maximum score 7 points) will be used to identify frailty in older adults. Prospective or retrospective cohort studies, cross-sectional studies and the control arm of randomised controlled trials will be included that attempt to validate the diagnostic accuracy of the PRISMA-7 screening tool in older adults across all healthcare settings when compared to a reference standard. The predictive accuracy of the PRISMA-7 tool will also be explored. Study quality will be assessed by the QUADAS-2 tool. A bivariate random effects model will be used to generate pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity. Statistical heterogeneity will be explored using validated methods. Ethics and dissemination: Formal ethical approval is not required as primary data will not be collected. The results will be disseminated through a peer-reviewed publication, conference presentation and the popular press. Protocol registration: Awaiting registration with the International Prospective Register for Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO).
