27936006|t|Prognostic Value of Red Blood Cell Distribution Width in Non-Cardiovascular Critically or Acutely Patients: A Systematic Review.
27936006|a|BACKGROUND: RDW (red cell distribution width) has been reported to been associated with the prognosis of patients with cardiovascular diseases. However, RDW is often overlooked by clinicians in treating patients with non-cardiovascular diseases, especially in an emergency. The objective of this systematic review is to explore the prognostic value of RDW in non-cardiovascular emergencies. METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were systematically searched from their inception to December 31, 2015. We included studies examining the relationship between RDW and mortality rate by adjusting important covariables in non-cardiovascular emergencies. All included studies were divided into three groups. Group A: general critically ill patients; Group B: patients with infectious disease; Group C: other conditions. We extracted each study' characteristics, outcomes, covariables, and other items independently. RESULTS: A total of 32 studies were eligible for inclusion in our meta-analysis. Six studies belonged to Group A, 9 studies belonged to Group B and 17 studies belonged to Group C. Among these included studies, RDW was assessed as a continuous variable (per 1% increase) in 16 studies, as a binary variable in 8 studies, and as a categorical variable in 8 studies. In addition, AUCs (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) of RDW for predicting mortality were reported in 25 studies. All studies were published between 2011-2015. The qualities of included 32 studies were moderate or high. CONCLUSION: The present systematic review indicates that the increased RDW is significantly associated with a higher mortality rate in an non-cardiovascular emergency. The low cost and readily accessible of this laboratory variable may strengthen its usefulness in daily practice in the future.
