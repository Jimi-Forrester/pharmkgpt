12504778|a|beta-Amyloid protein 1-42 (beta42) can induce apoptosis in the cultured hippocampal neurons, suggesting that it plays an important role in causing neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease. Recently, propentofylline, a synthetic xanthine derivative, has been reported to depress ischemic degeneration of hippocampal neurons in gerbils. The present study investigated whether or not propentofylline affected the beta42-induced apoptosis of hippocampal neurons, and if so, which type of signaling machinery works in the neuroprotective action of propentofylline. Addition of propentofylline markedly attenuated the beta42-induced cell death of rat hippocampal neurons. The amyloid protein certainly induced apoptosis in the cultured hippocampal cells revealed by nuclear condensation, caspase-3 activation and an increase of Bax. Intriguingly, propentofylline blocked both the apoptotic features induced by beta42 and further induced an anti-apoptotic protein, Bcl-2, during a short time of incubation. The neuroprotective action of propentofylline was comparably replaced with dibutyryl cAMP (dbcAMP) and was completely suppressed by a low concentration of specific protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor. Taken altogether, the data strongly suggest that the protection of propentofylline on the beta42-induced neurotoxicity is caused by enhancing anti-apoptotic action through cAMP-PKA system. Propentofylline as a therapeutic agent to Alzheimer's disease is discussed.
