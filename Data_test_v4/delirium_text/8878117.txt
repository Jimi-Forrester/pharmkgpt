8878117|a|Two distinct species of amyloid beta-protein (A beta), A beta 42(43) and A beta 40, are deposited in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease and normal aged individuals. A beta 42(43), the long tailed A beta, is the initially and predominantly deposited species in senile plaques. Deposition of A beta is also observed in the aged monkey brains. We investigated the A beta species in the aged monkey brains immunocytochemically using monoclonal antibodies that discriminate between the C-termini of A beta 42(43) and A beta 40. We report here that A beta 40 as well as A beta 42(43) deposit in various types of senile plaques, including diffuse plaques of the aged monkey brain and that the ratio of A beta 40 to A beta 42(43) is higher compared with that in human brain.
