37657740|t|Novel alkyl-substituted 4-methoxy benzaldehyde thiosemicarbazones: Multi-target directed ligands for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
37657740|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder affecting mental ability and interrupts neurocognitive functions. Treating multifactorial conditions of AD with a single-target-directed drug is highly difficult. Thus, a multi-target-directed ligand (MTDL) development strategy has been developed as a promising approach for the treatment of AD. Herein, we have synthesized two novel thiosemicarbazones as MTDLs and reported their bioactivities against diverse neuropathological events involved in AD. In vitro studies revealed that both compounds exhibited promising anticholinesterase activity (AChE, IC50 = 15.98 muM, MZET and IC50 = 30.23 muM, MZMT), well supported by a detailed computational study. Both analogs have shown good thermodynamic behaviour and stability through interactions with characteristic amino acid residues throughout simulation of 100 ns against acetylcholinesterase enzyme. In an electrophysiology assay, these analogs have shown a characteristic inhibitory response against the GluN1-1a + GluN2B subunit of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. Pre-treatment of BV-2 microglial cells with MZET effectively decreased nitrite production compared to nitrite produced by lipopolysaccharide-treated cells alone. Further, the effect of MZMT and MZET on autophagy regulation was determined using stably transfected SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. MZET significantly enhanced the autophagy flux in neuroblastoma cells. A significant decrease in copper-catalysed oxidation of amyloid-beta in presence of synthesized thiosemicarbazones was also observed. Collectively, our findings indicated that these analogs have potential as effective anti-AD candidates and can be used as a prototype to develop more safer multi-targeted anti-AD drugs.
