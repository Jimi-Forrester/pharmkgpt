35408534|t|Research Progress of Natural Small-Molecule Compounds Related to Tumor Differentiation.
35408534|a|Tumor differentiation is a therapeutic strategy aimed at reactivating the endogenous differentiation program of cancer cells and inducing cancer cells to mature and differentiate into other types of cells. It has been found that a variety of natural small-molecule drugs can induce tumor cell differentiation both in vitro and in vivo. Relevant molecules involved in the differentiation process may be potential therapeutic targets for tumor cells. Compared with synthetic drugs, natural small-molecule antitumor compounds have the characteristics of wide sources, structural diversity and low toxicity. In addition, natural drugs with structural modification and transformation have relatively concentrated targets and enhanced efficacy. Therefore, using natural small-molecule compounds to induce malignant cell differentiation represents a more targeted and potential low-toxicity means of tumor treatment. In this review, we focus on natural small-molecule compounds that induce differentiation of myeloid leukemia cells, osteoblasts and other malignant cells into functional cells by regulating signaling pathways and the expression of specific genes. We provide a reference for the subsequent development of natural small molecules for antitumor applications and promote the development of differentiation therapy.
