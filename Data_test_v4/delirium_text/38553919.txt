38553919|t|Scoring systems, expert assessment, and identification of risk factors for the emergence of delirium in paediatric patients: Prospective cohort study.
38553919|a|INTRODUCTION: Emergence delirium (ED) is a transient irritative and dissociative state that arises after the cessation of anaesthesia in patients who do not respond to calming measures. There are many risk factors for ED, but the exact cause and underlying mechanism have not been determined because the definition of ED is still unclear in consensus. This study aims to determine ED incidence, identify ED risk factors and external validation of Watcha, Cravero and expert assessment to Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium (PAED) scoring system in ED prediction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study is a prospective cohort study on 79 paediatrics who underwent elective surgery with general anaesthesia. Parameter measures include the incidence of ED, ED risk factors, and the relationship between PAED, Watcha, Cravero score and expert assessment. The ED risk factor was analysed using univariate and multivariate analysis. The relationship between PAED, Watcha, Cravero score, and expert assessment was determined using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. RESULTS: The incidence of ED was 22.8%. All parameters examined in this study showed p < 0.05. Watcha's scoring correlates with the PAED scoring and shows the highest discrimination ability with AUC 0.741 and p < 0.05. CONCLUSION: The incidence of ED in paediatrics is relatively high. Compared to others, Watcha score are more reliable for ED prediction. However, some demographic and perioperative factors are not the risk factor of ED.
