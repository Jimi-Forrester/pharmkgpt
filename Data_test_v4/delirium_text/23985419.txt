23985419|a|Human neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease represent unmet medical need. There is no effective cure available on the market. Several novel therapeutic approaches targeting fundamental features of these disorders have been proposed during the last two decades. Cell therapy represents one of the most promising therapeutic avenues targeting different pathological traits of these disorders. However, there are some caveats that should be taken into the consideration including ethical issues and limited utilization for routine clinical practice. It is unlikely that cell therapy constitutes the 'magic bullet' therapeutic approach that would meet all therapeutic needs. However, in the future it can potentially bolster the effect of disease modifying drugs by improving the brain environment and regulation of inflammatory and neurotrophic pathways.
