8157733|a|The metabolic activity of circulating neutrophils from patients with senile dementia of the Alzheimer's type (SDAT) was investigated by a chemiluminescence assay and compared with that of old and young healthy controls. Neutrophils from demented patients showed a higher and faster chemiluminescence emission than those of controls when activated in vitro by autologous or heterologous sera. Granulocytes from patients with Parkinson's disease did not show an increased chemiluminescence activity. Moreover, serum from patients with SDAT depressed the chemiluminescence emission of granulocytes from young donors. Serum levels of alpha 1-antichymotrypsin (alpha 1-ACT) were also determined and were found to be higher in demented subjects than in old and young controls. These data suggest that peripheral and systemic indexes of inflammation are present in the disease and might be associated with mental deterioration.
