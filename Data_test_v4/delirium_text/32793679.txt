32793679|a|Intensive care unit (ICU)-acquired weakness is a common and serious sequela of critical illness. There is a growing body of evidence supporting the use of early mobilization in the ICU to mitigate this adverse effect. Recent data suggest that such a strategy may be feasible in patients with the most severe forms of cardiopulmonary failure-those requiring temporary mechanical circulatory support (TCS) or extracorporeal life support (ECLS). Both the modality of mechanical support and patient-specific characteristics must be taken into consideration when determining the appropriateness of an early mobilization strategy. The purpose of this review is to explore the current understanding of and evidence for mobilization and rehabilitation of patients receiving TCS or ECLS, including the identification of factors that may predict greater success for early mobilization and potential risks and contraindications to active physical therapy. While it is not yet known which of these patients are most likely to benefit from physical rehabilitation, a common theme is the importance of an interprofessional team approach to ensure patient safety and maximize the likelihood of successful mobilization.
