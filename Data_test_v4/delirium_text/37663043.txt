37663043|a|Background: Previous studies have indicated that glucose metabolism and altered hippocampal structure and function play a pivotal role in cognitive deficits in schizophrenia (SZ). This study was designed to explore the inter-relationship between glucose metabolism, hippocampal subfield volume, and cognitive function in the antipsychotics-naive first episode (ANFE) SZ patients. Methods: We chose the fasting insulin, glucose, and insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index as biomarkers of glucose metabolism. Cognitive function was assessed by the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB). The hippocampal subfield volume, glucose metabolism biomarkers, and cognitive function were evaluated in 43 ANFE SZ and 29 healthy controls (HCs). Results: Compared with HCs, SZ patients had higher fasting blood glucose and insulin levels and HOMA-IR (all p < 0.05). Correlation analysis revealed that category fluency performance was positively associated with fasting glucose level. Fasting insulin or HOMA-IR was positively associated with the hippocampal subfield volume in patients (all p<0.05). Moreover, the spatial span index score was associated with the volume of the right presubiculum, subiculum, and right hippocampal tail. In addition, multiple regression analysis found that the interaction effects of insulin x right fimbria or insulin x left fimbria were independent predictors of the MCCB total score. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that abnormal glucose metabolism and cognitive decline occur in the early stage of SZ. The interaction between abnormal glucose metabolism and hippocampal subfields was associated with cognitive functions in SZ.
