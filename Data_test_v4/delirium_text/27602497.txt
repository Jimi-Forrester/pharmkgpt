27602497|a|Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3beta (GSK3beta) is a serine/threonine kinase, known to regulate various cellular processes including proliferation, differentiation, survival, apoptosis as well as TRAIL-resistance. Thus pathways that can modulate GSK3beta axis are important targets for cancer drug development. Our earlier studies have shown that combinatorial treatment with Troglitazone (TZD) and TRAIL can induce apoptosis in TRAIL-resistant cancer cells. The current studies were undertaken to investigate whether GSK3beta pathway was modulated during this apoptosis. Our results indicated an increase in inhibitory GSK3betaSer9 phosphorylation during apoptosis, mediated via AKT. At a later time, however, TZD alone and TRAIL-TZD combination produced a dramatic reduction of GSK3beta expression, which was abolished by cycloheximide. Luciferase assays with GSK3beta-luc promoter reporter showed that TZD can effectively antagonize GSK3beta promoter activity. Since TZD is a ligand for transcription factor PPARgamma and can activate AMPK, we determined their roles on antagonism of GSK3beta. Knockdown of PPARgamma was unable to restore GSK3beta expression or antagonize GSK3betaSer9 phosphorylation. Although pretreatment with Compound C (pharmacological inhibitor of AMPK) partially rescued GSK3beta expression, knockdown of AMPKalpha1 or alpha2 alone or in combination were ineffective. These studies suggested a novel PPARgamma-AMPK-independent mechanism of targeting GSK3beta by TZD, elucidation of which might provide newer insights to improve our understanding of TRAIL-resistance.
