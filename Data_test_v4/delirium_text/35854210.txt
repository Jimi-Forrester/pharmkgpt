35854210|a|BACKGROUND: The incidence of osteoporosis increases with age. Frailty is a distinct characteristic seen in older osteoporosis patients. Poor sleep quality is common in elderly individuals. However, there are few studies on the correlation between frailty and sleep quality in elderly patients with osteoporosis in China. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted from December 8, 2020, to April 30, 2021. A total of 247 patients who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were recruited in outpatient departments at West China Hospital. A self-designed demographic data questionnaire, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and the Frailty Phenotype scale were used to evaluate the sleep quality and frailty of the participants. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to evaluate the factors affecting frailty and sleep quality in osteoporosis patients. RESULTS: A total of 231 valid questionnaires were statistically analysed. The mean frailty score was 3.2 +- 1.6 and a total of 152 (65.8%) were frailty. The mean PSQI score was 11.9 +- 4.5 and a total of 183 (79.2%) patients had poor sleep quality (PSQI > 7). Multiple logistic regression showed that female, pain, polypharmacy, activities of daily living status (ADLs), and sleep quality were independent influencing factors for frailty, while comorbidity, ADLs and frailty status were independent influencing factors for sleep quality. CONCLUSION: We found that frailty and sleep quality were prevalent and that frailty was positively correlated with the PSQI score in elderly patients with osteoporosis in China. The higher the frailty score is, the worse the sleep quality. It means the frailer old patients were, the worse their sleep quality, and poor sleep quality may increase the risk of frailty in elderly patients with osteoporosis. To manage elderly patients with osteoporosis effectively, medical staff should pay attention to frailty, sleep quality and its influencing factors.
