37039500|a|OBJECTIVES: To identify the patterns of errors in facial emotion recognition in frontotemporal dementia (FTD) subtypes compared with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and healthy controls. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis. SETTING: Participants were recruited from FRONTIER, the frontotemporal dementia research group at the University of Sydney, Australia. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 356 participants (behavioral-variant FTD (bvFTD): 62, semantic dementia (SD)-left: 29, SD-right: 14, progressive non-fluent aphasia (PNFA): 21, AD: 76, controls: 90) were included. MEASUREMENTS: Facial emotion recognition was assessed using the Facial Affect Selection Task, a word-face matching task measuring recognition of the six basic emotions (anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise), as well as neutral emotion, portrayed by black and white faces. RESULTS: Overall, all clinical groups performed significantly worse than controls with the exception of the PNFA subgroup (p = .051). The SD-right group scored worse than all other clinical groups (all p values < .027) and the bvFTD subgroup performed worse than the PNFA group (p < .001). The most frequent errors were in response to the facial emotions disgust (26.1%) and fear (22.9%). The primary error response to each target emotion was identified; patterns of errors were similar across all clinical groups. CONCLUSIONS: Facial emotion recognition is impaired in FTD and AD compared to healthy controls. Within FTD, bvFTD and SD-right are particularly impaired. Dementia groups cannot be distinguished based on error responses alone. Implications for future clinical diagnosis and research are discussed.
