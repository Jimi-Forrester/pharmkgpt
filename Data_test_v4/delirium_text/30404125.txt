30404125|t|Treatment of neglected, severely displaced, open malunion of the distal radius and ulna in an elderly person with Alzheimer's disease - a case report.
30404125|a|The case of a patient suffering from Alzheimer's disease who sustained epiphyseal, severely dislocated fractures of the distal radius and ulna is reported. As the patient was incapacitated and attempts to contact her curator failed, the decision was made on a conservative treatment of the fractures. This treatment eventually failed and resulted in malunion with exposure of bone fragments above the skin. After obtaining informed consent from her curator, a corrective osteotomy was performed using an original method, followed by fixation of bone fragments in almost anatomical position by intramedullary K wires. At a 6-month follow-up, the patient was using her hand in daily life and did not complain of any pain. An X-ray showed consolidation of the bones in the distal forearm in an acceptable position.
