39939984|a|BACKGROUND: Delirium is a common and distressing mental disorder in palliative care. To date, no delirium prediction model is available for thepalliative care population. The research aimed to develop and validate a nomogram model for predicting the occurrence of delirium in advanced cancer patients admitted to palliative care units. METHODS: This was a prospective, multicenter, observational study. Logistic regression was used to identify the independent risk factors for incident delirium among advanced cancer patients in palliative care units. Advanced cancer patients admitted to palliative care units between February 2021 and January 2023 were recruited from four hospitals in Chengdu, Sichuan Province, China. Model performance was evaluated via the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, calibration plots and decision curve analysis. RESULTS: There were 592 advanced cancer patients receiving palliative care in the development cohort, 196 in the temporal validation cohort and 65 in the external validation cohort. The final nomogram model included 8 variables (age, the Charlson comorbidity index, cognitive function, the Barthel index, bilirubin, sodium, the opioid morphine equivalent dose and the use of anticholinergic drugs). The model revealed good performance in terms of discrimination, calibration, and clinical practicability, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.846 in the training set, 0.838 after bootstrapping, 0.829 in the temporal validation and 0.803 in the external validation set. CONCLUSIONS: The model serves as a reliable tool to predict delirium onset for advanced cancer patients in palliative care units, which will facilitate early targeted preventive measures to reduce the burden of delirium.
