35047599|a|BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer is a highly heterogeneous disease, making prognosis prediction challenging. Altered energy metabolism to satisfy uncontrolled proliferation and metastasis has become one of the most important markers of tumors. However, the specific regulatory mechanism and its effect on prognosis have not been fully elucidated. AIM: To construct a prognostic polygene signature of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to lipid metabolism. METHODS: First, 9 tissue samples from patients with pancreatic cancer were collected and divided into a cancer group and a para-cancer group. All patient samples were subjected to metabolomics analysis based on liquid tandem chromatography quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry. Then, mRNA expression profiles and corresponding clinical data of pancreatic cancer were downloaded from a public database. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator Cox regression analysis was used to construct a multigene model for The Cancer Genome Atlas. RESULTS: Principal component analysis and orthogonal projections to latent structures-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) based on lipid metabolomics analysis showed a clear distribution in different regions. A Euclidean distance matrix was used to calculate the quantitative value of differential metabolites. The permutation test of the OPLS-DA model for tumor tissue and paracancerous tissue indicated that the established model was consistent with the actual condition based on sample data. A bar plot showed significantly higher levels of the lipid metabolites phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidyl ethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylethanol(PEtOH), phosphatidylmethanol (PMeOH), phosphatidylserine (PS) and diacylglyceryl trimethylhomoserine (DGTS) in tumor tissues than in paracancerous tissues. According to bubble plots, PC, PE, PEtOH, PMeOH, PS and DGTS were significantly higher in tumor tissues than in paracancerous tissues. In total, 12.3% (25/197) of genes related to lipid metabolism were differentially expressed between tumor tissues and adjacent paracancerous tissues. Six DEGs correlated with overall survival in univariate Cox regression analysis (P < 0.05), and a 4-gene signature model was developed to divide patients into two risk groups, with patients in the high-risk group having significantly lower overall survival than those in the low-risk group (P < 0.05). ROC curve analysis confirmed the predictive power of the model. CONCLUSION: This novel model comprising 4 lipid metabolism-related genes might assist clinicians in the prognostic evaluation of patients with pancreatic cancer.
