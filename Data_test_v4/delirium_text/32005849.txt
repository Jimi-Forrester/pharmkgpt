32005849|t|Whole-genome and time-course dual RNA-Seq analyses reveal chronic pathogenicity-related gene dynamics in the ginseng rusty root rot pathogen Ilyonectria robusta.
32005849|a|Ilyonectria robusta causes rusty root rot, the most devastating chronic disease of ginseng. Here, we for the first time report the high-quality genome of the I. robusta strain CD-56. Time-course (36 h, 72 h, and 144 h) dual RNA-Seq analysis of the infection process was performed, and many genes, including candidate effectors, were found to be associated with the progression and success of infection. The gene expression profile of CD-56 showed a trend of initial inhibition and then gradually returned to a profile similar to that of the control. Analyses of the gene expression patterns and functions of pathogenicity-related genes, especially candidate effector genes, indicated that the stress response changed to an adaptive response during the infection process. For ginseng, gene expression patterns were highly related to physiological conditions. Specifically, the results showed that ginseng defenses were activated by CD-56 infection and persisted for at least 144 h thereafter but that the mechanisms invoked were not effective in preventing CD-56 growth. Moreover, CD-56 did not appear to fully suppress plant defenses, even in late stages after infection. Our results provide new insight into the chronic pathogenesis of CD-56 and the comprehensive and complex inducible defense responses of ginseng root to I. robusta infection.
