36552708|t|The Importance of SGLT-2 Inhibitors as Both the Prevention and the Treatment of Diabetic Cardiomyopathy.
36552708|a|According to the 2021 report of the International Diabetes Federation (IDF), there have been approximately 573 million cases of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) among adults, which sets the disease as a major concern in healthcare worldwide. The development of T2DM is strongly promoted by unhealthy lifestyle factors associated with urbanization and western civilization. The disease is associated with a broad list of systemic complications that can result in premature death, disability and significantly reduced quality of life. The most dramatic in their consequences are cardiovascular complications of T2DM. Our work focuses on one such complication that is specific for diabetes, named diabetic cardiomyopathy (DC). In this condition cardiac dysfunction occurs despite the absence of underlying hypertension, coronary artery disease and valvular disease, which suggest a leading role for metabolic disturbances as a cause. We aimed to establish the role of relatively new hypoglycaemic drugs that have taken the medical world by storm with their broad pleiotropic effects-SGLT-2 inhibitors-in the prevention and treatment of DC at any stage.
