35414007|a|BACKGROUND: Angiostrongylus cantonensis is also known as rat lungworm. Infection with this parasite is a zoonosis that can cause eosinophilic meningitis and/or eosinophilic meningoencephalitis in humans and may lead to fatal outcomes in severe cases. In this study, we explored the mechanisms of the impairments in the cognitive functions of mice infected with A. cantonensis. METHODS: In infected mice with different infective intensities at different timepoint postinfection, loss and recovery of cognitive functions such as learning and memory abilities were determined. Neuronal death and damage to synaptic structures were analyzed by Western blotting and IHC in infected mice with different infection intensities at different timepoint postinfection. RESULTS: The results of behavioral tests, pathological examinations, and Golgi staining showed that nerve damage caused by infection in mice occurred earlier than pathological changes of the brain. BDNF was expressed on 14 day post-infection. Cleaved caspase-3 increased significantly in the late stage of infection. However, IHC on NeuN indicated that no significant changes in the number of neurons were found between the infected and uninfected groups. CONCLUSIONS: The synaptic loss caused by the infection of A. cantonensis provides a possible explanation for the impairment of cognitive functions in mice. The loss of cognitive functions may occur before severe immunological and pathological changes in the infected host.
