25201780|a|In this study, we performed gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOFMS)-based extracellular metabolic profiling on AbetaPP-transfected CHO cells (CHO-AbetaPP695) and its wildtype. Orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) was then used to identify discriminant metabolites, which gave clues on the effects of AbetaPP transgene on cellular processes. To confirm the hypotheses generated based on the metabolic data, we performed biochemical assays to gather further evidence to support our findings. The OPLS-DA showed a robust differentiation following 24 h of incubation (Q2(cum) = 0.884) and 15 discriminant metabolites were identified. In contrast, extracellular Abeta42 was identified to increase significantly in CHO-AbetaPP695 only after incubation for 48 h. The observed 24-h metabolic fluxes were associated with increased mitochondrial AbetaPP and reduced mitochondrial viabilities, which occurred before extracellular Abeta accumulation. We also investigated the therapeutic potential of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) agonists, namely rosiglitazone (RSG) and pioglitazone (PIO), by employing the same approach to characterize the metabolic profiles of CHO-AbetaPP695 treated with RSG and PIO, with or without their respective receptor blockers. Treatment with PIO was found to reduce the perturbation of the discriminant metabolites in CHO-AbetaPP695 to a larger extent than treatment with RSG. We also attributed the PIO effects on the lowering of Abeta42, and restoration of mitochondrial activity to PPARgamma and PPARalpha agonism, respectively. Taken together, PIO was demonstrated to be therapeutically superior to RSG. Our findings provide further insights into early disease stages in this AbetaPP model, and support the advancement of PIO in AD therapy.
