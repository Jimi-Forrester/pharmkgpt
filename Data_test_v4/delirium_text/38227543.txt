38227543|a|INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to investigate 12-weeks of simple and complex voluntary wheel running on Alzheimer's Disease (AD), associated biomarkers and behaviors. METHODS: 60 male Wistar rats were randomly divided into six groups: Healthy Control (Con-Sed), AD only (AD-Sed), Simple Wheel-Control (SWC), Complex Wheel-Control (CWC), Simple Wheel-AD (SWAD) and Complex Wheel-AD (CWAD). Novelty-suppressed feeding test (NSFT) and the Morris water maze (MWM) test were used to evaluate depression and memory, respectively. Ki67 was measured in the hippocampus while IL-1beta and NG2 were measured in both the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex. One-way ANOVA with Tukey's post hoc test was performed. RESULTS: AD-Sed group had significantly lower spacial memory (p < 0.001) compared to Con-Sed. Simple and complex wheel running attenuated these deficits in the SWAD and CWAD groups, respectively (p < 0.001). Only the CWAD group had significantly improved NSFT time compared to AD-Sed (p < 0.001), equivalent to the healthy wheel running groups. AD-Sed has significantly higher hippocampal concentrations of Ki67 (p = 0.01) compared to the Con-Sed. Both SWAD and CWAD had significantly reduced Ki67 with similar concentrations compared to the SWC and CWC groups (p > 0.05). AD-Sed animals also presented with significantly higher hippocampal and prefrontal cortex concentrations of IL-1beta compared to Con-Sed (p < 0.001). SWAD and CWAD had no effect in changing these concentrations. Complex wheel running significantly increased NG2 in the healthy control and AD models while simple wheel running significantly increased NG2 in the AD model. CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study suggest that complex wheel running might be more advantageous in promoting memory and neuroplasticity while reducing depression that is associated with AD.
