35528169|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a serious neurodegenerative disease. It is widely believed that the accumulation of amyloid beta (Abeta) in neurons around neurofibrillary plaques is the main pathological characteristic of AD; however, the molecular mechanism underlying these pathological changes is not clear. Baicalin is a flavonoid extracted from the dry root of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi. Studies have shown that baicalin exerts excellent anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects. In this study, an AD cell model was established by exposing SH-SY5Y cells to Abeta 1-42 and treating them with baicalin. Cell survival, cell cycle progression, and apoptosis were measured by MTT, flow cytometry, and immunofluorescence assays, respectively. The expression levels of Ras, ERK/ERK phosphorylation (p-ERK), and cyclin D1 were measured by Western blotting. In addition, whether the MEK activator could reverse the regulatory effect of baicalin on Ras-ERK signaling was investigated using Western blotting. We found that baicalin improved the survival, promoted the proliferation, and inhibited the apoptosis of SH-SY5Y cells after Abeta 1-42 treatment. Baicalin also ameliorated Abeta 1-42-induced cell cycle arrest at the S phase and induced apoptosis. Furthermore, baicalin inhibited the levels of Ras, p-ERK, and cyclin D1 induced by Abeta, and this effect could be reversed by the MEK activator. Therefore, we suggest that baicalin may regulate neuronal cell cycle progression and apoptosis in Abeta 1-42-treated SH-SY5Y cells by inhibiting the Ras-ERK signaling pathway. This study suggested that baicalin might be a useful therapeutic agent for senile dementia, especially AD.
