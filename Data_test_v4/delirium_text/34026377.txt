34026377|t|Spine Surgery in the Octogenarian Population: A Comparison of Demographics, Surgical Approach, and Healthcare Utilization With the PearlDiver Database.
34026377|a|Background With the recent advances in technology and healthcare, increasing numbers of individuals over the age of 80 will require surgical intervention for spinal pathology. Given the risk of increased complications in the elderly, a limited number of spinal surgeries are performed on octogenarians every year. This makes it difficult to generalize the trends and outcomes of these surgeries to a greater population. This study attempts to understand the trends in the safety profile and healthcare utilization across the United States for octogenarians undergoing spinal fusion and/or decompression surgery for spinal stenosis and/or degenerative disease using the PearlDiver database. Methodology Patients who underwent fusion and/or decompression for stenosis and/or degenerative diseases were extracted using International Classification of Disease ninth and tenth revisions (ICD-9 prior to October 2015, ICD-10 after) from 2007 to 2016 in the PearlDiver database. Three comparative groups were considered: (1) primary fusion without concurrent decompression, (2) primary decompression with concurrent fusion, and (3) fusion with concurrent decompression. Outcomes of interest were patient characteristics, demographics, length of stay, surgery hospitalization payments, and discharge disposition. These outcomes were compared to patients over the age of 20 who also underwent spinal surgery. Results A total of 9,715 patients who underwent spinal surgery were identified in the search. Of the 9,139 patients, 503 were octogenarians and 73 were nonagenarians. Octogenarians and nonagenarians diagnosed with spinal stenosis were more likely to undergo decompression alone rather than fusion or both fusion and decompression (21 for both fusion and decompression; p < 0.0001). Patients diagnosed with both spinal stenosis and degeneration were more likely to undergo both fusion and decompression than fusion or decompression alone (239 for both, 208 for decompression alone, and 23 for fusion alone; p < 0.0001). No statistically significant difference was found in the percentage of patients discharged home following either fusion or decompression or both surgeries (p = 0.0737). The mean length of stay for patients in the 20-79-year age group was 2.79 days, whereas for the octogenarian and nonagenarian cohort it was 3.85 days. The index hospitalization pay for patients in the 20-79-year age group was $19,220, whereas for the octogenarians and nonagenarians cohort it was $15,091. Conclusions Patients over the age of 80 were more likely to undergo either a fusion procedure or a decompression procedure alone rather than both unless they were diagnosed with spinal degeneration. The PearlDiver database analysis indicates that the length of stay for octogenarians and nonagenarians is longer than that for patients in the 20-79-year age group, and that younger patients are more likely to be discharged earlier than patients over the age of 80. Moreover, we observed that the index hospitalization pay was higher for patients over the age of 20 than for octogenarians and nonagenarians in all cases except for a fusion procedure.
