23853087|t|Wild-type, Flemish, and Dutch amyloid-beta exhibit different cytotoxicities depending on Abeta40 to Abeta42 interaction time and concentration ratio.
23853087|a|Addition of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide Abeta40 to Abeta42 can delay Abeta42 aggregation, but consequent cytotoxicity has been reported to be enhanced or diminished. In the present study, we found that cytotoxicity was enhanced when human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were incubated in a mixture of wt Abeta42 and Abeta40wt at a ratio of 1 : 10-20 (0.1 : 1-2 muM) for 24-36 h, whereas the enhancement was detected in cells incubated for longer times (48-60 h) with the less amyloidogenic Flemish Abeta40 variant or in cells incubated for as short as 12 h with the more amyloidogenic Dutch variant. Reductions in cytotoxicity by Abeta40 were most prominently observed in the Flemish and wt Abeta40/Abeta42 mixture at ratio 1 : 20 incubated for a short time (~12 h). The most cytotoxic Abeta40/Abeta42 mixtures were enriched in Abeta protofibril-like structures, implying a strong correlation between cytotoxicity and this structure, the formation of which was dependent on amyloidogenic properties and incubation time. The consequences of the interactions were probably because of the different amyloidogenic properties of the Abeta40 variants, rather than to those of Abeta42, because aggregation rates of Abeta40 variants were highly dependent on sequence, whereas those of Abeta42 variants were not. These studies highlight a potential role for Abeta40 in cytotoxicity and provide novel mechanistic insights into the pathogenesis of each familial Alzheimer's disease-associated Abeta40 variant.
