38689485|a|OBJECTIVE: Delirium is an under-recognized problem in critically ill children. Although delirium is common in adults hospitalized with COVID-19, the relationship between pediatric COVID-19 and delirium has not been described. To address this gap, we characterized delirium in critically ill children with different manifestations of COVID-19 and investigated associations among demographic, disease, and treatment factors. We hypothesized that multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) would be associated with a higher incidence of delirium given its underlying pathophysiology of hyperinflammation. DESIGN: Retrospective, single-center cohort study. SETTING: Quaternary-care pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). PATIENTS: Children less than 18 years of age hospitalized in the PICU between March 2020 and March 2023 with either active SARS-CoV-2 infection or serological evidence of prior infection. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The cohort included 149 PICU hospitalizations among children with evidence of COVID-19. Patients were categorized by reason for PICU admission: 75 (50%) for COVID-19 respiratory disease, 36 (24%) MIS-C, and 38 (26%) any other primary reason with positive COVID-19 testing. Delirium was diagnosed in 43 (29%) patients. Delirium incidence was highest in patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) (56% vs 7.5% in patients who did not require IMV, p < .001). Patients who were exposed to opioids, dexmedetomidine, paralytics or benzodiazepines more frequently experienced delirium compared to those unexposed (p < .001, p < .001, p < .001 and p  =  .001, respectively). After multivariable adjustment, delirium was associated with IMV (HR 3 [95% CI 1.5-5.7]), female sex (HR 2.4 [1.2-4.7]), and developmental disability (HR 3.4 [95% CI 1-11.1]). There was no association between delirium and reason for PICU hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: Delirium was common among children hospitalized with COVID-19. The overall incidence was much less than has been reported in adults with COVID-19. Delirium reduction efforts should focus on children with developmental disability and minimizing ongoing risks during IMV.
