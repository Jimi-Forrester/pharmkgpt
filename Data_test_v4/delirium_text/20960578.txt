20960578|t|High-field MRI of single histological slices using an inductively coupled, self-resonant microcoil: application to ex vivo samples of patients with Alzheimer's disease.
20960578|a|A simple inductively coupled microcoil has been designed to image tissue samples placed on a microscope slide, samples which can subsequently be stained histologically. As the exact same tissue is used for MRI and histology, the two data sets can be compared without the need for complicated image registration techniques. The design can be integrated into any MRI system using existing commercial hardware. Compared with a commercial 25-mm-diameter birdcage, the signal-to-noise ratio was increased by a factor of 3.8, corresponding to an approximate 15-fold reduction in the data acquisition time. An example is shown of ex vivo samples from patients with Alzheimer's disease, in which the coregistration of highly sensitive iron staining and amyloid-beta deposits is confirmed.
