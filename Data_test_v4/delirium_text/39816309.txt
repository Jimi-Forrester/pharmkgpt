39816309|t|Hippocampal Sclerosis After Legionnaires' Disease: A Case Report.
39816309|a|Legionnaires' disease is a form of atypical pneumonia that can present with neurological symptoms, such as headaches, seizures, and focal neurological abnormalities. We report the case of a male patient who developed impaired consciousness and recurrent seizures following pneumonia caused by Legione lla. The patient received antibiotics and antiepileptic treatment and was discharged on hospital day 56. He was diagnosed with hippocampal sclerosis 10 months later. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of hippocampal sclerosis following Legionnaires' disease globally. Clinicians should be aware of the risk of hippocampal sclerosis after Legionnaires' disease.
