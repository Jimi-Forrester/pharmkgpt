32752587|a|The pandemic is unavoidable; in addition to increased morbidity and mortality, they profoundly affect people and economies at every level. The negative effects of pandemics are more severe in marginalized populations such as older adults who have higher risks of acquiring infection, more disease-related complications, and increased risks of death. Furthermore, older people are affected by policy decisions and containment measures taken during pandemics. With rapid patient turnover and overwhelmed health care facilities, this older population may not receive proper medical care. In addition to poor clinical outcomes, such measures have profound negative effects on the mental health of older populations.
