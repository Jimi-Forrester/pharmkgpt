340985|t|[Proposal for the introduction of a new substance into hospital practice: dipropyl acetate sodium in the prevention and treatment of alcoholic delirium].
340985|a|Reference is made to two years' work with the sodium salt of N-dipropylacetic acid in the prevention and treatment of alcoholic delirium tremens in 1500 subjects. The drug impeded the onset of the syndrome, or reduced its duration and gravity in cases where it was already present. It appeared suitable for the specific correction of the CNS functional changes responsible for delirium tremens.
