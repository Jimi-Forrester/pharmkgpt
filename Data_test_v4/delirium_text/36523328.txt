36523328|t|Amyloid management by chaperones: The mystery underlying protein oligomers' dual functions.
36523328|a|Protein oligomerization has two notable aspects: it is crucial for the performing cellular and molecular processes accurately, and it produces amyloid fibril precursors. Although a clear explanation for amyloidosis as a whole is lacking, most studies have emphasized the importance of protein misfolding followed by formation of cytotoxic oligomer structures, which are responsible for disorders as diverse as neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, and metabolic disorders, such as type 2 diabetes. Constant surveillance by oligomeric protein structures known as molecular chaperones enables cells to overcome the challenge of misfolded proteins and their harmful assemblies. These molecular chaperones encounter proteins in cells, and benefit cell survival as long as they perform correctly. Thus, this review highlights the roles of structural aspects of chaperone protein oligomers in determining cell fate-either succumbing to amyloid oligomers or survival-as well as experimental approaches used to investigate these entities.
