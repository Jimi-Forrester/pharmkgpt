33044179|t|Differences in Clinical Presentation of Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia in Alzheimer's Disease According to Sex and Education Level.
33044179|a|BACKGROUND: The behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) seriously affect the quality of life of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and their caregivers. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify associations between demographic/genetic factors and clinical presentations of BPSD. METHODS: In a cohort of 463 AD patients with BPSD, we retrospectively analyzed sex, education level, AD severity (assessed using the Clinical Dementia Rating and Mini-Mental Status Examination), and BPSD severity (assessed using the Neuropsychiatry Inventory, NPI). Severe BPSD was defined as NPI >=10 for 3 consecutive years. RESULTS: Among patients with severe BPSD (NPI >=10), we observed more female patients (62.96%) and a lower level of education (6.03+-4.77 years) as compared to those with mild BPSD (NPI <10) (female: 51.09%, p = 0.007; education years: 7.91+-4.93, p < 0.001). Females had a lower level of education (5.72+-4.50 years) and higher scores for depression/dysphoria (1.22+-2.05) compared with males (education: 8.96+-4.89 years, p < 0.001; depression/dysphoria: 0.78+-1.42, p = 0.047). Patients with a high level of education (defined as >=12 years) had higher scores for appetite/eating (0.90+-2.02) than did those without (0.69+-1.79; p = 0.001). Genetic analysis showed similar total and subscale NPI scores between patients with and without APOE4 and with and without the GRN rs5848 genotype. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate potential contributions of sex and education to the presentation of BPSD. Further study is warranted to provide models for tailoring therapeutic programs to individual AD patients according to these factors.
