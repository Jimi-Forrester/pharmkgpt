29133765|t|Geriatric Anesthesia-related Morbidity and Mortality in China: Current Status and Trend.
29133765|a|OBJECTIVE: The population of elderly patients and the amount of geriatric anesthesia have been growing rapidly in China. Thus, understanding the morbidity and mortality associated with geriatric anesthesia in China is critical to the improvement of anesthesia quality and outcome. The aim of the review was to discuss the geriatric anesthesia-related morbidity and mortality in China, as well as to point out the future trend. DATA SOURCES: Articles in this review were all searched from Wanfang, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), VIP, PubMed, and Web of Science databases, based on the reports originated in China from January 2011 to December 2016. STUDY SELECTION: A total of 57 studies were selected for further study, including 12 retrospective studies, 35 prospective studies, 3 meta-analyses, 4 reviews, 1 viewpoint, and 2 case reports. Of the total studies, 42 studies were in Chinese while 15 were in English. RESULTS: The mortality and morbidity associated with geriatric anesthesia in China are not yet completely reported. Some factors have been recognized, while some are yet to be identified and confirmed. Several studies addressed postoperative cognitive dysfunction and postoperative delirium, whereas only a few studies can be found on renal complications. Thus, a nationwide registry is essential for geriatric anesthesia-associated adverse outcomes. The mortality associated with geriatric anesthesia in China should be reported promptly. In the future, the perspective of geriatric anesthesia needs to be expanded into perioperative geriatric medicine to improve the perioperative management strategy based on the postoperative outcome-directed concept transformation. CONCLUSIONS: Anesthesiologists should evaluate the physiological and medical status and focus on the prevention of potential complications in the perioperative setting with the goal to enhance elderly patients' long-term well-being and survival quality.
