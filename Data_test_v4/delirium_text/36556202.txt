36556202|t|Cholesterol Management in Neurology: Time for Revised Strategies?
36556202|a|Statin therapy has been extensively evaluated and shown to reduce the incidence of new or recurrent vascular events, ischemic stroke included. As a consequence, each published guideline pushes for lower low-density cholesterol levels in the population at large, recommending increased statin doses and/or adding new cholesterol-lowering molecules. Neurologists find it sometimes difficult to apply these guidelines, having to confront situations such as (1) ischemic strokes, mainly cardioembolic ones, in patients with already low LDL-cholesterol levels; (2) myasthenic patients, whose lifespan has been extended by available treatment, and whose age and cholesterol levels put them at risk for ischemic stroke; (3) patients with myotonic dystrophy, whose disease often associates diabetes mellitus and heart conduction defects, and in whom blood cholesterol management is also not settled. As such, further trials are needed to address these issues.
