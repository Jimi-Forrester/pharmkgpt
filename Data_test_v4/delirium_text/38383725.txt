The whole, cortical, and subcortical volumes of previously enrolled 21 participants, under 11 years of age, with a SCN1A mutation, and 42 healthy controls, were obtained using a DLS method, and compared to volumes measured by Freesurfer with manual correction. Additionally, the volumes which were calculated with the DLS method between the patients and the control group. The volumes of total brain gray and white matter using DLS method were consistent with that volume which were measured by Freesurfer with manual correction in healthy controls. Among 68 cortical parcellated volume analysis, the volumes of only 7 areas measured by DLS methods were significantly different from that measured by Freesurfer with manual correction, and the differences decreased with increasing age in the subgroup analysis. The subcortical volume measured by the DLS method was relatively smaller than that of the Freesurfer volume analysis. Further, the DLS method could perfectly detect the reduced volume identified by the Freesurfer software and manual correction in patients with SCN1A mutations, compared with healthy controls. In a pediatric population, this new, fully automated DLS method is compatible with the classic, volumetric analysis with Freesurfer software and manual correction, and it can also well detect brain morphological changes in children with a neurodevelopmental disorder.
