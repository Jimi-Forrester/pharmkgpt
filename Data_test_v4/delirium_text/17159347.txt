17159347|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder resulting from multiple genetic and non-genetic factors. Linkage studies indicated that chromosome 10 has at least one locus for this disease. The cell division cycle 2 (CDC2) gene, which is close to one of the linkage regions, has previously been associated with the risk of AD with an odds ratio of 1.78. Biologically, CDC2, which is involved in paired helical filament-tau formation, is thought as a candidate gene in AD. METHODS: In this study, six single nucleotide polymorphisms spanning the entire gene were selected and examined for association for late-onset AD (LOAD) in two large independent datasets. A family-based dataset including 1,337 Caucasian discordant sib pairs and an independent dataset of 745 Caucasian cases and 998 controls for LOAD were used. Family-based association tests and logistic regression conditional on the apolipoprotein E genotype and sex were applied to association study in family-based and case-control datasets, respectively. RESULTS: Neither dataset demonstrated any association with LOAD in our samples with all p values >0.16. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that if any contribution of common genetic variants in CDC2 to the risk of developing AD exists, it is likely to be very small.
