34838941|a|NLRP3 inflammasome is a critical immune component that plays a crucial role in mounting innate immune responses. The deleterious effects of inflammasome activation have been correlated with the COVID-19 disease severity. In the presence of several underlying disorders, the immune components of our bodies are dysregulated, creating conditions that could adversely affect us other than providing a required level of protection. In this review, we focused on the occurrence of NLRP3 inflammasome activation in response to SARS-COV-2 infection, dysregulation of NLRP3 activation events in the presence of several comorbidities, the contribution of activated NLRP3 inflammasome to the severity of COVID-19, and available therapeutics for the treatment of such NLRP3 inflammasome related diseases based on current knowledge. The primed state of immunity in individuals with comorbidities (risk factors) could accelerate many deaths and severe COVID-19 cases via activation of NLRP3 inflammasome and the release of downstream inflammatory molecules. Therefore, a detailed understanding of the host-pathogen interaction is needed to clarify the pathophysiology and select a potential therapeutic approach.
