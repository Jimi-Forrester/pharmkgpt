36764636|a|Epigenomic modifications of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene have been postulated to underlie the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental, psychiatric, and neurological conditions. This systematic review summarizes current evidence investigating the association of BDNF epigenomic modifications (DNA methylation, non-coding RNA, histone modifications) with brain-related phenotypes in humans. A novel contribution is our creation of an open access web-based application, the BDNF DNA Methylation Map, to interactively visualize specific positions of CpG sites investigated across all studies for which relevant data were available. Our literature search of four databases through September 27, 2021 returned 1701 articles, of which 153 met inclusion criteria. Our review revealed exceptional heterogeneity in methodological approaches, hindering the identification of clear patterns of robust and/or replicated results. We summarize key findings and provide recommendations for future epigenomic research. The existing literature appears to remain in its infancy and requires additional rigorous research to fulfill its potential to explain BDNF-linked risk for brain-related conditions and improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying their pathogenesis.
