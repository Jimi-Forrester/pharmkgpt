38995774|t|The Use of Event Related Potentials to Predict Amyloid PET Status Among Patients from a Memory Disorders Clinic.
38995774|a|Background: Amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) scans provide in vivo evidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, their high cost limits their use in standard clinical care. Event related potentials (ERPs) may represent an inexpensive and non-invasive additional method for detecting AD pathology. Objective: We investigated whether ERPs, along with neuropsychological data, serve as predictors of amyloid PET status in patients with memory complaints. Methods: Veterans aged 50-100 were recruited from a memory disorders clinic. Participants underwent a neuropsychological battery and an ERP auditory oddball protocol. Twenty-eight patients had a positive amyloid PET scan, and thirty-nine patients had a negative scan. Results: ERP-P200 target amplitude and P200 standard latency were predictors of amyloid PET status. When submitting to ROC analysis, P200 standard latency exhibited the highest specificity and sensitivity in predicting amyloid PET positivity, correctly classifying the amyloid PET status for 86% of patients. Conclusions: ERP-P200 measures are strong indicators of amyloid-beta presence in patients from a memory disorder clinic. Increased P200 amplitude and decreased P200 latency in patients with a positive amyloid PET scan may be attributed to hyperactivation of perceptual bottom-up processes compensating for AD-related synaptic loss in the fronto-parietal networks.
