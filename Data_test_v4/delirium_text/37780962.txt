37780962|t|Conceptualizing healthy cognitive aging: the role of time and variability.
37780962|a|The interest in healthy cognitive aging (HCA) has increased substantially over the past decade. Researchers are interested in exploring how health can be promoted and cognitive decline mitigated when pathology is not present. Identifying the necessary strategies is crucial as the gradual accumulation of small declines can lead to negative effects on quality of life over time. However, the conceptualization of HCA is not agreed upon. In fact, authors often turn to the use of traditional pathology screeners in the context of HCA because of their clear threshold results and their wide use in the different fields. This leads to the assumption that individuals are either cognitively unhealthy and therefore may have some form of dementia or are dementia-free and cognitively healthy. We believe that this view is an overly simplistic approach to the understanding of the aging process. In this work, we explore how HCA has been defined and conceptualized within the different fields. We further discuss how time and variability are key concepts that are often missing when studying HCA and propose a definition that aims to unify the findings from the multidisciplinary research that studies HCA and simplify the translation of knowledge. Incorporating these two novel dimensions to the study of HCA has already been proposed methodologically but has yet been discussed at the conceptual level. We believe that the proposed new approach will allow the identification of individual factors that cause changes in cognitive health and will help build new cognitive health strategies and mitigate further declines.
