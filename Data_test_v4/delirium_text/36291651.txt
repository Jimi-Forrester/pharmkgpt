36291651|t|Introduction to Traditional Medicine and Their Role in Prevention and Treatment of Emerging and Re-Emerging Diseases.
36291651|a|Infectious diseases have been a threat to human health globally. The relentless efforts and research have enabled us to overcome most of the diseases through the use of antiviral and antibiotic agents discovered and employed. Unfortunately, the microorganisms have the capability to adapt and mutate over time and antibiotic and antiviral resistance ensues. There are many challenges in treating infections such as failure of the microorganisms to respond to the therapeutic agents, which has led to more chronic infections, complications, and preventable loss of life. Thus, a multidisciplinary approach and collaboration is warranted to create more potent, effective, and versatile therapies to prevent and eradicate the old and newly emerging diseases. In the recent past, natural medicine has proven its effectiveness against various illnesses. Most of the pharmaceutical agents currently used can trace their origin to the natural products in one way, shape, or form. The full potential of natural products is yet to be realized, as numerous natural resources have not been explored and analyzed. This merits continuous support in research and analysis of ancient treatment systems to explore their full potential and employ them as an alternative or principal therapy.
