34813582|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Incorporation of Lean into health care requires consideration of the patient and other customer experience of care as well as final health outcomes. We incorporate experience-based design (EBD) into our Lean management method to assess the experience of care, guide redesign of care processes, and assess the effectiveness of quality improvement on the care experience. Foundational to EBD is identification of "touch points," moments in the health care delivery process where a patient has a strong positive or negative emotional response that has the potential to alter the way patients feel about their overall care experience. METHODS: EBD proceeds sequentially from qualitative assessment of customer experience and touch points (through observations and interviews); semiquantitatively assessing the experience across many patients (through EBD questionnaires); engaging in codesign with patients (through improvement teams and events); and reassessing the care experience after improvement (through follow-up EBD questionnaires). The use of project-specific (EBD) emotion word questionnaires enables assessment of change over time. These EBD questionnaires are developed ad hoc for each care improvement effort, to reflect the specific high emotion touch points patients identify for that care process, and therefore pose unique validity and reliability challenges. We have previously validated a set of emotion words that form the library from which questionnaire designers select the relevant emotion word choices. In addition, to assess consistency of measurement in the absence of any improvement, we performed a repeated-measures study deploying the same EBD questionnaire to different groups of patients, separated by a 60-day interval in the absence of any quality improvement work. RESULTS: We apply EBD across the health care enterprise, including patients and family caregivers, as well as staff members. Examples where EBD has been incorporated into care redesign have included; outpatient care for pancreatic cancer patients; clinic visits in rheumatology; delirium care for hospital inpatients; and the orientation process for newly hired advanced practice providers. Our reliability data demonstrate that moderate differences in scores on the EBD questionnaire (up to 19 percentage points) may reflect random variability, but differences of greater magnitude reflect actual changes in the patient experience. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, experience-based design has promise as a methodology to incorporate patient experience within a Lean management structure. EBD can aid with health care redesign, defining the emotional touch points that are foundational to the experience of care, enabling targeting of quality improvement efforts, and assessing change.
