38912281|t|Sleep Basic Research on Verifying the Effects of Natural Compounds on Wakefulness or Sleep.
38912281|a|I studied at the Sleep and Circadian Neurobiology Laboratory, Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Stanford University School of Medicine, from April 2018 to March 2020. At Stanford University, I mainly researched the following themes: (1) sleep basic research using mice (administering compounds with sleep or wakefulness effects to mice and examining their effects), and (2) research on circadian rhythm disorders. There are only a few institutions in the world that can conduct sleep basic research using mice, and Stanford University is a wonderful environment to immerse yourself in research, as it is home to not only psychiatrists but also neurologists and many basic researchers. In this article, I would like to review the experiments I conducted during my study abroad, using mice to verify the effects of natural compounds on wakefulness or sleep. In one study, we evaluated the effects of ginkgolides (A, B, and C) and bilobalide on arousal, locomotion, and core body temperature. The results showed that only ginkgolide B dose-dependently increased the amount of arousal and decreased the amount of NREM sleep in the physiological sleep-wake cycle of mice. In another study, we tested the sleep-inducing effects of sake yeast in mice under an acute insomnia model. We showed that sake yeast dose-dependently increased REM and non-REM sleep, decreased arousal within 6 hours after oral administration of sake yeast, and decreased locomotion and core body temperature in a new cage.
