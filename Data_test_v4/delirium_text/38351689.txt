38351689|a|The potential of nanotechnology in advancing the diagnosis and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases is explored in this comprehensive literature review. Through an examination of various studies that utilize nanotechnology models. The aim of this paper is to evaluate whether these models can be considered a significant breakthrough in the field of neurodegeneration. The findings of these studies suggest that nanotechnology has the capacity to improve existing therapeutic approaches, create novel and safe compounds, and develop more precise imaging techniques and diagnostic methods for neurodegenerative diseases. With the emergence of the nanomedicine era, a new and innovative approach to diagnosing and treating these conditions has been introduced. Notably, the researchers' development of a nanocarrier drug delivery tool demonstrates immense potential compared to conventional therapy, as it maximizes therapeutic efficacy and minimizes undesirable side effects.
