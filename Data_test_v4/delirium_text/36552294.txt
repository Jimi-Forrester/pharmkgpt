36552294|t|Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone: Biology and Therapeutic Opportunities.
36552294|a|In 1981, Wylie Vale, Joachim Spiess, Catherine Rivier, and Jean Rivier reported on the characterization of a 41-amino-acid peptide from ovine hypothalamic extracts with high potency and intrinsic activity stimulating the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone and beta-endorphin by cultured anterior pituitary cells. With its sequence known, this neuropeptide was determined to be a hormone and consequently named corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), although the term corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) is still used and preferred in some circumstances. Several decades have passed since this seminal contribution that opened a new research era, expanding the understanding of the coding of stress-related processes. The characterization of CRH receptors, the availability of CRH agonists and antagonists, and advanced immunocytochemical staining techniques have provided evidence that CRH plays a role in the regulation of several biological systems. The purpose of this review is to summarize the present knowledge of this 41-amino-acid peptide.
