38792558|t|The Surgical Stress Response and Anesthesia: A Narrative Review.
38792558|a|The human physiological response "to stress" includes all metabolic and hormonal changes produced by a traumatic event at the micro or macro cellular levels. The main goal of the body's first response to trauma is to keep physiological homeostasis. The perioperative non-specific adaptation response can sometimes be detrimental and can produce systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), characterized by hypermetabolism and hyper catabolism. We performed a narrative review consisting of a description of the surgical stress response's categories of changes (neurohormonal and immunological response) followed by reviewing methods found in published studies to modulate the surgical stress response perioperatively. We described various preoperative measures cited in the literature as lowering the burden of surgical trauma. This article revises the anesthetic drugs and techniques that have an impact on the surgical stress response and proven immune-modulatory effects. We also tried to name present knowledge gaps requiring future research. Our review concludes that proper preoperative measures, adequate general anesthetics, multimodal analgesia, early postoperative mobilization, and early enteral nutrition can decrease the stress response to surgery and ease patient recovery. Anesthetics and analgesics used during the perioperative period may modulate the innate and adaptive immune system and inflammatory system, with a consecutive impact on cancer recurrence and long-term outcomes.
