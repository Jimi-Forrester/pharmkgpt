37796532|a|PURPOSE: To explore the incidence, risk factors, management and prognosis of systemic complications after ophthalmic surgeries. METHODS: A retrospective review of hospitalized patients undergoing ophthalmic surgeries between 2012 and 2022 at Peking Union Medical College Hospital was performed to summarize and analyse the postoperative systemic complications. Multivariate logistic and linear regression analyses were conducted to clarify the risk factors of postoperative systemic complications and factors associated with the severity of adverse events. RESULTS: A total of 34,841 patients underwent inpatient ophthalmic surgery, among which 162 systemic complications occurred in 150 patients during postoperative hospitalization. The overall incidence rate was 0.4%, with cardiovascular events (48.1%), digestive events (13.6%) and fever (12.3%) being the leading causes. About 17.3% of the cases had conditions improved after observation, 19.1% after symptomatic treatment, 54.9% had consultation with specific intervention and 8.6% were transferred to the corresponding departments for specialized treatment. For the prognosis, 93.8% had condition improved, 5.6% chose voluntary discharge without improvement, and one patient died of respiratory failure caused by postoperative pulmonary infection. The worse ADL (activities of daily living) grading, indication of primary intraocular lymphoma or intraocular tumour, surgery of simple pars plana vitrectomy (PPV), PPV with silicone oil tamponade, PPV with gas tamponade, general anaesthesia, history of diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic heart failure and digestive system disease were the risk factors positively correlated with postoperative systemic complications (p < .05). The worse ADL grading, history of DM and respiratory system disease were also positively correlated with the severity of the adverse events (p < .05). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of postoperative systemic complications was low among patients undergoing ophthalmic surgery, most were mild and could be relieved after observation, symptomatic or specialist consultation. Patients with worse ADL and history of DM should be paid extra attention.
