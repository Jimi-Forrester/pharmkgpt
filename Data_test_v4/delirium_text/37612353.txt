37612353|t|Cocaine hydrochloride, cocaine methiodide and methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV) cause distinct alterations in the structure and composition of the gut microbiota.
37612353|a|Cocaine is a highly addictive psychostimulant drug of abuse that constitutes an ongoing public health threat. Emerging research is revealing that numerous peripheral effects of this drug may serve as conditioned stimuli for its central reinforcing properties. The gut microbiota is emerging as one of these peripheral sources of input to cocaine reward. The primary objective of the present study was to determine how cocaine HCl and methylenedioxypyrovalerone, both of which powerfully activate central reward pathways, alter the gut microbiota. Cocaine methiodide, a quaternary derivative of cocaine that does not enter the brain, was included to assess peripheral influences on the gut microbiota. Both cocaine congeners caused significant and similar alterations of the gut microbiota after a 10-day course of treatment. Contrary to expectations, the effects of cocaine HCl and MDPV on the gut microbiota were most dissimilar. Functional predictions of metabolic alterations caused by the treatment drugs reaffirmed that the cocaine congeners were similar whereas MDPV was most dissimilar from the other two drugs and controls. It appears that the monoamine transporters in the gut mediate the effects of the treatment drugs. The effects of the cocaine congeners and MDPV on the gut microbiome may form the basis of interoceptive cues that can influence their abuse properties.
