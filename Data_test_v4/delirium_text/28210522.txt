28210522|a|Although psychiatric manifestations in the form of delirium, confusional states, and psychosis have been commonly reported in relation to hypoglycemia, association of hyperglycemia with psychiatric manifestations has been less commonly reported. In this case report, we present the case of a 36-year-old woman suffering from Type 1 diabetes mellitus who developed recurrent episodes of psychosis following poor adherence to her insulin therapy, leading to significantly high levels of blood glucose. Adequate control of blood glucose levels by improving the adherence with insulin led to lack of recurrence of psychosis.
