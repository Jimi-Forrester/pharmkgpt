16683538|t|[The progress in proteomics researches of Alzheimer's disease].
16683538|a|Proteomics, an important discipline in genomic era, is the integrated study of protein properties on a large scale. Application of proteomics researches in Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is one of the most common and complex neurodegeneration disorders, we can not only elucidate the essential issues of disease in protein level, but give a whole view in the pathological mechanisms identification, diagnosis and therapeutic targets discovery as well. The three aspects about the progresses in proteomics researches of AD were reviewed in this article.
