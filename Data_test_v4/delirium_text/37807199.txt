37807199|t|A - 54 Interdisciplinary Assessment in the Differential Diagnosis of the Phenocopy Syndrome of Behavioral Variant Frontotemporal Dementia: a Case Study.
37807199|a|OBJECTIVE: Phenocopy syndrome of behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (phFTD) is a clinical syndrome in which the neuropsychiatric criteria of behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) are fulfilled without demonstration of classic bvFTD neuroimaging abnormalities or clinical progression. We present a case of an individual with atypical bvFTD that was initially characterized as phFTD and discuss clinical considerations for complicated differential diagnosis in a phenocopy syndrome that is still not fully understood. METHOD: A 77-year-old male presented to a neurology clinic for a third opinion due to behavior changes, with progressive course, reported by family since 2019. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan indicated nonspecific volume loss and mild chronic white matter ischemic changes. Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scan indicated bilateral temporoparietal hypometabolism. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker study was not consistent with pathological changes of Alzheimer's disease. C9orf72 and other FTD-associated gene mutations were negative. RESULTS: Neuropsychological test results were grossly normal across two separate evaluations between 2021-2022. A third evaluation in 2023 showed significant executive deficits, including below average to exceptionally low divided attention and set shifting, novel problem solving, and phonemic fluency. CONCLUSION: This case underscores the complexity of differentiating between phFTD and bvFTD and highlights the need for interdisciplinary evaluation, including serial neuropsychological assessment. Additionally, it suggests that, in some cases, phFTD may represent prodromal bvFTD. Further research is needed to better understand the underlying mechanisms of phFTD and its relationship to FTD, as well as to develop more effective diagnostic tools and treatments for this challenging clinical syndrome.
