38977984|a|BACKGROUND: Delirium is a common disorder affecting patients' psychiatric illness, characterized by a high rate of underdiagnosis, misdiagnosis, and high risks. However, previous studies frequently excluded patients with psychiatric illness, leading to limited knowledge about risk factors and optimal assessment tools for delirium in psychiatric settings. OBJECTIVES: The scoping review was carried out to (1) identify the risk factors associated with delirium in patients with psychiatric illness; (2) synthesize the performance of assessment tools for detecting delirium in patients with psychiatric illness in psychiatric settings. DESIGN: Scoping review. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase were searched to identify primary studies on delirium in psychiatric settings from inception to Dec 2023 inclusive. Two independent reviewers screened eligible studies against inclusion criteria. A narrative synthesis of the included studies was conducted. RESULTS: A final set of 36 articles meeting the inclusion criteria, two main themes were extracted: risk factors associated with delirium in patients with psychiatric illness and assessment tools for detecting delirium in psychiatric settings. The risk factors associated with delirium primarily included advanced age, physical comorbid, types of psychiatric illness, antipsychotics, anticholinergic drug, Electroconvulsive therapy, and the combination of lithium and Electroconvulsive therapy. Delirium Rating Scale-Revised-98, Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale, and Delirium Diagnostic Tool-Provisional might be valuable for delirium assessment in patients with psychiatric illness in psychiatric settings. CONCLUSIONS: Delirium diagnosis in psychiatric settings is complex due to the overlapping clinical manifestations between psychiatric illness and delirium, as well as their potential co-occurrence. It is imperative to understand the risk factors and assessment methods related to delirium in this population to address diagnostic delays, establish effective prevention and screening strategies. Future research should focus on designing, implementing, and evaluating interventions that target modifiable risk factors, to prevent and manage delirium in patients with psychiatric illness.
