31958419|t|Parkin overexpression attenuates Abeta-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in HEK293 cells by restoring impaired mitophagy.
31958419|a|AIMS: Mitochondrial dysfunction is an early prominent feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the present study, we sought to investigate whether defective mitophagy is tightly related to amyloid-beta (Abeta)-induced mitochondrial dysfunction. MAIN METHODS: Immunofluorescence, western blot and transmission electron microscopy were used to examine mitophagy. Mitochondrial membrane potential was assessed using the JC-1 dye. Mitochondrial ROS was detected using MitoSOX  Red staining. KEY FINDINGS: Abeta induced mitochondrial dysfunction in HEK293 cells. Moreover, Abeta induced an increase in parkin translocation to mitochondria and led to a drastic reduction in cytosolic parkin. Furthermore, Abeta-treated cells displayed a microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) punctate pattern and elevated mitochondrial LC3-II levels, suggesting the upregulation of mitophagy. Notably, Abeta induced the accumulation of mitochondrial p62, which was associated with impaired mitophagy. In addition, Abeta-treated cells exhibited fragmented or swollen mitochondria with severely decreased cristae. We then investigated whether overexpression of parkin could protect cells against Abeta-induced mitochondrial dysfunction. Interestingly, parkin overexpression inhibited Abeta-induced mitochondrial dysfunction. Besides, parkin overexpression increased cytosolic and mitochondrial parkin levels as well as mitochondrial LC3-II levels in Abeta-treated cells. Additionally, parkin overexpression reversed the accumulation of p62 in mitochondria, indicating that parkin overexpression restored impaired mitophagy in Abeta-treated cells. Importantly, parkin overexpression remarkably reversed Abeta-induced mitochondrial fragmentation. SIGNIFICANCE: Our data demonstrate that overexpression of parkin ameliorates impaired mitophagy and promotes the removal of damaged mitochondria in Abeta-treated cells, indicating that upregulation of parkin-mediated mitophagy may be a potential strategy for the therapy of AD.
