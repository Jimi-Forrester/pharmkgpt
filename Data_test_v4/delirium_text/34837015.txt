34837015|t|O-GlcNAcylation in health and neurodegenerative diseases.
34837015|a|O-GlcNAcylation is a posttranslational modification that adds O-linked beta-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) to serine or threonine residues of many proteins. This protein modification interacts with key cellular pathways involved in transcription, translation, and proteostasis. Although ubiquitous throughout the body, O-GlcNAc is particularly abundant in the brain, and various proteins commonly found at synapses are O-GlcNAcylated. Recent studies have demonstrated that the modulation of O-GlcNAc in the brain alters synaptic and neuronal functions. Furthermore, altered brain O-GlcNAcylation is associated with either the etiology or pathology of numerous neurodegenerative diseases, while the manipulation of O-GlcNAc exerts neuroprotective effects against these diseases. Although the detailed molecular mechanisms underlying the functional roles of O-GlcNAcylation in the brain remain unclear, O-GlcNAcylation is critical for regulating diverse neural functions, and its levels change during normal and pathological aging. In this review, we will highlight the functional importance of O-GlcNAcylation in the brain and neurodegenerative diseases.
