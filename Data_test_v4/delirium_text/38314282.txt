38314282|a|Background: Ventilator weaning is a process of discontinuing mechanical ventilation and transitioning patients to independent breathing after a period of mechanical support. Weaning outcomes among the critically ill in intensive care units (ICUs) vary significantly among individuals, leading to considerable variation in healthcare costs, length of hospital stay, morbidity and mortality. Addressing psychosocial aspects of care can improve weaning outcomes. Objective: This study aimed to determine the effect of psychosocial factors (social support, family/significant other support, ability to communicate) on weaning outcome within intensive care patients. This research hypothesized that psychological and social factors play a role in determining ventilator weaning outcomes among ICU patients. Methods: This study used a longitudinal, retrospective research design to analyze positive and negative psychosocial predictors of ventilator weaning outcomes. Data collection methods include interviews and questionnaires with patients and their families, as well as clinical data from the patient's medical records. Results: presence of anxiety, depression, and hallucinations, have a negative relationship with weaning outcomes regarding a patient's psychological characteristics (rs = -0.207, -0.163, -0.158), while communication with a patient during mechanical ventilation have a positive relationship with weaning outcomes regarding a patient's psychological characteristics (rs = 0.152; p <= 0.05). Moreover patients who have fear during weaning trials, feeling neglected, and feeling insecurity have a negative relationship with weaning outcomes while gaining family support during mechanical ventilation have a positive relationship with weaning outcomes (rs = 0.144; p <= 0.05).Significance of results, the findings suggests that psychosocial factors, such as anxiety, depression, patient's perception of their illness, motivation to wean, and family involvement can influence the success of ventilator weaning among patients in ICUs.
