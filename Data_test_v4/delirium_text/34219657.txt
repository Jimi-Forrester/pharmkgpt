34219657|a|BACKGROUND: Delirium affects many patients undergoing stem cell transplantation (SCT). Delirium is treatable, but prevention is a better goal, making it desirable to identify patients at heightened risk for delirium. A standardized pretransplant psychosocial assessment rating scale, the Stanford Integrated Psychosocial Assessment for Transplantation (SIPAT), has been demonstrated to predict outcomes in solid organ transplant recipients and nonadherence in patients with SCT. OBJECTIVES: In this study, we aimed to evaluate the association of SIPAT score and post-SCT incident delirium. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed records of SCT recipients who had SIPAT evaluations before SCT, for indications of delirium in the 6 months after transplant. We tested the association between SIPAT score and delirium by logistic regression, controlling for relevant covariates such as transplant type (allogeneic vs autologous). RESULTS: Of 85 patients (median age of 49 years, range 18-74), 56 (66%) were men, and 43 (50.5%) were autologous SCT recipients. The median pretransplant SIPAT score was 8, range 0-40. There were 15 cases (17.6%) of delirium in the 6 months following transplant.  In univariate analyses, transplant type was significantly associated with incident delirium. In multivariate analyses, SIPAT score was significantly associated with incident delirium (odds ratio, 1.090; P = 0.021). CONCLUSIONS: Psychosocial risk as quantified by the SIPAT is associated with development of delirium in SCT recipients. This scale can therefore be integrated into medical risk models to anticipate which patients are at higher risk for delirium in their hospital course, enabling preventative measures tailored to the needs of the individual patient.
