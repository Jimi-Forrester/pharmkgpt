33271431|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex and heterogeneous neurodegenerative disease. A wide range of techniques have been proposed to facilitate early diagnosis of AD, including biomarkers from the cerebrospinal fluid and blood. Although phosphorylated tau and amyloid beta are amongst the most promising biomarkers of AD, other peripheral biomarkers have been identified and in this review we synthesize the current knowledge on circulating fatty acids. Fatty acids are involved in different biological process including neurotransmission and inflammation. Interestingly, some fatty acids appear to be modulated during disease progression, including long chain saturated fatty acids, and polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as docosahexaenoic acid . However, discrepant results have been reported in the literature and there is the need for further validation and method standardization. Nonetheless, our literature review suggests that fatty acid analyses could potentially provide a valuable source of data to further inform the pathology and progression of AD.
