36245347|t|Current evidence of ultrasound-guided fascial plane blocks for cardiac surgery: a narrative literature review.
36245347|a|Fascial plane blocks are useful for multimodal analgesia after cardiac surgery since they can provide effective analgesia without the serious risks associated with conventional techniques such as neuraxial hematoma and pneumothorax. This narrative review covers blocks performed at the parasternal intercostal, interpectoral, pectoserratus, serratus anterior, erector spinae, and retrolaminar planes, which are targets for fascial plane blocks in cardiac surgery. Brief anatomical considerations, mechanisms, and currently available evidence are reviewed. Additionally, recent evidence on fascial plane blocks for subcutaneous-implantable cardioverter-defibrillator implantation are also reviewed.
