10881252|t|Differentiating frontal and temporal variant frontotemporal dementia from Alzheimer's disease.
10881252|a|OBJECTIVE/BACKGROUND: To determine whether difficulty in the early differentiation between frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and AD may arise from a failure to discriminate between the temporal and frontal variants of FTD. METHODS: Neuropsychological profiles of patients with early dementia of Alzheimer type (DAT; n = 10), the temporal variant of FTD (tv-FTD or semantic dementia; n = 5), and the frontal variant of FTD (fv-FTD; n = 10) were compared to each other and normal controls (n = 10). Structural MRI demonstrated temporal lobe atrophy in the tv-FTD patients and frontal lobe atrophy in the fv-FTD group. RESULTS: Subjects with tv-FTD showed severe deficits in semantic memory with preservation of attention and executive function. Subjects with fv-FTD showed the reverse pattern. Attention and executive function impairment separated the fv-FTD patients from the early DAT subjects, who were densely amnesic. CONCLUSION: The double dissociation in performance on semantic memory and attention/executive function clearly separated the temporal and frontal variants of FTD and aids the early differentiation of FTD from AD. The characteristic cognitive profiles reflect the distribution of pathology within each syndrome and support the putative role of the inferolateral temporal neocortex in semantic memory, the medial temporal lobe structures of the hippocampal complex in episodic memory, and the frontal lobes in executive function.
