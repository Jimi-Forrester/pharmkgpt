36320795|t|A Systematic Review of Randomized Controlled Trials on Virtual Reality Application in Pediatric Patients.
36320795|a|Virtual reality is a novel approach for distracting and alleviating anxiety, pain, and other complications during medical procedures, and it can be more effective than conventional methods. In virtual reality, the patient is completely immersed in the virtual environment, which is used to make patients feel more comfortable and can provide a positive prognosis. The data were searched by using the Boolean operator "AND" between the search phrases "Virtual reality," and "Pediatrics" and the relevant literature was extracted. The inclusion criteria were the free full text, randomized controlled trials, studies between 2016 and 2022 and pediatric patients. This systematic review was conducted to compare randomized controlled trials of virtual reality applications in pediatric patients in different clinical settings. Of the included 15 randomized controlled trials, 12 studies were on pain and anxiety, two on brain injury and cerebral palsy, and one on awareness among asthmatic patients. This review concluded that virtual reality exposure has a beneficial effect on pediatric patients in reducing pain and anxiety, improving muscle strength and dexterity, and awareness among asthmatic patients.
