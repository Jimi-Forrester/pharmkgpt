34674495|t|Long-term prognostic value of functional status and delirium in emergency patients with decompensated heart failure.
34674495|a|AIMS: Heart failure (HF) is prevalent in older adults and is associated with impaired physical and cognitive function. However, these factors are rarely included in studies about long-term prognosis of HF. The aim of the study was to determine whether functional status and delirium at admission (prevalent delirium) would predict 1-year mortality in patients with decompensated HF (DHF). METHODS: We performed a prospective observational study in adult patients with DHF attended at two Spanish Emergency Departments (ED) in the context of the Epidemiology Acute HF Emergency project. Functional status was assessed by Barthel Index (BI) and prevalent delirium by the Brief Confusion Assessment Method within the first 24 h of admission. We used Kaplan-Meier survival curves for delirium and multivariable Cox regression models to estimated hazard ratio (HR) and survival probability for death while adjusting for six potential confounders. RESULT: We enrolled 239 patients (age 81.7 +- 9.4 years, women 61.1%). BI < 60 was 23.4 and 14.6% of patients had delirium. Age (HR 1.046 CI 95% 1.014-1.080, p < 0.004) and BI (HR 0.979 CI 95% 0.972-0.979, p < 0.001) were independently associated with 1-year mortality. In patients without severe functional dependence at admission, delirium (HR 3.579 CI 95% 1.730-7.403, p < 0.001) and age (HR 1.051 CI 95% 1.014-1.090, p = 0.007) independently predicted long-term mortality. CONCLUSION: Age and functional dependence are strong predictors of long-term mortality in patients with DHF. In patients without severe functional dependence, delirium-a potentially modifiable risk factor-identified a subgroup of patients with higher mortality. Evaluating functional status and delirium in ED could improve decision-making and future care of patients with DHF.
