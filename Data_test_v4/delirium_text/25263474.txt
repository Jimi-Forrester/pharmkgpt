25263474|a|INTRODUCTION: Surgical procedures in elderly patients are associated with a higher risk of complications. The main goal of this study was to evaluate the results and complications of urological surgeries in elderly patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective study was completed, evaluating the perioperative and early postoperative complications in patients over the age of 75. In total, 221 patients that underwent urological surgery between January 2011 and December 2012 were evaluated. The mean age of the patients was 78. RESULTS: The patient cohort that was evaluated experienced 48 (22%) complications; one death (<0.5%) and 4 (<2%) underwent repeat surgery due to serious complications. Infection was the most common complication: sepsis or surgical site infection. Other complications included respiratory insufficiency, delirium, bleeding etc. CONCLUSION: Urological surgery in patients above the age of 75 is safe, provided all pre-op procedures are executed correctly and prevention of possible complications is dealt with appropriately. Based on our results, the risk of complications falls within an acceptable range.
