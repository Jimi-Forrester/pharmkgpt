37725593|a|PURPOSE: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common aggressive primary malignant brain tumor in adults with a median age of onset of 68-70 years old. Although advanced age is often associated with poorer GBM patient survival, the predominant source(s) of maladaptive aging effects remains to be established. Here we studied intratumoral and extratumoral relationships between adult GBM patients and mice with brain tumors across the lifespan. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Electronic health records at Northwestern Medicine and the NCI SEER databases were evaluated for GBM patient age and overall survival. The commercial Tempus and Caris databases, as well as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were profiled for gene expression, DNA methylation, and mutational changes with varying GBM patient age. Additionally, gene expression analysis was performed on the extratumoral brain of younger and older adult mice with or without a brain tumor. The survival of young and old wild-type or transgenic (INK-ATTAC) mice with a brain tumor was evaluated after treatment with or without senolytics and/or immunotherapy. RESULTS: Human GBM patients >=65 years of age had a significantly decreased survival compared to their younger counterparts. While the intra-GBM molecular profiles were similar between younger and older GBM patients, non-tumor brain tissue had a significantly different gene expression profile between young and old mice with a brain tumor and the eradication of senescent cells improved immunotherapy-dependent survival of old but not young mice. CONCLUSIONS: This work suggests a potential benefit for combining senolytics with immunotherapy in older patients with GBM.
