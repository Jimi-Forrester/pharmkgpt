36993245|t|TREM2 and APOE do not modulate phagocytic clearance of dying cells in the live mammalian brain.
36993245|a|TREM2 and APOE are two major risk factors for Alzheimera$ s disease (AD) that have been proposed to play crucial roles in microglia pathophysiology by affecting their ability to phagocytose cellular debris or aggregated proteins. In this study, we investigated for the first time the impact of TREM2 and APOE on the removal of dying neurons in the live brain by implementing a targeted photochemical method for programmed cell death induction combined with high-resolution two-photon imaging. Our findings showed that the deletion of either TREM2 or APOE did not affect the dynamics of microglia engagement with dying neurons or their efficiency in phagocytosing corpses. Interestingly, while microglia that encapsulate amyloid deposits were capable of phagocytosing dying cells without disengaging from plaques or moving their cell bodies; in the absence of TREM2, microglia cell bodies were observed to readily migrate towards dying cells, further disengaging from plaques. Our data suggest that TREM2 and APOE variants are unlikely to increase risk of AD through impaired corpse phagocytosis. Summary: High-resolution two-photon imaging of programmed cell death in the live mouse brain reveals that neither TREM2 nor APOE modulate microglia phagocytosis of neuronal corpses. However, TREM2 regulates microglia migratory behavior towards dying cells in the vicinity of amyloid plaques.
