34319910|a|In recent years, the number of patients with neurodegenerative illness such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) has increased with the aging of the population. In this study, we evaluated the effect of Grape skin extract (GSE) on neurotypic SH-SY5Y cells as an in vitro AD model, murine neurospheres as an ex vivo neurogenesis model and SAMP8 mice as an in vivo AD model. Our in vitro result showed that pre-treatment of SH-SY5Y cells with GSE ameliorated Abeta-induced cytotoxicity. Moreover, GSE treatment significantly decreased the number of neurospheres, but increased their size suggesting reduced stem cell self-renewal but increased proliferation. Our in vivo Morris water maze test indicated that GSE improves learning and memory in SAMP8 mice. To detect proliferation and newborn neurons, we measured BrdU+ cells in the dentate gyrus (DG). GSE treatment increased the number of BrdU+ cells in the DG of SAMP8 mice. Finally, we showed that GSE induced a decrease in inflammatory cytokines and an increase in neurotransmitters in the cerebral cortex of SAMP8 mice. These results suggested that GSE increased neurogenic zone proliferation and memory but decreased oxidative stress associated with pro-inflammatory cytokines in aging, thus protecting neurons.
