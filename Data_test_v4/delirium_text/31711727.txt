31711727|t|Renal function and delirium in older fracture patients: different information from different formulas?
31711727|a|OBJECTIVES: the association between renal function and delirium has not been investigated in older fracture patients. Creatinine is frequently low in these subjects, which may influence the association between delirium and renal function as estimated with creatinine-based formulas. Cystatin C could be a more reliable filtration marker in these patients. AIM: to confirm the association between renal function and delirium in older fracture patients comparing creatinine- and cystatin-based estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) METHODS: patients aged 65+ requiring surgery for traumatic bone fractures were included. Six equations were used to calculate eGFR, based on serum creatinine and/or cystatin C obtained within 24 h of admission: Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD), Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology (CKD-EPIcr, CKD-EPIcys, CKD-EPIcr-cys) and Berlin Initiative Study equations (BIS-1, BIS-2). Delirium was identified with a chart-based method. RESULTS: 571 patients (mean age 83) were enrolled. Delirium occurred in the 34% and was associated with a lower eGFR regardless of the equation used. In a multivariable model, the association between moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30-60 ml/min/1.73 m2) and delirium remained significant in patients aged 75-84 and only when estimated with cystatin-based or BIS-1 equations. Only dementia was significantly associated with delirium in subjects 85+. CONCLUSIONS: in older fracture patients, moderate renal impairment was independently associated with delirium only among subjects aged 75-84, when eGFR was estimated with cystatin-based or BIS 1 equations, and not with the most commonly used equations (MDRD, CKD-EPIcr).
