38934399|t|NECAB family of neuronal calcium-binding proteins in health and disease.
38934399|a|The N-terminal EF-hand calcium-binding proteins 1-3 (NECAB1-3) constitute a family of predominantly neuronal proteins characterized by the presence of at least one EF-hand calcium-binding domain and a functionally less well characterized C-terminal antibiotic biosynthesis monooxygenase domain. All three family members were initially discovered due to their interactions with other proteins. NECAB1 associates with synaptotagmin-1, a critical neuronal protein involved in membrane trafficking and synaptic vesicle exocytosis. NECAB2 interacts with predominantly striatal G-protein-coupled receptors, while NECAB3 partners with amyloid-beta A4 precursor protein-binding family A members 2 and 3, key regulators of amyloid-beta production. This demonstrates the capacity of the family for interactions with various classes of proteins. NECAB proteins exhibit distinct subcellular localizations: NECAB1 is found in the nucleus and cytosol, NECAB2 resides in endosomes and the plasma membrane, and NECAB3 is present in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. The antibiotic biosynthesis monooxygenase domain, an evolutionarily ancient component, is akin to atypical heme oxygenases in prokaryotes but is not well-characterized in vertebrates. Prokaryotic antibiotic biosynthesis monooxygenase domains typically form dimers, suggesting that calcium-mediated conformational changes in NECAB proteins may induce antibiotic biosynthesis monooxygenase domain dimerization, potentially activating some enzymatic properties. However, the substrate for this enzymatic activity remains uncertain. Alternatively, calcium-mediated conformational changes might influence protein interactions or the subcellular localization of NECAB proteins by controlling the availability of protein-protein interaction domains situated between the EF hands and the antibiotic biosynthesis monooxygenase domain. This review summarizes what is known about genomic organization, tissue expression, intracellular localization, interaction partners, and the physiological and pathophysiological role of the NECAB family.
