36614909|a|Purpose: This study retrospectively evaluated the usefulness of the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), prognostic nutritional index (PNI), and pulmonary function test (PFT) results as objective predictors of in-hospital postoperative complications after hip fracture surgery in older adults. Methods: The patients aged >65 years who underwent hip fracture surgery under general anaesthesia were enrolled. In-hospital postoperative complications with preoperative NLR, PNI and PFT results were evaluated. The NLR was calculated as the preoperative neutrophil count/lymphocyte count in peripheral blood. The PNI was calculated as the serum albumin (g/dL) x 10 + total lymphocyte count x 0.005 (/mm3). Results: One hundred ninety nine patients were analysed. The most common postoperative complications were respiratory complications. Compared with patients who did not have postoperative complications, patients with postoperative complications had a significantly higher NLR (8.01 +- 4.70 vs. 5.12 +- 4.34, p < 0.001), whereas they had a significantly lower PNI (38.33 +- 6.80 vs. 42.67 +- 6.47, p < 0.001), preoperative functional vital capacity (FVC; 2.04 +- 0.76 vs. 2.45 +- 0.71 L, p < 0.001), and forced expiratory volume at 1 s (FEV1; 1.43 +- 0.53 vs. 1.78 +- 0.58 L, p < 0.001). Multiple logistic regression analysis identified NLR (odds ratio [OR], 1.142; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.060-1.230; p < 0.001) and FEV1 (OR, 0.340; 95% CI, 0.191-0.603; p < 0.001) as risk factors for postoperative complications after hip fracture surgery. Conclusion: Preoperative NLR and FEV1 are objective predictors of in-hospital postoperative complications after hip fracture surgery in older patients.
