38444813|a|Introduction: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a consequence of living in today's stressful society. Patients have difficulty forgetting traumatic events. lead pollution has many effects on the nervous system, one of which is memory and learning disorders. The herbal medicine Eugenol has a beneficial effect on memory. Aim: This study aims to investigate the protective effect of Eugenol on lead-induced memory impairments in stressed rats. Methods: In the first experiment, the animals were divided into three groups: SPS+Saline, SPS+Pb, and naive. The SPS+Saline, SPS+Pb groups received normal saline and lead through gavage for 21 days, while the sham group remained untreated. Rats were subjected to the modified single prolonged stress model. Memory tests were conducted one week later, evaluating freezing levels in three consecutive tests over three days. In the second experiment, rats were divided into a SPS+Pb+Saline and three treatment groups. The SPS+Pb+Saline group received daily saline injections, while the other groups received different doses of Eugenol (25, 50, and 100 mg/kg). Memory tests similar to the first experiment were conducted. Results: The results showed significantly higher immobility levels in the SPS+Saline and SPS+Pb groups compared to the sham. Additionally, the SPS+Pb group had a significant higher immobility compared to the SPS+Saline group. In the second experiment, the SPS+Pb+EU 25 group showed a significant lower freezing compared to the SPS+Pb+Saline group. Additionally, freezing in the SPS+Pb+EU 50 and SPS+Pb+EU 100 groups was significantly higher than in the SPS+Pb+EU 25 group. The SPS+Pb+EU 50 group showed a significant higher freezing compared to the SPS+Pb+Saline group. Conclusion: lead acetate exacerbated memory impairments in stressed rats and Eugenol, particularly at a dose of 25 mg/kg, improved these impairments. Therefore, Eugenol has the potential to partially reduce the negative effects of lead on memory in individuals with PTSD.
