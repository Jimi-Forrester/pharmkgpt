36405958|a|Objective: To better understand the alterations in gut microbiota and metabolic pathways in children with focal epilepsy, and to further investigate the changes in the related gut microbiota and metabolic pathways in these children before and after treatment. Methods: Ten patients with newly diagnosed focal epilepsy in Hunan Children's Hospital from April, 2020 to October, 2020 were recruited into the case group. The case group was further divided into a pre-treatment subgroup and a post-treatment subgroup. Additionally, 14 healthy children of the same age were recruited into a control group. The microbial communities were analyzed using 16s rDNA sequencing data. Metastas and LEfSe were used to identify different bacteria between and within groups. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes database was used to KEGG enrichment analysis. Results: There were significant differences in alpha diversity among the pre-treatment, post-treatment, and control groups. Besides, the differences in gut microbiota composition in 3 groups were identified by principal co-ordinates analysis (PCoA), which showed a similar composition of the pre-treatment and post-treatment subgroups. At the phyla level, the relative abundance of Actinobacteria in the pre-treatment subgroup was significantly higher than that in the control group, which decreased significantly after 3 months of treatment and showed no significant difference between the control group. In terms of the genus level, Escherichia/Shigella, Streptococcus, Collinsella, and Megamonas were enriched in the pre-treatment subgroup, while Faecalibacterium and Anaerostipes were enriched in the control group. The relative abundance of Escherichia/Shigella, Streptococcus, Collinsella, and Megamonas was reduced significantly after a three-month treatment. Despite some genera remaining significantly different between the post-treatment subgroup and control group, the number of significantly different genera decreased from 9 to 4 through treatment. Notably, we found that the carbohydrate metabolism, especially succinate, was related to focal epilepsy. Conclusion: Children with focal epilepsy compared with healthy controls were associated with the statistically significant differences in the gut microbiota and carbohydrate metabolism. The differences were reduced and the carbohydrate metabolism improved after effective treatment. Our research may provide new directions for understanding the role of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of focal epilepsy and better alternative treatments.
