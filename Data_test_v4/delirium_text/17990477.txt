17990477|t|Fitting complete dentures after multiple tooth extraction in a patient with severe dementia.
17990477|a|Complete dentures were constructed after tooth extraction for a 71-year-old uncommunicative patient with Alzheimer's disease. Although she had never previously used them, her husband requested the fitting of complete maxillary and mandibular dentures. Thirteen teeth were extracted under local anesthesia and intravenous sedation (IVS), followed by impression-making under IVS. Denture fabrication and adjustment were carried out under mild physical restraint. A tissue conditioner was applied to the fitting surface of the denture base followed by regular denture adjustments. The time required for the patient to eat a meal decreased from 90 minutes without dentures to 30 minutes with dentures due to an improvement in swallowing. Important factors in the successful fitting and use of dentures in this patient were the use of IVS to control behavior during treatment, the treatment plan focused on painless denture use, and oral care by the patient's husband.
