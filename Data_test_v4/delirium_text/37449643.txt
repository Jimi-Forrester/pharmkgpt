37449643|a|Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurological disorder characterized by cognitive decline and chronic inflammation within the brain. The ketogenic diet, a widely recognized therapeutic intervention for refractory epilepsy, has recently been proposed as a potential treatment for a variety of neurological diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. However, the efficacy of ketogenic diet in treating Alzheimer's disease and the underlying mechanism remains unclear. The current investigation aimed to explore the effect of ketogenic diet on cognitive function and the underlying biological mechanisms in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. Male amyloid precursor protein/presenilin 1 (APP/PS1) mice were randomly assigned to either a ketogenic diet or control diet group, and received their respective diets for a duration of 3 months. The findings show that ketogenic diet administration enhanced cognitive function, attenuated amyloid plaque formation and proinflammatory cytokine levels in APP/PS1 mice, and augmented the nuclear factor-erythroid 2-p45 derived factor 2/heme oxygenase-1 signaling pathway while suppressing the nuclear factor-kappa B pathway. Collectively, these data suggest that ketogenic diet may have a therapeutic potential in treating Alzheimer's disease by ameliorating the neurotoxicity associated with Abeta-induced inflammation. This study highlights the urgent need for further research into the use of ketogenic diet as a potential therapy for Alzheimer's disease.
