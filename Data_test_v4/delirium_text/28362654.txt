28362654|t|Nursing and Focal Dyscognitive Seizures: A Clinical Update When Managing Risk Using Advanced Nursing Skills.
28362654|a|Focal seizures are divided into simple and dyscognitive, with the latter resulting in the alteration of consciousness. In the ictal and postictal stages, patients may present with confusion, delirium, and psychosis, presenting a risk of safety to themselves and others. This article presents 3 case studies where patients have been admitted for visual and electroencephalographic monitoring. Seizure activity is provoked for the diagnosis and development of a management plan. These cases illustrate the unique nursing implications when caring for patients experiencing focal dyscognitive seizures, highlighting the unique circumstances for the neuroscience nurse regarding risk management, safe administration of radioactive isotopes, detection of subtle seizure manifestation, and use of family as experts in patient-centered care. Through a deliberate onset of seizures, neuroscience nurses are placed in nontypical nursing situations, thus managing risk in unpredictable conditions and displaying advanced and distinctive nursing skills.
