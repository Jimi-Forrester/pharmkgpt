20850138|t|Capillary CAA and perivascular Abeta-deposition: two distinct features of Alzheimer's disease pathology.
20850138|a|Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is frequently seen in Alzheimer's disease (AD) cases and represents one of its histopathological hallmarks. CAA is characterized by amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) deposits within vessel walls. In addition to arteries and veins capillaries can also be affected. Abeta deposition into the capillary wall is, thereby, known as capillary CAA (capCAA) and strongly associated with the apolipoprotein E APOEepsilon4 allele as a risk factor. Abeta deposits along the pericapillary glia limitans are described as pericapillary Abeta (pericapAbeta: synonymous with pericapillary CAA in other studies). Here, we studied the relationship between pericapAbeta and capCAA in 58 human autopsy cases. Although pericapAbeta and capCAA were more frequently found in AD cases compared to controls and although they exhibited a correlation to one another, detailed analysis revealed that there is a significant number of cases with pericapAbeta lacking capCAA and vice versa. Moreover, single capillaries show either both pathologies or pericapAbeta or capCAA only. There was no local association between these pathologies when analyzing multiple capillaries in each given case. Moreover, pericapAbeta predominantly exhibited Abeta(42) whereas capCAA contained both Abeta(42) and Abeta(40). These differences as well as differences in the related astroglial reaction indicate that pericapAbeta and capCAA are not directly linked. PericapAbeta appears to represent initial Abeta accumulation along the glia limitans that is involved in the perivascular drainage of apoE and Abeta regardless of the APOE genotype whereas capCAA could be explained by a limited transendothelial clearance of apoE4-Abeta complexes compared to apoE2/3-Abeta complexes.
