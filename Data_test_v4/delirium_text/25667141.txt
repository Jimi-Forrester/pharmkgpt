25667141|t|Hepatic parenchymal preservation surgery: decreasing morbidity and mortality rates in 4,152 resections for malignancy.
25667141|a|BACKGROUND: Liver resection is used to treat primary and secondary malignancies. Historically, these procedures were associated with significant complications, which may affect cancer-specific outcomes. This study analyzed the changes in morbidity and mortality after hepatic resection over time. STUDY DESIGN: Records of all patients undergoing liver resection for a malignant diagnosis from 1993 to 2012 at Memorial Sloan Kettering were analyzed. Patients were divided into early (1993 to 1999), middle (2000 to 2006), and recent (2007 to 2012) eras. Major hepatectomy was defined as resection of 3 or more segments. Univariate and multivariate analyses were made with t-tests or Mann-Whitney tests. RESULTS: There were 3,875 patients who underwent 4,152 resections for malignancy. The most common diagnosis was metastatic colorectal cancer (n = 2,476, 64% of patients). Over the study period, 90-day mortality rate decreased from 5% to 1.6% (p < 0.001). Perioperative morbidity decreased from 53% to 20% (p < 0.001). The percentage of major hepatectomies decreased from 66% to 36% (p < 0.001). The rate of perioperative transfusion decreased from 51% to 21% (p < 0.001). The spectrum of perioperative morbidity changed markedly over time, with abdominal infections (43% of complications) overtaking cardiopulmonary complications (22% of complications). Peak postoperative bilirubin (odds ratio [OR] 1.1, p < 0.001), blood loss (OR 1.5, p = 0.001), major hepatectomy (OR 1.3, p = 0.031), and concurrent partial colectomy (OR 2.4, p < 0.001) were independent predictors of perioperative morbidity. The mortality associated with trisectionectomy (6%) and right hepatectomy (3%) remained unchanged over time. CONCLUSIONS: Morbidity and mortality rates after partial hepatectomy for cancer have decreased substantially as the major hepatectomy rate has dropped. Encouraging parenchymal preservation and preventing abdominal infections are vital for continued improvement of liver resection outcomes.
