36820220|t|Increasing Use of Telemedicine for Neurological Disorders During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Mini-Review.
36820220|a|Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a highly contagious viral infection. In addition to its association with common pulmonary and gastrointestinal complications, COVID-19 is also associated with numerous neurological and neuropsychiatric conditions. This minireview aims to cover current literature addressing the application of telemedicine in neurological disorders and neuropsychiatric conditions, especially in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This article revealed that quarantine, masking, and social distancing policies practiced during the COVID-19 pandemic involved restrictions and challenges to providing medical services, especially for patients with neurological disorders with or without COVID-19 infection. During the pandemic, both healthcare administrators and clinicians, including neurologists, have rapidly adapted or introduced telemedicine technologies for delivering specialty care. In some areas in the world, telemedicine has been successfully applied to reduce the impact imposed by COVID-19. Conclusively, this article supports the idea that telemedicine is an effective tool for providing specialized healthcare for patients with neurological conditions while adhering to social distancing or lockdown policies instituted during the COVID-19 pandemic. Government and medical/healthcare authorities, physicians and healthcare providers need to work together to expand the adoption of telemedicine applications, even after the COVID-19 crisis.
