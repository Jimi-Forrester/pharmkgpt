8041245|a|Forty-three female inpatients with active systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) were studied by a multidisciplinary team to answer the following research questions: 1) What are the features of the psychopathology in patients with active SLE? and 2) In these patients, what is the relationship between psychiatric disorders and symptoms and signs suggesting activity of SLE in the CNS? Our a priori hypothesis was that, in patients with active SLE, those with psychiatric manifestations would have more symptoms and signs of CNS activity than those without psychiatric manifestations. Psychiatric evaluation consisted of standardized psychiatric instruments and diagnostic criteria. The assessment of SLE systemic and central nervous system (CNS) activity consisted of rheumatologic, neurologic, and ophthalmologic evaluations; serum and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) analysis; brain computerized tomography (CT); and electroencephalogram (EEG). Twenty-seven patients (63%) presented psychiatric symptoms (Psychiatric Group), and 16 (37%) patients presented no current psychiatric diagnosis (Nonpsychiatric Group). These groups were compared in terms of the above variables. Depressive syndrome was the most frequent diagnosis (44%) followed by delirium (7%) and dementia (5%). Psychiatric symptoms were associated with subjective cognitive impairment (85%) and neurologic abnormality (85%). Widened cortical sulci was the most frequent CT alteration and was equally common in both groups. No statistical difference was found between the 2 groups regarding their general clinical evaluation, serum and CSF exams, or EEG alterations. To determine whether the severity of psychiatric symptoms was related to CNS activity, we divided the 27 patients with psychiatric manifestations into 2 groups: the Major Group--18 patients with major psychopathology, and the Minor Group--9 patients with mild depressive syndromes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
