39034937|t|Long COVID Definition, Symptoms, Risk Factors, Epidemiology and Autoimmunity: A Narrative Review.
39034937|a|The virus called SARS-CoV-2 emerged in 2019 and quickly spread worldwide, causing COVID-19. It has greatly impacted on everyday life, healthcare systems, and the global economy. In order to save as many lives as possible, precautions such as social distancing, quarantine, and testing policies were implemented, and effective vaccines were developed. A growing amount of data collected worldwide allowed the characterization of this new disease, which turned out to be more complex than other common respiratory tract infections. An increasing number of convalescents presented with a variety of nonspecific symptoms emerging after the acute infection. This possible new global health problem was identified and labelled as long COVID. Since then, a great effort has been made by clinicians and the scientific community to understand the underlying mechanisms and to develop preventive measures and effective treatment. The role of autoimmunity induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection in the development of long COVID is discussed in this review. We aim to deliver a description of several conditions with an autoimmune background observed in COVID-19 convalescents, including Guillain-Barre syndrome, antiphospholipid syndrome and related thrombosis, and Kawasaki disease highlighting a relationship between SARS-CoV-2 infection and the development of autoimmunity. However, further studies are required to determine its true clinical significance.
