20817005|t|BACE: Therapeutic target and potential biomarker for Alzheimer's disease.
20817005|a|beta-Site APP-cleaving enzyme (BACE) is a membrane-bound aspartyl protease involved in the production of Alzheimer's disease (AD) Abeta amyloid peptides. This enzyme is ubiquitously expressed, with highest levels in the brain and pancreas. Its cellular trafficking is tightly controlled as it recycles between endosomes and trans-Golgi network. BACE expression increases in response to aging and various stress stimuli. It is elevated in the brain cortex of AD sufferers, and increased levels of BACE in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with mild cognitive impairment may provide an early biomarker of AD. BACE is considered as a rational drug target for AD therapy, and inhibitors are under development. Anomalies in the behaviour and biochemistry of BACE(-/-) mice have pointed to the role this enzyme plays in the processing of neuregulin and of voltage-gated sodium channel beta-subunit. A full understanding of BACE biology in health and disease is needed to establish a safe AD therapy based on BACE inhibitors.
