12369973|a|Recently advances in understanding the molecular basis of Alzheimer's disease have led to the consideration of the relationship between cholinergic inhibitors and amyloid deposition as a new hypothesis for the future rational design of effective anti-Alzheimer drugs. In the present review, the non-cholinergic functions of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and the therapeutic potential of peripheral and dual binding site AChE inhibitors in delaying the neurodegenerative process will be discussed.
