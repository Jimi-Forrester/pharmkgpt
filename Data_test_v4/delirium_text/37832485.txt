37832485|a|Exposure to particulate matter (PM) has been associated with a range of health impacts, including neurological abnormalities that affect neurodevelopment, neuroplasticity, and behavior. Recently, there has been growing interest in investigating the possible relationship between PM exposure and the onset and progression of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and multiple sclerosis. However, the precise mechanism by which PM affects neurodegeneration is still unclear, even though several epidemiological and animal model studies have provided mechanistic insights. This article presents a review of the current research on the neurotoxicity of PM and its impact on neurodegenerative diseases. This review summarizes findings from epidemiological and animal model studies collected through searches in Google Scholar, PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus. This review paper also discusses the reported effects of PM exposure on the central nervous system and highlights research gaps and future directions. The information presented in this review may inform public health policies aimed at reducing PM exposure and may contribute to the development of new treatments for neurodegenerative diseases. Further mechanistic and therapeutic research will be needed to fully understand the relationship between PM exposure and neurodegenerative diseases.
