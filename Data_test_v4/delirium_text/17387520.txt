17387520|a|BACKGROUND: Delirium is among the most common neuropsychiatric complications of advanced cancer. The Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale (MDAS) is a widely used and validated screening tool for delirium in cancer patients. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess the use of the MDAS by different palliative care health professionals after receiving formal training and a guiding manual for administration and scoring. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-one palliative care health professionals received a training session on the MDAS, including description of the tool, validation, and scoring. Participants also received copies of a proposed standardized manual for completion of the MDAS. Two of the investigators presented three simulated cases to the participants, who independently completed a scoring sheet for each case. The data were then analyzed according to the cases and the profession of the operators. RESULTS: Thirty-one scoring sheets were analyzed (11 physicians, 12 nurses, and 8 others). A correct diagnosis was achieved by 30 (96.8%) of the 31 participants in case 1 (nondelirious, true score = 5, median = 5, range = 2-15), 28 of 31 (90.3%) in case 2 (severe mixed delirium, true score = 20, median = 18, range = 10-26), and 31 of 31 in case 3 (mild hypoactive delirium, true score = 14, median = 19, range = 13-25). Overall percentage of error was 31% for items 2, 3, and 4 (cognitive) and 45% for all other items (observational) (p < 0.001). The percentage of error did not differ between physicians and nurses and other palliative care professionals (p > 0.99). CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary results suggest that adequate training and a guiding manual can enhance the application of MDAS by palliative care health professionals in the teaching settings. Clinical studies to assess the utility of the MDAS as a screening tool are justified to further confirm these findings.
