39692624|a|The immune system is a key player in the onset and progression of neurodegenerative disorders. While brain resident immune cell-mediated neuroinflammation and peripheral immune cell (eg, T cell) infiltration into the brain have been shown to significantly contribute to Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology, the nature and extent of immune responses in the brain in the context of AD and related dementias (ADRD) remain unclear. Furthermore, the roles of the peripheral immune system in driving ADRD pathology remain incompletely elucidated. In March of 2023, the Alzheimer's Association convened the Alzheimer's Association International Conference (AAIC), Advancements: Immunity, to discuss the roles of the immune system in ADRD. A wide range of topics were discussed, such as animal models that replicate human pathology, immune-related biomarkers and clinical trials, and lessons from other fields describing immune responses in neurodegeneration. This manuscript presents highlights from the conference and outlines avenues for future research on the roles of immunity in neurodegenerative disorders. HIGHLIGHTS: The immune system plays a central role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. The immune system exerts numerous effects throughout the brain on amyloid-beta, tau, and other pathways. The 2023 AAIC, Advancements: Immunity, encouraged discussions and collaborations on understanding the role of the immune system.
