34268353|a|BACKGROUND: Little is known regarding the survival and functional recovery of elderly intertrochanteric hip fracture (IHF) patients after total hip arthroplasty (THA) versus percutaneous external fixation (PEF). This study aims to analyze the prognostic factors of THA and PEF in elderly IHF patients. METHODS: A total of 155 consecutive elderly patients (mean age of 80 years) diagnosed with IHF were retrospectively reviewed from our database between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2018. The preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative covariates were analyzed by two independent surgical cohorts: THA and PEF. The main outcomes included the hip function score, all-cause mortality within 1 year after surgery, and overall survival. Covariables and their influence on independent outcomes were analyzed using multivariate regression models. RESULTS: The median follow-up period was 5.1 years, and 6 patients were lost to follow-up. At the endpoint, 70 of 85 patients treated with THA and 37 of 70 patients treated with PEF survived, exhibiting mean Harris hip scores of 84.4 and 69.0, respectively. The Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank tests showed no significant difference in overall survival. After adjusting for the covariates, the surgical mode was a unique prognostic factor affecting hip function recovery, and two prognostic factors (leukocyte count and D-dimer) were correlated with 1-year all-cause mortality. Age at admission, fracture classification, D-dimer level and surgical mode were identified as prognostic factors affecting overall survival. After adjusting for the former three covariates, THA reduced the risk of death by 67.20% compared with PEF (HR 0.328, 95% CI, 0.121-0.890). CONCLUSIONS: Despite the nonsignificant difference in 1-year all-cause mortality, THA demonstrated superior midterm survival and hip function recovery in elderly IHF patients compared with PEF. Predictive factors, including age at admission, fracture classification, D-dimer level and surgical mode, are associated with the overall survival of IHF in high-risk elderly patients.
