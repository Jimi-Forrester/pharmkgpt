31939203|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressing neurodegenerative disorder and the main cause of serious irreversible cognitive decline in elderly people. Visinin-like protein 1 (VILIP-1) is a member of the family of calcium-binding proteins and plays a crucial role in AD pathophysiology. Multiple studies have shown that CSF levels of VILIP-1 are increased in AD patients compared to normal controls, or other neurodegenerative conditions. We searched online databases for studies on the levels of VILIP-1 in the CSF of AD patients in comparison to normal controls, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients and Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) patients. A total of ten studies were used for the comparison between AD and controls, three studies for the comparison between AD and MCI, two studies for AD and DLB and two studies for the comparison between stable MCI and MCI progressed to AD. We found that VILIP-1 levels are significantly higher in AD compared to normal controls, but not to the other groups, and furthermore, they are significantly higher in patient with MCI progressed to AD, than in stable MCI patients.
