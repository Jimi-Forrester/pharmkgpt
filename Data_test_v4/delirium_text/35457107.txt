35457107|t|Stem Cell Homing in Intrathecal Applications and Inspirations for Improvement Paths.
35457107|a|A transplanted stem cell homing is a directed migration from the application site to the targeted tissue. Intrathecal application of stem cells is their direct delivery to cerebrospinal fluid, which defines the homing path from the point of injection to the brain. In the case of neurodegenerative diseases, this application method has the advantage of no blood-brain barrier restriction. However, the homing efficiency still needs improvement and homing mechanisms elucidation. Analysis of current research results on homing mechanisms in the light of intrathecal administration revealed a discrepancy between in vivo and in vitro results and a gap between preclinical and clinical research. Combining the existing research with novel insights from cutting-edge biochips, nano, and other technologies and computational models may bridge this gap faster.
