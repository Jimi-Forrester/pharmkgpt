20637283|t|Tetracycline and its analogues protect Caenorhabditis elegans from beta amyloid-induced toxicity by targeting oligomers.
20637283|a|The accumulation and deposition of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide in extracellular dense plaques in the brain is a key phase in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Small oligomeric forms of Abeta are responsible for the toxicity and the early cognitive impairment observed in patients before the amyloid plaque deposits appear. It is essential for the development of an efficient cure for AD to identify compounds that interfere with Abeta aggregation, counteracting the molecular mechanisms involved in conversion of the monomeric amyloid protein into oligomeric and fibrillar forms. Tetracyclines have been proposed for AD therapy, although their effects on the aggregation of Abeta protein, particularly their ability to interact in vivo with the Abeta oligomers and/or aggregates, remain to be understood. Using transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans as a simplified invertebrate model of AD, we evaluated the ability of tetracyclines to interfere with the sequence of events leading to Abeta proteotoxicity. The drugs directly interact with the Abeta assemblies in vivo and reduce Abeta oligomer deposition, protecting C. elegans from oxidative stress and the onset of the paralysis phenotype. These effects were specific, dose-related and not linked to any antibiotic activity, suggesting that the drugs might offer an effective therapeutic strategy to target soluble Abeta aggregates.
