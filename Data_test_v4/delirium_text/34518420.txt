34518420|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The purpose is to evaluate the construct validity of two generic health measures, the Health Utilities Index Mark 2 (HUI2) and Mark 3 (HUI3) in residents of long-term care (LTC) facilities, using a convergent/divergent validity approach, with the Functional Independence Measure (FIM), Quality of Life-Alzheimer's Disease (QOL-AD) and Resident Assessment Instrument (RAI) 2.0 as comparators. METHODS: Health status of 130 residents with dementia residing in one of seven LTC facilities was evaluated by their Healthcare Aides who were their primary care assistants. A priori hypotheses on the magnitude and direction of the correlations were formulated by two clinician/researchers and a researcher familiar with the measures and this population. Predicted and observed correlations were compared. RESULTS: Mean overall HUI2 (0.48, SD 0.16) and HUI3 scores (0.31, SD 0.27) were indicative of severe disability. Of the 208 a priori hypotheses, 39.9% (n = 83) matched the observed correlations, 29.8% were underestimated and 19.7% were overestimated by one category. CONCLUSIONS: Findings support the use of the HUI2 and HUI3 in measuring health-related quality of life in dementia-related research to complement disease-specific measures.
