38241579|a|This study aims to summarize the prognosis and risk factors of nonoperative treatment patients of hip fracture with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). A total of 113 individuals of hip fracture with nonoperative treatment were retrospectively enrolled, 38 patients with ESRD were defined as the observation group, and the other 75 patients without ESRD were served as the control group. The difference in 30-day and 1-year mortality rate between the 2 groups was compared. The effects of risk factors on survival were estimated by the Cox proportional-hazards model. The survival difference was estimated by the method of Kaplan-Meier. In the subsequent subgroup analysis of the observation group, as before, the Cox proportional-hazards model and the Kaplan-Meier method were used. The 1-year mortality rate of the observation group was considerably higher than that of the control group, which was 86.84% and 32.0%, respectively (P < .005). For nonoperative treatment hip fracture subjects, ESRD, age >= 82, BMI (BMI) < 20, high Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) and low Barthel Index (BI) were associated with a low survival curve (P < .05). In the subsequent multivariable subgroup analyses, for nonoperative treatment hip fracture subjects with ESRD, high CCI and low BI were also the independent risk factors of mortality. For nonoperative treatment hip fracture subjects, ESRD, old age, low BMI, high CCI and low BI were the independent risk factors of mortality. For hip fracture subjects with ESRD, nonoperative treatment was associated with excess high 1-year mortality rate, especially for patients with high CCI and low BI.
