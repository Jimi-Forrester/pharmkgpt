39410886|t|Decoding the Therapeutic Potential of Cannabis and Cannabinoids in Neurological Disorders.
39410886|a|For millennia, Cannabis sativa has served diverse roles, from medicinal applications to recreational use. Despite its extensive historical use, only a fraction of its components have been explored until recent times. The therapeutic potential of Cannabis and its constituents has garnered attention, with suggestions for treating various conditions such as Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease, and other Neurological disorders. Recent research, particularly on animal experimental models, has unveiled the neuroprotective properties of cannabis. This neuroprotective effect is orchestrated through numerous G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and the two cannabinoid receptors, CB1 and CB2. While the capacity of cannabinoids to safeguard neurons is evident, a significant challenge lies in determining the optimal cannabinoid receptor agonist and its application in clinical trials. The intricate interplay of cannabinoids with the endocannabinoid system, involving CB1 and CB2 receptors, underscores the need for precise understanding and targeted approaches. Unravelling the molecular intricacies of this interaction is vital to harness the therapeutic potential of cannabinoids effectively. As the exploration of cannabis components accelerates, there is a growing awareness of the need for nuanced strategies in utilizing cannabinoid receptor agonists in clinical settings. The evolving landscape of cannabis research presents exciting possibilities for developing targeted interventions that capitalize on the neuroprotective benefits of cannabinoids while navigating the complexities of receptor specificity and clinical applicability.
