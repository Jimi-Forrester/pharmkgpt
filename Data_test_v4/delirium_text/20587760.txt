20587760|a|BACKGROUND: Delirium is a common complication of myeloablative hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT), yet no studies have explored the later effects of an episode of delirium in this setting on patients' decision-making capacity after the acute symptoms of delirium have resolved. OBJECTIVE: The authors assessed the impact of delirium during the acute phase of myeloablative HSCT on later decision-making capacity. METHOD: Decision-making capacity was assessed with the MacArthur Competence Assessment Tool in 19 patients before they received their first HSCT and at 30 and 80 days post-transplantation. Delirium was assessed 3 times per week with the Delirium Rating Scale and the Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale from 7 days pre-transplantation through 30 days post-transplantation. RESULTS: Although there was little variance in the pre-treatment scores, with most patients showing very high or perfect scores on decision-making abilities, a multivariate regression model showed that delirium was predictive of a lower reasoning score at Day 30 post-transplantation. CONCLUSION: Patients who experienced a delirium episode during the acute phase of HSCT were not likely to develop clinically meaningful impairments in decision-making capacity post-transplantation, although they evidenced minor impairment in their reasoning ability.
