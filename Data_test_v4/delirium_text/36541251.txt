Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) activation has been suggested to decrease oxidative stress. In the current research, the effect of PPARgamma activation by pioglitazone(Pio) on learning, memory and oxidative stress was evaluated in aged rats. The rats were divided into five groups. In the Control group, vehicle (saline-diluted dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)) and saline were injected instead of Pio and scopolamine (Sco), respectively. In the Sco group, the vehicle was injected instead of Pio and the rats were injected by Sco 30 min before the behavioral tests. In the Sco-Pio 10, Sco-Pio 20, and Sco-Pio 30 groups, 10, 20, and 30 mg/kg Pio was injected and finally, the rats were injected with Sco 30 min before the behavioral tests. Morris water mater maze(MWM) and passive avoidance(PA) tests were carried out, and finally, the hippocampus and cortex were removed for biochemical assessments. The results showed that the highest dose of Pio decreased the traveling time and distance during 5 days of learning and increased the time and distance in the target area on the probe day of MWM. The highest dose of Pio also prolonged the delay time for entering the dark and total time spent in the light while decreasing the total time spent in and the number of entries into the dark in PA test. Pio especially, in the medium and highest doses, decreased MDA while increasing thiol, superoxide dismutase, and catalase in the hippocampus and cortex. It is concluded that PPARgamma activation by Pio as an agonist improved learning and memory in aged rats probably by attenuating oxidative stress in the hippocampus and cortex.
