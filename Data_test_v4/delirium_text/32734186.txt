32734186|a|Use of desmopressin (1-deamino-8-d-arginine vasopressin; DDAVP), a synthetic vasopressin receptor agonist, has expanded in recent years. Desmopressin leads to renal water retention, and iatrogenic hyponatremia may result if fluid intake is not appropriately restricted. It is common practice to stop a medication that is causing toxicity, and this advice is promulgated in Micromedex, which suggests withholding desmopressin if hyponatremia occurs. If intravenous saline solution is administered and desmopressin is withheld at the same time, rapid changes in serum sodium levels may result, which puts the patient at risk for demyelinating lesions. In the management of desmopressin-associated hyponatremia with neurologic symptoms, the drug should not be withheld despite the presence of hyponatremia. The medication should be continued while administering intravenous hypertonic saline solution. Desmopressin is also used to minimize water excretion during the correction of hyponatremia during water diuresis. When treating hyponatremia, clinicians should monitor closely to avoid free-water diuresis. To prevent ongoing water losses in urine and overly rapid "autocorrection" of serum sodium level, desmopressin can be given to reduce free-water losses. These treatment recommendations are the authors' perspective from previously published work and personal clinical experience.
