36296678|a|Neuronal-regulated cell death (RCD) due to the accumulation of ROS within the central nervous system (CNS) is one of the crucial causes of central system diseases. Caspase-dependent apoptosis is the only form of RCD. As research progressed, several nonapoptotic cell death pathway RCDs were identified. Ferroptosis is a nonapoptotic RCD characterized by lipid peroxidation and plasma membrane damage. Polygonatum cyrtonema Hua. Polysaccharides (PCP) are an effective antioxidant. Based on this, the protective effect and mechanism of PCP against H2O2-induced microglial injury were investigated. Furthermore, the protective mechanism of PCP against ferroptosis in microglia was explored. Our results indicated that PCP could reduce oxidative stress-induced ROS accumulation by activating the NRF2/HO-1 signaling pathway, thus attenuating RCD in microglia. Subsequent studies have revealed that PCP alleviates ferroptosis in microglia due to protein levels of ERASTIN/RSL3 inhibitor SLC7A11/GPX4 by activating the NRF2/HO-1 signaling pathway. Therefore, we hypothesized that PCP exerts antioxidative and anti-ferroptosis effects by activating the expression of the NRF2/HO-1 pathway. This facilitates new ideas for clinically effective prevention and treatment of diseases due to accumulated reactive oxygen species in the CNS. Simultaneously, PCP has the development potential as a new drug candidate for treating CNS diseases.
