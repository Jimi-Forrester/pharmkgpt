36405993|a|An imbalance of plasma apolipoproteins has been linked to diabetic retinopathy (DR); however, there is scarce information regarding their presence in the aqueous humor (AH) and their role in DR. Here, we aimed at analysing the relationship between apolipoprotein concentrations in human AH and the severity of DR. Concentrations of apolipoproteins were measured retrospectively in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) without DR (n = 23), with mild to moderate nonproliferative DR (NPDR) (n = 13), and advanced NPDR/proliferative DR (PDR) (n = 14) using a multiplex immunoassay. Compared to the non-apparent DR group, the concentrations of seven apolipoproteins were elevated in advanced NPDR/PDR (Apo AI 5.8-fold, Apo AII 4.5-fold, Apo CI 3.3-fold, Apo CIII 6.8-fold, Apo D 3.3-fold, Apo E 2.4-fold, and Apo H 6.6-fold). No significant differences were observed in apolipoprotein concentrations between patients with non-apparent DR and healthy controls (n = 17). In conclusion, the AH concentrations of apolipoproteins AI, AII, CI, CIII, D, E, and H increased in advancing stages of DR, suggesting their role in the pathogenesis of DR, which deserves further examination.
