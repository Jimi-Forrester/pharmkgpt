1274812|t|Physostigmine treatment of delirium induced by anticholinergics.
1274812|a|Medication with anticholinergic properties are used commonly in family practice. Toxic delirium, which may resemble an acute psychosis, can occur as an adverse drug reaction to properly prescribed anticholingeric medication and to recommended doses of many patent medicines. More frequently it is due to overdosage. The key to diagnosis is the presence of peripheral signs of parasympathetic blockade. Delirium induced by anticholinergic drugs can be treated rapidly and effectively with physostigmine salicylate.
