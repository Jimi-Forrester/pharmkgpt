33078369|t|Neurobiochemical Cross-talk Between COVID-19 and Alzheimer's Disease.
33078369|a|COVID-19, the global threat to humanity, shares etiological cofactors with multiple diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Understanding the common links between COVID-19 and AD would harness strategizing therapeutic approaches against both. Considering the urgency of formulating COVID-19 medication, its AD association and manifestations have been reviewed here, putting emphasis on memory and learning disruption. COVID-19 and AD share common links with respect to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors and pro-inflammatory markers such as interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, cytoskeleton-associated protein 4 (CKAP4), galectin-9 (GAL-9 or Gal-9), and APOE4 allele. Common etiological factors and common manifestations described in this review would aid in developing therapeutic strategies for both COVID-19 and AD and thus impact on eradicating the ongoing global threat. Thus, people suffering from COVID-19 or who have come round of it as well as people at risk of developing AD or already suffering from AD, would be benefitted.
