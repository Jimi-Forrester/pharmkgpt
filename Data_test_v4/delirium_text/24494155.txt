24494155|t|Opium induces apoptosis in jurkat cells.
24494155|a|BACKGROUND: The direct effect of some opioids on immune cells has been demonstrated. The aim of this study was to assess the apoptotic effect of opium on Jurkat T lymphocyte cells. METHODS: Different concentrations of opium (2.86 x 10-3 to 2.86 x 10-11 g/ml) were added to 24-well plates containing 5 x 105 Jurkat cells. Apoptotic events were assessed after 6, 24, and 72 hours by flow-cytometric detection of surface phosphatidylserine. FINDINGS: Significant differences in apoptosis of Jurkat cells were seen at 24 and 72 hours in different concentrations of opium (P < 0.05). After 72 hours, significant increase in necrosis of Jurkat cells was seen in opium concentration of 2.85 x 10-3 g/ml compared to cells without opium (control) (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: These results showed that opium directly increases apoptosis and necrosis of T lymphocytes. This effect may play a role in immune dysfunction in opium addicts.
