20141797|a|Electroconvulsivotherapy represents a key indication for severe Major Depressive Episode (MDE). However, an hospitalization with a general anaesthesia allowing a seizure induction followed by an almost systematic post-epileptic delirium justifies the development of other brain electrostimulation techniques. Trans-cranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is a technique which offers to transform an electromagnetic field within the brain in an electric one. This therapeutic has been approved in 2008 in the MDE indication by the Food and Drug Administration. However a better knowledge of brain stimulation parameters such as the number of sequences, intensity, frequency, and the brain target, is necessary. Indeed it could enable to get some more homogeneous clinical results which will drive to the use of this technique in daily practice. Neurosurgical procedures represent also a stake for a better treatment of severe chronic and resistant depression. Whereas Vagus Nerve Stimulation (DBS) failed to be developed in France, Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is currently under development in this indication with some promising preliminary results.
