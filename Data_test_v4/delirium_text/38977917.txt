38977917|a|Mycobacterium avium complex pulmonary disease (MAC-PD) has a heterogeneous clinical course. However, immune profiles associated with MAC-PD clinical course are limited. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 21 MAC-PD patients divided into three clinical courses: group A, spontaneous culture conversion; group B, stable disease without antibiotic treatment; and group C, progressive disease with antibiotic treatment. A lower proportion of NK cells and higher proportion of monocytes were noted in group C compared to combined groups A and B. The proportion of classical monocytes was higher in group C compared to groups A and B, while the proportion of non-classical monocytes decreased. EGR1, HSPA1A, HSPA1B, and CD83 were up-regulated in spontaneous culture conversion group A compared to progressive disease group C. Up-regulation of MYOM2 and LILRA4 and down-regulation of MT-ATP8, CD83, and CCL3L1 was found in progressive disease group C. PCBP1, FOS, RGCC, S100B, G0S2, AREG, and LYN were highly expressed in favorable treatment response compared to unfavorable response. Our findings may offer a comprehensive understanding of the host immune profiles that influence a particular MAC-PD clinical course and could suggest an immunological mechanism associated with the disease progression of MAC-PD.
