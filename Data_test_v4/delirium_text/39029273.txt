Therefore, we aimed to examine the volumetric and functional changes of the thalamic nuclei at different scales across AD stages. METHODS: MRI data of patients diagnosed with 20 AD dementia (ADD), 30 amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 30 subjective cognitive impairment (SCI) were used. Volumetric and functional connectivity analyzes were performed by dividing the thalamus into anterior, medial, posterior, lateral and intralaminar nucleus groups and their specific subnuclei. RESULTS: In the course of AD, the volume of the medial group nuclei, especially the mediodorsal medial magnocellular (MDm) nucleus, decreases. Medial group nuclei and MDm functional connectivity with frontal areas were decreased both in ADD and MCI compared to SCI group, while both of them increased their functional connectivity with visual areas in the ADD group compared to the MCI group. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that the medial group of the thalamus, and specifically the MDm, may be affected in AD. SIGNIFICANCE: Specific thalamic nuclei may be a critical anatomical region for investigating structural and functional changes in AD.
