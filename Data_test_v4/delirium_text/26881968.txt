26881968|t|Wbp2 is required for normal glutamatergic synapses in the cochlea and is crucial for hearing.
26881968|a|WBP2 encodes the WW domain-binding protein 2 that acts as a transcriptional coactivator for estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1) and progesterone receptor (PGR). We reported that the loss of Wbp2 expression leads to progressive high-frequency hearing loss in mouse, as well as in two deaf children, each carrying two different variants in the WBP2 gene. The earliest abnormality we detect in Wbp2-deficient mice is a primary defect at inner hair cell afferent synapses. This study defines a new gene involved in the molecular pathway linking hearing impairment to hormonal signalling and provides new therapeutic targets.
