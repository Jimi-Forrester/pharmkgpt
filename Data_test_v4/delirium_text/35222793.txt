35222793|t|Geraniin Protects against Cerebral Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury by Suppressing Oxidative Stress and Neuronal Apoptosis via Regulation of the Nrf2/HO-1 Pathway.
35222793|a|Geraniin, a polyphenol isolated from Phyllanthus amarus, possesses extensive biological and pharmaceutical activities. In this study, we investigated the protective effect against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury of geraniin and explored its potential mechanism. Middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R) was used to simulate cerebral I/R injury in vivo, and oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) was applied to establish an in vitro model of cerebral I/R injury. In this study, we performed TTC and HE staining and adopted a neurological score method to evaluate the neuroprotective effect of geraniin in vivo and used the CCK-8 assay to assess this effect in vitro. Indices of reactive oxidation capacity were measured in vivo and in vitro to verify the antioxidant capacity of geraniin. TUNEL staining and flow cytometry were applied to measure the apoptosis rate, and Western blotting was performed to assess the expression of apoptosis-related proteins. Finally, the expression of Nrf2 and HO-1 was evaluated in vivo and in vitro by Western blotting. Geraniin significantly reduced the infarct volume, decreased neurological deficit scores, alleviated pathological changes in neurons, and increased the cell survival rate. Geraniin increased the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and decreased the activity of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and the contents of malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO), and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) in vivo and in vitro. In addition, geraniin significantly reduced the apoptosis. Furthermore, geraniin also evidently increased Nrf2 (total and nuclear) and HO-1 protein expression in vivo and in vitro. Collectively, these results imply that geraniin may exert a protective effect against cerebral I/R injury by suppressing oxidative stress and neuronal apoptosis. The mechanism underlying the protective effect of geraniin is associated with activation of the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway. Our results indicate that geraniin may be a potential drug candidate for the treatment of ischemic stroke.
