32722660|a|Parvalbumin-expressing interneurons (PV-INs) are highly vulnerable to stressors and have been implicated in many neuro-psychiatric diseases such as schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, autism spectrum disorder, and bipolar disorder. We examined the literature about the current knowledge of the physiological properties of PV-INs and gathered results from diverse research areas to provide insight into their vulnerability to stressors. Among the factors that confer heightened vulnerability are the substantial energy requirements, a strong excitatory drive, and a unique developmental trajectory. Understanding these stressors and elaborating on their impact on PV-IN health is a step toward developing therapies to protect these neurons in various disease states and to retain critical brain functions.
