35305696|a|BACKGROUND: Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder whereby mutated huntingtin protein (mHTT) aggregates when polyglutamine repeats in the N-terminal of mHTT exceeds 36 glutamines (Q). However, the mechanism of this pathology is unknown. Siah1-interacting protein (SIP) acts as an adaptor protein in the ubiquitination complex and mediates degradation of other proteins. We hypothesized that mHTT aggregation depends on the dysregulation of SIP activity in this pathway in HD. RESULTS: A higher SIP dimer/monomer ratio was observed in the striatum in young YAC128 mice, which overexpress mHTT. We found that SIP interacted with HTT. In a cellular HD model, we found that wildtype SIP increased mHTT ubiquitination, attenuated mHTT protein levels, and decreased HTT aggregation. We predicted mutations that should stabilize SIP dimerization and found that SIP mutant-overexpressing cells formed more stable dimers and had lower activity in facilitating mHTT ubiquitination and preventing exon 1 mHTT aggregation compared with wildtype SIP. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that an increase in SIP dimerization in HD medium spiny neurons leads to a decrease in SIP function in the degradation of mHTT through a ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and consequently an increase in mHTT aggregation. Therefore, SIP could be considered a potential target for anti-HD therapy during the early stage of HD pathology.
