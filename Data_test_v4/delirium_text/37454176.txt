37454176|a|The essential oil isolated by hydrodistillation of the oleogum resin of Araucaria heterophylla has been analyzed by GC-MS. Twenty-four components accounting to 99.89% of the total detected constituents of this essential oil were identified. The major ones were: caryophyllene oxide (14.8%), ( +)-sabinene (12.07%), D-limonene (11.22%), caryophyllene (10.36%), alpha-copaene (8.00%), beta-pinene (6.44%), trans-verbenol (5.88%) and alpha-pinene oxide (5.18%). The in vitro inhibitory activities of this oil against aldose reductase, BuCHE, COX-2 and SARS-CoV-2 Mpro enzymes were evaluated. This revealed promising inhibitory activity of the essential oil against both aldose reductase and BuCHE enzymes. The molecular docking study of the major components of the Araucaria heterophylla essential oil was carried out to correlate their binding modes and affinities for aldose reductase and BuCHE enzymes with the in vitro results. In conclusion, the in vitro inhibitory activity of the essential oil attributed to the synergistic effect between its components and the in silico study suggested that compounds containing epoxide and hydroxyl groups may be responsible for this activity. This study is preliminary screening for the oil to be used as antidiabetic cataract and Alzheimer's disease therapeutics and further investigations may be required.
