26806386|a|INTRODUCTION: The present study investigated the relationship between beta-amyloid (Abeta) and cognition in a late middle-aged cohort at risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: One eighty-four participants (mean age = 60; 72% parental history of AD) completed a [C-11]Pittsburgh compound B positron emission tomography scan and serial cognitive evaluations. A global measure of Abeta burden was calculated, and composite scores assessing learning, delayed memory, and executive functioning were computed. RESULTS: Higher Abeta was associated with classification of psychometric mild cognitive impairment (MCI) at follow-up (P < .01). Linear mixed effects regression results indicated higher Abeta was associated with greater rates of decline in delayed memory (P < .01) and executive functioning (P < .05). Apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon4 status moderated the relationship between Abeta and cognitive trajectories (P values <.01). DISCUSSION: In individuals at risk for AD, greater Abeta in late middle age is associated with increased likelihood of MCI at follow-up and steeper rates of cognitive decline.
