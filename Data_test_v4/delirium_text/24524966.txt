24524966|a|Impaired growth factor function is thought to drive many of the alterations observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Endogenous regenerative technology, PRGF (plasma rich in growth factor)-Endoret, is designed for the delivery of a complex pool of patient's own active morphogens that may stimulate tissue regeneration. We obtained and characterized PRGF-Endoret preparations from human blood. We used, as experimental approach in vivo, APP/PS1 mice, characterized by age-dependent brain amyloid-beta (Abeta) accumulation. Intranasal administration of PRGF-Endoret to APP/PS1 mice resulted in an important decrease in brain Abeta deposition and tau phosphorylation. PRGF-Endoret-treated APP/PS1 mice also showed decreased astrocyte reactivity, and prevented protein synaptic loss. In vitro approaches demonstrated that PRGF-Endoret treatment modulated astrocyte activation, reducing inflammatory responses, and promoted Abeta degradation. Furthermore, PRGF-Endoret stimulated global improvements in anxiety, learning, and memory behaviors. Our findings show that PRGF-Endoret exerts multifunctional and complementary effects that result in the reversal of the broad range of cognitive deficits in AD, suggesting that PRGF-Endoret may hold promise as an innovative therapy in AD.
