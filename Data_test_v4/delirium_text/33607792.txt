33607792|a|PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the potential beneficial effects of periarticular injection (PAI) of multimodal drugs on the inflammatory response and joint function after hip arthroplasty in elderly patients with osteoporotic femoral neck fractures. METHODS: Fifty six elderly patients with unilateral osteoporotic femoral neck fractures were randomly allocated to 2 groups: the PAI group, which received the multimodal drug PAI intraoperatively before incision closure, and the control group, which received an injection of saline at the same time as placebo. The C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), and IL-6 levels as well as the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) in peripheral venous blood samples were measured, along with the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score with activity and Harris hip score preoperation at 1, 2, 4, 7, and 14 days as well as 1 and 3 months post-operation. RESULTS: The 2 groups were comparable in sex and age, and no significant differences were observed in the preoperative CRP, IL-1beta, and IL-6 levels, ESR, VAS score, or Harris hip score between the 2 groups (all P > .05). However, during the postoperative period, the PAI group exhibited significantly lower levels of CRP, IL-1beta, and IL-6 as well as a lower ERS and VAS score compared with the control group (P < .05), while the Harris hip score was significantly higher postoperatively in the PAI group (P < .05). CONCLUSION: Multimodal drug PAI can alleviate the inflammatory response and enhance hip function recovery after hip arthroplasty in elderly patients with osteoporotic femoral neck fractures.
