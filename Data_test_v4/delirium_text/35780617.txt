35780617|a|The expeditious advancement of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a threat to the global healthcare system, that is further supplemented by therapeutic failure. The prevalence of this disorder has been expected to quadrupole by 2050, thereby exerting a tremendous economic pressure on medical sector, worldwide. Thus, there is a dire need of a change in conventional approaches and adopt a novel methodology of disease prevention, treatment and diagnosis. Precision medicine offers a personalized approach to disease management, It is dependent upon genetic, environmental and lifestyle factors associated with the individual, aiding to develop tailored therapeutics. Precision Medicine Initiatives are launched, worldwide, to facilitate the integration of personalized models and clinical medicine. The review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the neuroinflammatory processes causing AD, giving a brief overview of the disease interventions. This is further followed by the role of precision medicine in AD, constituting the genetic perspectives, operation of personalized form of medicine and optimization of clinical trials with the 3 R's, showcasing an in-depth understanding of this novel approach in varying aspects of the healthcare industry, to provide an opportunity to the global AD researchers to elucidate suitable therapeutic regimens in clinically and pathologically complex diseases, like AD.
