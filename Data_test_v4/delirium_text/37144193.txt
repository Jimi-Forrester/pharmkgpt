37144193|a|Background: Liver diseases are a spectrum of diseases that include hepatic steatosis, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, hepatitis, liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatic cancer. These diseases not only severely decrease the quality of life for patients, but also cause financial burden. Although apigenin (APG) has recently become the primary treatment for liver injuries and diseases (LIADs), there has been no systematic review of its use. Purpose: To review the existing literature and put forward novel strategies for future APG research on LIADs. Methods: A search was conducted in PubMed, Science Direct, Research Gate, Web of Science, VIP, Wanfang, and CNKI, and 809 articles were obtained. After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 135 articles were included. Results: APG is promising in treating LIADs via various mechanisms arising from its anti-inflammation, anti-proliferation, anti-infection, anti-oxidation, and anti-cancer properties. Conclusion: This review summarizes the evidence supporting the use of APG as a treatment for LIADs and provides an insight into the intestinal microbiota, which may have important implications in its future clinical use.
