35890730|t|Formulation and In Vitro Characterization of a Vacuum-Dried Drug-Polymer Thin Film for Intranasal Application.
35890730|a|Intranasal drug applications show significant therapeutic potential for diverse pharmaceutical modalities. Because the formulation applied to the nasal cavity is discharged to the pharyngeal side by mucociliary clearance, the formulation should be dissolved effectively in a limited amount of mucus within its retention time in the nasal cavity. In this study, to develop novel formulations with improved dissolution behavior and compatibility with the intranasal environment, a thin-film formulation including drug and polymer was prepared using a vacuum-drying method. The poorly water-soluble drugs ketoprofen, flurbiprofen, ibuprofen, and loxoprofen were dissolved in a solvent comprising water and methanol, and evaporated to obtain a thin film. Physical analyses using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), powder X-ray diffraction analysis (PXRD), and scanning electron microscopy SEM revealed that the formulations were amorphized in the film. The dissolution behavior of the drugs was investigated using an in vitro evaluation system that mimicked the intranasal physiological environment. The amorphization of drugs formulated with polymers into thin films using the vacuum-drying method improved the dissolution rate in artificial nasal fluid. Therefore, the thin film developed in this study can be safely and effectively used for intranasal drug application.
