34355254|t|Accurate characterization of beta-amyloid (Abeta40, Abeta42) standards using species-specific isotope dilution by means of HPLC-ICP-MS/MS.
34355254|a|The amyloid beta peptide, as one of the main components in senile plaque, represents a defining pathological feature for Alzheimer's disease, and is therefore commonly used as a biomarker for this disease in clinical analysis. However, the selection of suitable standards is limited here, since only a few are commercially available, and these suffer from varying purity. Hence, the accurate characterization of these standards is of great importance. In this study, we developed a method for the traceable quantification of the peptide content using species-specific isotope dilution and ICP-MS/MS detection. It is based on the separation of the sulfur-containing amino acids methionine and cysteine after oxidation and hydrolysis of the peptide. Using a strong anion exchange column, both amino acids could be separated from each other, as well as from their oxidized forms and sulfate. The sulfur content was determined via ICP-MS/MS using oxygen as reaction gas. Species-specific isotope dilution was enabled by using a 34S-labeled yeast hydrolysate, containing methionine sulfone and cysteic acid with different isotopic composition. The peptide contents of Abeta standards (Abeta40,42), as well as myoglobin and lysozyme with different degrees of purity, were determined. For validation purposes, the standard reference material NIST 2389a, which contains the amino acids in a similar concentration, was subjected to the developed sample preparation and analysis method. In addition to accounting for errors during sample preparation, high levels of accuracy and precision could be obtained using this method, making it fit-for-purpose for the characterization of peptide standards.
