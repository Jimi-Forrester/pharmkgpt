35577342|a|OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to analyze various risk factors that can cause postoperative delirium (POD) in degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) patients, which may affect normal recovery and outcomes after surgery, and to help deal with them in advance and to take a medical approach. METHODS: A total of 148 patients aged 60 years or older who underwent laminoplasty or anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) for DCM from 2008 to 2015 were included in this study. Incidence and multiple risk factors for development of POD were analyzed. RESULTS: POD occurred in 24 patients (16.2%). Among the 148 patients, 78 received laminoplasty, of whom 19 patients (24%) experienced delirium; the other 70 patients underwent ACDF, of whom 5 patients (7.1%) experienced delirium. History of Parkinson disease (odds ratio [OR], 178.242; p = 0.015), potassium level (OR, 3.764; p = 0.031), and surgical approach of laminoplasty over ACDF (OR, 8.538; p = 0.008) were found to be significant risk factors in a multivariate analysis. Age (OR, 1.056; p = 0.04) and potassium level (OR, 3.217; p = 0.04) were significant risk factors in the laminoplasty group. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study suggest that the incidence and risk factors for POD may vary in patients with DCM. It is necessary to understand multiple factors that affect the development of POD.
