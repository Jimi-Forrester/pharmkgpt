35089980|a|Black soybeans contain several bioactive compounds and commonly consumed due to their health-related activities but rarely cultivated as edible sprouts. The present study investigated the changes that occurred during germination in two new genotypes black soybeans. Raw and germinated seeds were tested against in vitro Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers, including oxidative stress, inflammatory factors and cholinesterase enzymes as well as gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels. Sprouts significantly inhibited the cholinesterase enzymes and inflammatory factors (protein denaturation, proteinase and lipoxygenase) than seeds. An increase in phenolic, flavonoid and GABA (10-folds) content and antioxidant capacity (ABTS, DPPH, and FRAP) was observed in germinated seeds. However, anthocyanin content was decreased in sprouts. UHPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS2 metabolites profiling approach identified 22 compounds including amino acids, peptides, fatty acids, and polyphenols. Among identified compounds, daidzein, genistein, gallic acid, spermidine, L-asparagine, and L-lysine exhibited the highest increase after germination. The current study reveals that germination of black soybeans have promising potential to inhibit/prevent AD and can be used to develop functional foods.
