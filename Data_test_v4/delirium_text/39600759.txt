39600759|t|Acute Toxicity With Lactic Acidosis Associated With Cannabinoid Gummies.
39600759|a|The use of marijuana and cannabinoids is widespread throughout the United States, and these drugs can cause both acute and chronic medical disorders. The ingestion of edible products with uncertain content can cause accidental toxicity. The patient described in this case report ingested a large number of edible cannabinoid gummies. He developed a sequence of toxic states that included lethargy, agitation, vomiting, tachycardia, hypertension, acute respiratory failure, and elevated lactic acid levels. These clinical syndromes resolved over the next 24 hours with supportive intensive care unit management. The medical literature indicates that cannabis toxicity can cause acute lactic acidosis in some patients. This possibility needs to be considered when patients present to the emergency room with hypertension, tachycardia, and lactic acidosis.
