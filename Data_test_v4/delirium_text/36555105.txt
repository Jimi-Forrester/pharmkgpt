36555105|t|Sterol O-Acyltransferase Inhibition Ameliorates High-Fat Diet-Induced Renal Fibrosis and Tertiary Lymphoid Tissue Maturation after Ischemic Reperfusion Injury.
36555105|a|Metabolic syndrome is associated with the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD). We previously demonstrated that aged kidneys are prone to developing tertiary lymphoid tissues (TLTs) and sustain inflammation after injury, leading to CKD progression; however, the relationship between renal TLT and metabolic syndrome is unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that a high-fat diet (HFD) promoted renal TLT formation and inflammation via sterol O-acyltransferase (SOAT) 1-dependent mechanism. Mice fed a HFD prior to ischemic reperfusion injury (IRI) exhibited pronounced renal TLT formation and sustained inflammation compared to the controls. Untargeted lipidomics revealed the increased levels of cholesteryl esters (CEs) in aged kidneys with TLT formation after IRI, and, consistently, the Soat1 gene expression increased. Treatment with avasimibe, a SOAT inhibitor, attenuated TLT maturation and renal inflammation in HFD-fed mice subjected to IRI. Our findings suggest the importance of SOAT1-dependent CE accumulation in the pathophysiology of CKDs associated with TLT.
