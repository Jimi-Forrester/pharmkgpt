34792731|t|Carrying Excess Baggage Can Slowdown Life: Protein Clearance Machineries That Go Awry During Aging and the Relevance of Maintaining Them.
34792731|a|Cellular homeostasis is maintained by rapid and systematic cleansing of aberrant and aggregated proteins within cells. Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) especially Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease are known to be associated with multiple factors, most important being impaired clearance of aggregates, resulting in the accumulation of specific aggregated protein in the brain. Protein quality control (PQC) of proteostasis network comprises proteolytic machineries and chaperones along with their regulators to ensure precise operation and maintenance of proteostasis. Such regulatory factors coordinate among each other multiple functional aspects related to proteins, including their synthesis, folding, transport, and degradation. During aging due to inevitable endogenous and external stresses, sustaining a proteome balance is a challenging task. Such stresses decline the capacity of the proteostasis network compromising the proteome integrity, affecting the fundamental physiological processes including reproductive fitness of the organism. This review focuses on highlighting proteome-wide changes during aging and the strategies for proteostasis improvements. The possibility of augmenting the proteostasis network either via genetic or pharmacological interventions may be a promising strategy towards delaying age-associated pathological consequences due to proteome disbalance, thus promoting healthy aging and prolonged longevity.
