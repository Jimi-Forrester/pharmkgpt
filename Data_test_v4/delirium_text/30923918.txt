30923918|t|Association study and a systematic meta-analysis of the VNTR polymorphism in the 3'-UTR of dopamine transporter gene and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.
30923918|a|Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has been postulated to associate with dopaminergic dysfunction, including the dopamine transporter (DAT1). Several meta-analyses showed small but significant association between the 10-repeat allele in the DAT1 gene in 3'-untranslated region variant number tandem repeat polymorphism and child and adolescent ADHD, whereas in adult ADHD the 9-repeat allele was suggested to confer as risk allele. Interestingly, recent evidence indicated that the long-allele variants (10 repeats and longer) might confer to lower expression of the transporter in comparison to the short-allele. Therefore, we assessed here the association in samples consisting of families with child and adolescent ADHD as well as a case-control sample, using either the 10- versus 9-repeat or the long- versus short-allele approach. Following, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis, including family and case-control studies, using the two aforementioned approaches as well as stratifying to age and ethnicity. The first approach (10-repeat) resulted in nominal significant association in child and adolescent ADHD (OR 1.1050 p = 0.0128), that became significant stratifying to European population (OR 1.1301 p = 0.0085). The second approach (long-allele) resulted in significant association with the whole ADHD population (OR 1.1046 p = 0.0048), followed by significant association for child and adolescent ADHD (OR 1.1602 p = 0.0006) and in Caucasian and in European child and adolescent ADHD (OR 1.1310 p = 0.0114; OR 1.1661 p = 0.0061; respectively). We were not able to confirm the association reported in adults using both approaches. In conclusion, we found further indication for a possible DAT1 gene involvement; however, further studies should be conducted with stringent phenotyping to reduce heterogeneity, a limitation observed in most included studies.
