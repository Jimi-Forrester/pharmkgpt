37066216|a|Brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( Bdnf ) plays a critical role in brain development, dendritic growth, synaptic plasticity, as well as learning and memory. The rodent Bdnf gene contains nine 5' non-coding exons ( I-IXa ), which are spliced to a common 3' coding exon ( IX ). Transcription of individual Bdnf variants, which all encode the same BDNF protein, is initiated at unique promoters upstream of each non-coding exon, enabling precise spatiotemporal and activity-dependent regulation of Bdnf expression. Although prior evidence suggests that Bdnf transcripts containing exon I ( Bdnf I ) or exon IV ( Bdnf IV ) are uniquely regulated by neuronal activity, the functional significance of different Bdnf transcript variants remains unclear. To investigate functional roles of activity-dependent Bdnf I and IV transcripts, we used a CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) system in which catalytically-dead Cas9 (dCas9) fused to a transcriptional activator (VPR) is targeted to individual Bdnf promoters with single guide RNAs (sgRNAs), resulting in transcript-specific Bdnf upregulation. Bdnf I upregulation is associated with gene expression changes linked to dendritic growth, while Bdnf IV upregulation is associated with genes that regulate protein catabolism. Upregulation of Bdnf I , but not Bdnf IV , increased mushroom spine density, volume, length, and head diameter, and also produced more complex dendritic arbors in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. In contrast, upregulation of Bdnf IV , but not Bdnf I , in the rat hippocampus attenuated contextual fear expression. Our data suggest that while Bdnf I and IV are both activity-dependent, BDNF produced from these promoters may serve unique cellular, synaptic, and behavioral functions.
