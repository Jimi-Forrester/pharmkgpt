36870467|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that affects several elderly people per years. AD is a pathology of multifactorial etiology, resulting from multiple environmental and genetic determinants. However, there is no effective pharmacological alternative for the treatment of this illness. In this sense, the purpose of current study was to characterize the mechanisms by which Abeta1-42 injection via intracerebroventricular induces neurobehavioral changes in a time-course curve. In addition, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) inhibitor of histone deacetylase (HDAC) was used to investigate the involvement of epigenetic modifications Abeta1-42-caused in aged female mice. In general manner, Abeta1-42 injection induced a major neurochemical disturbance in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of animals and a serious impairment of memory. Overall, SAHA treatment attenuated neurobehavioral changes caused by Abeta1-42 injection in aged female mice. The subchronic effects presented of SAHA were through modulation of HDAC activity, regulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels and expression of BDNF mRNA, accompanied by unlocking cAMP/PKA/pCREB pathway in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of animals.
