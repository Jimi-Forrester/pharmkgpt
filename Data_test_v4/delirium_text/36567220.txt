36567220|t|Independent External Validation of a Preoperative Prediction Model for Delirium After Cardiac Surgery: A Prospective Observational Cohort Study.
36567220|a|OBJECTIVE: This investigation provided independent external validation of an existing preoperative risk prediction model. DESIGN: A prospective observational cohort study of patients undergoing cardiac surgery covering the period between April 16, 2018 and January 18, 2022. SETTING: Two academic hospitals in Switzerland. PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients (>=60 years of age) who underwent elective cardiac surgery, including coronary artery bypass graft, mitral or aortic valve replacement or repair, and combined procedures. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The primary outcome measure was the incidence of postoperative delirium (POD) in the intensive or intermediate care unit, diagnosed using the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist. The prediction model contained 4 preoperative risk factors to which the following points were assigned: Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score <=23 received 2 points; MMSE 24-27, Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) >4, prior stroke and/or transient ischemic attack (TIA), and abnormal serum albumin (<=3.5 or >=4.5 g/dL) received 1 point each. The missing data were handled using multiple imputation. In total, 348 patients were included in the study. Sixty patients (17.4%) developed POD. For point levels in the prediction model of 0, 1, 2, and >=3, the cumulative incidence of POD was 12.6%, 22.8%, 25.8%, and 35%, respectively. The validation resulted in a pooled area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of 0.60 (median CI, 0.525-0.679). CONCLUSIONS: The evaluated predictive model for delirium after cardiac surgery in this patient cohort showed only poor discriminative capacity but fair calibration.
