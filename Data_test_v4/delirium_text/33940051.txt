33940051|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) represents a state of cognitive function between normal cognition and dementia. Longitudinal studies showed that some MCI patients remained in a state of MCI, and some developed AD. The reason for these different conversions from MCI remains to be investigated. 180 MCI participants were followed for eight years. 143 MCI patients maintained the MCI state (MCI_S), and the remaining thirty-seven MCI patients were re-evaluated as having AD (MCI_AD). We obtained 1,036 structural brain characteristics and 15,481 gene expression values from the 180 MCI participants and applied weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to explore the relationship between structural brain features and gene expression. Regulating mediator effect analysis was employed to explore the relationships among gene expression, brain region measurements and clinical phenotypes. We found that 60 genes from the MCI_S group and 18 genes from the MCI_AD group respectively had the most significant correlations with left paracentral lobule and sulcus (L.PTS) and right subparietal sulcus (R.SubPS) thickness; CTCF, UQCR11 and WDR5B were the mutual genes between the two groups. The expression of CTCF gene and clinical score are completely mediated by L.PTS thickness, and the UQCR11 and WDR5B gene expression levels significantly regulate the mediating effect pathway. In conclusion, the factors affecting the different conversions from MCI are closely related to L.PTS thickness and the CTCF, UQCR11 and WDR5B gene expression levels. Our results add a theoretical foundation of imaging genetics for conversion from MCI to AD.
