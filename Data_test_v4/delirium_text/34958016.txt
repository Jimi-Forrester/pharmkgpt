34958016|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD), with cognitive impairment as the main clinical manifestation, is a progressive neurodegenerative disease. The assembly of amyloid-beta (Abeta) as senile plaques is one of the most well-known histopathological alterations in AD. Several studies reported that cognitive training reduced Abeta deposition and delayed memory loss. However, the long-term benefits of spatial training and the underlying neurobiological mechanisms have not yet been elucidated. OBJECTIVE: To explore the long-term effects of spatial training on AD-related pathogenic processes in APP/PS1 mice. METHODS: We used Morris water maze (MWM), Open Field, Barnes Maze, western blotting, qPCR, and immunofluorescence. RESULTS: One-month MWM training in APP/PS1 mice at 2.5 months of age could attenuate Abeta deposition and decrease the expression of beta-secretase (BACE1) and amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP) with long-term effects. Simultaneously, regular spatial training increased the expression of synapse-related proteins in the hippocampus. Moreover, MWM training increased adult hippocampal neurogenesis in AD model mice. Nonetheless, cognitive deficits in APP/PS1 transgenic mice at 7 months of age were not attenuated by MWM training at an early stage. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that MWM training alleviates amyloid plaque burden and adult hippocampal neurogenesis deficits with long-term effects in AD model mice.
