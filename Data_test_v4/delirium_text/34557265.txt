34557265|a|Autophagy is an essential cellular process that involves the transport of cytoplasmic content in double-membraned vesicles to lysosomes for degradation. Neurons do not undergo cytokinesis, and thus, the cell division process cannot reduce levels of unnecessary proteins. The primary cause of neurodegenerative disorders (NDs) is the abnormal deposition of proteins inside neuronal cells, and this could be averted by autophagic degradation. Thus, autophagy is an important consideration when considering means of developing treatments for NDs. Various pharmacological studies have reported that the active components in herbal medicines exhibit therapeutic benefits in NDs, for example, by inhibiting cholinesterase activity and modulating amyloid beta levels, and alpha-synuclein metabolism. A variety of bioactive constituents from medicinal plants are viewed as promising autophagy controllers and are revealed to recover the NDs by targeting the autophagic pathway. In the present review, we discuss the role of autophagy in the therapeutic management of several NDs. The molecular process responsible for autophagy and its importance in various NDs and the beneficial effects of medicinal plants in NDs by targeting autophagy are also discussed.
