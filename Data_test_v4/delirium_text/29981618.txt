29981618|t|Delirium in Postoperative Patients Admitted to the Intensive Care Unit.
29981618|a|Postoperative delirium (POD) is common among surgical patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and is associated with increased resource utilization, morbidity, and death. Our primary aim was to compare rates of POD using administrative International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, records and automated interrogation of electronic health records from Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU) screening. The secondary aim was to assess POD risk associated with patient and perioperative characteristics. Electronic health records of surgical patients admitted to the ICU during 2011 through 2014 were abstracted for POD assessment by CAM-ICU and by administrative codes, Charlson comorbidity index, surgical characteristics, and Acute Physiology, Age, Chronic Health Evaluation III scores. Of 6338 patients, CAM-ICU identified 606 (9.6%) and administrative records identified 55 (0.9%) POD cases, with agreement on 50 cases. In multivariable logistic regression based on POD identified with CAM-ICU, preexisting dementia had the strongest association with POD (odds ratio [95% confidence interval], 6.47 [3.68-11.37]; P < 0.001). Other associations found were older age, congestive heart failure, chronic pulmonary disease, increased surgical duration, emergency cases, blood transfusions, postoperative ventilation, and higher Acute Physiology, Age, Chronic Health Evaluation III scores (all P <= 0.01). POD cases had lengthier ICU and hospital stays and a higher mortality rate (all P < 0.001). CAM-ICU scores identified higher rates of POD than a search for POD based on administrative codes. Preoperative presence of dementia and major comorbidities were associated with POD. Delirium in surgical patients is associated with worse outcomes.
