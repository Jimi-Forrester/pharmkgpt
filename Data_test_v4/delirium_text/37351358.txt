37351358|t|Pseudo-infarction electrocardiographic changes in delayed onset hypoparathyroidism: A case report.
37351358|a|Key Clinical Message: The high-risk "Shark Fin" electrocardiogram (ECG) pattern has been associated with transmural ischemia but can also result from electrolyte anomalies. Therefore, the decision for invasive coronary catheterization requires a detailed history and dedicated biochemical tests. Abstract: Pseudo-infarction ECG pattern resembling "Shark Fin" was demonstrated in a 76-year-old lady with a previous total thyroidectomy who presented with unspecific symptoms. An incidental finding of hypokalemia and hypocalcemia was thought to be related to delayed onset hypoparathyroidism. Potential etiologies like coronary vasospasm and catecholamine-associated myocardial injury were suggested.
