33430178|t|Association between ApoE epsilon4 Carrier Status and Cardiovascular Risk Factors on Mild Cognitive Impairment among Mexican Older Adults.
33430178|a|Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (amnestic or non-amnestic) has different clinical and neuropsychological characteristics, and its evolution is heterogeneous. Cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF), such as hypertension, diabetes, or dyslipidemia, and the presence of the Apolipoprotein E epsilon4 (ApoE epsilon4) polymorphism have been associated with an increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other dementias but the relationship is inconsistent worldwide. We aimed to establish the association between the ApoE epsilon4 carrier status and CVRF on MCI subtypes (amnestic and non-amnestic) in Mexican older adults. Cross-sectional study including 137 older adults (n = 63 with normal cognition (NC), n = 24 with amnesic, and n = 50 with non-amnesic MCI). Multinomial logistic regression models were performed in order to determine the association between ApoE epsilon4 polymorphism carrier and CVRF on amnestic and non-amnestic-MCI. ApoE epsilon4 carrier status was present in 28.8% participants. The models showed that ApoE epsilon4 carrier status was not associated neither aMCI nor naMCI condition. The interaction term ApoE epsilon4 x CVRF was not statistically significant for both types of MCI. However, CVRF were associated with both types of MCI and the association remained statistically significant after adjustment by sex, age, and education level. The carrier status of the ApoE genotype does not contribute to this risk.
