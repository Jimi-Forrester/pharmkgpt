36311343|a|INTRODUCTION: End-of-life care is one of the most crucial experiences for both the patient and their loved ones. However, as a result of the changes generated by the COVID 19 pandemic, the dynamics of the end-of-life process has undergone changes at both the family, social and health levels. In turn, this has altered the perception and development of the grief of relatives of patients who died during the pandemic regardless of the cause of death. Then, the aim of this study is to analyze the perceptions and some aspects of bereavement of died patients` relatives during the pandemic of Covid 19. METHODS: Through the admission evaluation and follow-up of the relatives with an adapted version of the international Care Of the Dying Evaluation (iCODE) questionnaire. RESULTS: 239 relatives were surveyed, of which 112 completed the follow-up questionnaire. Most of the patients died at home and their family members were highly involved in their care. Medical attention was considered adequate and the symptom with the highest perception was pain. 87% of those surveyed participated in funeral rites, and 42% rated them as very sober. Regarding grief, the scale of personal growth predominates, however, in the negative aspects, the feeling of pressure in the chest and frequent crying predominates. CONCLUSIONS: The end of life of home-care patients during the pandemic was perceived as adequate, allowing family support and symptom control. The grieving process shows no complications. The training of health professionals in these fundamental aspects of patient care is important.
