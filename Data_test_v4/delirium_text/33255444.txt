33255444|t|Effect of Ionic Strength on Thioflavin-T Affinity to Amyloid Fibrils and Its Fluorescence Intensity.
33255444|a|The formation of amyloid fibrils is linked to multiple neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. Despite years of research and countless studies on the topic of such aggregate formation, as well as their resulting structure, the current knowledge is still fairly limited. One of the main aspects prohibiting effective aggregation tracking is the environment's effect on amyloid-specific dyes, namely thioflavin-T (ThT). Currently, there are only a few studies hinting at ionic strength being one of the factors that modulate the dye's binding affinity and fluorescence intensity. In this work we explore this effect under a range of ionic strength conditions, using insulin, lysozyme, mouse prion protein, and alpha-synuclein fibrils. We show that ionic strength is an extremely important factor affecting both the binding affinity, as well as the fluorescence intensity of ThT.
