30213973|a|Maternal smoking during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of developmental, behavioral, and cognitive deficits. Nicotine, the primary addictive component in tobacco, has been shown to modulate changes in gene expression when exposure occurs during neurodevelopment. The ventral tegmental area (VTA) is believed to be central to the mechanism of addiction because of its involvement in the reward pathway. The purpose of this study was to build a genetic profile for dopamine (DA) neurons in the VTA and investigate the disruptions to the molecular pathways after perinatal nicotine exposure. Initially, we isolated the VTA from rat pups treated perinatally with either nicotine or saline (control) and collected DA neurons using fluorescent-activated cell sorting. Using microarray analysis, we profiled the differential expression of mRNAs and microRNAs from DA neurons in the VTA in order to explore potential points of regulation and enriched pathways following perinatal nicotine exposure. Furthermore, mechanisms of miRNA-mediated post-transcriptional regulation were investigated using predicted and validated miRNA-gene targets in order to demonstrate the role of miRNAs in the mesocorticolimbic DA pathway. This study provides insight into the genetic profile as well as biological pathways of DA neurons in the VTA of rats following perinatal nicotine exposure.
