33401729|a|In the last few decades, development of novel experimental techniques, such as new types of disulfide (SS)-forming reagents and genetic and chemical technologies for synthesizing designed artificial proteins, is opening a new realm of the oxidative folding study where peptides and proteins can be folded under physiologically more relevant conditions. In this review, after a brief overview of the historical and physicochemical background of oxidative protein folding study, recently revealed folding pathways of several representative peptides and proteins are summarized, including those having two, three, or four SS bonds in the native state, as well as those with odd Cys residues or consisting of two peptide chains. Comparison of the updated pathways with those reported in the early years has revealed the flexible nature of the protein folding pathways. The significantly different pathways characterized for hen-egg white lysozyme and bovine milk alpha-lactalbumin, which belong to the same protein superfamily, suggest that the information of protein folding pathways, not only the native folded structure, is encoded in the amino acid sequence. The application of the flexible pathways of peptides and proteins to the engineering of folded three-dimensional structures is an interesting and important issue in the new realm of the current oxidative protein folding study.
