36272444|t|Rehabilitation of Neuropsychiatric Symptoms in Patients With Long COVID: Position Statement.
36272444|a|Long COVID, a term used to describe ongoing symptoms after COVID-19 infection, parallels the course of other postviral syndromes. Neuropsychiatric symptoms of long COVID can be persistent and interfere with quality of life and functioning. Within the biopsychosocial framework of chronic illness, rehabilitation professionals can address the neuropsychiatric sequelae of long COVID. However, current practice models are not designed to address concurrent psychiatric and cognitive symptoms in adults living with long COVID. Thus, we present a biopsychosocial framework for long COVID and provide treatment strategies based on evidence from current literature of postviral chronic illness. These recommendations will guide rehabilitation professionals in identifying common neuropsychiatric symptoms in long COVID that can be targeted for intervention and addressing these symptoms via integrative interventions taking into account the biopsychosocial presentation of long COVID symptoms.
