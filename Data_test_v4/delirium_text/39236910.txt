39236910|a|Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is a pituitary hormone that stimulates the thyroid gland to produce and release thyroid hormones, primarily thyroxine and triiodothyronine. These hormones are key players in body-brain communication, influencing various physiological processes, including the regulation of metabolism (both peripheral and central effects), feedback mechanisms, and lipid metabolism. Recently, the increasing incidence of abnormal lipid metabolism has highlighted the link between thyroid function and lipid metabolism. Evidence suggests that TSH can affect all bodily systems through body-brain communication, playing a crucial role in growth, development, and the regulation of various physiological systems. Lipids serve dual purposes: they are involved in energy storage and metabolism, and they act as vital signaling molecules in numerous cellular activities, maintaining overall human health or contributing to various diseases. This article reviews the role of TSH in regulating lipid metabolism via body-brain crosstalk, focusing on its implications for common lipid metabolism disorders such as obesity, atherosclerosis, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, neuropsychiatric disorders (including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, and depression), and cerebrovascular disorders such as stroke.
