36899015|a|Neurofilament light chains (NfL) are neuron-specific cytoskeletal proteins whose plasmatic concentrations have been explored as a clinically useful marker in several types of dementia. Plasma concentrations of NfL are extremely low, and just two assays are commercially available for their study: one based on the SiMoA technology and one based on Ella. We thus studied plasma levels of NfL with both platforms to check the correlation between them and to assess their potential in the diagnosis of neurodegeneration. Plasma NfL levels were measured on 50 subjects: 18 healthy controls, 20 Alzheimer's disease, and 12 frontotemporal dementia patients. Ella returned plasmatic NfL levels significantly higher than SiMoA, however the results were strongly correlated (r = 0.94), and a proportional coefficient of 0.58 between the two assays was calculated. Both assays detected higher plasma NfL levels in patients with dementia than in the control group (p < 0.0001) and allowed their discrimination with excellent diagnostic performance (AUC > 0.95). No difference was found between Alzheimer's and Frontotemporal dementia either using SiMoA or Ella. In conclusion, both the analytical platforms resulted effective in analysing plasma levels of NfL. However, the correct interpretation of results requires the precise knowledge of the assay used.
