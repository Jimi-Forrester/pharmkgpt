39117915|a|In Europe, CRC is the second most common cause of cancer death, and surgery remains the mainstay curative treatment. Age and frailty are associated with an increased risk of postoperative morbidity and 1-year mortality. Chronological age is not sufficient to assess the risk of postoperative complications. The CGA has been developed to better identify frail patients. Geriatric co-management have been developed to optimize the post-operative outcomes. We analyzed the real-life of geriatric co-management within an ERAS program on surgical outcomes at 90 days and oncologic outcomes at 1 year in patients aged 70 years or older after surgery for CRC. This was a retrospective study based on a prospective cohort. Fifty-one patients with a G8 score <= 14 were referred to geriatricians for preoperative CGA (Frail Group). They were compared with 151 patients with a G8 score >= 15 (Robust Group). In the Frail Group, patients were significantly older with more comorbidities than the patients in the Robust Group. Oncologic characteristics, treatments and global post-operative outcomes were comparable between the two groups. One year after surgery mortality and recurrence rates were similar between the two groups. Our study suggests that geriatric co-management is feasible and contributes to the reduction of postoperative morbimortality. Moreover, performing the CGA after G8 score screening and completion of geriatric interventions resulted in similar 90-day postoperative outcomes, in frail patients than in robust patients. Our results confirmed the benefit of geriatric co-management, involving G8 screening, CGA, and ERAS, for frail older patients undergoing surgery for CRC.
