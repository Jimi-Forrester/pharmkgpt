34572132|t|Mitochondrial DNA Haplogroup Related to the Prevalence of Helicobacter pylori.
34572132|a|Mitochondria are essential organelles that are not only responsible for energy production but are also involved in cell metabolism, calcium homeostasis, and apoptosis. Targeting mitochondria is a key strategy for bacteria to subvert host cells' physiology and promote infection. Helicobacter (H.) pylori targets mitochondria directly. However, mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) polymorphism (haplogroup) is not yet considered an important factor for H. pylori infection. Here, we clarified the association of mitochondrial haplogroups with H. pylori prevalence and the ability to perform damage. Seven mtDNA haplogroups were identified among 28 H. pylori-positive subjects. Haplogroup B was present at a higher frequency and haplotype D at a lower one in the H. pylori population than in that of the H. pylori-negative one. The fibroblasts carrying high-frequency haplogroup displayed a higher apoptotic rate and diminished mitochondrial respiration following H. pylori infection. mtDNA mutations were accumulated more in the H. pylori-positive population than in that of the H. pylori-negative one in old age. Among the mutations, 57% were located in RNA genes or nonsynonymous protein-coding regions in the H. pylori-positive population, while 35% were in the H. pylori-negative one. We concluded that gastric disease caused by Helicobacter virulence could be associated with haplogroups and mtDNA mutations.
