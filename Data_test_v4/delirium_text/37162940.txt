37162940|a|Spouses of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients are at higher risk of developing AD dementia, but the reasons and underlying mechanism are unknown. One potential factor is gut microbiota dysbiosis, which has been associated with AD. However, it remains unclear whether the gut microbiota dysbiosis can be transmitted to non-AD individuals and contribute to the development of AD pathogenesis and cognitive impairment. The present study found that co-housing wild-type mice with AD transgenic mice or giving them AD transgenic mice feces caused AD-associated gut microbiota dysbiosis, Tau phosphorylation, and cognitive impairment. Gavage with Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium restored these changes. The oral and gut microbiota of AD patient partners resembled that of AD patients but differed from healthy controls, indicating the transmission of oral and gut microbiota and its impact on cognitive function. The underlying mechanism of these findings includes that the butyric acid-mediated acetylation of GSK3beta at lysine 15 regulated its phosphorylation at serine 9, consequently impacting Tau phosphorylation. These results provide insight into a potential link between gut microbiota dysbiosis and AD and underscore the need for further research in this area.
