35530901|t|Boerhaave's Syndrome: A Case Report.
35530901|a|Boerhaave's syndrome is a rare spontaneous perforation of the esophagus with high mortality. The diagnosis is difficult because it has no specific symptom. It requires urgent intervention. We report the case of a 63-year-old male admitted to the emergency department with respiratory distress. Chest computed tomography (CT) revealed large, bilateral, and tension hydropneumothorax, stomach distention, and aerobilia. Thoracic drainage was performed immediately. Control CT revealed esophagus perforation in the middle third of the esophagus with extravasation of the contrast product from the esophagus to the pleura. Urgent surgery was performed, and the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with septic shock. Early diagnosis and management with a damage control approach including thoracic drainage and surgery are essential to improve prognosis and reduce mortality.
