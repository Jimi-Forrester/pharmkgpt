25138632|t|Intoxication by angel's trumpet: case report and literature review.
25138632|a|BACKGROUND: Brugmansia, commonly referred to as angel's trumpet (AT), has been become popular in Korea as an ornamental shrub. However, it is not generally known by the public that this plant contains tropane alkaloids, and that ingestion of AT can lead to anticholinergic poisoning. CASE PRESENTATION: A 64-year-old Korean female presented with acute mental changes caused by inadvertent ingestion of the petals of AT flowers used as a garnish in a traditional Korean food (bibimbop). She regained her usual level of awareness after 10 hours. CONCLUSION: Considering its easy availability, the toxicity of AT should be addressed to prevent accidental and intentional poisoning by this ornamental plant.
