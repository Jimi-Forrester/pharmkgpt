36826468|t|Identification of Chromatin Regulatory Factors Related to Immunity and Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease.
36826468|a|Alzheimer's disease is one of the common neurodegenerative diseases in the elderly, which mainly manifests as progressively severe cognitive impairment, which seriously affects the quality of life of patients. Chromatin regulators have been shown to be associated with a variety of biological processes, and we mainly explore the relationship between chromatin regulators and Alzheimer's disease. Eight hundred seventy chromatin regulators were collected from previous studies, and data related to Alzheimer's disease patients were downloaded from the GEO database. Finally, we screened chromatin regulators related to Alzheimer's disease immunity, established prediction models, and screened related drugs and miRNAs. We screened 160 differentially expressed CRs, constructed an interaction network, obtained 10 hub genes, successfully constructed a prediction model based on immune-related 5 CRs, and obtained 520 related drugs and 3 related miRNA, which provided an idea for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Our study identified 5 chromatin regulators related to Alzheimer's disease, which are expected to be new targets for Alzheimer's disease immunotherapy.
