37023330|t|Molecular Mechanisms of Amyloid-beta Self-Assembly Seeded by In Vivo-Derived Fibrils and Inhibitory Effects of the BRICHOS Chaperone.
37023330|a|Self-replication of amyloid-beta-peptide (Abeta) fibril formation is a hallmark in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Detailed insights have been obtained in Abeta self-assembly in vitro, yet whether similar mechanisms are relevant in vivo has remained elusive. Here, we investigated the ability of in vivo-derived Abeta fibrils from two different amyloid precursor protein knock-in AD mouse models to seed Abeta42 aggregation, where we quantified the microscopic rate constants. We found that the nucleation mechanism of in vivo-derived fibril-seeded Abeta42 aggregation can be described with the same kinetic model as that in vitro. Further, we identified the inhibitory mechanism of the anti-amyloid BRICHOS chaperone on seeded Abeta42 fibrillization, revealing a suppression of secondary nucleation and fibril elongation, which is strikingly similar as observed in vitro. These findings hence provide a molecular understanding of the Abeta42 nucleation process triggered by in vivo-derived Abeta42 propagons, providing a framework for the search for new AD therapeutics.
