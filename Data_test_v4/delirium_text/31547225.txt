31547225|t|Heat Shock Proteins and Inflammasomes.
31547225|a|Heat shock proteins (HSP) regulate inflammation in many physiological contexts. However, inflammation is a broad process, involving numerous cytokines produced by different molecular pathways with multiple functions. In this review, we focused on the particular role of HSP on the inflammasomes intracellular platforms activated by danger signals and that enable activation of inflammatory caspases, mainly caspase-1, leading to the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1beta. Interestingly, some members of the HSP family favor inflammasomes activation whereas others inhibit it, suggesting that HSP modulators for therapeutic purposes, must be carefully chosen.
