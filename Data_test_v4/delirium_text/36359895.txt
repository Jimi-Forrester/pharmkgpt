36359895|t|Src Family Kinases Facilitate the Crosstalk between CGRP and Cytokines in Sensitizing Trigeminal Ganglion via Transmitting CGRP Receptor/PKA Pathway.
36359895|a|The communication between calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and cytokines plays a prominent role in maintaining trigeminal ganglion (TG) and trigeminovascular sensitization. However, the underlying regulatory mechanism is elusive. In this study, we explored the hypothesis that Src family kinases (SFKs) activity facilitates the crosstalk between CGRP and cytokines in sensitizing TG. Mouse TG tissue culture was performed to study CGRP release by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, cytokine release by multiplex assay, cytokine gene expression by quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and phosphorylated SFKs level by western blot. The results demonstrated that a SFKs activator, pYEEI (YGRKKRRQRRREPQY(PO3H2)EEIPIYL) alone, did not alter CGRP release or the inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) gene expression in the mouse TG. In contrast, a SFKs inhibitor, saracatinib, restored CGRP release, the inflammatory cytokines IL-1beta, C-X-C motif ligand 1, C-C motif ligand 2 (CCL2) release, and IL-1beta, CCL2 gene expression when the mouse TG was pre-sensitized with hydrogen peroxide and CGRP respectively. Consistently with this, the phosphorylated SFKs level was increased by both hydrogen peroxide and CGRP in the mouse TG, which was reduced by a CGRP receptor inhibitor BIBN4096 and a protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor PKI (14-22) Amide. The present study demonstrates that SFKs activity plays a pivotal role in facilitating the crosstalk between CGRP and cytokines by transmitting CGRP receptor/PKA signaling to potentiate TG sensitization and ultimately trigeminovascular sensitization.
