37242194|a|Some evidence shows that beverage consumption has an impact on cognitive performance. This is a follow-up study of dietary habits and cognitive function in the Chinese middle-aged and elderly population. The objective of this study was to explore the relationship between beverage consumption and cognitive impairment. The source and grouping of the participants can be seen in the previous article, "Study of Diet Habits and Cognitive Function in the Chinese Middle-Aged and Elderly Population: The Association between Folic Acid, B Vitamins, Vitamin D, Coenzyme Q10 Supplementation and Cognitive Ability". Among 892 participants, one-third (296) completed both Amyloid beta(Abeta)-PET and plasma biomarkers. The results showed that the consumption of beverages (green tea, coffee, pure milk) was a protective factor for cognitive impairment, daily water consumption <1500 mL (especially <500 mL) was a risk factor for cognitive impairment, and the above correlated with baseline cognitive status. The relationship of green tea, coffee, and pure milk consumption with cognitive impairment was related to gender. We also found that among the participants with Abeta deposition, the consumption of pure milk and green tea was associated with low levels of p-Tau-181. In conclusion, the relationship between beverage consumption and cognitive impairment in Chinese middle-aged and elderly adults may be related to baseline cognitive status, gender, and Abeta deposition.
