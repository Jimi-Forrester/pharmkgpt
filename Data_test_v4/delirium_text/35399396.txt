35399396|a|Introduction Epileptic seizure episodes can vary from brief and nearly undetectable to long periods of vigorous shaking. These episodes can result in physical injuries, occasionally including broken bones. With epilepsy, seizures tend to recur and, as a rule, have no immediate underlying cause. Status epilepticus (SE) is an attack of a seizure lasting for more than five minutes or two or more seizures without the person returning to normal between the attacks. Previous definitions used a 30-minute time limit. This study aimed to assess the clinical outcome of SE among adult patients in the Aseer region. Materials and methods A retrospective record-based cohort study design was conducted, targeting all accessible medical files of adult patients with SE who were admitted to the Aseer central hospital and military hospital from 2010 to 2017. Data were extracted from all complete and accessible files. Records with missing data were excluded. Clinical outcomes for the cases included were assessed and categorized into cases of complete recovery (without sequelae), cases with incomplete recovery, and death. Results The study included 19 adult patients with SE whose ages ranged from seven to 87 years with a mean age of 33.4 +- 22.5 years. Men made up 63.2% of the cases. Infection was the most recorded risk factor among the cases, followed by anti-epileptic drug withdrawal. Only two cases recovered with sequelae, while the remaining 17 cases recovered completely. There were no deaths. Conclusions The study revealed that nearly all cases recovered completely with no complications, particularly men who immediately received IV treatment. Early diagnosis and receiving treatment under careful observation via follow-up are recommended.
