37350284|a|INTRODUCTION: It is unclear if sex differences exist in cognitive disease progression in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia associated with atrial fibrillation (AF). METHODS: Using a variety of statistical methods, we examined sex differences between AF and neuropsychological tests and cognitive disease progression, using the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center data (N = 43,630). RESULTS: AF is associated with higher odds of dementia (odds ratio [OR] 3.00, 95% confidence interval [CI] [1.22, 7.37] in women and MCI in women (OR 3.43, 95% CI [1.55, 7.55]) versus men. Women with AF and normal baseline cognition had a higher risk of disease progression (hazard ratio [HR] 1.26, 95% CI [1.06, 1.50]) from normal to MCI and from MCI to vascular dementia (HR3.27, 95% CI [1.89, 5.65]) than men with AF or men and women without AF. DISCUSSION: AF was associated with more rapid progression to MCI and dementia in women, but more research is needed to confirm these findings.
