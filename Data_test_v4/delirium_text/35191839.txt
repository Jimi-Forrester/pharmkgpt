35191839|t|A Preoperative Virtual Reality App for Patients Scheduled for Cardiac Catheterization: Pre-Post Questionnaire Study Examining Feasibility, Usability, and Acceptability.
35191839|a|BACKGROUND: Pre- and postoperative anxiety is a common phenomenon associated with negative postoperative outcomes. Symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder, such as fear, nightmares, and sleep deprivation, are prevalent in approximately 30% to 50% of patients following discharge from intensive care units after cardiac surgery. Preliminary evidence suggests a promising role of virtual reality (VR) in preventing stress-related reactions using stress inoculation training. Such training enables cognitive preparation of individuals for stressful situations, thereby becoming more tolerant and resistant to stress, subsequently reducing the risk of potential negative psychological consequences. This study investigated a preoperative VR app-Pre-View-aimed at better informing and preparing patients for cardiac catheterization. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the feasibility, usability, and acceptability of Pre-View in patients undergoing cardiac catheterization. METHODS: Eligible participants were adults scheduled for elective cardiac catheterization. Pre-View comprised an interactive virtual representation of the whole care process related to cardiac catheterization, from entering the hospital for admission to postprocedural stay and discharge. These processes were represented through 360  videos and interactive photos. Self-report questionnaires were completed at baseline (ie, before catheterization and after undergoing the VR experience) and after cardiac catheterization. Outcome measures included user experience and satisfaction, VR presence and immersive tendencies, and user friendliness. The perceived effectiveness was assessed exploratively. RESULTS: A total of 8 individuals, with a mean age of 67 (SD 7.5) years, participated in this study. Half of them underwent the VR experience at the hospital and the other half at home. Participants reported high levels of presence in the virtual environment (Presence Questionnaire score: mean 129.1, SD 13.4). The usability of Pre-View was well evaluated (System Usability Scale score: mean 89.1, SD 12.0), and patient satisfaction was high (Client Satisfaction Questionnaire score: mean 27.1, SD 3.2). Usability and satisfaction scores were higher for participants who underwent Pre-View at home versus those who underwent Pre-View at the hospital, although the latter group was significantly older; 72.8 versus 61.3, respectively. All participants reported Pre-View to be effective in terms of feeling better informed about the care process of cardiac catheterization. Most participants (7/8, 88%) reported Pre-View to be effective in terms of feeling better prepared for cardiac catheterization, acknowledging the potential of Pre-View in reducing negative psychological consequences after catheterization. CONCLUSIONS: The results provide initial support for the feasibility and acceptability of a preoperative VR app, creating a virtual environment that supports patient education and preparation for upcoming cardiac catheterization. More studies are needed to further investigate the effects of VR as a tool to better prepare patients for medical procedures, its effectiveness in reducing negative patient outcomes (eg, anxiety, stress, and postoperative recovery outcomes), and the generalizability of effects across different settings and patient populations.
