39265701|a|Flavonoids, a commonly consumed natural product, elicit health-benefits such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, anti-allergic, hepatoprotective, anti-carcinogenic and neuroprotective activities. Several studies have reported the beneficial role of flavonoids in improving memory, learning, and cognition in clinical settings. Their mechanism of action is mediated through the modulation of multiple signalling cascades. This polypharmacology makes them an attractive natural scaffold for designing and developing new effective therapeutics for complex neurological disorders like Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Flavonoids are shown to inhibit crucial targets related to neurodegenerative disorders (NDDs), including acetylcholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase, beta-secretase, gamma-secretase, alpha-synuclein, Abeta protein aggregation and neurofibrillary tangles formation. Conserved neuro-signalling pathways related to neurotransmitter biogenesis and inactivation, ease of genetic manipulation and tractability, cost-effectiveness, and their short lifespan make Caenorhabditis elegans one of the most frequently used models in neuroscience research and high-throughput drug screening for neurodegenerative disorders. Here, we critically appraise the neuroprotective activities of different flavonoids based on clinical trials and epidemiological data. This review provides critical insights into the absorption, metabolism, and tissue distribution of various classes of flavonoids, as well as detailed mechanisms of the observed neuroprotective activities at the molecular level, to rationalize the clinical data. We further extend the review to critically evaluate the scope of flavonoids in the disease management of neurodegenerative disorders and review the suitability of C. elegans as a model organism to study the neuroprotective efficacy of flavonoids and natural products.
