33039713|t|Exploring the pathophysiology of post-sepsis syndrome to identify therapeutic opportunities.
33039713|a|Sepsis is a major health problem worldwide. As the number of sepsis cases increases, so does the number of sepsis survivors who suffer from "post-sepsis syndrome" after hospital discharge. This syndrome involves deficits in multiple systems, including the immune, cognitive, psychiatric, cardiovascular, and renal systems. Combined, these detrimental consequences lead to rehospitalizations, poorer quality of life, and increased mortality. Understanding the pathophysiology of these issues is crucial to develop new therapeutic opportunities to improve survival rate and quality of life of sepsis survivors. Such novel strategies include modulating the immune system and addressing mitochondrial dysfunction. A sepsis follow-up clinic may be useful to identify long-term health issues associated with post-sepsis syndrome and evaluate existing and novel strategies to improve the lives of sepsis survivors.
