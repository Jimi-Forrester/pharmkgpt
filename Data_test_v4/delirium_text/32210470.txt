32210470|a|Despite antiretroviral therapy human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) infection results in neuroinflammation of the central nervous system that can cause HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). The molecular mechanisms involved in the development of HAND are unclear, however, they are likely due to both direct and indirect consequences of HIV-1 infection and inflammation of the central nervous system. Additionally, opioid abuse in infected individuals has the potential to exacerbate HIV-comorbidities, such as HAND. Although restricted for productive HIV replication, astrocytes (comprising 40-70% of all brain cells) likely play a significant role in neuropathogenesis in infected individuals due to the production and response of viral proteins. The HIV-1 protein Tat is critical for viral transcription, causes neuroinflammation, and can be secreted from infected cells to affect uninfected bystander cells. The Wnt/beta-catenin signaling cascade plays an integral role in restricting HIV-1 infection in part by negatively regulating HIV-1 Tat function. Conversely, Tat can overcome this negative regulation and inhibit beta-catenin signaling by sequestering the critical transcription factor TCF-4 from binding to beta-catenin. Here, we aimed to explore how opiate exposure affects Tat-mediated suppression of beta-catenin in astrocytes and the downstream modulation of neuroinflammatory genes. We observed that morphine can potentiate Tat suppression of beta-catenin activity in human astrocytes. In contrast, Tat mutants deficient in secretion, and lacking neurotoxic effects, do not affect beta-catenin activity in the presence or absence of morphine. Finally, morphine treatment of astrocytes was sufficient to reduce the expression of genes involved in neuroinflammation. Examining the molecular mechanisms of how HIV-1 infection and opiate exposure exacerbate neuroinflammation may help us inform or predict disease progression prior to HAND development.
