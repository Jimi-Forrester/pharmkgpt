35742061|t|Singing for the Rehabilitation of Acquired Neurogenic Communication Disorders: Continuing the Evidence Dialogue with a Survey of Current Practices in Speech-Language Pathology.
35742061|a|Therapeutic applications of singing (e.g., melodic intonation therapy) for acquired neurogenic communication disorders (ANCD) such as post-stroke aphasia, dysarthria, or neurodegenerative diseases have emerged from innovations by clinical speech-language pathologists (SLPs). However, these specialists have never been systematically consulted about the use of singing in their practices. We report a survey of 395 SLPs in France using an online questionnaire (September 2018-January 2019). Most (98%) knew that singing could be a therapeutic tool. A wide variety of uses emerged in our data. Some practices (e.g., song games) have not yet been investigated in research settings. Melodic therapy, which is supported by scientific evidence, is familiar to clinicians (90%), but they lack training and rarely follow a full protocol. Over half of respondents (62%) recognize group singing for various benefits, but do not often use it, mainly due to the lack of adapted or welcoming choirs in their area. These results provide key information for continued dialogue between researchers, clinicians, and the community. Considering the aging population and the associated increase in the prevalence of ANCD, access to group singing in particular could be facilitated for these patients from a social prescription perspective with further research evidence.
