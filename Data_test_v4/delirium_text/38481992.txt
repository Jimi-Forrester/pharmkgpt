38481992|t|Machine learning and experimental validation identified autophagy signature in hepatic fibrosis.
38481992|a|Background: The molecular mechanisms of hepatic fibrosis (HF), closely related to autophagy, remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate autophagy characteristics in HF. Methods: Gene expression profiles (GSE6764, GSE49541 and GSE84044) were downloaded, normalized, and merged. Autophagy-related differentially expressed genes (ARDEGs) were determined using the limma R package and the Wilcoxon rank sum test and then analyzed by GO, KEGG, GSEA and GSVA. The infiltration of immune cells, molecular subtypes and immune types of healthy control (HC) and HF were analyzed. Machine learning was carried out with two methods, by which, core genes were obtained. Models of liver fibrosis in vivo and in vitro were constructed to verify the expression of core genes and corresponding immune cells. Results: A total of 69 ARDEGs were identified. Series functional cluster analysis showed that ARDEGs were significantly enriched in autophagy and immunity. Activated CD4 T cells, CD56bright natural killer cells, CD56dim natural killer cells, eosinophils, macrophages, mast cells, neutrophils, and type 17 T helper (Th17) cells showed significant differences in infiltration between HC and HF groups. Among ARDEGs, three core genes were identified, that were ATG5, RB1CC1, and PARK2. Considerable changes in the infiltration of immune cells were observed at different expression levels of the three core genes, among which the expression of RB1CC1 was significantly associated with the infiltration of macrophage, Th17 cell, natural killer cell and CD56dim natural killer cell. In the mouse liver fibrosis experiment, ATG5, RB1CC1, and PARK2 were at higher levels in HF group than those in HC group. Compared with HC group, HF group showed low positive area in F4/80, IL-17 and CD56, indicating decreased expression of macrophage, Th17 cell, natural killer cell and CD56dim natural killer cell. Meanwhile, knocking down RB1CC1 was found to inhibit the activation of hepatic stellate cells and alleviate liver fibrosis. Conclusion: ATG5, RB1CC1, and PARK2 are promising autophagy-related therapeutic biomarkers for HF. This is the first study to identify RB1CC1 in HF, which may promote the progression of liver fibrosis by regulating macrophage, Th17 cell, natural killer cell and CD56dim natural killer cell.
