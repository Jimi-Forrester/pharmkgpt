30209926|a|Diagnosis of CNS infections remains a great challenge in immunocompromised patients with solid cancer or hematological disorders, as it happens with transplant recipients, since symptoms might both be masked and be mimicked by other conditions such as metabolic disturbances or consequences of antineoplastic treatment and the administration of immunosuppressive drugs. Thus, awareness of this complication is crucial and any suspicion of a CNS infection should lead to make an early diagnosis and to choose an appropriate empirical treatment to improve the outcome in this population.
