7572076|t|Paired helical filaments and straight tubules in astrocytes: an electron microscopic study in dementia of the Alzheimer type.
7572076|a|Ultrastructural investigation of the hippocampal CA1 and CA4 of nine autopsy-proven cases of dementia of the Alzheimer type (duration of disease: 3-16 years; age: 76-92 years) revealed paired helical filaments (PHFs) and straight tubules (STs) in astrocytes of three advanced cases of long duration (> 13 years). The PHFs and STs were indistinguishable from those seen in neurons. The abnormal glial fibrils were confined to the astrocytic processes that were associated with small vessels or, more frequently, with ghost tangles. In both locations the astrocytic PHFs and STs were located in the cytoplasm without limiting membranes, and were thicker than the straight filaments that composed ghost tangles. These findings, combined with the presence of regular constrictions of astrocytic PHFs, suggest that abnormal astrocytic fibers are produced by the glial cells, not engulfed by them. In addition, the presence of these abnormal glial filaments in only advanced, long-duration cases of dementia of the Alzheimer type suggests that disease duration has a significant effect upon the formation of these astrocytic profiles.
