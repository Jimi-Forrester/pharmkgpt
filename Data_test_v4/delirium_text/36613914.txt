36613914|t|Neuronal and Glial Communication via Non-Coding RNAs: Messages in Extracellular Vesicles.
36613914|a|Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have been increasingly recognized as essential players in cell communication in many organs and systems, including the central nervous system (CNS). A proper interaction between neural cells is fundamental in the regulation of neurophysiological processes and its alteration could induce several pathological phenomena, such as neurodegeneration, neuroinflammation, and demyelination. EVs contain and transfer complex molecular cargoes typical of their cells of origin, such as proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and metabolites to recipient cells. EVs are also enriched in non-coding RNAs (e.g., microRNAs, lncRNAs, and circRNA), which were formerly considered as cell-intrinsic regulators of CNS functions and pathologies, thus representing a new layer of regulation in the cell-to-cell communication. In this review, we summarize the most recent and advanced studies on the role of EV-derived ncRNAs in the CNS. First, we report the potential of neural stem cell-derived ncRNAs as new therapeutic tools for neurorepair. Then, we discuss the role of neuronal ncRNAs in regulating glia activation, and how alteration in glial ncRNAs influences neuronal survival and synaptic functions. We conclude that EV-derived ncRNAs can act as intercellular signals in the CNS to either propagate neuroinflammatory waves or promote reparative functions.
