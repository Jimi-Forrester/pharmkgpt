39574432|a|Background: The interplay between breast cancer treatment and osteoporosis has important consequences for anticancer therapy and patient bone health. Many breast cancer therapies involve hormonal treatments that lower estrogen levels, which can lead to an increased risk of osteoporosis due to reduced bone mineral density. Aromatase inhibitors, chemotherapy, and surgeries such as oophorectomy can further aggravate bone loss, highlighting the necessity of prioritizing bone health during cancer treatment. Objective: This review is aimed at investigating the complex relationship between breast cancer therapies and bone health by examining the molecular and cellular mechanisms through which anticancer treatments lead to bone loss. It also seeks to assess the effects of various treatment options, such as selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) and bisphosphonates, on reducing bone loss and maintaining bone health during cancer therapy. Method: The review explores the mechanisms underlying bone loss in breast cancer patients undergoing treatment, focusing on factors such as estrogen depletion, inflammatory cytokines, and changes in bone remodelling processes. Additionally, it evaluates the efficacy of different therapeutic interventions, including pharmacological treatments like bisphosphonates and third-generation SERMs, in mitigating bone-related side effects. Results: The findings indicate a critical need to balance the effectiveness of breast cancer treatments with the preservation of bone health. Pharmacological treatments like bisphosphonates and denosumab have been identified as essential for managing bone health in breast cancer patients. Furthermore, third-generation SERMs show potential in reducing bone loss associated with cancer therapy.
