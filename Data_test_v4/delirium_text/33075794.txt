33075794|t|Characteristics and Real-Life Outcomes of Dementia and Cognitive Impairment at a Geriatric Clinic.
33075794|a|BACKGROUND: Various patterns of dementia care have been developed in different settings, depending on the availability of healthcare resources and facilities. The purpose of this study was to examine the epidemiology and characteristics of dementia care at a geriatric clinic, a field that has been subject to little prior evaluation. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was undertaken of cohort patients with cognitive impairment who had received a diagnosis and were still on active follow-up at a geriatric clinic. A total of 892 patients were included. In addition, 203 geriatric patients with no cognitive impairment who attended the clinic during the study period were sampled as a control. RESULTS: The main diagnoses of dementia were Alzheimer's disease (AD) (40.1%), vascular dementia (16.9%), unspecified dementia (16.3%), mixed dementia (9.0%), AD with cerebrovascular disease (8.7%), and Parkinson's disease dementia (6.1%). Atypical dementia was presented in 3.0% of cases. There were 178 patients with mild cognitive impairment, 20 with vascular cognitive impairment, and 18 with subjective cognitive decline. Other comorbidities were found in 97% of the subjects. Patients with cognitive impairment had a higher total number of other geriatric syndromes and higher percentages for delirium, falls, immobility, loss of appetite, and incontinence. Potentially reversible causes of dementia were found in 11.3% of the cases. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors were administered to 61%, whereas 23.5% received an NMDA receptor antagonist. The need for a change in the antidementia medication was identified for 10.7% of the subjects; the major cause was adverse drug side effects. Nonpharmacological therapy only was administered to 52.4% of the people with dementia who had behavioral and psychological symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Mixed brain pathologies, comorbidities, and the coexistence of other geriatric syndromes are common at geriatric clinics. Holistic, integrated, and continuous care are needed to improve the outcomes of patients with more complicated comorbidities.
