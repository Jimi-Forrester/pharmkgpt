37516594|t|The Prognostic Value of Johns Hopkins Hospital Nutrition Support Score in Older Patients Undergoing Cardiovascular Surgery.
37516594|a|OBJECTIVES: Clarify the prognostic value of the Johns Hopkins Hospital Nutrition Support (JHHNS) score on clinical outcomes in older patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). DESIGN: A retrospective observational study. SETTING: A teaching and university hospital and tertiary referral center. PARTICIPANTS: The authors analyzed 328 older patients aged >=65 who underwent cardiovascular surgery with CPB in 2020. INTERVENTIONS: Malnutrition risk was identified by the JHHNS score calculated based on specific preoperative and intraoperative objective parameters. Patients were divided into low- and high-JHHNS groups. Early morbidity, including pneumonia, bacteremia, wound infection, cerebrovascular accident, gastrointestinal bleeding, acute kidney injury, delirium, requirement for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and readmission to the intensive care unit (ICU), were the primary outcome; whereas in-hospital mortality, length of ICU and hospital stay, duration of mechanical ventilation and short-term mortality were secondary outcomes. The independent risk factors for postoperative complications were analyzed by logistic regression analyses. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The JHHNS score identified 21.0% of patients at risk for malnutrition. Patients in the high-JHHNS group had prolonged median length hospital stay (21 v 24 days, p = 0.002) and mechanical ventilation (13.0 v 16.0 hours, p = 0.038), and more patients in this subgroup stayed longer than 3 days in ICU (30.1% v 43.5%, p = 0.036). Besides, they experienced more postoperative complications (11.2% v 39.1%, p < 0.001). Furthermore, multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that the JHHNS score independently predicted the risk of postoperative complications. No significant intergroup difference was observed for the short-term mortality. CONCLUSIONS: The JHHNS score was an independent predictor for postoperative complications but did not significantly affect short-term mortality in older patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery with CPB.
