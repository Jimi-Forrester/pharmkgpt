11407129|t|Olanzapine: another psychotropic?
11407129|a|Olanzapine is a favorable drug with a potential treatment of delirium, psychotic depression, mood disorders and nausea with a single drug in advanced cancer patients. Additional benefits include weight gain. The medication has few drug interactions, a narrow therapeutic window and high drug cost, which is a disadvantage compounded by a single route of administration. Reduced hospitalizations, at least in the psychiatric patient, may offset the drug cost.
