36401799|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex disease that shares clinical features with other dementias. It is important to establish a specific and reliable diagnosis. Nowadays, AD diagnosis is based on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers. However, the corresponding cut-offs differ amongst studies. This study aims to evaluate the CSF biomarkers in the AD differential diagnosis. METHODS: Clinical relevant biomarkers (amyloid beta42 (Abeta42), t-Tau, p-Tau, amyloid beta40 (Abeta40), neurofilament light chain (NfL)) were determined in CSF samples from participants classified as AD (n = 124) and non-AD (n = 148) patients from the Neurology Unit. They were included and evaluated consecutively (August 2018-October 2020). The clinical utility of these biomarkers was evaluated by AUC-ROC curves and the corresponding cut-off points were defined. RESULTS: The results showed satisfactory accuracy (AUC-ROC 0.91 for Abeta42, 0.890 for t-Tau and 0.933 for p-Tau); whilst Abeta40 and NfL did not show good discriminatory capacity (AUC-ROC 0.557 and 0.738, respectively). The ratios Abeta42/Abeta40 and t-Tau/Abeta42 improved the diagnosis indices of each individual biomarker, with AUC-ROC of 0.980 and 0.971, respectively. Also, elevated levels of NfL were found in the frontotemporal dementia group compared with the other participant groups. CONCLUSIONS: The ratio Abeta42/Abeta40 showed the highest discriminating capacity between AD and non-AD patients and might be useful in clinical practice. Regarding NfL, it is not a specific biomarker for AD; however, it might be helpful for the differential diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia. Nevertheless, further analysis in an external cohort is required in order to validate these results.
