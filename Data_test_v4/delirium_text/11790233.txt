11790233|a|CONTEXT: Patients affected by sporadic Alzheimer disease (AD) show a significant alteration of amyloid precursor protein (APP) forms in platelets when compared with patients with dementia but without AD and age-matched controls. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the ratio of platelet APP forms (APPr) in early-stage AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and its potential as a biomarker for the early identification of AD. SETTING: Community population-based sample of patients admitted to 4 AD centers for investigation of cognitive disturbances. DESIGN AND METHODS: Thirty-five patients with mild AD (mAD), 21 patients with very mild AD (vmAD), 30 subjects with MCI, and 25 age-matched controls were included. The APPr was evaluated by Western blot analysis in platelet homogenate. RESULTS: Compared with controls (mean +/- SD, 0.93 +/- 0.3), the mean APPr was decreased in patients with mAD (0.44 +/- 0.24; P<.001) and patients with vmAD (0.49 +/- 0.3; P<.001). Regarding the MCI group, a significant decrease in APPr was found compared with controls (0.62 +/- 0.33; P<.001). Fixing a cutoff score of 0.6, sensitivity was 88.6% (31/35) for patients with mAD and 85.7% (18/21) for patients with vmAD, whereas specificity was 88% (22/25) for controls. Among patients with MCI, 18 (60%) of 30 individuals displayed APPr values below the cutoff. CONCLUSIONS: Alteration of platelet APP forms is an early event in AD, and the measurement of APPr may be useful for the identification of preclinical AD in patients with MCI.
