34906179|a|BACKGROUND: Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is one of the most common. Neuroprotective effects of dexmedetomidine (DEX) are reported in previous studies but evidence regarding the POCD is still unclear. In order to gain latest evidence, the present study analyzes the outcomes of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which utilized DEX with general anaesthesia perioperatively. METHOD: Four online databases (PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and CNKI) were used to find relevant RCTs to conduct systematic analysis. All studies comparing the incidence of POCD or MMSE score between the DEX group and the placebo or comparator group in patients undergoing general anaesthetic surgery were eligible for inclusion. Based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the studies were selected. This meta-analysis was performed using odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous data and standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% CIs for continuous data as effective measures. RESULTS: In total of 21 studies were included in this meta-analysis. The results showed that the incidence of POCD in DEX group was significantly lower than the control group on the first (OR = 0.36, 95% CI 0.24-0.54),third (OR = 0.45,95% CI 0.33-0.61) and seventh (OR = 0.40,95% CI 0.26-0.60) postoperative days; the MMSE scores in DEX group were higher than the control group on the first (SMD = 1.24, 95% CI 1.08-1.41), third(SMD = 1.09, 95%CI 0.94-1.24) and seventh (SMD = 3.28, 95% CI 1.51-5.04) postoperative days. CONCLUSIONS: Intraoperative DEX use can ameliorate the POCD of patients who received surgical operations under general anesthesia, and effectively reduce the incidence of POCD and improve MMSE score.
