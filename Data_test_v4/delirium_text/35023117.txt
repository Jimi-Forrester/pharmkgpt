35023117|a|A large number of plasma proteomic biomarkers have been discovered in the field of neurodegenerative diseases. Novel biomarker molecules in plasma and serum could significantly reduce the need for invasive methods in clinical practice such as the lumbar puncture for CSF collection and may be useful to specific patients. Furthermore, candidate biomarker proteins that have been identified and validated could be used to discriminate Alphalzheimer's disease patients from MCI and healthy controls in clinical trials, before the onset of clinical symptoms as well as to improve personalized therapies. The development of new blood-based biomarkers via proteomic technology offers a deep knowledge in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases and involves in the development of new therapeutic targets. This report presents numerous dietary compounds that either promote or suppress the expression of biomarkers mainly in the blood of AD or MCI subjects.
