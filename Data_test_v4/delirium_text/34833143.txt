34833143|t|Peripheral Neuropathy Presents Similar Symptoms and Pathological Changes in Both High-Fat Diet and Pharmacologically Induced Pre- and Diabetic Mouse Models.
34833143|a|The objective of the study was to compare the effects of experimentally induced type 1 or type 2 diabetes (T1D or T2D) on the functional, structural and biochemical properties of mouse peripheral nerves. Eight-week-old C57BL/6 mice were randomly assigned into three groups, including the control (CTRL, chow-fed), STZ (streptozotocin (STZ)-injected), and HFD (high-fat diet (HFD)-fed) group. After 18-weeks of experimental treatment, HFD mice had higher body weights and elevated levels of plasma lipids, while STZ mice developed hyperglycemia. STZ-treated mice, after an extended period of untreated diabetes, developed motor and sensory nerve conduction-velocity deficits. Moreover, relative to control fibers, pre- and diabetic axons were lower in number and irregular in shape. Animals from both treatment groups manifested a pronounced overexpression of nNOS and a reduced expression of SOD1 proteins in the sciatic nerve, indicating oxidative-nitrosative stress and ineffective antioxidant protection in the peripheral nervous system of these mice. Collectively, STZ- and HFD-treated mice revealed similar characteristics of peripheral nerve damage, including a number of morphological and electrophysiological pathologies in the sciatic nerve. While hyperglycemia is a large component of diabetic neuropathy pathogenesis, the non-hyperglycemic effects of diabetes, including dyslipidemia, may also be of importance in the development of this condition.
