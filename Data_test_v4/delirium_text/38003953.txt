38003953|t|Effectiveness of Intravenous Non-Opioid Analgesics for Postoperative Pain Management of in Patients Undergoing Hip Surgery: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
38003953|a|Background and Objectives: Intravenous (IV) non-opioid analgesics (NOAs) have been extensively investigated as a multimodal analgesic strategy for the management of acute pain after hip surgery. This pair-wise meta-analysis examined IV NOA effects following hip surgery. Materials and Methods: A systematic search of the MEDLINE (PUBMED), Embase, and Cochrane Library databases was performed for studies investigating the effect of IV NOA for postoperative pain management following hip surgery up to 7 June 2023. We compared in-admission opioid use, postoperative VAS (visual analogue scale) score, hospital stay duration, and opioid-related adverse events between IV NOA and control groups. Results: Seven studies were included with a total of 953 patients who underwent hip surgery. Of these, 478 underwent IV NOA treatment, and 475 did not. The IV NOA groups had lower opioid use within 24-h following hip surgery (SMD, -0.48; 95% CI, -0.66 to -0.30; p < 0.01), lower VAS score (SMD, -0.47; 95% CI, -0.79 to -0.16; p < 0.01), shorter hospital stay (SMD, -0.28; 95% CI, -0.44 to -0.12; p < 0.01), and lower incidence of nausea and vomiting (OR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.15 to 0.67; p < 0.01) compared with the control groups. Conclusions: This meta-analysis demonstrated that IV NOA administration following hip surgery may have more favorable postoperative outcomes than those in control groups.
