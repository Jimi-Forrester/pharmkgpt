20641301|a|Phosphodiesterases (PDEs) are composed of at least 11 families of enzymes that hydrolyze cyclic 3 ,5 -adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and/or 3 ,5 -guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) to the corresponding inactive 5 -AMP and 5 -GMP, respectively (1, 2). These second-messenger cyclic nucleotides are formed in response to stimuli (such as hormones, neurotransmitters, and cytokines) to regulate cellular functions. PDEs are essential in the termination of cellular responses via their degradation of cyclic nucleotides. PDE type-4 (PDE4) is Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin independent, cAMP specific, and found mainly in the kidney, brain, liver, lung, Sertoli cells, and lymphoid cells (2, 3). There are four subtypes of PDE4 enzymes. PDE4 activity and density are up-regulated by increasing cAMP levels through phosphorylation with protein kinase A (4). PDE4 inhibitors have been studied in the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders (depression and dementia of Alzheimer s disease) (5-7) and inflammatory diseases (asthma) (8, 9). <i>R</i>/S-4-(3-Cyclopentoxy-4-methoxy-phenyl)pyrrolidin-2-one (<i>R</i>/S-rolipram) was found to be a specific inhibitor of all four subtypes of PDE4 with high affinity (<i>K</i><sub>d</sub> = 1-2 nM) (10). DaSilva et al. (11) reported IC<sub>50</sub> values for <i>R</i>-, <i>R/S</i>-, and <i>S</i>-rolipram of 2-5, 5-7, and 42-95 nM, respectively. PDE4 is highly expressed in rat brain (<i>B</i><sub>max</sub> >100 fmol/mg of tissue) (10, 12). The clinical program for rolipram was ultimately suspended in humans using pharmacologic doses because of its side effects, such as emesis and sedation (13). However, the action of the compound on PDE4 would be useful as a tool to better understand the biochemical basis of depression and the role that PDE4 inhibitors may play in antidepressant therapy (14). At least one study using positron emission tomography (PET) to study <i>R</i>-[<sup>11</sup>C]rolipram in humans was reported in 2002. <i>R</i>-[<sup>11</sup>C]Rolipram is being developed as a PET agent for the non-invasive study of PDE4 in the brain in small animals.
