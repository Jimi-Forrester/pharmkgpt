15779239|t|Immunological and anti-chaperone therapeutic approaches for Alzheimer disease.
15779239|a|Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia. Currently available therapies only provide symptomatic relief. A number of therapeutic approaches are under development that aim to increase the clearance of brain Abeta peptides. These include immune mediated clearance of Abeta and the inhibition of the interaction between Abeta and its pathological chaperones. Both active and passive immunization has been shown to have robust effects in transgenic mouse models of AD on amyloid reduction and behavioral improvements. However, a human trial of active immunization has been associated with significant toxicity in a minority of patients. New generation vaccines are being developed which likely will reduce the potential for cell-mediated toxicity. In addition, the recent development of anti-chaperone therapy opens a new therapeutic avenue which is unlikely to be associated with toxicity.
