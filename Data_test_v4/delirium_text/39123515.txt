39123515|t|Assessment of Multifunctional Activity of a Postbiotic Preparation Derived from Lacticaseibacillus paracasei Postbiotic-P6.
39123515|a|Postbiotics possess various functional activities, closely linked to their source bacterial strains and preparation methods. Therefore, the functional activities of postbiotics need to be evaluated through in vitro and in vivo methods. This study aims to prepare a postbiotic and explore its antihemolytic, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antibacterial activities. Specifically, a postbiotic preparation named PostbioP-6 was prepared by intercepting 1-5 kDa of Lacticaseibacillus paracasei Postbiotic-P6 fermentation broth. The results demonstrate that PostbioP-6 exhibited notable biological activities across multiple assays. It showed significant antihemolytic activity, with a 4.9-48.1% inhibition rate at 10-50% concentrations. Anti-inflammatory effects were observed both in vitro, where 8-40% PostbioP-6 was comparable to 259.1-645.4 mug/mL diclofenac sodium, and in vivo, where 3.5 and 4.0 muL/mL PostbioP-6 significantly reduced neutrophil counts in inflamed zebrafish (p < 0.05). Antioxidant properties were evident through increased reducing power (OD700 increased from 0.279 to 2.322 at 1.25-12.5% concentrations), DPPH radical scavenging activity (38.9-92.4% scavenging rate at 2.5-50% concentrations), and hydroxyl radical scavenging activity (4.66-10.38% scavenging rate at 0.5-4% concentrations). Additionally, PostbioP-6 demonstrated antimicrobial activity against two Gram-positive bacteria, eight Gram-negative bacteria, and one fungus. Furthermore, PostbioP-6 significantly inhibited the increase in peroxide value and malondialdehyde content in cookies, highlighting its potential application in food preservation. In conclusion, we prepared a novel postbiotic, termed PostbioP-6, which proved to have prominent anti-hemolytic, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and broad-spectrum antimicrobial activities. The multifunctional properties of PostbioP-6 position it as a potentially effective functional food supplement or preservative. In the future, further research is necessary to elucidate the precise mechanisms of action, identify the active components, and validate its biological activities in animal models or clinical trials.
