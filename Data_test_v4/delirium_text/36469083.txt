36469083|t|Surgical treatment of proximal femoral fractures in centenarians: prevalence and outcomes based on a German multicenter study.
36469083|a|PURPOSE: This study aimed to estimate the survival rate after proximal femoral fracture insult and identify the subgroup of centenarians with a high risk. METHODS: Records of patients (>= 65 years) who underwent surgery for PFF between 2006 and 2020 were retrieved from the electronic databases of three hospitals. Overall, 22 demographic, perioperative, and postoperative variables were analyzed for all patients > 99 years of age. The effect of anemia, time to surgery, surgical procedure, place of residence, and dementia on complications and survival were evaluated. RESULTS: The study included 85 patients (women n = 71; men n = 14; median age, 100 years; range 100-106 years). Over the study period, the prevalence of centenarians with PFF increased (0.94%). The overall complication rate was 28% (in-hospital death, n = 16; infection, n = 1; hematoma, n = 1; implant failure, n = 1; cardiac decompensation, n = 3; pneumonia with delirium, n = 1; urinary tract infection, n = 1). The 30-day, 3-month, 6-month, and 1-year mortality rates for the study group were 27.1%, 42.4%, 55.3%, and 61.2%, respectively. Median survival was 150 days (range 1-1942 days). Patients with dementia (n = 47) had a shorter survival time than patients without dementia (n = 38) (hazard ratio 1.75; 95% confidence interval 1.04, 2.95). Preoperative anemia, time to surgery, or necessary surgical procedure had no impact on survival. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of centenarians undergoing surgery for PFF is increasing. In-hospital mortality is high, and dementia is a risk factor impacting survival. The rates of surgical revision and general complications are low, and the chosen predictors had no significant impact on these outcomes. The survival rate after discharge from hospital seems to be comparable to the estimated survival rate of uninjured centenarians.
