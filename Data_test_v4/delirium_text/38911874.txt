38911874|t|Hearing loss and cognitive decline: Prioritizing equity in a world in which hearing health matters.
38911874|a|Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRDs) and age-related hearing loss are the intersection of two major public health challenges. With age as the primary risk factor for both disease processes, the burden of ADRDs and age-related hearing loss is growing, and each field maintains significant barriers to broadscale identification and management that is affordable and accessible. With the disproportionate burden of ADRDs among racial and ethnic minority older adults and existing disparities within hearing care, both areas face challenges in achieving equitable access and outcomes across diverse populations. The publication of the Aging and Cognitive Health Evaluation in Elders (ACHIEVE) trial in July 2023 marked a significant moment in the fields of brain and hearing health. The ACHIEVE trial was the first randomized controlled trial to examine whether providing hearing intervention, specifically provision of hearing aids, compared to an education control, would reduce cognitive changes over 3 years. The participants most at risk for cognitive decline, with lower education, lower income, more likely to identify as Black, and have more cardiovascular risk factors, were the participants who benefited most from the hearing intervention and are also the least likely to be represented in research and the least likely to obtain hearing care. With growing evidence of the interconnection between cognitive and sensory health, we have an opportunity to prioritize equity, from purposeful inclusion of diverse participants in trials to influencing the emerging market of over-the-counter hearing aids to supporting expanded models of hearing care that reach those who have traditionally gone unserved. No longer can hearing go unrecognized by clinicians, researchers, and advocates for brain health. At the same time, the fields of brain and hearing health must center equity if we are going to meet the needs of diverse older adults in a world in which hearing health matters.
