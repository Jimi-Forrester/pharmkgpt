31186907|t|Cognitive impairment and assistive devices: Outcomes and adverse effects.
31186907|a|PURPOSE: The goal of this review was to investigate the relationship between cognitive impairment and assistive device use in elderly persons. METHODS: English-language articles for people aged 65 and over were identified by searching MEDLINE and Embase (1985-June 2015) with the keywords "self-help devices" and "cognition disorders" and relevant synonyms. Bibliographies of retrieved articles were also examined; 510 articles were selected for further evaluation. Abstracts of the remaining articles were evaluated and all of the studies that concerned one or more of the following criteria were included: geriatric, long-term care residents or cognitively impaired patients using assistive devices that addressed benefits, risks, adverse effects, or other problems. Ultimately, 15 articles were analyzed and included in the review. RESULTS: Very few good-quality studies that specifically addressed the research question were found. We found that cognitively impaired elderly patients were more likely to use assistive devices ineffectively than cognitively intact elders. In addition, the literature describes promising approaches to assistive device training and technologies to accommodate cognitive impairment in this population. CONCLUSION: The evidence basis for recommendations and training for assistive devices for cognitively impaired elders is weak. More research is needed on safety and effectiveness of devices for this population.
