31542051|a|BACKGROUND: Oxidative stress is the hallmark of diabetic encephalopathy, which may be caused by hyperglycaemic toxicity. We aimed to discover pharmacologic targets to restore redox homeostasis. We identified the transcription factor Nrf2 as such a target. METHODS: HT22 cells were cultured in 25 or 50 mM D-glucose with various concentrations of sulforaphane (SFN) (from 1.25 to 5.0 muM). Cell viability was tested with the Cell Counting Kit-8 assay. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was detected with an inverted fluorescence microscope using the dichlorodihydrofluorescein-diacetate fluorescent probe. The expression of NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), haem oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) at the mRNA and protein levels was detected by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. RESULT: We found that a high glucose concentration (50 mM) increased the generation of ROS, downregulated the expression of Nrf2/HO-1 and upregulated the expression of NF-kappaB. Moreover, HT22 cell viability significantly decreased after culture in high-glucose medium for 24, 48 and 72 h, whereas the activation of the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway using a pharmacological Nrf2 activator abrogated this high-glucose-induced toxicity. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that the activation of the Nrf2-ARE signalling pathway might be a therapeutic target for the treatment of diabetic encephalopathy.
