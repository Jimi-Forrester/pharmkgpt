30288133|a|The population is aging worldwide, and hospitals are admitting a higher proportion of acutely unwell older people. Population-specific factors such as multimorbidity and frailty in older people compounded by deficient expertise contribute to longer lengths of stay, higher readmission rates, and increased rates of institutionalization. A wide range of acute geriatric care models are currently providing acute care to frail older people and these have been shown to provide a cost-effective high-quality service. In this review, population-specific factors, service models, and a wide range of patient-related outcomes of "at risk" older people admitted to an acute geriatric care unit are explored. In addition, we also discuss data measurements and a quality improvement methodology to improve the delivery of care based on the patient outcome data. We hope, in addition to ensuring effectiveness and sustainability of our current services, this may also enhance academic research. Regular monitoring and evaluation of patient-related clinical outcomes not only improve the patient care and reduce the caregiver burden but also help in implementing quality initiatives to develop existing services.
