29157110|t|Risk factors and clinical outcomes of delirium in osteoporotic hip fractures.
29157110|a|PURPOSE: This study is performed to identify risk factors for delirium in osteoporotic hip fractures and to evaluate the hospitalization cost and clinical outcomes of delirium in osteoporotic hip. METHODS: A total of 221 patients with osteoporotic hip fractures were assessed for eligibility between 2010 and 2014. Among them, 37 patients with delirium were allocated into the delirium group (group D) and 37 patients without delirium were allocated into the non-delirium group (group ND) by matching demographic factors. Risk factors such as time between admission and operation, body mass index, American Society of Anesthesiologists status, cognitive impairment, preoperative urinary catheter, electrolyte imbalance, preoperative hemoglobin, polymedication (medications > 5), pneumonia, anesthesia time, operation time, estimated blood loss, and total amount of transfusion were evaluated for correlation with incidence of delirium. The hospitalization cost was evaluated, and clinical outcomes such as readmission, mortality, and activity level at 1-year follow-up were evaluated. RESULTS: In multivariate analysis, polymedication ( p = 0.028) and preoperative indwelling urinary catheter insertion status ( p = 0.007) were related to the incidence of delirium in patients with osteoporotic hip fractures. Group D showed a significantly higher hospitalization cost compared to group ND. However, delirium did not have a significant effect on length of hospital stay, readmission rate, postoperative 1-year mortality, and activity level. CONCLUSIONS: Polymedication and preoperative urinary catheter were related to perioperative delirium. In addition, delirium in osteoporotic hip fractures may not have a detrimental effect on clinical outcomes; however, hospitalization cost seemed to be increased due to delirium.
