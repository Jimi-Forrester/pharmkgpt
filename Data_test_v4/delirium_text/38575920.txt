38575920|t|Association between symptoms of depression and inflammatory parameters in people aged over 90 years.
38575920|a|BACKGROUND: Old age is a period of life that presents many health and social challenges, resulting in a greater vulnerability to the development of mental disorders, including depression. There has been a growing interest in the relationship between depression and inflammatory factors, because of its potential clinical and therapeutic implications. Inflammatory processes, which were originally understood as a response to infection and trauma, appear to play an important role in the pathogenesis of depression in the elderly. The aim of the study was to analyse the relationship between the severity of depressive disorders and inflammatory parameters in people over 90 years of age. METHODS: The study was conducted in Poland in 2017. The study population consisted of long-lived individuals, both living at home and staying in residential care homes. The participants were 90 people of both sexes (69 women and 21 men), aged between 90 and 103 years (mean = 92.36; SD = 2.98). The study was conducted using the diagnostic survey method with a questionnaire technique. The Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) was used to carry out the analysis. The levels of selected inflammatory factors were determined using relevant laboratory tests. RESULTS: In the study group, the highest percentage of people had symptoms of moderate depression (n = 36;40%), followed by those without depression (n = 35;38.9%). There was a weak negative correlation between GDS scores and fibrinogen levels (p <= 0.05). The logistic regression model showed no significant relationship between inflammatory parameters and the development of depressive disorders. CONCLUSIONS: Inflammatory parameters do not appear to predict the development of depressive disorders in people over 90 years of age.
