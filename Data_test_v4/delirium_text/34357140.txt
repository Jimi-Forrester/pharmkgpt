34357140|t|Low Psoas Lumbar Vertebral Index Is Associated with Mortality after Hip Fracture Surgery in Elderly Patients: A Retrospective Analysis.
34357140|a|The psoas-to-lumbar index (PLVI) has been reported as a simple and easy way to measure central sarcopenia. However, only few studies have evaluated the association between PLVI and survival in surgical patients. This study evaluated the association between preoperative PLVI and mortality in elderly patients who underwent hip fracture surgery. We retrospectively analyzed 615 patients who underwent hip fracture surgery between January 2014 and December 2018. The median value of each PLVI was calculated according to sex, and the patients were categorized into two groups on the basis of the median value (low PLVI group vs. high PLVI group). Cox regression analysis was performed to evaluate the risk factors for 1 year and overall mortalities. The median values of PLVI were 0.62 and 0.50 in men and women, respectively. In the Cox regression analysis, low PLVI was significantly associated with higher 1 year (hazard ratio (HR): 1.87, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.18-2.96, p = 0.008) and overall mortalities (HR: 1.51, 95% CI: 1.12-2.03, p = 0.006). Low PLVI was significantly associated with a higher mortality. Therefore, PLVI might be an independent predictor of mortality in elderly patients undergoing hip fracture surgery.
