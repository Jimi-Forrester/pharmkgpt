38449856|t|The correlation between admission hyperglycemia and 30-day readmission after hip fracture surgery in geriatric patients: a propensity score-matched study.
38449856|a|Purpose: This study aimed to investigate the association between admission hyperglycemia and 30-day readmission after hip fracture surgery in geriatric patients. Methods: This retrospective study included 1253 geriatric hip fracture patients. Patients were categorized into normoglycemia(<6.10 mmol/L) and hyperglycemia groups(>=6.10 mmol/L) based on admission blood glucose. We performed multivariable logistic regression analyses and propensity score matching (PSM) to estimate adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for 30-day readmission, controlling for potential confounding factors. An analysis of the dose-dependent association between admission blood glucose and the probability of 30-day readmission was performed. Additional subgroup analysis was conducted to examine the impact of other factors on the relationship between admission blood glucose and 30-day readmission. Results: Patients with hyperglycemia had higher 30-day readmission rates than normoglycemic patients before (19.1% vs 9.7%, p<0.001) and after PSM (18.1% vs 12.3%, p=0.035). Admission hyperglycemia was an independent predictor of increased 30-day readmission risk, with an adjusted odds ratio of 1.57 (95% CI 1.08-2.29, p=0.019) after multivariable regression and 1.57 (95% CI 1.03-2.39, p=0.036) after PSM. A dose-response relationship was observed between higher glucose levels and increased readmission risk. Conclusion: Admission hyperglycemia is an independent risk factor for 30-day readmission after hip fracture surgery in the elderly. Routine glucose testing upon admission and perioperative glycemic control may help reduce short-term readmissions in this vulnerable population.
