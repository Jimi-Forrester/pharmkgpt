However, the availability of safe and effective treatments for AD remains limited. Adoptive Treg therapy has been explored for treating neurodegenerative diseases, including AD. To facilitate the clinical application of Treg therapy, we developed a Treg preparation protocol and highlighted the therapeutic effects of Tregs in 5xFAD mice. CD4+CD25+ Tregs, isolated after Abeta stimulation and expanded using a G-rex plate with a gas-permeable membrane, were adoptively transferred into 5xFAD mice. Behavioral analysis was conducted using Y-maze and passive avoidance tests. Additionally, we measured levels of Abeta, phosphorylated tau (pTAU), and nitric oxide synthase 2 (NOS2) in the hippocampus. Real-time RT-PCR was employed to assess the mRNA levels of pro- and anti-inflammatory markers. Our findings indicate that Abeta-specific Tregs not only improved cognitive function but also reduced Abeta and pTAU accumulation in the hippocampus of 5xFAD mice. They also inhibited microglial neuroinflammation. These effects were observed at doses as low as 1.5 x 103 cells/head. Collectively, our results demonstrate that Abeta-specific Tregs can mitigate AD pathology in 5xFAD mice.
