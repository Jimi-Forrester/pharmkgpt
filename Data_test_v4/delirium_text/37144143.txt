37144143|t|Effect of Repeated Intranasal Administration of Different Doses of Insulin on Postoperative Delirium, Serum tau and Abeta Protein in Elderly Patients Undergoing Radical Esophageal Cancer Surgery.
37144143|a|Objective: Postoperative delirium is common after general anesthesia in older patients. However, there are currently no effective preventive measures. This study investigated the effect of repeated intranasal administration of different insulin doses before surgery on postoperative delirium in older patients with esophageal cancer, and the possible mechanism for its efficacy. Methods: In this randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group study, 90 older patients were randomly assigned to either a Control (normal saline), Insulin 1 (20 U/0.5 mL intranasal insulin), or Insulin 2 (30 U/0.75 mL intranasal insulin) group. Delirium was assessed on postoperative days 1 (T2), 2 (T3), and 3 (T4) using the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit. Serum tau and Abeta protein levels were measured at T0 (before insulin/saline administration), T1 (end of surgery), T2, T3 and T4. Results: The Insulin 2 group had a significantly lower prevalence of delirium compared to the Control and Insulin 1 groups three days after surgery. Compared to baseline, tau and Abeta protein levels increased significantly at T1-T4. Compared to the Control group, the Insulin 1 and 2 groups had significantly lower tau and Abeta protein levels at T1-T4, and the Insulin 2 group had significantly lower levels than the Insulin 1 group at T1-T2. Conclusion: The administration of 30 U of intranasal insulin twice daily, from 2 days preoperatively until 10 minutes preanesthesia on the day of surgery, can significantly reduce postoperative delirium in older patients undergoing radical esophagectomy. It can also decrease postoperative tau and Abeta protein expression without causing hypoglycemia.
