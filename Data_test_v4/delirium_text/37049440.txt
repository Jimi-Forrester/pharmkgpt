37049440|t|Skin Autofluorescence Mirrors Surrogate Parameters of Vascular Aging: An Enable Study.
37049440|a|Advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) are implicated in vascular aging due to their pro-inflammatory properties. Skin autofluorescence (SAF) is a measure to estimate their deposition. It is an easily quantifiable marker that has been shown to correlate with cardiovascular risk and parameters of metabolic diseases. Herein, we compared skin autofluorescence with other techniques indicating increased cardiovascular diseases, namely, pulse wave velocity (PWVao) and intima-media thickness (IMT). We also studied the impacts of other parameters in deeply phenotyped cohorts of young, middle-aged, and older individuals. SAF, aortic PWVao, and IMT proved to be significantly correlated with each other and with age. However, based on a moderator analysis, we could not show that these associations were affected by age. Some specific parameters such as creatinine and CRP were found to be significantly associated with skin AGE values after adjusting for confounding variables. In conclusion, SAF is a simple screening tool for vascular health with comparable power to more elaborated technical tests.
