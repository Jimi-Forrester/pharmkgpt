34122343|a|In mammals, myeloid cells help maintain the homeostasis of peripheral metabolic tissues, and their immunologic dysregulation contributes to the progression of obesity and associated metabolic disease. There is accumulating evidence that innate immune cells also serve as functional regulators within the mediobasal hypothalamus (MBH), a critical brain region controlling both energy and glucose homeostasis. Specifically, microglia, the resident parenchymal myeloid cells of the CNS, play important roles in brain physiology and pathology. Recent studies have revealed an expanding array of microglial functions beyond their established roles as immune sentinels, including roles in brain development, circuit refinement, and synaptic organization. We showed that microglia modulate MBH function by transmitting information resulting from excess nutrient consumption. For instance, microglia can sense the excessive consumption of saturated fats and instruct neurons within the MBH accordingly, leading to responsive alterations in energy balance. Interestingly, the recent emergence of high-resolution single-cell techniques has enabled specific microglial populations and phenotypes to be profiled in unprecedented detail. Such techniques have highlighted specific subsets of microglia notable for their capacity to regulate the expression of lipid metabolic genes, including lipoprotein lipase (LPL), apolipoprotein E (APOE) and Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid Cells 2 (TREM2). The discovery of this transcriptional signature highlights microglial lipid metabolism as a determinant of brain health and disease pathogenesis, with intriguing implications for the treatment of brain disorders and potentially metabolic disease. Here we review our current understanding of how changes in microglial lipid metabolism could influence the hypothalamic control of systemic metabolism.
