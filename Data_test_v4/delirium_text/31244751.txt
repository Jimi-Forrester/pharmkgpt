31244751|a|Objective: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the potential diagnostic benefit of SPM-based semi-quantitative FDG-PET analysis in autoimmune encephalitis (AE) compared with visual analysis by experienced neuroradiologists using a larger sample size. Methods: This observational retrospective case series study was conducted from a tertiary epilepsy center between May 2014 and March 2017. Healthy individuals without any neurologic or psychiatric diseases were recruited as control. We determined brain FDG-PET abnormal glucose metabolism on medial temporal lobe and basal ganglia using semi-quantitative analysis and compared this method with visual analysis at the same time among patients with autoantibody positive AE. Results: Twenty-eight patients with clinically diagnosed AE and 53 healthy individuals without any neurologic or psychiatric diseases were recruited. On the medial temporal lobe and the basal ganglia, semi-quantitative analysis showed consistency with the visual assessment for whom they had abnormal metabolism by visual assessment. More importantly, 56% patients on medial temporal lobe and 73% patients on the basal ganglia respectively who were not identified by visual inspection can be detected by semi-quantitative analysis, demonstrating the greater sensitivity of semi-quantitative analysis compared with visual assessment. Significance: This study showed semi-quantitative brain FDG-PET analysis was better than visual analysis in view of observing the abnormal glucose metabolism of patients with autoantibody positive AE. Semi-quantitative FDG-PET analysis appears to be a helpful tool in early diagnosis of patients with AE.
