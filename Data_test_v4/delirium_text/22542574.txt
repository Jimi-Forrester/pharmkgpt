22542574|t|Protein-oxidized phospholipid interactions in cellular signaling for cell death: from biophysics to clinical correlations.
22542574|a|Oxidative stress is associated with several major ailments. However, it is only recently that the developments in our molecular level understanding of the consequences of oxidative stress in modifying the chemical structures of biomolecules, lipids in particular, are beginning to open new emerging insights into the significance of oxidative stress in providing mechanistic insights into the etiologies of these diseases. In this brief review we will first discuss the role of lipid oxidation in controlling the membrane binding of cytochrome c, a key protein in the control of apoptosis. We then present an overview of the impact of oxidized phospholipids on the biophysical properties of lipid bilayers and continue to discuss, how these altered properties can account for the observed enhancement of formation of intermediate state oligomers by cytotoxic amyloid forming peptides associated with pathological conditions as well as host defense peptides of innate immunity. In the third part, we will discuss how the targeting of oxidized phospholipids by i) pathology associated peptides and ii) host defense peptides can readily explain the observed clinical correlations associating Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases with increased risk for type 2 diabetes and age-related macular degeneration, and the apparent protective effect of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases from some cancers, as well as the inverse, apparent protection by cancer from Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Oxidized phospholipids-Their properties and interactions with proteins.
