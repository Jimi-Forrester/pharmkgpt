36212244|a|Objective: The aim of the study is to investigate the influencing factors of quality of life in adult patients with epilepsy in Wenzhou in China. Methods: A total of 190 patients who visited our hospital from July 2019 to February 2021 were included in the study. Demographic data and disease status were collected. Moreover, QOLIE-31, PSQI, ESS, HAMD-17, and GAD-7 were used in the questionnaire survey. Structural equation model fitting was used to analyze the influencing factors of quality of life in adult patients with epilepsy. Results: The scores of the dimension of onset worry in men were greater than those of women (P = 0.049), and the scores of the dimension of life satisfaction were lower than women (P = 0.047). The scores of cognitive function decreased with age (P = 0.047). The scores of quality of life of unemployed and drinking patients significantly decreased (P < 0.05). The score of quality of life positively correlated with good economic status and family relations (P < 0.05). The score of emotional health increased first and then decreased with the course of the disease. With the decrease in seizure frequency and the extension of months without a seizure, the score of quality of life gradually increased. Furthermore, the structural equation model showed that health status was directly correlated to the quality of life of patients with epilepsy. Conclusion: Male, unemployment, drinking, older age, and disease are negatively related to the quality of life in patients with epilepsy. However, good economic status, good family relations, and good colleague relationships are positively related to the quality of life.
