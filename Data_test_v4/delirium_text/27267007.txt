27267007|t|New cinnamic - N-benzylpiperidine and cinnamic - N,N-dibenzyl(N-methyl)amine hybrids as Alzheimer-directed multitarget drugs with antioxidant, cholinergic, neuroprotective and neurogenic properties.
27267007|a|Here we describe new families of multi-target directed ligands obtained by linking antioxidant cinnamic-related structures with N-benzylpiperidine (NBP) or N,N-dibenzyl(N-methyl)amine (DBMA) fragments. Resulting hybrids, in addition to their antioxidant and neuroprotective properties against mitochondrial oxidative stress, are active at relevant molecular targets in Alzheimer's disease, such as cholinesterases (hAChE and hBuChE) and monoamine oxidases (hMAO-A and hMAO-B). Hybrids derived from umbellic - NBP (8), caffeic - NBP (9), and ferulic - DBMA (12) displayed balanced biological profiles, with IC50s in the low-micromolar and submicromolar range for hChEs and hMAOs, and an antioxidant potency comparable to vitamin E. Moreover, the caffeic - NBP hybrid 9 is able to improve the differentiation of adult SGZ-derived neural stem cells into a neuronal phenotype in vitro.
