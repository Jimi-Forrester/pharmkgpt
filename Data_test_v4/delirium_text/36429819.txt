36429819|a|Nearly 350,000 lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer/questioning (LGBTQ+) adults in the U.S. are currently living with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). Informal caregivers face challenges impacting their ability to access and receive adequate and inclusive care for LGBTQ+ persons living with ADRD. The purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility and acceptability of the Savvy Caregiver Program for caregivers of LGBTQ+ individuals living with ADRD. Data for this secondary analysis come from caregivers (n = 17) who completed 6 sessions of the Savvy program. Caregivers were very satisfied with tailored program activities. Analyses of trends suggest non-significant increases in positive aspects of caregiving and decreases in caregiver burden and depressive symptoms. This is the first known study assessing the feasibility of the Savvy Caregiver Program for caregivers of LGBTQ+ individuals living with ADRD. Future research on the Savvy Caregiver Program for caregivers of LGBTQ+ people living with ADRD is needed.
