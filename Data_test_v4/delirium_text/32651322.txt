32651322|t|The Effects of Propofol and Sevoflurane on Postoperative Delirium in Older Patients: A Randomized Clinical Trial Study.
32651322|a|BACKGROUND: Postoperative delirium is associated with adverse postoperative outcomes. However, whether intravenous and inhalation anesthetics are associated with different risks of postoperative delirium remains unknown. OBJECTIVE: We set up to determine the incidence and duration of postoperative delirium in older patients who had surgery under the intravenous anesthetic propofol or the inhalational anesthetic sevoflurane. METHODS: Participants were patients who had total hip/knee replacements and were randomized to propofol (N = 106) or sevoflurane (N = 103) anesthesia group. The Confusion Assessment Method was employed by investigators who were blinded to the anesthesia regimen to assess the incidence and duration (days of postoperative delirium per person) of postoperative delirium on postoperative days 1, 2, and 3. RESULTS: A total of 209 participants (71.2+-6.7 years old, 29.2% male) were included in the final data analysis. The incidence of postoperative delirium was 33.0% with propofol anesthesia and 23.3% with sevoflurane anesthesia (p = 0.119, Chi-square test), and we estimated that we would need 316 participants in each arm to detect a potential statistically significant difference. Days of postoperative delirium per person were higher in the propofol (0.5+-0.8) anesthesia group compared to the sevoflurane anesthesia group (0.3+-0.5, p = 0.049, Student's t-test). CONCLUSION: This pilot study established a system to compare effects of different anesthetics and generated a hypothesis that propofol trended to have a higher incidence and had longer duration of postoperative delirium than sevoflurane. Additional studies with a larger sample size are needed to test this hypothesis.
