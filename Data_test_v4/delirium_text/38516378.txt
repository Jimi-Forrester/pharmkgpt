38516378|t|Searching for gene-gene interactions through variance quantitative trait loci of 29 continuous Taiwan Biobank phenotypes.
38516378|a|Introduction: After the era of genome-wide association studies (GWAS), thousands of genetic variants have been identified to exhibit main effects on human phenotypes. The next critical issue would be to explore the interplay between genes, the so-called "gene-gene interactions" (GxG) or epistasis. An exhaustive search for all single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) pairs is not recommended because this will induce a harsh penalty of multiple testing. Limiting the search of epistasis on SNPs reported by previous GWAS may miss essential interactions between SNPs without significant marginal effects. Moreover, most methods are computationally intensive and can be challenging to implement genome-wide. Methods: I here searched for GxG through variance quantitative trait loci (vQTLs) of 29 continuous Taiwan Biobank (TWB) phenotypes. A discovery cohort of 86,536 and a replication cohort of 25,460 TWB individuals were analyzed, respectively. Results: A total of 18 nearly independent vQTLs with linkage disequilibrium measure r 2 < 0.01 were identified and replicated from nine phenotypes. 15 significant GxG were found with p-values <1.1E-5 (in the discovery cohort) and false discovery rates <2% (in the replication cohort). Among these 15 GxG, 11 were detected for blood traits including red blood cells, hemoglobin, and hematocrit; 2 for total bilirubin; 1 for fasting glucose; and 1 for total cholesterol (TCHO). All GxG were observed for gene pairs on the same chromosome, except for the APOA5 (chromosome 11)-TOMM40 (chromosome 19) interaction for TCHO. Discussion: This study provided a computationally feasible way to search for GxG genome-wide and applied this approach to 29 phenotypes.
