37452311|t|A necroptosis-related gene signature to predict prognosis and immune features in hepatocellular carcinoma.
37452311|a|BACKGROUND AND AIM: Necroptosis plays an important role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development, recurrence, and immunotherapy tolerance. We aimed to build a new prognostic necroptosis-related gene signature that could be used for survival and immunotherapy prediction in HCC patients. METHODS: We found that necroptosis was associated with HCC progression and survival outcomes and was involved in the immune infiltration of HCC. Multiple bioinformatics methods including WGCNA, LASSO-Cox regression, stepwise Cox regression, and Random Forest and Boruta model analysis, were used to establish a prognostic profile related to necroptosis. The necroptosis-related gene signature was validated in ICGC and GSE14520 datasets. RESULTS: This five-gene signature showed excellent predictive performance and was an independent risk factor for patients' overall survival outcome in the three cohorts. Moreover, this signature was an exact predictor using fewer genes than previous gene signatures. Finally, qRT-PCR and immunohistochemical staining investigations were performed in previously collected fresh frozen tumor tissues from HCC patients and their paracancerous normal tissues, and the results were consistent with the bioinformatics results. We found that LGALS3 not only affected the proliferation and migration ability of HepG2 cells but also affected necroptosis and the expression of inflammatory cytokines. CONCLUSION: In summary, we established and validated an individualized prognostic profile related to necroptosis to forecast the therapeutic response to immune therapy, which might offer a potential non-apoptotic therapeutic target for HCC patients.
