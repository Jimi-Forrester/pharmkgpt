37491856|t|Transcription Factor EB: A Promising Therapeutic Target for Ischemic Stroke.
37491856|a|Transcription factor EB (TFEB) is an important endogenous defensive protein that responds to ischemic stimuli. Acute ischemic stroke is a growing concern due to its high morbidity and mortality. Most survivors suffer from disabilities such as numbness or weakness in an arm or leg, facial droop, difficulty speaking or understanding speech, confusion, impaired balance or coordination, or loss of vision. Although TFEB plays a neuroprotective role, its potential effect on ischemic stroke remains unclear. This article describes the basic structure, regulation of transcriptional activity, and biological roles of TFEB relevant to ischemic stroke. Additionally, we explore the effects of TFEB on the various pathological processes underlying ischemic stroke and current therapeutic approaches. The information compiled here may inform clinical and basic studies on TFEB, which may be an effective therapeutic drug target for ischemic stroke.
