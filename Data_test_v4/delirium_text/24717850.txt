24717850|a|The senescence-accelerated-prone mouse 8 (SAMP8) has been proposed as a suitable, naturally derived animal model for Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the current study, we focus on the problem whether SAMP8 mice show abnormal behavioral and neuropathological signs before they present the characteristic of AD. Our results demonstrated that given the presence of the senescent, behavioral and neuropathological characteristics, the "middle-aged" SAMP8 mice appear to be a suitable and naturally derived animal model for MCI basic research. There is relatively less evidence that androgen may be involved in the pathogenesis of AD. We determined testosterone (T) levels of SAMR1 and SAMP8 mice and found that the marked age-related decrease in serum androgen levels may be one of the risk factors for Alzheimer's dementia. We also evaluated the interventional effect on MCI phase by dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in male SAMP8 mice and found that timely and appropriate androgen intervention can postpone the onset and improve the symptoms of dementia.
