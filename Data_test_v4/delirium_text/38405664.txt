38405664|a|Insulin resistance in brain and amyloidogenesis are principal pathological features of diabetes-related cognitive decline and development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). A growing body of evidence suggests that maintaining glucose under control in diabetic patients is beneficial for preventing AD development. Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors (DDP4is) are a class of novel glucose-lowering medications through increasing insulin excretion and decreasing glucagon levels that have shown neuroprotective potential in recent studies. This review consolidates extant evidence from earlier and new studies investigating the association between DPP4i use, AD, and other cognitive outcomes. Beyond DPP4i's benefits in alleviating insulin resistance and glucose-lowering, underlying mechanisms for the potential neuroprotection with DPP4i medications were categorized into the following sections: (Ferrari et al., Physiol Rev, 2021, 101, 1,047-1,081): the benefits of DPP4is on directly ameliorating the burden of beta-amyloid plaques and reducing the formation of neurofibrillary tangles; DPP4i increasing the bioactivity of neuroprotective DPP4 substrates including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP), and stromal-derived factor-1alpha (SDF-1alpha) etc.; pleiotropic effects of DPP4is on neuronal cells and intracerebral structure including anti-inflammation, anti-oxidation, and anti-apoptosis. We further revisited recently published epidemiological studies that provided supportive data to compliment preclinical evidence. Given that there remains a lack of completed randomized trials that aim at assessing the effect of DPP4is in preventing AD development and progression, this review is expected to provide a useful insight into DPP4 inhibition as a potential therapeutic target for AD prevention and treatment. The evidence is helpful for informing the rationales of future clinical research and guiding evidence-based clinical practice.
