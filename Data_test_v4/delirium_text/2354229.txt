2354229|a|The presence of white matter changes on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which has been referred to by Hachinski (1987) as leukoaraiosis, is frequently noted in elderly individuals in conditions ranging from health to frank dementia. This study involved the use of MRI to document cerebral structure if 41 healthy 50-60-year-old individuals, 28 of whom were offspring of Alzheimer's disease victims. On visual inspection of spin-echo images, 13 of the 28 offspring showed white matter lesions whereas all of the controls were free of leukoaraiosis. This statistically significant difference suggests that the presence of leukoaraiosis might be of importance in understanding changes in the white matter among populations at increased risk for Alzheimer's disease.
