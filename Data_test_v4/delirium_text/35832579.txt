35832579|t|Dexmedetomidine in Children on Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation: Pharmacokinetic Data Exploration Using Previously Published Models.
35832579|a|Background: Dexmedetomidine is a sedative and analgesic increasingly used in children supported with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). No data is available to describe the pharmacokinetics (PK) of dexmedetomidine in this population. Methods: We performed a single-center prospective PK study. Children <18 years old, supported with ECMO, and on a dexmedetomidine infusion as part of their management were prospectively included. PK samples were collected. Dexmedetomidine dosing remained at the discretion of the clinical team. Six population PK models built in pediatrics were selected. Observed concentrations were compared with population predicted concentrations using the PK models. Results: Eight children contributed 30 PK samples. None of the PK models evaluated predicted the concentrations with acceptable precision and bias. Four of the six evaluated models overpredicted the concentrations. The addition of a correction factor on clearance improved models' fit. Two of the evaluated models were not applicable to our whole population age range because of their structure. Conclusion: Most of the evaluated PK models overpredicted the concentrations, potentially indicating increased clearance on ECMO. Population PK models applicable to a broad spectrum of ages and pathologies are more practical in pediatric critical care settings but challenging to develop.
