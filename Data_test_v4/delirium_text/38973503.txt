38973503|a|Introduction: Postoperative agitation is a common complication of sevoflurane anesthesia in children and might lead to self-harm and recovery disruption. This study aimed to compare the prophylactic effect of dexmedetomidine and remifentanil on postoperative agitation after anesthesia with sevoflurane. Methods: In this clinical trial, 60 children aged 2 to 7 years with ASA class I, II, candidates for elective strabismus surgery, were randomly assigned to three groups using block randomization. Patients in the first group D received 0.5 microgr/kg dexmedetomidine, the second group R received 0.1 microgr/kg remifentanil, and another group C received normal saline at the end of anesthesia. Children's agitation degree was measured by the Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium (PAED) scales and the 4-point agitation scale at the time of extubation, entering the recovery room, 10, 20, and 30 minutes after entrance. Data analysis was performed using descriptive and inferential statistical tests. Results: The postoperative agitation and pain were significantly lower among children who received dexmedetomidine compared with those in remifentanil and the control group (p < .001). It was observed that the administration of dexmedetomidine at the end of anesthesia significantly decreased the incidence of postoperative agitation (p < .001). None of the patients in group D had a PAED score of over 12. Conclusion: Based on PAED and the 4-point scales, none of the cases in group D had experienced postoperative agitation; this made a significant statistical difference compared with groups C and R (p-value <. 001). Although both dexmedetomidine and remifentanil can prevent and attenuate postoperative agitation, dexmedetomidine administration seems significantly more effective.
