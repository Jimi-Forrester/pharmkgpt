36286432|a|Ecklonia stolonifera Okamura (ES) is mainly distributed in the coastal areas of the middle Pacific, around Korea and Japan, and has a long-standing edible value. It is rich in various compounds, such as polysaccharides, fatty acids, alginic acid, fucoxanthin, and phlorotannins, among which the polyphenol compound phlorotannins are the main active ingredients. Studies have shown that the extracts and active components of ES exhibit anti-cancer, antioxidant, anti-obesity, anti-diabetic, antibacterial, cardioprotective, immunomodulatory, and other pharmacological properties in vivo and in vitro. Although ES contains a variety of bioactive compounds, it is not widely known and has not been extensively studied. Based on its potential health benefits, it is expected to play an important role in improving the nutritional value of food both economically and medically. Therefore, ES needs to be better understood and developed so that it can be utilized in the development and application of marine medicines, functional foods, bioactive substances, and in many other fields. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the bioactivities and bioactive compounds of ES to promote in-depth research and a reference for the comprehensive utilization of ES in the future.
