38593394|t|Proportion of Community-Dwelling Individuals Older Than 70 Years Eligible for Lecanemab Initiation: The Gothenburg H70 Birth Cohort Study.
38593394|a|OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of individuals with Alzheimer disease (AD) eligible for treatment with the recently FDA-approved lecanemab based on data from a population-based sample of 70-year-olds and extrapolate an estimation of individuals eligible in Europe and the United States. METHODS: Participants from the Gothenburg H70 Birth Cohort Study with clinical data, CSF-amyloid beta 42, and brain MRI analysis were evaluated for eligibility to receive lecanemab treatment according to FDA-approved recommendations, noting factors requiring special consideration. Results were used to extrapolate the number of eligible individuals in Europe and the United States using public demographic data. RESULTS: Thirty (10.3%) of 290 participants met the indication for treatment of whom 18 (6.2%) were eligible and did not present factors requiring special consideration. Our estimate that 6.2% of all 70-year-olds in the full cohort are eligible for treatment extrapolates to an approximation that around 5.9 million Europeans and 2.2 million US residents could be eligible. DISCUSSION: Information on proportion of individuals eligible for AD treatment with lecanemab in the general public is limited. We provide information on 70-year-olds in Sweden and extrapolate these data to Europe and the United States. This study opens for larger studies on this proportion and implementation of lecanemab treatment.
