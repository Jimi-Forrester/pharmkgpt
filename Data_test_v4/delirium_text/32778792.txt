32778792|a|Patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) present with both extracellular amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques and intracellular tau-containing neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. For many years, the prevailing view of AD pathogenesis has been that changes in Abeta precipitate the disease process and initiate a deleterious cascade involving tau pathology and neurodegeneration. Beyond this 'triggering' function, it has been typically presumed that Abeta and tau act independently and in the absence of specific interaction. However, accumulating evidence now suggests otherwise and contends that both pathologies have synergistic effects. This could not only help explain negative results from anti-Abeta clinical trials but also suggest that trials directed solely at tau may need to be reconsidered. Here, drawing from extensive human and disease model data, we highlight the latest evidence base pertaining to the complex Abeta-tau interaction and underscore its crucial importance to elucidating disease pathogenesis and the design of next-generation AD therapeutic trials.
