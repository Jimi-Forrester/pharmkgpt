39284837|t|Higher sodium in older individuals or after stroke/reperfusion, but not in migraine or Alzheimer's disease - a study in different preclinical models.
39284837|a|Sodium serves as one of the primary cations in the central nervous system, playing a crucial role in maintaining normal brain function. In this study, we investigated alterations in sodium concentrations in the brain and/or cerebrospinal fluid across multiple models, including an aging model, a stroke model, a nitroglycerin (NTG)-induced rat migraine model, a familial hemiplegic migraine type 2 (FHM2) mouse model, and a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Our results reveal that older rats exhibited higher sodium concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), plasma, and various brain regions compared to their younger counterparts. Additionally, findings from the stroke model demonstrated a significant increase in sodium in the ischemic/reperfused region, accompanied by a decrease in potassium and an elevated sodium/potassium ratio. However, we did not detect significant changes in sodium in the NTG-induced rat migraine model or the FHM2 mouse model. Furthermore, AD transgenic mice showed no significant differences in sodium levels compared to wild-type mice in CSF, plasma, or the hippocampus. These results underscore the nuanced regulation of sodium homeostasis in various neurological conditions and aging, providing valuable insights into potential mechanisms underlying these alterations.
