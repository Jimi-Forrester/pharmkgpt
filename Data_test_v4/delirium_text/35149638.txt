35149638|t|Promoting Acceptance and Adherence to Noninvasive Ventilation in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease: A Randomized Controlled Trial.
35149638|a|OBJECTIVE: People with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may suffer from anxiety, depression, low quality of life, and cognitive deficits that could play a role in their clinical conditions. These situations could be worsened during the adaptation process to a new treatment such as noninvasive ventilation (NIV), which is often rejected or inappropriately used. The study aimed to analyze the impact of a brief psychological support intervention on adherence to NIV among patients with COPD. METHODS: A two-branch randomized controlled trial was conducted on 90 patients with COPD who had an indication for NIV. The experimental group received cognitive behavioral therapy support, including counseling, relaxation, and mindfulness-based exercises. Controls received standard care and watched educational videos. The course had been structured for four to eight meetings at the hospital, at home, and/or via telemedicine. RESULTS: The psychological intervention was related to improvements in both adherence to NIV (F(304) = 19.054, p < .001) and quality of life (F(156) = 10.264, p = .002) after eight meetings from baseline compared with the control group. Results indicated a significant change in the quality of life also over time (F(71.480) = 8.114, p = .006). CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that the psychological intervention is an appropriate treatment for acceptance of and adherence to NIV in COPD in clinical practice and highlight the importance of determining the underlying reasons for NIV use.Trial Registration:ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02499653.
