We investigated sex-specific associations between genetic variation and opioid response. We identified participants in the RIGHT Study prescribed codeine, tramadol, hydrocodone, and oxycodone between 01/01/2005 and 12/31/2017. Prescriptions were collapsed into codeine/tramadol and hydrocodone/oxycodone. Outcomes included poor pain control and adverse reactions within six weeks after prescription date. We performed gene-level and single-variant association analyses stratified by sex. We included 7169 non-Hispanic white participants and a total of 1940 common and low-frequency variants (MAF > 0.01). Common variants in MACROD2 (rs76026520), CYP1B1 (rs1056837, rs1056836), and CYP2D6 (rs35742686) were associated with outcomes. At the gene level, FAAH, SCN1A, and TYMS had associations for men and women, and NAT2, CYP3A4, CYP1A2, and SLC22A2 had associations for men only. Our findings highlight the importance of considering sex in association studies on opioid response.
