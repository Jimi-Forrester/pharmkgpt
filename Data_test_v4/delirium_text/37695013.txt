37695013|t|Delirium is associated with loss of feedback cortical connectivity.
37695013|a|INTRODUCTION: Post-operative delirium (POD) is associated with increased morbidity and mortality but is bereft of treatments, largely due to our limited understanding of the underlying pathophysiology. We hypothesized that delirium reflects a disturbance in cortical connectivity that leads to altered predictions of the sensory environment. METHODS: High-density electroencephalogram recordings during an oddball auditory roving paradigm were collected from 131 patients. Dynamic causal modeling (DCM) analysis facilitated inference about the neuronal connectivity and inhibition-excitation dynamics underlying auditory-evoked responses. RESULTS: Mismatch negativity amplitudes were smaller in patients with POD. DCM showed that delirium was associated with decreased left-sided superior temporal gyrus (l-STG) to auditory cortex feedback connectivity. Feedback connectivity also negatively correlated with delirium severity and systemic inflammation. Increased inhibition of l-STG, with consequent decreases in feed-forward and feed-back connectivity, occurred for oddball tones during delirium. DISCUSSION: Delirium is associated with decreased feedback cortical connectivity, possibly resulting from increased intrinsic inhibitory tone. HIGHLIGHTS: Mismatch negativity amplitude was reduced in patients with delirium. Patients with postoperative delirium had increased feedforward connectivity before surgery. Feedback connectivity was diminished from left-side superior temporal gyrus to left primary auditory sensory area during delirium. Feedback connectivity inversely correlated with inflammation and delirium severity.
