36312618|t|A Wolf in Hiding: Epilepsy and Post-ictal Psychosis As Unrecognized Presenting Features of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus.
36312618|a|Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disorder that affects multiple organ systems. Many patients present with neurological and psychiatric signs and symptoms at some point in the course of the disease. Here, we present a patient with neuropsychiatric SLE (NPSLE) who presented with long-standing and difficult-to-control epileptic seizures and post-ictal psychotic symptoms prior to the diagnosis of SLE. A 39-year-old patient with a ten-year history of uncontrolled epileptic seizures despite multiple medications and recent diagnosis of chronic kidney disease presented to the emergency department following multiple witnessed seizures. Her seizures were controlled following initial interventions and the patient was admitted to the hospital to control metabolic acidosis and hyperkalemia. Later, the patient developed psychosis with auditory hallucinations, combative behavior, and agitation which were controlled with restraints and sedatives. Initial serological and urinary studies revealed disturbances of multiple systems and triggered broad workup resulting in positive serological SLE markers. The patient was then started on immunosuppressive medications with prompt control of post-ictal psychosis. The patient was discharged with immunosuppressive regimen and control of her seizures. This case highlights that signs and symptoms of NPSLE may appear before the onset of SLE diagnosis. Additionally, our patient had long-standing epilepsy with post-ictal psychosis, which has not been reported in the literature before. We believe this case highlights the challenges in the diagnosis of NPSLE, the rapid control of seizures and/or psychosis with SLE treatment, and the necessity to broaden the differential diagnosis in atypical presentation of seizures and/or psychosis.
