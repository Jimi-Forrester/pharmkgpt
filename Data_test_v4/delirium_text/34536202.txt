34536202|t|Generation and characterization of a tractable C. elegans model of tauopathy.
34536202|a|Alzheimer's disease(AD) is an age-associated neurodegenerative disease that results in deterioration of memory and cognitive function. As a currently untreatable disorder, AD has emerged as one of the defining biomedical challenges of our time. Thus, new approaches that can examine the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying age-related AD pathology are sorely needed. One of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease is the hyperphosphorylation of the tau protein. Caenorhabditis elegans have been previously used to study the genetic pathways impacted by tau proteotoxic stress; however, currently, available C. elegans tau models express the human protein solely in neurons, which are unresponsive to global RNA interference (RNAi). This limits powerful RNAi screening methods from being utilized effectively in these disease models. Our goal was to develop a C. elegans tau model that has pronounced tau-induced disease phenotypes in cells that can be modified by feeding RNAi methods. Towards this end, we generated a novel C. elegans transgenic line with codon-optimized human 0N4R V337M tau expressed in the body wall muscle under the myo-3 promoter. Immunoblotting experiments revealed that the expressed tau is phosphorylated on epitopes canonically associated with human AD pathology. The tau line has significantly reduced health metrics, including egg laying, growth rate, paralysis, thrashing frequency, crawling speed, and lifespan. These defects are suppressed by RNAi directed against the tau mRNA. Taken together, our results suggest that this alternative tau genetic model could be a useful tool for uncovering the mechanisms that influence the hyperphosphorylation and toxicity of human tau via RNAi screening and other approaches.
