38927737|t|Genome-Wide Characterization of Somatic Mutation Patterns in Cloned Dogs Reveals Implications for Neuronal Function, Tumorigenesis, and Aging.
38927737|a|Studies on somatic mutations in cloned animals have revealed slight genetic variances between clones and their originals, but have yet to identify the precise effects of these differences within the organism. Somatic mutations contribute to aging and are implicated in tumor development and other age-related diseases. Thus, we compared whole genome sequencing data from an original dog with that of cloned dogs, identifying candidate somatic mutations that were disproportionately located within genes previously implicated in aging. The substitutional signature of cloning-specific somatic mutations mirrored the uniform distribution characteristic of the signature associated with human aging. Further analysis of genes revealed significant enrichment of traits associated with body size as well as the molecular mechanisms underlying neuronal function and tumorigenesis. Overall, the somatic mutations found in cloned dogs may indicate a conserved mechanism driving aging across species and a broad spectrum of pathway alterations.
