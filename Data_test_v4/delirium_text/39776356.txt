39776356|t|Relationship of Autophagic Dysfunction With the Quality of Life and Sleep, Depression and Disease Severity in Patients With Restless Legs Syndrome.
39776356|a|INTRODUCTION: Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a frequently encountered neurological illness that has no effective treatment and imposes an enormous socioeconomic burden. Autophagy is essential for the maintenance of healthy cellular physiology, cell viability, and defense against pathogenic conditions. However, there is no study investigating the possible role of autophagy-related proteins (ATGs) in RLS patients. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the expression and diagnostic potential of ATG3 and ATG5, as well as the relationships between these proteins and laboratory markers, depression, disease score, quality of life, and sleep in RLS patients. METHODS: A total of 49 patients with RLS and 26 healthy individuals were recruited for the current study. The severity of the disease was assessed using the international RLS rating scale. All participants were administered the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, the Quality-of-Life Scale, and the Beck Depression Inventory. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was employed to quantify the expressions of ATG3 and ATG5. RESULTS: Serum ATG3 and ATG5 expressions were significantly upregulated in RLS patients compared to healthy controls (p = 0.005) and upregulated ATG3 and ATG5 expressions were relationship with the severity of the disease (p < 0.05). ATG3 was substantially correlated with the quality of sleep, whereas ATG5 was correlated with the quality of life and depression status (p < 0.05). The ROC curve analysis demonstrated that ATG3 expressions over 3146.5 ng/mL and ATG5 expressions over 4732.5 ng/mL may predict the presence of RLS (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: We report for the first time that autophagy may have a significant impact on the development of RLS.
