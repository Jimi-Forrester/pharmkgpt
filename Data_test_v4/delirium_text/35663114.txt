35663114|t|A machine learning approach to identifying delirium from electronic health records.
35663114|a|The identification of delirium in electronic health records (EHRs) remains difficult due to inadequate assessment or under-documentation. The purpose of this research is to present a classification model that identifies delirium using retrospective EHR data. Delirium was confirmed with the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit. Age, sex, Elixhauser comorbidity index, drug exposures, and diagnoses were used as features. The model was developed based on the Columbia University Irving Medical Center EHR data and further validated with the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III dataset. Seventy-six patients from Surgical/Cardiothoracic ICU were included in the model. The logistic regression model achieved the best performance in identifying delirium; mean AUC of 0.874 +- 0.033. The mean positive predictive value of the logistic regression model was 0.80. The model promises to identify delirium cases with EHR data, thereby enable a sustainable infrastructure to build a retrospective cohort of delirium.
