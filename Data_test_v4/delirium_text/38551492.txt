38551492|a|Micromotor (MM) technology offers a valuable and smart on-the-move biosensing microscale approach in clinical settings where sample availability is scarce in the case of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Soluble amyloid-beta protein oligomers (AbetaO) (mainly AbetaO42) that circulate in biological fluids have been recognized as a molecular biomarker and therapeutic target of AD due to their high toxicity, and they are correlated much more strongly with AD compared to the insoluble Abeta monomers. A graphene oxide (GO)-gold nanoparticles (AuNPs)/nickel (Ni)/platinum nanoparticles (PtNPs) micromotors (MMGO-AuNPs)-based electrochemical label-free aptassay is proposed for sensitive, accurate, and rapid determination of AbetaO42 in complex clinical samples such as brain tissue, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and plasma from AD patients. An approach that implies the in situ formation of AuNPs on the GO external layer of tubular MM in only one step during MM electrosynthesis was performed (MMGO-AuNPs). The AbetaO42 specific thiolated-aptamer (AptAbetaO42) was immobilized in the MMGO-AuNPs via Au-S interaction, allowing for the selective recognition of the AbetaO42 (MMGO-AuNPs-AptAbetaO42-AbetaO42). AuNPs were smartly used not only to covalently bind a specific thiolated-aptamer for the design of a label-free electrochemical aptassay but also to improve the final MM propulsion performance due to their catalytic activity (approximately 2.0x speed). This on-the-move bioplatform provided a fast (5 min), selective, precise (RSD < 8%), and accurate quantification of AbetaO42 (recoveries 94-102%) with excellent sensitivity (LOD = 0.10 pg mL-1) and wide linear range (0.5-500 pg mL-1) in ultralow volumes of the clinical sample of AD patients (5 muL), without any dilution. Remarkably, our MM-based bioplatform demonstrated the competitiveness for the determination of AbetaO42 in the target samples against the dot blot analysis, which requires more than 14 h to provide qualitative results only. It is also important to highlight its applicability to the potential analysis of liquid biopsies as plasma and CSF samples, improving the reliability of the diagnosis given the heterogeneity and temporal complexity of neurodegenerative diseases. The excellent results obtained demonstrate the analytical potency of our approach as a future tool for clinical/POCT (Point-of-care testing) routine scenarios.
