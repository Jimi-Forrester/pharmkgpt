19639019|t|Depletion of potential A2M risk haplotype for Alzheimer's disease in long-lived individuals.
19639019|a|Risk alleles for age-related diseases are expected to decrease in frequency in the population strata of increasing age. Consistent with this hypothesis, earlier studies showed a depletion of the Alzheimer's disease risk factor APOE*epsilon4 in long-lived individuals (LLIs). To evaluate whether this observation also holds for a previously suggested Alzheimer's disease risk haplotype in the A2M gene, we analyzed this particular haplotype in 1042 German LLIs (aged 95-100 years) and 1040 younger individuals (aged 60-75 years). Our results show a significant depletion of this haplotype in LLIs, thus confirming it as a mortality factor in the elderly. Consequently, our data support an involvement of the suggested A2M risk haplotype in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease and adds new evidence to the risk-allele depletion hypothesis.
