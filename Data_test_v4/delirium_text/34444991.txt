34444991|t|A Review of the Properties of Anthocyanins and Their Influence on Factors Affecting Cardiometabolic and Cognitive Health.
34444991|a|The incidence of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases has increased over the last decades and is an important cause of death worldwide. An upcoming ingredient on the nutraceutical market are anthocyanins, a flavonoid subgroup, abundant mostly in berries and fruits. Epidemiological studies have suggested an association between anthocyanin intake and improved cardiovascular risk, type 2 diabetes and myocardial infarct. Clinical studies using anthocyanins have shown a significant decrease in inflammation markers and oxidative stress, a beneficial effect on vascular function and hyperlipidemia by decreasing low-density lipoprotein and increasing high-density lipoprotein. They have also shown a potential effect on glucose homeostasis and cognitive decline. This review summarizes the effects of anthocyanins in in-vitro, animal and human studies to give an overview of their application in medical prevention or as a dietary supplement.
