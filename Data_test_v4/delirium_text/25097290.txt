25097290|a|Though there is ample evidence for the association between selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and hyponatremia, evidence for the relationship between mirtazapine and hyponatremia is scarce. We present a case of mirtazapine-induced hyponatremia in an adult patient, which was dose related.
