31878896|a|BACKGROUND: Somatic symptoms are commonly reported by patients on maintenance hemodialysis. Based on evidence that exercise can improve psychological state among the general population, we aimed to evaluate the effects of physical activity on somatic symptoms specifically in this clinical population. METHODS: This was a multicenter, cross-sectional study that included patients receiving hemodialysis treatment >=3 times per week for > 3 months, aged 18 years or older, and who were willing to complete our study questionnaires and wear a pedometer; they were recruited from four hemodialysis centers in Zhejiang, China. Physical activity was quantified using pedometer data, with somatic symptoms quantified using the Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90). Hemodialysis information and blood laboratory tests were obtained from patients' medical record. The score on the somatic dimension of the SCL-90 (S1-score) subdivided into tertiles for analysis: <=1.17 (Q1), 1.17-1.58 (Q2) and >= 1.58 (Q3). A multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to estimate the crude and adjusted odd ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the S1- somatic score according to the physical activity level during the last week. For this analysis, patients were stratified in a high and low exercise group using a cutoff of 3000 MET-min/week. Model 1 was adjusted for skinfold thickness of the triceps, upper arm circumference, grip strength, 5-m walking time, and 30-s sit-to-stand test. In model 2, we further adjusted for the leukocyte count, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level, and albumin level. RESULTS: After screening, 320 patients were enrolled into the study group (37.50% male, average age of 58.60 +- 14.2 years and mean average number of steps per day of 3725.92 +- 2663.47). The S1-score (1.51 +- 0.39) was significantly higher for patients than for the normal reference population (P < 0.001). As the S1-score increased, the average number of steps per day decreased, both on dialysis and non-dialysis days. Total physical activity, measured by pedometry, showed the best correlation to S1 scores (r = - 0.813; P < 0.01). The OR of a high S1-score was 1.97 [95% CI, 0.63-4.08] for patients in the low physical activity group. CONCLUSION: Higher S1 (somatic symptom) score was related to low physical activity among patients on maintenance hemodialysis.
