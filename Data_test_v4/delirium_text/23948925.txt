23948925|a|Beta-secretase is the first cleavage enzyme of amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP) in the amyloidogenic pathway, leading to the formation of the plaque forming Amyloid-beta (Abeta)1-42 peptide. BACE (beta-site AbetaPP cleaving enzyme) 1 inhibition is therefore considered to be a promising disease modifying therapy for Alzheimer's disease. An early assessment of the in vivo activity of BACE inhibitors was done in dogs since AbetaPP processing is the same as in humans and this species easily enables longitudinal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sampling. Abeta changes in CSF compared to baseline are used to evaluate target engagement of the compounds. Levels of Abeta1-37, Abeta1-38, Abeta1-40, and Abeta1-42 in CSF are measured with immunoassay (Mesoscale electrochemiluminescence technology) and with an ultra high-performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). Two experimental BACE inhibitors were evaluated. With the immunoassay, a dose dependent decrease is observed for all four Abeta peptides. Measurements with the UPLC-MS/MS are in line with the immunoassay for Abeta1-37, Abeta1-38, and Abeta1-40, however, for Abeta1-42, differences are sometimes observed when comparing to changes seen in the other peptides with UPLC-MS/MS and with immunoassay results. Generally lower concentrations are measured with immunoassay. The reason for these differences is still unknown. Abeta1-42 is more prone to form aggregates compared to the other peptides. One hypothesis could be that while the immunoassay only measures free Abeta, bound and aggregated Abeta peptides are at least partially dissolved with the UPLC-MS/MS method, since acetonitrile is added to the CSF samples. This increases variability in the concentration of Abeta peptide measured with UPLC-MS/MS, especially for Abeta1-42, potentially masking the compound effect on Abeta1-42 levels.
