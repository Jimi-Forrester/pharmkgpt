38532744|t|The Use of Preoperative Video Distraction on Emergence Delirium in Preschool Children Undergoing Strabismus Surgery Under Anesthesia with Sevoflurane: A Randomized Controlled Trial.
38532744|a|Purpose: The aim of this study was to determine whether preoperative video distraction reduces the incidence of emergence delirium in preschool children under general anesthesia with sevoflurane. Patients and Methods: In this prospective randomized controlled study, children aged 3-6 years were randomized to receive either video distraction (Group V) or common clinical practice (Group C) from arrival at the holding area to induction of anesthesia. The primary outcome was the incidence of emergence delirium. Preoperative anxiety scores, assessed by the simple modified Yale Perioperative Anxiety Scale, were also collected. Results: A total of 160 patients were included in our study. The children in Group V (n=80) exhibited a significantly lower incidence of emergence delirium than did those in Group C (n=80) (12.5% vs 35.0%; RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.19, 0.69; P =0.0008). The maximum Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium score in Group V was significantly lower than that in Group C (3.0 vs 5.0; mean difference -2.64, 95% CI: -4.12, -1.16; P=0.0003). The simple modified Yale Perioperative Anxiety Scale scores at separation from parents and the onset of inhalation induction in Group V were significantly lower than those in Group C (36.4 +- 9.9 vs 48.2 +- 16.7; mean difference 11.92, 95% CI 7.25, 16.59; P<0.0001 and 41.5 +- 15.9 vs 59.7 +- 21.5; mean difference 18.11, 95% CI 11.76, 24.47; P<0.0001). Conclusion: Preoperative video distraction reduces the incidence of emergence delirium in preschool children who undergo strabismus surgery under general anesthesia with sevoflurane.
