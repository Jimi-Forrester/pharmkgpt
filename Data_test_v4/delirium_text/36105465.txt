36105465|a|Silk cocoon, naturally produced by silkworms scientifically named Bombyx mori L. (Lepidoptera, Bombycidae), is one of the well-known medicinal agents with several therapeutic activities. The present study aims to review the various aspects of the silk cocoon, including chemical composition, traditional uses, biological and biotechnological activities, and toxicological issues, to provide a scientific source for scholars. For this purpose, Electronic databases including PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and traditional literature, were searched up to December 2021. According to the historical data, silk farming is acknowledged as one of the most ancient agricultural findings. The silk is generally composed of 75-83% fibroin, 17-25% sericin, and 1-5% non-sericin components, including secondary metabolites, wax, pigments, carbohydrates, and other impurities. Flavonoids, especially quercetin and kaempferol, alkaloids, coumarin derivatives, and phenolic acids, are among the secondary metabolites isolated from the silk cocoon. In recent years the biological properties of the silk cocoon, especially its major proteins, namely fibroin and sericin, have drawn special attention. Scientific literature has investigated several pharmacological effects of the silk cocoon and its ingredients, including cardioprotective, antioxidant, anticancer, antidiabetic, antihyperlipidemia, gastroprotective, as well as ameliorated skin health activities. In addition, it has been extensively taken into consideration in drug delivery and tissue engineering study fields. Furthermore, its toxicity is in acceptable range.
