28585125|t|Role of microtubule-associated protein tau phosphorylation in Alzheimer's disease.
28585125|a|As a major microtubule-associated protein, tau plays an important role in promoting microtubule assembly and stabilizing microtubules. In Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other tauopathies, the abnormally hyperphosphorylated tau proteins are aggregated into paired helical filaments and accumulated in the neurons with the form of neurofibrillary tangles. An imbalanced regulation in protein kinases and protein phosphatases is the direct cause of tau hyperphosphorylation. Among various kinases and phosphatases, glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) are the most implicated. Accumulation of the hyperphosphorylated tau induces synaptic toxicity and cognitive impairments. Here, we review the upstream factors or pathways that can regulate GSK-3beta or PP2A activity mainly based on our recent findings. We will also discuss the mechanisms that may underlie tau-induced synaptic toxicity.
