34814918|t|Three decades of Cdk5.
34814918|a|Cdk5 is a proline-directed serine/threonine protein kinase that governs a variety of cellular processes in neurons, the dysregulation of which compromises normal brain function. The mechanisms underlying the modulation of Cdk5, its modes of action, and its effects on the nervous system have been a great focus in the field for nearly three decades. In this review, we provide an overview of the discovery and regulation of Cdk5, highlighting recent findings revealing its role in neuronal/synaptic functions, circadian clocks, DNA damage, cell cycle reentry, mitochondrial dysfunction, as well as its non-neuronal functions under physiological and pathological conditions. Moreover, we discuss evidence underscoring aberrant Cdk5 activity as a common theme observed in many neurodegenerative diseases.
