37811347|t|Total intravenous anesthesia management with simultaneous use of remimazolam and propofol: A case series of three patients.
37811347|a|Remimazolam is an ultra-short-acting benzodiazepine anesthetic agent. Because of pharmacodynamic interactions in the sedation effect between benzodiazepines and propofol, the combination of remimazolam and propofol may allow for a dose reduction of each agent while providing effective sedation for general anesthesia. We experienced three cases in which general anesthesia was induced with remimazolam and maintained with relatively small doses of remimazolam and propofol target-controlled infusion. In all cases, electroencephalogram changes associated with sedation induced by remimazolam were carefully observed during anesthesia induction before administration of propofol. The time required for recovery from anesthesia was 8-13 min. This is the first report in which remimazolam and propofol were concomitantly used for general anesthesia based on the concept of pharmacodynamic interaction. This anesthetic combination may be beneficial in reducing doses of each anesthetic and avoiding delayed recovery from anesthesia, although further study is needed to confirm this.
