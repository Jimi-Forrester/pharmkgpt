33042818|a|Central nervous system involvement in Hodgkin lymphoma is extremely rare, especially in nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin lymphoma (NLPHL), which usually carries a favorable prognosis. Here we report a case of a young patient with NLPHL, who developed a progressive and fatal neurological deterioration requiring a very extensive work-up including two biopsies to obtain the diagnosis of T-cell/histiocyte-rich large B-cell lymphoma like transformation. This report, which includes post-mortem analysis, highlights the correlations between clinical, radiological, and biological data but also the difficulties encountered in reaching the correct diagnosis.
