38093573|a|Alzheimer's disease leads to an alteration of decision-making abilities which may increase risk-taking behaviours, particularly associated anosognosia. Anticipating the progression of the disease raises a number of questions, particularly in relation to aging in place. Our qualitative study aimed to identify the arguments used by older patients with Alzheimer's disease when choosing a place to age. The study included 22 older adults, living at home, and diagnosed as mild dementia. The patients' arguments in favour of ageing in place were based mainly on the preservation of internal security, through the familiarity of places and relations as well as the maintenance of their independence and their lifestyle habits, allowing stability in their daily lives. Despite the identification of memory loss, the associated risks were minimized or hidden from the reflection on the choice of the place to age.
