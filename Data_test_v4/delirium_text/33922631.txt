33922631|t|Glycerol Monocaprylate Modulates Gut Microbiota and Increases Short-Chain Fatty Acids Production without Adverse Effects on Metabolism and Inflammation.
33922631|a|Glycerol monocaprylate (GMC) is a glycerol derivative of medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs) and is widely used as a preservative in food processing. However, GMC and its hydrolytic acid (octylic acid) have antibacterial properties that may affect the physiology and intestinal microecology of the human body. Therefore, in this study, the effects of two different dosages of GMC (150 and 1600 mg kg-1) on glucose, lipid metabolism, inflammation, and intestinal microecology of normal diet-fed C57BL/6 mice were comprehensively investigated. The obtained results showed that the level of triglycerides (TGs) in the low-dose group down-regulated significantly, and the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin 10 (IL-10) significantly increased, while the pro-inflammatory cytokines monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1) and interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta) in the high-dose group were significantly decreased. Importantly, GMC promoted the alpha-diversity of gut microbiota in normal-diet-fed mice, regardless of dosages. Additionally, it was found that the low-dose treatment of GMC significantly increased the abundance of Lactobacillus, while the high-dose treatment of GMC significantly increased the abundance of SCFA-producers such as Clostridiales, Lachnospiraceae, and Ruminococcus. Moreover, the content of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) was significantly increased by GMC supplementation. Thus, our research provides a novel insight into the effects of GMC on gut microbiota and physiological characteristics.
