37730639|t|Spinal cord perfusion pressure correlates with breathing function in patients with acute, cervical traumatic spinal cord injuries: an observational study.
37730639|a|OBJECTIVE: This study aims to determine the relationship between spinal cord perfusion pressure (SCPP) and breathing function in patients with acute cervical traumatic spinal cord injuries. METHODS: We included 8 participants without cervical TSCI plus 13 patients with cervical traumatic spinal cord injuries, American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale grades A-C. In the TSCI patients, we monitored intraspinal pressure from the injury site for up to a week and computed the SCPP as mean arterial pressure minus intraspinal pressure. Breathing function was quantified by diaphragmatic electromyography using an EDI (electrical activity of the diaphragm) nasogastric tube as well as by ultrasound of the diaphragm and the intercostal muscles performed when sitting at 20 -30 . RESULTS: We analysed 106 ultrasound examinations (total 1370 images/videos) and 198 EDI recordings in the patients with cervical traumatic spinal cord injuries. During quiet breathing, low SCPP (< 60 mmHg) was associated with reduced EDI-peak (measure of inspiratory effort) and EDI-min (measure of the tonic activity of the diaphragm), which increased and then plateaued at SCPP 60-100 mmHg. During quiet and deep breathing, the diaphragmatic thickening fraction (force of diaphragmatic contraction) plotted versus SCPP had an inverted-U relationship, with a peak at SCPP 80-90 mmHg. Diaphragmatic excursion (up and down movement of the diaphragm) during quiet breathing did not correlate with SCPP, but diaphragmatic excursion during deep breathing plotted versus SCPP had an inverse-U relationship with a peak at SCPP 80-90 mmHg. The thickening fraction of the intercostal muscles plotted versus SCPP also had inverted-U relationship, with normal intercostal function at SCPP 80-100 mmHg, but failure of the upper and middle intercostals to contract during inspiration (i.e. abdominal breathing) at SCPP < 80 or > 100 mmHg. CONCLUSIONS: After acute, cervical traumatic spinal cord injuries, breathing function depends on the SCPP. SCPP 80-90 mmHg correlates with optimum diaphragmatic and intercostal muscle function. Our findings raise the possibility that intervention to maintain SCPP in this range may accelerate ventilator liberation which may reduce stay in the neuro-intensive care unit.
