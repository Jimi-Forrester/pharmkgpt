18854865|t|GAB2 is not associated with late-onset Alzheimer's disease in Japanese.
18854865|a|The varepsilon4 allele of the apolipoprotein E gene (APOE) is unequivocally recognized as a genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). Recently, single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the GRB2-associated binding protein 2 gene (GAB2) were shown to be associated with LOAD in Caucasians carrying the APOE-varepsilon4 allele through a genome-wide association study. Here, we attempted to replicate the finding by genotyping these SNPs in a large clinical cohort of Japanese. We observed no association of any of the SNPs with LOAD. GAB2 may not be a disease susceptibility gene for LOAD in Japanese.
