29067305|a|INTRODUCTION: Vitamin E family, composed by tocopherols and tocotrienols, is a group of compounds with neuroprotective properties. The exact role in the pathogenesis and the benefit of vitamin E as treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD) are still under debate. METHODS: A literature search in PubMed, Medline, and Cochrane databases has been carried out. All types of studies, from bench and animal models to clinical, were included. RESULTS: High plasma vitamin E levels are associated with better cognitive performance, even if clear evidence of their ability to prevent or delay cognitive decline in AD is still lacking. Each vitamin E form is functionally unique and shows specific biological functions. Tocotrienols seem to have superior antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties compared with tocopherols. DISCUSSION: The benefit of vitamin E as a treatment for AD is still under debate, mainly because of the inconsistent findings from observational studies and the methodological limitations of clinical trials.
