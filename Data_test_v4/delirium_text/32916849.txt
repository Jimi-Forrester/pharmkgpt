32916849|t|Anthocyanins, Vibrant Color Pigments, and Their Role in Skin Cancer Prevention.
32916849|a|Until today, numerous studies evaluated the topic of anthocyanins and various types of cancer, regarding the anthocyanins' preventative and inhibitory effects, underlying molecular mechanisms, and such. However, there is no targeted review available regarding the anticarcinogenic effects of dietary anthocyanins on skin cancers. If diagnosed at the early stages, the survival rate of skin cancer is quite high. Nevertheless, the metastatic form has a short prognosis. In fact, the incidence of melanoma skin cancer, the type with high mortality, has increased exponentially over the last 30 years, causing the majority of skin cancer deaths. Malignant melanoma is considered a highly destructive type of skin cancer due to its particular capacity to grow and spread faster than any other type of cancers. Plants, in general, have been used in disease treatment for a long time, and medicinal plants are commonly a part of anticancer drugs on the market. Accordingly, this work primarily aims to emphasize the most recent improvements on the anticarcinogenic effects of anthocyanins from different plant sources, with an in-depth emphasis on melanoma skin cancer. We also briefly summarized the anthocyanin chemistry, their rich dietary sources in flowers, fruits, and vegetables, as well as their associated potential health benefits. Additionally, the importance of anthocyanins in topical applications such as their use in cosmetics is also given.
