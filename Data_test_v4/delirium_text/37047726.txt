37047726|t|NAGS, CPS1, and SLC25A13 (Citrin) at the Crossroads of Arginine and Pyrimidines Metabolism in Tumor Cells.
37047726|a|Urea cycle enzymes and transporters collectively convert ammonia into urea in the liver. Aberrant overexpression of carbamylphosphate synthetase 1 (CPS1) and SLC25A13 (citrin) genes has been associated with faster proliferation of tumor cells due to metabolic reprogramming that increases the activity of the CAD complex and pyrimidine biosynthesis. N-acetylglutamate (NAG), produced by NAG synthase (NAGS), is an essential activator of CPS1. Although NAGS is expressed in lung cancer derived cell lines, expression of the NAGS gene and its product was not evaluated in tumors with aberrant expression of CPS1 and citrin. We used data mining approaches to identify tumor types that exhibit aberrant overexpression of NAGS, CPS1, and citrin genes, and evaluated factors that may contribute to increased expression of the three genes and their products in tumors. Median expression of NAGS, CPS1, and citrin mRNA was higher in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), glioma, and stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) samples compared to the matched normal tissue. Median expression of CPS1 and citrin mRNA was higher in the lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) sample while expression of NAGS mRNA did not differ. High NAGS expression was associated with an unfavorable outcome in patients with glioblastoma and GBM. Low NAGS expression was associated with an unfavorable outcome in patients with LUAD. Patterns of DNase hypersensitive sites and histone modifications in the upstream regulatory regions of NAGS, CPS1, and citrin genes were similar in liver tissue, lung tissue, and A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells despite different expression levels of the three genes in the liver and lung. Citrin gene copy numbers correlated with its mRNA expression in glioblastoma, GBM, LUAD, and STAD samples. There was little overlap between NAGS, CPS1, and citrin sequence variants found in patients with respective deficiencies, tumor samples, and individuals without known rare genetic diseases. The correlation between NAGS, CPS1, and citrin mRNA expression in the individual glioblastoma, GBM, LUAD, and STAD samples was very weak. These results suggest that the increased cytoplasmic supply of either carbamylphosphate, produced by CPS1, or aspartate may be sufficient to promote tumorigenesis, as well as the need for an alternative explanation of CPS1 activity in the absence of NAGS expression and NAG.
