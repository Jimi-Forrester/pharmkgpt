39302365|t|Do Tau Deposition and Glucose Metabolism Dissociate in Alzheimer's Disease Trajectory?
39302365|a|Background: Tau aggregation demonstrates close associations with hypometabolism in Alzheimer's disease (AD), although differing pathophysiological processes may underlie their development. Objective: To establish whether tau deposition and glucose metabolism have different trajectories in AD progression and evaluate the utility of global measures of these pathological hallmarks in predicting cognitive deficits. Methods: 279 participants with amyloid-beta (Abeta) status, and T1-weighted MRI scans, were selected from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (http://adni.loni.usc.edu). We created the standard uptake value ratio images using Statistical Parametric Mapping 12 for [18F]AV1451-PET (tau) and [18F]FDG-PET (glucose metabolism) scans. Voxel-wise group and single-subject level SPM analysis evaluated the relationship between global [18F]FDG-PET and [18F]AV1451-PET depending on the Abeta status. Linear models assessed whether tau deposition or glucose metabolism better predicted clinical progression. Results: There was a dissociation between global cerebral glucose hypometabolism and global tau load in amyloid-positive AD and amyloid-negative mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (p >  0.05). Global hypometabolism was only associated with global cortical tau in amyloid-positive MCI. Voxel-level single subject tau load better predicted neuropsychological performance, Alzheimer's disease assessment scale-cognitive (ADAS-Cog) 13 score, and one-year change compared with regional and global hypometabolism. Conclusions: A dissociation between tau pathology and glucose metabolism at a global level in AD could imply that other pathological processes influence glucose metabolism. Furthermore, as tau is a better predictor of clinical progression, these processes may have independent trajectories and require independent consideration in the context of therapeutic interventions.
