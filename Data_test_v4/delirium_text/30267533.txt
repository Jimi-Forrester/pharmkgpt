30267533|a|BACKGROUND Relationships between serum prolactin concentrations and various CV risk factors in older adults have rarely been assessed. The aim of this study was to examine the relationships between serum prolactin concentrations and CV risk factors in older patients with multiple CV risk factors. MATERIAL AND METHODS This case-control study included 92 patients, 50-89 years old (median, 69 years), with multiple CV risk factors. We used data from general practice electronic health records and biochemical laboratory tests. Patients were divided according to categories of CV risk factors. RESULTS Serum prolactin concentrations were significantly higher in elderly people ($65 vs. >65) and in men (70.65+-58.02 vs. 150.82+-114.05 mIU/L), as well as in patients with lower renal function (156.70+-127.23 vs. 72.53+-37.25 mIU/L, the bottom vs. top quartile of creatinine clearance), higher serum homocysteine and TSH concentrations, and in those who used NSAID and statins. Parameters indicating chronic inflammation (CRP) and renal function decline (creatinine clearance) were significantly and independently correlated with increased serum prolactin concentrations in multiple regression analysis. CONCLUSIONS When assessing the relationships between prolactin and CV risk factors in older people with multiple CV risk factors, the effect of renal function decline and chronic inflammation should receive attention.
