38944103|a|Ozone pollution is increasingly recognized as a serious environmental threat that exacerbates dementia risks, including Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). Amid rapid industrialization, China faces significant air quality challenges. However, there has been a scarcity of detailed studies assessing the health and economic impacts of ozone pollution on these conditions. This study aims to address this gap by utilizing the BenMap-CE tool and incorporating parameters obtained from systematic reviews of epidemiological studies, official statistics, and weighted averages, to accurately quantify the effects of ozone exposure in China. This research evaluated the health and economic burdens at both national and provincial levels, focusing on the additional impacts attributed to increased ozone levels. The results reveal that in 2023, compared to 2015, ozone pollution contributed to approximately 110,000 new cases (5.6 per 10,000) of AD and 1.6 million new cases (81.7 per 10,000) of MCI, imposing significant economic costs of about US $1200 million for AD and US $18,000 million for MCI, based on 2015 dollar values. Additionally, our projections indicate that reducing the 2023 ozone concentrations to 70 mug/m3 could significantly curb these conditions, potentially preventing over 210,000 new AD cases (10.7 per 10,000) and 2.9 million (148.1 per 10,000) MCI cases. Such reductions are projected to yield substantial economic benefits, estimated at US $2200 million for AD and US $34,000 million for MCI (2015 dollar values). These findings underscore the profound implications of ozone pollution on public health and the economy in China, highlighting the urgent need for effective ozone management strategies to mitigate these impacts.
