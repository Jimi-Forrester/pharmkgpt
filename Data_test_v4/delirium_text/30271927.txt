30271927|a|The protein alpha-Synuclein (alphaS) is linked to Parkinson's disease through its abnormal aggregation, which is thought to involve cytosolic and membrane-bound forms of alphaS. Following previous studies using micelles and vesicles, we present a comprehensive study of alphaS interaction with phospholipid bilayer nanodiscs. Using a combination of NMR-spectroscopic, biophysical, and computational methods, we structurally and kinetically characterize alphaS interaction with different membrane discs in a quantitative and site-resolved way. We obtain global and residue-specific alphaS membrane affinities, and determine modulations of alphaS membrane binding due to alphaS acetylation, membrane plasticity, lipid charge density, and accessible membrane surface area, as well as the consequences of the different binding modes for alphaS amyloid fibril formation. Our results establish a structural and kinetic link between the observed dissimilar binding modes and either aggregation-inhibiting properties, largely unperturbed aggregation, or accelerated aggregation due to membrane-assisted fibril nucleation.
