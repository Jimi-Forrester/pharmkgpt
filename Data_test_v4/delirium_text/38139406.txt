38139406|t|Copper in Gynecological Diseases.
38139406|a|Copper (Cu) is an essential micronutrient for the correct development of eukaryotic organisms. This metal plays a key role in many cellular and physiological activities, including enzymatic activity, oxygen transport, and cell signaling. Although the redox activity of Cu is crucial for enzymatic reactions, this property also makes it potentially toxic when found at high levels. Due to this dual action of Cu, highly regulated mechanisms are necessary to prevent both the deficiency and the accumulation of this metal since its dyshomeostasis may favor the development of multiple diseases, such as Menkes' and Wilson's diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, diabetes mellitus, and cancer. As the relationship between Cu and cancer has been the most studied, we analyze how this metal can affect three fundamental processes for tumor progression: cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and metastasis. Gynecological diseases are characterized by high prevalence, morbidity, and mortality, depending on the case, and mainly include benign and malignant tumors. The cellular processes that promote their progression are affected by Cu, and the mechanisms that occur may be similar. We analyze the crosstalk between Cu deregulation and gynecological diseases, focusing on therapeutic strategies derived from this metal.
