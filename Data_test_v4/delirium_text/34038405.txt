34038405|t|Intraoperative cerebral oximetry in open heart surgeries reduced postoperative complications: A retrospective study.
34038405|a|Cardiothoracic surgeries are life-saving procedures but often it results in various complications. Intraoperative cerebral oximetry monitoring used to detect regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rScO2) is a non-invasive method that provides prognostic importance in cardiac surgery. The main aim of the present study was to evaluate the association of intraoperative cerebral oxygen monitoring during cardiac surgery on postoperative complications. This was a case-controlled retrospective study conducted on adult patients, who underwent open-heart surgery in National Heart Institute, Malaysia. The case group comprised patients on protocolized cerebral oximetry monitoring. They were treated using a standardized algorithm to maintain rScO2 not lower than 20% of baseline rScO2. The control group comprised patients with matched demographic background, preoperative risk factors, and type of surgical procedures. Propensity score stratification was utilized to contend with selection bias. Retrospective analysis was performed on 240 patients (case group) while comparing it to 407 patients (control group). The non-availability of cerebral oximetry monitoring during surgery was the prominent predictor for all outcome of complications; stroke (OR: 7.66), renal failure needing dialysis (OR: 5.12) and mortality (OR: 20.51). Postoperative complications revealed that there were significant differences for risk of mortality (p<0.001, OR = 20.51), renal failure that required dialysis (p<0.001, OR = 5.12) and stroke (p <0.05, OR = 7.66). Protocolized cerebral oximetry monitoring during cardiothoracic surgeries was found to be associated with lower incidence of stroke, renal failure requiring dialysis and mortality rate.
