32256561|t|Neuroprotection against Amyloid-beta-Induced DNA Double-Strand Breaks Is Mediated by Multiple Retinoic Acid-Dependent Pathways.
32256561|a|In this study, we have investigated the role of all-trans-retinoic acid (RA) as a neuroprotective agent against Abeta 1-42-induced DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in neuronal SH-SY5Y and astrocytic DI TNC1 cell lines and in murine brain tissues, by single-cell gel electrophoresis. We showed that RA does not only repair Abeta 1-42-induced DSBs, as already known, but also prevents their occurrence. This effect is independent of that of other antioxidants studied, such as vitamin C, and appears to be mediated, at least in part, by changes in expression, not of the RARalpha, but of the PPARbeta/delta and of antiamyloidogenic proteins, such as ADAM10, implying a decreased production of endogenous Abeta. Whereas Abeta 1-42 needs transcription and translation for DSB production, RA protects against Abeta 1-42-induced DSBs at the posttranslational level through both the RARalpha/beta/gamma and PPARbeta/delta receptors as demonstrated by using specific antagonists. Furthermore, it could be shown by a proximity ligation assay that the PPARbeta/delta-RXR interactions, not the RARalpha/beta/gamma-RXR interactions, increased in the cells when a 10 min RA treatment was followed by a 20 min Abeta 1-42 treatment. Thus, the PPARbeta/delta receptor, known for its antiapoptotic function, might for these short-time treatments play a role in neuroprotection via PPARbeta/delta-RXR heterodimerization and possibly expression of antiamyloidogenic genes. Overall, this study shows that RA can not only repair Abeta 1-42-induced DSBs but also prevent them via the RARalpha/beta/gamma and PPARbeta/delta receptors. It suggests that the RA-dependent pathways belong to an anti-DSB Adaptative Gene Expression (DSB-AGE) system that can be targeted by prevention strategies to preserve memory in Alzheimer's disease and aging.
