34831143|t|The Role of Glucocorticoids in Inflammatory Diseases.
34831143|a|For more than 70 years, glucocorticoids (GCs) have been a powerful and affordable treatment option for inflammatory diseases. However, their benefits do not come without a cost, since GCs also cause side effects. Therefore, strong efforts are being made to improve their therapeutic index. In this review, we illustrate the mechanisms and target cells of GCs in the pathogenesis and treatment of some of the most frequent inflammatory disorders affecting the central nervous system, the gastrointestinal tract, the lung, and the joints, as well as graft-versus-host disease, which often develops after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. In addition, an overview is provided of novel approaches aimed at improving GC therapy based on chemical modifications or GC delivery using nanoformulations. GCs remain a topic of highly active scientific research despite being one of the oldest class of drugs in medical use.
