32411571|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic and progressive neurological brain disorder. AD pathophysiology is mainly represented by formation of neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Neuritic plaques are made up of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides, which play a central role in AD pathogenesis. In AD brain, Abeta peptide accumulates due to overproduction, insufficient clearance and defective proteolytic degradation. The degradation and cleavage mechanism of Abeta peptides by several human enzymes have been discussed previously. In the mean time, numerous experimental and bioinformatics reports indicated the significance of microbial enzymes having potential to degrade Abeta peptides. Thus, there is a need to shift the focus toward the substrate specificity and structure-function relationship of Abeta peptide-degrading microbial enzymes. Hence, in this review, we discussed in vitro and in silico studies of microbial enzymes viz. cysteine protease and zinc metallopeptidases having ability to degrade Abeta peptides. In silico study showed that cysteine protease can cleave Abeta peptide between Lys16-Cys17; similarly, several other enzymes also showed capability to degrade Abeta peptide at different sites. Thus, this review paves the way to explore the role of microbial enzymes in Abeta peptide degradation and to design new lead compounds for AD treatment.
