34452275|t|Ectopic Odorant Receptor Responding to Flavor Compounds: Versatile Roles in Health and Disease.
34452275|a|Prompted by the ground-breaking discovery of the rodent odorant receptor (OR) gene family within the olfactory epithelium nearly 30 years ago, followed by that of OR genes in cells of the mammalian germ line, and potentiated by the identification of ORs throughout the body, our appreciation for ORs as general chemoreceptors responding to odorant compounds in the regulation of physiological or pathophysiological processes continues to expand. Ectopic ORs are now activated by a diversity of flavor compounds and are involved in diverse physiological phenomena varying from adipogenesis to myogenesis to hepatic lipid accumulation to serotonin secretion. In this review, we outline the key biological functions of the ectopic ORs responding to flavor compounds and the underlying molecular mechanisms. We also discuss research opportunities for utilizing ectopic ORs as therapeutic strategies in the treatment of human disease as well as challenges to be overcome in the future. The recognition of the potent function, signaling pathway, and pharmacology of ectopic ORs in diverse tissues and cell types, coupled with the fact that they belong to G protein-coupled receptors, a highly druggable protein family, unequivocally highlight the potential of ectopic ORs responding to flavor compounds, especially food-derived odorant compounds, as a promising therapeutic strategy for various diseases.
