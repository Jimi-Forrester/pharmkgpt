1233538|t|Clinical treatment of post partum delirium with perfenazine and lithium carbonate.
1233538|a|Despite the development of psychopharmaceutical therapy, post partum delirium was difficult to treat. The patients remained psychotic for long periods and the course was of the disease capricious due to the many relapses. A comparative study of two groups, one consisting of 6 patients and the other of 13, all with a typical post partum delirium was carried out. The symptomatic treatment of this syndrome with a combination of perfenazine and lithium carbonate produced relatively favorable results in our clinic. For the time being, at any rate, it seems to be the medication of choice.
