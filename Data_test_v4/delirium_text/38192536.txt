38192536|a|Background & Aims: The hospital frailty risk score (HFRS) identifies older patients at risk of poor outcomes and may have value in cirrhosis. We compared the Charlson (CCI), Elixhauser (ECI), and cirrhosis (CirCom) comorbidity indices with the HFRS in predicting outcomes for cirrhosis hospitalisations. Methods: Using the National Inpatient Sample (quarter 4 of 2015-2019), we analysed cirrhosis hospitalisations. For each index, we described the prevalence of comorbid conditions and inpatient mortality. We compared the ability of CCI, ECI, CirCom, and HFRS to predict inpatient mortality. Raw and adjusted models predicting inpatient mortality were compared using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and the Akaike information criterion. Results: The cohort's (N = 626,553) median age was 61 years (IQR 52-68 years), 60% were male, cirrhosis was caused by alcohol in 43%, and 38% had ascites. The median comorbidity scores are as follows: ECI 4 (IQR 3-6), CCI 5 (IQR 4-8), and HFRS 5.6 (IQR 3.0-8.6). The most common CirCom score was 0 + 0 (44%). Across the range of values of each index, we observed different mortality ranges: CCI 1.9-13.1%, ECI 3.2-8.7%, CirCom 4.9-13.8%, and HFRS 1.0-15.2%. An adjusted model with HFRS had the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve in predicting mortality (HFRS 0.782 vs. ECI 0.689, CCI 0.695, and CirCom 0.692). We observed substantial variation in mortality with HFRS within each level of CCI, ECI, and CirCom. For example, for ECI 4, mortality increased from 0.6 to 16.4%, as HFRS increased from 0 to 15. Conclusions: Comorbidity indices predict inpatient cirrhosis mortality, but HFRS performs better than CCI, ECI, and CirCom. HFRS is an ideal tool for measuring comorbidity burden and disease severity risk adjustment in cirrhosis-related administrative database studies. Impact and Implications: We compared commonly used comorbidity indices to a more recently described risk score (hospital frailty risk score [HFRS]) in patients with cirrhosis using a national sample of hospital records. Comorbid conditions are common in hospitalised patients with cirrhosis. There is significant variability in mortality across the range of each index. HFRS outperforms the Charlson comorbidity index, Elixhauser comorbidity index, and CirCom (cirrhosis-specific comorbidity scoring system) in predicting inpatient mortality. HFRS is a valuable index for risk adjustment in inpatient administrative database studies.
