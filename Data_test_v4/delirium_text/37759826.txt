37759826|t|Coupled Electrostatic and Hydrophobic Destabilisation of the Gelsolin-Actin Complex Enables Facile Detection of Ovarian Cancer Biomarker Lysophosphatidic Acid.
37759826|a|Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a promising biomarker candidate to screen for ovarian cancer (OC) and potentially stratify and treat patients according to disease stage. LPA is known to target the actin-binding protein gelsolin which is a key regulator of actin filament assembly. Previous studies have shown that the phosphate headgroup of LPA alone is inadequate to bind to the short chain of amino acids in gelsolin known as the PIP2-binding domain. Thus, the molecular-level detail of the mechanism of LPA binding is poorly understood. Here, we model LPA binding to the PIP2-binding domain of gelsolin in the gelsolin-actin complex through extensive ten-microsecond atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We predict that LPA binding causes a local conformational rearrangement due to LPA interactions with both gelsolin and actin residues. These conformational changes are a result of the amphipathic nature of LPA, where the anionic phosphate, polar glycerol and ester groups, and lipophilic aliphatic tail mediate LPA binding via charged electrostatic, hydrogen bonding, and van der Waals interactions. The negatively-charged LPA headgroup binds to the PIP2-binding domain of gelsolin-actin while its hydrophobic tail is inserted into actin, creating a strong LPA-insertion pocket that weakens the gelsolin-actin interface. The computed structure, dynamics, and energetics of the ternary gelsolin-LPA-actin complex confirms that a quantitative OC assay is possible based on LPA-triggered actin release from the gelsolin-actin complex.
