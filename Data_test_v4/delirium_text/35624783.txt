35624783|t|Chemical Composition, Antioxidant and Anti-Enzymatic Activity of Golden Root (Rhodiola rosea L.) Commercial Samples.
35624783|a|The aim of the study was to compare the chemical composition of the water and hydromethanolic extracts of R. rosea commercial samples in relation to their biological activity. For this purpose, the HPLC method was used for the determination of eleven phenolic compounds and AAS/AES was used for determination of five essential elements. Moreover, the contents of total phenolic, total flavonoid, total phenolic acids, and L(+)-ascorbic acid were determined. The antioxidant activity was assessed by DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) and ABTS radical scavenging activity, ferric-reducing/antioxidant power (FRAP), and cupric-reducing antioxidant capacity (CUPRAC) assays, while the inhibitory activity against AChE and BChE enzymes was determined using Ellman's method. The results showed that the hydromethanolic extracts of R. rosea were richer in phenolic compounds and showed higher antioxidant and neurobiological activity than the water extracts. However, the water extracts gave higher contents of determined elements. Among the individual phenolic compounds gallic acid (2.33 mg/g DW) and sinapic acid (386.44 microg/g DW) had the highest concentrations in the hydromethanolic and water extracts, respectively. Moreover, the most extracts were observed to be more efficient on BChE. Moreover, the correlation analysis indicated a high positive relationship between chemical composition and biological activity in both extracts of R. rosea.
