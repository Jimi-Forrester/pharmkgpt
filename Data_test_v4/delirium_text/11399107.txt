11399107|t|A biochemical theory to explain the cause of bovine spongiform encephalopathy and other encephalopathies.
11399107|a|The purpose of this study is to present a hypothesis to explain the aetiology of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) which is more credible than any at present available, and to increase its credibility by varying the hypothesis to supply explanations for Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and certain other conditions. The method used has been to utilize material from biochemical textbooks and similar sources. It has been concluded that BSE is caused by the failure to synthesize sufficient cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), with the result that neurons die because they are no longer able to prevent the entry of toxic quantities of calcium ions into their cytoplasm. Several causes for the failure to synthesize sufficient cGMP have been identified; these involve selenium and folate deficiencies, and problems with the availability of nicotinamide adenosine dinucleotide (NAD). It is proposed that BSE is initiated by a combination of selenium deficiency and the destruction of NAD by a bacterial toxin of the same type as causes cholera, that folate deficiency is the predominant cause of Alzheimer's disease, and that the failure to synthesize sufficient tetrahydrobiopterin and cGMP from guanosine triphosphate results in Parkinson's disease.
