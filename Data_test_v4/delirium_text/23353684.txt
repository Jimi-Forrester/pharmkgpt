23353684|t|Protease-activated alpha-2-macroglobulin can inhibit amyloid formation via two distinct mechanisms.
23353684|a|alpha(2)-Macroglobulin (alpha(2)M) is an extracellular chaperone that inhibits amorphous and fibrillar protein aggregation. The reaction of alpha(2)M with proteases results in an 'activated' conformation, where the proteases become covalently-linked within the interior of a cage-like structure formed by alpha(2)M. This study investigates, the effect of activation on the ability of alpha(2)M to inhibit amyloid formation by Abeta(1-42) and I59T human lysozyme and shows that protease-activated alpha(2)M can act via two distinct mechanisms: (i) by trapping proteases that remain able to degrade polypeptide chains and (ii) by a chaperone action that prevents misfolded clients from continuing along the amyloid forming pathway.
