38326524|a|The accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides is a crucial factor in the neuronal degeneration of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The current study investigated the underlying neuroprotective mechanisms of shrimp shell extract (SSE) and liposome-encapsulated SSE (SSE/L) against Abeta1-42-induced neuronal damage and death in rats. Intracerebroventricular infusion of Abeta1-42 effectively induced memory decline, as observed in a reduction of the rat's discriminating ability in the novel object recognition and novel object location tasks. Oral pretreatment with 100 mg/kg of SSE demonstrated no preventive effect on the memory decline induced by Abeta1-42 infusion. However, treatment with SSE/L 100 mg/kg BW effectively attenuated memory deficits in both behavioral assessments following two and four weeks after Abeta1-42 infusion. Moreover, SSE/L exerted neuroprotective effects by reducing lipid peroxidation and increasing Nrf2/HO-1 expression. There was a significant decrease in Iba1 and GFAP (biomarkers of microglia and astrocyte activity, respectively), as well as a decrease in the levels of NF-kappaB expression and the inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha and IL-6 in the cortical and hippocampal tissues. Treatment with SSE/L also reduced the pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and cleaved caspase-3 while raising the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl2. In addition, the beneficial effects of SSE/L were along with the effects of a positive control commercial astaxanthin (AST). The findings of this study indicated that SSE/L provided neuroprotective effects on Abeta1-42-induced AD rats by ameliorating oxidative stress, neuroinflammation and apoptotic cell death. Therefore, SSE/L might be employed to prevent and mitigate Abeta accumulation-induced neurotoxicity in AD.
