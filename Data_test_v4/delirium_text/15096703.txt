15096703|a|The protective role of antioxidants against the development of several diseases and conditions recognized as risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is discussed in the present work. A variety of health behaviors, including an adequate supply of antioxidant micronutrients with the diet might help preventing AD directly, or indirectly through the mitigation of pathologic conditions associated with AD, such as vascular disease and diabetes.
