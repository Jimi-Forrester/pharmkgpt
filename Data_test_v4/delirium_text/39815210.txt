39815210|t|Delirium at the intensive care unit and long-term survival: a retrospective study.
39815210|a|BACKGROUND: Delirium is a common complication in patients at the intensive care unit (ICU) and is associated with prolonged ICU-stay and hospitalization and with increased morbidity. The impact of ICU-delirium on long-term survival is not clearly understood. METHODS: This retrospective single center observational study was conducted at the Institute of Intensive Care Medicine at the University Hospital Zurich, Switzerland. All adult ICU-survivors over a four-year period were screened for eligibility. ICU-delirium was defined based on the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC), together with the coded diagnosis F05 in the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-2019). ICU-survivors who developed delirium during their ICU stay (group D) were compared with ICU-survivors who did not (group ND). Survival was evaluated according to data from hospital electronic health records up to four years from ICU-discharge. The survival analysis was reported using Kaplan-Meier curves and absolute risk differences (ARD). A multivariable logistic regression model was fitted with long-term survival at four years after ICU-discharge as outcome of interest, including several clinical conditions and interventions associated with long-term survival for ICU patients. For subgroup analysis, ICU-survivors were grouped based on age at the time of admission (45-54, 55-64, >= 65 years), and on relevant clinical conditions. RESULTS: A total of 9'604 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria, of them 22.6% (n = 2'171) developed ICU-delirium. Overall, patients in the group D had a significantly lower probability of survival than patients in the group ND (p < 0.0001, ARD = 11.8%). In the multivariable analysis, ICU-delirium was confirmed as independently associated with long-term survival. After grouping for age categories, patients between 55 and 64 years of age in the group D were less likely to survive than patients in the group ND at every time point analyzed, up to four years after ICU discharge (p < 0.001, ARD = 7.3%). This difference was even more significant in the comparison between patients over 65 years (p < 0.0001, ARD 11.1%). No significant difference was observed in the other age groups. CONCLUSIONS: In the study population, ICU-delirium was independently associated with a reduced long-term survival. Patients who developed ICU-delirium had a reduced survival up to four years after ICU discharge and this association was particularly evident in patients above 55 years of age.
