29541536|a|Objectives: The association of vascular risk factors (VRFs) with incidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VaD) has been well studied. However, the association between VRFs and non-AD dementia is seldom investigated. In this study, we aim to compare the concurrence of VRFs of Lewy body dementia (LBD) to AD. Materials & Methods: We consecutively enrolled patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD), and AD, and the prevalence of arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, hyperlipidemia, smoking, and obesity was assessed and compared. Results: A total of 167 consecutive patients were studied. Among them, 55 had DLB, 34 had PDD, and 78 had AD. History of any VRF among three groups was not significantly different. In addition, the patients with AD had significantly higher systolic pressure (SBP), diastolic pressure (DBP), waist, body mass index (BMI), ac glucose, and HbA1c (all p-value < .005). After a stepwise procedure that considered age, sex, disease severity, antiparkinson drugs, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, glycated hemoglobin, body mass index, triglyceride, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein, SBP in the third tertile (144-198 mmHg), BMI in the second tertile (23.6-26.4), and TG in the third tertile (127-310) were significantly lower in LBD than in AD. Conclusions: The VRFs are less associated with LBD than with AD. DLB and PDD showed a similar pattern of the association of VRFs. SBP, BMI, and TG were significantly lower in LBD compared with AD.
