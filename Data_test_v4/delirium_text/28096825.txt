28096825|a|INTRODUCTION: Patients with diabetes have a worse postoperative course and longer length of hospital stay after surgery. A good indicator of proper long-term (3 months) glycemic control is glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and fructosamine in the short term (2-3 weeks). AIM: To determine the degree of glycemic control evaluated preoperatively by HbA1c and/or fructosamine influence on the postoperative course of patients with diabetes undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in 2014-2015. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Before the operation HbA1c (N < 7.0) and fructosamine (N < 280 micromol/l) were measured and depending on the results the respondents were divided into 4 groups: group I (n = 46) - normal both parameters; group II (n = 22) - high both values; group III (n = 4) - normal fructosamine/HbA1c high; group IV (n = 33) - high HbA1c/fructosamine normal. Statistical analysis was performed using the t-test assuming p < 0.05 to be statistically significant. RESULTS: One hundred and five patients were treated by CABG/OPCAB (39 female, 66 males). The mean age was 65.7 +-7.3, HbA1c: 7.23 +-1.2%, fructosamine: 261.8 +-43.8. There was no difference in the incidence of other postoperative complications between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Glycated hemoglobin and fructosamine levels to a similar extent define the risk of perioperative complications in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. In patients in whom there is a need to quickly compensate for elevated blood glucose consider enabling determination of fructosamine.
