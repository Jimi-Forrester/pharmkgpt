18465518|a|KA-672 is a multifunctional antidementia agent under development by Schwabe as a potential agent to combat cognitive and other symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD), via modulation of the interplay between serotonergic, adrenergic, dopaminergic and cholinergic systems [260590]. It has also been categorized as a neuronal activator. Various studies support the notion that this compound could indeed have a broad range of nootropic properties. The compound is in phase II clinical trials [260592]. KA-672 selectively protects against NMDA-induced neurotoxicity but not against other chemoconvulsants or electroshock [260590]. At 0.3 mg/kg it inhibits the reduction in 5-HT brain levels following NMDA administration, and exacerbates the reduction in dopamine levels [260593]. It has been shown to bind to 5-HT1A, 5-HT7, a1, D2 and D3 receptors with nanomolar affinities, acting as an antagonist at a1 and D2 receptors [260592]. It also has nerve growth factor (NGF)-like activity [260591].
