36594054|a|Objectives: We investigated the harmful effects of high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) on learning and memory in the hippocampus and the ameliorative effects of melatonin (Mel). Materials and Methods: Thirty-six adult male Sprague Dawley rats were divided into three groups: Group I, control; Group II, HFCS; and Group III, HFCS+Mel. HFCS form F55 was prepared as a 20% fructose syrup solution. Rats in HFCS and HFCS+Mel groups were given drinking water for 10 weeks. Rats in the HFCS+Mel group have been given 10 mg/kg/day melatonin orally for the 6 weeks, in addition to HFCS 55. The Morris water maze (MWM) test was applied to all animals for 5 days to determine their learning and memory levels. After decapitation, one-half of the hippocampus samples were collected for western blot analysis, and another half of the tissues were collected for histopathological and immunohistochemical analyses. Results: In the HFCS group, there was a significant difference between the time to find the platform in the MWM test and time spent in the quadrant between days 1 and 5 (P=0.037 and P=0.001, respectively). In addition, a decreased level of MT1A receptor, TNF-alpha, iNOS, osteopontin (OPN), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) expressions were significantly increased in the HFCS group. Melatonin treatment reversed MT1A receptor levels and TNF-alpha, iNOS, OPN, and IL-6 expressions. During the histopathological examination, increased neuronal degenerations were observed in the HFCS group. Melatonin ameliorated these changes. Conclusion: Consumption of HFCS caused deterioration of learning and memory in adult rats. We suggest that melatonin is effective against learning and memory disorders.
