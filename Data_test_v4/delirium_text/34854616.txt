34854616|a|Polypharmacy may result in interactions and side effects that lead to morbidity and mortality. Therefore, it is important to evaluate on a regular basis the possibility to stop medication. Sometimes it is necessary to temporarily discontinue certain medication, for example when a patient is unable to swallow or suffers from a delirium. Not all drugs can be stopped abruptly, since this can result in a rebound-effect or withdrawal symptoms Especially drugs that act on the central nervous system (e.g. psychotropic drugs, dopaminergic drugs, opioids) are known to cause (severe) withdrawal symptoms when stopped abruptly In addition, beta-blockers, corticosteroids and proton-pump inhibitors cause symptoms when stopped without tapering. Gradually tapering off these medicines is needed, sometimes under guidance from a specialist. Moreover, it is important to realize that stopping medication can also introduce interactions.
