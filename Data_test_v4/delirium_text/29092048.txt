29092048|t|Intragenomic Conflict and Immune Tolerance: Do Selfish X-Linked Alleles Drive Skewed X Chromosome Inactivation?
29092048|a|In mammalian females, diploid somatic cells contain two X chromosomes, one of which is transcriptionally silenced, in a process termed X chromosome inactivation (XCI). Whereas XCI is largely random in placental females, many women exhibit skewed XCI (SXCI), in which the vast majority cells have the same X chromosome inactivated. SXCI has serious health consequences, associated with conditions ranging from Alzheimer's to various autoimmune disorders. SXCI is also associated with outcomes of pregnancies, with higher rates of recurrent spontaneous abortion in women with SXCI. Here, I suggest that SXCI could be driven by selfish X-linked alleles. Consistent with the association of SXCI with autoimmunity, I first note the possibility that recurrent spontaneous abortion could reflect immune rejection of fetuses inheriting alleles from the largely silenced maternal X chromosome. Preferential abortion of fetuses carrying silenced X-linked alleles implies a transmission advantage for X-linked alleles on the largely expressed chromosome, which could drive the emergence of X-linked alleles that make the chromosome resistant to XCI. I discuss the evolutionary dynamics, fitness tradeoffs and implications of this hypothesis, and suggest future directions.
