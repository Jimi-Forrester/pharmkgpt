1475329|t|Tailoring adult psychiatric practices to the field of geriatrics.
1475329|a|The United States' population is aging. Epidemiological surveys suggest significant rates of mental illness amongst the rapidly growing over-65 cohort. A burgeoning experience and data base related to the developing sub-discipline of geriatric psychiatry is now available. This article synthesizes key issues and concepts as an introduction to geropsychiatric practice-in particular, a) the interface between medical illness and psychiatric expression in the elderly, b) delirium, c) dementia, and d) depression-and considers their interactions. Finally, there is a brief overview of geriatric psychopharmacology, followed by clinically-oriented discussions of each of the major classes of psychotropics as applied to a geriatric population.
