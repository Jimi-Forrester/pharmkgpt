36502327|t|Fall Risk, Sleep Behavior, and Sleep-Related Movement Disorders in Young Urbanites Exposed to Air Pollution.
36502327|a|BACKGROUND: Quadruple aberrant hyperphosphorylated tau, amyloid-beta, alpha-synuclein, and TDP-43 pathology had been documented in 202/203 forensic autopsies in Metropolitan Mexico City <=40-year-olds with high exposures to ultrafine particulate matter and engineered nanoparticles. Cognition deficits, gait, equilibrium abnormalities, and MRI frontal, temporal, caudate, and cerebellar atrophy are documented in young adults. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify an association between falls, probable Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Behavior Disorder (pRBD), restless leg syndrome (RLS), and insomnia in 2,466 Mexican, college-educated volunteers (32.5+-12.4 years). METHODS: The anonymous, online study applied the pRBD and RLS Single-Questions and self-reported night-time sleep duration, excessive daytime sleepiness, insomnia, and falls. RESULTS: Fall risk was strongly associated with pRBD and RLS. Subjects who fell at least once in the last year have an OR = 1.8137 [1.5352, 2.1426] of answering yes to pRBD and/or RLS questions, documented in 29% and 24% of volunteers, respectively. Subjects fell mostly outdoors (12:01 pm to 6:00 pm), 43% complained of early wake up hours, and 35% complained of sleep onset insomnia (EOI). EOI individuals have an OR of 2.5971 [2.1408, 3.1506] of answering yes to the RLS question. CONCLUSION: There is a robust association between falls, pRBD, and RLS, strongly suggesting misfolded proteinopathies involving critical brainstem arousal and motor hubs might play a crucial role. Nanoparticles are likely a significant risk for falls, sleep disorders, insomnia, and neurodegenerative lethal diseases, thus characterizing air particulate pollutants' chemical composition, emission sources, and cumulative exposure concentrations are strongly recommended.
