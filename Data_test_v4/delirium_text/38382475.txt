38382475|t|The role of neurohospitalism in a specialized cardiovascular hospital.
38382475|a|INTRODUCTION: Cardiology and cardiothoracic surgery are among the specialties that most commonly require neurology inpatient consultations. We aimed to study the neurology referrals by the cardiovascular-specialized hospital included in our tertiary hospital center. METHODS: Retrospective study of consecutive patients referred for neurology inpatient consultation between 01/01/2020 and 31/12/2022. We analyzed referrals, patients' characteristics, and the approach taken. A detailed subanalysis was performed for patients diagnosed with acute ischemic stroke (AIS). RESULTS: 143 patients were observed [mean age 67.3 years, 46 (32.2%) females]. Most frequent referral reasons were suspected AIS deficits (39.2%), altered mental status (19.6%), suspected seizures (13.3%), and neuroprognostication (11.9%). Mean referral-to-consult time was 2.7 days, and 117 (81.8%) consults were in-person. Additional investigation, treatment changes, and outpatient clinic referral were proposed, respectively in 79.7%, 60.1%, and 19.6% of patients. Most common diagnoses were AIS (45.5%), hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (18.9%) and delirium (7.0%). Regarding patients with AIS (n=62), most common stroke causes were post-cardiac procedure (44.6%), infective endocarditis (18.5%), aortic dissection (10.8%), acute myocardial infarction (10.8%) and anticoagulant withdrawal in patients with atrial fibrillation (6.2%). 34 AIS patients were diagnosed less than 24-hours since last seen well, of which four (6.2%) were treated (three with thrombolysis and one with mechanical thrombectomy). CONCLUSION: AIS is the most common reason for referral in our cardiovascular hospital. Our results highlight the importance of the availability of a neurologist/neurohospitalist with stroke expertise for consultation of inpatients admitted in a specialized cardiovascular hospital.
