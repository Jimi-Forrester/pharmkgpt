10918348|t|The sensitivity to change over time of the Bristol Activities of Daily Living Scale in Alzheimer's disease.
10918348|a|Activities of daily living scales can be a useful tool in assessing change in people with dementia, either as the disease progresses or in response to treatment. However, little data exist as to the sensitivity to change of instruments used. The Bristol Activities of Daily Living Scale was developed with assistance from the carers of community dwelling people with dementia to be completed by such people and has been shown to have internal consistency as well as face and construct validity. This study aimed to analyse the sensitivity to change of the Bristol Activities of Daily Living Scale in people with Alzheimer's disease receiving anticholinesterase medication. Using the Clinician's Global Rating of Change as a gold standard for change, differences between Bristol Activities of Daily Living Scale scores before and after medication were compared with change in Mini-Mental State Examination, Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive and the Nurses Observation Scale for Geriatric Patients, in 61 older adults receiving anticholinesterase medication for Alzheimer's disease. Both the Bristol Activities of Daily Living Scale and the Nurses Observation Scale for Geriatric Patients are sensitive and specific in predicting improvement or stability as measured by the clinician's global rating of change. However, unlike the Nurses Observation Scale for Geriatric Patients, change over time in the Bristol Activities of Daily Living Scale significantly correlates with change in the Mini-Mental State Examination and the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive. The Bristol Activities of Daily Living Scale is sensitive to change in activities of daily living and shows the expected and desirable relationship with measures of cognition.
