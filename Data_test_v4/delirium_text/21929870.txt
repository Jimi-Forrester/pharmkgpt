21929870|a|Alzheimer disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease, which is characterized by loss of memory and cognitive function. In AD patients dysfunction of the cholinergic system is the main cause of cognitive disorders, and decreased activity of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT),  an enzyme responsible for acetylcholine (ACh) synthesis, is observed. In the present study we investigated if brain transplantation of human neural stem cells (NSCs) genetically modified to encode ChAT gene improves cognitive function of kainic acid (KA)-induced learning deficit rats. Intrahippocampal  injection of KA to hippocampal CA3 region caused severe neuronal loss, resulting in profound learning and memory deficit. F3.ChAT human NSCs transplanted intracerebroventricularly improved fully the learning and memory function of KA-induced learning deficit animals, in parallel with the elevation  of ACh levels in cerebrospinal fluid. F3.ChAT human NSCs migrated to the KA-induced injury site (CA3) and differentiated into neurons and astrocytes. The present study demonstrates that human NSCs expressing ChAT have lesion-tropic property and improve cognitive function of learning deficit  model rats with hippocampal injury by increasing ACh level.
