35641992|a|BACKGROUND: Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) is a phylogenetically conserved signaling pathway required for development that is aberrantly expressed in several age-related diseases including cancer, Alzheimer's disease, obesity, and cardiovascular disease. Aberrant BMP signaling in mice leads to obesity, suggesting it may alter normal metabolism. The role of BMP signaling regulating cancer metabolism is not known. METHODS: To examine BMP regulation of metabolism, C. elegans harboring BMP gain-of-function (gof) and loss-of-function (lof) mutations were examined for changes in activity of catabolic and anabolic metabolism utilizing Western blot analysis and fluorescent reporters. AMP activated kinase (AMPK) gof and lof mutants were used to examine AMPK regulation of BMP signaling. H1299 (LKB1 wild-type), A549 (LKB1 lof), and A549-LKB1 (LKB1 restored) lung cancer cell lines were used to study BMP regulation of catabolic and anabolic metabolism. Studies were done using recombinant BMP ligands to activate BMP signaling, and BMP receptor specific inhibitors and siRNA to inhibit signaling. RESULTS: BMP signaling in both C. elegans and cancer cells is responsive to nutrient conditions. In both C. elegans and lung cancer cell lines BMP suppressed AMPK, the master regulator of catabolism, while activating PI3K, a regulator of anabolism. In lung cancer cells, inhibition of BMP signaling by siRNA or small molecules increased AMPK activity, and this increase was mediated by activation of LKB1. BMP2 ligand suppressed AMPK activation during starvation. BMP2 ligand decreased expression of TCA cycle intermediates and non-essential amino acids in H1299 cells. Furthermore, we show that BMP activation of PI3K is mediated through BMP type II receptor. We also observed feedback signaling, as AMPK suppressed BMP signaling, whereas PI3K increased BMP signaling. CONCLUSION: These studies show that BMP signaling suppresses catabolic metabolism and stimulates anabolic metabolism. We identified feedback mechanisms where catabolic induced signaling mediated by AMPK negatively regulates BMP signaling, whereas anabolic signaling produces a positive feedback regulation of BMP signing through Akt. These mechanisms were conserved in both lung cancer cells and C. elegans. These studies suggest that aberrant BMP signaling causes dysregulation of metabolism that is a potential mechanism by which BMP promotes survival of cancer cells.
