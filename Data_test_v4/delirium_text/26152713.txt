26152713|t|Amyloid-beta peptide-induced cytotoxicity and mitochondrial dysfunction in yeast.
26152713|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease, characterized by deposits of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of neuron cell dysfunction and cell death in AD still remain poorly understood. Yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae shares many conserved biological processes with all eukaryotic cells, including human neurons. Thanks to relatively simple and quick genetic and environmental manipulations, the large knowledge base and data collections, this organism has become a valuable tool to unravel fundamental intracellular mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration. In this study, we have used yeast as a model system to study the effects of intracellular Abeta peptides and we found that cells constitutively producing native Abeta directed to the secretory pathway exhibited a lower growth rate, lower biomass yield, lower respiratory rate, increased oxidative stress, hallmarks of mitochondrial dysfunction and ubiquitin-proteasome system dysfunction. These findings are relevant for better understanding the role of Abeta in cell stress and cell damage.
