36994614|t|Our values and our historical understanding of psychiatrists.
36994614|a|Many people like to perceive themselves as better than previous generations: more knowledgeable, moral, tolerant and humane. Values associated with these aspects of ourselves may affect how we understand our professional forebears. In the early 20th century, some psychiatrists adopted new biomedical theories, including focal sepsis and eugenics, which resulted in inestimable harm. Detrimental clinical practices arose and were perpetuated in the context of societal values, medical ethics and other forces within and outside the medical profession. Historical understanding of the processes by which these things took place may help inform debate concerning current and future challenges of providing psychiatric care. The methods by which psychiatrists consider their predecessors may also have a bearing on how psychiatrists of the future will perceive us, the psychiatrists of the 2020s.
