8214183|a|The authors compared Alz-50 immunoreactivity in the brain tissue of nine cognitively impaired elderly schizophrenic patients and 13 elderly comparison subjects, both without neuritic plaques or neurofibrillary tangles, and 13 patients with Alzheimer's disease. Alz-50 reactivity was absent in the schizophrenic patients, indicating that geriatric, cognitively impaired patients are unlikely to display the pathology of Alzheimer's disease.
