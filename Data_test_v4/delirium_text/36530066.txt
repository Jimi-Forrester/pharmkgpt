36530066|a|Obesity and obesity-associated morbidity continues to be a major public health issue worldwide. Dementia is also a major health concern in aging societies and its prevalence has increased rapidly. Many epidemiologic studies have shown an association between obesity and cognitive impairment, but this relationship is not as well established as other comorbidities. Conflicting results related to the age and sex of participants, and the methodology used to define obesity and dementia may account for the uncertainty in whether obesity is a modifiable risk factor for dementia. More recently, sarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity have been reported to be associated with cognitive impairment. In addition, new mediators such as the muscle-myokine-brain axis and gut-microbiota-brain axis have been suggested and are attracting interest. In this review, we summarize recent evidence on the link between obesity and cognitive impairment, especially dementia. In particular, we focus on various metrics of obesity, from body mass index to sarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity.
