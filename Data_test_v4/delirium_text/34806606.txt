34806606|a|BACKGROUND: Hearing loss is independently associated with a faster rate of cognitive decline in older adults and has been identified as a modifiable risk factor for dementia. The mechanism for this association is unknown, and there has been limited exploration of potential casual pathology. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to investigate whether there was an association between degree of audiometrically measured hearing loss (HL) and brain amyloid-beta (Abeta) in a pre-clinical sample. METHODS: Participants of the Australian Imaging and Biomarker Longitudinal Study (AIBL; n = 143) underwent positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and objective measurement of hearing thresholds within 5 years of imaging, as well as cognitive assessment within 2 years of imaging in this observational cohort study. RESULTS: With one exception, study participants who had cognitive assessments within 2 years of their PET imaging (n = 113) were classified as having normal cognition. There was no association between cognitive scores and degree of hearing loss, or between cognitive scores and Abeta load. No association between HL and Abeta load was found once age was controlled for. As previously reported, positive Apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) carrier status increased the risk of being Abeta positive (p = 0.002). CONCLUSION: Degree of HL was not associated with positive Abeta status.
