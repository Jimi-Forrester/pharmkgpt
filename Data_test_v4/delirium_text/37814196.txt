37814196|t|Intricate relationship between obstructive sleep apnea and dementia in older adults.
37814196|a|Numerous evidence reports direct correlation between cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease and sleep disorders, in particular obstructive sleep apnea. Both obstructive sleep apnea and Alzheimer's disease are highly prevalent conditions whose incidence increases with age. Several studies demonstrate how sleep-disordered breathing may lead to poor cognition, even though the underlying mechanisms of this association remain partially unclear. According to the most recent studies, obstructive sleep apnea may be considered a modifiable risk factor for cognitive dysfunction. In the present review, the authors aim to integrate recent research examining obstructive sleep apnea and Alzheimer's disease biomarkers, also focusing on the mechanisms that support this correlation, including but not limited to the role of hypoxia and cardiovascular risk. Moreover, the potential favourable effect of obstructive sleep apnea therapy on cognitive function is discussed, to evaluate the benefits deriving from appropriate treatment of sleep-disordered breathing on cognition.
