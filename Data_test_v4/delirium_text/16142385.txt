16142385|t|cDNA microarray-based analysis of differentially expressed genes in transgenic brains expressing NSE-controlled APPsw.
16142385|a|cDNA microarray technique has been widely used for the detection and elucidation of differentially expressed genes on a large scale and at a speed never before possible. The aim of this study was to gain insight into the potentially overexpressed effects of APPsw on the modulation of genes for Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is central to understanding the complexity of AD. APPsw transgenic mice, which we previously produced, provide an important resource for identifying differentially expressed genes since this transgenic line was shown to have cognitive deficits along with Abeta-42 deposits at 12 months of age. To identify differentially expressed genes, cDNA microarray technique was conducted to get a large-scale screening of brain mRNA from 18 month-old NSE/APPsw transgenic and non-transgenic mice. A total of 52 differentially expressed genes, 10 up-regulated and 42 down-regulated, were found in the brains of moderately transgenic mice compared to non-transgenic littermates. Thus, the results suggest the need for future studies on gene functions, pathology, toxicogenomics, and pharmacogenomics.
