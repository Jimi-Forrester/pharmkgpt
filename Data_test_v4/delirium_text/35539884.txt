35539884|a|Tau protein, the major player in Alzheimer's disease forms neurofibrillary tangles in elderly people. Bramhi (Baccopa Monniera) is often used as an ayurvedic treatment for Alzheimer's disease. Therefore it is of interest to study the interaction of compounds derived from Baccopa with the Tau protein involved in tangle formation. We show that compounds such as bacopaside II, bacopaside XII, and nicotine showed optimal binding features with the R2 repeat domain of hyperphosphorylated tau protein for further consideration in the context of Alzheimer's disease (AD).
