37814304|t|Distribution and influencing factors on residual pockets of the teeth in patients with periodontitis following non-surgical periodontal treatment: a retrospective observational study.
37814304|a|BACKGROUND: Periodontitis is a chronic and multi-factorial infectious disease. A notable difference exists in the prognosis of patients with severe periodontitis after non-surgical periodontal treatment. Thus, a retrospective study was conducted to identify common and specific factors that impact the prognosis of patients with periodontitis stage III-IV following non-surgical periodontal treatment at different tooth sites. METHODS: A total of 977 teeth were included in the study, comprising 266 patients diagnosed with periodontitis stage III-IV. This sample included 330 anterior teeth, 362 maxillary posterior teeth, and 285 mandibular posterior teeth. Following treatment, the teeth were categorized into two groups based on residual pocket depth [probing depth (PD) >= 5 mm] at 3 months post-treatment. The prognosis of periodontitis stage III-IV was assessed through multivariate analysis employing logistic regression to determine the association of various risk factors. RESULTS: The PD values of each site and the deepest PD values of each tooth significantly decreased at 3 months post-treatment. Residual pockets were predominantly found in the mesio/disto-buccal and mesio/disto-lingual regions. Multivariate analysis revealed that gender, PD, sulcus bleeding index (SBI) and plaque index (PLI) at baseline, and crown-root ratio in anterior teeth had a significant influence on periodontitis stage III-IV (P < 0.05). Smoking, PD, PLI and furcation involvement (FI) at baseline, PLI at 3 months post-treatment, grades of periodontitis, and crown-root ratio were prediction factors for maxillary posterior teeth. Factors such as PD, PLI and FI at baseline, PLI at 3 months post-treatment, and crown-root were significant in mandibular posterior teeth. CONCLUSIONS: The outcome of non-surgical treatment varies depending on the tooth positions for patients with periodontitis stage III-IV. Dentists must accurately identify the affected teeth that have periodontal pockets of more than 5 mm, taking into consideration the positions of the affected teeth, as well as various local and systemic factors. This comprehensive assessment will enable dentists to develop a customized and effective treatment plan.
