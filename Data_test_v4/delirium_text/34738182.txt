34738182|t|Psychotropic drug use among older people with major neurocognitive disorder: a cross-sectional study based on Swedish national registries.
34738182|a|AIM: Psychotropic medications include many drugs that may be inappropriate for older individuals with cognitive impairment. In Sweden, many people become registered in the Swedish Dementia Registry when they are diagnosed with major neurocognitive disorder (NCD). In this study, we aim to describe psychotropic drug use and associated factors among older Swedish people with major NCD. METHODS: This study included 38,251 people >= 65 years from the Swedish registry for cognitive/dementia disorders diagnosed during 2007-2017. Drug use was defined as one or more filled prescription(s) recorded in the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register during 1 July to 31 December 2017. Associations between psychotropics and age, sex, diagnosis date, Mini-Mental State Examination score and major NCD subtype were analysed through multiple logistic regression. RESULTS: We found that 12.0% of the individuals filled at least one prescription for antipsychotics, 22.0% for anxiolytics, 23.0% for sedatives or hypnotics, 43.2% for antidepressants and 56.7% for antidementia drugs. In brief, psychotropic use was associated with female sex, higher age, longer time since diagnosis and specific subtypes of major NCD; the strongest association was found between antipsychotics and Lewy body dementia (odds ratio 2.40, 95% confidence interval 2.04-2.82). CONCLUSION: Psychotropic drugs were frequently dispensed among older Swedish people with major NCD. The use of antipsychotics and medications with sedative properties warrants concern, especially among those with Lewy body dementia who are severely sensitive to antipsychotics. A more restrictive prescribing pattern regarding these medications might reduce the risk of drug-related problems in this vulnerable group of people.
