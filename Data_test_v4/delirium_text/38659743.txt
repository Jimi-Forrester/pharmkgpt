38659743|t|Bridging the Gap: Multi-Omics Profiling of Brain Tissue in Alzheimer's Disease and Older Controls in Multi-Ethnic Populations.
38659743|a|INTRODUCTION: Multi-omics studies in Alzheimer's disease (AD) revealed many potential disease pathways and therapeutic targets. Despite their promise of precision medicine, these studies lacked African Americans (AA) and Latin Americans (LA), who are disproportionately affected by AD. METHODS: To bridge this gap, Accelerating Medicines Partnership in AD (AMP-AD) expanded brain multi-omics profiling to multi-ethnic donors. RESULTS: We generated multi-omics data and curated and harmonized phenotypic data from AA (n=306), LA (n=326), or AA and LA (n=4) brain donors plus Non-Hispanic White (n=252) and other (n=20) ethnic groups, to establish a foundational dataset enriched for AA and LA participants. This study describes the data available to the research community, including transcriptome from three brain regions, whole genome sequence, and proteome measures. DISCUSSION: Inclusion of traditionally underrepresented groups in multi-omics studies is essential to discover the full spectrum of precision medicine targets that will be pertinent to all populations affected with AD.
