22351073|a|Generation of amyloid peptide (Abeta) is at the beginning of a cascade that leads to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Amyloid precursor protein (APP), as well as beta- and gamma-secretases, is the principal player involved in Abeta production, while alpha-secretase cleavage on APP prevents Abeta deposition. Recent studies suggested that soluble assembly states of Abeta peptides can cause cognitive problems by disrupting synaptic function in the absence of significant neurodegeneration. Therefore, current research investigates the relative importance of these various soluble Abeta assemblies in causing synaptic dysfunction and cognitive deficits. Several Abeta oligomers targets and cellular mechanisms responsible of Abeta-induced synaptic failure have been identified. The first and most important mechanism impugns a toxic gain of function for Abeta which results due to self-association and attainment of new structures capable of novel interactions that lead to impaired plasticity. Other scenarios predicate that Abeta has a normal physiological role. On the one hand, insufficient Abeta could lead to a loss of normal function, whereas excess Abeta may precipitate dysfunction. How this occurs and which the main target/s is/are for the synaptic action of Abeta remains to be fully understood and would certainly represent one of the main challenges to future AD research.
