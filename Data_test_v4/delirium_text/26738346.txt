26738346|t|Forensic medicine evaluation of Alzheimer patients: a series from Ankara, Turkey.
26738346|a|BACKGROUND/AIM: Pathophysiological changes due to Alzheimer disease and increasing age might result in situations requiring forensic evaluation in the elderly. Judicial bodies might need forensic evaluation of trauma and the decision-making capacity of Alzheimer patients. This study aimed to determine the demographic and clinical characteristics of Alzheimer patients seen for forensic evaluation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forensic records issued by the Department of Forensic Medicine of Hacettepe University in 2012 and 2013 were investigated. Patients with Alzheimer disease were included in the study and were analyzed in terms of age, sex, reason for application, comorbid medical conditions, occupation, and place and status of living. RESULTS: There were 30 Alzheimer patients examined in the study period. Of these, 17 (56.6%) were male and 13 (43.3%) were female. The patients' ages ranged between 51 and 90 years, and the mean age was 78.7 years. The majority of cases (25, 83.3%) were transferred for evaluation of decision-making capacity, while only 5 (17.7%) were referred to our department for forensic reporting of bodily damage. CONCLUSION: Forensic reporting of bodily damage in Alzheimer patients is similar to common injury cases. However, in conditions requiring evaluation of decision-making capacity in Alzheimer patients, all records should be carefully examined and a complete neuropsychiatric evaluation should be performed.
