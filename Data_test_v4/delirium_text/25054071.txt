25054071|t|Management of Gamma-Butyrolactone Dependence with Assisted Self-Administration of GBL.
25054071|a|Gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) and its liquid precursor gamma-butyrolactone (GBL) have become increasingly popular beyond the clubbing culture resulting in daily consumption and dependence in the broader population. This case report illustrates the challenges of managing GHB-withdrawal and a possibly superior future approach of its management by titration and tapering of the addictive agent.
