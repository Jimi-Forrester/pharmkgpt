38943191|t|Cognitive training and promoting a healthy lifestyle for individuals with isolated REM sleep behavior disorder: study protocol of the delayed-start randomized controlled trial CogTrAiL-RBD.
38943191|a|BACKGROUND: Isolated REM sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) is an early alpha-synucleinopathy often accompanied by incipient cognitive impairment. As executive dysfunctions predict earlier phenotypic conversion from iRBD to Parkinson's disease and Lewy body dementia, cognitive training focusing on executive functions could have disease-modifying effects for individuals with iRBD. METHODS: The study CogTrAiL-RBD investigates the short- and long-term effectiveness and the feasibility and underlying neural mechanisms of a cognitive training intervention for individuals with iRBD. The intervention consists of a 5-week digital cognitive training accompanied by a module promoting a healthy, active lifestyle. In this monocentric, single-blinded, delayed-start randomized controlled trial, the intervention's effectiveness will be evaluated compared to an initially passive control group that receives the intervention in the second, open-label phase of the study. Eighty individuals with iRBD confirmed by polysomnography will be consecutively recruited from the continuously expanding iRBD cohort at the University Hospital Cologne. The evaluation will focus on cognition and additional neuropsychological and motor variables. Furthermore, the study will examine the feasibility of the intervention, effects on physical activity assessed by accelerometry, and interrogate the intervention's neural effects using magnetic resonance imaging and polysomnography. Besides, a healthy, age-matched control group (HC) will be examined at the first assessment time point, enabling a cross-sectional comparison between individuals with iRBD and HC. DISCUSSION: This study will provide insights into whether cognitive training and psychoeducation on a healthy, active lifestyle have short- and long-term (neuro-)protective effects for individuals with iRBD. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was prospectively registered in the German Clinical Trial Register (DRKS00024898) on 2022-03-11, https://drks.de/search/de/trial/DRKS00024898 .
