24352184|a|PURPOSE: Recent impactful additions to the professional literature on the role of pharmacotherapy in treating the critically ill are summarized. SUMMARY: An unusually large number of updated practice guidelines and other publications with broad critical care pharmacotherapy ramifications appeared in the primary biomedical literature during the designated review period (February 2012-February 2013). Hundreds of relevant articles were evaluated by the Critical Care Pharmacotherapy Literature Update group (CCPLU), a national group of pharmacists who routinely monitor 25 peer-reviewed journals for emerging evidence that pertains to rational medication use in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting. From among those articles, 64 were summarized for dissemination to CCPLU members; the 8 publications deemed to have the greatest utility for critical care practitioners, as determined by CCPLU through a voting process, were selected for inclusion in this review, with preference given to evidence meeting high standards of methodological quality. The summaries presented here include (1) important new recommendations on management of pain, agitation, and delirium in critically ill patients, (2) a comprehensive update of a practice guideline issued in 2008 by the Surviving Sepsis Campaign, (3) novel strategies for the prevention and/or treatment of hyperglycemia in critical care, and (4) reports on clinical trials of promising alternative methods of sedation for use in weaning patients from mechanical ventilation. CONCLUSION: This review provides synopses of practice guidelines and other recent additions to the professional literature pertaining to rational medication use in the ICU practice setting.
