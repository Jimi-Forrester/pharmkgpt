20860877|a|The neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays a critical role in neuronal survival, synaptic plasticity, and memory. Several recent studies have demonstrated altered BDNF serum levels in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. However, the association of BDNF serum levels with the rate of cognitive decline in AD patients is still unclear. We demonstrate that BDNF serum levels are significantly decreased in AD patients with fast cognitive decline [decrease of Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score >4/yr; n=12] compared to AD patients with slow cognitive decline (decrease of MMSE score <=4/yr, n=28) and show a significant correlation with the rate of cognitive decline during 1 yr follow-up. These results suggest that higher BDNF serum levels are associated with a slower rate of cognitive decline in AD patients. Further longitudinal studies are necessary to elucidate the kinetics and the potential role of serum BDNF as a surrogate marker of disease progression in AD patients.
