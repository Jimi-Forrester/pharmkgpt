36361511|t|Quantitative Metabolomic Analysis of Changes in the Rat Blood Serum during Autophagy Modulation: A Focus on Accelerated Senescence.
36361511|a|Autophagy is involved in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis and the removal of damaged proteins and organelles and is necessary to maintain cell metabolism in conditions of energy and nutrient deficiency. A decrease in autophagic activity plays an important role in age-related diseases. However, the metabolic response to autophagy modulation remains poorly understood. Here, we for the first time explored the effects of (1) autophagy activation by 48 h fasting, (2) inhibition by chloroquine (CQ) treatment, and (3) combined effects of fasting and CQ on the quantitative composition of metabolites in the blood serum of senescent-accelerated OXYS and control Wistar rats at the age of 4 months. By means of high-resolution 1H NMR spectroscopy, we identified the quantitative content of 55 serum metabolites, including amino acids, organic acids, antioxidants, osmolytes, glycosides, purine, and pyrimidine derivatives. Groups of 48 h fasting (induction of autophagy), CQ treatment (inhibition of autophagy), and combined effects (CQ + fasting) are clearly separated from control groups by principal component analysis. Fasting for 48 h led to significant changes in the serum metabolomic profile, primarily affecting metabolic pathways related to fatty acid metabolism, and led to metabolism of several amino acids. Under CQ treatment, the most affected metabolites were citrate, betaine, cytidine, proline, tryptophan, glutamate, and mannose. As shown by two-way ANOVA, for many metabolites the effects of autophagy modulation depend on the animal genotype, indicating a dysregulation of metabolome reactivity in OXYS rats. Thus, the metabolic responses to modulation of autophagy in OXYS rats and Wistar rats are different. Altered metabolites in OXYS rats may serve as potential biomarkers of the manifestation of the signs of accelerated aging. Metabolic signatures characteristic to fasting and CQ treatment revealed in this work might provide a better understanding of the connections between metabolism and autophagy.
