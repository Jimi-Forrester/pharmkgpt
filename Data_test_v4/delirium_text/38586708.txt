38586708|t|Targeted Temperature Management for Traumatic Asphyxia: A Case Report.
38586708|a|Traumatic asphyxia (TA) is a rare condition due to severe crush injury to the upper abdomen or chest region. Elevated intrathoracic pressure causes impaired venous return, which damages the small vessels. Consciousness is reportedly lost in many TA cases. In the most severe cases, hypoxic encephalopathy occurs. Since TA patients usually have other traumatic complications such as thoracic or abdominal injury, the mortality rate of this syndrome is quite variable. Hypothermia is a risk factor for mortality in trauma patients, and targeted temperature management (TTM) is rarely performed for trauma cases. There are scattered articles reporting the usefulness of TTM in severe traumatic brain injury. To our best knowledge, there have been no reports of TTM in TA cases. We herein report a TA case with decorticate rigidity having a good neurological outcome after TTM.
