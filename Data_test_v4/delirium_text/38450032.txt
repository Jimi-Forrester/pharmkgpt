38450032|a|Aim: Femoral fractures are one of the most debilitating injuries presenting to the emergency departments (EDs). The pain caused by these fractures is typically managed with opioids and adjunctive regional analgesia. These approaches are often associated with adverse side effects. Thus, appropriate alternative methods should be thoroughly investigated. To evaluate ultrasound-guided femoral nerve block (FNB) with ultrasound-guided fascia iliaca compartment block (FICB) in femoral fractures, to determine which provides better analgesia and less opioid requirement. Methods: This study was a randomized clinical trial performed on adult patients presenting to the ED within 3 h of isolated femoral fracture with initial numerical pain rating scale (NRS-0) score of more than 5. The patients were randomized to receive FNB or FICB. The outcomes were block success rates, pain at 20 (NRS-20) and 60 (NRS-60) min after the end of the procedures, as well as the number and total dose of fentanyl administration during ED stay. Results: Eighty-seven patients were recruited (40 FNB and 47 FICB). Success rates were 82.5% in FNB and 83.0% in FICB group, with no significant difference between the groups. NRS-20, NRS-60, the number of patients who received supplemental fentanyl, and the total dose of administered fentanyl were significantly lower following FNB. However, the length of the procedure was significantly lower in the FICB group. Conclusion: Both FNB and FICB are effective in pain reduction for fractures of femur, but FNB provides more pain relief and less need for supplemental fentanyl.
