28634349|a|Recent studies have demonstrated that hyperphosphorylation of tau protein plays a role in neuronal toxicities of alpha-synuclein (ASYN) in neurodegenerative disease such as familial Alzheimer's disease (AD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's disease. Using a transgenic mouse model of Parkinson's disease (PD) that expresses GFP-ASYN driven by the PDGF-beta promoter, we investigated how accumulation of ASYN impacted axonal function. We found that retrograde axonal trafficking of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in DIV7 cultures of E18 cortical neurons was markedly impaired at the embryonic stage, even though hyperphosphorylation of tau was not detectable in these neurons at this stage. Interestingly, we found that overexpressed ASYN interacted with dynein and induced a significant increase in the activated levels of small Rab GTPases such as Rab5 and Rab7, both key regulators of endocytic processes. Furthermore, expression of ASYN resulted in neuronal atrophy in DIV7 cortical cultures of either from E18 transgenic mouse model or from rat E18 embryos that were transiently transfected with ASYN-GFP for 72 hrs. Our studies suggest that excessive ASYN likely alters endocytic pathways leading to axonal dysfunction in embryonic cortical neurons in PD mouse models.
