35078603|t|Noninvasive brain stimulation to augment language therapy for primary progressive aphasia.
35078603|a|Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is a debilitating disorder characterized by the gradual loss of language functioning resulting from neurodegenerative diseases including frontotemporal lobar degeneration or Alzheimer's disease pathology. There is a dearth of research investigating language therapy in PPA. Unlike individuals with poststroke aphasia, language skills are expected to decline over time, so the goal of treatment is often to preserve existing language functioning. There has been an increasing interest in using non-invasive brain stimulation including transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to augment traditional behavioral therapy in PPA. Research is promising and suggests neuromodulation can lead to generalization and maintenance of treatment effects for a longer period compared to behavioral therapy alone. Emerging research is also beginning to identify predictors of treatment response. Yet there is still much to learn regarding how neuromodulation factors (e.g., type of stimulation, stimulation intensity), participant factors (e.g., demographics, extent and location of atrophy), and treatment factors (e.g., type of language therapy, and dosage) will interact to predict treatment response. We are moving toward a promising future where individuals with PPA will benefit from individualized therapy protocols pairing traditional language therapy with neuromodulation.
