37014126|t|Glycosphingolipids within membrane contact sites influence their function as signaling hubs in neurodegenerative diseases.
37014126|a|Intracellular organelles carry out many of their functions by engaging in extensive inter-organellar communication through specialized membrane contact sites (MCSs) formed where two organelles tether to each other or to the plasma membrane without fusing. In recent years, these ubiquitous membrane structures have emerged as central signaling hubs that control a multitude of cellular pathways, ranging from lipid metabolism/transport to the exchange of metabolites and ions (i.e. Ca2+ ), and general organellar biogenesis. The functional crosstalk between juxtaposed membranes at MCSs relies on a defined composite of proteins and lipids that populate these microdomains in a dynamic fashion. This is particularly important in the nervous system, where alterations in the composition of MCSs have been shown to affect their functions and have been implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we focus on the MCSs that are formed by the tethering of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the mitochondria, the ER to the endo-lysosomes and the mitochondria to the lysosomes. We highlight how glycosphingolipids that are aberrantly processed/degraded and accumulate ectopically in intracellular membranes and the plasma membrane change the topology of MCSs, disrupting signaling pathways that lead to neuronal demise and neurodegeneration. In particular, we focus on neurodegenerative lysosomal storage diseases linked to altered glycosphingolipid catabolism.
