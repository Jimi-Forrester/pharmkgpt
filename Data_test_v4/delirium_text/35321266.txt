35321266|t|Acute amnesia caused by left fornix infarction: A case report of an unusual entity.
35321266|a|Cerebral infarction is an uncommon and unusual cause of acute amnesia. The fornix is a white matter tract bundle that plays an important function in memory. We present the case of a 60-year-old male presenting with altered mental status and acute onset amnesia with CT and MR imaging demonstrating an acute left fornix infarct. This case serves to further illuminate the findings associated with this uncommon clinical event. In addition, it highlights the importance for physicians across multiple subspecialities to maintain an index of suspicion for fornix infarct in the evaluation of acute onset amnesia.
