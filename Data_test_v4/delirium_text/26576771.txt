26576771|t|Combined Genome-Wide CSF Abeta-42's Associations and Simple Network Properties Highlight New Risk Factors for Alzheimer's Disease.
26576771|a|The abnormal deposition of amyloid-beta protein in the brain plays an important role in Alzheimer's disease (AD), being considered a potential clinical biomarker. To investigate genetic associations with amyloid-beta we used biomarker data and genome-wide variants from individuals with AD and mild cognitive impairment in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. We used a standard linear model and retested the associations with a mixed linear model to correct the residual sample structure. Both methods' results showed two identical significant SNPs associated with the A beta-42 levels in CSF (rs2075650 at intron region TOMM40 with p-value >= 1 x 10-16 and rs439401 in the intergenic region of LOC100129500 and APOC1 with p-value >= 1 x 10-9) and highlighted APOC1 and TOMM40, which are well-known genes previously associated with AD. Extending our analysis, we considered possible candidate genes mapped to SNPs with p-value >= 1 x 10-6 to explore gene-set enrichment e gene-gene network analysis, which reveals genes related to synaptic transmission, transmission of nerve impulses, cell-cell signaling and neurological processes. These genes require fine mapping and replication studies to allow more detailed understanding of how they may contribute to the genetic architecture of AD.
