34753466|t|A parsimonious model to validate cost-effectiveness analyses on preventive health care.
34753466|a|BACKGROUND: The effect of preventive health care on health expenditures is ambiguous. On the one hand, prevention reduces the costs of future morbidity. On the other hand, prevention leads to costs of life extension. The purpose of this paper is to develop a parsimonious model that determines for a preventive measure of interest whether savings from preventing morbidity are more than offset by the costs of living longer, resulting in a net expenditure increase. METHODS: A theoretical model was built based on a Weibull survival function. It includes savings and life extension costs over the remaining lifetime. The model was applied to the example of obesity prevention. RESULTS: The model shows that the cost consequences of prevention are essentially driven by two factors: i) the relative reduction of morbidity-related costs, which determines the amount of savings from avoiding morbidity; and ii) the hazard ratio of death, which determines the amount of life extension costs. In the application example, the model is able to validate the results of a more complex cost-effectiveness model on obesity prevention. CONCLUSIONS: This work provides new insight into the lifetime cost consequences of prevention. The model can be used both to check plausibility of the results of other models and to conduct an independent analysis.
