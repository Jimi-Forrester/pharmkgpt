35196956|a|Multifunctional molecules might offer better treatment of complex multifactorial neurological diseases. Monoaminergic pathways dysregulation and neuroinflammation are common convergence points in diverse neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders. Aiming to target these diseases, polypharmacological agents modulating both monoaminergic pathways and neuroinflammatory were addressed. A library of analogues of the natural product hispidol was prepared and evaluated for inhibition of monoamine oxidases (MAOs) isoforms. Several molecules emerged as selective potential MAO B inhibitors. The most promising compounds were further evaluated in vitro for their impact on microglia viability, induced production of proinflammatory mediators and MAO-B inhibition mechanism. Amongst tested compounds, 1p was a safe potent competitive reversible MAO-B inhibitor and inhibitor of microglial production of neuroinflammatory mediators; NO and PGE2. In-silico study provided insights into molecular basis of the observed selective MAO B inhibition. This study presents compound 1p as a promising lead compound for management of neurodegenerative disease.
