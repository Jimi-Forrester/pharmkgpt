36756614|t|Microglia: The breakthrough to treat neovascularization and repair blood-retinal barrier in retinopathy.
36756614|a|Microglia are the primary resident retinal macrophages that monitor neuronal activity in real-time and facilitate angiogenesis during retinal development. In certain retinal diseases, the activated microglia promote retinal angiogenesis in hypoxia stress through neurovascular coupling and guide neovascularization to avascular areas (e.g., the outer nuclear layer and macula lutea). Furthermore, continuously activated microglia secrete inflammatory factors and expedite the loss of the blood-retinal barrier which causes irreversible damage to the secondary death of neurons. In this review, we support microglia can be a potential cellular therapeutic target in retinopathy. We briefly describe the relevance of microglia to the retinal vasculature and blood-retinal barrier. Then we discuss the signaling pathway related to how microglia move to their destinations and regulate vascular regeneration. We summarize the properties of microglia in different retinal disease models and propose that reducing the number of pro-inflammatory microglial death and conversing microglial phenotypes from pro-inflammatory to anti-inflammatory are feasible for treating retinal neovascularization and the damaged blood-retinal barrier (BRB). Finally, we suppose that the unique properties of microglia may aid in the vascularization of retinal organoids.
