36068999|a|OBJECTIVES: Caregivers of individuals with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias experience significant burden and adverse outcomes. Enhancing caregiver self-efficacy has the potential to mitigate these negative impacts, yet little is known about its relationship with other aspects of caregiving. This study examined the relationship between self-efficacy and outcomes; identified factors associated with self-efficacy; examined the mediating role of self-efficacy; and analyzed whether there were racial/ethnic differences. METHODS: Data from caregivers (N = 243) were collected from the Caring for the Caregiver Network study. Participants' level of self-efficacy, depression, burden, and positive aspects of caregiving was assessed using validated measures. RESULTS: Two self-efficacy subscales predicted caregiver depression, burden, and positive aspects of caregiving. Being White, a spouse, or having a larger social network predicted lower self-efficacy for obtaining respite. Higher income and lower preparedness predicted lower self-efficacy for controlling upsetting thoughts and responding to disruptive behaviors. Self-efficacy for controlling upsetting thoughts mediated the relationship between preparedness and depression along with the relationship between preparedness and burden. Race/ethnicity did not improve model fit. CONCLUSION: Self-efficacy plays an important role in caregiver outcomes. These findings indicate that strategies to improve caregiver self-efficacy should be an integral component of caregiver interventions.
