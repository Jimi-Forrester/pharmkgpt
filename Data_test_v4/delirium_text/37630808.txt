37630808|a|Enzyme-modified lecithin that contains lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) is generally recognized as safe. However, its potential as a functional ingredient has been less investigated than other choline (Ch)-containing compounds, such as glycerophosphocholine (GPC). Reports on the possibility of LPC functioning as a cholinergic precursor in vivo and on its kinetics are limited to docosahexaenoic acid-bound LPC. Herein, three experiments were performed to investigate these processes in scopolamine (SCO)-treated rats. First, an egg-derived LPC reagent was orally administered to rats, and brain acetylcholine (ACh), Ch, plasma Ch, and LPC were measured. Second, soy- and rapeseed-derived enzyme-modified lecithins and GPC were administered for comparison. Third, soy-derived enzyme-modified lecithins with different fat contents were administered for comparison. The LPC reagent mitigated SCO-induced ACh depletion at 500 mg/kg body weight and increased plasma Ch, but not LPC, concentrations. Additionally, soy-derived LPC-containing food additive counteracted brain ACh depletion similarly to GPC. Interestingly, plasma Ch and linoleoyl-LPC levels were higher when soy-derived LPC with a higher fat content was administered, whereas the plasma levels of palmitoyl-LPC decreased and those of total LPC remained constant. In conclusion, egg- and soy-derived LPC species function as cholinergic precursors in vivo, and future studies should explore this potential.
