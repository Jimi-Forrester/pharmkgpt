36740709|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive multifaceted neurodegenerative disorder for which no disease-modifying treatment exists. Neuroinflammation is central to the pathology progression, with evidence suggesting that microglia-released galectin-3 (gal3) plays a pivotal role by amplifying neuroinflammation in AD. However, the possible involvement of gal3 in the disruption of neuronal network oscillations typical of AD remains unknown. METHODS: Here, we investigated the functional implications of gal3 signaling on experimentally induced gamma oscillations ex vivo (20-80 Hz) by performing electrophysiological recordings in the hippocampal CA3 area of wild-type (WT) mice and of the 5xFAD mouse model of AD. In addition, the recorded slices from WT mice under acute gal3 application were analyzed with RT-qPCR to detect expression of some neuroinflammation-related genes, and amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaque load was quantified by immunostaining in the CA3 area of 6-month-old 5xFAD mice with or without Gal3 knockout (KO). RESULTS: Gal3 application decreased gamma oscillation power and rhythmicity in an activity-dependent manner, which was accompanied by impairment of cellular dynamics in fast-spiking interneurons (FSNs) and pyramidal cells. We found that the gal3-induced disruption was mediated by the gal3 carbohydrate-recognition domain and prevented by the gal3 inhibitor TD139, which also prevented Abeta42-induced degradation of gamma oscillations. Furthermore, the 5xFAD mice lacking gal3 (5xFAD-Gal3KO) exhibited WT-like gamma network dynamics and decreased Abeta plaque load. CONCLUSIONS: We report for the first time that gal3 impairs neuronal network dynamics by spike-phase uncoupling of FSNs, inducing a network performance collapse. Moreover, our findings suggest gal3 inhibition as a potential therapeutic strategy to counteract the neuronal network instability typical of AD and other neurological disorders encompassing neuroinflammation and cognitive decline.
