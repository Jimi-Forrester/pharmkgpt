11993196|a|OBJECTIVES: Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is well established as an effective operation to overcome ischemic heart disease; however, the number of aged patients with a high operative risk undergoing this procedure has increased in recent years. This retrospective study evaluates our experience of performing CABG in a consecutive series of patients aged 75 years or older. METHODS: To assess the hospital mortality and morbidity associated with this procedure, we retrospectively analyzed 49 patients aged 75 years or older (Elderly Group) who underwent CABG and compared the results with those of 88 patients aged 65-74 years (Control Group) who underwent CABG during the same period. Patients were examined for cerebrovascular diseases, and those with significant stenosis underwent pulsatile cardiopulmonary bypass. To avoid pulmonary complications, patients were extubated early. RESULTS: The Control Group had a significantly higher incidence of arterial grafts than the Elderly Group (0.8 +/- 0.5 versus 0.3 +/- 0.5; p < 0.0001). The Elderly Group had a significantly higher incidence of postoperative complications than the Control Group, with supraventricular arrhythmia in 57.1% versus 28.4%, (p = 0.0009), delirium in 36.7% versus 11.4%, (p = 0.0004), pneumonia in 6.1% versus 0%, (p = 0.0439), and intubation duration of 88.3 +/- 212.5 hours versus 37.2 +/- 92 hours (p = 0.0296), respectively. However, there was no significant difference in hospital mortality between the two groups, being 8.2% versus, 2.3%, in the Elderly group and Control Group, respectively (p = 0.1867). CONCLUSION: These findings indicated that when elderly patients were appropriately managed, CABG could be performed with an acceptably low risk to mortality.
