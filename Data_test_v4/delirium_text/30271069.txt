30271069|t|Neurobrucellosis Presenting as Acute Psychosis.
30271069|a|A 45-year-old female without any past or family history of psychiatric illness presented to the emergency department with complaints of abnormal behavior, irrelevant talking, restlessness, episodic crying, and decreased sleep of 2-day duration. On detailed interview, the attendants gave a history of an intermittent headache of 6-month duration and hearing impairment of 4-month duration. On investigation, her cerebrospinal fluid was reactive, and brucella titers were positive. She received appropriate treatment for 6 months and a short course of antipsychotics. Her symptoms settled, but she had persistent hearing loss. Psychosis as well as hearing loss is a very rare presentation of brucellosis. The case highlights the importance of considering neurobrucellosis as a differential diagnosis in patients with any unexplained neuropsychiatric symptoms such as acute psychosis or hearing loss.
