24780594|a|With the objective to formulate multifunctional nanosized liposomes to target amyloid deposits in Alzheimer Disease (AD) brains, a lipid-PEG-curcumin derivative was synthesized and characterized. Multifunctional liposomes incorporating the curcumin derivative and additionally decorated with a Blood Brain Barrier (BBB) transport mediator (anti-Transferin antibody) were prepared and characterized. The fluorescence intensity of curcumin derivative was found to increase notably when the curcumin moiety was in the form of a diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA) salt. Both curcumin-derivative liposomes and curcumin-derivative Anti-TrF liposomes showed a high affinity for the amyloid deposits, on post-mortem brains samples of AD patients. The ability of both liposomes to delay Abeta1-42 peptide aggregation was confirmed by Thioflavin assay. However, the decoration of the curcumin-derivative liposomes with the Anti-TrF improved significantly the intake by the BBB cellular model. Results verify that the attachment of an antibody on the curcumin-liposome surface does not block deposit staining or prevention of Abeta aggregation, while the presence of the curcumin-PEG-lipid conjugate does not reduce their brain-targeting capability substantially, proving the potential of such multifunctional NLs for application in Alzheimer disease treatment and diagnosis.
