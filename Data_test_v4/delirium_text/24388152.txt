24388152|a|Many physiological systems in mammals are linked to the body's master circadian rhythm in the sleep/wake cycle and dysfunctions in this rhythm has been associated with neurological diseases such as major depression, Alzheimer's Disease and schizophrenia. There is some evidence that nicotinic cholinergic input to the master circadian pacemaker, the suprachiasmatic nucleus, may modulate circadian activity rhythms, but data employing in vivo preparations is sparse. Therefore we examined the ability of intraperitoneally applied nicotinic agonists and antagonists relatively selective for the alpha7 nicotinic receptor to modulate light-induced phase shifts of hamster circadian wheel running rhythms. Hamsters were maintained in constant darkness and exposed to light pulses early and late in their active period, mimicking dusk and dawn respectively, which elicited phase delays and advances of their circadian wheel running rhythms. The alpha7 receptor antagonists bPiDDB (0.03-3mg/kg) and methyllacaconitine (0.1-1mg/kg) inhibited both light- induced phase advances and delays of circadian wheel running rhythms by as much as 75% versus vehicle injections. In contrast, systemic injections of the alpha7 agonists PHA 543613 and ABT107, both at 0.156-2.5mg/kg, had no effect on light induced phase advances or delays. Further, alpha7 nicotinic receptors were identified in the hamster suprachiasmatic nucleus using an antibody that recognizes alpha7 nicotinic receptors. These results clearly identify the ability of alpha7 nicotinic receptor antagonists to inhibit light-entrainment of the hamster circadian pacemaker. Therefore, nicotinic compounds may be useful for the treatment of circadian dysfunction associated with neurological diseases.
