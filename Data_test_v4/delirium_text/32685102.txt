32685102|t|Molecular Mechanisms of Ferroptosis and Its Role in Pulmonary Disease.
32685102|a|Ferroptosis is a new mode of cell death that is characterized by the excessive accumulation of iron and lipid peroxides. It has unique morphological changes and disparate biochemical features and plays an intricate role in many pathophysiological processes. A great deal of researches confirms that ferroptosis can be regulated by numerous molecules through different mechanisms, supporting great potentials for novel pharmacological therapeutics. Recently, several studies reveal that ferroptosis is also closely associated with the initiation and development of respiratory disease. Understanding the specific mechanism, the molecular trait of ferroptosis and their relationship with pulmonary disease could provide significant references regarding effective treatment of these obstinate disease.
