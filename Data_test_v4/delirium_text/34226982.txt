34226982|a|INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to evaluate the difference of the clinical outcome of elderly patients who were treated surgically or conservatively for a displaced olecranon fracture (Mayo type IIA or IIB). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients above the age of 70 years who were treated surgically (n = 11) for a displaced Mayo type IIA and IIB olecranon fracture between July 2015 and February 2019 were retrospectively compared with patients who were treated conservatively (n = 6). The range of motion, elbow strength, grip strength, VAS, DASH, OES, MEPI and Broberg and Morrey scores were evaluated. RESULTS: The conservative group showed a non-union with a persistent fracture gap of 17 mm (SD 12 mm) at the articular rim and 31 mm (15 mm) at the dorsal rim while there was no case of non-union in the surgical group. The arch of motion was 120  in the conservative group and 136  in the surgical group. There was no obvious difference in elbow extension strength in comparison to the healthy contralateral side (p = 0.20; 88% group I/87% group II). There was no difference in the OES (p = 0.30; 42 (SD 7) vs. 45 (SD 5)) and MEPI score (p = 0.46; (SD 8) vs. 96 (SD 19)). The conservative group presented a slightly worse DASH [p = 0.10; 26 (SD 25) vs 7 (SD 14)] and a significantly worse Broberg and Morrey score (p = 0.02; 84(SD 9) vs. 95 (SD 7)). The conservative group presented one complication (ulnar nerve palsy), while the surgical group presented two cases (prolonged lymphedema; blocked forearm rotation due to screw length with consecutive revision surgery). CONCLUSION: Widely displaced olecranon fractures can successfully be treated conservatively in low-demanding geriatric patients with a satisfactory outcome. Patient selection is essential as patients that are more active might benefit from surgical treatment. Yet, treatment risks and benefits need to be balanced carefully in regard to the patient`s demands and requests.
