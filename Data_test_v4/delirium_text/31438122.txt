31438122|t|Would Geriatric Patients Accept Using a Telemedicine Platform for Post ICU-Discharge Follow-Up Visits?
31438122|a|For those specialized in geriatric medicine, telemedicine innovations provide a new alternative to in-person follow-up care, allowing clinicians to connect and treat patients with more convenience. Telemedicine will likely play a vital role in reaching underserved populations in remote areas. This study investigates first impressions of a telemedicine-based delirium assessment tool. The overall response from participants is positive, supporting the theory that these types of tools will be welcome within the geriatric patient population. Feedback surrounding interactions with the interface are also positive, showing that while many elderly patients may refrain from working with tablets daily, they can successful interact with the tool when needed for care reasons. While this study and sample size are not all-inclusive regarding the diversity of patients and distinct challenges, it serves as a preliminary step towards future research exploring the feasibility and acceptability of such tools within this specific population.
