21353545|t|Structure-activity relationship study of 2,4-diaminothiazoles as Cdk5/p25 kinase inhibitors.
21353545|a|Cdk5/p25 has emerged as a principle therapeutic target for numerous acute and chronic neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. A structure-activity relationship study of 2,4-diaminothiazole inhibitors revealed that increased Cdk5/p25 inhibitory activity could be accomplished by incorporating pyridines on the 2-amino group and addition of substituents to the 2- or 3-position of the phenyl ketone moiety. Interpretation of the SAR results for many of the analogs was aided through in silico docking with Cdk5/p25 and calculating protein hydrations sites using WaterMap. Finally, improved in vitro mouse microsomal stability was also achieved.
