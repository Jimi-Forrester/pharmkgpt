11336563|a|Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which for so many years have played major roles in treating inflammation, pain and fever, have had major recent boosts to various therapeutic aspects. These include the impetus generated by the cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors celecoxib and rofecoxib, a greater understanding of NSAID non-prostaglandin modes of action and the use of NSAIDs in cancer and Alzheimer's disease. Many of these aspects are covered in articles in this issue of Expert Opinion on Pharmacotherapy.
