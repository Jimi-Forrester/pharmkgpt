15486523|t|Treatment of typical Charles Bonnet syndrome with donepezil.
15486523|a|Charles Bonnet syndrome (CBS) is characterized by the presence of complex visual hallucinations in psychologically normal people. Although visual hallucinations in the elderly are often associated with dementia with Lewy body (DLB), Alzheimer's disease and delirium, they are excluded from the diagnosis of typical CBS, as are cognitive or psychiatric disturbances, sleep disorders and focal neurological lesions. Here, we describe a patient with typical CBS, who responded to donepezil, a cholinesterase inhibitor, and has not shown any symptoms suggestive of Alzheimer's disease or DLB for approximately the past 40 months. However, follow-up examination of her clinical symptoms is necessary for a definite exclusion of Alzheimer's disease and DLB. The effectiveness of donepezil indicates that the patient's visual hallucinations might be related to dysfunction of cholinergic neurones, although she did not exhibit any cognitive decline, or morphological and physiological brain pathology. Because donepezil has fewer adverse effects than anticonvulsants and neuroleptic drugs, it may be a safer option for the treatment of CBS in the elderly.
