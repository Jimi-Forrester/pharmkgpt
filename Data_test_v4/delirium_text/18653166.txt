18653166|t|Acquired chromosome instability in the elderly--the effect of diepoxybutane.
18653166|a|Aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been the subject of many studies. It has been suggested that chromosomal alterations may be involved in the etiology and/or pathogenesis of ageing and AD. The purpose of the present study was to examine the effect of diepoxybutane (DEB) on lymphocyte chromosomal instability in the elderly. We examined lymphocytes cytogenetically with, as well as, without DEB treatment, in a group of 12 elderly (range of age 72-96 years), nine of them suffering from AD type. Without DEB treatment six of the donors expressed chromosomal instability in at least 6% of the analyzed cells. After treatment with DEB, lymphocytes showed an increase in the chromosomal instability in up to 20% of the analyzed in eight donors. The sex chromosomes were the main chromosomes involved in the acquired chromosomal abnormalities. It is not clear from this study whether this chromosomal instability is related to the AD. The significance of the involvement of sex chromosomes either in ageing or in AD, as well as, the question whether the chromosomal instability is the cause of or part of ageing processes, has to be addressed.
