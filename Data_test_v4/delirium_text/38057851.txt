38057851|a|As the leading cause of cancer-related mortality, lung cancer continues to pose a menacing threat to human health worldwide. Lung cancer treatment options primarily rely on chemoradiotherapy, surgery, targeted therapy, or immunotherapy. Despite significant progress in research and treatment, the 5-year survival rate for lung cancer patients is only 10-20%. There is an urgent need to develop more reliable preclinical models and valid therapeutic approaches. Patient-derived organoids with highly reduced tumour heterogeneity have emerged as a promising model for high-throughput drug screening to guide treatment of lung cancer patients. Organoid technology offers a novel platform for disease modelling, biobanking and drug development. The expected benefit of organoids is for cancer patients as the subsequent precision medicine technology. Over the past few years, numerous basic and clinical studies have been conducted on lung cancer organoids, highlighting the significant contributions of this technique. This review comprehensively examines the current state-of-the-art technologies and applications relevant to the formation of lung cancer organoids, as well as the potential of organoids in precision medicine and drug testing.
