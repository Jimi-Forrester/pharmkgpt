31328997|t|Use of a Robotic Cat to Treat Terminal Restlessness: A Case Study.
31328997|a|Terminal restlessness and delirium are common clinical issues faced by patients at the end of life. For many providers, recognition and treatment of this condition can be challenging. This becomes increasingly difficult when the dying patient has end-stage Alzheimer's dementia and the patient is manifesting terminal restlessness. Use of both pharmacological and nonpharmacological modalities is often employed for this condition, but the degree of restlessness in this population may not always be readily apparent. In addition, pharmacological therapy, especially antipsychotics, has multiple adverse effects and many nonacute-care hospital facilities may have limitations on its use. Consideration of the use of robotic animal aids has recently been introduced to assist in treating terminal restlessness in this population. This case study describes the effectiveness of using a robotic cat to successfully assist in the treatment of a patient with terminal restlessness.
