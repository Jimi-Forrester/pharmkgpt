38077960|a|Objectives: Antiemetics have been widely recommended for treating opioid-induced nausea and vomiting (OINV). According to a previous study, the use of prophylactic prochlorperazine at the initiation of treatment with oral oxycodone was ineffective in preventing OINV. This study examined whether prochlorperazine injection prevents OINV and induces drowsiness in patients with end-stage cancer (a different patient population from the previous study). Methods: Patients with end-stage cancer who received opioid injections for more than 5 days between April 2017 and March 2020 were classified into two groups: the opioid and prochlorperazine injection group and opioid alone group. Their systemic conditions were evaluated on the basis of the performance status and the palliative performance scale, a prognostic indicator. Results: Of 325 patients who received opioid treatment during the study period, 156 patients met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 103 patients and 53 patients were classified into the opioid and prochlorperazine injection group (prochlorperazine) and opioid alone groups (placebo) , respectively. There was no significant difference in characteristics, age, gender, performance status, or palliative performance scale results between the 2 groups. OINV developed in 4 patients in the opioid and prochlorperazine injection groups and in 1 patient in the opioid alone group. Given that sleep disturbance develops in many patients with end-stage cancer who had a specific condition, it is difficult to conclude regarding the relationship between prochlorperazine injection and drowsiness, although this study examined this relationship. Conclusions: As with the previous study, prophylactic prochlorperazine injection was ineffective in preventing OINV in patients who received opioid injections.
