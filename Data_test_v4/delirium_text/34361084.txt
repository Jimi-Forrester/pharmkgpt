34361084|t|Lipid-Based Nanosystems as a Tool to Overcome Skin Barrier.
34361084|a|Skin may be affected by many disorders that can be treated by topical applications of drugs on the action site. With the advent of nanotechnologies, new efficient delivery systems have been developed. Particularly, lipid-based nanosystems such as liposomes, ethosomes, transferosomes, solid lipid nanoparticles, nanostructured lipid carriers, cubosomes, and monoolein aqueous dispersions have been proposed for cutaneous application, reaching in some cases the market or clinical trials. This review aims to provide an overview of the different lipid-based nanosystems, focusing on their use for topical application. Particularly, biocompatible nanosystems able to dissolve lipophilic compounds and to control the release of carried drug, possibly reducing side effects, are described. Notably, the rationale to topically administer antioxidant molecules by lipid nanocarriers is described. Indeed, the structural similarity between the nanosystem lipid matrix and the skin lipids allows the achievement of a transdermal effect. Surely, more research is required to better understand the mechanism of interaction between lipid-based nanosystems and skin. However, this attempt to summarize and highlight the possibilities offered by lipid-based nanosystems could help the scientific community to take advantage of the benefits derived from this kind of nanosystem.
