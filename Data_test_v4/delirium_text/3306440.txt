3306440|t|Calcium-channel-blocking agent in the treatment of acute alcohol withdrawal--caroverine versus meprobamate in a randomized double-blind study.
3306440|a|We present a randomized double-blind study on the efficacy of caroverine in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal symptoms. The group B Ca2+ channel blocking agent caroverine was tested against meprobamate in inpatient treatment of alcohol withdrawal. Patients of both groups were similar in age, weight, duration of drinking, ingested quantities of alcohol and intensity of withdrawal symptoms in both groups. The symptoms were quantified daily by Syndromkurztest (SKT), Nurses' Observation Scale for Inpatient Evaluation (NOSIE), NGI; the Webster scale was applied to rate tremor, speech and coping. Duration of study was scheduled for 5 days after which other medication, e.g., levopromazine was applied if needed. As caroverine is registered and used as a spasmolytic drug in Austria, patients' verbal consent was sufficient. In both compounds we registered no difference of clinical efficacy, though caroverine presented less sedative side effects. This may be an important factor in the treatment and management of alcohol withdrawal symptoms. Dose ranges were 120 mg/day vs. 2,400 mg/day of caroverine and meprobamate, respectively. Thus, drug loading and metabolism can be thoroughly reduced by the application of caroverine--another important point in treatment of alcoholism. In 4 cases of manifest delirium tremens the infusional application of caroverine was openly tested with dose ranges of 2.5-5.0 mg/kg (24 h). Clinical effects were estimated to be similar with oral application as was therapeutic efficacy. This novel indication of a group-B Ca2+ channel blocker presents an interesting feature, which seems to warrant further investigation.
