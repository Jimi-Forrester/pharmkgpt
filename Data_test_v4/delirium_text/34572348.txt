34572348|a|The contribution of mouse models for basic and translational research at different levels is important to understand neurodegenerative diseases, including tauopathies, by studying the alterations in the corresponding mouse models in detail. Moreover, several studies demonstrated that pathological as well as behavioral changes are influenced by the sex. For this purpose, we performed an in-depth characterization of the behavioral alterations in the transgenic Tau-P301L mouse model. Sex-matched wild type and homozygous Tau-P301L mice were tested in a battery of behavioral tests at different ages. Tau-P301L male mice showed olfactory and motor deficits as well as increased Tau pathology, which was not observed in Tau-P301L female mice. Both Tau-P301L male and female mice had phenotypic alterations in the SHIRPA test battery and cognitive deficits in the novel object recognition test. This study demonstrated that Tau-P301L mice have phenotypic alterations, which are in line with the histological changes and with a sex-dependent performance in those tests. Summarized, the Tau-P301L mouse model shows phenotypic alterations due to the presence of neurofibrillary tangles in the brain.
