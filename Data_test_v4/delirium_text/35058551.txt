35058551|a|In the present study, galactan exopolysaccharide (EPS) from Weissella confusa KR780676 was evaluated for its potential to alleviate oxidative stress using in vitro assays and in vivo studies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (wild type) and its antioxidant (sod1 , sod2 , tsa1 , cta2  and ctt1 ), anti-apoptotic (pep4  and fis1 ) and anti-aging (sod2 , tsa1  and ctt1 )) isogenic gene deletion mutants. Galactan exhibited strong DPPH and nitric oxide scavenging activity with an IC50 value of 450 and 138 microg/mL respectively. In the yeast mutant model, oxidative stress generated by H2O2 was extensively scavenged by galactan in the medium as confirmed using spot assays followed by fluorescencent DCF-DA staining and microscopic studies. Galactan treatment resulted in reduction in the ROS generated in the yeast mutant cells as demonstrated by decreased fluorescence intensity. Furthermore, galactan exhibited protection against oxidative damage through H2O2 -induced apoptosis inhibition in the yeast mutant strains (pep4  and fis1 ) leading to increased survival rate by neutralizing the oxidative stress. In the chronological life span assay, WT cells treated with galactan EPS showed 8% increase in viability whereas sod2  mutant showed 10-15% increase indicating pronounced anti-aging effects. Galactan from W. confusa KR780676 has immense potential to be used as a natural antioxidant for nutraceutical, pharmaceutical and food technological applications. As per our knowledge, this is the first report on in-depth assessment of in vivo antioxidant properties of a bacterial EPS in a yeast deletion model system.
