32116789|t|Polyunsaturated Fatty Acid Composition of Cerebrospinal Fluid Fractions Shows Their Contribution to Cognitive Resilience of a Pre-symptomatic Alzheimer's Disease Cohort.
32116789|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology is characterized by an early and prolonged decrease in the amyloid peptide (Abeta) levels concomitant with a later increase in phospho-tau concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). We propose that changes in lipid metabolism can contribute to the abnormal processing of Abeta42 in AD. Our aim was to determine if polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) metabolism can differentiate pre-symptomatic AD from normal aging and symptomatic AD. Using neuropsychology measures and Abeta42/T-tau in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), we classify three groups of elderly study participants: cognitively healthy with normal Abeta42/T-tau (CH-NAT), cognitively healthy with pathological Abeta42/T-tau (CH-PAT), and AD individuals. We determined the size distribution and the concentration of CSF particles using light scattering and quantified PUFA composition in the nanoparticulate (NP) fraction, supernatant fluid (SF), and unesterified PUFA levels using gas chromatography combined with mass spectrometry. Four PUFAs (C20:2n-6, C20:3n-3, C22:4n-6, C22:5n-3) were enriched in NP of AD compared with CH-NAT. C20:3n-3 levels were higher in the NP fraction from AD compared with CH-PAT. When normalized to the number of NPs in CSF, PUFA levels were significantly higher in CH-NAT and CH-PAT compared with AD. In the SF fractions, only the levels of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, C22:6n-3) differentiated all three clinical groups. Unesterified DHA was also higher in CH-NAT compared with the other clinical groups. Our studies also show that NP PUFAs in CH participants negatively correlate with CSF Abeta42 while C20:4n-6, DHA, and n-3 PUFAs in the SF fraction positively correlate with T-tau. The profile of PUFAs in different CSF fractions that correlate with Abeta42 or with T-tau are different for CH-NAT compared with CH-PAT. These studies show that PUFA metabolism is associated with amyloid and tau processing. Importantly, higher PUFA levels in the cognitively healthy study participants with abnormal Abeta42/T-tau suggest that PUFA enhances the cognitive resilience of the pre-symptomatic AD population. We propose that interventions that prevent PUFA depletion in the brain may prevent AD pathology by stabilizing Abeta42 and tau metabolism. Further studies to determine changes in PUFA composition during the progression from pre-symptomatic to AD should reveal novel biomarkers and potential preventive approaches.
