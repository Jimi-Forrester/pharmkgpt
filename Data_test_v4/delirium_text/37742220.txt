37742220|a|Alcohol withdrawal syndrome is one of the most important consequences of alcohol use disorder, a complex neuropsychiatric disorder, which is firstly treated in non-specific and secondly in psychiatric/addictive in- or outpatient units. On the other hand, alcohol withdrawal syndrome is one of the most important outcomes of the severity of alcohol use disorder, further, it can lead to the development of alcohol-related seizure and delirium tremens. Hence, early recognition and optimal treatment of alcohol withdrawal syndrome have a critical importance. Therefore, the main goal of the present review was - by systematically summarizing the scientific data published during the past two decades - to form a unique diagnostic and therapeutic algorithm. During the recognition and the course of alcohol withdrawal syndrome, the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol, Revised scale, while in the risk assessment the Prediction of Alcohol Withdrawal Severity Scale are the recommended psychometric tools. Benzodiazepines are the key elements of the pharmacotherapy of alcohol withdrawal syndrome. Many studies have evaluated that diazepam, chlordiazepoxide, lorazepam and oxazepam with distinct indications have sufficient evidence in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal syndrome. However, in the past few years some authors have recommended the importance of non-benzodiazepine medications. The efficacy of propofol, phenobarbital, carbamazepin, oxcarbamazepin and alpha-2 receptor agonists in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal syndrome have been revealed. Furthermore, it has been evaluated that benzodiazepines are recommended in the treatment of alcohol-related seizure and delirium tremens. In the present review, our aim was to construct a unique, up-to-date diagnostic and therapeutic algorithm by summarizing the related papers published during the past two decades. Hence this scheme may be useful in the optimal treatment of patients diagnosed with alcohol use disorder and it could help to conduct further clinical researches. Orv Hetil. 2023; 164(38): 1487-1496.
