34564146|t|Marine Algae-Derived Bioactive Compounds: A New Wave of Nanodrugs?
34564146|a|Marine algae are rich in bioactive nutraceuticals (e.g., carbohydrates, proteins, minerals, fatty acids, antioxidants, and pigments). Biotic (e.g., plants, microorganisms) and abiotic factors (e.g., temperature, pH, salinity, light intensity) contribute to the production of primary and secondary metabolites by algae. Easy, profitable, and sustainable recovery methods include novel solid-liquid and liquid-liquid extraction techniques (e.g., supercritical, high pressure, microwave, ultrasound, enzymatic). The spectacular findings of algal-mediated synthesis of nanotheranostics has attracted further interest because of the availability of microalgae-based natural bioactive therapeutic compounds and the cost-effective commercialization of stable microalgal drugs. Algal extracts can serve as stabilizing/capping and reducing agents for the synthesis of thermodynamically stable nanoparticles (NPs). Different types of nanotherapeutics have been synthesized using physical, chemical, and biological methods. Marine algae are a fascinating source of lead theranostics compounds, and the development of nanotheranostics has been linked to enhanced drug efficacy and safety. Indeed, algae are remarkable nanobiofactories, and their pragmatic properties reside in their (i) ease of handling; (ii) capacity to absorb/accumulate inorganic metallic ions; (iii) cost-effectiveness; and (iv) capacity of eco-friendly, rapid, and healthier synthesis of NPs. Preclinical and clinical trials shall enable to really define effective algal-based nanotherapies. This review aims to provide an overview of the main algal compounds that are nutraceuticals and that can be extracted and purified for nanotheranostic purposes.
