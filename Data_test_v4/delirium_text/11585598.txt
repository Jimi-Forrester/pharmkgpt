11585598|t|Chromosome 12 and late-onset Alzheimer's disease.
11585598|a|Alzheimer's disease is a complex neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by cognitive decline and distinctive neuropathology. Using large extended families with multiple affected, we found that three markers on chromosome 12 were linked with late-onset Alzheimer's disease. These markers were downstream from the gene for alpha-2 macroglobulin. It is likely that multiple genes will be identified either as risk factors or as causative agents for late-onset Alzheimer's disease.
