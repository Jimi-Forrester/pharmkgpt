39065109|t|Effect of Probiotic Bacteria on the Gut Microbiome of Mice with Lipopolysaccharide-Induced Inflammation.
39065109|a|The role of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the development of diseases is clear, but the specific mechanisms remain poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate the microbiome aberrations in the guts of mice against the background of LPS, as well as the anti-inflammatory effect of probiotic supplementation with Lactobacillus plantarum from the gut, a mix of commercial probiotic lactic acid bacteria, and Weissella confusa isolated from milk using next-generation sequencing. LPS injections were found to induce inflammatory changes in the intestinal mucosa. These morphological changes were accompanied by a shift in the microbiota. We found no significant changes in the microbiome with probiotic supplementation compared to the LPS group. However, when Lactobacillus plantarum and a mix of commercial probiotic lactic acid bacteria were used, the intestinal mucosa was restored. Weissella confusa did not contribute to the morphological changes of the intestinal wall or the microbiome. Changes in the microbiome were observed with probiotic supplementation of Lactobacillus plantarum and a mix of commercial probiotic lactic acid bacteria compared to the control group. In addition, when Lactobacillus plantarum was used, we observed a decrease in the enrichment of the homocysteine and cysteine interconversion pathways with an increase in the L-histidine degradation pathway.
