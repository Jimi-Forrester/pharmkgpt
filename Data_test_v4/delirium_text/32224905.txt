32224905|t|Nanoantioxidant-Based Silica Particles as Flavonoid Carrier for Drug Delivery Applications.
32224905|a|Nanosystems used in pharmaceutical formulations have shown promising results in enhancing the administration of drugs of difficult formulations. In particular, porous silica nanoparticles have demonstrated excellent properties for application in biological systems; however, there are still several challenges related to the development of more effective and biocompatible materials. An interesting approach to enhance these nanomaterials has been the development of nanoantioxidant carriers. In this work, a hybrid nanoantioxidant carrier based on porous silica nanoplatform with rosmarinic acid antioxidant immobilized on its surface were developed and characterized. Techniques such as dynamic light scattering (DLS), zeta potential, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), N2 adsorption-desorption measurements, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH ) assay were used to characterize and evaluate the antioxidant activity of nanocarriers. In addition, drug release profile was evaluated using two biorelevant media. The antioxidant activity of rosmarinic acid was maintained, suggesting the correct disposition of the moiety. Kinetic studies reveal that more morin is released in the simulated intestinal fluid than in the gastric one, while an anomalous non-Fickian release mechanism was observed. These results suggest a promising antioxidant nanocarrier suitable for future application in drug delivery.
