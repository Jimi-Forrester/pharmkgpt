37202895|t|Assessment of Anticholinergic and Antidiabetic Properties of Some Natural and Synthetic Molecules: an In Vitro and In Silico Approach.
37202895|a|INTRODUCTION: In this study, it was aimed to determine the in vitro and in silico effects of some natural and synthetic molecules on acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) and alpha-glucosidase enzymes. BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM), which are considered amongst the most important diseases of today's world. However, the side effects of therapeutic agents used in both diseases limit their use. Therefore, it is important to develop drugs with high therapeutic efficacy and better pharmacological profile. OBJECTIVE: This study sets out to determine the related enzyme inhibitors used in the treatment of AD and T2DM, which are considered amongst the most important diseases of today's world. METHODS: In the current study, the in vitro and in silico effects of dienestrol, hesperetin, L-thyroxine, 3,3',5-Triiodo-L-thyronine (T3) and dobutamine molecules on AChE, BChE and alpha-glycosidase enzyme activities were investigated. RESULTS: All the molecules showed an inhibitory effect on the enzymes. The IC50 and Ki values of the L-Thyroxine molecule, which showed the strongest inhibition effect for the AChE enzyme, were determined as 1.71 microM and 0.83+-0.195 microM, respectively. In addition, dienestrol, T3 and dobutamine molecules showed a more substantial inhibition effect than tacrine. Dobutamine molecule showed the most substantial inhibition effect for BChE enzyme, and IC50 and Ki values were determined as 1.83 microM and 0.845+-0.143 microM, respectively. The IC50 and Ki values for the hesperetin molecule, which showed the strongest inhibition for the alpha-glycosidase enzyme, were determined as 13.57 microM and 12.33+-2.57 microM, respectively. CONCLUSION: According to the results obtained, it may be said that the molecules used in the study are potential inhibitor candidates for AChE, BChE and alpha-glycosidase.
