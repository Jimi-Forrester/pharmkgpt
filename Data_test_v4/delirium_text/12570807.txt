12570807|a|Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder marked by loss of memory, cognition, and behavioral stability. AD is defined pathologically by extracellular neuritic plaques comprised of fibrillar deposits of beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) and neurofibrillary tangles comprised of paired helical filaments of hyperphosphorylated tau. Current therapies for AD, such as cholinesterase inhibitors, treat the symptoms but do not modify the progression of the disease. The etiology of AD is unclear. However, data from familial AD mutations (FAD) strongly support the "amyloid cascade hypothesis" of AD, i.e. that neurodegeneration in AD is initiated by the formation of neurotoxic beta-amyloid (Abeta) aggregates; all FAD mutations increase levels of Abeta peptide or density of Abeta deposits. The likely link between Abeta aggregation and AD pathology emphasizes the need for a better understanding of the mechanisms of Abeta production. This review summarizes current therapeutic strategies directed at lowering Abeta levels and decreasing levels of toxic Abeta aggregates through (1) inhibition of the processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) to Abeta peptide, (2) inhibition, reversal or clearance of Abeta aggregation, (3) cholesterol reduction and (4) Abeta immunization.
