34483912|a|Parkinson's disease is a highly prevalent neurological disorder for which there is currently no cure. Therefore, the knowledge of risk factors as well as the development of new putative molecular targets is mandatory. In this sense, peripheral inflammation, especially the originated in the colon, is emerging as a predisposing factor for suffering this disease. We have largely studied the pleiotropic roles of galectin-3 in driving microglia-associated immune responses. However, studies aimed at elucidating the role of galectin-3 in peripheral inflammation in terms of microglia polarization are lacking. To achieve this, we have evaluated the effect of galectin-3 deletion in two different models of acute peripheral inflammation: intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide or gut inflammation induced by oral administration of dextran sodium sulfate. We found that under peripheral inflammation the number of microglial cells and the expression levels of pro-inflammatory mediators take place specifically in the dopaminergic system, thus supporting causative links between Parkinson's disease and peripheral inflammation. Absence of galectin-3 highly reduced neuroinflammation in both models, suggesting an important central regulatory role of galectin-3 in driving microglial activation provoked by the peripheral inflammation. Thus, modulation of galectin-3 function emerges as a promising strategy to minimize undesired microglia polarization states.
