METHODS: Eighty ASA I - II induced abortion patients were randomly divided into 4 groups. Group I was administrated 1 microg/kg with tramadol first, after 10 minutes with 2 mg/kg propofol. Group II was administrated with 1 mg/kg tramadol first, after 10 minutes with 2 mg/kg propofol. Group III was administrated flurbiprofen axetil 50 mg first, after 10 minutes 2 mg/kg propofol. Group IV was administrated propofol 2 mg/kg. The speed of intravenous injection of propofol was 100 mg/min in all groups. Induction time, recovery time, propofol dosage, HR, BP, SpO2, and side effect were recorded. The anesthesia effect was judged by operation doctors. RESULTS: Propofol consumption and awaken time in Group IV was more than those of other groups. The number of patients in Group I with minimum value of SpO2 in the operation (85% - 90% or SpO2<85%) was higher than that of other groups (P<0.05). The number of patients in Group I and II with the tongue falling backwards during anesthesia, with post-anesthesia nausea and vomit was higher than that of other groups (P<0.05). Incidences of post-anesthesia excitement or delirium were higher than other groups. Fewer patients in Group IV showed a good level anesthesia effect than other groups. The post-operative hypogastric pain of VAS score (0 - 2) in Group III was better than others. CONCLUSION: Propofol combined with flurbiprofen axetil gives more efficient anesthesia for induced abortion patients in gynecology department. It can not only have satisfactory anesthesia effect, but also decrease adverse effects and obtain better depression effects to the post-operative hypogastric pain.
