34595366|a|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether frailty or age increases the risk of postoperative complications following cochlear implant (CI) surgery. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Tertiary academic center. METHODS: An evaluation of all adult patients undergoing cochlear implantation between 2006 and 2020 was performed. The 5-item Modified Frailty Index (mFI-5, comprising preoperative history of pulmonary disease, heart failure, hypertension, diabetes, and partially/totally dependent functional status) was calculated for all patients included in analysis in addition to demographic characteristics. The primary outcome was postoperative complications following CI within a 3-month period. Major complications included myocardial infarction, bleeding, and cerebrospinal fluid leak, among others. Predictors of postoperative complications were examined using multivariable logistic regression reporting odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs. RESULTS: There were 520 patients included for review with a median age of 68 (range, 18-94) years and a slight male predominance (n = 283, 54.4%). There were 340 patients (65.4%) who were robust (nonfrail) with an mFI of 0, while 180 (34.6%) had an mFI of >=1. There were 20 patients who experienced a postoperative complication (3.85%). There was no statistically significant association between postoperative complications as a result of preoperative frailty (OR, 1.56; 95% CI, 0.98-2.48, P = .06) or age as a continuous variable (OR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.97-1.02, P = .51). CONCLUSIONS: CI is safe for elderly and frail patients and carries no additional risk of complications when compared to younger, healthier patients. While medical comorbidities should always be considered perioperatively, this study supports the notion that implantation is low risk in older, frail patients.
