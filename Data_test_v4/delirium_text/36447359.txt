36447359|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by beta-amyloid (Abeta) plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, neuronal cell loss, and oxidative stress. Further deposition of Abeta in the brain induces oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and memory dysfunction. Hawthorn (Crataegus pinnatifida Bge.) leaf, a known traditional Chinese medicine, is commonly used for the treatment of hyperlipidemia, heart palpitations, forgetfulness, and tinnitus, and its main bioactive components are Hawthorn Leaf Flavonoids (HLF). In this study, we investigated the neuroprotective effects of the HLF on the Abeta25-35 (bilateral hippocampus injection) rat model of AD. The results showed that the oral administration of HLF at a dose of 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg for 30 days significantly ameliorated neuronal cell damage and memory deficits, and markedly increased the enzyme activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase, and the content of glutathione whereas it decreased the malondialdehyde content in the Abeta25-35 rat model of AD as well as suppressed the activation of astrocytes. In addition, HLF up-regulated Nrf-2, NQO-1, and HO-1 protein expressions. Also, it reduced neuroinflammation by inhibiting activation of astrocytes. In summary, these results indicated that HLF decreased the oxidative stress via activating Nrf-2/antioxidant response element signaling pathways, and may suggest as a potential candidate for AD therapeutic agent.
