31467131|a|Of the two human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) species, human herpesvirus 6B (HHV-6B) encephalitis is an important cause of morbidity and mortality after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Guidelines for the management of HHV-6 infections in patients with hematologic malignancies or post-transplant were prepared a decade ago but there have been no other guidelines since then despite significant advances in the understanding of HHV-6 encephalitis, its therapy, and other aspects of HHV-6 disease in this patient population. Revised guidelines prepared at the 2017 European Conference on Infections in Leukaemia covering diagnosis, preventative strategies and management of HHV-6 disease are now presented.
