31748951|a|BACKGROUND: Patients with right heart failure pose significant volume management challenges for hemodynamic optimization. We present two cases in which point of care ultrasound (POCUS) of the hepatic and portal veins contributed to the venous hypertension assessment and decongestive strategy for patients with right-sided heart failure. CASE PRESENTATION: Patient A was 91 years old with known pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular systolic dysfunction who presented in septic shock requiring vasopressor support. Hepatic and portal vein Dopplers were consistent with right heart failure and significant venous congestion, therefore, diuresis was initiated which resulted in portal flow normalization, renal recovery, and cessation of vasopressor support. Patient B was 82 years old with severe idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis on home oxygen who presented in decompensated right heart failure. Despite aggressive diuresis, a negative fluid balance was not achieved. The patient continued to deteriorate and prior to their death portal vein, Doppler showed significant flow reversal. CONCLUSION: Hepatic and portal vein Doppler ultrasounds are venous hypertension assessment tools that can be readily used at the bedside by clinicians trained in POCUS that may contribute holistically to the hemodynamic profiling for patients with right heart failure and direct therapeutic interventions.
