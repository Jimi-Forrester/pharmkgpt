METHODS: We studied 311 cognitively normal older adults who participated in the population-based Mayo Clinic Study of Aging from January 2009 through September 2010. Participants underwent (11)C-Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) PET, (1)H MRS from the posterior cingulate gyri, and neuropsychometric testing to assess memory, attention/executive, language, and visual-spatial domain functions within 6 months. Partial Spearman rank order correlations were adjusted for age, sex, and education. RESULTS: Higher PiB retention was associated with abnormal elevations in myoinositol (mI)/creatine (Cr) (partial r(s) = 0.17; p = 0.003) and choline (Cho)/Cr (partial r(s) = 0.13; p = 0.022) ratios. Higher Cho/Cr was associated with worse performance on Auditory Verbal Learning Test Delayed Recall (partial r(s) = -0.12; p = 0.04), Trail Making Test Part B (partial r(s) = 0.12; p = 0.04), Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised (WAIS-R) Digit Symbol (partial r(s) = -0.18; p < 0.01), and WAIS-R Block Design (partial r(s) = -0.12; p = 0.03). Associations between (1)H MRS metabolites and cognitive function were not different among participants with high vs low PiB retention. CONCLUSION: In cognitively normal older adults, the (1)H MRS metabolite ratios mI/Cr and Cho/Cr are associated with the preclinical pathologic processes in the Alzheimer disease cascade. Higher Cho/Cr is associated with worse performance on domain-specific cognitive tests independent of Abeta load, suggesting that Cho/Cr elevation may also be dependent on other preclinical dementia pathologies characterized by Cho/Cr elevation such as Lewy body or ischemic vascular disease in addition to Abeta load.
