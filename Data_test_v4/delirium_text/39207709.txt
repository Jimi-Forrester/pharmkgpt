39207709|t|Microglia in Neurodegenerative Diseases.
39207709|a|Neurodegenerative diseases are manifested by a progressive death of neural cells, resulting in the deterioration of central nervous system (CNS) functions, ultimately leading to specific behavioural and cognitive symptoms associated with affected brain regions. Several neurodegenerative disorders are caused by genetic variants or mutations, although the majority of cases are sporadic and linked to various environmental risk factors, with yet an unknown aetiology. Neuroglial changes are fundamental and often lead to the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases. In particular, microglial cells, which are essential for maintaining CNS health, become compromised in their physiological functions with the exposure to environmental risk factors, genetic variants or mutations, as well as disease pathology. In this chapter, we cover the contribution of neuroglia, especially microglia, to several neurodegenerative diseases, including Nasu-Hakola disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, infectious disease-associated neurodegeneration, and metal-precipitated neurodegeneration. Future research perspectives for the field pertaining to the therapeutic targeting of microglia across these disease conditions are also discussed.
