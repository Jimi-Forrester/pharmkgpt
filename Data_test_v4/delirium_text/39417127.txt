39417127|t|Effect of Ventilator Mode on Ventilator-Free Days in Critically Ill Adults: A Randomized Trial.
39417127|a|Rationale: For critically ill adults receiving invasive mechanical ventilation, the ventilator mode determines how breaths are delivered. Whether the choice of ventilator mode affects outcomes for critically ill patients is unknown. To compare the effects of three common ventilator modes (volume control, pressure control, and adaptive pressure control) on death and duration of mechanical ventilation. Methods: We conducted a pragmatic, cluster-randomized, crossover trial among adults receiving invasive mechanical ventilation in a medical ICU between November 1, 2022 and July 31, 2023. Each month, patients in the participating unit were assigned to receive volume control, pressure control, or adaptive pressure control during continuous mandatory ventilation. The primary outcome was ventilator-free days through 28 days. Results: Among 566 patients included in the primary analysis, the median number of ventilator-free days was 23 [IQR, 0-26] in the volume control group, 22 [0-26] in the pressure control group, and 24 [0-26] in the adaptive pressure control group (P=0.60). The median tidal volume was similar in the three groups, but the percentage of breaths larger than 8mL/kg of predicted body weight differed between volume control (median, 4.0%; IQR, 0.0-14.1), pressure control (10.6%; 0.0-31.5), and adaptive pressure control (4.7%; 0.0-19.2). Incidences of hypoxemia, acidemia, and barotrauma were similar in the three groups. Conclusions: Among critically ill adults receiving invasive mechanical ventilation, the use of volume control, pressure control, or adaptive pressure control did not affect the number of ventilator-free days, however, confidence intervals included differences that may be clinically meaningful.
