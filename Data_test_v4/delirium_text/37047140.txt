37047140|t|The Interplay between Integrins and Immune Cells as a Regulator in Cancer Immunology.
37047140|a|Integrins are a group of heterodimers consisting of alpha and beta subunits that mediate a variety of physiological activities of immune cells, including cell migration, adhesion, proliferation, survival, and immunotolerance. Multiple types of integrins act differently on the same immune cells, while the same integrin may exert various effects on different immune cells. In the development of cancer, integrins are involved in the regulation of cancer cell proliferation, invasion, migration, and angiogenesis; conversely, integrins promote immune cell aggregation to mediate the elimination of tumors. The important roles of integrins in cancer progression have provided valuable clues for the diagnosis and targeted treatment of cancer. Furthermore, many integrin inhibitors have been investigated in clinical trials to explore effective regimens and reduce side effects. Due to the complexity of the mechanism of integrin-mediated cancer progression, challenges remain in the research and development of cancer immunotherapies (CITs). This review enumerates the effects of integrins on four types of immune cells and the potential mechanisms involved in the progression of cancer, which will provide ideas for more optimal CIT in the future.
