38256247|t|The Research Progress of Mitochondrial Transplantation in the Treatment of Mitochondrial Defective Diseases.
38256247|a|Mitochondria are double-membrane organelles that are involved in energy production, apoptosis, and signaling in eukaryotic cells. Several studies conducted over the past decades have correlated mitochondrial dysfunction with various diseases, including cerebral ischemia, myocardial ischemia-reperfusion, and cancer. Mitochondrial transplantation entails importing intact mitochondria from healthy tissues into diseased tissues with damaged mitochondria to rescue the injured cells. In this review, the different mitochondrial transplantation techniques and their clinical applications have been discussed. In addition, the challenges and future directions pertaining to mitochondrial transplantation and its potential in the treatment of diseases with defective mitochondria have been summarized.
