37719873|t|An eXplainability Artificial Intelligence approach to brain connectivity in Alzheimer's disease.
37719873|a|The advent of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has revolutionized the way human experts, especially from non-computational domains, approach artificial intelligence; this is particularly true for clinical applications where the transparency of the results is often compromised by the algorithmic complexity. Here, we investigate how Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects brain connectivity within a cohort of 432 subjects whose T1 brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging data (MRI) were acquired within the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). In particular, the cohort included 92 patients with AD, 126 normal controls (NC) and 214 subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). We show how graph theory-based models can accurately distinguish these clinical conditions and how Shapley values, borrowed from game theory, can be adopted to make these models intelligible and easy to interpret. Explainability analyses outline the role played by regions like putamen, middle and superior temporal gyrus; from a class-related perspective, it is possible to outline specific regions, such as hippocampus and amygdala for AD and posterior cingulate and precuneus for MCI. The approach is general and could be adopted to outline how brain connectivity affects specific brain regions.
