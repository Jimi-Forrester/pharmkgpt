37842611|a|Video propaganda is reported effectively improving patients' understanding of operation. However, whether a video introducing patients' most concerns can reduce preoperative anxiety and promote recovery stays unsealed. In this study, we investigated the effects of complementary therapy of educational video during preoperative visit. The results showed that thirty-five (23.2%) parents in Group Control were diagnosed as anxiety according to SAS, and nineteen (12.3%) patients were diagnosed after video intervention. The APAIs anxiety score and APAIs information score in Group Video were lower than those in Group Control. Compared with Group Control, video visit helped to increase the first-attempt pass rate of the knowledge retention exam and solve the patient's most worried concerns, and decrease incidence of emergence agitation, total cost of hospitalization and length of hospital stay. Moreover, video visit improved satisfaction degrees of patients and their main family members. Briefly, our study demonstrated video visit can improve patients' knowledge of anesthesia and decrease their preoperative anxiety, which may represent an important complementary therapy to routine preoperative visits.
