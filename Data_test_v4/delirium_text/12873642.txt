12873642|a|The effects of intracerebroventricular and intraseptal (the medial septum) administration of a prototypical acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (AChE-I), physostigmine, and a classic benzodiazepine midazolam on rat behavior in the open field test of neophobia and in the conditioned fear test (freezing reaction) were examined in rats. In the open field test of neophobia midazolam and physostigmine increased at a limited dose range, rat exploratory activity, after intracerebroventricular injection. Physostigmine produced in addition the hyperlocomotory effect. Following intraseptal injections, only physostigmine selectively prolonged the time spent by animals in the central sector of the open field. In the model of a conditioned fear, both midazolam and physostigmine inhibited rat freezing reaction to the aversively conditioned context after intracerebroventricular, but not after intraseptal, pretrial drug administration. The presented data support the notion about the selective anxiolytic-like effects of some AChE-Is. It appears, therefore, that the calming and sedative effects of AChE-Is observed in patients with Alzheimer's disease may be directly related to their anxiolytic action, independent of an improvement in cognitive functions, which in turn may decrease disorientation-induced distress and anxiety.
