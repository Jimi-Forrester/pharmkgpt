37272986|a|INTRODUCTION: Spinal fractures in fused spines such as in ankylosing spondylitis or DISH are typically of type B or C fractures where operative treatment is recommended. The mortality rate in non-operatively treated patients is reported to be 51%. The purpose of this study was to investigate the mortality rate, complication rate and demographics of patients following non-operatively treatment in fused spine injuries. METHODS: Between 2019 and 2021, a retrospective study was conducted including all patients who presented to our trauma center with a spinal fracture of a fused spine. Radiology and patient charts were analyzed for fracture pattern, complications, neurological deficit, comorbidities, and mortality rate. RESULTS: A total of 49 patients were found at a mean age was 79.8 +- 10.9 years and primarily males were affected in 65.3%. All fractures were of type B and the thoracic spine was involved in 85.7%. The mean follow-up was 6.3 +- 8.2 months and fusion was obtained in all patients. No neurological deficit was observed in any. A total of 13 patients died at a mean age of 86.5 +- 10.0 years after 157.1 +- 158.1 days. 6 patients (10.2%) deceased within the first 6 weeks at a mean age of 91.8 +- 3.8 years. One patient each suffered from heart failure, an acute delirium, end stage colon cancer and subdural hemorrhage. CONCLUSION: This study shows that the mortality rate in the first 6 weeks following a fracture in a fused spine is 10.2% for patients above the age of 90 years. Therefore, non-operative treatment should be taken into consideration as the mortality rate in other studies may be overestimated. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III, retrospective study.
