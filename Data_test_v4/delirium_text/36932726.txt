36932726|t|The innate immune response in tauopathies.
36932726|a|Tauopathies, which include frontotemporal dementia, Alzheimer's disease, and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, are a class of neurological disorders resulting from pathogenic tau aggregates. These aggregates disrupt neuronal health and function leading to the cognitive and physical decline of tauopathy patients. Genome-wide association studies and clinical evidence have brought to light the large role of the immune system in inducing and driving tau-mediated pathology. More specifically, innate immune genes are found to harbor tauopathy risk alleles and innate immune pathways are upregulated throughout the course of disease. Experimental evidence has expanded on these findings by describing pivotal roles for the innate immune system in the regulation of tau kinases and tau aggregates. In this review, we summarize the literature implicating innate immune pathways as drivers of tauopathy. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
