36566649|a|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of nalbuphine on emergence agitation (EA) in children undergoing adenotonsillectomy. DESIGN: Multicenter, prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled trial. SETTING: The First People's Hospital of Foshan and three other participating institutions in China, from April 2020 to December 2021. PATIENTS: Eight hundred patients, 3-9 years of age, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification I or II, undergoing elective adenotonsillectomy were included. INTERVENTIONS: Nalbuphine (0.1 mg/kg) or saline was administered intravenously. MEASUREMENTS: The incidence of EA; the pediatric anesthesia emergence delirium (PAED) scale; and the faces, legs, activity, cry, and consolability (FLACC) scales. Extubation time, duration of post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) stay, anesthesia nurses' and parents' satisfaction, and other side effects. MAIN RESULTS: The incidence of EA in the nalbuphine group was lower than that in the saline group 30 min after extubation (10.28% vs. 28.39%, P = 0.000). In addition, the FLACC scores in the nalbuphine group were lower than those in the saline group 30 min after extubation (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the proportion of moderate-to-severe pain cases (FLACC scores >3) was significantly lower in the nalbuphine group than in the saline group (33.58% vs. 60.05%, P = 0.000). Adjusting the imbalance of postoperative pain intensity, the risk of EA was still lower in the nalbuphine group at 0 min (OR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.26-0.60; P = 0.000), (OR, odds ratio; CI, confidence interval), 10 min (OR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.19-0.79; P = 0.01), and 20 min (OR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.08-0.99; P = 0.046) than in the saline group. There were no significant differences in extubation time, duration of PACU stay, nausea and vomiting, or respiratory depression between the two groups (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Nalbuphine reduced the incidence of EA in children after adenotonsillectomy under general anesthesia, which may be involved in both analgesic and non-analgesic pathways.
