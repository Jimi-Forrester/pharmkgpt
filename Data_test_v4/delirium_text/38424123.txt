38424123|a|Glypicans are biomarkers for various pathologies, including cardiovascular disease, cancer and diabetes. Increasing evidence suggests that glypicans also play a role in the context of neurodegenerative disorders. Initially described as supporting functionality of synapses via glutamate receptors during CNS development, Glypican 4 (GPC-4) also plays a role in the context of dementia via tau hyperphosphorylation in Alzheimer's disease, which is also a co-pathology in Parkinson's disease dementia. However, clinical evidence of circulating GPC-4 in Parkinson's disease (PD) is missing so far. We therefore investigated GPC-4 in biofluids of PD patients. We analyzed GPC-4 levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF, n = 140), serum (n = 80), and tear fluid samples (n = 70) of PD patients and control subjects in a similar age range by ELISA (serum, CSF) and western blot (tear fluid). Expression of circulating GPC-4 was confirmed in all three biofluids, with highest levels in serum. Interestingly, GPC-4 levels were age-dependent, and multiple regression analysis revealed a significant association between GPC-4 serum levels and MoCA score, suggesting an involvement of GPC-4 in PD-associated cognitive decline. Furthermore, stratification of PD patients for vascular risk factors revealed a significant increase of GPC-4 serum levels in PD patients with vascular risk factors. Our results suggest GPC-4 as a clinical biomarker for vascular risk stratification in order to identify PD patients with increased risk of developing dementia.
