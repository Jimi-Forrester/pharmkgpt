37007394|a|Parkinsonism is a rare manifestation of brain tumors that has most commonly been reported in association with gliomas and meningiomas. In this paper, we describe a unique case of secondary Parkinsonism that was precipitated by a craniopharyngioma. A 42-year-old female presented with resting tremors, rigidity, and bradykinesia. Her past medical history was significant for a craniopharyngioma resection four months prior. The postoperative course was complicated by severe delirium, panhypopituitarism, and diabetes insipidus. Notably, she was taking haloperidol and aripiprazole daily for four months to manage her delirium and psychotic episodes. Her preoperative brain MRI showed a compressive effect of the craniopharyngioma on the midbrain and nigrostriatum. Drug-induced Parkinsonism was initially suspected given extended treatment with antipsychotics. Haloperidol and aripiprazole were stopped, and benztropine was started with no improvement. Consequently, the patient was treated with carbidopa/levodopa with symptomatic improvement. A dopamine transporter (DaT) scan was done after starting carbidopa/levodopa and showed asymmetric decreased uptake in dopamine transporter in the striatum. Only one other case of Parkinsonism following craniopharyngioma resection was found in the literature review. Unlike our example, the symptoms resolved following surgical intervention and did not require a long-term treatment with carbidopa/levodopa. The purpose of our case report is to highlight brain tumors as a potential cause of secondary Parkinsonism in younger patients for an early surgical intervention can be curative.
