38791631|t|Retrospective Comparison of the Anesthetic Effects of Tiletamine-Zolazepam with Dexmedetomidine and Ketamine with Dexmedetomidine in Captive Formosan Serow (Capricornis swinhoei).
38791631|a|Formosan serows are endemic to the mountainous regions of Taiwan. This crossover study aimed to assess and compare the anesthetic induction and recovery using either dexmedetomidine-tiletamine-zolazepam (DZ) or dexmedetomidine-ketamine (DK) by intramuscular injection from a blow-dart in a zoo environment. Ten anesthetic procedures were performed with five adult Formosan serows. Each participant was anesthetized with both combinations at least once with a minimal 12-month washout. The average dosages were 22.6 +- 8.3 microg/kg and 35.8 +- 2.5 microg/kg for dexmedetomidine and 185.6 +- 123.6 and 357.8 +- 25.2 microg/kg for atipamezole for the DZ and DK groups, respectively. The doses of tiletamine-zolazepam and ketamine were 2.1 +- 0.25 mg/kg and 3.6 +- 0.3 mg/kg, respectively, in the DZ and DK groups. All participants were induced within 10 min (median: 8 min for both groups), except one serow in the DK group with an induction time of 22 min. Serows in the DZ group had a lower respiratory rate (p = 0.016) and lower rectal temperature (p = 0.008) than those in the DK group. The quality of recovery was poor for DZ because of paddling, prolonged recovery, and ataxia after antagonism of dexmedetomidine with atipamezole. The induction of anesthesia with dexmedetomidine-tiletamine-zolazepam was uneventful and rapid. However, recovery from this combination was not smooth.
