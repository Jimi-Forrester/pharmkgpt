24488394|t|Expenses related to hospital admissions for the elderly in Brazil: perspectives of a decade.
24488394|a|OBJECTIVE: To describe the profile of morbidities and expenses related to hospitalization of the elderly compared to the adult population (20 to 59 years). METHODS: A descriptive, cross-sectional investigation of hospitalizations of the elderly (60 years or older) in Brazil during the period from 2002 to 2011, with data from DATASUS and based on ICD-10. RESULTS: Although the highest number of hospitalizations were in the adult age range, the expenses were greater with the elderly, and in this case especially with mental and behavioral disorders, musculoskeletal and connective tissue diseases, followed by circulatory diseases and external causes. CONCLUSION: The results suggest the adoption of more comprehensive policies and increased investment in health promotion, disease prevention, and appropriate and suitable treatment for the most prevalent diseases in the elderly, particularly in primary care.
