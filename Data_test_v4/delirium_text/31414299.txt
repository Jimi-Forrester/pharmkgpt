31414299|t|Potential Use of Exfoliated and Cultured Olfactory Neuronal Precursors for In Vivo Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis: A Pilot Study.
31414299|a|Histopathological hallmarks of dementia have been described postmortem in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Tau, a microtubule associated protein, is abnormally arranged in neurofibrillary tangles. In living AD patients, total tau (t-tau) and hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau) levels are increased in the cerebrospinal fluid obtained by lumbar puncture. Herein, we studied the t-tau and p-tau levels as well as the subcellular distribution of t-tau in olfactory neuronal precursors obtained by exfoliation of the nasal cavity of AD patients and control participants. Data showed that t-tau and p-tau levels were increased in cell homogenates from AD patients. Also, t-tau immunoreactivity was arranged in a punctate pattern in olfactory neuronal precursors derived from an AD participant with 5 years of evolution and in the oldest participants, either control subjects or those with Alzheimer's disease. Results support that exfoliated neuronal precursors have tau alterations demonstrated in postmortem brain and in the cerebrospinal fluid. This evidence and because the obtainment of olfactory neuronal precursors is a noninvasive procedure, detection of tau alterations shown here might be useful for an early diagnosis of AD-type dementia.
