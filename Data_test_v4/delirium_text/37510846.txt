37510846|a|The purpose of this review was to conduct a comparative assessment of the concepts of therapy for pediatric patients with COVID-19 in the framework of global clinical practice. A structural analysis of the range of drugs and treatment strategies in the context of etiotropic, pathogenetic, and symptomatic therapy has shown that in the global context and in real clinical practice, the etiotropic-pathogenetic approach based on information about the effectiveness of individual medical technologies prevails today. It has been established that eight international nonproprietary/grouping names are present in international practice as means of etiotropic therapy for pediatric patients with COVID-19, and 18 positions are used for pathogenetic therapy. In terms of frequency of occurrence, the leading positions are occupied by remdesivir and the combination of nirmatrelvir with ritonavir, as well as dexamethasone and tocilizumab. The paper emphasizes the relevance of research in the field of evaluating the effectiveness of individual treatment regimens as well as the analysis of the delayed consequences of pathology suffered in childhood under the conditions of using various approaches to pharmacotherapy.
