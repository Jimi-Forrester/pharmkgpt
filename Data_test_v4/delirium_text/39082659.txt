39082659|t|Assessment of Serum Zonulin Levels in Individuals Diagnosed With Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria.
39082659|a|BACKGROUND: There have been reports indicating a correlation between heightened intestinal permeability and many autoimmune and chronic inflammatory disorders. The involvement of autoimmunity is now recognized as a significant factor in the development of chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU). Zonulin is an important biomarker that regulates tight junction permeability within cells in the gastrointestinal tract, hence facilitating intestinal permeability. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the correlation of CSU with intestinal permeability by measuring the serum levels of zonulin in patients diagnosed with CSU. METHODS: The study included 60 patients diagnosed with CSU and 64 age- and sex-matched healthy individuals as controls. Levels of serum zonulin were determined using the ELISA method. RESULTS: Although the serum zonulin value of the patients was higher compared to the controls, the difference did not reach a significant level (24.65+-8.49 ng/ml vs. 21.03+-7.36 ng/ml, p=0.077). The serum zonulin level had a significant correlation with the urticaria activity score in the CSU group (p=0.013). The results of the current study revealed that serum zonulin values significantly differed between patients with CSU and healthy controls. CONCLUSION: This study is important in terms of being the first to investigate the serum zonulin levels in CSU. However, there is a need for further studies with larger patient groups.
