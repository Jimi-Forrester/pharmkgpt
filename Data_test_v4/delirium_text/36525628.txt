36525628|t|The Functional External Memory Aid Tool Version 2.0: A How-To Clinical Guide.
36525628|a|PURPOSE: Although compensatory cognitive rehabilitation is a common treatment approach for adults with cognitive-communication disorders, there are few assessment tools available to support clinicians in developing person-centered treatment plans. In addition to understanding a client's cognitive and functional abilities, it is also important to understand how they compensate for their weaknesses, specifically with external aids (e.g., calendars, notes), in everyday life. The Functional External Memory Aid Tool (FEMAT) is a performance-based measure that quantifies and describes external aid use during task completion. METHOD: The purpose of this clinical focus article is to educate and equip clinicians to administer and interpretate the FEMAT with adult clients with cognitive-communication disorders. This clinical focus article describes the theoretical motivation for the FEMAT as well as the administration, scoring, and interpretation procedures for Version 2.0 of the measure. A hypothetical case example is included to illustrate how to use the FEMAT to develop person-centered goals and treatment plans. CONCLUSIONS: The FEMAT is psychometrically sound, clinically relevant, free, easily accessible, and quick to administer and provides data that are complementary to data obtained from traditional performance-based and/or patient-reported measures. This clinical focus article describes new resources that are available to help clinicians administer and interpret Version 2.0 of the FEMAT when serving adults with cognitive-communication disorders.
