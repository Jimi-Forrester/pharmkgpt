17371907|a|The role of amyloid metabolism in the pathophysiology of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) has yet to be elucidated. We compared CSF levels of amyloid beta 1-40 (Abeta40) and amyloid beta 1-42 (Abeta42) in patients with FTLD (n = 21) versus patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD, n = 39) and in control subjects (n = 30). While in AD cases Abeta42 levels were lower and CSF Abeta40 levels equal to those in controls, a significant decrease in Abeta40 and increase in the CSF Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio was observed in FTLD compared with AD and control subjects. These findings favour a differential involvement of amyloid beta peptides in FTLD compared with AD.
