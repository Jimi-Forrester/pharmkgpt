25451852|a|Fragile X-associated tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is caused by FMR1 premutation. The features include ataxia, action tremor and middle cerebellar peduncle (MCP) hyperintensity, the latter being the only major radiological criterion in the diagnosis of definite FXTAS until very recently. The importance of corpus callosum splenium (CCS) hyperintensity was recently reported and this sign is now considered as an additional major radiological diagnostic criterion in the diagnosis of FXTAS. However, little is known about its relevance for the diagnosis of FXTAS in clinical practice. We report a practical justification of the relevance of CCS hyperintensity in parallel with MCP hyperintensity for the diagnosis of FXTAS. Clinical and radiological study of 22 FMR1 premutation carriers with neurological signs that may be encountered in FXTAS compared to series of patients with essential tremor, multiple system atrophy of cerebellar type, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and stroke. Among the 22 patients with FMR1 premutation [17 men, 5 women; mean age, 63 +- 7.5 (46-84)], 14 were diagnosed with definite FXTAS with the initial criteria. Considering CCS hyperintensity as a new major radiological criterion permitted the diagnosis of definite FXTAS in 3 additional patients. Overall CCS proved as frequent as MCP hyperintensity (64 versus 64 %), while 23 % of patients had CCS but not MCP hyperintensity, 14 % of patients had CCS hyperintensity but neither MCP, nor brainstem hyperintensity. In contrast with CCS hyperintensity, MCP hyperintensity proved less frequent in women than in men. CCS and MCP hyperintensity were more frequent in FXTAS than in the other neurodegenerative disorders. The combination of CCS and MCP hyperintensity was specific of FXTAS. We confirmed the relevance of CCS hyperintensity in FXTAS and we clarified its interest compared to MCP hyperintensity. Our results support the inclusion of CCS hyperintensity in the diagnostic criteria as a new major radiological criterion.
