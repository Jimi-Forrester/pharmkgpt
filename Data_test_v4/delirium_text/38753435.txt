38753435|t|Development of Triphenylmethane Dyes for In Vivo Fluorescence Imaging of Abeta Oligomers.
38753435|a|Detection of amyloid beta (Abeta) oligomers, regarded as the most toxic aggregated forms of Abeta, can contribute to the diagnosis and treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Thus, the development of imaging probes for in vivo visualization of Abeta oligomers is crucial. However, the structural uncertainty regarding Abeta oligomers makes it difficult to design imaging probes with high sensitivity to Abeta oligomers against highly aggregated Abeta fibrils. In this study, we developed Abeta oligomer-selective fluorescent probes based on triphenylmethane dyes through screening of commercially available compounds followed by structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies on cyclic or acyclic 4-dialkylamino groups. We synthesized 11 triarylmethane-based Abeta oligomer probe (TAMAOP) derivatives. In vitro evaluation of fluorescence properties, TAMAOP-9, which had bulky 4-diisobutylamino groups introduced into three benzenes of a twisted triphenylmethane backbone, showed marked fluorescence enhancement in the presence of Abeta oligomers and demonstrated high selectivity for Abeta oligomers against Abeta fibrils. In docking studies using the Abeta trimer model, TAMAOP-9 bound to the hydrophobic surface and interacted with the side chain of Phe20. In vitro section staining revealed that TAMAOP-9 could visualize Abeta oligomers in the brains of AD model mice. An in vivo fluorescence imaging study using TAMAOP-9 showed significantly higher fluorescence signals from the brains of AD model mice than those of age-matched wild-type mice, confirmed by ex vivo section observation. These results suggest that TAMAOP-9 is a promising Abeta oligomer-targeting fluorescent probe applicable to in vivo imaging.
