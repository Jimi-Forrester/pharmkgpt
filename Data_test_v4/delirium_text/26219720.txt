26219720|a|Tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP) is present on neuronal membranes and induces neuronal toxicity via tau dephosphorylation; a mechanism which could play a role in the neuronal loss seen in Alzheimer's disease (AD). TNAP increases in the plasma following brain injury and cerebrovascular disease. In this chapter we summarise our previous work which looked at changes in TNAP activity in the brain and plasma of AD individuals and discuss whether these changes may be reflective of neuronal loss. Our data demonstrate that TNAP activity is significantly increased in the brain in both the sporadic and familial forms of AD and that TNAP activity is significantly increased in the plasma in AD patients. In addition, we describe a significant inverse correlation between plasma TNAP activity and cognitive function in AD. Using these data we propose a model for TNAP-induced neurodegeneration in AD resulting from tau dephosphorylation following secretion of tau from neuronal cells.
