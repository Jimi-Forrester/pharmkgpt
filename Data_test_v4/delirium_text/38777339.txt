38777339|t|Cholecystokinin neurotransmission in the central nervous system: Insights into its role in health and disease.
38777339|a|Cholecystokinin (CCK) plays a key role in various brain functions, including both health and disease states. Despite the extensive research conducted on CCK, there remain several important questions regarding its specific role in the brain. As a result, the existing body of literature on the subject is complex and sometimes conflicting. The primary objective of this review article is to provide a comprehensive overview of recent advancements in understanding the central nervous system role of CCK, with a specific emphasis on elucidating CCK's mechanisms for neuroplasticity, exploring its interactions with other neurotransmitters, and discussing its significant involvement in neurological disorders. Studies demonstrate that CCK mediates both inhibitory long-term potentiation (iLTP) and excitatory long-term potentiation (eLTP) in the brain. Activation of the GPR173 receptor could facilitate iLTP, while the Cholecystokinin B receptor (CCKBR) facilitates eLTP. CCK receptors' expression on different neurons regulates activity, neurotransmitter release, and plasticity, emphasizing CCK's role in modulating brain function. Furthermore, CCK plays a pivotal role in modulating emotional states, Alzheimer's disease, addiction, schizophrenia, and epileptic conditions. Targeting CCK cell types and circuits holds promise as a therapeutic strategy for alleviating these brain disorders.
