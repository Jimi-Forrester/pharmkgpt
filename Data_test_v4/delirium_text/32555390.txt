32555390|t|Recombinant Bri3 BRICHOS domain is a molecular chaperone with effect against amyloid formation and non-fibrillar protein aggregation.
32555390|a|Molecular chaperones assist proteins in achieving a functional structure and prevent them from misfolding into aggregates, including disease-associated deposits. The BRICHOS domain from familial dementia associated protein Bri2 (or ITM2B) probably chaperones its specific proprotein region with high beta-sheet propensity during biosynthesis. Recently, Bri2 BRICHOS activity was found to extend to other amyloidogenic, fibril forming peptides, in particular, Alzheimer's disease associated amyloid-beta peptide, as well as to amorphous aggregate forming proteins. However, the biological functions of the central nervous system specific homologue Bri3 BRICHOS are still to be elucidated. Here we give a detailed characterisation of the recombinant human (rh) Bri3 BRICHOS domain and compare its structural and functional properties with rh Bri2 BRICHOS. The results show that rh Bri3 BRICHOS forms more and larger oligomers, somewhat more efficiently prevents non-fibrillar protein aggregation, and less efficiently reduces Abeta42 fibril formation compared to rh Bri2 BRICHOS. This suggests that Bri2 and Bri3 BRICHOS have overlapping molecular mechanisms and that their apparently different tissue expression and processing may result in different physiological functions.
