35747411|a|Background: Community programs and services dedicated to support those living with dementia and care partners can improve their quality of life. In close collaboration with the Alzheimer Society of British Columbia, we evaluated the First Link  dementia support services, aiming to identify key strengths and areas of improvements to inform the services offered. Methods: A survey instrument was developed and distributed to people living with dementia, care partners, and health-care providers. Results: A total of 1,123 surveys were analyzed. Overall, respondents were satisfied with First Link dementia support services. Key strengths of the program included providing information and education for their clients to learn more about dementia and other resources in the community. Areas for improvement that were identified as part of this evaluation included additional supports for participants' mental health and well-being in terms of reducing stress, burden and isolation. Findings uncovered discrepancies in the way people living with dementia, care partners, and health-care providers view the effectiveness of the First Link dementia support services. Conclusion: An evaluation of programs and services for people living with dementia and their care partners can provide valuable insights about their experiences which can ensure that their needs are addressed.
