37742640|a|BACKGROUND: Limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy neuropathologic change (LATE-NC) is a clinicopathological construct proposed to facilitate studying TDP-43 pathology in older individuals. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to describe clinical and cognitive characteristics of LATE-NC without Alzheimer's disease neuropathologic change (ADNC) and Lewy body (LB) and to compare this with ADNC and primary age related tauopathy (PART). METHODS: In 364 autopsies of the oldest-old of The 90+ Study, we identified those with LATE-NC without ADNC and LB. Control groups were participants with ADNC and PART. RESULTS: Of 31% of participants who had LATE-NC, only 5 (1.4%) had LATE-NC without ADNC and LB, all of whom had tau. These participants had a gradual and progressive cognitive decline. Four (80%) had dementia at death, a rate that was higher than ADNC (50%) and PART (21.7%). Mean duration of cognitive impairment was twice as long in LATE-NC without ADNC and LB (6.2 years) compared to ADNC (2.9 years) and PART (3 years). LATE-NC without ADNC and LB group had a higher prevalence of syncope, depression, and extrapyramidal signs than the ADNC and PART groups. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the high prevalence of LATE-NC, LATE-NC without ADNC and LB was rare in this large oldest-old cohort, highlighting the very high prevalence of multiple pathologic changes in the oldest old. Slowly progressive cognitive decline, ubiquitous memory impairment, history of syncope and depression, and extrapyramidal signs were prominent features among our LATE-NC without ADNC and LB group.
