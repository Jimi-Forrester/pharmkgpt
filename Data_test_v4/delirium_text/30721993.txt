30721993|t|Pellagra and Alcohol Dependence Syndrome: Findings From a Tertiary Care Addiction Treatment Centre in India.
30721993|a|AIM: To define the prevalence and clinical presentation of pellagra, a multi-systemic disease caused by the deficiency of niacin, in patients admitted to a tertiary addiction treatment centre in southern India, with alcohol dependence syndrome (ADS)-(ICD10). METHODS: Review of the health records of 2947 patients who received inpatient care for ADS between 2015 and 2017. RESULTS: Out of 2947, 31 (1%) were diagnosed with pellagra. Nearly two-thirds (64.5%) of those with pellagra were from a low-income group. Of the clinical-triad of pellagra, all patients had dermatitis, more than half (58%) had delirium, a minority (19%) had diarrhoea. Nearly two-thirds (61%) had presented in a complicated-withdrawal state. Associated conditions included peripheral neuropathy (32%); Wernicke's encephalopathy (26%); seizures (16%).Seventeen (54%) had BMI <18.5 kg/m2. Treatment was a high dose of parenteral vitamins including niacin (mean dose: 1500 mg/day) for an average of 7.5 days followed by oral multivitamin supplements. All had complete resolution of pellagrous symptoms by the end of the three weeks of inpatient care. CONCLUSIONS: Pellagra is an acute medical condition, frequently encountered in the context of alcohol dependence and poverty. It often presents with other disabling and life-threatening comorbidities like delirium tremens and Wernicke's encephalopathy. The classical triad of pellagra is only seen in a minority of cases. Thus a high index of suspicion is required lest pellagra may remain undiagnosed. Prompt identification and treatment with a high dose of niacin in combination with other vitamins result in complete recovery.
