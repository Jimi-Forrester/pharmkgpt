34505762|t|Abeta31-35 Decreases Neprilysin-Mediated Alzheimer's Amyloid-beta Peptide Degradation.
34505762|a|Alzheimer's disease is associated with the deposition of extracellular senile plaques, made primarily of amyloid-beta (Abeta), particularly peptides Abeta1-42 and Abeta1-40. Neprilysin, or neutral endopeptidase (NEP), catalyzes proteolysis of the amyloid peptides (Abeta) and is recognized as one of the major regulators of the levels of these peptides in the brain, preventing Abeta accumulation and plaque formation. Here, we used a combination of techniques to elucidate the mechanism of Abeta binding and cleavage by NEP. Our findings indicate that the Abeta31-X cleavage products remain bound to the neprilysin active site, reducing proteolytic activity. Interestingly, it was already shown that this Abeta31-35 sequence is also critical for recognition of Abeta peptides by other targets, such as the serpin-enzyme complex receptor in neuronal cells.
