38393535|a|The long COVID (coronavirus disease), a multisystemic condition following severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, is one of the widespread problems. Some of its symptoms affect the nervous system and resemble symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD)-a neurodegenerative condition caused by the accumulation of amyloid beta and hyperphosphorylation of tau proteins. Multiple studies have found dependence between these two conditions. Patients with Alzheimer's disease have a greater risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection due to increased levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and the infection itself promotes amyloid beta generation which enhances the risk of AD. Also, the molecular pathways are alike-misregulations in folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism, a deficit of Cq10, and disease-associated microglia. Medical imaging in both of these diseases shows a decrease in the volume of gray matter, global brain size reduction, and hypometabolism in the parahippocampal gyrus, thalamus, and cingulate cortex. In some studies, a similar approach to applied medication can be seen, including the use of amino adamantanes and phenolic compounds of rosemary. The significance of these connections and their possible application in medical practice still needs further study but there is a possibility that they will help to better understand long COVID.
