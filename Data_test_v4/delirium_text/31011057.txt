31011057|t|One-Year Mortality Rates Before and After Implementing Quality-Improvement Initiatives to Prevent Inpatient Falls (2012-2016).
31011057|a|Single-room ward design has previously been associated with increased risk of inpatient falls and adverse outcomes. However, following quality initiatives, the incidence of inpatient falls has shown a sustained reduction. Benefits have also been observed in the reduction of hip fractures. However, one-year mortality trends have not been reported. The aim of this observational study is to report the trends in one-year mortality rates before and after implementing quality-improvement initiatives to prevent inpatient falls over the last 5 years (2012-2016). This retrospective observational study was conducted for all patients who had sustained an inpatient fall between January 2012 and December 2016. All the incident reports in DATIX patient-safety software which were completed for each inpatient fall were studied, and the clinical information was extracted from Clinical Work Station software. Mortality data were collected on all patients for a minimum of one year following the discharge from the hospital. The results show that 95% patients were admitted from their own homes; 1704 patients had experienced 3408 incidents of an inpatient fall over 5 years. The mean age of females (82.61 +- 10.34 years) was significantly higher than males (79.36 +- 10.14 years). Mean falls/patient = 2.0 +- 2.16, range 1-33). Mean hospital stay was 45.43 +- 41.42 days. Mean hospital stay to the first fall was 14.5 +- 20.79 days, and mean days to first fall prior to discharge was 30.8 +- 34.33 days. The results showed a significant and sustained reduction in the incidence of inpatient falls. There was a downward trend in the incidence of hip fractures over the last two years. There was no significant difference in the inpatient and 30-day mortality rate over the last five years. However, mortality trends appear to show a significant downward trend in both six-month and one-year mortality rates over the last two years following the implementation of quality initiatives to prevent inpatient falls. A significant reduction in the incidence of inpatient falls following quality initiatives initially has been observed, followed by a downward trend in the incidence of hip fractures. We have just started to observe a significant reduction in the 6-month and one-year mortality. We propose prompt completion of multifactorial falls risk assessments, and every possible quality initiative should be taken to prevent a 'first inpatient fall', which should result in the sustained improvement of clinical outcomes.
