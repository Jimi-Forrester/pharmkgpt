25134526|a|BACKGROUND: Neuroinflammation mediated by overactivated microglia plays a key role in many neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, we investigated for the first time the anti-neuroinflammatory effects and possible mechanisms of SCM-198 (an alkaloid extracted from Herbaleonuri), which was previously found highly cardioprotective, both in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: For in vitro experiments, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or beta-amyloid(1-40) (Abeta(1-40)) was applied to induce microglial overactivation. Proinflammatory mediators were measured and activations of NF-kappaB and mitogen-activated protein kinases' (MAPKs) pathways were investigated. Further protective effect of SCM-198 was evaluated in microglia-neuron co-culture assay and Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats intrahippocampally-injected with Abeta(1-40). RESULTS: SCM-198 reduced expressions of nitric oxide (NO), TNF-alpha, IL-1beta and IL-6 possibly via, at least partially, inhibiting c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and NF-kappaB signaling pathways in microglia. Co-culture assay showed that activated microglia pretreated with SCM-198 led to less neuron loss and decreased phosphorylation of tau and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in neurons. Besides, SCM-198 also directly protected against Abeta(1-40)-induced neuronal death and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release in primary cortical neurons. For in vivo studies, SCM-198 significantly enhanced cognitive performances of rats 12 days after intrahippocampal injections of aged Abeta(1-40) peptides in the Morris water maze (MWM), accompanied by less hippocampal microglial activation, decreased synaptophysin loss and phosphorylation of ERK and tau. Co-administration of donepezil and SCM-198 resulted in a slight cognitive improvement in SD rats 50 days after intrahippocampal injections of aged Abeta(1-40) peptides as compared to only donepezil or SCM-198 treated group. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings are the first to report that SCM-198 has considerable anti-neuroinflammatory effects on inhibiting microglial overactivation and might become a new potential drug candidate for AD therapy in the future.
