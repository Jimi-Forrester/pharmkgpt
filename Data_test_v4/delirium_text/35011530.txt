35011530|t|Alternative Targets for Modulators of Mitochondrial Potassium Channels.
35011530|a|Mitochondrial potassium channels control potassium influx into the mitochondrial matrix and thus regulate mitochondrial membrane potential, volume, respiration, and synthesis of reactive oxygen species (ROS). It has been found that pharmacological activation of mitochondrial potassium channels during ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury activates cytoprotective mechanisms resulting in increased cell survival. In cancer cells, the inhibition of these channels leads to increased cell death. Therefore, mitochondrial potassium channels are intriguing targets for the development of new pharmacological strategies. In most cases, however, the substances that modulate the mitochondrial potassium channels have a few alternative targets in the cell. This may result in unexpected or unwanted effects induced by these compounds. In our review, we briefly present the various classes of mitochondrial potassium (mitoK) channels and describe the chemical compounds that modulate their activity. We also describe examples of the multidirectional activity of the activators and inhibitors of mitochondrial potassium channels.
