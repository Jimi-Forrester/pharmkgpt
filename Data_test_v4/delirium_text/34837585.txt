34837585|t|Opal: an implementation science tool for machine learning clinical decision support in anesthesia.
34837585|a|Opal is the first published example of a full-stack platform infrastructure for an implementation science designed for ML in anesthesia that solves the problem of leveraging ML for clinical decision support. Users interact with a secure online Opal web application to select a desired operating room (OR) case cohort for data extraction, visualize datasets with built-in graphing techniques, and run in-client ML or extract data for external use. Opal was used to obtain data from 29,004 unique OR cases from a single academic institution for pre-operative prediction of post-operative acute kidney injury (AKI) based on creatinine KDIGO criteria using predictors which included pre-operative demographic, past medical history, medications, and flowsheet information. To demonstrate utility with unsupervised learning, Opal was also used to extract intra-operative flowsheet data from 2995 unique OR cases and patients were clustered using PCA analysis and k-means clustering. A gradient boosting machine model was developed using an 80/20 train to test ratio and yielded an area under the receiver operating curve (ROC-AUC) of 0.85 with 95% CI [0.80-0.90]. At the default probability decision threshold of 0.5, the model sensitivity was 0.9 and the specificity was 0.8. K-means clustering was performed to partition the cases into two clusters and for hypothesis generation of potential groups of outcomes related to intraoperative vitals. Opal's design has created streamlined ML functionality for researchers and clinicians in the perioperative setting and opens the door for many future clinical applications, including data mining, clinical simulation, high-frequency prediction, and quality improvement.
