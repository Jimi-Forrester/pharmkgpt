29209328|t|Antibodies against MYC-Associated Zinc Finger Protein: An Independent Marker in Acute Coronary Syndrome?
29209328|a|INTRODUCTION: Atherosclerosis is considered the pathophysiology underlying cardiovascular (CVD), cerebrovascular, and peripheral vascular diseases. Evidence supporting an autoimmune component is emerging, with imaging studies correlating MYC-associated zinc finger protein antibody (MAZ-Ab) optical density (OD) with plaque activity. This study compares MAZ-Ab OD on ELISA testing among patients presenting with acute coronary syndromes (ACSs) to healthy controls and investigates the association of MAZ-Ab to traditional CVD risk factors. METHODS: Patients admitted with ACSs between August 2007 and July 2011 were included. Serum samples taken at presentation were retrospectively tested for MAZ-Ab and compared with serum from healthy volunteers with no CVD risk factors. Large-scale assessment of post-ACS prognostic relevance was performed using the established PLATO cohort. RESULTS: In total 174 ACS patients and 96 controls were included. Among ACS patients, median MAZ-Ab OD was higher compared with controls (0.46 vs. 0.27; p = 0.001). Although the majority of ACS patients (116/174; 67%) had suffered from a ST-elevation myocardial infarction, no significant differences in MAZ-Ab titers were evident between ACS subtypes (p = 0.682). No associations between MAZ-Ab OD and conventional CVD risk factors were identified. Large-scale testing revealed no prognostic stratification regarding reinfarction (OR 1.04 [95% CI: 0.94-1.16]; p = 0.436). CONCLUSION: MAZ-Ab OD was higher or all ACS phenotypes compared with controls. Given current understanding of MAZ-Ab function, these findings support an autoimmune component to CVD independent of conventional risk factors and indeed the extent of end-organ damage.
