24741728|t|Dexmedetomidine for Sedation of Patients in the ICU or PICU: Review of Clinical Effectiveness and Safety
24741728|a|Sedation of ICU patients is often essential for ICU patients to maximize survival, reduce ICU and hospital stay, and facilitate mechanical ventilation. The standard of care for sedation include benzodiazepine sedatives and propofol. Some drawbacks of the available sedative agents include patients  agitation and delirium. To overcome these drawbacks, it has been suggested that dexmedetomidine can be an appropriate alternative to traditional sedatives for maintaining light to moderate sedation. However, the Health Canada approved label for dexmedetomidine provides warnings that the drug is associated with hypotension, clinically significant episodes of bradycardia, and sinus arrest. The objective of the current review is to evaluate the evidence surrounding the use of dexmedetomidine for sedation in intensive-care units.
