37211307|t|Platelets and Hemostatic Proteins are Co-Localized with Chronic Neuroinflammation Surrounding Implanted Intracortical Microelectrodes.
37211307|a|Intracortical microelectrodes induce vascular injury upon insertion into the cortex. As blood vessels rupture, blood proteins and blood-derived cells (including platelets) are introduced into the 'immune privileged' brain tissues at higher-than-normal levels, passing through the damaged blood-brain barrier. Blood proteins adhere to implant surfaces, increasing the likelihood of cellular recognition leading to activation of immune and inflammatory cells. Persistent neuroinflammation is a major contributing factor to declining microelectrode recording performance. We investigated the spatial and temporal relationship of blood proteins fibrinogen and von Willebrand Factor (vWF), platelets, and type IV collagen, in relation to glial scarring markers for microglia and astrocytes following implantation of non-functional multi-shank silicon microelectrode probes into rats. Together with type IV collagen, fibrinogen and vWF augment platelet recruitment, activation, and aggregation. Our main results indicate blood proteins participating in hemostasis (fibrinogen and vWF) persisted at the microelectrode interface for up to 8-weeks after implantation. Further, type IV collagen and platelets surrounded the probe interface with similar spatial and temporal trends as vWF and fibrinogen. In addition to prolonged blood-brain barrier instability, specific blood and extracellular matrix proteins may play a role in promoting the inflammatory activation of platelets and recruitment to the microelectrode interface. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Implanted microelectrodes have substantial potential for restoring function to people with paralysis and amputation by providing signals that feed into natural control algorithms that drive prosthetic devices. Unfortunately, these microelectrodes do not display robust performance over time. Persistent neuroinflammation is widely thought to be a primary contributor to the devices' progressive decline in performance. Our manuscript reports on the highly local and persistent accumulation of platelets and hemostatic blood proteins around the microelectrode interface of brain implants. To our knowledge neuroinflammation driven by cellular and non-cellular responses associated with hemostasis and coagulation has not been rigorously quantified elsewhere. Our findings identify potential targets for therapeutic intervention and a better understanding of the driving mechanisms to neuroinflammation in the brain.
