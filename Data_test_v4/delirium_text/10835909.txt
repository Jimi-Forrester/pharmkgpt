10835909|a|The assessment of some aspects of cardiovascular and sudomotor system was performed in the group of patients with Alzheimer's disease. No one of patients complained of disturbances arising from these two parts of the vegetative system. The autonomic functions were evaluated by means of: clinical examination, heart rate variability tests at rest, measures of blood pressure and heart rate in supine and standing position and skin sympathetic response. At rest heart rate and its variability as well as blood pressure in the patients did not differ significantly from the results obtained in the healthy controls. On standing, changes in systolic blood pressure and heart rate were recorded in the controls, but not found in the patients. The majority of patients presented with abnormalities in skin sympathetic response: lack of response or prolongation of its latency. The results of motor and sensory nerve conduction studies excluded neuropathic changes in the patients. We conclude that autonomic disturbances accompanied Alzheimer's disease and were probably caused by damaged control mechanisms within the central vegetative system.
