28356923|a|Hospital in the home is a relatively new concept within the UK healthcare system. The Guy's and St Thomas's NHS Foundation Trust (GSTT) @home service 'Bringing hospital care to your home' was commissioned by Lambeth and Southwark CCG in 2014 to provide acute care in the patients' place of residence by facilitating rapid discharge from hospital. The service is designed for 260-280 referrals each month from local hospitals, London Ambulance Service, GPs, district nurses and palliative care services. The GSTT@home provides intensive care for a short episode through multidisciplinary team work with the aim of returning the patient to their prior health status following an acute episode of ill health. The main criteria for referrals are adults, living within Lambeth or Southwark with an acute onset of illness often with acute exacerbations of chronic conditions. Care is delivered using 25 clinical pathways using integrated care teams, including those for respiratory disease, heart failure and palliative care services. Recently, the service extended to include overnight palliative care. As care shifts from hospital to the community, it is envisaged that these types of programmes will become an essential component of care provision. This paper describes the service and presents initial service evaluation data.
