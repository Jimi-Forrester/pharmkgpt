32743238|t|The Australian Aged Care and Its Implications for the Korean Aging Crisis.
32743238|a|The Australian aged care system has evolved for >50 years to support frail older adults and allow them to make informed decisions about their care. Hospitals provide streamlined geriatric services from visits at the Emergency Department to discharges from acute and subacute geriatric care units. Moreover, nonhospital aged care services, including Transition Care Program, Commonwealth Home Support Program, Home Care Packages Program, and Residential Care (nursing home) are provided under the auspices of the Australian Government. These various specialized hospital and nonhospital services are integrated and coordinated by the multidisciplinary assessment team called ACAT (Aged Care Assessment Team). Korea does not have a similar amount of time to prepare a well-organized aged care system because of a rapidly increasing older population. The Korean government and aged care experts should exert vigorous efforts to improve the last journeys of the Korean older population.
