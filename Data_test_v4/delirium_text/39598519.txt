39598519|t|Targeted Magnetic Nanoparticles for Beta-Amyloid Detection.
39598519|a|Background/Objectivities: The presence of beta-amyloid plaques is a part of the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, but there is currently no universally accepted method for magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the disease. However, it is known that magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) can improve the T2 contrast in MR images of various targets. Methods: We used cubic MNPs, which were produced by thermal decomposition and then it was covalently bonded to a modified fluorescently labeled tetrapeptide, HAEE-Cy5, for visualizing beta-amyloid plaques. The interaction of MNPs-HAEE-Cy5 and beta-amyloid was determinate by confocal microscopy using SH-SY5Y cell line. Results: MNPs exhibit relatively high relaxivity (approximately 200 mM-1s-1), which is crucial for enhancing target visibility in MR imaging. HAEE provides targeted delivery of MNPs by specifically interacting with beta-amyloid, while the fluorescent label Cy5 enables monitoring the efficacy of the interaction through confocal microscopy. Conclusions: The MNPs modified with HAEE-Cy5 demonstrated excellent binding to beta-amyloid plaques in vitro, as shown by experiments on the SH-SY5Y cell line. These results suggest that the proposed method has potential for use in future MR imaging studies of Alzheimer's disease.
