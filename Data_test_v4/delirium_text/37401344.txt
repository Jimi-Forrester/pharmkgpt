37401344|a|Unnatural helical peptidic foldamers have attracted considerable attention owing to their unique folding behaviours, diverse artificial protein binding mechanisms, and promising applications in chemical, biological, medical, and material fields. Unlike the conventional alpha-helix consisting of molecular entities of native alpha-amino acids, unnatural helical peptidic foldamers are generally comprised of well-defined backbone conformers with unique and unnatural structural parameters. Their folded structures usually arise from unnatural amino acids such as N-substituted glycine, N-substituted-beta-alanine, beta-amino acid, urea, thiourea, alpha-aminoxy acid, alpha-aminoisobutyric acid, aza-amino acid, aromatic amide, gamma-amino acid, as well as sulfono-gamma-AA amino acid. They can exhibit intriguing and predictable three-dimensional helical structures, generally featuring superior resistance to proteolytic degradation, enhanced bioavailability, and improved chemodiversity, and are promising in mimicking helical segments of various proteins. Although it is impossible to include every piece of research work, we attempt to highlight the research progress in the past 10 years in exploring unnatural peptidic foldamers as protein helical segment mimics, by giving some representative examples and discussing the current challenges and future perspectives. We expect that this review will help elucidate the principles of structural design and applications of existing unnatural helical peptidic foldamers in protein segment mimicry, thereby attracting more researchers to explore and generate novel unnatural peptidic foldamers with unique structural and functional properties, leading to more unprecedented and practical applications.
