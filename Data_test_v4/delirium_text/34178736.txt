34178736|a|BACKGROUND: The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Disease 2019 (SARS-CoV-2) severely affects those above the age of 60 yr and those with other conditions. This study aimed to review the available evidence on older adult's issues in facing the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The framework is based on scoping review of literature published from Jan 10 to Jul 31, 2020. Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases and other sources of information, to identify grey literature, were selected for data collection. Two researchers independently screened all studies and extracted data. All types of studies published about SARS-CoV-2 and related to older adults' issues were eligible. RESULTS: Overall, 210 documents were included in the final analysis. Letter to the editor was the most frequent article format (20.95%). Most of the papers were from the United States (38.09%) and published in Jun 2020 (29.52%). After content analysis, six following themes were extracted: Supporting and information sources, e-health services, access to essential supplies, Long Term Care Facilities (LTCFs), physical and mental consequences of self-isolation, neglect of older adults, ageism and age discrimination. CONCLUSION: In the pandemic, there is an urgent need for interventional research and innovational implementations to address issues related to providing services for older adults. This can help older adults to maintain their physical and mental health, and reduce the spread of infection in nursing homes. Further studies focusing on the rights of the older adults are needed on all issues associated with COVID-19.
