28387732|t|Bioactive Metabolites from the Deep Subseafloor Fungus Oidiodendron griseum UBOCC-A-114129.
28387732|a|Four bioactive compounds have been isolated from the fungus Oidiodendron griseum UBOCC-A-114129 cultivated from deep subsurface sediment. They were structurally characterized using a combination of LC-MS/MS and NMR analyses as fuscin and its derivatives (dihydrofuscin, dihydrosecofuscin, and secofuscin) and identified as polyketides. Albeit those compounds were already obtained from terrestrial fungi, this is the first report of their production by an Oidiodendron species and by the deepest subseafloor isolate ever studied for biological activities. We report a weak antibacterial activity of dihydrosecofuscin and secofuscin mainly directed against Gram-positive bacteria (Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) equal to Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC), in the range of 100 mug/mL). The activity on various protein kinases was also analyzed and revealed a significant inhibition of CDC2-like kinase-1 (CLK1) by dihysecofuscin.
