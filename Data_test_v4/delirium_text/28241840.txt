28241840|a|BACKGROUND: Reduction or inhibition of histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) has been shown to rescue memory in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and is recently being considered a possible therapeutic strategy. However, the restoring mechanism of HDAC6 inhibition has not been fully understood. METHODS AND RESULTS: Here, we found that an anti-oxidant protein Peroxdiredoxin1 (Prx1), a substrate of HDAC6, malfunctions in Abeta treated cells, the brains of 5xFAD AD model mice and AD patients. Malfunctioning Prx1, caused by reduced Prx1 acetylation levels, was recovered by HDAC6 inhibition. Increasing acetylation levels of Prx1 by HDAC6 inhibition recovered elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, elevated Ca2+ levels and impaired mitochondrial axonal transport, sequentially, even in the presence of Abeta. Prx1 mutant studies on the K197 site for an acetylation mimic or silencing mutation support the results showing that HDAC6 inhibitor restores Abeta-induced disruption of ROS, Ca2+ and axonal transport. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, increasing acetylation of Prx1 by HDAC6 inhibition has several beneficial effects in AD pathology. Here, we present the novel mechanism by which elevated acetylation of Prx1 rescues mitochondrial axonal transport impaired by Abeta. Therefore, our results suggest that modulation of Prx1 acetylation by HDAC6 inhibition has great therapeutic potential for AD and has further therapeutic possibilities for other neurodegenerative diseases as well.
