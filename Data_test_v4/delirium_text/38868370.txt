38868370|t|Clinical presentation and outcome of enteric fever in adult patients with cancer: a perspective from Pakistan.
38868370|a|Introduction. Enteric fever is a significant health concern in endemic countries. While extensive research has been conducted to understand its presentation and outcomes in non-cancer patients, limited data exist on its impact on cancer patients. This descriptive study aims to investigate the clinical presentation and outcome in cancer patients. Methodology. This retrospective observational study analysed 90 adult cancer patients from a single centre in Pakistan from January 2017 to December 2022. Inclusion criteria involved documented blood culture infections with Salmonella typhi or paratyphi A, B, or C. We examined clinical presentation, laboratory parameters, antimicrobial resistance, complications, and outcomes. Additionally, we explored the effects of chemotherapy, comorbidities, type of malignancy, and patient age on complications and mortality. Results. Salmonella typhi was the most prevalent organism (72.2 %), followed by Salmonella paratyphi A (22.2 %) and B (5.5 %). Variably-resistant isolates constituted 51.5 %, multi-drug resistant (MDR) isolates accounted for 20 %, extensively drug-resistant (XDR) for 14.4 % and ESBL-producers for 15.5 %, of all enteric fever infections. Enteric fever-associated complications were observed in 21.1 % of cases. Chemotherapy in the preceding month did not affect mortality, nor did age, gender, or malignancy type. However, comorbidities were statistically significant for mortality (p-value 0.03). A total of 8.8 % of patients required ICU care, and the all-cause 30 day mortality rate was 13.3 % Conclusion. Enteric fever remains prevalent in our geographical region. Unlike non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS), enteric fever does not behave differently in an immunocompromised population, including cancer patients.
