37603281|t|Therapeutics of Extracellular Vesicles in Cardiocerebrovascular and Metabolic Diseases.
37603281|a|Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are nanoscale membranous vesicles containing DNA, RNA, lipids, and proteins, which play versatile roles in intercellular communications. EVs are increasingly being recognized as the promising therapeutic agents for many diseases, including cardiocerebrovascular and metabolic diseases, due to their ability to deliver functional and therapeutical molecules. In this chapter, the biological characteristics and functions of EVs are briefly summarized. Importantly, the current state of applying EVs in the prevention and treatment of cardiocerebrovascular and metabolic diseases, including myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, myocardial hypertrophy, stroke, diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, fatty liver, obesity, thyroid diseases, and osteoporosis, is discussed. Lastly, the challenges and prospects related to the preclinical and clinical application of EVs receive a particular focus.
