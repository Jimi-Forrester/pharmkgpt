37927268|t|Montreal Cognitive Assessment in Mild Cognitive Impairment: Relationship with Cerebrospinal Fluid Biomarkers and Conversion to Dementia.
37927268|a|BACKGROUND: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is considered a prodromal state of dementia. Abnormal values of cerebrospinal fluid Alzheimer's disease biomarkers (CSF-AD-b) have been associated with a higher risk of conversion to dementia (due to Alzheimer's disease), but studies evaluating the ability of Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) in this task are lacking. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the relationship between MoCA and CSF-AD-b, as well as the ability of those tools to predict conversion to dementia. METHODS: Taking advantage of our MCI cohort with biological characterization on longitudinal follow-up (180 patients followed for 62.6 months during which 41.3% converted), we computed MoCA and MMSE z-scores, using Portuguese normative data. The performance in MoCA z-score was correlated with CSF-AD-b and the relative time to conversion and risk according to baseline characteristics were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox regression models. RESULTS: MoCA z-scores were correlated with Abeta42 (p = 0.026), t-tau (p = 0.033), and p-tau (p = 0.01). Impaired MMSE (p < 0.001) and MoCA z-scores (p = 0.019), decreased Abeta42 (p < 0.001) and increased t-tau (p < 0.001) and p-tau (p < 0.001) were associated with shorter estimated time of conversion. Abeta42 (p < 0.001) and MMSE z-scores (p = 0.029) were independent predictors of conversion. For those with at least 9 years of education, MoCA z-score (p = 0.004) (but not MMSE) was an independent predictor of conversion as well as Abeta42. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the role of CSF-AD-b, namely Abeta42, in predicting conversion from MCI to dementia and suggests the utility of MoCA in predicting conversion in highly educated subjects, supporting its use in the evaluation of MCI patients.
