34681938|t|Investigating Pathogenetic Mechanisms of Alzheimer's Disease by Systems Biology Approaches for Drug Discovery.
34681938|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, characterized by progressive cognitive decline and neurodegenerative disorder. Abnormal aggregations of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and unusual accumulations of extracellular amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides are two important pathological features in AD brains. However, in spite of large-scale clinical studies and computational simulations, the molecular mechanisms of AD development and progression are still unclear. In this study, we divided all of the samples into two groups: early stage (Braak score I-III) and later stage (Braak score IV-VI). By big database mining, the candidate genetic and epigenetic networks (GEN) have been constructed. In order to find out the real GENs for two stages of AD, we performed systems identification and system order detection scheme to prune false positives with the help of corresponding microarray data. Applying the principal network projection (PNP) method, core GENs were extracted from real GENs based on the projection values. By the annotation of KEGG pathway, we could obtain core pathways from core GENs and investigate pathogenetic mechanisms for the early and later stage of AD, respectively. Consequently, according to pathogenetic mechanisms, several potential biomarkers are identified as drug targets for multiple-molecule drug design in the treatment of AD.
