37721286|a|Aging is a natural phenomenon characterized by a progressive decline in physiological integrity, leading to a deterioration of cognitive function and increasing the risk of suffering from chronic-degenerative diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, osteoporosis, cancer, diabetes, and neurodegeneration. Aging is considered the major risk factor for Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease develops. Likewise, diabetes and insulin resistance constitute additional risk factors for developing neurodegenerative disorders. Currently, no treatment can effectively reverse these neurodegenerative pathologies. However, some antidiabetic drugs have opened the possibility of being used against neurodegenerative processes. In the previous framework, Vanadium species have demonstrated a notable antidiabetic effect. Our research group evaluated polyoxidovanadates such as decavanadate and metforminium-decavanadate with preventive and corrective activity on neurodegeneration in brain-specific areas from rats with metabolic syndrome. The results suggest that these polyoxidovanadates induce neuronal and cognitive restoration mechanisms. This review aims to describe the therapeutic potential of polyoxidovanadates as insulin-enhancer agents in the brain, constituting a therapeutic alternative for aging and neurodegenerative diseases.
