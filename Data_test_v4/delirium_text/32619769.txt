32619769|a|BACKGROUND: Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) facilitate the provision of standardized, high-quality intensive care medicine. For the management of pain, agitation and delirium, several coexisting CPGs have been published. This study aims at the appraisal of CPGs on pain, agitation and delirium management in the intensive care unit to (a) identify high quality guidelines appropriate for clinical use and (b) identify potential areas for future improvement. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search of Medline, three guideline registers and two grey-literature databases. The scope covered guidelines from 2007 to 2020 available in English or German. Identified CPGs were appraised by three independent reviewers using the appraisal of Guidelines Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) instrument. RESULTS: Eight CPGs were included in the final analysis. Three of the included guidelines exceeded the quality threshold of 60% in all six domains. The highest median [IQR] scores were achieved in the domain "Scope and Purpose" (84.3% [78.7-88.9]), whereas "Applicability" (45.8% [19.4-79.9]) received the lowest median score. CONCLUSION: Three of the eight reviewed guidelines exceeded the quality threshold in all domains, while the overall guideline quality was also very high. Focusing on guideline applicability and identifying strategies to facilitate implementation can improve future CPGs.
