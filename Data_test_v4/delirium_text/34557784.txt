34557784|t|Associations of particulate matter with dementia and mild cognitive impairment in China: A multicenter cross-sectional study.
34557784|a|Ambient air pollution has been shown to be associated with the pathogenesis of dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). However, few studies have examined these associations in well-characterized populations with low residential mobility, similar living habits, and a standardized assessment of both air pollution exposure and clinical outcome. This study examined the associations of long-term exposure to particulate matter (PM) air pollution with dementia and MCI, using data from the Chinese Veteran Clinical Research Platform. The cognitive function of elderly veterans from 277 communities in 18 Chinese cities was examined. Participants' daily exposures to aerodynamic diameters <=2.5 mum (PM2.5) and <=10 mum (PM10) during the 3 years prior to the survey were estimated using a satellite-based prediction. The adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals of MCI associated with each 10 mug/m3 increase in PM2.5 and PM10 were 1.52 (1.39, 1.67) and 1.04 (1.00, 1.08), and those of dementia associated with PM2.5 and PM10 were 1.27 (1.11, 1.46) and 1.13 (1.05, 1.21), respectively. This demonstrates that long-term exposure to PM2.5 and PM10 can increase the prevalence of dementia/MCI among veterans in China. Higher ORs were observed for those with <=9 years of educational attainment, those who actively attended physical activities, those who never smoked, former drinkers, and those who did not suffer from cerebral infarction. Improvement of ambient air quality, especially decreasing levels of PM2.5, may help to decrease the risk of dementia/MCI. Given the statistically significant association between PM and cognitive impairment demonstrated here, future studies should focus on examining the causal effect of PM pollution on dementia and MCI.
