6692281|a|The author discusses the prevalence of psychiatric problems in cancer, and highlights five emotional problems common to all cancer patients: the emotionally charged nature of the word cancer, the patient's perceived lack of control, the uncertainty about outcome, the discordant treatment mode, and the debilitating nature of cancer treatments. The author then divides the problems faced by breast cancer patients into three categories needing clinical intervention: (1) the psychosocial, (2) the somatic, and (3) the psychiatric. Diagnosis and treatment of the two psychiatric problems of depression and delirium is emphasized.
