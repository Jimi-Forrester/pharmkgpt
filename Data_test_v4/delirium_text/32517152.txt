32517152|a|Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) are used for treating EGFR-mutated lung cancer, and osimertinib is effective in cases that acquired T790M mutations after treatment with the first- and second-generation EGFR-TKIs. However, no study has evaluated its safety and efficacy in older patients. This phase II trial (jRCTs071180002) evaluated osimertinib in T790M mutation-positive Japanese patients who were >=75 years old and had experienced relapse or progression after previous EGFR-TKI treatment. Our previous report that enrolled 36 patients showed the overall response rate (58.3%) and disease control rate (97.2%), while this report describes the results for the progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety analyses. The median PFS was 11.9 months (95% confidence interval (CI): 7.9-17.5), and the median OS was 22.0 months (95% CI: 16.0 months-not reached). The most frequent adverse events were anemia/hypoalbuminemia (27 patients, 75.0%), thrombocytopenia (21 patients, 58.3%), and paronychia/anorexia/diarrhea/neutropenia (15 patients, 41.7%). Pneumonitis was observed in four patients (11.1%), including two patients (5.6%) with Grade 3-4 pneumonitis. These results suggest that osimertinib was relatively safe and effective for non-small cell lung cancer that acquired T790M mutations after previous EGFR-TKI treatment, even among patients who were >=75 years old.
