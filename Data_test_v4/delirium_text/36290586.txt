36290586|t|Effect of Unloaded and Curcumin-Loaded Solid Lipid Nanoparticles on Tissue Transglutaminase Isoforms Expression Levels in an Experimental Model of Alzheimer's Disease.
36290586|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease representing the most prevalent cause of dementia. It is also related to the aberrant amyloid-beta (Abeta) protein deposition in the brain. Since oxidative stress is involved in AD, there is a possible role of antioxidants present in the effected person's diet. Thus, we assessed the effect of the systemic administration of solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) to facilitate curcumin (CUR) delivery on TG2 isoform expression levels in Wild Type (WT) and in TgCRND8 (Tg) mice. An experimental model of AD, which expresses two mutated human amyloid precursor protein (APP) genes, was used. Behavioral studies were also performed to evaluate the improvement of cognitive performance and memory function induced by all treatments. The expression levels of Bcl-2, Cyclin-D1, and caspase-3 cleavage were evaluated as well. In this research, for the first time, we demonstrated that the systemic administration of SLNs-CUR, both in WT and in Tg mice, allows one to differently modulate TG2 isoforms, which act either on apoptotic pathway activation or on the ability of the protein to repair cellular damage in the brains of Tg mice. In this study, we also suggest that SLNs-CUR could be an innovative tool for the treatment of AD.
