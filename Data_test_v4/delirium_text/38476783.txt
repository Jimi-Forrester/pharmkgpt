38476783|t|Exploring Esketamine's Therapeutic Outcomes as an FDA-Designated Breakthrough for Treatment-Resistant Depression and Major Depressive Disorder With Suicidal Intent: A Narrative Review.
38476783|a|The expansive spectrum of major depressive disorder (MDD) continues to pose challenges for psychiatrists to treat effectively. Oral antidepressant (OAD) medications that alter monoamine neurotransmitters, mainly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), have been the mainstay of therapy for decades. Although these drugs have been largely beneficial, a considerable subset of patients do not respond adequately to multiple conventional therapies administered for an appropriate length of time, leading to a diagnosis of treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Ketamine, a non-monoaminergic drug, has long been known for its beneficial effects on TRD when given intravenously (IV). Between 2019 and 2020, an intranasal formulation of the S (+) enantiomer of racemic ketamine, esketamine (ESK), was granted "breakthrough designation" by the FDA and approved for the indications of TRD and MDD patients exhibiting acute suicidal intent. The objective of this narrative review was to review the academic literature and collect clinical evidence that may corroborate intranasal ESK's effectiveness for its approved indications while addressing its safety and tolerability profile, adverse effects, and impact on cognition. An overview of the drug's origins, pharmacology, and standard treatment regimen are provided. The outcomes from double-blinded randomized control trials (DB-RCTs) of ESK are outlined to demonstrate the efficacy and safety data leading to its FDA approval, along with its long-term post-market safety outcomes. Comparative trials between ESK and ketamine are then evaluated to highlight ESK's consideration as a more practical alternative to ketamine in common clinical practice. The authors further discuss currently approved and developing therapies for TRD, propose future research directions, and identify the inherent limitations of the review and further research. To conduct the research required, three digital databases (PubMed, Medline, and ClinicalTrials.gov) were queried to search for key terms, including ketamine, esketamine, treatment-resistant depression, and biomarkers, using automation tools along with selective search engine results. After streamlining the results by title and abstract and removing duplicates, a total of 37 results were chosen, of which 18 are clinical trials. A reduction in the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score was the primary efficacy endpoint for most of these clinical trials. In conclusion, intranasal ESK, when used as an adjunct to market OADs, shows greater efficacy in treating TRD and MDD with suicidal intent compared to OADs and placebo alone and provides a more suitable alternative to IV ketamine. It is important to note that further research is required to fully understand the novel mechanism of action of ESK, as well as the establishment of a consensus definition of TRD, which may facilitate better detection and treatment protocols. More focused quantitative and qualitative ESK studies are needed, as well as those pertaining to its use in patients with co-existing mental illnesses.
