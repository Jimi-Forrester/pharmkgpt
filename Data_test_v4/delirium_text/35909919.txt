35909919|a|Over the last few decades, healthcare systems worldwide have seen many transformations, and one of the most significant transformations is the adoption of telemedicine. Its rapid and wide adoption has created an entirely different set of healthcare experiences. The healthcare field has vastly benefited from integrating technology and patient care. Johns Hopkins Aramco Healthcare (JHAH) has implemented several telehealth models as a response measure to overcome challenges in access to patient care due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This article describes the implementation of pharmacist-led telepsychiatry services utilized to provide several psychiatric services such as counseling patients, ensuring the appropriateness of medications prescribed, conducting therapeutic drug monitoring, and making clinical interventions to ensure a safe and effective therapy. By utilizing this newly integrated telepsychiatry model, pharmacists have continued to remain an integral part of improving patients' health outcomes and overall patient experience for psychiatric patients.
