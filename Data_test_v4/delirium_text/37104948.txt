37104948|a|OBJECTIVE: To determine key priorities for critical care nursing research in three Australian regional public hospitals, representing the shared priorities of healthcare professionals and patient representatives. METHODS: A three phase priority setting study, including consensus methods (nominal group), survey, qualitative interviews and focus groups were conducted between May 2021 and March 2022. Healthcare professionals and patient representatives from critical care units in regional public hospitals in Australia participated. A patient representative contributed to research design and co-authored this paper. RESULTS: In phase one, 29 research topics were generated. In phase two, during a nominal group ranking process, the top 5 priority areas for each site were identified. In the final phase, three themes from focus groups and interviews included patient flow through intensive care, patient care through intensive care journey and intensive care patient recovery. CONCLUSION: Identifying context specific research priorities through a priority setting exercise provides insight into the topics that are important to healthcare professionals and to patients in critical care. The top research priorities for nursing research in critical care in regional Australian hospitals include patient flow, patient recovery, and evidence based patient care through the intensive care journey, such as delirium management, pain and sedation, and mobilisation. These shared priorities will be used to guide future nursing research in critical care over the next 3-5 years. IMPLICATIONS FOR CLINICAL PRACTICE: The method we used in identifying the research priorities can be used by other researchers and clinicians; close collaboration among researchers and clinicians will be beneficial for practice improvement; and how we can be reassured that our practice is evidence based is worthy of attention.
