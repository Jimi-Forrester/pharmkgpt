38578891|t|Sex Differences in the Association Between LDL/HDL with Cognitive Decline in Older Adults: National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.
38578891|a|Background: Lipids have a significant impact on the development and functioning of the nervous system, but the sex differences between the association of LDL/HDL, which reflects lipid metabolic status, and cognitive impairment remains unclear. Objective: We aimed to determine if there were sex differences between the association of LDL/HDL and cognitive function in US older adults. Methods: This population-based cross-sectional study used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2011-2012 and 2013-2014 cycles. The main outcome was poor cognitive performance defined by the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) <  34 based on published literature. Results: A total of 1,225 participants were included in the study, with a cognitive impairment incidence of 25.6% (314/1,225). Multivariate regression models demonstrated a significant association between cognitive decline and each 1-unit increase in LDL/HDL, after adjusting for all covariates (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 1.36, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.11-1.67). Furthermore, subgroup analysis revealed an interaction between LDL/HDL and cognitive impairment in sex subgroups. Conclusions: LDL/HDL was associated with cognitive impairment in the US older adult population in adjusted models, although the significance of this association was not observed in females.
