33026686|t|Concentration-Dependent Interactions of Amphiphilic PiB Derivative Metal Complexes with Amyloid Peptides Abeta and Amylin*.
33026686|a|Metal chelates targeted to amyloid peptides are widely explored as diagnostic tools or therapeutic agents. The attachment of a metal complex to amyloid recognition units typically leads to a decrease in peptide affinity. We show here that by separating a macrocyclic GdL chelate and a PiB targeting unit with a long hydrophobic C10 linker, it is possible to attain nanomolar affinities for both Abeta1-40 (Kd =4.4 nm) and amylin (Kd =4.5 nm), implicated, respectively in Alzheimer's disease and diabetes. The Scatchard analysis of surface plasmon resonance data obtained for a series of amphiphilic, PiB derivative GdL complexes indicate that their Abeta1-40 or amylin binding affinity varies with their concentration, thus micellar aggregation state. The GdL chelates also affect peptide aggregation kinetics, as probed by thioflavin-T fluorescence assays. A 2D NMR study allowed identifying that the hydrophilic region of Abeta1-40 is involved in the interaction between the monomer peptide and the Gd3+ complex. Finally, ex vivo biodistribution experiments were conducted in healthy mice by using 111 In labeled analogues. Their pancreatic uptake, ~3 %ID g-1 , is promising to envisage amylin imaging in diabetic animals.
