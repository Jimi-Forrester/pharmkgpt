30776046|a|We assessed levels of plasma selenium (Se), selenoproteins and their change after Se supplementation in patients with mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) types I, II and VI. This was done in a retrospective study of the medical records of 30 patients with MPS I (n=13), MPS II (n=9) and MPS VI (n=8) who were being treated with enzyme replacement therapy. As part of routine nutritional monitoring, Se levels were measured, revealing that 28 patients (93.3%) had values below the normal range. Therefore, they received supplementation for 12 months, and Se was measured after 6 and 12 months. Glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity, total glutathione (GSHt), oxidized glutathione (GSSG) and reduced glutathione (GSH) were measured at baseline and 6 months after Se supplementation. The mean GSHt at baseline was 7.90 +- 2.36 mumol/g Hb, and after Se supplementation it was 5.76 +- 1.13 mumol/g Hb; GSH/GSSG was 2.3 +- 1.16 at baseline and 0.58 +- 0.38 after supplementation. GPx activity was 16.46 +- 3.31 U/g Hb at baseline and 4.53 +- 4.92 U/g Hb after Se supplementation. The difference was shown to be statistically significant by paired t-test. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that oxidative stress parameters were altered by Se supplementation in patients with MPS I, II and VI who were previously deficient in Se.
