36634940|t|Early recognition of pulmonary complications of sickle cell disease.
36634940|a|Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited hematological disorder with multiple-organ involvement. The pulmonary complications of SCD are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. This article presents an important review of acute and chronic pulmonary complications, including acute chest syndrome, pneumonia, pulmonary thromboembolism, pulmonary fat embolism, chronic sickle cell lung disease, and pulmonary hypertension, in patients with SCD. Bronchial asthma and obstructive sleep apnea in relation to SCD are discussed in this article. Early recognition of pulmonary complications leads to early therapeutic interventions and improvement of the overall treatment outcome.
