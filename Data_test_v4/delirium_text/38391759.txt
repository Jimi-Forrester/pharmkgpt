38391759|t|An Update on Emergent Nano-Therapeutic Strategies against Pediatric Brain Tumors.
38391759|a|Pediatric brain tumors are the major cause of pediatric cancer mortality. They comprise a diverse group of tumors with different developmental origins, genetic profiles, therapeutic options, and outcomes. Despite many technological advancements, the treatment of pediatric brain cancers has remained a challenge. Treatment options for pediatric brain cancers have been ineffective due to non-specificity, inability to cross the blood-brain barrier, and causing off-target side effects. In recent years, nanotechnological advancements in the medical field have proven to be effective in curing challenging cancers like brain tumors. Moreover, nanoparticles have emerged successfully, particularly in carrying larger payloads, as well as their stability, safety, and efficacy monitoring. In the present review, we will emphasize pediatric brain cancers, barriers to treating these cancers, and novel treatment options.
