35767725|t|Synthesis, in Vitro Cholinesterase Inhibition, Molecular Docking, DFT, and ADME Studies of Novel 1,3,4-Oxadiazole-2-Thiol Derivatives.
35767725|a|A series of 1,3,4-oxadiazole-2-thiol derivatives bearing various alkyl or aryl moieties were designed, synthesized, and characterized using modern spectroscopic methods to yield 17 compounds (6a-6q) that were screened for acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) enzymes in the search for 'lead' compounds for Alzheimer's disease treatment (AD). The compounds 6q, 6p, 6k, 6o, and 6l showed inhibitory capability against AChE and BChE, with IC50 values ranging from 11.73+-0.49 to 27.36+-0.29 muM for AChE and 21.83+-0.39 to 39.43+-0.44 muM for BChE, inhibiting both enzymes within a limited range. The SAR ascertained that the substitution of the aromatic moiety had a profound effect on the AChE and BChE inhibitory potential as compared to the aliphatic substitutions which were supported by the molecular docking studies. The drug-likeness of the most synthesized compounds was confirmed by in silico ADME investigations. These results were additionally supplemented by the molecular orbital analysis (HOMO-LUMO) and electrostatic potential maps got from DFT calculations. ESP maps expose that on all structures, there are two potential binding sites conquered by the most positive and most negative districts.
