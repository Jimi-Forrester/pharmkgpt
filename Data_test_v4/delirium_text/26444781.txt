OBJECTIVE: To validate the Spanish version of the Baylor Profound Mental Status Examination (BPMSE-Sp). METHODS: The Baylor Profound Mental Status Examination (BPMSE) was translated to Spanish and back translated. Validation was conducted in 100 patients with severe probable AD with a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) <12. We assessed internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha), concurrent validity (Pearson's correlations) with the MMSE, Severe Impairment Battery (SIB), Neuropsychiatric Inventory Short Form (NPI-Q) and the Functional Assessment Staging and reliability. RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 84.9; 74% were female; 64% were institutionalized. The mean MMSE was 5.6; the mean BPMSE-Sp was 13.6; the mean BPMSE-Sp behavior was 1.2; the mean SIB was 42.2; and the mean NPI-Q was 4.7. BPMSE-Sp presented good internal consistency (Cronbach alpha= 0.84). There were significant correlations between the BPMSE-Sp and MMSE (r = 0.86, p <  0.001), and between the BPMSE-Sp and SIB (r = 0.92, p <  0.001). Inter-rater and test-retest reliability were in both cases excellent, ranging between 0.96 and 0.99 (p <  0.001). BPMSE-Sp had fewer floor and ceiling effects than the MMSE. CONCLUSIONS: The BPMSE-Sp is a valid tool for use in daily practice and research in the evaluation of cognitive function of patients with severe AD.
