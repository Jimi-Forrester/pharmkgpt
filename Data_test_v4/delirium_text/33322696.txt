33322696|a|There has been supporting evidence that older adults with underlying health conditions form the majority of the fatal cases in the current novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. While the impact of COVID-19 is affecting the general public, it is clear that these distressful experiences will be magnified in older adults, particularly people living with Alzheimer's disease and related dementia (ADRD), making them the most vulnerable group during this time. People with differing degrees of ADRD are especially susceptible to the virus, not only because of their difficulties in assessing the threat or remembering the safety measures, but also because of the likelihood to be subject to other risk factors, such as lack of proper care and psychological issues. Therefore, in this article, we will discuss the challenges related to home-based care for people with ADRD during a pandemic and propose a formulation of systematic solutions to address these challenges and to alleviate the social and economic impact resulting from the crisis.
