28251365|t|Mitochondria in Alzheimer's Disease and Diabetes-Associated Neurodegeneration: License to Heal!
28251365|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a difficult puzzle to solve, in part because the etiology of this devastating neurodegenerative disorder remains murky. However, diabetes has been pinpointed as a major risk factor for the sporadic forms of AD. Several overlapping neurodegenerative mechanisms have been identified between AD and diabetes, including mitochondrial malfunction. This is not surprising taking into account that neurons are cells with a complex morphology, long lifespan, and high energetic requirements which make them particularly reliant on a properly organized and dynamic mitochondrial network to sustain neuronal function and integrity. In this sense, this chapter provides an overview on the role of mitochondrial bioenergetics and dynamics to the neurodegenerative events that occur in AD and diabetes, and how these organelles may represent a mechanistic link between these two pathologies. From a therapeutic perspective, it will be discussed how mitochondria can be targeted in order to efficaciously counteract neurodegeneration associated with AD and diabetes.
