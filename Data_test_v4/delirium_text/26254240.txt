26254240|t|Organotypic brain slice cultures: A review.
26254240|a|In vitro cell cultures are an important tool for obtaining insights into cellular processes in an isolated system and a supplement to in vivo animal experiments. While primary dissociated cultures permit a single homogeneous cell population to be studied, there is a clear need to explore the function of brain cells in a three-dimensional system where the main architecture of the cells is preserved. Thus, organotypic brain slice cultures have proven to be very useful in investigating cellular and molecular processes of the brain in vitro. This review summarizes (1) the historical development of organotypic brain slices focusing on the membrane technology, (2) methodological aspects regarding culturing procedures, age of donors or media, (3) whether the cholinergic neurons serve as a model of neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease, (4) or the nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons as a model of Parkinson's disease and (5) how the vascular network can be studied, especially with regard to a synthetic blood-brain barrier. This review will also highlight some limits of the model and give an outlook on future applications.
