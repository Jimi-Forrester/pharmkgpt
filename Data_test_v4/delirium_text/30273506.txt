30273506|t|Meningococcal disease in adolescents and young adults: a review of the rationale for prevention through vaccination.
30273506|a|Invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) caused by Neisseria meningitidis is characterized by high mortality and morbidity. While IMD incidence peaks in both infants and adolescents/young adults, carriage rates are often highest in the latter age groups, increasing IMD risk and the likelihood of transmission. Effective vaccines are available for 5 of 6 disease-causing serogroups. Because adolescents/young adults represent a significant proportion of cases, often have the highest carriage rate, and have characteristically low vaccination adherence, efforts should be focused on educating this population regarding long-term consequences of infection and the importance of meningococcal vaccination in prevention. This review describes the role of adolescents/young adults in meningococcal transmission and the clinical consequences and characteristics of IMD in this population. With a focus on countries with advanced economies that have specific meningococcal vaccination recommendations, the epidemiology of meningococcal disease and vaccination recommendations in adolescents/young adults will also be discussed.
