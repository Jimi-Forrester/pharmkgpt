39809646|t|Ultrasound-guided thoracic nerve blocks for emergency department patients with rib fractures: A review.
39809646|a|BACKGROUND: Rib fractures are frequently diagnosed and treated in the emergency department (ED). Thoracic trauma has serious morbidity and mortality, particularly in older adults, with complications including pulmonary contusions, hemorrhage, pneumonia, or death. Bedside ED-performed ultrasound-guided anesthesia is gaining in popularity, and early and adequate pain control has shown improved patient outcomes with rare complications. OBJECTIVE OF THE REVIEW: We describe thoracic nerve block options that can be used clinically for rib fractures or other thoracic pain or trauma. We identify the pros and cons of each type of block, describe their risk profile and advantages, and summarize the steps on how each is performed. DISCUSSION: Thoracic epidural and paravertebral blocks are more invasive, targeting the nerves closer to the spinal cord, thus they are primarily used in the operating room or by anesthesiology for surgical cases. However, newer blocks are gaining in popularity, particularly the erector spinae block (ESP), serratus anterior plane nerve block (SANB), and intercostal nerve block (ICNB). These blocks provide adequate anesthesia and can be performed in an ED setting. CONCLUSIONS: Thoracic nerve blocks (e.g., ESP, SANB, ICNB) can be performed safely by appropriately trained emergency physicians, provide excellent anesthesia for rib fractures and thoracic trauma, and should be strongly considered for improved patient-centered outcomes. Furthermore, performing regional nerve blocks in the emergency department can reduce complications including adverse effects from opioids or other delirium-inducing medications.
