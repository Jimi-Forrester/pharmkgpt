21718295|a|OBJECTIVES: Several studies have suggested the efflux transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp) to play a role in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease through the clearance of amyloid beta (Abeta) from the brain. In this study, we aimed to investigate the possibility of P-gp as a potential therapeutic target for Alzheimer's disease by examining the impact of P-gp up-regulation on the clearance of Abeta, a neuropathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: Uptake studies for 125I-radiolabelled Abeta1-40, and fluorescent immunostaining technique for P-gp and fluorescent imaging of Abeta1-40 were carried out in LS-180 cells following treatment with drugs known to induce P-gp expression. KEY FINDINGS: Approximately 10-35% decrease in 125I-Abeta1-40 intracellular accumulation was observed in cells treated with rifampicin, dexamethasone, caffeine, verapamil, hyperforin, beta-estradiol and pentylenetetrazole compared with control. Also, fluorescent micrographs showed an inverse relationship between levels of P-gp expression and 5-carboxyfluorescein labelled Abeta (FAM-Abeta1-40) intracellular accumulation. Quantitative analysis of the micrographs revealed that the results were consistent with those of the uptake studies using 125I-Abeta1-40. CONCLUSIONS: The investigated drugs were able to improve the efflux of Abeta1-40 from the cells via P-gp up-regulation compared with control. Our results elucidate the importance of targeting Abeta clearance via P-gp up-regulation, which will be effective in slowing or halting the progression of Alzheimer's disease.
