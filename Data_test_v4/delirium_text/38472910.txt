38472910|t|UPLC-ESI-MS/MS-Based Analysis of Various Edible Rosa Fruits Concerning Secondary Metabolites and Evaluation of Their Antioxidant Activities.
38472910|a|The genus Rosa is globally popular with well-established applications since it has a high edible and medicinal value. However, relatively limited research has been conducted on the composition and quality of wild Rosa fruits. The present study aimed to compare the properties and chemical components of five wild edible Rosa fruits, Rosa roxburghii, Rosa sterilis, Rosa laevigata, Rosa davurica, and Rosa sericea. The UPLC-ESI-MS/MS approach identified the key metabolites among the five Rosa fruits as flavonoids, phenolic acids, and organic acids. The main differential metabolites among the five fruits are flavonoids (22.29-45.13%), phenolic acids (17-22.27%), and terpenoids (7.7-24%), respectively. In total, 125 compounds served as potential markers for the five Rosa species. Differential metabolic pathways of five Rosa fruits were analyzed using the KEGG approach. Rosa laevigata fruits showed the highest total polysaccharide (TPS) content of 64.48 g/100 g. All the five Rosa extracts effectively decreased the levels of malondialdehyde while increasing the activities of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase in the H2O2-induced HaCaT cell model, demonstrating high potential for antioxidant development. Our findings suggest that the five studied Rosa fruits exhibit biological activity and edible value worth further exploration.
