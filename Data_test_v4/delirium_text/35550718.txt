35550718|a|PURPOSE: To analyse factors associated with mortality at 6 months in survivors older than 70 years after hospital admission for SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: Descriptive observational study with follow-up at 6 months. All patients over 70 years of age, discharged from the Hospital Central de la Cruz Roja, after hospitalization for COVID-19 consecutively during the months March to May 2020 were included. The outcome at 6 months (mortality, readmissions) were collected. RESULTS: A total of 165 patients were included. Mean age 88.5+-6.73, women 69.1%. High comorbidity 33.9%. Mean previous Barthel Index was 65.39+-33.64 and at discharge 58.12+-34.04. 24.2% had severe polypharmacy and 47.9% severe frailty. Six months after hospital discharge, 13% died and 23.8% required at least one readmission. More than half of the sample had some of the following sequelae: dyspnea 20%(33), functional impairment 41.7%(69), cognitive impairment 31.3%(52) or depressive symptoms 42.4%(70). Functional impairment at discharge was associated with an increased risk of mortality (OR 5.33; 95% CI 1.11-25.73). CONCLUSIONS: The functional status was a factor associated with risk of mortality at 6 months.
