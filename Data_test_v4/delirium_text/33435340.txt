33435340|a|This study retrospectively investigated the efficacy and safety of image-guided proton therapy (IGPT) for elderly (>=80 years old) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. Proton therapy was performed using respiratory-gated and image-guided techniques. Seventy-one elderly HCC patients were treated using IGPT. The Child-Pugh score was A5 in 49 patients, A6 in 15, and B7-9 in 7. Forty-seven patients with a peripherally located tumor were administered 66 gray relative biological effectiveness (GyRBE) in 10 fractions, whereas 24 with a centrally located tumor received 72.6 GyRBE in 22 fractions. The median follow-up period of surviving patients was 33 months (range: 9-68). Two-year overall survival (OS) and local control (LC) rates estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method were 76% (95% confidence interval: 66-87%) and 88% (80-97%), respectively. According to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0, no grade 2 or higher radiation-induced liver disease was observed, and only 1 patient developed grade 3 dermatitis. The quality of life score (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30 version 3.0, QLQ-HCC18, and SF-36) did not change after 1 year, except for the three-mental component summary (SF-36, improvement). IGPT is a safe and effective treatment for HCC in elderly patients.
