38287463|t|Insights into the mechanism of L-malic acid on drip loss of chicken meat under commercial conditions.
38287463|a|BACKGROUND: A deterioration in the meat quality of broilers has attracted much more attention in recent years. L-malic acid (MA) is evidenced to decrease meat drip loss in broilers, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are still unclear. It's also not sure whether the outputs obtained under experimental conditions can be obtained in a commercial condition. Here, we investigated the effects and mechanisms of dietary MA supplementation on chicken meat drip loss at large-scale rearing. RESULTS: Results showed that the growth performance and drip loss were improved by MA supplementation. Meat metabolome revealed that L-2-aminoadipic acid, beta-aminoisobutyric acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, and nicotinamide, as well as amino acid metabolism pathways connected to the improvements of meat quality by MA addition. The transcriptome analysis further indicated that the effect of MA on drip loss was also related to the proper immune response, evidenced by the enhanced B cell receptor signaling pathway, NF-kappaB signaling pathway, TNF signaling pathway, and IL-17 signaling pathway. CONCLUSIONS: We provided evidence that MA decreased chicken meat drip loss under commercial conditions. Metabolome and transcriptome revealed a comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Together, MA could be used as a promising dietary supplement for enhancing the water-holding capacity of chicken meat.
