38927458|t|Formation of Multinucleated Giant Cells after Experimental Intracerebral Hemorrhage: Characteristics and Role of Complement C3.
38927458|a|Hematoma clearance is critical for mitigating intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH)-induced brain injury. Multinucleated giant cells (MGCs), a type of phagocyte, and the complement system may play a pivotal role in hematoma resolution, but whether the complement system regulates MGC formation after ICH remains unclear. The current study investigated the following: (1) the characteristics of MGC formation after ICH, (2) whether it was impacted by complement C3 deficiency in mice and (3) whether it also influenced hematoma degradation (hemosiderin formation). Young and aged male mice, young female mice and C3-deficient and -sufficient mice received a 30 muL injection of autologous whole blood into the right basal ganglia. Brain histology and immunohistochemistry were used to examine MGC formation on days 3 and 7. Hemosiderin deposition was examined by autofluorescence on day 28. Following ICH, MGCs were predominantly located in the peri-hematoma region exhibiting multiple nuclei and containing red blood cells or their metabolites. Aging was associated with a decrease in MGC formation after ICH, while sex showed no discernible effect. C3 deficiency reduced MGC formation and reduced hemosiderin formation. Peri-hematomal MGCs may play an important role in hematoma resolution. Understanding how aging and complement C3 impact MGCs may provide important insights into how to regulate hematoma resolution.
