35565082|t|Cognitive Functions Associated with Brain Imaging Markers in Patients with Psoriasis.
35565082|a|Psoriasis is a severe inflammatory disease associated with a higher comorbidity of depression, cognitive dysfunction and brain atrophy. The association between psoriasis, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) markers and cognitive impairment has rarely been investigated, and the existing results are conflicting. METHODS: This study included 89 subjects (53 patients with psoriasis and 36 healthy controls). The severity of psoriasis was evaluated using the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score; for depression, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) scale was used. Neuropsychological tests were also applied, including a Trail Making Test (TMT) as well as Digit Span, Stroop, Verbal Fluency and Rey Auditory Verbal Learning tests. MRI scans were performed using a 1.5 T scanner. Brain volumetry, white matter lesions, grey matter and white matter were evaluated. The extent of these changes was assessed on the Fazekas scale. The differences between groups were evaluated using a Student's t-test and a Mann-Whitney U test, and a Pearson correlation analysis was also performed. RESULTS: Patients with psoriasis presented worse achievements on all the neuropsychological tests and showed more intense changes on MRI compared to healthy controls. The severity of psoriasis as determined by PASI scores was associated with depression, and a greater psychomotor slowness severity of changes in the brain was associated with poorer results on the neurological tests. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate the possibility of progressive brain atrophy related to cognitive decline in psoriasis.
