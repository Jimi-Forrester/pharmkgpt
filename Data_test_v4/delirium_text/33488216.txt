33488216|a|Coordination compounds containing dicyanoargentate(I) have remarkable biological potential due to their therapeutic antibacterial, antifungal, antibiofilm, and anticancer properties. In this study, a new dicyanoargentate(I)-based complex was synthesized and characterized by various procedures (elemental, thermal, FT-IR for complex) involving crystal analysis of the complex. In addition, the biological activity of this new compound on the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) enzyme, an important enzyme for the nervous system, was investigated. When the infrared (IR) spectrum of the complex is examined, the OH vibration peak resulting from H2O molecules in the structure at 3948-3337 cm-1 and at 2138 cm-1, along with a CN peak coordinated to Ag, can be seen, indicating that the mass remaining in the thermal degradation of the complex at 1000   C is the weight corresponding to the metal mixture consisting of K+Ag (calc.: 68.06). The crystal method revealed that the complex has a sandwich-like, polymeric chemical structure with layers formed by K+ cations and [Ag(CN)2H2O]- anions. Therefore, the AChE enzyme has potential therapeutic uses in improving ACh levels in brain cells, in reducing various side effects, and in improving cognitive impairment, especially in advanced Alzheimer's disease patients. In this study, the activity of this newly synthesized complex on AChE was also investigated. As a result of this research, [Ag(CN)2(H2O)K] had 0.0282 +- 0.010 muM Ki values against AChE. The compound was therefore a good inhibitor for the AChE enzyme. This type of compound can be used for the development of novel anticholinesterase drugs.
