Despite the development of various fluorescent probes, the majority of the fluorescent probes cannot move across the nuclear membrane. However, detection of the nuclear level of H2O2 is very important since it can directly cause oxidative DNA damage which ultimately leads to various diseases. Therefore, in this study, p-phenylenediamine based carbon quantum dots (B-PPD CDs) have been synthesized and integrated with 4-formylbenzeneboronic acid as a doping agent for the detection of H2O2. The detection mechanism showed that, upon exposure to H2O2, the fluorescence of the B-PPD CDs was immediately quenched. Further investigation has been done in the in vitro RAW 264.7 cell line by both exogenous and endogenous exposure of H2O2 to demonstrate the feasibility of the method. It is shown successfully that the exogenous presence and endogenous generation of H2O2 in RAW 264.7 cells can be detected using B-PPD CDs. The limit of detection (LOD) was determined to be 0.242 muM. The development of such imaging probes using carbon quantum dots will lead to live-cell imaging as well as ROS detection.
