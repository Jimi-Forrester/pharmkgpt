36443654|a|BACKGROUND: To ensure the sustainable implementation of dementia-specific person-centred care (PCC) in nursing homes, internal policies are crucial. The preliminary German Dementia Policy Questionnaire, which features 19 dichotomous items, assesses the existence of and evaluates these policies. This article reports the results of an exploration of the construct validity of the preliminary Dementia Policy Questionnaire. METHODS: This study is a cross-sectional study that references a secondary data set drawn from a national survey study of a randomized, stratified sample of 134 nursing homes in Germany. To explore the construct validity of the preliminary Dementia Policy Questionnaire, we conducted an adjusted multiple correspondence analysis of the pretested 19-item assessment. We included data assessed using the preliminary Dementia Policy Questionnaire from 134 care units associated with 134 nursing homes; these data were collected via telephone interviews with nursing home administrators or their representatives. RESULTS: Two items assessing visitor regulations and regulations regarding the inclusion of residents in staff selection were less frequent and were therefore excluded from the adjusted multiple correspondence analysis. In total, nine items were assigned to two dimensions. The items assigned to the first dimension assess existing regulations for PCC as well as existing regulations regarding the involvement of the resident, relatives and the multiprofessional team in the collection of information concerning preferences, case conferences or decision making. The items assigned to the second dimension assess existing regulations regarding the systematic assessment of resident preferences and their requirements. CONCLUSION: The study produces exploratory evidence concerning the preliminary Dementia Policy Questionnaire. Since the dimensions of the items included in this questionnaire cannot be conceptualized clearly, the instrument in its current state requires further development.
