34887498|a|People with type 2 diabetes (T2D) have increased cancer risk. Liver cancer (LC) has a high prevalence in East Asia and is one of the leading causes of cancer death globally. Diagnosis of LC at early stage carries good prognosis. We used stored serum from patients of Hong Kong Diabetes Register before cancer diagnosis to extract RNA to screen for microRNA markers for early detection of LC in T2D. After screening with Affymetrix GeneChip microarray with serum RNA from 19 incident T2D LC (T2D-LC), 20 T2D cancer free (T2D-CF) and 20 non-T2D non-cancer patients, top signals were validated in a 3-group comparison including 1888 T2D-CF, 127 T2D-LC, and 487 T2D patients with non-liver cancer patients using qPCR. We detected 2.55-fold increase in miR-122-5p and 9.21-fold increase in miR-455-3p in the T2D-LC group. Using ROC analysis, miR-122-5p and miR-455-3p jointly predicted LC with an area under the curve of 0.770. After adjustment for confounders, each unit increase of miR-455-3p increased the odds ratio for liver cancer by 1.022. Increased serum levels of miR-122-5p and miR-455-3p were independently associated with increased risk of incident LC in T2D and may serve as potential biomarkers for early detection of LC in T2D.
