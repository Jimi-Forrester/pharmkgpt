32867634|t|Tackling Alzheimer's Disease with Existing Drugs: A Promising Strategy for Bypassing Obstacles.
32867634|a|The unmet need for the development of effective drugs to treat Alzheimer 's disease has been steadily growing, representing a major challenge in drug discovery. In this context, drug repurposing, namely the identification of novel therapeutic indications for approved or investigational compounds, can be seen as an attractive attempt to obtain new medications reducing both the time and the economic burden usually required for research and development programs. In the last years, several classes of drugs have evidenced promising beneficial effects in neurodegenerative diseases, and for some of them, preliminary clinical trials have been started. This review aims to illustrate some of the most recent examples of drugs reprofiled for Alzheimer's disease, considering not only the finding of new uses for existing drugs but also the new hypotheses on disease pathogenesis that could promote previously unconsidered therapeutic regimens. Moreover, some examples of structural modifications performed on existing drugs in order to obtain multifunctional compounds will also be described.
