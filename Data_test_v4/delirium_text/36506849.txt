36506849|t|Comparison of Perioperative Outcomes in Patients Undergoing Short-Level Lumbar Fusion Surgery After Implementing Enhanced Recovery After Surgery: A Propensity Score Matching Analysis Focusing on Young-Old and Old-Old.
36506849|a|Background: There were exponentially increased studies focused on revealing the satisfactory outcomes after implementing enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) in patients undergoing lumbar fusion surgery. However, little attention has been paid to the impact of chronologic age alone on perioperative outcomes. Methods: In the present study, patients were dichotomized into two groups: young-old (65-79 years), and old-old (80 years and older). Given the heterogeneity and age-related comorbidities in this population and the need to compare similar groups, we performed propensity score matching for gender, body mass index (BMI), operation time, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), fusion levels and frail status. Perioperative outcomes were compared between two groups. Results: In our study, we found there were significant discrepancies in length of stay (LOS) (7.17 +- 2.81 vs 8.11 +- 3.57 days, p = 0.031) and postoperative nausea and vomiting (3.7% vs 11.0%, p = 0.038); however, there were no significant differences in C-reactive protein (21.50 +- 26.52 vs 19.22 +- 22.04 mg/L, p = 0.490), overall complication rates (24.8% vs 33.0%, p = 0.179), ambulation time (2.89 +- 1.34 vs 2.55 +- 1.49 days, p = 0.078) or removal of urinary catheter time (2.47 +- 1.44 vs 2.32 +- 1.40 days, p = 0.446). Conclusion: There were few differences in perioperative outcomes between young-old and old-old groups. Despite similar postoperative complication rates, the old-old group might experience longer LOS when complications occur. More importantly, current outcomes suggested that chronologic age alone does not appear to have the capacity to reflect the tolerance of elderly patients to surgery.
