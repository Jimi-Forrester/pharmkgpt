24629669|t|Network dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia: implications for psychiatry.
24629669|a|Structural and functional connectivity methods are changing how researchers conceptualize and explore neuropsychiatric disease. Here, we summarize emerging evidence of large-scale network dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease and behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia, focusing on the divergent impact these disorders have on the default mode network and the salience network. We update a working model for understanding the functions of these networks within a broader anatomical context and highlight the relevance of this model for understanding psychiatric illness. Finally, we look ahead to persistent challenges in the application of network-based imaging methods to patients with Alzheimer's disease, behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia, and other neuropsychiatric conditions. Recent advances and persistent needs are discussed, with an eye toward anticipating the hurdles that must be overcome for a network-based framework to clarify the biology of psychiatric illness and aid in the drug discovery process.
