33808027|a|Bacterial meningitis (BM) is an acute infectious central nervous system (CNS) disease worldwide, occurring with 50% of the survivors left with a long-term serious sequela. Acute bacterial meningitis is more prevalent in resource-poor than resource-rich areas. The pathogenesis of BM involves complex mechanisms that are related to bacterial survival and multiplication in the bloodstream, increased permeability of blood-brain barrier (BBB), oxidative stress, and excessive inflammatory response in CNS. Considering drug-resistant bacteria increases the difficulty of meningitis treatment and the vaccine also has been limited to several serotypes, and the morbidity rate of BM still is very high. With recent development in neurology, there is promising progress for drug supplements of effectively preventing and treating BM. Several in vivo and in vitro studies have elaborated on understanding the significant mechanism of melatonin on BM. Melatonin is mainly secreted in the pineal gland and can cross the BBB. Melatonin and its metabolite have been reported as effective antioxidants and anti-inflammation, which are potentially useful as prevention and treatment therapy of BM. In bacterial meningitis, melatonin can play multiple protection effects in BM through various mechanisms, including immune response, antibacterial ability, the protection of BBB integrity, free radical scavenging, anti-inflammation, signaling pathways, and gut microbiome. This manuscript summarizes the major neuroprotective mechanisms of melatonin and explores the potential prevention and treatment approaches aimed at reducing morbidity and alleviating nerve injury of BM.
