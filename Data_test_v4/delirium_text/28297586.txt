28297586|t|The Cleavage Effect of Mesenchymal Stem Cell and Its Derived Matrix Metalloproteinase-2 on Extracellular alpha-Synuclein Aggregates in Parkinsonian Models.
28297586|a|Ample evidence has suggested that extracellular alpha-synuclein aggregates would play key roles in the pathogenesis and progression of Parkinsonian disorders (PDs). In the present study, we investigated whether mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and their derived soluble factors could exert neuroprotective effects via proteolysis of extracellular alpha-synuclein. When preformed alpha-synuclein aggregates were incubated with MSC-conditioned medium, alpha-synuclein aggregates were disassembled, and insoluble and oligomeric forms of alpha-synuclein were markedly decreased, thus leading to a significant increase in neuronal viability. In an animal study, MSC or MSC-conditioned medium treatment decreased the expression of alpha-synuclein oligomers and the induction of pathogenic alpha-synuclein with an attenuation of apoptotic cell death signaling. Furthermore, we identified that matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), a soluble factor derived from MSCs, played an important role in the degradation of extracellular alpha-synuclein. Our data demonstrated that MSCs and their derived MMP-2 exert neuroprotective properties through proteolysis of aggregated alpha-synuclein in PD-related microenvironments.
