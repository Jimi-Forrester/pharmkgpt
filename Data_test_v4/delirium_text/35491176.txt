35491176|a|Objective This study assessed the risk factors of mortality from foreign bodies in the respiratory tract using the Japan Collaborative Cohort Study for the Evaluation of Cancer Risk data. Methods Data of 110,585 participants 40-79 years old living in 45 areas in Japan were collected between 1988 and 2009. Mortality from foreign bodies in the respiratory tract was assessed in a multivariable-adjusted analysis using a Cox proportional hazard regression model. Results Among all participants, 202 deaths occurred from foreign bodies in the respiratory tract. In the multivariable-adjusted model, older age [50-59 (hazard ratio, 4.93; 95% confidence interval, 1.91-12.74), 60-69 (hazard ratio, 14.96, 6.01-37.25) and 70-79 (hazard ratio, 53.81; 95% confidence interval, 21.44-135.02) years old compared to 40-49 years old], male sex (hazard ratio, 2.34; 95% confidence interval, 1.54-3.54), a history of apoplexy (hazard ratio, 7.04; 95% confidence interval, 4.24-11.67) and the absence of a spouse (hazard ratio, 1.56; 95% confidence interval, 1.05-2.32) were associated with an increased risk of mortality from foreign bodies in the respiratory tract. Conclusions Older age, male sex, medical history of apoplexy and the absence of a spouse were potential risk factors of mortality from foreign bodies in the respiratory tract. Especially in elderly men, social connections, such as cohabitation or relationships, may be important for ensuring the early detection of asphyxia and preventing death due to foreign bodies in the respiratory tract.
