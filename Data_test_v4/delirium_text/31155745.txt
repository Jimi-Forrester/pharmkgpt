31155745|a|OBJECTIVE: Aging is the highest risk factor for Parkinson disease (PD). Under physiological conditions, spermidine and spermine experimentally enhance longevity via autophagy induction. Accordingly, we evaluated the ability of each polyamine metabolite to act as an age-related, diagnostic, and severity-associated PD biomarker. METHODS: Comprehensive metabolome analysis of plasma was performed in Cohort A (controls, n = 45; PD, n = 145), followed by analysis of 7 polyamine metabolites in Cohort B (controls, n = 49; PD, n = 186; progressive supranuclear palsy, n = 19; Alzheimer disease, n = 23). Furthermore, 20 patients with PD who were successively examined within Cohort B were studied using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Association of each polyamine metabolite with disease severity was assessed according to Hoehn and Yahr stage (H&Y) and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor section (UPDRS-III). Additionally, the autophagy induction ability of each polyamine metabolite was examined in vitro in various cell lines. RESULTS: In Cohort A, N8-acetylspermidine and N-acetylputrescine levels were significantly and mildly elevated in PD, respectively. In Cohort B, spermine levels and spermine/spermidine ratio were significantly reduced in PD, concomitant with hyperacetylation. Furthermore, N1,N8-diacetylspermidine levels had the highest diagnostic value, and correlated with H&Y, UPDRS-III, and axonal degeneration quantified by DTI. The spermine/spermidine ratio in controls declined with age, but was consistently suppressed in PD. Among polyamine metabolites, spermine was the strongest autophagy inducer, especially in SH-SY5Y cells. No significant genetic variations in 5 genes encoding enzymes associated with spermine/spermidine metabolism were detected compared with controls. INTERPRETATION: Spermine synthesis and N1,N8-diacetylspermidine may respectively be useful diagnostic and severity-associated biomarkers for PD. ANN NEUROL 2019;86:251-263.
