38001775|a|There is accumulating evidence that vitamin A (VA) deficiency contributes to the pathogenesis and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), a metabolite of VA in the brain, serves distinct roles in the human hippocampus. Agonists of retinoic acid receptors (RAR), including ATRA, promote activation of the non-amyloidogenic pathway by enhancing expression of alpha-secretases, providing a mechanistic basis for delaying/preventing amyloid beta (Abeta) toxicity. However, whether ATRA is actually deficient in the hippocampi of patients with AD is not clear. Here, using a publicly available human transcriptomic dataset, we evaluated the extent to which ATRA-sensitive genes are dysregulated in hippocampal tissue from post-mortem AD brains, relative to age-matched controls. Consistent with ATRA deficiency, we found significant dysregulation of many ATRA-sensitive genes and significant upregulation of RAR co-repressors, supporting the idea of transcriptional repression of ATRA-mediated signaling. Consistent with oxidative stress and neuroinflammation, Nrf2 and NfkB transcripts were upregulated, respectively. Interestingly, transcriptional targets of Nrf2 were not upregulated, accompanied by upregulation of several histone deacetylases. Overall, our investigation of ATRA-sensitive genes in the human hippocampus bolsters the scientific premise of ATRA depletion in AD and that epigenetic factors should be considered and addressed as part of VA supplementation.
