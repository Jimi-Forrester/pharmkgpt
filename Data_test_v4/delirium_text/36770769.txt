36770769|t|Melatonin: A Potential Candidate for the Treatment of Experimental and Clinical Perinatal Asphyxia.
36770769|a|Perinatal asphyxia is considered to be one of the major causes of brain neurodegeneration in full-term newborns. The worst consequence of perinatal asphyxia is neurodegenerative brain damage, also known as hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy is the leading cause of mortality in term newborns. To date, due to the complex mechanisms of brain damage, no effective or causal treatment has been developed that would ensure complete neuroprotection. Although hypothermia is the standard of care for hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, it does not affect all changes associated with encephalopathy. Therefore, there is a need to develop effective treatment strategies, namely research into new agents and therapies. In recent years, it has been pointed out that natural compounds with neuroprotective properties, such as melatonin, can be used in the treatment of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. This natural substance with anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-apoptotic and neurofunctional properties has been shown to have pleiotropic prophylactic or therapeutic effects, mainly against experimental brain neurodegeneration in hypoxic-ischemic neonates. Melatonin is a natural neuroprotective hormone, which makes it promising for the treatment of neurodegeneration after asphyxia. It is supposed that melatonin alone or in combination with hypothermia may improve neurological outcomes in infants with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. Melatonin has been shown to be effective in the last 20 years of research, mainly in animals with perinatal asphyxia but, so far, no clinical trials have been performed on a sufficient number of newborns. In this review, we summarize the advantages and limitations of melatonin research in the treatment of experimental and clinical perinatal asphyxia.
