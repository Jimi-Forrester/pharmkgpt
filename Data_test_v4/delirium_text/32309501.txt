32309501|t|Large Cameron Ulcer Bleed.
32309501|a|Cameron ulcers usually present with chronic obscure gastrointestinal bleeding. Few cases of life-threatening bleeding have been reported. We hereby present an elderly man who presented with upper gastrointestinal bleeding associated with hemodynamic instability because of a large cratered Cameron ulcer. This ulcer contained a large pseudoaneurysm, and endoscopic therapy was deemed unsafe. The patient had a recurrence of his bleeding, necessitating intervention by our interventional radiology colleagues and then surgical intervention for definitive therapy. This case is important because it familiarizes gastroenterologists with the endoscopic appearance of huge Cameron ulcers and therapeutic options to control hemostasis. It also stresses the importance of a multidisciplinary team approach to ensure the best outcomes for patients.
