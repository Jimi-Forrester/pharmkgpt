37488870|t|Morphological disruption and visual tuning alterations in the primary visual cortex in glaucoma (DBA/2J) mice.
37488870|a|Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide, and previous studies have shown that, in addition to affecting the eyes, it also causes abnormalities in the brain. However, it is not yet clear how the primary visual cortex (V1) is altered in glaucoma. This study used DBA/2J mice as a model for spontaneous secondary glaucoma. The aim of the study was to compare the electrophysiological and histomorphological characteristics of neurons in the V1 between 9-month-old DBA/2J mice and age-matched C57BL/6J mice. We conducted single-unit recordings in the V1 of light-anesthetized mice to measure the visually induced responses, including single-unit spiking and gamma band oscillations. The morphology of layer II/III neurons was determined by neuronal nuclear antigen staining and Nissl staining of brain tissue sections. Eighty-seven neurons from eight DBA/2J mice and eighty-one neurons from eight C57BL/6J mice were examined. Compared with the C57BL/6J group, V1 neurons in the DBA/2J group exhibited weaker visual tuning and impaired spatial summation. Moreover, fewer neurons were observed in the V1 of DBA/2J mice compared with C57BL/6J mice. These findings suggest that DBA/2J mice have fewer neurons in the V1 compared with C57BL/6J mice, and that these neurons have impaired visual tuning. Our findings provide a better understanding of the pathological changes that occur in V1 neuron function and morphology in the DBA/2J mouse model. This study might offer some innovative perspectives regarding the treatment of glaucoma.
