32772327|t|Association between periodontitis and Alzheimer's disease and its impact on the self-perceived oral health status: a case-control study.
32772327|a|PURPOSE: To test the hypothesis that periodontitis is associated with AD and search whether periodontal and other variables would negatively impact the oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) perception. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Oral examinations and interview on self-perceived oral health status (Geriatric Oral Health Assessment Index (GOHAI) questionnaire (higher score corresponds to better perceived oral status)) were carried out and socio-demographic data were collected from outpatients with mild to moderate AD (cases, n = 50) and from their age- and sex-matched family caregivers (controls, n = 52). Full-mouth periodontal examination was performed. Significance of differences between groups was sought by chi-square, Student's t, or the Mann-Whitney test. The association between the variables periodontitis, probing depth (PD) >= 5 mm, and clinical attachment loss (CAL) >= 5 mm with the variable group was tested in binary logistic regression models (LRMs). LRMs were used to test the association of oral findings, demographics, and group with GOHAI. RESULTS: Cases had fewer teeth and greater CAL than controls. Cases had a superior percentage of sites with plaque, calculus, and bleeding on probing than controls. Cases had greater GOHAI scores than controls. Periodontitis was a variable most likely associated with AD (OR = 11.08, p < 0.001). None of the oral findings or demographics, but group, was associated with GOHAI (OR = 14.45, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Periodontitis is associated with AD, but not with patients' OHRQoL. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Health care professionals must be aware that AD patients should have a periodic thorough oral examination and preventive intervention aiming at their welfare and maintenance of a pain-free functional dentition.
