23247391|a|Alcohol withdrawal delirium (AWD) is often refractory to conventional medication. We report a prospective series of patients treated with alpha2-agonist dexmedetomidine added to conventional sedation. Eighteen patients with AWD were diagnosed by Confusion assessment method for ICU score. Treatment, complications, length of stay (LOS) in ICU and hospital were recorded. In addition, hospital and 1-year mortality were assessed. Dexmedetomidine was given for 23.9 (18.4) h [mean (SD)]. All the patients also received benzodiazepines but three patients were given haloperidole. No patient was intubated. The maximum infusion rate of dexmedetomidine was 1.5 (1.2) microg/kg/h. Time to resolution of AWD was 3.8 (1.3) days. The ICU LOS was 7.1 (2.7) days and in-hospital LOS 12.1 (4.5) days. No adverse events were observed although one patient died from acute pancreatitis. The use of dexmedetomidine in AWD seems safe but warrants further studies.
