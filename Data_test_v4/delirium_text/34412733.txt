34412733|t|Stilbene glucoside: recent advances in pharmacology, bioinformatics investigation, toxicity and future opportunities.
34412733|a|Background: 2,3,5,4'-Tetrahydroxystilbene-2-O-beta-<small>D</small>-glucoside (TSG) from Polygonum multijiorum Thunb. (PMT), is a major bioactive component. This review is aimed to summarize the present development of TSG regarding pharmaceutics, pharmacology and toxicology, with a focus on the novel mechanism of drug-induced toxicity and provides insight for its potential developments and applications in the future on traditional Chinese medicine. Methods: Studies about TSG's activities and toxicity were searched and summarized. Targets and mechanisms were predicted and analyzed with network pharmacology methods. Affinities and binding modes of key targets with TSG were verified by AutoDock Vina software. Results: TSG plays an essential role among the chemical components of PMT because of multiple pharmacological activities, which suggests a potential application of TSG for a variety of diseases, like atherosclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, cerebral I/R injury, diabetes, osteoporosis, colitis. However, mild liver toxicity of TSG is also pointed out. Conclusions: As a biologically active natural product in PMT, TSG has shown prospective pharmacological activities, particularly as an agent for cardiovascular protection and neuroprotection.
