37591147|t|An observational pilot study of sleep disruption and delirium in critically ill children.
37591147|a|BACKGROUND: Sleep disruption is frequently observed in children with delirium in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). OBJECTIVES: This observational pilot study explores relationships among modifiable characteristics of the PICU environment (i.e., light, sound, clinician caregiving patterns), sleep disruption, and delirium. METHODS: Ten children, 1 to 4 years old, were recruited within 48 h of PICU admission and followed until discharge. A light meter, dosimeter, and video camera were placed at bedside to measure PICU environmental exposures. Sleep was measured via actigraphy. Twice daily delirium screening was conducted. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the PICU environment, sleep, and delirium experienced by children. Bivariate analyses were performed to determine relationships among variables. RESULTS: Average participant age was 21 (SD = 9.6) months. Eight (80%) were admitted for respiratory failure. Median PICU length of stay was 36.7 (IQR[29.6, 51.5]) hours, which limited data collection duration. Delirium prevalence was 60% (n = 6). Children experienced low daytime light levels (x  = 112.8 lux, SD = 145.5) and frequent peaks (x  = 1.9/hr, SD = 0.5) of excessive sound (i.e., >= 45 A-weighted decibels). Clinician caregiving episodes were frequent (x  = 4.5/hr, SD = 2.6). Children experienced 7.3 (SD = 2.1) awakenings per hour of sleep and a median sleep episode duration of 1.4 (IQR[0.6, 2.3]) hours. On average, children with delirium experienced 1.1 more awakenings per sleep hour and 42 fewer minutes of sleep per sleep episode during the night shift. Increased clinician care frequency and duration were associated with worse sleep quality and delirium. CONCLUSIONS: Study results will inform future, large-scale research and nurse-driven sleep promotion interventions.
