19436617|a|The use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs has become ubiquitous worldwide and remains a common source of gastrointestinal morbidity. Antisecretory medications, particularly proton pump inhibitors, are effective in the treatment and prevention of NSAID-related gastrointestinal complications, including peptic ulcer disease and non-ulcer dyspepsia. A careful assessment of patients' risk factors for developing NSAID-related gastrointestinal complications should be undertaken prior to initiation of any NSAIDs. Patients who are considered at risk for developing gastrointestinal complications should receive concurrent antisecretory medical therapy to minimize the risk for GI complications.
