10840252|a|This paper addresses developments regarding new pharmacological treatments for people with Alzheimer's disease such as Donepezil and Rivastigmine. Following a brief discussion of the experience of people in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease, the pharmacology associated with these new treatments is outlined. The implications of these treatments for nurses working with this client-group are fully discussed within the context of assessment, treatment and cessation. It is argued that nurses have an important contribution in the management of these treatments and recommends that descriptive and evaluative research should be undertaken relating to this new specialist area of nursing care.
