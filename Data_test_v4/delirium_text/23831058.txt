23831058|a|Accumulation of amyloidogenic Abeta peptides in the brain contributes to the onset of Alzheimer disease. Abeta peptide deposits are also present in blood vessel walls, mainly deriving from circulating platelets. However, their effect on platelet function is unclear. We demonstrate that immobilized Abeta peptides induce platelet adhesion and spreading through metalloproteinase-sensitive surface receptors. Abeta peptides also fasten platelet spreading on collagen, and support the time- and ADP-dependent activation of adherent platelets, leading to stimulation of several signalling proteins. Our results indicate a potential role for peripheral Abeta peptides in promoting platelet adhesion and activation in the initiation of thrombus formation.
