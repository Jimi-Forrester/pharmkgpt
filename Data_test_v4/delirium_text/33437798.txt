33437798|t|A narrative review of non-pharmacological management of SARS-CoV-2 respiratory failure: a call for an evidence based approach.
33437798|a|A novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) belonging to genus beta-coronavirus has been associated with an acute respiratory disease termed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). As of September 3, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 had caused 867,219 fatalities in 188 nations across the globe. Rapid progression to bronchopneumonia manifesting with severe hypoxemia and eventual evolution into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) necessitating mechanical ventilation is the hallmark of this disease. The novel nature of COVID-19 pneumonia and the high morbidity and mortality associated with the same has vexed the critical care community. A cultural shift away from evidence-based medicine, and the impetus to attempt newer unproven therapies like awake proning, interleukin receptor 6 antagonists, inhaled nitric oxide, empiric anticoagulation etc. over modalities that have been tested over the decades is slowly gaining ground. The suggestions to delay intubations and liberalize tidal volumes have polarized the medical field like never before. The lack of consistency in management practices and establishing practices based on anecdotes and experiences can lead to devastating outcomes in the patients affected by this deadly virus. In this narrative review, we attempt to re-emphasize the need for an evidence-based approach to the management of COVID-19 related ARDS and review treatment strategies that have been established after rigorous trials and have stood the test of time.
