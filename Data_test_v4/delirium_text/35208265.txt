35208265|a|Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common liver pathology that includes steatosis, or non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL), and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Without a clear pathophysiological mechanism, it affects Hispanics disproportionately compared to other ethnicities. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and inflammatory lipid mediators including oxylipin (OXL) and endocannabinoid (eCB) are altered in NAFLD and thought to contribute to its pathogenesis. However, the existence of ethnicity-related differences is not clear. We employed targeted lipidomic profiling for plasma PUFAs, non-esterified OXLs and eCBs in White Hispanics (HIS, n = 10) and Caucasians (CAU, n = 8) with biopsy-confirmed NAFL, compared with healthy control subjects (HC; n = 14 HIS; n = 8 CAU). NAFLD was associated with diminished long chain PUFA in HIS, independent of histological severity. Differences in plasma OXLs and eCBs characterized ethnicities in NASH, with lower arachidonic acid derived OXLs observed in HIS. The secondary analysis comparing ethnicities within NASH (n = 12 HIS; n = 17 CAU), confirms these ethnicity-related differences and suggests lower lipoxygenase(s) and higher soluble epoxide hydrolase(s) activities in HIS compared to CAU. While causes are not clear, these lipidomic differences might be with implications for NAFLD severity and are worth further investigation. We provide preliminary data indicating ethnicity-specific lipidomic signature characterizes NASH which requires further validation.
