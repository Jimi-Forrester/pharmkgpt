It is a major health problem, less known and less addressed complication of diabetes mellitus. Objectives: The aim of the study is to assess prevalence of neurocognitive impairment and associated factors among diabetic mellitus patients. Methods: We conducted an institutional-based cross-sectional study involving 512 diabetic patients under follow-up at XXX Specialized Hospital from March 1 to April 30, 2023. Data on cognition, behavior, and depression were collected using standardized tools, including the Mini Mental State Examination for cognition, the CAGE assessment tool for alcohol-related behavior, and the PHQ-9 for depression. These assessments were conducted through face-to-face interviews and chart reviews. A diagnosis of diabetes is confirmed in adults when fasting blood glucose levels exceed 126 mg/dl in three consecutive follow-up measurements. Data entry was performed using Epidata version 4.6, and analysis was conducted using SPSS version 26. Variables with a P-value < 0.25 in bivariate analysis were included in multivariable logistic regression. Statistical significance was set at P <= 0.05 with a 95% CI. Results were presented using tables, graphs, and descriptive text. Results: The prevalence of neurocognitive impairment among diabetic patients at XXX Comprehensive Specialized Hospital was 28.3% [95% CI: 24.57-32.39]. Factors associated with this impairment included being female (AOR=2.29 [95% CI: 1.43-3.67]), rural residence (AOR=3.16 [95% CI: 2.01-4.95]), comorbidity (AOR=3.30 [95% CI: 2.08-5.23]), diabetes duration of 6-10 years (AOR=1.72 [95% CI: 1.01-2.94]), diabetes duration >10 years, and blood sugar level >126 mg/dl (AOR=2.25 [95% CI: 1.42-3.57]). Patients are encouraged to adhere to proper medication regimens to effectively control their blood glucose levels. This study found a high prevalence of neurocognitive impairment (NCI) among diabetic patients, affecting about one-fourth based on MMSE scores. Key risk factors identified include female gender, rural residence, comorbidities, longer duration of diabetes, and elevated blood glucose levels.
