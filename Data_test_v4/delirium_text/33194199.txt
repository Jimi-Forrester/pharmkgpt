33194199|a|Inflammatory cytokines are highly inducible small glycoproteins or regulatory proteins of low molecular weight secreted by different cell types. They regulate intercellular communication and mediate a number of physiological functions in the human immune system. Numerous prospective studies report that inflammatory cytokines strongly predict coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, heart failure and other adverse cardiac events. Inflammatory cascade is believed to be a causative factor in the development of atherosclerotic process. Several aspects of atherogenesis are accelerated by cytokines. This article provides an overall overview of current understanding of cytokines in various cardiovascular events. Besides, inflammatory cytokines trigger cellular events that can induce malignancy and carcinogenesis. Elevated expression of several cytokines such as interleukin-1, interleukin-6, interleukin-10, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, macrophage migration inhibitory factor and transforming growth factor-beta are involved in tumor initiation and progression. Thus, they exert a pivotal role in cancer pathogenesis. This review highlights the role of several cytokines in various events of tumorigenesis. Actually, this article summarizes the contributions of cytokines in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease and cancer.
