37834768|t|Exploring CAR-T Cell Therapy Side Effects: Mechanisms and Management Strategies.
37834768|a|Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has revolutionized the treatment of malignancies, especially hematological tumors, but toxicities have tempered its success. The main impediments to the development of CAR-T cell therapies are the following: cytokine release syndrome (CRS), immune-effector-cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), and on-target/off-tumor toxicity (OTOT). This review summarizes these side effects' underlying mechanisms and manifestations over time. It provides potential prevention and treatment according to the consensus grading, stressing the significance of establishing strategies that anticipate, reduce, and navigate the beginning of these side effects. It is essential to fully comprehend the mechanisms underlying these toxicities to create efficient treatment and preventive approaches.
