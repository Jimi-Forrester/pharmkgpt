22821385|t|Delirium during i. v. citalopram treatment: a case report.
22821385|a|This paper reports the case of a 65-year-old depressed man without somatic illnesses in whom monotherapy with i. v. citalopram induced delirium. He was admitted to a closed geriatric ward as a psychotically depressed patient with somatic and depressive delusions, and suicidal thoughts. Because he rejected all oral medications, monotherapy was initiated with 20 mg of i. v. citalopram per day. After 3 days, he became delirious and physically aggressive. This description of acute hyperkinetic delirium associated with i. v. citalopram therapy is the first one of this kind addressing side effects of i. v. citalopram.
