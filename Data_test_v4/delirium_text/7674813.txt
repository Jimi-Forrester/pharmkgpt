7674813|t|A "bridging" (safety/tolerance) study of besipirdine hydrochloride in patients with Alzheimer's disease.
7674813|a|Besipirdine hydrochloride is a novel compound with cholinergic and adrenergic activity being investigated as a treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD). The pharmacodynamics of some anti-dementia drugs are known to differ in patients with AD as compared with elderly normals. The present study was designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of multiple oral doses of besipirdine in AD patients. Twelve AD patients (NINCDS/ADRDA criteria; 7M, 5F, ages 58-75, mean age 65) were randomized to besipirdine (n = 9) or placebo (n = 3) in a double-blind, parallel-group, rising-dose design. Doses were 10, 20, 30, and 40 mg bid for 2 days each, followed by 50 and 60 mg bid for 5 days each. The most common adverse events were asymptomatic postural hypotension and asymptomatic bradycardia. Two patients on active drug developed severe adverse events: 1 after 3 days at 50 mg bid (nausea and vomiting); 1 after 3 days at 60 mg bid (angina). Due to the anginal episode, the study was terminated on Day 17. Plasma concentrations increased linearly with dose for besipirdine and its major metabolite. The two patients who developed severe adverse events had the highest plasma concentrations measured. Besipirdine 50 mg bid was considered the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).
