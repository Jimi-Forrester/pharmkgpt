28109317|a|BACKGROUND: Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is cleaved by beta-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) to produce beta-amyloid (Abeta), a critical pathogenic peptide in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Abeta generation can be affected by the intracellular trafficking of APP or its related secretases, which is thus important to understanding its pathological alterations. Although sorting nexin (SNX) family proteins regulate this trafficking, the relevance and role of sorting nexin-4 (SNX4) regarding AD has not been studied yet. METHODS: In this study, human brain tissue and APP/PS1 mouse brain tissue were used to check the disease relevance of SNX4. To investigate the role of SNX4 in AD pathogenesis, several experiments were done, such as coimmunoprecipitation, Western blotting, immunohistochemistry, and gradient fractionation. RESULTS: We found that SNX4 protein levels changed in the brains of patients with AD and of AD model mice. Overexpression of SNX4 significantly increased the levels of BACE1 and Abeta. Downregulation of SNX4 had the opposite effect. SNX4 interacts with BACE1 and prevents BACE1 trafficking to the lysosomal degradation system, resulting in an increased half-life of BACE1 and increased production of Abeta. CONCLUSIONS: We show that SNX4 regulates BACE1 trafficking. Our findings suggest novel therapeutic implications of modulating SNX4 to regulate BACE1-mediated beta-processing of APP and subsequent Abeta generation.
