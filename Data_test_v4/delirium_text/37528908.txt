37528908|t|Changes in Physiological Indices Before and After Nursing Care of Postoperative Patients With Esophageal Cancer in the ICU.
37528908|a|Introduction: Various stressors have been identified in patients in the intensive care unit (ICU), including postoperative pain, ventilatory management, and nursing care. However, sedated patients are less responsive, and nurses have difficulty capturing their stressors. Objective: To investigate patient stress caused by nursing care performed in the ICU on sedated patients based on changes in physiological indices. Methods: We observed nursing care performed on patients with postoperative esophageal cancer under sedation in the ICU. This included endotracheal suctioning and turning, the time required for the care, and the patients' behavioral responses. Information on arousal levels, autonomic nervous system indices, and vital signs were also obtained. The changes in indicators before and after care were then compared and analyzed. Results: There were 14 patients in the study. The mean age of the patients was 68 years. Ninety-nine scenes of nursing care were observed, and in six of these, additional bolus sedation was administered because of the patient's significant body movements. In endotracheal suctioning, no significant changes were observed in all indicators. In turning, vital signs changed significantly, and when both were continued, all indicators changed significantly. Conclusion: Our study found that different types and combinations of nursing care may cause different stresses to the patients. Moreover, the autonomic nervous system indices may be more likely to react to stresses in a variety of nursing care, while arousal levels may be more likely to react to burdensome stresses. If the characteristics of these physiological indicators can be understood and effectively utilized during care, it may be possible to better identify and reduce patient stress during sedation management.
