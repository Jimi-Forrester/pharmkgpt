36192770|a|BACKGROUND: Rectus sheath hematoma (RSH) is a relatively uncommon cause of acute abdominal pain and can be mistaken as other surgical causes of acute abdomen. A diagnosis requires high index of suspicion especially in susceptible patients, for example, in patients on anticoagulation. While anticoagulation is the commonest risk factor for RSH, direct-acting oral anticoagulants have only been very recently implicated as a potential cause with fewer than ten cases reported in the literature. CASE PRESENTATION: An 82-year-old Chinese man with chronic obstructive airway disease, ischemic heart disease, heart failure and atrial fibrillation on apixaban presenting with acute onset of lower abdominal pain. Physical examination showed peritoneal signs with tenderness and guarding over the lower quadrants with hypotension. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen confirmed a large rectus sheath hematoma (RSH) without active extravasation. He was given fluid resuscitation and was managed successfully with supportive treatment and cessation of apixaban. A follow-up CT two months later showed resolving hematoma and aspirin was resumed primarily for ischemic heart disease. The patient tolerated anti-platelet therapy without recurrence of RSH. The risk factors, treatment options, prognosis and issue related to anticoagulation resumption after an episode of RSH are discussed. Reported cases of RSH associated with direct-acting oral anticoagulants are reviewed. CONCLUSIONS: Direct-acting oral anticoagulant-associated rectus sheath hematoma is rare. With increasing use of direct-acting oral anticoagulants in multiple clinical settings, clinicians should remain vigilant of this potentially life-threatening bleeding complication when a patient presents with acute abdominal pain. Conservative treatment with cessation of anti-coagulant and supportive transfusion remains the mainstay of treatment.
