39337436|a|Programmed cell death (PCD) is a form of cell death distinct from accidental cell death (ACD) and is also referred to as regulated cell death (RCD). Typically, PCD signaling events are precisely regulated by various biomolecules in both spatial and temporal contexts to promote neuronal development, establish neural architecture, and shape the central nervous system (CNS), although the role of PCD extends beyond the CNS. Abnormalities in PCD signaling cascades contribute to the irreversible loss of neuronal cells and function, leading to the onset and progression of neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we summarize the molecular processes and features of different modalities of PCD, including apoptosis, necroptosis, pyroptosis, ferroptosis, cuproptosis, and other novel forms of PCD, and their effects on the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), multiple sclerosis (MS), traumatic brain injury (TBI), and stroke. Additionally, we examine the key factors involved in these PCD signaling pathways and discuss the potential for their development as therapeutic targets and strategies. Therefore, therapeutic strategies targeting the inhibition or facilitation of PCD signaling pathways offer a promising approach for clinical applications in treating neurodegenerative diseases.
