33335774|a|Food consumption during the rest phase promotes circadian desynchrony, which is corrected with harmful physiological and mental disorders. Previously, we found that circadian desynchrony was involved in isoflurane-induced cognitive impairment. Here, we scheduled food access to modulate daily rhythm to examine its impact on isoflurane-induced cognitive impairments. Mice were randomly transferred to restricted feeding (RF) time groups: Control group (Zeitgeber time (ZT) 0-ZT24, ad libitum feeding), Day-Feeding group (ZT0-ZT12, misaligned feeding), and Night-Feeding group (ZT12-ZT24, aligned feeding). Then, some of them were subjected to 5 h of 1.3% isoflurane anaesthesia from ZT14 to ZT19 and were divided into the Control + Anes group, the Day-Feeding + Anes group, and the Night-Feeding + Anes group. Mini-Mitter was used to monitor the daily rhythm. Fear conditioning system was conducted to assess cognition of mice. We observed that the Night-Feeding group adapted to RF gradually, whereas the Day-Feeding group exhibited a disturbed daily rhythm. The Night-Feeding + Anes group exhibited a partially enhanced daily rhythm, whereas the Day-Feeding + Anes group exhibited sustained phase advances and diurnality score increase 7 days after isoflurane anaesthesia. Notably, in tests of hippocampus-dependent contextual memory, the Night-Feeding + Anes group demonstrated decreased deficits; the Day-Feeding + Anes group showed prolonged post-anaesthetic deficits 14 days after isoflurane anaesthesia. However, amygdala-dependent cued-fear conditioning post-anaesthesia was not altered by the RF schedule. In conclusion, we demonstrated that misaligned feeding disturbed the daily rhythm and led to persistent post-anaesthetic cognitive dysfunction. Aligned feeding enhanced the daily rhythm partially and improved post-anaesthetic cognitive dysfunction.
