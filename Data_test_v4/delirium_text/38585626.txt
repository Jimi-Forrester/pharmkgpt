38585626|t|Kaempferol regulates apoptosis and migration of neural stem cells to attenuate cerebral infarction by O-GlcNAcylation of beta-catenin.
38585626|a|Ischemic stroke remains a major cause of disability and death. Kaempferol (Kae) is a neuroprotective flavonoid compound. Thus, this study aimed to explore the impact of Kae on cerebral infarction. We generated the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) mouse model to study the effects of Kae on infarction volume and neurological function. The oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD)/reoxygenation (R) model of neural stem cells (NSCs) was established to study the effects of Kae on cell viability, migration, and apoptosis. Cell processes were assessed by cell counting kit-8, Transwell assay, flow cytometry, and TUNEL analysis. The molecular mechanism was assessed using the Western blot. The results indicated that Kae attenuated MCAO-induced cerebral infarction and neurological injury. Besides, Kae promoted cell viability and migration and inhibited apoptosis of OGD/R-treated NSCs. Moreover, OGD/R suppressed total O-GlcNAcylation level and O-GlcNAcylation of beta-catenin, thereby suppressing the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway, whereas Kae reversed the suppression. Inactivation of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway abrogated the biological functions of NSCs mediated by Kae. In conclusion, Kae suppressed cerebral infarction by facilitating NSC viability, migration, and inhibiting apoptosis. Mechanically, Kae promoted O-GlcNAcylation of beta-catenin to activate the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. Kae may have a lessening effect on ischemic stroke.
