35863293|a|BACKGROUND: Subjective or objective subtle cognitive decline (SCD) is considered the preclinical manifestation of Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is a potentially crucial window for preventing or delaying the progression of the disease. METHODS: To explore the potential mechanism of disease progression and identify relevant biomarkers, we comprehensively assessed the peripheral blood transcriptomic alterations in SCD, covering lncRNA, mRNA, and miRNA. FINDINGS: Dysregulated protein-coding mRNA at both gene and isoform levels implicated impairment in the type I interferon signaling pathway in SCD. Specifically, this pathway was regulated by the transcription factor STAT1 and ncRNAs NRIR and has-miR-146a-5p. The miRNA-mRNA-lncRNA co-expression network revealed hub genes for the interferon module. Individuals with lower interferon signaling activity and lower expression of a hub gene STAT1 exhibited a higher conversion rate to mild cognitive impairment (MCI). INTERPRETATION: Our findings illustrated the down-regulation of interferon signaling activity would potentially increase the risk of disease progression and thus serve as a pre-disease biomarker.
