36827109|t|Marine-Derived Natural Product HDYL-GQQ-495 Targets P62 to Inhibit Autophagy.
36827109|a|Autophagy is widely implicated in pathophysiological processes such as tumors and metabolic and neurodegenerative disorders, making it an attractive target for drug discovery. Several chemical screening approaches have been developed to uncover autophagy-modulating compounds. However, the modulation capacity of marine compounds with significant pharmacological activities is largely unknown. We constructed an EGFPKI-LC3B cell line using the CRISPR/Cas9 knock-in strategy in which green fluorescence indicated endogenous autophagy regulation. Using this cell line, we screened a compound library of approximately 500 marine natural products and analogues to investigate molecules that altered the EGFP fluorescence. We identified eight potential candidates that enhanced EGFP fluorescence, and HDYL-GQQ-495 was the leading one. Further validation with immunoblotting demonstrated that cleaved LC3 was increased in dose- and time-dependent manners, and the autophagy adaptor P62 showed oligomerization after HDYL-GQQ-495 treatment. We also demonstrated that HDYL-GQQ-495 treatment caused autophagy substrate aggregation, which indicated that HDYL-GQQ-495 serves as an autophagy inhibitor. Furthermore, HDYL-GQQ-495 induced Gasdermin E (GSDME) cleavage and promoted pyroptosis. Moreover, HDYL-GQQ-495 directly combined with P62 to induce P62 polymerization. In P62 knockout cells, the cleavage of LC3 or GSDME was blocked after HDYL-GQQ-495 treatment. The EGFPKI-LC3B cell line was an effective tool for autophagy modulator screening. Using this tool, we found a novel marine-derived compound, HDYL-GQQ-495, targeting P62 to inhibit autophagy and promote pyroptosis.
