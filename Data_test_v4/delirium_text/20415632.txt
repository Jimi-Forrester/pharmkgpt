20415632|a|Behavioral and psychotic symptoms are common problems in older adults, and as the population ages, understanding the benefits and risks of antipsychotic usage is increasingly important. In this age group, psychotic symptoms may occur in patients with dementia or as part of schizophrenia, mood disorders, delirium, or delusional disorder. Various antipsychotics have been studied in older adults with psychotic symptoms, demonstrating mixed, but real, benefit, especially in relation to carefully selected patients. Caution is required because of the potential side effects and risks, which include increased mortality and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. This article reviews the use of antipsychotics in older adults, with emphasis on the risks and side effects, particularly in dementia patients with behavioral and psychotic symptoms.
