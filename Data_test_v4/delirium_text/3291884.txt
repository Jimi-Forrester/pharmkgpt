3291884|t|An NMR study of cerebral oedema and its biological correlates during withdrawal from alcohol.
3291884|a|Five chronic alcoholic patients admitted for detoxification were studied. During the first 24-48 hr of abstinence raised levels of cerebral water (as measured by NMR), vasopressin, renin and supine aldosterone were recorded. Initial vasopressin concentration was correlated (r = 0.88, P less than 0.05) with alcohol consumption in the week prior to admission and was over three times higher in the patients measured after 24-48 hr as compared to less than 24 hr. After one week only supine aldosterone was still raised (P less than 0.05). The results suggest that cerebral oedema occurs during the early stages of abstinence. The role of these changes in the aetiology of withdrawal symptoms, delirium tremens and brain damage remains to be elucidated.
