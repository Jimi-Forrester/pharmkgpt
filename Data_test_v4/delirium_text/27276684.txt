27276684|t|MEF2C rs190982 polymorphism with late-onset Alzheimer's disease in Han Chinese: A replication study and meta-analyses.
27276684|a|The myocyte enhancer factor (MEF2) family of transcription factors plays a vital role in memory and learning due to its functions in regulating synapse number and reducing dendritic spines. Myocyte enhancer factor 2 C (MEF2C) is regarded as modulator of amyloid-protein precursor (APP) proteolytic processing, in which amyloid-beta (Abeta) is produced. A common single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP, rs190982) in MEF2C gene was identified to be related to late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) in Caucasians in a large meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Here, we recruited unrelated 984 LOAD patients and 1348 healthy controls matched for gender and age to ascertain whether the rs190982 polymorphism is related to LOAD in Han Chinese. No difference in the genotype and allele distributions of the MEF2C rs190982 polymorphism was found between LOAD cases and healthy controls (genotype: P = 0.861; allele: P = 0.862), even after stratification for APOE epsilon4 allele as well as statistical adjustment for age, gender and APOE epsilon4 status. Furthermore, the meta-analysis in 4089 Chinese individuals did not detect the association of rs190982 within MEF2C with the risk for LOAD (OR = 1.03, 95%CI = 0.90-1.18). Overall, the current evidence did not support the relation between rs190982 polymorphism within MEF2C and the LOAD risk in Northern Han Chinese.
