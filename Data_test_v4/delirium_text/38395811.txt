38395811|t|Study on predictive models for swallowing risk in patients with AECOPD.
38395811|a|BACKGROUND: Dysphagia is considered a complication in patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD). However, AECOPD may have risk factors for dysphagia. METHODS: Through a cross-sectional study, which included 100 patients with AECOPD. General information, Pulmonary function, COPD assessment test (CAT) and modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) were collected by questionnaire. The questionnaires were administered by uniform-trained investigators using standard and neutral language, and swallowing risk was assessed by using a water swallow test (WST) on the day of patient admission. RESULTS: Among the 100 included patients, 50(50%) were at risk of swallowing. Multivariate analysis using logistic regression analysis showed that age >= 74 years old, mMRC >= level 2, hospitalization days >= 7 days and the use of BIPAP assisted ventilation were important influencing factors for swallowing risk in patients with AECOPD. CONCLUSION: Patients with AECOPD are at risk for dysphagia, assessing age, mMRC, hospitalization days and the use of BIPAP assisted ventilation can be used to screen for swallowing risk, thus contributing to the implementation of early prevention measures.
