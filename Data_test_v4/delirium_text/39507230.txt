39507230|t|Iron accumulation/overload and Alzheimer's disease risk factors in the precuneus region: A comprehensive narrative review.
39507230|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that is characterized by amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and neuronal loss. Early cerebral and body iron dysregulation and accumulation interact with AD pathology, particularly in the precuneus, a crucial functional hub in cognitive functions. Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM), a novel post-processing approach, provides insights into tissue iron levels and cerebral oxygen metabolism and reveals abnormal iron accumulation early in AD. Increased iron deposition in the precuneus can lead to oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and accelerated neurodegeneration. Metabolic disorders (diabetes, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and obesity), genetic factors, and small vessel pathology contribute to abnormal iron accumulation in the precuneus. Therefore, in line with the growing body of literature in the precuneus region of patients with AD, QSM as a neuroimaging method could serve as a non-invasive biomarker to track disease progression, complement other imaging modalities, and aid in early AD diagnosis and monitoring.
