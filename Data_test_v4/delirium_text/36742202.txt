36742202|a|Background: Induction of general anesthesia with propofol induces radical changes in cortical network organization, leading to unconsciousness. While perioperative frontal electroencephalography (EEG) has been widely implemented in the past decades, validated and age-independent EEG markers for the timepoint of loss of consciousness (LOC) are lacking. Especially the appearance of spatially coherent frontal alpha oscillations (8-12 Hz) marks the transition to unconsciousness.Here we explored whether decomposing the EEG spectrum into its periodic and aperiodic components unveiled markers of LOC and investigated their age-dependency. We further characterized the LOC-associated alpha oscillations by parametrizing the adjusted power over the aperiodic component, the center frequency, and the bandwidth of the peak in the alpha range. Methods: In this prospective observational trial, EEG were recorded in a young (18-30 years) and an elderly age-cohort (>= 70 years) over the transition to propofol-induced unconsciousness. An event marker was set in the EEG recordings at the timepoint of LOC, defined with the suppression of the lid closure reflex. Spectral analysis was conducted with the multitaper method. Aperiodic and periodic components were parametrized with the FOOOF toolbox. Aperiodic parametrization comprised the exponent and the offset. The periodic parametrization consisted in the characterization of the peak in the alpha range with its adjusted power, center frequency and bandwidth. Three time-segments were defined: preLOC (105 - 75 s before LOC), LOC (15 s before to 15 s after LOC), postLOC (190 - 220 s after LOC). Statistical significance was determined with a repeated-measures ANOVA. Results: Loss of consciousness was associated with an increase in the aperiodic exponent (young: p = 0.004, elderly: p = 0.007) and offset (young: p = 0.020, elderly: p = 0.004) as well as an increase in the adjusted power (young: p < 0.001, elderly p = 0.011) and center frequency (young: p = 0.008, elderly: p < 0.001) of the periodic alpha peak. We saw age-related differences in the aperiodic exponent and offset after LOC as well as in the power and bandwidth of the periodic alpha peak during LOC. Conclusion: Decomposing the EEG spectrum over induction of anesthesia into its periodic and aperiodic components unveiled novel age-independent EEG markers of propofol-induced LOC: the aperiodic exponent and offset as well as the center frequency and adjusted power of the power peak in the alpha range.
