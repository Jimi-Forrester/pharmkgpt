34739450|a|ABSTRACT: Emergence delirium is a common complication after sevoflurane-anesthesia and have a serious impact on children undergoing cleft palate surgery. The aim of this study was to compare the effect of propofol and dexmedetomidine on emergence delirium in children. Ninety children aged 8 to 24 months, underwent cleft palate repair, were enrolled in the study. Children were randomly assigned to 3 groups after the induction: Group C (intravenous infusion 0.9% saline), Group P (intravenous infusion 2 mg/kg/hour propofol), and Group D (intravenous infusion 0.5 mug/kg/hour dexmedetomidine). Emergence delirium was diagnosed using the pediatric anesthesia emergence delirium scale and pain using the face, legs, activity, cry, consolability scale. Heart rate, mean arterial pressure, respiratory recovery time, extubation time, post anesthesia care unit observation time, and adverse events were also evaluated. A total of 86 patients were analyzed. The incidence of emergence delirium was 20.1% in group D, 58.6% in group P and 85.7% in group C (P < 0.05). A lower face, legs, activity, cry, consolability score was seen in group D than in group P and group C (3.9 + 1.1 versus 6.1 +- 0.9 and 7.1 +- 1.0, P < 0.05). The value of heart rate and mean arterial pressure during emergence in group P and group C were significantly higher than that in group D (All P < 0.05). These findings suggest that dexmedetomidine as a sedative, analgesic, and sympatholytic agent was superior to propofol in reducing the incidence of emergence delirium in children undergoing cleft palates surgery with sevoflurane-based anesthesia.
