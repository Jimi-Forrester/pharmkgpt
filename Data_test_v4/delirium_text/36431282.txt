36431282|t|COVID-19 Clinical Features and Outcomes in Elderly Patients during Six Pandemic Waves.
36431282|a|Many elderly patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19 infections are admitted to intensive care units. Age was previously identified as an independent risk factor for death and contributed to the greater severity of COVID-19. The elderly may have diminished lung functions, poor reactions to artificial ventilation, and compromised immune systems. However, it is yet uncertain how each pandemic wave and the predominant SARS-CoV-2 strains contribute to varying results and how patient groups such as the elderly are impacted. Comparing six COVID-19 pandemic waves, the objective of this study was to examine the variation in case severity, symptomatology, ICU hospitalizations, and mortality among SARS-CoV-2-infected elderly individuals. The study followed a retrospective design, including 60 eligible patients older than 70 years in each of the six pandemic wave groups, after matching them by the number of comorbidities and gender. SARS-CoV-2 infection during the first, third, and fourth pandemic waves had a significantly higher risk of mortality for hospitalized patients. Confusion and dyspnea at admission were significant risk factors for ICU admission in elderly patients (beta = 1.92, respectively beta = 3.65). The laboratory parameters identified decreased lymphocytes (beta = 2.11), elevated IL-6 (beta = 1.96), and procalcitonin (beta = 2.46) as the most significant risk factors. The third and fourth COVID-19 waves had considerably more severe infections (31.7% and 26.7%) than the sixth wave (13.3%). Median ICU stay and percentage of patients receiving oxygen support also differed across pandemic waves. However, mortality rates between the six pandemic waves were similar. The average length of hospitalization varied dramatically among the six pandemic waves. Although senior patients are more likely to have worse COVID-19 outcomes after hospitalization, this risk is mitigated by the greater prevalence of comorbidities and frailty among the elderly. The six pandemic waves that were specifically evaluated did not reveal considerably disproportionate variations in terms of patient mortality; however, during the fourth pandemic wave, there were likely more hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 in Romania. It is probable that certain circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains were more infectious, resulting in an increase in infections and a strain on healthcare systems, which might explain the variations found in our research.
