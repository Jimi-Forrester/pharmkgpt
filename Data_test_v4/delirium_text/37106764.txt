37106764|t|Individual Proportion Loss of Functional Connectivity Strength: A Novel Individual Functional Connectivity Biomarker for Subjective Cognitive Decline Populations.
37106764|a|High individual variation in the subjective cognitive decline (SCD) population makes functional connectivity (FC) biomarkers unstable. This study proposed a novel individual FC index, named individual proportion loss of functional connectivity strength (IPLFCS), and explored potential biomarkers for SCD using this new index. We proposed an IPLFCS analysis framework and compared it with traditional FC in Chinese and Western cohorts. Post hoc tests were used to determine biomarkers. Pearson's correlation analysis was used to investigate the correlation between neuropsychological scores or cortical amyloid deposits and IPLFCS biomarkers. Receiver operating characteristic curves were utilized to evaluate the ability of potential biomarkers to distinguish between groups. IPLFCS of the left middle temporal gyrus (LMTG) was identified as a potential biomarker. The IPLFC was correlated with the traditional FC (r = 0.956, p < 0.001; r = 0.946, p < 0.001) and cortical amyloid deposition (r = -0.245, p = 0.029; r = -0.185, p = 0.048) in both cohorts. Furthermore, the IPLFCS decreased across the Alzheimer's disease (AD) continuum. Its diagnostic efficiency was superior to that of existing fMRI biomarkers. These findings suggest that IPLFCS of the LMTG could be a potential biomarker of SCD.
