36900794|t|Insomnia among Cancer Patients in the Real World: Optimising Treatments and Tailored Therapies.
36900794|a|BACKGROUND: Insomnia is commonly reported by cancer patients. Its multifaceted pathophysiology makes this symptom a complex challenge for the clinician, who should bear in mind the manifold world of causes and consequences of sleep disturbances in these patients and the importance of accurate treatment that should consider the frequent co-prescription of multiple medications. With our work, we aim to provide a tool to better master the treatment of this symptom in cancer patients, considering the gap between clinical and pharmacodynamic knowledge about the efficacy of different molecules and evidence-based prescribing. METHODS: A narrative review of the studies investigating the pharmacological treatment of insomnia in cancer patients was conducted. Three hundred and seventy-six randomised controlled trials (RCTs), systematic reviews and meta-analyses were identified through PubMed. Only publications that investigated the efficacy of the pharmacological treatment of insomnia symptoms in cancer patient were considered. RESULTS: Among the 376 publications that were individuated, fifteen studies were eligible for inclusion in the review and were described. Pharmacological treatments were outlined, with a broad look at specific clinical situations. CONCLUSIONS: The management of insomnia in cancer patients should be personalised, as is already the case for the treatment of pain, taking into account both the pathophysiology and the other medical treatments prescribed to these patients.
