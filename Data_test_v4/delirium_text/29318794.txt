29318794|t|Osteosarcopenia in Patients with Hip Fracture Is Related with High Mortality.
29318794|a|BACKGROUND: This study evaluated the prevalence of osteosarcopenia, as well as the relationship between one-year mortality and osteosarcopenia, as defined by criteria of the Asian Working Group on Sarcopenia in patients age 60 or older with hip fracture. METHODS: A total of 324 patients age 60 years or older with hip fracture were enrolled in this retrospective observational study. The main outcome measure was the prevalence of osteosarcopenia, as well as the relationship between osteosarcopenia and 1-year mortality. The diagnosis of sarcopenia was carried out according to the Asian Working Group on Sarcopenia. Whole body densitometry analysis was used for skeletal muscle mass measurement and muscle strength were evaluated by handgrip testing. Mortality was assessed at the end of 1-year. Cox regression analysis was utilized to analyze the risk factor of osteosarcopenia. RESULTS: Of 324 patients with hip fracture, 93 (28.7%) were diagnosed with osteosarcopenia. In total, 9.0% died during the one-year follow-up. A one-year mortality of osteosarcopenia (15.1%) was higher than that of other groups (normal: 7.8%, osteoporosis only: 5.1%, sarcopenia only: 10.3%). Osteosarcopenia had a 1.8 times higher mortality rate than non-osteosarcopenia. CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrates that the prevalence of osteosarcopenia is not rare, and has a higher mortality rate than the non-osteosarcopenia group at the 1-year follow-up period. This is the first study evaluating the relationship between mortality and osteosarcopenia in patients with hip fracture.
