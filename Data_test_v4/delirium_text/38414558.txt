38414558|a|Cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD), as the most common, chronic and progressive vascular disease on the brain, is a serious neurological disease, whose pathogenesis remains unclear. The disease is a leading cause of stroke and vascular cognitive impairment and dementia, and contributes to about 20% of strokes, including 25% of ischemic strokes and 45% of dementias. Undoubtedly, the high incidence and poor prognosis of CSVD have brought a heavy economic and medical burden to society. The present treatment of CSVD focuses on the management of vascular risk factors. Although vascular risk factors may be important causes or accelerators of CSVD and should always be treated in accordance with best clinical practice, controlling risk factors alone could not curb the progression of CSVD brain injury. Therefore, developing safer and more effective treatment strategies for CSVD is urgently needed. Recently, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) therapy has become an emerging therapeutic modality for the treatment of central nervous system disease, given their paracrine properties and immunoregulatory. Herein, we discussed the therapeutic potential of MSCs for CSVD, aiming to enable clinicians and researchers to understand of recent progress and future directions in the field.
