34848959|t|Preliminary Findings on Visual Event-Related Potential P3 in Asymptomatic Patients with Cerebral Small Vessel Disease.
34848959|a|BACKGROUND: Cerebral small vessel disease is the primary cause of cognitive impairment. Therefore, early recognition is of great significance. Some studies have shown that asymptomatic cerebral small vessel disease (aCSVD) patients have abnormal neurocognitive function, but this is not readily apparent at the initial stage. The objective of this paper was to assess visual spatial attention by event-related potential (ERP) examination and to analyze the relationship between ERP data and clinical characteristics in patients with aCSVD. METHODS: We selected 25 aCSVD patients and enrolled 23 age-matched normal subjects as the control group. We measured the latency and amplitude of original/corresponding differential ERP components using the modified visual oddball paradigm, which included a standard stimulus, target stimulus, and new stimulus. Additionally, we selected aberrant ERP components to study the correlations between the ERP data and clinical characteristics of the patients with aCSVD. RESULTS: We found not only lower amplitude but also significantly longer P3 latency in the aCSVD patients. The above results were further verified by analyzing the different components (target minus standard and novel minus standard) of P3. Furthermore, abnormal ERPs in the aCSVD patients were closely related to the changes observed with imaging. CONCLUSION: It was demonstrated that the speed and capability of processing visual spatial information was impaired in aCSVD patients compared with healthy controls. Thus, ERP examination could detect the presence of attentional deficits and might become a rapid and sensitive method for the early diagnosis of aCSVD. However, its availability needs further investigation.
