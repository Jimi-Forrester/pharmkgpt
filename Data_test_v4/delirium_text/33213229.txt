33213229|a|Renal fibrosis is a common pathological process in the progression of chronic kidney disease. Accumulating evidence suggests that interleukin-17A (IL-17A) and fibrocytes play crucial roles in the pathogenesis of fibrosis. However, the role of IL-17A in the regulation of renal fibrocytes in renal fibrosis has rarely been reported. Here, we report that the plasma IL-17A level is increased in immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) patients and is correlated with clinical parameters. Using a mouse model of unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO), we found that both IL-17A expression and fibrocyte infiltration were increased in the kidneys of UUO mice. Besides, IL-17A enhanced fibrosis and fibrocyte-associated chemokine and activator expression in vitro. Furthermore, inhibition of IL-17A using Am80 (Tamibarotene) decreased fibrocytes and fibrocyte-associated chemokine and activator expression and significantly attenuated renal fibrosis in the UUO mice. Our findings suggest that Am80, which inhibits the accumulation of fibrocytes and alleviates renal fibrosis mediated by IL-17A, maybe a novel therapeutic drug for renal fibrosis.
