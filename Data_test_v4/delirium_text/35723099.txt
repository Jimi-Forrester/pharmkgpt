35723099|t|Including General Audiences in a Virtual Scientific Dementia Conference: Will They Get Anything From It?
35723099|a|BACKGROUND: Study participants, patients, and care partners are key stakeholders in research and have asked for greater inclusion in the dissemination of scientific learning. However, the participation of general audiences in scientific conferences dedicated to Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer's disease related dementias (AD/ADRD) is not widely supported or studied. OBJECTIVE: Our objectives were to evaluate the interest, level of engagement, and impact of including general audiences in a virtual dementia conference. METHODS: A diverse group of lay participants, identified via community-based health advocacy groups and research centers, were invited to attend the 2021 Alzheimer's Association International Conference (AAIC), with optional small-group discussions. Participants received complimentary access to all scientific sessions and were supported via navigation tips, recommended sessions, and a glossary of frequently used terms and acronyms. RESULTS: Lay participants demonstrated a high level of engagement, even among those that were research-naive, attending virtual sessions for an average of 11.7 hours across the five days and recommending a variety of sessions to each other on topics extending from prevention of dementia to new therapies and care. Most participants said they would attend the conference again and rated the quality of interaction as high, while requesting more opportunities to engage directly with researchers. CONCLUSION: General audiences, in particular research participants, are advocating for greater participation in scientific conferences. This program can serve as a model to accomplish inclusion; thereby acknowledging their invaluable contribution to science.
