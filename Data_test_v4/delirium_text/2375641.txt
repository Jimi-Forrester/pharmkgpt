2375641|t|DNA cytosine methylation in brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease.
2375641|a|We developed a novel quantitative assay to test the hypothesis that defects in DNA cytosine methylation might be responsible for the brain chromatin abnormalities and transcriptional alterations observed in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). We found no significant difference in percent methylation of CCGG sites from brain DNA of 44 patients with AD compared with 20 normal subjects. These results, however, would not exclude genomic redistribution of methylcytosine in AD, or disturbed methylation of a limited population of critical brain-specific genes.
