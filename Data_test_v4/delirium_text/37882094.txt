37882094|a|INTRODUCTION: The management of motor fluctuations in Parkinson's disease (PD) can be challenging, and current therapeutic options include the use of monoamine oxidase B inhibitors (MAO-B inhibitors), among others. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of safinamide in the clinical practice carried out in the Toledo Movement Disorders Unit. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective study in which data were collected at baseline and at six months from PD patients who were started on safinamide as an add-on therapy with a stable dose of levodopa in line with standard clinical practice. An analysis was performed by subgroups: patients who were given low-dose safinamide and patients who previously received rasagiline. RESULTS: Ninety patients (47 previously received rasagiline) completed the six-month follow-up. A statistically significant decrease in morning akinesia, nocturnal akinesia, wearing off, unpredictable off phenomenon and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale-III was observed both in those who previously received rasagiline and in those treated with low doses of safinamide. No variation was found in the dyskinesias. The adverse events described were mild, with generalised weakness, dizziness, nausea, headache and alopecia. CONCLUSIONS: Safinamide has been shown to be effective and safe in improving motor fluctuations, motor symptoms and the subjective perception of disease severity in PD patients previously receiving rasagiline and in those receiving low-dose safinamide, all of which is accompanied by a good safety profile.
