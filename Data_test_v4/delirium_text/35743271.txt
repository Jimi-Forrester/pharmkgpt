35743271|a|Neurotrophins, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), are essential for neuronal survival and growth. The signaling cascades initiated by BDNF and its receptor are the key regulators of synaptic plasticity, which plays important role in learning and memory formation. Changes in BDNF levels and signaling pathways have been identified in several neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease, and have been linked with the symptoms and course of these diseases. This review summarizes the current understanding of the role of BDNF in several neurodegenerative diseases, as well as the underlying molecular mechanism. The therapeutic potential of BDNF treatment is also discussed, in the hope of discovering new avenues for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.
