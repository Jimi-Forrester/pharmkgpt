20941349|t|Neuroimaging in delirious intensive care unit patients: a preliminary case series report.
20941349|a|Objective. There exists uncertainty regarding the role of magnetic resonance imaging in the evaluation of intensive care unit delirious patients. This case series describes preliminary magnetic resonance imaging findings obtained because of delirium, subsequent in-hospital clinical decisions, and post-discharge neurocognitive outcomes in intensive care unit survivors.Design. Case series.Setting. Intensive care unit.Participants. Eight patients who underwent magnetic resonance imaging for delirium in the absence of focal neurological findings as part of their intensive care unit clinical care.Measurements. Magnetic resonance imaging findings, clinical decisions following magnetic resonance imaging, and three-month neuropsychological outcomes were obtained.Results. Of the eight patients, six (75%) demonstrated white matter hyperintensities, one (12%) had mild atrophy, and no patient had ischemic/hemorrhagic lesions. Magnetic resonance imaging did not lead to new diagnoses or immediate changes in therapy. All six patients who underwent neuropsychological testing had severe impairments in memory, executive function, and attention at three months, despite the absence of baseline cognitive impairment.Conclusion. Magnetic resonance imaging findings in these delirious intensive care unit patients did not alter the immediate treatment course and these patients had neuropsychological impairments at three months. Future research is warranted to define the role of current and newer magnetic resonance imaging techniques in assessing and managing delirious intensive care unit patients, and to examine relationships between in-hospital magnetic resonance imaging findings (i.e. white matter hyperintensities) and short- and long-term neurological outcomes.
