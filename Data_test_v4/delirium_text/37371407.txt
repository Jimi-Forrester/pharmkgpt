37371407|t|Review of Plant Extracts and Active Components: Mechanisms of Action for the Treatment of Obesity-Induced Cognitive Impairment.
37371407|a|Obesity has been shown to negatively impact cognitive functions, but effective treatments for obesity-induced cognitive impairment are lacking. Natural dietary and plant products, functional foods, and plant-derived compounds have gained attention as potential remedies in part due to the nootropic properties of plants and certain plant-derived agents. This review discusses plant extracts and plant-derived substances that have been shown to ameliorate obesity-induced cognitive impairment in animal models. Mechanistic evaluations of their therapeutic effects are also summarized. A literature search was conducted using PubMed and Google Scholar databases, resulting in the review of 27 English language articles meeting the inclusion criteria. The nine plants (e.g., Ashwagandha, Adzuki bean, and olive) and 18 plant-derived substances (e.g., curcumin, Huperzine A, and Roxburgh's jewel orchid polysaccharides) included in this review improved obesity-induced cognitive impairment through several mechanisms, including attenuation of neuroinflammation, improvement in both central and peripheral insulin resistance, enhancement of neuroprotection and neurogenesis, and modulation of the synthesis and release of cognition-associated neurotransmitters. Based on these findings, plants and plant-derived substances may hold promise for the prevention and treatment of obesity-induced cognitive impairment. Further research is warranted to explore the clinical potential of these plant-derived treatments and to elucidate their underlying molecular mechanisms.
