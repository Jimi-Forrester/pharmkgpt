39438923|t|Analysis of the risk factors for contralateral refracture after hip fracture surgery in elderly individuals: a retrospective study.
39438923|a|BACKGROUND: The risk factors for contralateral hip refracture after primary hip fracture are not fully understood; therefore, this study compared the clinical characteristics of patients with first and second hip fractures and explored and analyzed the risk factors for contralateral refracture after hip fracture in elderly individuals to provide a reference for the clinical prevention of postoperative refracture of hip fracture in elderly individuals. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted on 458 elderly patients with hip fractures who underwent surgical treatment and were discharged from our hospital from March 2016 to March 2019. The clinical data of the patients were analyzed retrospectively. Patients were divided into a case group (postoperative refracture) and a control group (no postoperative refracture) based on whether they experienced refracture within five years after surgery. The clinical data of the two groups were compared and analyzed via univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) regression analysis to identify the risk factors for refractures after hip fracture surgery in elderly patients. RESULTS: Sixty-one patients experienced refracture, with an incidence rate of 13.3%. Age >= 80.5 years, female sex, poor knee joint function, FRAX score >= 15.5, anemia, visual impairment, osteoporosis, and Alzheimer's disease (AD) were identified as risk factors for refracture after hip fracture surgery in elderly individuals (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Elderly patients with hip fractures are susceptible to refracture after surgery because of factors such as advanced age, female sex, high FRAX score, poor knee joint function, anemia, osteoporosis, visual impairment, and AD. Targeted interventions should be implemented based on the above risk factors.
