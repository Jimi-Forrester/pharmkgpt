34917937|a|Purpose: Investigate the feasibility of a non-invasive method to evaluate the physical and cognitive repercussions of long-lasting post-concussion effects in professional combat sports athletes. To help athletes return to professional combat, there is a need for unbiased objective tools and techniques used as a prognostic method of recovery after Sport Related Concussion (SRC). Methods: Six mild Traumatic Brain Injury (mTBI) athletes, age 20 / 43 yr (1 female, 5 males) and 7 not concussed (NC) participants (amateur), age 24 / 38 yr (3 females, 4 males), were tested Inspired/expired gas concentration, Cerebral changes in oxygenated hemoglobin (Delta[HbO2]) and deoxygenated hemoglobin (Delta[HHb]) were measured using near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) with a 3-step protocol: rest before maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) test, hypercapnia, and recovery after VO2max test. The brain oxygenation and respiratory parameters of both sample sets were calculated using a non-parametric test (Mann-Whitney U test). Aerobic fitness outcome was quantified through mean average using the Bruce test. Participants performed Fitt's test using a laptop and analysis of medio-lateral and anterior-posterior range of oscillation was carried out via a force platform Romberg test. Results: mTBI group showed statistically significant differences in saturated hemoglobin Delta[HbO2] (p < 0.001) during rest and recovery phase after maximal incremental exercise, in medio-lateral sway eyes open (p = 0.008, NC 25.35 +- 4.11 mm and mTBI 17.65 +- 4.79 mm). VO2max revealed no significant differences between the two groups: NC 47.47 +- 4.91 mTBI 49.58 +- 5.19 ml/kg/min-1. The 2 groups didn't differ for maximum power output (NC 220 +- 34, mTBI 255 +- 50 W). End-tidal fractional concentration of O2 (FetO2 NC15.20 +- 0.41, mTBI 16.09 +- 0.68) throughout hypercapnia, saturated blood hemoglobin (Delta[HbO2]) revealed significant differences with the mTBI group. No differences emerged from Fitt's test. Conclusions: It emerges that NIRS is able to reveal differences in long time outcomes of mTBI. The medio-lateral variations cannot be considered as a marker of long-term damage in athletes specifically trained for balance.
