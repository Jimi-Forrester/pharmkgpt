32159743|t|A critical role for plasminogen in inflammation.
32159743|a|Plasminogen and its active form, plasmin, have diverse functions related to the inflammatory response in mammals. Due to these roles in inflammation, plasminogen has been implicated in the progression of a wide range of diseases with an inflammatory component. In this review, we discuss the functions of plasminogen in inflammatory regulation and how this system plays a role in the pathogenesis of diseases spanning organ systems throughout the body.
