35805130|t|The Interaction of mTOR and Nrf2 in Neurogenesis and Its Implication in Neurodegenerative Diseases.
35805130|a|Neurogenesis occurs in the brain during embryonic development and throughout adulthood. Neurogenesis occurs in the hippocampus and under normal conditions and persists in two regions of the brain-the subgranular zone (SGZ) in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricles. As the critical role in neurogenesis, the neural stem cells have the capacity to differentiate into various cells and to self-renew. This process is controlled through different methods. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) controls cellular growth, cell proliferation, apoptosis, and autophagy. The transcription factor Nrf2 (nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2) is a major regulator of metabolism, protein quality control, and antioxidative defense, and is linked to neurogenesis. However, dysregulation in neurogenesis, mTOR, and Nrf2 activity have all been associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Huntington's, and Parkinson's. Understanding the role of these complexes in both neurogenesis and neurodegenerative disease could be necessary to develop future therapies. Here, we review both mTOR and Nrf2 complexes, their crosstalk and role in neurogenesis, and their implication in neurodegenerative diseases.
