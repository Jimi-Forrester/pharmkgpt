27736518|t|Recognising delirium.
27736518|a|Delirium is one of the most common acute disorders in general hospitals. It predicts several adverse outcomes including higher length of stay, higher mortality and increased risk of institutionalisation. An episode of delirium is also highly distressing for patients and carers. Recognition can improve the outcome of delirium but it is under-diagnosed in acute hospitals, with 65 to 75 per cent of cases going undetected.
