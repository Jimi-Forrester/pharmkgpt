35640325|a|INTRODUCTION: the COVID-19 pandemic had an impact on hospital admissions. The clinical profiles of patients referred to liaison psychiatry teams (LPT) remained stable over the last few decades. We postulate changes in patient profiles due to the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: a total of 384 patients admitted to a tertiary care University Hospital in Madrid (Spain) and referred to LPTs were recruited. Patients referred 5 months before and after the first admission for COVID-19 were included. Clinical and sociodemographic characteristics were collected, and non-parametric hypothesis contrast tests were used to study possible differences between both periods. RESULTS: patients referred during the pandemic were significantly older (U = 2.006; p = .045), most of them were admitted to medical hospitalization units (chi2 (2) = 5.962; p = 015), and with a different reason for admission. There was an increase in the rate of adjustment disorders (chi2 (1) =7.893; p = 005) and delirium (chi2 (1) =9.413; p = 002), as well as psychiatric comorbidity (chi2 (2) = 9.930; p = .007), and a reduction in the proportion of patients treated for substance misuse (chi2 (5) = 19.152; p = .002). The number of deaths increased significantly (chi2 (1) = 6.611; p = .010). In persons over 65 years inappropriate prescription was significantly lower (chi2 (1) = 8.200; p = .004). CONCLUSIONS: the pandemic had an impact on the activity of the LPTs due to the change in the clinical profile and evolution of referred patients, maintaining standards of care that are reflected through prescription.
