34007333|t|Changes in NSE and S-100beta during the perioperative period and effects on brain injury in infants with biliary atresia undergoing parent donor liver transplantation.
34007333|a|The present study aimed to investigate the effects of parental donor liver transplantation on the perioperative changes of serum calcium-binding protein beta (S-100beta) and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) levels, two markers of brain injury, and on postoperative cognitive function. The present study was a prospective observational study of infants with congenital biliary atresia who underwent selective liver transplantation in 2017 at Tianjin First Central Hospital (Tianjin, China). Blood samples were collected prior to, during and following surgery, and S-100beta and NSE levels were measured using ELISA. The pediatric patients were assessed using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development 1 day prior to and 3 months after surgery. Additionally, the pediatric anesthesia emergence delirium scores were evaluated. The results demonstrated that serum NSE and S100beta were increased during and after surgery compared with prior to surgery (P<0.05). Furthermore, serum S-100beta and NSE levels peaked 1 h after the neohepatic phase compared with prior to surgery (P<0.05). Compared with 1 day before surgery, mental development index (MDI) and psychomotor development index (PDI) were decreased 3 months after surgery (MDI, 87.7+-8.4 vs. 84.5+-8.5, P=0.015; PDI, 82.9+-8.7 vs. 79.6+-8.8, P=0.016). In conclusion, parental donor liver transplantation may cause a certain degree of brain injury in pediatric patients with end-stage liver disease, as revealed by increased serum NSE and S100beta levels.
