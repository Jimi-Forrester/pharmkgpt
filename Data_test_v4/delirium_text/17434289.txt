17434289|t|Comprehensive analysis of APOE and selected proximate markers for late-onset Alzheimer's disease: patterns of linkage disequilibrium and disease/marker association.
17434289|a|The epsilon(4) allele of APOE confers a two- to fourfold increased risk for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD), but LOAD pathology does not all fit neatly around APOE. It is conceivable that genetic variation proximate to APOE contributes to LOAD risk. Therefore, we investigated the degree of linkage disequilibrium (LD) for a comprehensive set of 50 SNPs in and surrounding APOE using a substantial Caucasian sample of 1100 chromosomes. SNPs in APOE were further molecularly haplotyped to determine their phases. One set of SNPs in TOMM40, roughly 15 kb upstream of APOE, showed intriguing LD with the epsilon(4) allele and was strongly associated with the risk for developing LOAD. However, when all the SNPs were entered into a logit model, only the effect of APOE epsilon(4) remained significant. These observations diminish the possibility that loci in the TOMM40 gene may have a major effect on the risk for LOAD in Caucasians.
