37848542|t|The L-proline modified Zr-based MOF (Basu-proline) catalyst for the one-pot synthesis of dihydropyrano[3,2-c]chromenes.
37848542|a|A novel, reusable, and efficient L-proline-modified Zr-based metal-organic framework (Basu-proline) was designed, synthesized, and characterized by Fourier Transform-Infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), Energy-Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), elemental mapping, Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FE-SEM), X-ray Diffraction analysis (XRD), Thermo-Gravimetric-Differential Thermal Analysis (TGA-DTA), and N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms. Then, its catalytic performance was assessed in the synthesis of dihydropyrano[3,2-c]chromenes via the one-pot, three-component tandem condensation reaction of 4-hydroxycoumarin, aromatic aldehydes and malononitrile. The Basu-proline catalyst exhibited a better efficiency than some reported protocols regarding higher yields, lower reaction times, and simple separation.
