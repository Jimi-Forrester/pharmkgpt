35018344|t|Out-of-the-ICU Mobilization in Critically Ill Patients: The Safety of a New Model of Rehabilitation.
35018344|a|OBJECTIVES: Early mobilization of ICU patients has been reported to be safe and feasible. Recently, our ICU implemented out-of-the-ICU wheelchair excursions as a daily rehabilitation practice. The aim of this study is to investigate the safety of participation in the out-of-the-ICU program for early mobilization. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Single general ICU in a tertiary teaching hospital. PATIENTS: Adult patients who were admitted to the ICU and underwent the out-of-the-ICU program as an early mobilization intervention was investigated. INTERVENTIONS: The out-of-the-ICU activities include visiting indoor area, visiting our outdoor garden, and bathing. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Medical records of ICU patients who participated in the out-of-the-ICU program were reviewed. The primary outcome was the occurrence rate of physical safety events, defined as unintentional removal of medical devices, patient agitation, a fall, or an injury. The secondary outcome was the occurrence rate of adverse physiologic changes, defined as hypotension, hypertension, bradycardia, tachycardia, desaturation, bradypnea, tachypnea, an increase in Fio2, or an increase in doses of vasoactive drugs. In total, 99 adult patients participated in the program, comprising a total of 423 out-of-the-ICU sessions. Among them, one session resulted in a physical safety event, the dislodgement of a tracheostomy tube. In 23 sessions, one or two adverse physiologic changes occurred. None of these events required additional treatment nor resulted in serious sequelae. CONCLUSIONS: An out-of-the-ICU program can be provided safely to adult ICU patients, provided that it is supervised by a dedicated intensivist with an appropriately trained multiprofessional staff and equipment on-site. It appears to contribute to the promotion of humanizing intensive care.
