36928887|t|Delirium in older hospitalized patients-A prospective analysis of the detailed course of delirium in geriatric inpatients.
36928887|a|BACKGROUND: Delirium in older hospitalized patients (> 65) is a common clinical syndrome, which is frequently unrecognized. AIMS: We aimed to describe the detailed clinical course of delirium and related cognitive functioning in geriatric patients in a mainly non-postoperative setting in association with demographic and clinical parameters and additionally to identify risk factors for delirium in this common setting. METHODS: Inpatients of a geriatric ward were screened for delirium and in the case of presence of delirium included into the study. Patients received three assessments including Mini-Mental-Status-Examination (MMSE) and the Delirium Rating Scale Revised 98 (DRS-R-98). We conducted correlation and linear mixed-effects model analyses to detect associations. RESULTS: Overall 31 patients (82 years (mean)) met the criteria for delirium and were included in the prospective observational study. Within one week of treatment, mean delirium symptom severity fell below the predefined cut-off. While overall cognitive functioning improved over time, short- and long-term memory deficits remained. Neuroradiological conspicuities were associated with cognitive deficits, but not with delirium severity. DISCUSSION: The temporal stability of some delirium symptoms (short-/long-term memory, language) on the one hand and on the other hand decrease in others (hallucinations, orientation) shown in our study visualizes the heterogeneity of symptoms attributed to delirium and their different courses, which complicates the differentiation between delirium and a preexisting cognitive decline. The recovery from delirium seems to be independent of preclinical cognitive status. CONCLUSION: Treatment of the acute medical condition is associated with a fast decrease in delirium severity. Given the high incidence and prevalence of delirium in hospitalized older patients and its detrimental impact on cognition, abilities and personal independence further research needs to be done.
