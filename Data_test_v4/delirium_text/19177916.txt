19177916|t|[Delirium in the intensive care unit].
19177916|a|Delirium is a common condition in the intensive care unit (ICU). Between 16-89% of all ICU patients experience an episode of delirium during admission. Several detection tools have been developed for use specifically in the ICU. The Confusion Assessment Method for the intensive care unit (CAM-ICU) and the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC) combine high sensitivity with high specificity. Treatment consists of treatment of underlying disorders, nonpharmacological measures and symptomatic drug therapy. The prognosis for ICU patients who experience delirium is worse than for those who do not. Delirious patients are more likely to develop complications, spend longer in hospital and have a higher mortality rate. In view of the high frequency, poor prognosis, high costs and lack of studies into the treatment of ICU delirium, research into the possibilities for prevention, early detection and treatment of the condition is essential.
