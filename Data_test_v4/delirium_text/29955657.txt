29955657|a|INTRODUCTION: Falls are a significant problem among older adults with Alzheimer's disease, leading to high rates of fracture, hospitalization, and death. Tracking falls in older adults, particularly those with cognitive impairment, is a clinical and research challenge. METHODS: This prospective pilot study evaluated the feasibility of a text message program to track falls among patients with dementia. We also compared this technique with the calendar method of fall data collection. RESULTS: There was a 96% completion rate of text messaging and 100% of calendars; however, the text-gathered data were more accurate. DISCUSSION: A text-messaging platform to track falls shows promise in cognitively impaired individuals.
