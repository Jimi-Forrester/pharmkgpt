34338885|a|INTRODUCTION: Recently, the Cobra prostheses were introduced in the treatment of distal radius fractures (DRF) of elderly patients. Fracture prostheses provide an alternative treatment option for complex fractures where conservative therapy seems not acceptable and osteosynthesis seems not possible. Data reporting the feasibility of the Cobra prosthesis are sparse. Therefore, this retrospective follow-up study investigated the clinical and radiological mid-term outcome of the Cobra implant in complex DRFs of elderly patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirteen patients (mean age 73.5 years, range 65-87 years) were retrospectively evaluated with at least a 1-year follow-up after surgery. Objective and subjective clinical parameters as well as the radiological outcome and complications were analyzed. RESULTS: The mean follow-up period was 31.2 months. Seven cases required a cemented prosthesis. The mean relative range-of-motion compared to the healthy side was 72.3% and 51.8% for extension and flexion, respectively, and 87.9% and 85.7% for pronation and supination, respectively. The mean grip strength was 78.3% compared to the non-operated side. Eight patients were very satisfied, five patients were partly satisfied with the result. The DASH, PRWE, MHQ and Lyon-Scores averaged 39.1, 36.2, 64.9 and 63.3 points, respectively. The mean VAS-Score for pain was 1.1 at rest and 3.2 during activities. Perioperative complications included one dissection of the extensor pollicis longus tendon, one heterotopic ossification, one radiocarpal dislocation and two cases of an ulnar impaction syndrome due to implant subsidence. CONCLUSION: The prosthetic treatment of complex DRFs in elderly patients with the Cobra implant led to clinically and radiologically satisfactory mid-term results. The Cobra prosthesis still does not represent a gold standard but can be regarded as a feasible salvage option for complex DRFs when osteosyntheses may not be possible and non-operative treatment will lead to further functional restrictions and wrist pain during performing activities of daily life in high functional demand patients.
