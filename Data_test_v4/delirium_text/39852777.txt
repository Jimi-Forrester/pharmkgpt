39852777|a|Huntington's disease (HD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder for which, until now, only symptomatic treatment has been available. Lately, there have been multiple ongoing clinical trials targeting therapeutic agents for preventing disease onset or slowing disease progression in HD. These studies are in constant need of reliable biomarkers for neurodegeneration in HD. In recent years, retinal biomarkers have attracted significant attention in neurodegenerative disorders. Likewise, optical coherence tomography (OCT) is being evaluated as a potential biomarker in HD. In this article, we review the existing literature on OCT as a biomarker for neurodegeneration in HD.
