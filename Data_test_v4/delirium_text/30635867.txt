30635867|a|Studies have associated electroencephalogram (EEG) suppression with postoperative delirium (POD) and postoperative cognitive decline (POCD). Otherwise, improving cerebral tissue oxygen saturation (rScO2) seems beneficial. No study has evaluated the impact of EEG suppression and decreased rScO2 on the incidence of POD and POCD when the intraoperative management of patients is performed with a depth-of-anesthesia (DOA) monitor and a cerebral oximetry. In this prospective study patients undergoing cardiac interventions were monitored with the NeuroSENSE  DOA monitor and bilateral cerebral oximetry. An algorithm was used to optimize cerebral oxygenation. EEG suppression was presented as total area under the curve (AUC) of suppression ratio (SR) > 0 s (AUCEEGSR>0s). Cerebral desaturation was defined as AUC of 25% drop of oximetry values as compared to baseline. POD was evaluated by the chart review method. POCD was defined as a Z-score <= 2 based on Mini Mental State Examination at baseline and day 5 or if the patient reported any cognitive decline at 3 and at 6 months postoperatively. Among the 1616 patients, 1513 underwent normothermic surgery and were further analyzed. POD and POCD were respectively evaluated in 1504 and 1350 patients of whom 303 (20%) and 270 (20%) were respectively diagnosed positive. Having experienced high magnitudes of EEG suppression (fourth quartile of AUCEEGSR>0s) was significantly associated with POD (OR = 2.247; 95% CI = 1.414-3.571; P = 0.001). Low rScO2 at the end of surgery was statistically associated with POCD (OR = 0.981; 95% CI = 0.965-0.997; P = 0.018). The results of our study show that the degree of intraoperative EEG suppression on one hand, and low rScO2 at the end of procedure on the other hand, are associated with respectively POD and POCD in patients undergoing cardiac interventions.
