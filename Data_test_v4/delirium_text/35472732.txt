35472732|a|INTRODUCTION: The nature and course of limitations in everyday function in the early clinical stages of cognitive decline is not well known. METHODS: We compared complex everyday functional profiles at baseline in 59 community-dwelling older individuals with normal cognitive performance who went on to develop incident mild cognitive impairment (MCI) ("pre-MCI") with 284 older individuals who remained cognitively normal over follow-up. RESULTS: The mean number of limitations on complex everyday function at baseline was 3.1 +- 3.0 in the 59 pre-MCI cases and 2.0 +- 2.4 in the 284 normal controls (P = .003). Pre-MCI cases had limitations in traveling, entertaining, remembering appointments, and hobbies compared to normal controls. A progressive increase in mild limitations on complex everyday function preceded the incidence of MCI (mean change: pre-MCI 1.9 +- 3.6 vs normal controls 0.5 +- 2.7, P < .001). DISCUSSION: Prodromal stages of MCI are associated with progressive mild limitations in complex activities of daily living.
