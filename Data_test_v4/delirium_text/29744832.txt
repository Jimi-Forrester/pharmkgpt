29744832|t|Nanoparticle Tracking for Protein Aggregation Research.
29744832|a|Protein aggregates are the pathological agents in several neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Huntington's disease. In the pharmaceutical industry, protein aggregation poses significant challenges to the manufacture of biologics. Nanoparticle tracking is an emerging technology that allows particle-by-particle measurement of aggregate size and concentration. The technique is solution based, and requires no labeling. Here we describe protocols for using nanoparticle tracking in protein aggregation research, and provide a few examples for illustrative purposes.
