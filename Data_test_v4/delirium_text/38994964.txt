38994964|t|Oligodendrocyte Dysfunction in Tauopathy: A Less Explored Area in Tau-Mediated Neurodegeneration.
38994964|a|Aggregation of the microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) is the hallmark pathology in a spectrum of neurodegenerative disorders collectively called tauopathies. Physiologically, tau is an inherent neuronal protein that plays an important role in the assembly of microtubules and axonal transport. However, disease-associated mutations of this protein reduce its binding to the microtubule components and promote self-aggregation, leading to formation of tangles in neurons. Tau is also expressed in oligodendrocytes, where it has significant developmental roles in oligodendrocyte maturation and myelin synthesis. Oligodendrocyte-specific tau pathology, in the form of fibrils and coiled coils, is evident in major tauopathies including progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), corticobasal degeneration (CBD), and Pick's disease (PiD). Multiple animal models of tauopathy expressing mutant forms of MAPT recapitulate oligodendroglial tau inclusions with potential to cause degeneration/malfunction of oligodendrocytes and affecting the neuronal myelin sheath. Till now, mechanistic studies heavily concentrated on elucidating neuronal tau pathology. Therefore, more investigations are warranted to comprehensively address tau-induced pathologies in oligodendrocytes. The present review provides the current knowledge available in the literature about the intricate relations between tau and oligodendrocytes in health and diseases.
