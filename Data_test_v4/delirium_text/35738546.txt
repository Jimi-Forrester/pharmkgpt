35738546|t|Therapeutic nanotechnologies for Alzheimer's disease: A critical analysis of recent trends and findings.
35738546|a|Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is an irreversible neurodegenerative disease for which no modifying therapies are presently available. Besides the identification of pathological targets, AD presents numerous clinical and pharmacological challenges such as efficient active delivery to the central nervous system, cell targeting, and long-term dosing. Nanoparticles have been explored to overcome some of these challenges as drug delivery vehicles or drugs themselves. However, early promises have failed to materialize as no nanotechnology-based product has been able to reach the market and very few have moved past preclinical stages. In this review, we perform a critical analysis of the past decade's research on nanomedicine-based therapies for AD at the preclinical and clinical stages. The main obstacles to nanotechnology products and the most promising approaches were also identified, including renewed promise with gene editing, gene modulation, and vaccines.
