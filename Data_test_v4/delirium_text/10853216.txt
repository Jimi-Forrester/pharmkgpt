10853216|t|Pethidine reverses morphine-induced delirium.
10853216|a|A young patient had unexpected and prolonged postoperative delirium apparently associated with morphine-induced biliary colic. Naloxone had no therapeutic effect, but a small dose of pethidine produced a dramatic return to lucidity. Unrecognized biliary spasm should be considered as a cause of agitation in the recovery room in postoperative patients who have received morphine.
