20553303|t|The role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of delirium and dementia in older adults: a review.
20553303|a|AIMS: To review recent evidence that suggests inflammation plays a similar role in the pathogenesis of delirium and dementia. METHODS: We performed a literature search of original research and review articles in PubMed using the keywords: delirium, dementia, and inflammation. We summarized the evidence linking inflammation to the pathogenesis of delirium and dementia. DISCUSSION: Delirium and dementia share similarities in clinical and pathogenic features, leading to the speculation that instead of being distinct clinical entities, the two age-related conditions may be linked by a common pathogenic mechanism. Inflammatory markers have been shown to be elevated in both delirium and dementia, thereby implicating inflammation as a possible mediating factor in their genesis. There is evidence in both basic science and clinical research literature that elevated cytokines play a crucial role in the development of cognitive dysfunction observed in both dementia and delirium. CONCLUSION: Mounting evidence supports the role of inflammation in the development of both dementia and delirium. Further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying these relationships.
