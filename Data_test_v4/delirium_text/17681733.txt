17681733|a|Studies aimed at collecting reference parameters for haematochemical analysis in the elderly are scarce and for the oldest old subjects even more rare. In order to establish the reference values for the most common laboratory text in long living individuals, we measured haematochemical parameters in >100 years old subjects and in aged subjects as control. Six hundred and two centenarians accepted to be enrolled in the study. A case history containing the complete anamnesis, clinical examinations, evaluation of the clinical cognitive and functional tests, was prepared for each centenarian. Blood samples from 120>100 years old subjects free of chronic or acute Illness (i.e. Alzheimer's disease, metabolic diseases, cardiovascular disease, stroke, neoplastic and infectious diseases) were analysed. A population of 381 healthy old subjects (age range 65-85 years old), recruited in the same geographic areas and with the same clinical characteristic of the health centenarians, was utilized as control. Significant differences were observed for blood glucose, ALT, cholesterol and platelet levels, reduced in centenarians respect to the old subjects, whereas blood urea nitrogen levels were found significantly increased in centenarians. In conclusion, reference values of the healthy adults can generally been utilized also for the healthy oldest old group, with the notable exception of the above mentioned laboratory parameters that appear to be modified in long living subjects.
