36334623|a|Human Tnk1 (thirty-eight negative kinase 1) is a member of the Ack family of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases. Tnk1 contains a sterile alpha motif, a tyrosine kinase catalytic domain, an SH3 (Src homology 3) domain, and a large C-terminal region that contains a ubiquitin association domain. However, specific physiological roles for Tnk1 have not been characterized in depth. Here, we expressed and purified Tnk1 from Sf9 insect cells and established an in vitro assay system using a peptide substrate derived from the Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Protein (WASP). By Tnk1 expression in mammalian cells, we found that the N-terminal SAM domain is important for self-association and kinase activity. We also studied a fusion protein, originally discovered in a Hodgkin's Lymphoma cell line, that contains an unrelated sequence from the C17ORF61 gene fused to the C-terminus of Tnk1. Cells expressing the fusion protein showed increased tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular substrates relative to cells expressing WT Tnk1. A truncated Tnk1 construct (residues 1-465) also showed enhanced phosphorylation, indicating that the C17ORF61 sequence was dispensable for the effect. Additionally, in vitro kinase assays with the WASP peptide substrate showed no increase in intrinsic Tnk1 activity in C-terminally truncated constructs, suggesting that the truncations did not simply remove an autoinhibitory element. Fluorescence microscopy experiments demonstrated that the C-terminus of Tnk1 plays an important role in the subcellular localization of the kinase. Taken together, our data suggest that the noncatalytic regions of Tnk1 play important roles in governing activity and substrate phosphorylation.
