29887887|t|Falls in Older Patients with Cancer Undergoing Surgery: Prevalence and Association with Geriatric Syndromes and Levels of Disability Assessed in Preoperative Evaluation.
29887887|a|Falls are common among older adults. However, not much is known about the prevalence of falls among older patients with cancer. In 2015, older patients with cancer referred to Geriatrics service for preoperative evaluation were assessed for fall history, basic and instrumental activities of daily living (ADL and IADL), KPS, and use of assistive device. Of 806 patients, 215 (26.7%) patients reported fall. Incidence of last fall inside and outside home was 54.4% and 45.5%, respectively. Among patients with no falls, 33.6% had KPS <= 80 compared to 59.6% with one-time fall and 60.7% with multiple falls (p < 0.001). Among IADL, 8.5% of patients with no falls were unable to do shopping compared with 14.7% in one-time fall and 18.8% in multiple fallers (p < 0.001). In ADL items, the percentage of patients who were limited a lot in walking outside was 10.7% in no falls, 20.2% in one-time fall, and 27.1% in multiple fallers groups (p < 0.001). Only 17.8% of patients with no falls were using canes while 27.7% of patients with one-time fall and 38.8% with multiple falls were using canes (p < 0.001). Falls are prevalent among older patients with cancer. Fall history and number of falls are associated with functional status.
