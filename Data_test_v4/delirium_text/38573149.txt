38573149|t|[Cortico-basal syndrome and cortico-basal degeneration: From the clinical diagnosis to the lesional substrate for an adapted care].
38573149|a|Cortico-basal degeneration is a relatively uncommon cause of degenerative parkinsonism in the elderly. From a clinical point of view, it manifests as a cortico-basal syndrome (CBS), featuring a highly asymmetrical akinetic-rigid syndrome, dystonia, myoclonus and cognitive-behavioral impairment with predominant apraxia. Other clinical phenotypes are possible, including variants with mainly language or behavioral impairment, or with axial, symmetrical parkinsonism resembling progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). Current diagnostic criteria take into account the heterogeneity of clinical presentations. However, a diagnosis of certainty can only be reached by a pathological study, with the evidence of TAU-positive intraneuronal inclusions. Indeed SCB may be underpinned by other lesional substrates, ranging from frontotemporal degeneration to Alzheimer's disease. Symptom management must be early, multidisciplinary and adapted to the progression of the disorder. The identification of the pathological substrate is an essential prerequisite for pathophysiological therapeutic trials.
