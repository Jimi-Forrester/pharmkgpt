38663285|t|Design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of some 2-(3-oxo-5,6-diphenyl-1,2,4-triazin-2(3H)-yl)-N-phenylacetamide hybrids as MTDLs for Alzheimer's disease therapy.
38663285|a|Inspite of established symptomatic relief drug targets, a multi targeting approach is highly in demand to cure Alzheimer's disease (AD). Simultaneous inhibition of cholinesterase (ChE), beta secretase-1 (BACE-1) and Dyrk1A could be promising in complete cure of AD. A series of 18 diaryl triazine based molecular hybrids were successfully designed, synthesized, and tested for their hChE, hBACE-1, Dyrk1A and Abeta aggregation inhibitory potentials. Compounds S-11 and S-12 were the representative molecules amongst the series with multi-targeted inhibitory effects. Compound S-12 showed hAChE inhibition (IC50 value = 0.486 +- 0.047 muM), BACE-1 inhibition (IC50 value = 0.542 +- 0.099 muM) along with good anti-Abeta aggregation effects in thioflavin-T assay. Only compound S-02 of the series has shown Dyrk1A inhibition (IC50 value = 2.000 +- 0.360 muM). Compound S-12 has also demonstrated no neurotoxic liabilities against SH-SY5Y as compared to donepezil. The in vivo behavioral studies of the compound S-12 in the scopolamine- and Abeta-induced animal models also demonstrated attanuation of learning and memory functions in rats models having AD-like characteristics. The ex vivo studies, on the rat hippocampal brain demonstrated reduction in certain biochemical markers of the AD brain with a significant increase in ACh level. The Western blot and Immunohistochemistry further revealed lower tau, APP and BACE-1 molecular levels. The drosophilla AD model also revealed improved eyephenotype after treatment with compound S-12. The molecular docking studies of the compounds suggested that compound S-12 was interacting with the ChE-PAS & CAS residues and catalytic dyad residues of the BACE-1 enzymes. The 100 ns molecular dynamics simulation studies of the ligand-protein complexed with hAChE and hBACE-1 also suggested stable ligand-protein confirmation throughout the simulation run.
