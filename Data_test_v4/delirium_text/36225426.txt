36225426|t|Long-Term Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Stays Can Lead to Long-Term Cognitive Impairment (LTCI): Neurosurgery Nursing Strategies to Minimize Risk.
36225426|a|Long-term cognitive impairment (LTCI) is a phenomenon predominantly seen in patients within intensive care units (ICU) that causes chronic dysfunction, defined as new or worsening deficits in memory, attention, mental processing speed, executive function, intellectual function, and visual-spatial abilities for over 12 months, inhibiting the necessary return to baseline function without appropriate intervention. Our objective is to provide a guideline of nursing strategies to reduce LTCI through different studies that evaluate pharmacological and non-pharmacological methods. Current literature demonstrates that pharmacotherapy focused on neuronal protection as well as robust physical therapy regimens and regulated sleep schedules show promise in strengthening cognitive function and reducing LTCI. Future studies regarding LTCI should focus on the efficacy of specific pharmacological regimens, large-scale assessments of the implementation of physical therapy to reduce LTCI, as well as, specific interventions to reduce the incidence of delirium in the ICU.
