37802695|t|The efficacy of earplugs and eye masks for delirium severity and sleep quality in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting in cardiac intensive care units: A single-blind, randomised controlled trial.
37802695|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Delirium is a neuropsychiatric syndrome with a wide range of possible causes and multiple complications in patients admitted to intensive care units. It is, therefore, necessary to seek appropriate and safe strategies to prevent and manage delirium. This study is intended to examine the efficacy of eye masks and earplugs for delirium severity and sleep quality in patients with coronary artery bypass grafting in a cardiac intensive care unit. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This single-blind, randomised controlled trial was conducted on 114 patients who were consecutively enrolled and randomly assigned to either the experimental group or the control group. The experimental group received routine care plus eye masks and earplugs, and the control group received only routine care. The delirium severity and sleep quality were measured with the Neelon and Champagne confusion scale and the Verran and Snyder-Halpern sleep scale. RESULTS: The mean delirium severity score differed significantly between the two groups on the second, third, and fourth postoperative days (p < 0.001). Although the trend of changes in the mean delirium severity score from the first postoperative day (before the intervention) to the second, third, and fourth postoperative days was downward in the two groups (trending towards higher delirium severity), the control group experienced greater changes than the experimental group. An intragroup analysis of delirium severity detected a statistically significant difference in both the experimental and control groups (p < 0.001). The sleep quality domains (sleep disturbance, sleep effectiveness, sleep supplementation) showed a statistically significant difference between the two groups across the three intervention days (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The overnight use of eye masks and earplugs were found to have positive effects on sleep quality domains (sleep disturbance, sleep effectiveness, sleep supplementation) and delirium severity in coronary artery bypass grafting patients admitted to the cardiac intensive care unit for several days. It was also found that a significant interaction effect between the sleep disturbance subscale and delirium severity exists.
