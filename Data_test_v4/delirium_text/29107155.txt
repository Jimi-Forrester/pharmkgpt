29107155|t|The blood-brain interface: a culture change.
29107155|a|The blood-brain interface (BBI) is the subject of a new named series at Brain, Behavior, and Immunity. It is timely to reflect on a number of advances in the field within the last ten years, which may lead to an increased understanding of human behaviour and a wide range of psychiatric and neurological conditions. We cover discoveries made in solute and cell trafficking, endothelial cell and pericyte biology, extracellular matrix and emerging tools, especially those which will enable study of the human BBI. We now recognize the central role of the BBI in a number of immunopsychiatric syndromes, including sickness behaviour, delirium, septic encephalopathy, cognitive side effects of cytokine-based therapies and the frank psychosis observed in neuronal surface antibody syndromes. In addition, we find ourselves interrogating and modulating the brain across the BBI, during diagnostic investigation and treatment of brain disease. The past ten years of BBI research have been exciting but there is more to come.
