31887353|a|BACKGROUND: Previous studies have reported that exercise could improve the plasticity of hippocampal synapses. However, the effects of exercise on synapses in the hippocampus in Alzheimer's disease (AD) are not completely known. METHODS: In this study, thirty 12-month-old male APP/PS1 double transgenic mice were randomly divided into a sedentary group (n = 15) and a running group (n = 15). Fifteen 12-month-old male wild-type littermates were assigned to the control group (n = 15). While running mice were assigned to treadmill running for four months, the control mice and sedentary mice did not run during the study period. After Morris water maze testing, five mice in each group were randomly selected for a stereological assessment of spinophilin-immunoreactive puncta in the CA1, CA2-3 and dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus. RESULTS: Morris water maze testing revealed that while the learning and memory abilities in sedentary APP/PS1 mice were significantly worse than those in wild-type control mice, the learning and memory abilities in running APP/PS1 mice were significantly better than those in sedentary APP/PS1 mice. The stereological results showed that the spinophilin-immunoreactive puncta numbers of the CA1, CA2-3 and DG in the hippocampus of sedentary APP/PS1 mice were significantly lower than those of wild-type control mice and that the numbers of these spines in the CA1, CA2-3 and DG in the hippocampus of running APP/PS1 mice were significantly higher than those of sedentary APP/PS1 mice. Moreover, a running-induced improvement in spatial learning and memory abilities was significantly correlated with running-induced increases in the spinophilin-immunoreactive puncta numbers in the CA1 and DG of the hippocampus. CONCLUSIONS: Four-month treadmill exercise induced a significant improvement in spatial learning and memory abilities and a significant increase in the number of spinophilin-immunoreactive puncta of the CA1, CA2-3 and DG in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice. Running-induced improvements in spatial learning and memory abilities were significantly correlated with running-induced increases in the spinophilin-immunoreactive puncta numbers in the CA1 and DG of the hippocampus.
