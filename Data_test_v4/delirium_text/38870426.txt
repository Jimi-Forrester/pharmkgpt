38870426|t|Abnormal Insula Network Characteristics in Panic Disorder.
38870426|a|BACKGROUND: Panic disorder (PD) is a common disabling condition characterized by recurrent panic attacks. Emotional and behavioral impairments are associated with functional connectivity (FC) and network abnormalities. We used the whole brain FC, modular networks, and graph-theory analysis to investigate extensive network profiles in PD. METHOD: The functional MRI data from 82 PD and 97 controls were included. Intrinsic FC between each pair of 160 regions, 6 intra-networks, and 15 inter-networks were analyzed. The topological properties were explored. RESULTS: PD patients showed altered FCs within the right insula, between frontal cortex-posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), frontal cortex-cerebellum, and PCC-occipital cortex (corrected P values < 0.001). Lower connections within the Sensorimotor Network (SMN) and SMN-Occipital Network (OCN) were detected (P values < 0.05). Various decreased global and local network features were found in PD (P values < 0.05). In addition, significant correlations were found between PD symptoms and nodal efficiency (Ne) in the insula (r = -0.273, P = 0.016), and the FC of the intra-insula (r = -0.226, P = 0.041). CONCLUSIONS: PD patients present with abnormal functional brain networks, especially the decreased FC and Ne within insula, suggesting that dysfunction of information integration plays an important role in PD.
