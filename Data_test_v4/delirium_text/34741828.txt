34741828|a|Long-term care and supportive living (LTC/SL) residents are among the most at risk for severe outcomes of COVID-19. As such, early public health measures focused on this population. This study examined the experiences and perspectives of residents and family members of residents living in LTC/SL centres in Alberta, Canada during the COVID-19 pandemic. Between July and October 2020, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 14 residents and 18 family members of residents from 10 centres. Interviews were audio-recorded and analyzed using qualitative content analysis. Analysis revealed 5 categories from resident interviews (Living with Rules and Restrictions; COVID-19 Knowledge and Information; Wellbeing; Centre Operational Response; Criticisms and Suggestions for Improvement) and 6 categories from family interviews (Family Role; Navigating the New Normal; COVID-19 Knowledge and Information; Policy Limitations; Policy Impact; Centre Response). The results highlight the importance of engaging residents and families during pandemic preparation, response, and follow-up evaluation.
