This frequently occurs in vulnerability, isolation, and depression, which then have a poor impact on other health-related factors. A number of health problems, including a higher risk of cardio problems, are brought on by social isolation and loneliness. Electrocardiogram (ECG) usage for mental condition recognition enables accurate determination of a person's internal representation. The electrocardiogram (ECG) signals can be thoroughly analyzed to uncover hidden data that may be helpful for the precise identification of cardiac problems. ECG time-series information typically have great dimensions and complicated componentry. Using relevant information to guide training is among the main achievements of this type of learning. An ECG signal plays a significant part in the individual body's ability to manage behavior. Furthermore, loneliness identification is crucial since it has the worse effect on the circumstances that afflict persons. This study suggested an approach for detecting loneliness from an ECG signal to use a variable auto encoder-based optimization algorithm for ESN technique. The suggested approach consists of three phases for identifying a person's loneliness. Firstly, undecimated discrete wavelet transform is used to preprocess the acquired ECG data. Next, further characteristics are extracted from the precompiled signals using a variable auto encoder. For the precise categorization of loneliness in the ECG signal, a metaheuristic optimized ESN is, therefore, presented. The outcomes of the tests demonstrate that the suggested system with suitable ECG representations produces improved accuracy as well as performance.
