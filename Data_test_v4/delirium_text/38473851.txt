38473851|t|Silver and Gold Complexes with NHC-Ligands Derived from Caffeine: Catalytic and Pharmacological Activity.
38473851|a|N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) silver(I) and gold(I) complexes have found different applications in various research fields, as in medicinal chemistry for their antiproliferative, anticancer, and antibacterial activity, and in chemistry as innovative and effective catalysts. The possibility of modulating the physicochemical properties, by acting on their ligands and substituents, makes them versatile tools for the development of novel metal-based compounds, mostly as anticancer compounds. As it is known, chemotherapy is commonly adopted for the clinical treatment of different cancers, even though its efficacy is hampered by several factors. Thus, the development of more effective and less toxic drugs is still an urgent need. Herein, we reported the synthesis and characterization of new silver(I) and gold(I) complexes stabilized by caffeine-derived NHC ligands, together with their biological and catalytic activities. Our data highlight the interesting properties of this series as effective catalysts in A3-coupling and hydroamination reactions and as promising anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant agents. The ability of these complexes in regulating different pathological aspects, and often co-promoting causes, of cancer makes them ideal leads to be further structurally functionalized and investigated.
