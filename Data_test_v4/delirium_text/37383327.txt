37383327|a|Objectives: Investigate opioid usage and postoperative pain in patients undergoing head and neck free flap surgery. Methods: A retrospective review of 100 consecutive patients undergoing head and neck free flap reconstruction at two academic centers was performed. Data captured included demographics, postoperative inpatient pain, pain at postoperative visits, morphine equivalent doses (MEDs) administration, medication history, and comorbidities. Data were analyzed using regression models, chi 2 tests, and student's t-tests. Results: Seventy-three percent of patients were discharged with opioid medication, with over half (53.4%) continuing to take opioids at their second postoperative visit, and over one-third (34.2%) continuing to take them around 4-month postoperatively. One out of every five (20.3%) opioid-naive patients chronically took opioids postoperatively. There was a poor association between inpatient postoperative pain scores and daily MEDs administered (R 2 = 0.13, 0.17, and 0.22 in postoperative Days 3, 5, and 7, respectively). Neither preoperative radiotherapy nor postoperative complications were associated with an increase in opioid usage. Conclusions: For patients undergoing head and neck free flap operations, opioid medications are commonly used for postoperative analgesia. This practice may increase the chance an opioid-naive patient uses opioids chronically. We found a poor association between MEDs administered and patient-reported pain scores, which suggests that standardized protocols aimed at optimizing analgesia while reducing opioid administration may be warranted. Level of Evidence: 3 (Retrospective cohort study).
