29273951|a|Neuroinflammatory responses in Alzheimer's disease (AD) are complex and not fully understood. They involve various cellular and molecular players and associate interaction between the central nervous system (CNS) and the periphery. Amyloid peptides within the senile plaques and abnormally phosphorylated tau in neurofibrillary tangles are able to initiate inflammatory responses, in brain of AD patients and in mouse models of this disease. The outcome of these responses on the pathophysiology of AD depends on several factors and can be either beneficial or detrimental. Thus, understanding the role of neuroinflammation in AD could help to develop safer and more efficient therapeutic strategies. This review discusses recent knowledge on microglia responses toward amyloid and tau pathology in AD, focusing on the role of Toll-like receptors and NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation in microglial cells.
