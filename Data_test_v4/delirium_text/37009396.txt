37009396|a|Objective: In recent years, the use of a ketogenic diet (KD) against obesity has gained popularity in KSA. This study was designed to determine the impact of KD on anthropometric indices and on the abnormal regulation of inflammatory activities in obese Saudi women. Moreover, we investigated the potential of beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) supplementation on the inhibition of pro-inflammatory activities. Methods: We enrolled 31 Saudi women (aged, 35.3 +- 8.4 years) with an average BMI of 33.96 +- 4.44 kg/m2 underwent an 8-week KD (8KD) from January to March 2021. Changes in anthropometric measurements were collected at baseline and after 4-8 weeks of intervention. Compliance with the dietary regimen was monitored weekly by plasma BHB level. Results: Twenty-nine females commenced the diets and 23 completed the study (a 79% completion rate). In comparison to pre-intervention, the 8KD resulted in a significant increase in the levels of plasma BHB (P < 0.001) throughout the duration of the trial. This was accompanied by a significant reduction in weight loss (7.7 kg +- 11.3; P < 0.001), BMI, waist circumference (P < 0.001), and levels of the inflammatory cytokine IL-1beta (P < 0.001). Conclusions: An 8-week KD was found to be useful in producing a positive impact on anthropometric indices, biochemical and inflammatory processes. This study indicated that the intake of a KD by obese Saudi women induced the release of BHB in the blood without stimulation of an overall starvation response. This may be useful to alleviate the severity of chronic inflammatory disorders associated with obesity.
