31393389|t|Manganese levels and hepatocellular carcinoma: A systematic review and meta-analysis based on Asian cohort.
31393389|a|Several studies have investigated the relationship between Manganese (Mn) levels and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but the results were inconsistent. Thus, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the association between Mn levels and HCC. Nine studies focusing on hair Mn levels, 6 studies on serum Mn levels and 6 studies on tissue Mn levels were identified in a systematic search of PubMed, CNKI, Wanfang and SinoMed databases. Standard mean differences (SMD) with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) were pooled to compare the Mn levels between HCC and controls. In serum, the Mn levels in HCC were significantly lower than in healthy controls (SMD (95% CI): -0.941 (-1.559, -0.323)). In hair, the Mn levels in HCC were slightly lower than in healthy controls, but not significant (SMD (95% CI): -0.168 (-0.766, 0.430)). In tissue, the Mn levels in tumors were significantly lower than in adjacent normal tissues (SMD (95% CI): -4.867 (-7.143, -2.592)). Subgroup analysis showed consistent results. In conclusion, this meta-analysis suggested an inverse association between Mn levels and HCC.
