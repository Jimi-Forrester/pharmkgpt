33675779|t|The interplay between lipid and Abeta amyloid homeostasis in Alzheimer's Disease: risk factors and therapeutic opportunities.
33675779|a|Alzheimer's Diseases (AD) is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid deposits of Abeta peptide in the brain. Besides genetic background, the presence of other diseases and an unhealthy lifestyle are known risk factors for AD development. Albeit accumulating clinical evidence suggests that an impaired lipid metabolism is related to Abeta deposition, mechanistic insights on the link between amyloid fibril formation/clearance and aberrant lipid interactions are still unavailable. Recently, many studies have described the key role played by membrane bound Abeta assemblies in neurotoxicity. Moreover, it has been suggested that a derangement of the ubiquitin proteasome pathway and autophagy is significantly correlated with toxic Abeta aggregation and dysregulation of lipid levels. Thus, studies focusing on the role played by lipids in Abeta aggregation and proteostasis could represent a promising area of investigation for the design of valuable treatments. In this review we examine current knowledge concerning the effects of lipids in Abeta aggregation and degradation processes, focusing on the therapeutic opportunities that a comprehensive understanding of all biophysical, biochemical, and biological processes involved may disclose.
