29889072|a|We have recently shown that the tocotrienol-rich fraction (TRF) of palm oil, a mixture of vitamin E analogs, improves amyloid pathology in vitro and in vivo. However, precise mechanisms remain unknown. In this study, we examined the effects of long-term (10 months) TRF treatment on behavioral impairments and brain metabolites in (15 months old) AbetaPP/PS1 double transgenic (Tg) Alzheimer's disease (AD) mice. The open field test, Morris water maze, and novel object recognition tasks revealed improved exploratory activity, spatial learning, and recognition memory, respectively, in TRF-treated Tg mice. Brain metabolite profiling of wild-type and Tg mice treated with and without TRF was performed using ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) coupled to high-resolution accurate mass (HRAM)-orbitrap tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). Metabolic pathway analysis found perturbed metabolic pathways that linked to AD. TRF treatment partly ameliorated metabolic perturbations in Tg mouse hippocampus. The mechanism of this pre-emptive activity may occur via modulation of metabolic pathways dependent on Abeta interaction or independent of Abeta interaction.
