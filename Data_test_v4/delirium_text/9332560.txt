9332560|t|[Clinical and laboratory changes before the development of delirium tremens].
9332560|a|Thirteen alcoholic male patients that developed delirium tremens (DT) after admission in a psychiatric hospital for treatment of alcoholism (group I) had their clinical and laboratorial records examined. The laboratory samples were taken during the phase previous at the DT. Data on this group were compared to those of two other groups of alcoholics--26 patients each--that did not develop DT in the present admission, with (group II) or without (group III) previous history of DT. The patients of group I had significantly lower average age and worse general conditions than the patients of group III. The frequency of elevated aminotransferases and hypomagnesemia was significantly higher in the group I and II than in the group III. The aminotransferases, especially the aspartate-aminotransferase, were significantly more elevated in the groups I and II.
