30421523|a|The remodelling of structural and functional neurovascular unit (NVU) becomes a central therapeutic strategy after cerebral ischaemic stroke. In the present study, we investigated the effect of combined therapy of sodium ferulate (SF), n-butylidenephthalide (BP) and adipose-derived stromal cells (ADSCs) to ameliorate the injured NVU in the photochemically induced thrombotic stroke in rats. After solely or combined treatment, the neovascularization, activation of astrocytes, neurogenesis, expressions of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and claudin-5 were assessed by immunohistochemical or immunofluorescence staining. In order to uncover the underlying mechanism of therapeutic effect, signalling of protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin (AKT/mTOR), extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), and Notch1 in infarct zone were analysed by western blot. 18 F-2-deoxy-glucose/positron emission tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, Evans blue staining were employed to evaluate the glucose metabolism, cerebral blood flow (CBF), and brain-blood barrier (BBB) permeability, respectively. The results showed that combined treatment increased the neovascularization, neurogenesis, and VEGF secretion, modulated the astrocyte activation, enhanced the regional CBF, and glucose metabolism, as well as reduced BBB permeability and promoted claudin-5 expression, indicating the restoration of structure and function of NVU. The activation of ERK1/2 and Notch1 pathways and inhibition of AKT/mTOR pathway might be involved in the therapeutic mechanism. In summary, we have demonstrated that combined ADSCs with SF and BP, targeting the NVU remodelling, is a potential treatment for ischaemic stroke. These results may provide valuable information for developing future combined cellular and pharmacological therapeutic strategy for ischaemic stroke.
