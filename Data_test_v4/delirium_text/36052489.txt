It has recently been found that healthy diet and physical activity can reduce inflammatory markers and improve insulin sensitivity resulting in better survivorship outcomes in patients with prostate cancer. An "anti-inflammatory" lifestyle, including physical activity, healthy body weight, healthy diet, and stress reduction, has been associated with decreased cancer risk and progression. Epigenetic changes due to DNA methylation and altered gene expression associated with unhealthy lifestyle can be modulated by healthy behaviors. National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) focuses on healthy lifestyle, and it supports research on psychologic and physical approaches including dietary supplements and plant-based products, as well as mind and body approaches, such as yoga, massage, meditation, mindfulness-based stress reduction, and acupuncture.
