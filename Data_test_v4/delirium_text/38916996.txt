38916996|a|Lewy body dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are leading causes of cognitive impairment, characterized by distinct but overlapping neuropathological hallmarks. Lewy body disease (LBD) is characterized by alpha-synuclein aggregates in the form of Lewy bodies as well as the deposition of extracellular amyloid plaques, with many cases also exhibiting neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) pathology. In contrast, Alzheimer's disease is characterized by amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Both conditions often co-occur with additional neuropathological changes, such as vascular disease and TDP-43 pathology. To elucidate shared and distinct molecular signatures underlying these mixed neuropathologies, we extensively analyzed transcriptional changes in the anterior cingulate cortex, a brain region critically involved in cognitive processes. We performed bulk tissue RNAseq from the anterior cingulate cortex and determined differentially expressed genes (q-value < 0.05) in control (n = 81), Lewy body disease (n = 436), Alzheimer's disease (n = 53), and pathological amyloid cases consisting of amyloid pathology with minimal or no tau pathology (n = 39). We used gene set enrichment and weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) to understand the pathways associated with each neuropathologically defined group. Lewy body disease cases had strong up-regulation of inflammatory pathways and down-regulation of metabolic pathways. The Lewy body disease cases were further subdivided into either high Thal amyloid, Braak NFT, or low pathological burden cohorts. Compared to the control cases, the Lewy body disease cohorts consistently showed up-regulation for genes involved in protein folding and cytokine immune response, as well as down-regulation of fatty acid metabolism. Surprisingly, concomitant tau pathology within the Lewy body disease cases resulted in no additional changes. Some core inflammatory pathways were shared between Alzheimer's disease and Lewy body disease but with numerous disease-specific changes. Direct comparison of Lewy body disease cohorts versus Alzheimer's disease cases revealed strong enrichment of synaptic signaling, behavior, and neuronal system pathways. Females had a stronger response overall in both Lewy body and Alzheimer's disease, with several sex-specific changes. Overall, the results identify genes commonly and uniquely dysregulated in neuropathologically defined Lewy body disease and Alzheimer's disease cases, shedding light on shared and distinct molecular pathways. Additionally, the study underscores the importance of considering sex-specific changes in understanding the complex transcriptional landscape of these neurodegenerative diseases.
