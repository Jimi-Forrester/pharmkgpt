35652877|a|BACKGROUND: Hip fractures (HF) are among the most common fractures present in the emergency department and are very painful. Pericapsular nerve group block (PENG) is a new regional anesthesia technique developed for analgesia in total hip arthroplas-ties. We aimed to determine the effectiveness of PENG block used to reduce pain in patients with HF in the emergency department. METHODS: This single-center, randomized, and prospective study was carried out in the emergency department. The patients in-cluded in the study were selected according to the suitability of the personnel who will perform the procedure. The sealed envelope system was used for randomization. RESULTS: Statistical analysis was performed with 39 patients (18 patients in the PENG group, 21 patients in the control group). Thir-teen (33.3%) of the patients were female and 26 (66.7%) were male. The mean age was 75.3. At rest post-procedure, the mean Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) scores of the patients at the 30th min, 2nd, 6th, and 24th h were 1.78+-1.83, 0.00+-0.00, 0.00+-0.00, and 1.28+-1.41 in the PENG group. On the other hand, it was 3.38+-1.86, 0.05+-0.22, 2.86+-2.37, and 4.95+-1.47 in the control group, respectively. The mean NRS scores of the patients at 15  elevation of the leg at the 30th min, 2nd, 6th, and 24th h were 3.06+-1.80, 0.06+-0.24, 0.22+-0.43, and 2.44+-1.50 in the PENG group and it was 5.24+-1.81, 1.05+-0.92, 4.29+-2.35, and 7.14+-1.24 in the control group, respectively. CONCLUSION: PENG block can reduce pain and the need for systemic analgesics as a practical option in patients with HF.
