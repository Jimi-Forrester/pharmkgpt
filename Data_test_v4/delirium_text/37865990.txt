37865990|t|Genipin and pyrogallol: Two natural small molecules targeting the modulation of disordered proteins in Alzheimer's disease.
37865990|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the aggregation of disordered proteins, such as amyloid beta (Abeta) and tau, leading to neurotoxicity and disease progression. Despite numerous efforts, effective inhibitors of Abeta and tau aggregates have not been developed. Thus, we aimed to screen natural small molecules from crude extracts that target various pathologies and are prescribed for patients with neurological diseases. In this study, we screened 162 natural small molecules prescribed for neurological diseases and identified genipin and pyrogallol as hit compounds capable of simultaneously regulating the aggregation of Abeta and tau K18. Moreover, we confirmed the dual modulatory effects of these compounds on the reduction of amyloid-mediated neurotoxicity in vitro and the disassembly of preformed Abeta42 and tau K18 fibrils. Furthermore, we observed the alleviatory effects of genipin and pyrogallol against AD-related pathologies in triple transgenic AD mice. Molecular dynamics and docking simulations revealed the molecular interaction dynamics of genipin and pyrogallol with Abeta42 and tau K18, providing insights into their suppression of aggregation. Our findings suggest the therapeutic potential of genipin and pyrogallol as dual modulators for the treatment of AD by inhibiting aggregation or promoting dissociation of Abeta and tau.
