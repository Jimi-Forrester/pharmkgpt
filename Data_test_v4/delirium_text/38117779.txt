38117779|t|Association between use of antihypertensives and cognitive decline in the elderly-A retrospective observational study.
38117779|a|AIM: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is the prodromal phase of dementia. The objective of this study was to determine whether specific antihypertensives were associated with conversion from MCI to dementia. METHODS: In this retrospective study, a chart review was conducted on 335 older adults seen at the University of Alberta Hospital, Kaye Edmonton Seniors Clinic who were diagnosed with MCI. At the point of diagnosis, data was collected on demographic and lifestyle characteristics, measures of cognitive function, blood pressure measurements, use of antihypertensives, and other known or suspected risk factors for cognitive decline. Patients were followed for 5.5 years for dementia diagnoses. A logistic regression analysis was then conducted to determine the factors associated with conversion from MCI to dementia. RESULTS: Mean age (+- standard deviation) of the study participants was 76.5 +- 7.3 years. Patients who converted from MCI to dementia were significantly older and were more likely to have a family history of dementia. After controlling for potential confounders including age, sex, Mini Mental Status Exam scores and family history of dementia, patients who were on beta-blockers (BBs) had a 57% reduction in the odds of converting to dementia (OR: 0.43, 95% CI: 0.23, 0.81). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, BB use was protective against conversion from MCI to dementia. Further studies are required to confirm the findings of our study and to elucidate the effect of BBs on cognitive decline.
