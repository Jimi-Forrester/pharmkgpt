39055830|t|Tobacco as bioenergy and medical plant for biofuels and bioproduction.
39055830|a|Tobacco, a widely cultivated crop, has been extensively utilized by humans for an extended period. However, the tobacco industry generates a significant amount of organic waste, and the effective utilization of this tobacco waste has been limited. Currently, most tobacco waste is either recycled as reconstituted tobacco sheets or disposed of in landfills. However, tobacco possesses far more potential value than just these applications. This article provides an overview of the diverse uses of tobacco waste in agriculture, medicine, chemical engineering, and energy sectors. In the realm of agriculture, tobacco waste finds primary application as fertilizers and pesticides. In medical applications, the bioactive compounds present in tobacco are fully harnessed, resulting in the production of phenols, solanesol, polysaccharides, proteins, and even alkaloids. These bioactive compounds exhibit beneficial effects on human health. Additionally, the applications of tobacco waste in chemical engineering and energy sectors are centered around the utilization of lignocellulosic compounds and certain fuels. Chemical platform compounds derived from tobacco waste, as well as selected fuel sources, play a significant role in these areas. The rational utilization of tobacco waste represents a promising prospect, particularly in the present era when sustainable development is widely advocated. Moreover, this approach holds significant importance for enhancing energy utilization.
