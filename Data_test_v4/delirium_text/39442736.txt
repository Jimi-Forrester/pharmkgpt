39442736|a|OBJECTIVE: Elderly patients with Chronic Limb Threatening Ischemia (CLTI) undergoing revascularization are prone to delirium and prolonged hospitalization. Preoperative prehabilitation may prevent delirium and reduce the length of stay. This study investigates the effect of multimodal prehabilitation on delirium incidence in elderly CLTI patients undergoing revascularization. METHODS: A comparative observational cohort study conducted in a large teaching hospital (intervention cohort n=101, retrospective control cohort n=207) and a university hospital (prospective control cohort n=48) from 2020 to 2023. Patients aged >= 65 years undergoing revascularization were included, with acute treatment or severe cognitive impairment as exclusion criteria. The three-week prehabilitation program included screening of general health and presence of delirium risk factors by a vascular nurse practitioner, screening and provision of personalized, home-based exercises by a physiotherapist, provision of nutritional advice by a dietician, and if indicated comprehensive geriatric assessment by a geriatrician, assessment of self-reliance and home situation by a prearranged homecare nurse, guidance and support for smoking cessation by a quit smoking coach, and anaemia treatment. Primary outcome was 30-day delirium incidence, analysed using regression models adjusting for potential confounders (age, physical impairment, history of delirium, preoperative anaemia and revascularization type). Secondary outcomes were length of stay, postoperative complications, 30-day mortality, and patient experiences. RESULTS: Median age (IQR) was 76 years (71-82). Delirium incidence was lower in the prehabilitation cohort (n=2/101, 2%) compared to controls (n=23/255, 9%; OR=0.21, 95%CI 0.05-0.89, p=.04). Adjusted analysis showed a non-significant delirium reduction (OR=0.28, 95%CI 0.06-1.3, p=.097). The prehabilitation cohort had a significantly shorter length of stay (2 [1-5] vs 4 [2-9] days; p=<.001), and fewer minor complications (14% vs 26%, p=.01). No differences were present in major complications and 30-day mortality. Patients reported high compliance and satisfaction (median score 8/10, IQR 7-9). CONCLUSIONS: Prehabilitation among elderly CLTI patients is safe and has the potential to yield multiple beneficial effects on general outcomes following revascularization, while also achieving high levels of patient satisfaction. Further validation and considering implementation in surgical settings is recommended.
