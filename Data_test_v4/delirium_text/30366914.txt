30366914|a|OBJECTIVES: Use of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) to treat severe aortic stenosis (AS) has gained popularity, accompanied by an evolution of patient and clinical factors. We aimed to characterise changes and evaluate their impact on outcomes. SETTING: In this single-centre, German TAVIK registry patients undergoing TAVI between 2008 and 2015 were documented prospectively. PARTICIPANTS/INTERVENTIONS: 2000 consecutive patients with AS undergoing TAVI were divided in four cohorts. 500 patients underwent TAVI in each of the following time bins: April 2008 to July 2010 (cohort I), July 2010 to April 2013 (cohort II), April 2012 to October 2013 (cohort III) and October 2013 to March 2015 (cohort IV). RESULTS: The mean age was 81.8 years, without significant variation across cohorts. Compared with cohort I, prior MI (5.4%vs11.0%; p<0.001) and New York Heart Association class IV (10.0%vs3.6%; p<0.001) were less common in cohort IV. Across cohorts, there was a fall in EuroSCORE (24.3%-18.7%), frailty (48.4%-17.0%) and use of transapical access (43.6%-29.0%), while transfemoral access increased (56.4%-71.0%; p<0.001 for each). Periprocedurally, there was a fall in moderate/severe aortic regurgitation (3.2%-0.0%) and rate of unplanned cardiopulmonary bypass (4.0%-1.0%; both p<0.001). A similar trend applied to 30-day rate of major vascular complications (5.2%-1.8%; p=0.006), life-threatening bleeding (7.0%-3.0%; p<0.001) and cardiovascular mortality (4.4%-1.8%; p=0.020). One-year post-TAVI, mortality and stroke rates did not differ. CONCLUSIONS: Evolution of TAVI between 2008 and 2015 saw a trend towards its usage in lower risk patients and rapid progression towards improved safety. Evaluation and refinement should now continue to further lessen stroke and pacemaker rates.
