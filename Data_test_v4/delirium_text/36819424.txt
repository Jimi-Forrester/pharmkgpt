36819424|t|A Rare Presentation of Late-Onset Mania Following Right-Sided Lacunar Infarct.
36819424|a|Stroke can result in various psychiatric disorders. It is uncommon for people to experience their first episode of mania later in life, amounting to only 1% as compared to post-stroke depression, where the incidence is comparatively high. Significant attention has been paid to the study of post-stroke depression. However, reports of manic episodes following a stroke are uncommon. Just five reported cases of mania or bipolar disorder following a cerebral infarction due to damage to the left hemisphere had been published as of late 1996. There is insufficient evidence to conclude whether late-onset mania has an organic or non-organic basis. There hasn't been a lot of research done in this area. In this report, we present a case of an elderly woman who presented with mania after being treated with an anti-depressant following a chronic cerebral infarction.
