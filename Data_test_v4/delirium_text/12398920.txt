12398920|a|Alzheimer's disease is associated with glial activation and increased levels of the cytokines as well as impaired forebrain cholinergic function. Current therapies focus on enhancing cholinergic function by administrating acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, such as galantamine. Epidemiological results also suggest that anti-inflammatory therapies might be effective in slowing the onset of the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. The current study investigated the ability of a nitric oxide (NO)-donating derivative of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) flurbiprofen, HCT1026, to reduce brain inflammation in young rats. Inflammation was produced by chronic infusion of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) into the 4th ventricle. The release of NO from HCT1026 requires the action of esterase enzymes. The current study determined whether the effectiveness of HCT1026 was attenuated by simultaneous treatment with the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor galantamine. Daily administration of the HCT1026 significantly reduced microglial activation and these effects were not attenuated by galantamine therapy.
