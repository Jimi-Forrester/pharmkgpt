30283265|t|Clinical Lifestyle Medicine Strategies for Preventing and Reversing Memory Loss in Alzheimer's.
30283265|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and currently affects over 5 million Americans and 30 million individuals worldwide. Unfortunately, the current approach to treating AD provides nothing more than a marginal, unsustained, symptomatic effect, with little or no effect on disease progression itself. To attain effective improvements in AD, one must determine risk factors, address the underlying causes, and focus on a combination of functional and lifestyle medicine strategies that provide a comprehensive, programmatic, and network-based approach that is sufficient to achieve epigenetic transformation and neurologic healing through its multiple and necessary synergistic components. Rather than normalizing metabolic parameters, the focus is on optimization of each metabolic parameter. Papers published by research neurologist, Dr Dale Bredesen have documented that symptoms of mild cognitive impairment and early AD may often be reversed within 6 months after initiating a comprehensive, functional and lifestyle medicine-focused program. The purpose of this article are as follows: 1. Shed light on a promising clinical protocol that focuses on a comprehensive functional and lifestyle medicine approach to treating mild cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease; 2. Identify the Bredesen Protocol testing, diagnostic and treatment guidelines; 3. Review several case studies and discuss the promising results of the program. Although published case studies such as those reported here are relatively few, clinicians applying these comprehensive strategies have reason to expect improvement in their patients. Lifestyle medicine can be a source of greatly needed hope for those suffering with cognitive decline.
