34163283|t|Treatment Compliance Communications Between Patients with Severe Mental Illness and Treating Healthcare Providers: A Retrospective Study of Documentation Using Healthcare Reimbursement Claims and Medical Chart Abstraction.
34163283|a|INTRODUCTION: Successful treatment for serious mental illnesses (SMIs) requires a good therapeutic alliance with healthcare providers and compliance with prescribed therapies such as antipsychotic medications. This retrospective study, which utilized administrative claims linked with abstracted medical chart data, addressed a data gap regarding compliance-related discussions between providers and patients. METHODS: Commercially insured patients in ambulatory care post-acute (emergency or inpatient) event were eligible. Criteria included age 18-65 years; schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or major depressive disorder diagnoses; continuous enrollment 6 months before to 12 months after the first acute event claim dated 01/01/2014 to 12/31/2015; and antipsychotic medication prescription. Demographic and clinical data, and patient-provider discussions about treatment compliance were characterized from claims and abstracted medical charts. RESULTS: Ninety patients (62% female, mean age 41 years) were included and 680 visits were abstracted; only 58% had first-visit antipsychotic compliance discussions. Notably, 18% of patients had discussions using the specific terms "compliance," "persistence," or "adherence," whereas half were identified by more general terms. Compliance discussions were observed least often among the patients with schizophrenia, as compared with bipolar or major depressive disorders-a counterintuitive finding. DISCUSSION: Compliance discussions may represent intervention opportunities to optimize treatment, yet their study is a complex endeavor. The results of this study show an opportunity to improve this valuable treatment step.
