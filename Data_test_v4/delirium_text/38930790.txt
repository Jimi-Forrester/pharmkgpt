38930790|t|Abietane Diterpenes from Medusantha martiusii and Their Anti-Neuroinflammatory Activity.
38930790|a|Seven new abietane diterpenoids, comprising medusanthol A-G (1-3, 5, 7-9) and two previously identified analogs (4 and 6), were isolated from the hexane extract of the aerial parts of Medusantha martiusii. The structures of the compounds were elucidated by HRESIMS, 1D/2D NMR spectroscopic data, IR spectroscopy, NMR calculations with DP4+ probability analysis, and ECD calculations. The anti-neuroinflammatory potential of compounds 1-7 was evaluated by determining their ability to inhibit the production of nitric oxide (NO) and the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha in BV2 microglia stimulated with LPS and IFN-gamma. Compounds 1-4 and 7 exhibited decreased NO levels at a concentration of 12.5 microM. Compound 1 demonstrated strong activity with an IC50 of 3.12 microM, and compound 2 had an IC50 of 15.53 microM; both compounds effectively reduced NO levels compared to the positive control quercetin (IC50 11.8 microM). Additionally, both compounds significantly decreased TNF-alpha levels, indicating their potential as promising anti-neuroinflammatory agents.
