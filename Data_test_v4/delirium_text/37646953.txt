37646953|t|The role of A[Formula: see text] and Tau proteins in Alzheimer's disease: a mathematical model on graphs.
37646953|a|In this Note we study a mathematical model for the progression of Alzheimer's Disease in the human brain. The novelty of our approach consists in the representation of the brain as two superposed graphs where toxic proteins diffuse, the connectivity graph which represents the neural network, and the proximity graph which takes into account the extracellular space. Toxic proteins such as [Formula: see text] amyloid and Tau play in fact a crucial role in the development of Alzheimer's disease and, separately, have been targets of medical treatments. Recent biomedical literature stresses the potential impact of the synergetic action of these proteins. We numerically test various modelling hypotheses which confirm the relevance of this synergy.
