34941088|a|BACKGROUND: Cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) is a common neurological disease under the effect of multiple factors. Although some literature analyzes and summarizes the risk factors of CSVD, the conclusions are controversial. To determine the risk factors of CSVD, we conducted this meta-analysis. METHODS: Five authoritative databases of PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, CNKI, and Wan Fang were searched to find related studies published before November 30, 2020. The literature was screened according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. We used RevMan 5.4 software to analyze the data after extraction. RESULTS: A total of 29 studies involving 16,587 participants were included. The meta-analysis showed that hypertension (odds ratio [OR] 3.16, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.22-4.49), diabetes (OR 2.15, 95% CI 1.59-2.90), hyperlipidemia (OR 1.64, 95% CI 1.11-2.40), smoking (OR 1.47, 95% CI 1.15-1.89) were significantly related to the risk of lacune, while drinking (OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.87-1.23) was not. And hypertension (OR 3.31, 95% CI 2.65-4.14), diabetes (OR 1.66, 95% CI 2.65-1.84), hyperlipidemia (OR 1.88, 95% CI 1.08-3.25), smoking (OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.07-2.04) were significantly related to the risk of white matter hyperintensity, while drinking (OR 1.41, 95% CI 0.97-2.05) was not. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggested that hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and smoking are risk factors of CSVD, and we should take measures to control these risk factors for the purpose of preventing CSVD.
