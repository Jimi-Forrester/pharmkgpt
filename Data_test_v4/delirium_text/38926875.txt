38926875|t|Is comorbidity alone responsible for changes in health-related quality of life among critical care survivors? A purpose-specific review.
38926875|a|BACKGROUND: Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is one of the most important outcome variables for assessing the effectiveness of intensive care, together with mortality and survival, where comorbidity is suggested to have high impact. However, studies are lacking that examine to what extent HRQoL is affected after a general ICU period, beyond that of the effects that may be claimed to be due to comorbidities. DESIGN: Purpose-specific literature review including literature searches in PubMed, Cinahl, Scopus, and Cochrane library between 2010 and 2021. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: This Purpose-specific, i.e., task focused review examines HRQoL (assessed by either SF-36 or EQ-5D, > 30 days after leaving the hospital) in adult patients (>= 18 years) having an ICU length of stay > 24 h. Further, the HRQoL comparisons were adjusted for age or comorbidity. A total of 11 publications were found. A majority comprised observational, prospective cohort studies, except three that were either case-control, cross-sectional comparison, or retrospective cohort studies. A total of 18,566 critically ill patients were included, and the response rate ranged from 16 to 94%. In all studies, a recurrent relevant finding was that HRQoL after ICU care was affected by pre-ICU comorbidities. In three studies (n = 3), which included a comorbidity adjusted control group, there were no effect of the critical care period itself on the registered HRQoL after the critical care period. CONCLUSION: Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) in former ICU patients appears to be primarily influenced by comorbidity. A notable limitation in this field of research is the high heterogeneity observed in the studies reviewed, particularly in terms of the HRQoL measurement tool employed, the duration of follow-up, the methodology for comorbidity assessment, and the adjustments for age and sex. Despite these variations and the limited number of studies in the review, the findings suggest a minimal HRQoL impact beyond the effects of comorbidity. Given the significant dearth of comprehensive studies in this domain, there is an escalating call for more thorough and detailed research endeavours.
