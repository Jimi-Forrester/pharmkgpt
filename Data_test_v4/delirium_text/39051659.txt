39051659|a|Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is considered an early indicator of Alzheimer's disease. Previous evidence suggests that postmenopausal females are at heightened risk for developing dementia. However, the potential effects of gender (i.e. postmenopausal female) on functional connectivity density (FCD) in individuals with SCD are not well understood. A total of 56 healthy controls and 57 subjects with SCD were included. The short-range and long-range FCD (srFCD and lrFCD) mapping of each participant was calculated. The interactive effect of gender x diagnosis on the FCD was explored by two-way analysis of variance. The interaction effect of gender x diagnosis on lrFCD was primarily in the right middle frontal gyrus (MFG). The older males with SCD exhibited significantly enhanced lrFCD in the right MFG relative to other subgroups. The lrFCD of the right MFG was positively associated with cognitive performance in older females with SCD. Cognition-related functional terms were significantly related to the right MFG. Decreased lrFCD of the right MFG in cognitively normal older women may explain why postmenopausal females have a higher risk for progression to dementia than men. Furthermore, this altered pattern could be applied to identify individuals with a high risk for dementia.
