36505911|a|Background: Family caregivers can experience significant stress related to behaviour changes in persons with dementia (PWD). Approaches to support caregivers with stress management when responding to changes in behaviours are needed. The Baycrest Quick-Response Caregiver ToolTM (BQRCT) was developed to provide caregivers with an online tool that can be used in real time to recognize and manage their emotions when managing neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia. Methods: A mixed-methods approach was used to evaluate the feasibility of this new tool. Family caregivers of persons with dementia received education about managing neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia through the online tool. Caregiver demographic information and feedback about the tool was obtained through telephone and online surveys. Health-care providers accessed the tool and also provided feedback. Results: The 21 caregivers who completed the study found the tool helpful and reported high feasibility that included being able to access, complete, and implement the strategies presented in the tool. The 18 health-care providers found the tool useful and most would recommend it to peers and clients. Participants also provided specific suggestions for improvement, such as including more examples of complex behaviours. Conclusions: This tool adds to and complements existing strategies for managing neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia. Its accessibility through the online platform is especially useful for caregivers who are unable to seek help in person, and for health-care providers and caregivers seeking additional resources.
