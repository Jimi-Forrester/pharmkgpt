1772637|a|The dietary intake of 29 healthy controls was compared with that of 35 community-dwelling patients with probable or definite senile dementia of the Alzheimer type (SDAT), based on NINCDS-ADRDA criteria. The control subject or the caregiver of the SDAT patient completed a 3-day estimated-dietary-intake record. Foods offered to patients were chosen, for the most part, by caregivers, but SDAT patients were allowed to eat ad libitum from those choices, and food consumed was recorded. Dietary intake was evaluated against the 1989 Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA). Dietary intakes did not differ significantly between control and SDAT patients for any of the 32 nutrients analyzed. The controls and SDAT patients met the RDA guidelines for intake of total energy, protein, and micronutrients, with the exception of female SDAT patients, who did not consume a minimum of two thirds of the RDA for vitamin D. All biochemical indices of nutritional status were within normal limits for the SDAT patients. In addition, cognitive function did not correlate with intake of any nutrient studied. We conclude that moderately impaired, community-dwelling patients with SDAT do not differ from healthy controls in nutritional status or nutrient intake. Neither general nor nutrient-specific malnutrition was present in this population. Based on this cross-sectional study, malnutrition does not appear to be a major contributor to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease. However, this investigation examined only a single point in time, when patients were being fed by caregivers, so that the role of malnutrition at the beginning of the disease was not addressed.
