38258071|a|Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative condition marked by the progressive deterioration of cognitive abilities, memory impairment, and the accumulation of abnormal proteins, specifically beta-amyloid plaques and tau tangles, within the brain. Despite extensive research efforts, Alzheimer's disease remains without a cure, presenting a significant global healthcare challenge. Recently, there has been an increased focus on antibody-based treatments as a potentially effective method for dealing with Alzheimer's disease. This paper offers a comprehensive overview of the current status of research on antibody-based molecules as therapies for Alzheimer's disease. We will briefly mention their mechanisms of action, therapeutic efficacy, and safety profiles while addressing the challenges and limitations encountered during their development. We also highlight some crucial considerations in antibody-based treatment development, including patient selection criteria, dosing regimens, or safety concerns. In conclusion, antibody-based therapies present a hopeful outlook for addressing Alzheimer's disease. While challenges remain, the accumulating evidence suggests that these therapies may offer substantial promise in ameliorating or preventing the progression of this debilitating condition, thus potentially enhancing the quality of life for the millions of individuals and families affected by Alzheimer's disease worldwide.
