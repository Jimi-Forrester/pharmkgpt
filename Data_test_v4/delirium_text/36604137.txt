36604137|t|Effect of polyphenol compounds on Helicobacter pylori eradication: a systematic review with meta-analysis.
36604137|a|OBJECTIVES: Polyphenol compounds are classified as organic compounds with phenolic units exhibiting a variety of biological functions. This meta-analysis aims to assess the efficacy and safety of polyphenol compounds (curcumin, cranberry, garlic, liquorice and broccoli) in eradicating Helicobacter pylori. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: Literature searches were conducted on PubMed, Embase, The Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Medline, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure database, Chinese Scientific Journal Database and Wan Fang database from inception to January 2022. All randomised controlled trials comparing polyphenol compounds with the placebo or used as an adjunct treatment are included in this meta-analysis.The treatment effect for dichotomous outcomes was assessed using risk ratio (RR), while for continuous outcomes, mean differences both with 95% CIs, were used. Subgroup analyses were carried out for different treatment schemes and polyphenol compound species. RESULTS: 12 trials were included in the meta-analysis. The total eradication rate of H.pylori in the polyphenol compounds group was higher than in the group without polyphenol compounds. Statistical significance was also observed (RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.38, p=0.02). The most frequent adverse effects of polyphenol compounds included diarrhoea, headache and vomiting. However, there were no differences regarding side effects between the two groups (RR 1.47, 95% CI 0.83 to 2.58, p=0.18). In subgroup analyses, the H.pylori eradication rate regimens with polyphenols therapy was superior to that of regimens without polyphenols therapy in the polyphenols versus placebo subgroup (RR 4.23, 95% CI 1.38 to 12.95, p=0.01), polyphenols plus triple therapy versus triple therapy subgroup (RR 1.11, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.22, p=0.03). CONCLUSION: Polyphenol compounds can improve H.pylori eradication rates. Polyphenol compounds plus standard triple therapy can significantly improve the eradication. However, no evidence of a higher incidence of side effects could be found. PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42022307477.
