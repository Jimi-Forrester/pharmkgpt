32934982|t|Thyrotoxicosis in a Postpartum Adolescent: A Simulation Case for Emergency Medicine Providers.
32934982|a|Introduction: Thyroid storm is a rare but life-threatening disease process that may be difficult to recognize and mimics other disease processes. It is critical for the emergency medicine clinician to be able to recognize thyroid storm in patients in order to effectively stabilize and treat them. Methods: In this standardized patient case, learners were faced with a 17-year-old postpartum woman presenting to the emergency department with respiratory distress and altered mental status secondary to thyroid storm. The target learners were emergency department providers, including residents, medical students, and advanced practice practitioners. Providers were expected to identify signs and symptoms of thyroid storm and to initiate appropriate diagnostic workup and management of this complex patient. Debriefing followed the simulation using a debriefing guide and PowerPoint presentation. Results: Thirty-four learners participated in this simulation. All learners agreed or strongly agreed that the simulation case was relevant to their work, and 97% agreed or strongly agreed that it was effective in teaching thyroid storm management skills. Eighty-five percent felt that following the simulation, they would be confident in their ability to recognize thyroid storm in a postpartum patient and to recognize and manage respiratory distress and altered mental status in a postpartum patient. Discussion: Learners felt that this case was effective in teaching the skills necessary for caring for postpartum patients with respiratory distress and altered mental status. Future directions include conducting the simulation in situ to include multidisciplinary teams and increasing the learner pool to include OB/GYN residents.
