31311182|t|Biotechnological Advances in Resveratrol Production and its Chemical Diversity.
31311182|a|The very well-known bioactive natural product, resveratrol (3,5,4'-trihydroxystilbene), is a highly studied secondary metabolite produced by several plants, particularly grapes, passion fruit, white tea, and berries. It is in high demand not only because of its wide range of biological activities against various kinds of cardiovascular and nerve-related diseases, but also as important ingredients in pharmaceuticals and nutritional supplements. Due to its very low content in plants, multi-step isolation and purification processes, and environmental and chemical hazards issues, resveratrol extraction from plants is difficult, time consuming, impracticable, and unsustainable. Therefore, microbial hosts, such as Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Corynebacterium glutamicum, are commonly used as an alternative production source by improvising resveratrol biosynthetic genes in them. The biosynthesis genes are rewired applying combinatorial biosynthetic systems, including metabolic engineering and synthetic biology, while optimizing the various production processes. The native biosynthesis of resveratrol is not present in microbes, which are easy to manipulate genetically, so the use of microbial hosts is increasing these days. This review will mainly focus on the recent biotechnological advances for the production of resveratrol, including the various strategies used to produce its chemically diverse derivatives.
