26588585|t|Synthesis of Denosomin-Vitamin D3 Hybrids and Evaluation of Their Anti-Alzheimer's Disease Activities.
26588585|a|As an extension of previously conducted studies on developing an anti-Alzheimer's disease agent, denosomin (1-deoxy-24-norsominone, an artificial inducer of neurite elongation), derivatives were designed and synthesized based on the hypothesis that our denosomin would exhibit axonal extension activity via a 1,25D(3)-membrane-associated, rapid response steroid-binding protein (1,25D(3)-MARRS) pathway. The biological assay revealed that the hybridization of characteristic delta-lactone in denosomin and the triene moiety in VD(3) was effective to enhance the nerve re-extension activity in amyloid beta (Abeta)-damaged neurons.
