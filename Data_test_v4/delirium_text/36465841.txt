36465841|a|People from some parts of the world traditionally depend on different herbal medicines for fertility regulation. The Mishing women of Assam, India have been using the dry root powder of Persicaria hydropiper for years as a birth control medicine. The present study was designed to investigate the chemical composition of methanolic extract from the dry roots of P. hydropiper as well as to study its anti-implantation effect. P. hydropiper roots were collected from paddy fields and the methanolic extract was prepared using dry powdered roots. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GCMS) analysis of the methanolic root extract was performed for phytochemical analysis. The estrous cycle of the female mice was monitored by observation of the cells in the vaginal smear. The estrogenic and anti-implantation effect was observed using routine histological procedures with Haematoxylin & Eosin staining performed in mice. Total serum cholesterol level was also measured. The GCMS analysis revealed the presence of stigmasterol and 3-deoxyestradiol, which are known to possess antifertility properties. The extract (1000 mg/kg bodyweight dose) altered the duration and sequence of the estrous cycle of cyclic females with a prolonged metestrous of 2 days, followed by an early estrous. There was hyperplasia in the endometrial epithelium and even shedding of the same on high duration treatment on day 6. There was a significant (p < 0.05) rise in total cholesterol levels in the treated groups. The highest rise was observed in the day 1 group (from 67.91 +- 1.98 to 147.53 +- 3.20 mg/dl) while the lowest change was there in the day 2 group (from 78.76 +- 2.04 to 103.26 +- 2.34 mg/dl). The presence of compounds like stigmasterol and 3-deoxyestradiol with profound antifertility properties possibly has an influence on the molecular pathway for embryo implantation. The changes in uterine histoarchitecture in the form of uterine hyperplasia on treatment with the extract point out towards the effect of the estrogenic compounds. Such implantation preventing results provides support to the traditional belief and opens the door for new drug discovery for reproduction regulation. A detailed molecular study is necessary in this regard.
