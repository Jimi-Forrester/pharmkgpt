35885575|t|The Significance of Asymmetry in the Assessment of Brain Perfusion in Atypical Tauopathic Parkinsonian Syndromes.
35885575|a|Progressive supranuclear palsy syndrome (PSPS) and corticobasal syndrome (CBS) are clinical manifestations of tauopathic Parkinsonian syndromes. Due to their overlapping symptomatology, the differential diagnosis of these entities may be difficult when bounded to clinical assessment. The manifestations are commonly associated with pathological entities-corticobasal degeneration and progressive supranuclear palsy, which are four-repeat tauopathies. In this study, the authors attempted to find whether the asymmetry typically associated with CBS may be feasible in the interpretation of perfusion single-photon computed tomography. The analysis based on the examination of patients with progressive supranuclear palsy-Richardson syndrome (PSP-RS), progressive supranuclear palsy-Parkinsonism predominant (PSP-P), and corticobasal syndrome (CBS) revealed significant asymmetry of perfusion of the amygdala in corticobasal syndrome. The more pronounced abnormalities of perfusion were observed in the left amygdala among patients with more severe Parkinsonian syndromes in CBS on the right. This study shows that the comparison of the perfusion of tauopathic Parkinsonian syndromes should be extended by asymmetry analysis. Interestingly, the differentiating potential of brain perfusion is present in the comparison of CBS and PSP-RS, but not in CBS and PSP-P. This phenomenon could be explained by more distinct asymmetry in the perfusion observed in PSP-P, which diminishes the differentiating potential of this parameter when it comes to the comparison of PSP-P and CBS. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study evaluating which structures can be interpreted as significantly asymmetrical in the context of perfusion in CBS.
