35371472|a|Introduction: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, is a newly conducted respiratory disease caused by infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2). The current study aims to estimate the neurological diseases which develop after COVID-19 infection. Method: This is a single center retrospective case series conducted in seven months. the patients were collected in an out-patient clinic. Diagnosis of COVID-19 and the way of diagnosis is confirmed through either polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for COVID-19 and/or typical findings on chest computed tomography scan (CT scan). Patients developed neurological symptoms after being infected with COVID-19. Symptoms have to be developed within less than 6 months of recovery, or developed during illness and persisted after recovery. Result: A total number of 59 patients infected with SARS-CoV2 were included. The majority of the patients had mild symptoms 32 (54%), 12 (20%) patients developed severe symptoms. Headache was the most common presenting symptom 27(46%) followed by fatigue in 8 (13.5%). The majority of the patients 55 (91.6%) presented with no focal signs. MRI was done for 27 (46%) patients without abnormal finding in 22 cases. Nearly 22 (37.3%) cases were diagnosed as recurrent episodes of migraine or new onset of migraine. All patients were managed according to the underlying pathology, only (28, 47.5%) patients were known to be completely recovered. Conclusion: SARS-CoV2 can invade and cause inflammation in the central and peripheral nervous systems. It is responsible for many neurological problems. More studies are necessary to analyze the long term effect of the virus on the nervous system.
