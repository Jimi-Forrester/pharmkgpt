38789433|a|Previous evidence suggests elevated levels of oxidatively-induced DNA damage, particularly 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OH-dG), and abnormalities in the repair of 8-OH-dG by the base excision repair (BER) in bipolar disorder (BD). However, the genetic disposition of these abnormalities remains unknown. In this study, we aimed to investigate the levels of oxidatively-induced DNA damage and BER mechanisms in individuals with BD and their siblings, as compared to healthy controls (HCs). 46 individuals with BD, 41 siblings of individuals with BD, and 51 HCs were included in the study. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was employed to evaluate the levels of 8-OH-dG in urine, which were then normalized based on urine creatinine levels. The real-time-polymerase chain reaction was used to measure the expression levels of 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase 1 (OGG1), apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1), poly ADP-ribose polymerase 1 (PARP1), and DNA polymerase beta (POLbeta). The levels of 8-OH-dG were found to be elevated in both individuals with BD and their siblings when compared to the HCs. The OGG1 and APE1 expressions were downregulated, while POLbeta expressions were upregulated in both the patient and sibling groups compared to the HCs. Age, smoking status, and the number of depressive episodes had an impact on APE1 expression levels in the patient group while body mass index, smoking status, and past psychiatric history had an impact on 8-OH-dG levels in siblings. Both individuals with BD and unaffected siblings presented similar abnormalities regarding oxidatively-induced DNA damage and BER, suggesting a link between abnormalities in DNA damage/BER mechanisms and familial susceptibility to BD. Our findings suggest that targeting the oxidatively-induced DNA damage and BER pathway could offer promising therapeutic strategies for reducing the risk of age-related diseases and comorbidities in individuals with a genetic predisposition to BD.
