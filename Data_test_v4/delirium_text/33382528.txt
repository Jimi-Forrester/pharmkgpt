33382528|a|INTRODUCTION: Several clinical studies have tested the efficacy of insulin-sensitizing drugs for cognitive enhancement in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, as type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a well-recognized risk factor for AD. Pilot studies assessing FDA-approved diabetes drugs in subjects with early-stage disease have found cognitive benefit in subjects comorbid for insulin resistance. In AD mouse models with concomitant insulin resistance, we have shown that 4 weeks of RSG can reverse peripheral and central insulin resistance concomitant with rescue of hippocampus-dependent fear learning and memory and hippocampal circuitry deficits in 9-month-old (9MO) Tg2576 mice with no effect in wild-type (WT) mice. Bioinformatics analysis of genomic and proteomic data reveals an intimate link between PPARgamma and MAPK/ERK signaling in the hippocampus. We then demonstrated a direct interaction between PPARgamma and phospho-ERK in vitro and in vivo during memory consolidation. The translational value of this discovery is evidenced by the positive correlational relationship between human AD postmortem brain levels of pERK-PPARgamma nuclear complexes with cognitive reserve. METHODS: We tested whether insulin sensitizer therapy could rescue spatial navigation, context discrimination, and object recognition learning and memory in aged wild-type and Tg2576 mice in addition to hippocampus-dependent contextual fear learning and memory, as we have previously reported. RESULTS: We found that rosiglitazone treatment improved cognitive domains that predominantly rely upon the dorsal hippocampus rather than those that additionally engage the ventral hippocampus. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that insulin sensitizer therapy with rosiglitazone improved age- and AD-related learning and memory deficits in circuit selective ways.
