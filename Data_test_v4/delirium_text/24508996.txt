24508996|a|BACKGROUND: We found previously that the amyloid beta40/42 (Abeta40/42) ratio and the level of protein-conjugated acrolein (PC-Acro) in plasma were increased in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) subjects. We determined whether MCI and AD subjects can be differentiated based on the levels of Abeta40, Abeta42, and PC-Acro in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). METHODS: Abeta40, Abeta42, PC-Acro, Tau and phosphorylated Tau in CSF were measured by ELISA. RESULTS: Median values of Abeta40, Abeta40/PC-Acro and Abeta40/42 in CSF were significantly lower in 54 AD subjects than those in 40 MCI subjects. Severity of VOI (volume of interest) atrophy was most intensely correlated with the decrease in Abeta40/PC-Acro and then that in Abeta40 and Abeta42/PC-Acro. MMSE was most intensely correlated with the decrease in Abeta42 and Abeta40, and then that in Abeta42/PC-Acro and Abeta40/PC-Acro. CONCLUSION: A decrease in Abeta40/PC-Acro in CSF is well correlated with brain damage, and a decrease in Abeta42 and Abeta40 is well correlated with cognitive ability. Measurement of PC-Acro together with Abeta40 and Abeta42 provides a more precise evaluation of severity of AD subjects.
