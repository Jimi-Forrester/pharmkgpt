16040006|t|Association study of the A2M and LRP1 Genes with Alzheimer disease in the Han Chinese.
16040006|a|BACKGROUND: Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) and alpha-2-macroglobulin (A2M) are two plausible candidate genes for Alzheimer disease (AD) based on their important biological function and positional information. To date, numerous studies have investigated their possible association with AD but the results are controversial. METHODS: To investigate the potential genetic contribution of the two genes in the Han Chinese population, we performed a case-control association study using 10 polymorphisms (4 in LRP1 and 6 in A2M) that span approximately the whole corresponding gene. RESULTS: Comparison of allele, genotype, and haplotype frequencies for polymorphisms in A2M revealed no significant differences between patients and control subjects. For the LRP1 gene, however, we found an overrepresentation of the CTCG haplotype in the control group (p = .002). The difference was still of statistical significance in the apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon 4 negative subjects (p(CTCG) = .003). Multiple logistic regression analysis did not show any evidence of synergism between A2M, LRP1, and APOE. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the CTCG haplotype of LRP1 may reduce the risk of late-onset AD, but A2M is not associated with this disease in the Han Chinese population.
