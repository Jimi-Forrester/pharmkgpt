35769877|a|Tumors evolve in a dynamic communication with their native tissue environment and recruited immune cells. The diverse components of the tumor microenvironment (TME) can critically regulate tumor progression and therapeutic response. In turn, anticancer treatments may alter the composition and functions of the TME. To investigate this continuous dialog in the context of primary brain cancers, we developed a multimodal longitudinal imaging strategy. We combined macroscopical magnetic resonance imaging with subcellular resolution two-photon intravital microscopy, and leveraged the power of single-cell analysis tools to gain insights into the ongoing interactions between different components of the TME and cancer cells. Our experiments revealed that the migratory behavior of tumor-associated macrophages is different in genetically distinct glioblastomas, and in response to macrophage-targeted therapy. These results underscore the importance of studying cancer longitudinally in an in vivo setting, to reveal complex and dynamic alterations in the TME during disease progression and therapeutic intervention.
