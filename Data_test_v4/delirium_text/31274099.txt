31274099|a|An increase in the prevalence of many diseases affecting the nervous system in both children and adults has been reported. Some of these diseases are related to endocrine dysfunction, notably of the thyroid axis. Examples in children are attention deficit/hyperactivity disorders and Autism Spectrum Disorders, diagnosed but most often affecting the whole life, and multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer's disease in adults. It is becoming increasingly clear that embryonic exposure to thyroid hormone disruptors can lead to short- and long-term consequences, that often escape conventional neonatal diagnosis. Endocrine disruptors comprise a wide range of molecules, plasticizers, some pesticides, surfactants, flame-retardants, etc., many of which can interfere with thyroid hormone synthesis or their actions. We here report briefly the history of endocrine disruptors, their properties and the consequences on neuronal development of embryonic exposure to some of them.
