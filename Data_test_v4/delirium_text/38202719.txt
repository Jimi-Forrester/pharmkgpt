38202719|t|Selenoproteins in Health.
38202719|a|Selenium (Se) is a naturally occurring essential micronutrient that is required for human health. The existing form of Se includes inorganic and organic. In contrast to the inorganic Se, which has low bioavailability and high cytotoxicity, organic Se exhibits higher bioavailability, lower toxicity, and has a more diverse composition and structure. This review presents the nutritional benefits of Se by listing and linking selenoprotein (SeP) functions to evidence of health benefits. The research status of SeP from foods in recent years is introduced systematically, particularly the sources, biochemical transformation and speciation, and the bioactivities. These aspects are elaborated with references for further research and utilization of organic Se compounds in the field of health.
