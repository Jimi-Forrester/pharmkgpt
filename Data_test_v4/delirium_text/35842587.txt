35842587|a|Recently, mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC)-based therapy has become an appreciated therapeutic approach in the context of neurodegenerative disease therapy. Accordingly, a myriad of studies in animal models and also some clinical trials have evinced the safety, feasibility, and efficacy of MSC transplantation in neurodegenerative conditions, most importantly in Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Huntington's disease (HD). The MSC-mediated desired effect is mainly a result of secretion of immunomodulatory factors in association with release of various neurotrophic factors (NTFs), such as glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Thanks to the secretion of protein-degrading molecules, MSC therapy mainly brings about the degradation of pathogenic protein aggregates, which is a typical appearance of chronic neurodegenerative disease. Such molecules, in turn, diminish neuroinflammation and simultaneously enable neuroprotection, thereby alleviating disease pathological symptoms and leading to cognitive and functional recovery. Also, MSC differentiation into neural-like cells in vivo has partially been evidenced. Herein, we focus on the therapeutic merits of MSCs and also their derivative exosome as an innovative cell-free approach in AD, HD, PD, and ALS conditions. Also, we give a brief glimpse into novel approaches to potentiate MSC-induced therapeutic merits in such disorders, most importantly, administration of preconditioned MSCs.
