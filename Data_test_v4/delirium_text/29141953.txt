29141953|a|The human Abeta42 peptide is associated with Alzheimer's disease through its deleterious effects in neurons. Expressing the human peptide in adult Drosophila in a tissue- and time-controlled manner, we show that Abeta42 is also toxic in non-neural cells, neurosecretory and epithelial cell types in particular. This form of toxicity includes the aberrant signaling by Wingless morphogen leading to the eventual activation of Caspase 3. Preventing Caspase 3 activation by means of p53 keeps epithelial cells from elimination but maintains the Abeta42 toxicity yielding more severe deleterious effects to the organism. Metabolic profiling by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) of adult flies at selected ages post Abeta42 expression onset reveals characteristic changes in metabolites as early markers of the pathological process. All morphological and most metabolic features of Abeta42 toxicity can be suppressed by the joint overexpression of PI3K.
