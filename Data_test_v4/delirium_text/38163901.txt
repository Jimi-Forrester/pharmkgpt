38163901|a|Despite continued advances in prevention and treatment strategies, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain the leading cause of death worldwide, and more effective therapeutic methods are urgently needed. Polygonatum is a traditional Chinese herbal medicine with a variety of pharmacological applications and biological activities, such as antioxidant activity, anti-inflammation, antibacterial effect, immune-enhancing effect, glucose regulation, lipid-lowering and anti-atherosclerotic effects, treatment of diabetes and anticancer effect. There has also been more and more evidence to support the cardioprotective effect of Polygonatum in recent years. However, up to now, there has been a lack of comprehensive studies on the active ingredients and their pharmacotoxicological effects related to cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, the main active components of Polygonatum (including Polysaccharides, Flavonoids, Saponins) and their biological activities were firstly reviewed in this paper. Furthermore, we summarized the pharmacological effects of Polygonatum's active components in preventing and treating CVDs, and its relevant toxicological investigations. Finally, we emphasize the potential of Polygonatum in the prevention and treatment of CVDs.
