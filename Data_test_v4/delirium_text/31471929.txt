31471929|a|Abnormally high brain iron, resulting from the disrupted expression or function of proteins involved in iron metabolism in the brain, is an initial cause of neuronal death in neuroferritinopathy and aceruloplasminemia, and also plays a causative role in at least some of the other neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and Friedreich's ataxia. As such, iron is believed to be a novel target for pharmacological intervention in these disorders. Reducing iron toward normal levels or hampering the increases in iron associated with age in the brain is a promising therapeutic strategy for all iron-related neurodegenerative disorders. Hepcidin is a crucial regulator of iron homeostasis in the brain. Recent studies have suggested that upregulating brain hepcidin levels can significantly reduce brain iron content through the regulation of iron transport protein expression in the blood-brain barrier and in neurons and astrocytes. In this review, we focus on the discussion of the therapeutic potential of hepcidin in iron-associated neurodegenerative diseases and also provide a systematic overview of recent research progress on how misregulated brain iron metabolism is involved in the development of multiple neurodegenerative disorders.
