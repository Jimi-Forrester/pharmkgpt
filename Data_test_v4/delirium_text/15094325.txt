15094325|t|Disclosure of a pro-apoptotic glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase promoter: anti-dementia drugs depress its activation in apoptosis.
15094325|a|Overexpression and subsequent nuclear accumulation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) is involved in neuronal apoptosis induced by several stimuli in which GAPDH antisense oligonucleotides specifically block the increment (2 approximately 3 fold) of GAPDH mRNA contents occurring prior to neuronal death. However, these agents do not affect the basal, constitutive mRNA contents. This suggests that there may be distinct gene regulations for GAPDH mRNA expression. Herein, we cloned two types of promoter regions upstream of this gene; viz., #104 (1.02-kb) and #302 (2.46-kb). These fragments were inserted into the pGL3 luciferase reporter system and transiently transfected into cultured cerebellar neurons undergoing cytosine arabinonucleoside-induced apoptosis. The functional analysis of these constructs revealed that #104, but not #302, increased luciferase activity in response to the apoptotic stimulus. Deletion and replacement mutation analysis of the #104 fragment disclosed the promoter core harbored between the 154-bp and 84-bp domains (3.5-fold activity of the control). Furthermore, anti-dementia drugs (such as Cognex and Aricept) markedly depress the expression of this pro-apoptotic GAPDH promoter activity. Interestingly, immunocytochemical examination of human post-mortem materials from patients with Alzheimer's disease revealed nuclear aggregated GAPDH in neurons of the affected brain regions, implying an association with apoptotic cell death. The current findings indicate that induction of the pro-apoptotic protein GAPDH is genetically regulated at the level of promoter activation, and this protein may be an important molecular target for developing anti-apoptotic therapeutic agents in certain neurological illnesses.
