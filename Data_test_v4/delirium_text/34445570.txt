34445570|t|Kahweol Exerts Skin Moisturizing Activities by Upregulating STAT1 Activity.
34445570|a|Kahweol is a diterpene present in coffee. Until now, several studies have shown that kahweol has anti-inflammatory and anti-angiogenic functions. Due to the limited research available about skin protection, this study aims to discern the potential abilities of kahweol and the possible regulation targets. First, the cytotoxicity of kahweol was checked by 3-4-5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2-5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, while 2,20-azino-bis (3ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) diammonium salt and 1-diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazyl were used to examine the radical scavenging ability. Polymerase chain reaction analysis was performed to explore the proper time points and doses affecting skin hydration and barrier-related genes. Luciferase assay and Western blotting were used to explore the possible transcription factors. Finally, fludarabine (a STAT1 inhibitor) was chosen to discern the relationship between skin-moisturizing factors and STAT1. We found that HaCaT cells experienced no toxicity from kahweol, and kahweol displayed moderate radical scavenging ability. Moreover, kahweol increased the outcome of HAS1, HAS2, occludin, and TGM-1 from six hours in a dose-dependent manner as well as the activation of STAT1 from six hours. Additionally, kahweol recovered the suppression of HAS2, STAT1-mediated luciferase activity, and HA secretion, which was all downregulated by fludarabine. In this study, we demonstrated that kahweol promotes skin-moisturizing activities by upregulating STAT1.
