37133369|t|Diagnostic challenges for dementia in Australia: are blood-based biomarkers the solution?
37133369|a|The burden of dementia will increase as the Australian population ages and grows in coming decades. Early and accurate diagnosis remains challenging, and disproportionately so for particular groups, including rural communities. Recent advances in technology, however, now allow reliable measurement of blood biomarkers that could improve diagnosis in a range of settings. We discuss the most promising biomarker candidates for translation into clinical practice and research in the near future.
