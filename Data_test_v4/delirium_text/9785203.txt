9785203|t|Neurologic complications after coronary artery bypass grafting.
9785203|a|Although outcomes from coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery have improved in general, there has been little or no improvement in the incidence of postoperative stroke or neurologic dysfunction. Several studies have identified factors that increase the CABG patient's risk for developing a stroke and neurologic complications. It is important to identify those patients at increased risk and differentiate among stroke, delirium, and seizures. Post-CABG patients need to be monitored for neurological dysfunction with appropriate assessments. Neurologic complications must be appropriately managed to optimize patient recovery.
