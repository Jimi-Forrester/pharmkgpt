19543560|a|In the past 10 years, chronic drug abuse health problems have become complex medical-legal problems. These include Cocaine-Induced Agitated Delirium, an idiosyncratic illness appears 1-2 hours after regular drug intake and can cause death without overdose is detected at autopsy. This review studies the molecular changes caused by cocaine abuse that derived into Cocaine-Induced Agitated Delirium. The molecular-clinical correlation links the phenomena induced by the abuse expressed at different levels of complexity, from the biochemical to the social. The purpose here is to induce a greater awareness of this illness to improve its prevention, to obtain its early diagnosis and to achieve its appropriate therapeutic-legal approach. Cocaine-Induced Agitated Delirium should be considered as the result of several unseen changes, that if they reach a critical threshold trigger the fatal outcome. This makes the abuse of cocaine and the individual predisposition solely responsible for its appearance.
