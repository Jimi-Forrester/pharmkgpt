39446353|a|Purpose: Retinal ischemia-reperfusion (RIR) injury is implicated in various retinal diseases, leading to retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) degeneration. Microglial senescence exacerbates inflammation, contributing to neurodegeneration. This study aimed to investigate the potential therapeutic role of Roflumilast (Roflu) in ameliorating microglial senescence and neuroinflammation following RIR injury. Methods: C57BL/6J mice underwent RIR surgery, and Roflu treatment was administered intraperitoneally. BV2 microglial cells were subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation and reoxygenation (OGD/R) to simulate ischemic conditions in vitro. SA-beta-gal staining was used to detect cellular senescence. Quantitative PCR and ELISA were used to examine the levels of senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) factors. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was performed on retinal sections to assess retinal morphology and thickness. Surviving RGCs were labeled and quantified in retinal whole-mounts using immunofluorescence (IF). Furthermore, Western blot and IF staining were used to quantify the proteins associated with the cell cycle and NLRP3 inflammasomes. Results: Roflu treatment reduced microglial senescence, ROS production, and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines in OGD/R-exposed BV2 cells. It also restored cell proliferation capacity and reversed OGD/R-induced cell cycle arrest. In vivo, Roflu alleviated retinal senescence, preserved retinal thickness, and protected against RGCs death in the RIR mouse model. Mechanistically, Roflu inhibited the NLRP3 inflammasome activation and suppressed DNA damage signaling pathway in microglia. Conclusions: Roflu exerts neuroprotective effects by mitigating microglial senescence and inflammation via inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome in RIR injury. These findings suggest that Roflu may serve as a promising therapeutic strategy for retinal diseases associated with ischemic injury by targeting microglial senescence.
