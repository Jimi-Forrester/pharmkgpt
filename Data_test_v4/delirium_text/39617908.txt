39617908|a|BACKGROUND: Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is a growing health concern and the risk of its development is connected with the increasing prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) which occurs as a result of some complex obesity-induced metabolic changes. It is a common chronic liver disease characterized by excessive fat accumulation in the liver, the tendency to progress to more severe forms, and a corresponding increase in morbidity and mortality. Thus, effectively addressing the rising burden of the disease requires a thorough understanding of its complex interrelationship with obesity and MetS. MAIN BODY: MASLD results from complex interactions involving obesity, insulin resistance, and dyslipidaemia, leading to hepatic lipid accumulation, and is influenced by several genetic and environmental factors such as diet and gut microbiota dysbiosis. It has extensive metabolic and non-metabolic implications, including links to MetS components like hyperglycaemia, hypertension, and dyslipidaemia, and progresses to significant liver damage and other extra-hepatic risks like cardiovascular disease and certain cancers. Diagnosis often relies on imaging and histology, with non-invasive methods preferred over liver biopsies. Emerging biomarkers and OMIC technologies offer improved diagnostic capabilities but face practical challenges. Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), lifestyle interventions, and pharmacological treatments show promise, with future efforts focusing on precision medicine and novel diagnostic tools to improve patient outcome. CONCLUSION: Understanding the pathogenic mechanisms underlying the development of MASLD within the context of metabolic syndrome (MetS) is essential for identifying potential therapeutic targets. Advancements in non-invasive diagnostic tools and novel pharmacological treatments, hold promise for improving the management of MASLD. Future research should focus on precision medicine and innovative therapies to effectively address the disease and its consequences.
