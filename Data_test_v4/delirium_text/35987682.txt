35987682|a|BACKGROUND: Studies have demonstrated the efficacy of oxygen delivery-guided perfusion (ODGP) in preventing postoperative acute kidney injury, but the benefit of ODGP for delirium has not been confirmed. We retrospectively investigated the risk factors for postoperative delirium in patients who underwent ODGP (with oxygen delivery index [DO2i] > 300 mL/min/m2). METHODS: Consecutive patients who underwent on-pump cardiovascular surgery with ODGP from January 2018 to December 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. In addition to examining patients' DO2i during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), we quantified the two primary DO2 components-hematocrit (Hct) and pump flow. Delirium was defined based on the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC). Patients were divided into three groups: no delirium (ICDSC score = 0), subsyndromal delirium (ICDSC score = 1-3), and clinical delirium (ICDSC score >= 4). RESULTS: Multivariate analysis identified only the number of red blood cell (RBC) units transfused, intubation time, and the cumulative time below the Hct threshold of 25% as predictive factors of postoperative delirium. Although patients with higher ICDSC scores had greater hemodilution during CPB, ODGP resulted in a higher pump flow, and DO2i was maintained above 300 mL/min/m2, with no significant difference between the three groups. CONCLUSIONS: A low Hct level during CPB with ODGP, the number of RBC units transfused, and intubation time were associated with postoperative delirium. Further investigations are needed to determine the ability of ODGP to prevent low Hct during CPB.
