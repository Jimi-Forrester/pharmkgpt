The study aimed to determine the validity and reliability of the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC) in a resource-poor medical intensive care setting in South India. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-three patients admitted into the medical intensive care unit of a teaching hospital who were neither mute nor intubated were recruited for the study. Trained residents administered the ICDSC to screen for delirium. A consultant psychiatrist used the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision diagnostic criteria for research to determine the presence of delirium. RESULTS: The optimal threshold for screening, as ICDSC total score of 3 or more, was obtained by using a receiver operating characteristic curve. Although a sensitivity and specificity of 75% and 74%, respectively, were obtained at the original cutoff of 4, a sensitivity of 90% and specificity of 61.54% were achieved with a cutoff of 3. In a subsample of 21 patients, interrater reliability was evaluated and found to be 0.947 (95% confidence interval, 0.870-0.979). The ICDSC had good internal consistency, with Cronbach alpha of .754 and Guttman split-half coefficient of 0.71. Factor analysis revealed a 2-factor structure, namely, altered sensorium/psychopathology and sleep-wake cycle problems. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that in nonintubated intensive care unit patients, the ICDSC can be used to screen for delirium but should not be used as a diagnostic instrument in this patient population and that residents can be trained in the use of the instrument in resource-poor critical care settings. Using a different threshold for positivity of 3 rather than 4 appeared to offer improved screening characteristics in this resource-poor critical care setting.
