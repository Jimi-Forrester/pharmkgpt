35454791|a|The landscape of healthcare delivery has considerably changed due to the emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This is nowhere more evident than in the care of advanced cancer patients receiving palliative care. This population is susceptible to the severe complications of COVID-19, and immediate measures had to be taken to ensure their safety. Thus, the adoption of telemedicine as a health care delivery model emerged.

This narrative review provides an overview of the unique benefits and barriers of telemedicine in palliative care patients.
