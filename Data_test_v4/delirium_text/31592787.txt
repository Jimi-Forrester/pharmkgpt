31592787|t|Not just to survive but to thrive: delirium in the pediatric cardiac ICU.
31592787|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Pediatric delirium has recently been recognized to occur frequently in the pediatric general and cardiac ICU. The purpose of this review is to highlight recent data on the prevalence, prevention, and management of this condition. RECENT FINDINGS: Pediatric delirium occurs in the pediatric cardiac ICU (PCICU) in as many as 67% of patients. Validated screening tools are now available to assist clinicians in the diagnosis of this condition. Research has shown a growing relationship between benzodiazepines, mainstays in the realm of sedation, and delirium. The full spectrum of risk factors has yet to be clearly elucidated. After normalization of the ICU environment, antipsychotics are infrequently required for treatment. While pediatric delirium has been associated with increased length of stay and cost, long-term morbidities are unknown at this time. SUMMARY: Application of bundles to normalize the PCICU environment may lead to decreased incidence of pediatric delirium. Multiinstitutional studies are indicated to further delineate optimal bundles, stratify treatment strategies, and investigate long-term morbidity in pediatric delirium.
