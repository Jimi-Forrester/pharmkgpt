28555076|a|Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for schizophrenia have identified over 100 loci encoding >500 genes. It is unclear whether any of these genes, other than dopamine receptor D2, are immediately relevant to antipsychotic effects or represent novel antipsychotic targets. We applied an in vivo molecular approach to this question by performing RNA sequencing of brain tissue from mice chronically treated with the antipsychotic haloperidol or vehicle. We observed significant enrichments of haloperidol-regulated genes in schizophrenia GWAS loci and in schizophrenia-associated biological pathways. Our findings provide empirical support for overlap between genetic variation underlying the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and the molecular effects of a prototypical antipsychotic.
