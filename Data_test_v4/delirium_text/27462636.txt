27462636|a|BACKGROUND: Noncommunicable diseases such as Hypertension are among the important factors of mortality and morbidity of the elderly people. The family-centered empowerment model (FCEM) has not been performed for elderly people with hypertension. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: This clinical trial study was carried out on 62 elderly people with hypertension under the coverage of the Lenjan Health Network in 2013. After performing the sampling by using the cluster-randomized method, the samples were divided randomly into the experimental and control groups. METHODS: For the experimental group, the (FCEM) was implemented based on the four steps. For the control group, it was only implemented the usual care and one training session. Research tools included questionnaires of demographic data, empowerment assessment and a blood pressure-measuring device. The post-test was performed 1 week later. The blood pressure was recorded, and it was followed 1.5 month later again. STATISTICAL TESTS: Statistical tests for data analysis included chi(2)-test, independent t-test, Mann-Whitney, analysis of variance, and SPSS 20. RESULTS: 1 week later and 1.5 month after the intervention, the mean blood pressure was significant in both groups (P < 0.001). also, the difference in the mean score of empowerment dimensions was significant in the experimental group 1 week later and 1.5 month after the intervention (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Implementation of the FCEM for elderly people with hypertension has been possible from a practical point of view, and it has been associated with controlling and improving the blood pressure.
