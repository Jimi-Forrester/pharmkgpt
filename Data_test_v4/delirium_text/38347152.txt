38347152|t|Post-extubation dysphagia in pediatric trauma patients: a single-center case-series study.
38347152|a|We aimed to investigate whether ventilator support time influences the occurrence of dysphagia in pediatric trauma patients. This case-series study was conducted in a single pediatric emergency and critical care center from April 2012 to March 2022. Trauma patients aged < 16 years who underwent tracheal intubation were divided into two groups based on the occurrence of dysphagia within 72 h after extubation, and their data were analyzed. Tracheal intubation was performed in 75 pediatric trauma patients, and 53 of them were included in the analysis. A total of 22 patients had post-extubation dysphagia and head trauma. The dysphagia group tended to have more severe head injuries (Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) 4 [4-5] vs. 4 [0-4]; p < 0.05), a longer ventilator support time (7 days [4-11] vs. 1 day [1-2.5]; p < 0.05), and a longer length of hospital stay (27 days [18.0-40.3] vs. 11 days [10.0-21.0]; p < 0.05). Severe head trauma and a long duration of tracheal intubation may be risk factors for dysphagia in pediatric trauma patients. Therefore, early recognition of these risk factors could assist in treatment planning for speech-language pathologist intervention and nutritional routes of administration.
