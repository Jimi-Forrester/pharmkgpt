39791202|a|This review examines the role of the canine blood-brain barrier (BBB) in health and disease, focusing on the impact of the multidrug resistance (MDR) transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp) encoded by the ABCB1/MDR1 gene. The BBB is critical in maintaining central nervous system homeostasis and brain protection against xenobiotics and environmental drugs that may be circulating in the blood stream. We revise key anatomical, histological and functional aspects of the canine BBB and examine the role of the ABCB1/MDR1 gene mutation in specific dog breeds that exhibit reduced P-gp activity and disrupted drug brain pharmacokinetics. The review also covers factors that may disrupt the canine BBB, including the actions of aging, canine cognitive dysfunction, epilepsy, inflammation, infection, traumatic brain injury, among others. We highlight the critical importance of this barrier in maintaining central nervous system homeostasis and protecting against xenobiotics and conclude that a number of neurological-related diseases may increase vulnerability of the BBB in the canine species and discuss its profound impacts on canine health.
