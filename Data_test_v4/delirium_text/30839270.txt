30839270|t|Systematic Review of Yoga and Balance: Effect on Adults With Neuromuscular Impairment.
30839270|a|This systematic review examines the efficacy of yoga as a neuromuscular intervention for community-dwelling populations at risk for falls to determine its utility for use in occupational therapy intervention. Populations included older adults and adults with traumatic brain injury (TBI), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD)-type dementia, multiple sclerosis (MS), and Parkinson's disease (PD). Benefits of yoga include improved posture control, improved flexibility of mind and body, relaxation, and decreased anxiety and stress. A systematic review of the literature was conducted to understand the salutary benefits of yoga for clients who are at risk for falls because of neuromuscular issues. Moderate evidence supports the use of yoga to decrease the risk for falls for community-dwelling older adults and people with CVA, dementia and AD-type dementia, and MS. Studies involving people with TBI and PD did not include strong enough evidence to be able to make a clear classification.
