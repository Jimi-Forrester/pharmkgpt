38030711|t|Inhibition of asparagine endopeptidase (AEP) effectively treats sporadic Alzheimer's disease in mice.
38030711|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease with cognitive dysfunction as its major clinical symptom. However, there is no disease-modifying small molecular medicine to effectively slow down progression of the disease. Here, we show an optimized asparagine endopeptidase (AEP, also known as delta-secretase) inhibitor, #11 A, that displays an orderly in vivo pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) relationship and robustly attenuates AD pathologies in a sporadic AD mouse model. #11 A is brain permeable with great oral bioavailability. It blocks AEP cleavage of APP and Tau dose-dependently, and significantly decreases Abeta40 and Abeta42 and p-Tau levels in APP/PS1 and Tau P301S mice after oral administration. Notably, #11 A strongly inhibits AEP and prevents mouse APP and Tau fragmentation by AEP, leading to reduction of mouse Abeta42 (mAbeta42), mAbeta40 and mouse p-Tau181 levels in Thy1-ApoE4/C/EBPbeta transgenic mice in a dose-dependent manner. Repeated oral administration of #11 A substantially decreases mAbeta aggregation as validated by Abeta PET assay, Tau pathology, neurodegeneration and brain volume reduction, resulting in alleviation of cognitive impairment. Therefore, our results support that #11 A is a disease-modifying preclinical candidate for pharmacologically treating AD.
