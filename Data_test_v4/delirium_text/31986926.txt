31986926|t|Misconnecting the dots: altered mitochondrial protein-protein interactions and their role in neurodegenerative disorders.
31986926|a|Introduction: Mitochondria (mt) are protein-protein interaction (PPI) hubs in the cell where mt-localized and associated proteins interact in a fashion critical for cell fitness. Altered mtPPIs are linked to neurodegenerative disorders (NDs) and drivers of pathological associations to mediate ND progression. Mapping altered mtPPIs will reveal how mt dysfunction is linked to NDs.Areas covered: This review discusses how database sources reflect on the number of mt protein or interaction predictions, and serves as an update on mtPPIs in mt dynamics and homeostasis. Emphasis is given to mRNA expression profiles for mt proteins in human tissues, cellular models relevant to NDs, and altered mtPPIs in NDs such as Parkinson's disease (PD), Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Alzheimer's disease (AD).Expert opinion: We highlight the scarcity of biomarkers to improve diagnostic accuracy and tracking of ND progression, obstacles in recapitulating NDs using human cellular models to underpin the pathophysiological mechanisms of disease, and the shortage of mt protein interactome reference database(s) of neuronal cells. These bottlenecks are addressed by improvements in induced pluripotent stem cell creation and culturing, patient-derived 3D brain organoids to recapitulate structural arrangements of the brain, and cell sorting to elucidate mt proteome disparities between cell types.
