31914092|a|Inappropriate care for patients with cognitive dysfunction in the hospital could worsen quality of care and medical service satisfaction.All elderly participants were recruited from acute wards of 5 departments in an university hospital. They were administered the Chinese version of Ascertain Dementia 8 (AD8) at admission and the Nursing Service Satisfaction Questionnaire before discharge.A total of 345 participants completed the study. There were 91 (26.4%) participants with AD8 >= 2, the cut-off value of high risk of dementia. The prevalence was much higher than prior community-based reports. The Nursing Service Satisfaction Score was significantly lower in AD8 >= 2 than in AD8 < 2 (56.99 +- 0.94 vs 60.55 +- 0.48, P < .01).Using AD8 in hospital-based screening might be more efficient than in the community in terms of cost-effectiveness due to higher positive rate and easier approach to diagnostic facilities. AD8 >= 2 is also an indicator to identify care dissatisfaction among inpatients. By identifying patients with cognitive dysfunction, such as its related communication barriers, care systems could be tailored for more friendly services.
