32663608|a|Protein aggregation diseases involve intracellular accumulation or extracellular deposition of certain protein species in neuronal or glial cells, leading to neurodegeneration and shortened lifespan. Prime examples include Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Huntington's disease (HD), which are affected by overlapping or specific aggregation-prone proteins. Mounting evidence suggests that dysfunctional glial cells may be major drivers for some diseases, and when they are not causal factors, they could still significantly exacerbate or alleviate disease progression by playing a plethora of detrimental or beneficial roles. Here we review the diverse functions performed by glial cells in a variety of protein aggregation diseases, highlighting the complexity of the issue and the interconnected relationships between these multifaceted effects.
