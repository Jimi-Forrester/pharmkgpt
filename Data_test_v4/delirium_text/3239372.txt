3239372|a|A nuclear gray is found in the human pontine tegmentum close to the lower circumference of the superior cerebellar peduncle and is located within the pedunculo-lemniscal trigone. It is mainly characterized by the presence of medium-sized neuro-melanin-containing neurons and, therefore, referred to as the pigmented subpeduncular nucleus. Three basic neuronal types occur within the boundaries of the nucleus. Scattered among the neuromelanin-containing type I nerve cells are type II cells with lipofuscin deposits and type III neurons devoid of any pigmentation. In cases of Alzheimer-type dementia, the pigmented subpeduncular nucleus shows severe changes. Neurofibrillary tangles can frequently be found within the somata of both the melanin-laden and the lipofuscin-containing neurons. In contrast, the non-pigmented nerve cells remain devoid of such pathological filaments. Furthermore, large numbers of neuropil threads are scattered throughout the nuclear gray.
