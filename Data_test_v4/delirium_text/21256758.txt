21256758|a|Carbon-11-labeled bivalent beta-carbolines, 9,9'-(pentane-1,5-diyl)bis(2-[(11)C]methyl-9H-pyrido[3,4-b]indol-2-ium)iodide ([(11)C]2a), 9,9'-(nonane-1,9-diyl)bis(2-[(11)C]methyl-9H-pyrido[3,4-b]indol-2-ium)iodide ([(11)C]2b), 9,9'-(dodecane-1,12-diyl)bis(2-[(11)C]methyl-9H-pyrido[3,4-b]indol-2-ium)iodide ([(11)C]2c) and 1,9-bis(2-[(11)C]methyl-3,4-dihydro-1H-pyrido[3,4-b]indol-9(2H)-yl)nonane ([(11)C]3), were prepared by N-[(11)C]methylation of their corresponding amine precursors using [(11)C]CH(3)I and isolated by either a simplified solid-phase extraction (SPE) method or HPLC in 40-60% radiochemical yields based on [(11)C]CO(2) and decay corrected to end of bombardment (EOB). The overall synthesis time from EOB was 20-30min, the radiochemical purity was >99%, and the specific activity at end of synthesis (EOS) was 185-370 GBq/mumol.
