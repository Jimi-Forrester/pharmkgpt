30984859|t|Entrustable Professional Activity 10: Case Simulation and Assessment-STEMI With Cardiac Arrest.
30984859|a|INTRODUCTION: Entrustable professional activities (EPAs) are units of professional practice defined as tasks or responsibilities that trainees are entrusted to perform unsupervised. AAMC Core EPA 10 is defined as the ability to "recognize a patient who requires emergent care and initiate evaluation and management." We designed a simulation scenario to elicit EPA 10-related behaviors for learner assessment to guide entrustment decisions. METHODS: This case presents a 61-year-old male with a complaint of feeling ill. The students need to diagnose an ST segment elevation myocardial infarction that leads to a pulseless ventricular tachycardia arrest. A simulation manikin is used, and students are assessed using a checklist. The tool is a set of critical actions that were proposed by a group of content experts, based on the following EPA 10 functions: recognizing unstable vital signs, asking for help, and determining appropriate disposition. In addition to case-specific behavioral items, an overall entrustment item was added to inform the entrustment decision. RESULTS: This case was implemented in a mandatory fourth-year clerkship for 7 years prior to its adaptation for entrustment on EPA 10. In recent experience from one institution, about 14% of students failed to meet entrustment. Students rated the experience as valuable (average 5.0, on a 5-point Likert scale) and thought that it would change their performance in a clinical setting (average 4.95, on a 5-point Likert scale). DISCUSSION: Faculty raters noted challenges regarding entrustment based on a single simulation and the implications that team role (supporting role vs. leader role) has on entrustment.
