39317458|t|Expression of microRNA induced by postoperative delirium-like behavior is associated with long-term default mode network disruption: Sequencing and a secondary analysis of resting-state fMRI data.
39317458|a|AIMS: Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) has been widely used in studying default mode network (DMN) changes in postoperative delirium (POD). Reproducibility and interpretability of the analyzing results remain insufficiently studied. METHODS: Delirium-like behavior was induced by tibial fixation surgery under isoflurane anesthesia. Firstly, we evaluated delirium-like behavior and inflammatory responses in hippocampus and systemic level. Then the expressions of microRNA (miRNA) and target gene were sequenced and validated. Afterwards the functional connectivity (FC) in DMN was analyzed. Finally, results were correlated with DMN changes. RESULTS: POD-like behavior caused significant changes of miR-34b-5p, miR-328-5p, and miR-3505 in miRNA level and Nos1, Tubb3, and Gys1 in the gene level. The FC in left and right hippocampus (L-Hip and R-Hip) and right auditory cortex (R-AC) was found significantly changed. Significant correlations were found in FCL-Hip/R-AC and FCR-Hip/R-AC for miR-34b-5p and miR-3505, as well as Nos1 and Tubb3. For miR-328-5p, no significant correlations were found. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that POD-like behavior induced significant miRNA and gene expression changes were associated with hippocampus related long-term FC disruption in DMN. The results increased reproducibility and interpretability for standardized rs-fMRI data analysis, as well as providing potential targets for postoperative delirium treatment.
