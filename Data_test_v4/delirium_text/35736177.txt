35736177|t|Genus Nocardiopsis: A Prolific Producer of Natural Products.
35736177|a|Actinomycetes are currently one of the major sources of bioactive secondary metabolites used for medicine development. Accumulating evidence has shown that Nocardiopsis, a key class of actinomycetes, has the ability to produce novel bioactive natural products. This review covers the sources, distribution, bioactivities, biosynthesis, and structural characteristics of compounds isolated from Nocardiopsis in the period between March 2018 and 2021. Our results reveal that 67% of Nocardiopsis-derived natural products are reported for the first time, and 73% of them are isolated from marine Nocardiopsis. The chemical structures of the Nocardiopsis-derived compounds have diverse skeletons, concentrating on the categories of polyketides, peptides, terphenyls, and alkaloids. Almost 50% of the natural products isolated from Nocardiopsis have been discovered to display various bioactivities. These results fully demonstrate the great potential of the genus Nocardiopsis to produce novel bioactive secondary metabolites that may serve as a structural foundation for the development of novel drugs.
