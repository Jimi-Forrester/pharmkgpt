38254925|t|The Effects of Nine Compounds on Aldehyde-Oxidase-Related Genes in Bactrocera dorsalis (Hendel).
38254925|a|Bactrocera dorsalis (Hendel) (Diptera: Tephritidae) (B. dorsalis) is an important agricultural, major invasive, and quarantine pest that can cause significant damage to the economic value of the fruit and vegetable industry. Male bait is one of the most effective methods of surveying, monitoring, and controlling B. dorsalis. In our study, we constructed cDNA libraries using total RNA extracted independently from the antennae, mouthparts, and thoracic legs of male and female adults and the ovipositors of female adults and screened out four aldehyde-oxidase-related genes (AOX-related), C58800, C66700, C67485, and C67698. Molecular docking predictions showed that eight compounds, including 3,4-dimethoxycinnamyl alcohol, 3,4-dimethoxy-cinnamaldehyde, deet, ethyl N-acetyl-N-butyl-beta-alaninate, n-butyl butyrate, n-butyl butyrate, ethyl butyrate, methyl eugenol, and ethyl acetate, could combine with proteins encoded by the four B. dorsalis AOX-related genes. Furthermore, QPCR was performed to confirm that four compounds, including 3,4-dimethoxy cinnamic aldehyde, butyl levulinic acid ethyl ester (mosquito repellent), butyl butyrate, and methyl eugenol, induced significant changes in the AOX-related genes of B. dorsalis. These results provide useful information and guidance for the batch screening of potentially useful compounds and the search for effective attractants of B. dorsalis.
