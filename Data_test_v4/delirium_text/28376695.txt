28376695|t|Added value and limitations of amyloid-PET imaging: review and analysis of selected cases of mild cognitive impairment and dementia.
28376695|a|Amyloid-positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of the brain detects elevated amyloid-beta (amyloid-beta) neuritic plaques in vivo, which can be helpful in appropriately selected cases of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia, when Alzheimer's disease remains a possible etiology, after a comprehensive clinical evaluation. We reviewed cases of cognitively impaired patients who underwent amyloid-PET imaging because of diagnostic uncertainty. Pre- and post-PET elements of diagnosis and management were first compared, to assess impact of scan results on clinical decision-making, and then an analysis of those decisions was undertaken in appropriate clinical situations, to delineate the added value and limitations of amyloid-PET imaging. The potential benefits and limitations of this diagnostic tool are important to understand in an era when the utility of such scans in clinical practice is evolving.
