2077436|t|Magnesium, schizophrenia and manic-depressive disease.
2077436|a|Plasma magnesium (Mg) levels were estimated in 15 schizophrenic, 10 depressed, 6 manic and 6 presenile Alzheimer's disease patients and compared with those in 303 healthy controls. The schizophrenic and depressed patients showed lower levels, but the levels were normal in the other two groups. Mg levels increased on achieving clinical remission in the schizophrenic patients. A hypothesis is proposed according to which the high level of stress found in severely ill psychiatric patients can lead to marginal Mg deficiency in susceptible individuals. This could exacerbate symptoms such as anxiety, fear, hallucinations, weakness and somatic complaints.
