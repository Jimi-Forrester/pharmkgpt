1629942|t|beta-Amyloid precursor protein of Alzheimer's disease in cultured bovine oligodendrocytes.
1629942|a|The production of beta-amyloid precursor protein (beta APP) in cultured oligodendrocytes isolated from adult bovine brains was examined by immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting. Immunostaining of oligodendrocytes with antibodies specific for the carboxy terminus of beta APP demonstrated positive immunoreactivity of oligodendroglial cytoplasm. Immunoblot analysis of cellular extracts detected two distinct bands with estimated molecular weight of 118 and 105 kDa. The amount of these beta APP subspecies increased considerably in response to their attachment to the poly-L-lysine substratum.
