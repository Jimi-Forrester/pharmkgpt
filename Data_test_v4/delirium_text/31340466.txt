31340466|t|Instrumental Activities of Daily Living: The Processes Involved in and Performance of These Activities by Japanese Community-Dwelling Older Adults with Subjective Memory Complaints.
31340466|a|Subjective memory complaints (SMCs) may predict the onset of dementia. The purpose of this study was to clarify characteristics of performance of activities of daily living (ADL) for older adults with SMCs and to offer support options that enable them to maintain their community-based lifestyle. A self-administered questionnaire was sent to 2000 randomly selected members of CO-OP Kagoshima, and 621 responded. 270 responders answered all questions were categorized into SMC (+) group and SMC (-) group (n = 133). Participants were evaluated the Process Analysis of Daily Activity for Dementia. A 2-sample t-test or the Chi-square test were used to compare the averages of continuous variables or the proportions of categorical variables. The results showed the SMC (+) group ranked significantly lower in ability to use the telephone, shop, cook, do housekeeping, manage finances, and manage medications compared with the SMC (-) group. In addition, the SMC (+) group was significantly less independent than the SMC (-) group in many processes requiring the use of tools, operation of machines, management of goods, selection of tools, and monitoring. To enable continued independence of older adults' experiencing SMCs, it may be important to analyze their performance of ADL and to develop plans for supporting their strengths.
