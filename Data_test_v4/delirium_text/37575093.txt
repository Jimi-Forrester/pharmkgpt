37575093|t|Sex-specific associations between nine metal mixtures in urine and urine flow rate in US adults: NHANES 2009-2018.
37575093|a|Background: The urinary system serves as a crucial pathway for eliminating metallic substances from the body, making it susceptible to the effects of metal exposure. However, limited research has explored the association between metal mixtures and bladder function. This study aims to investigate the relationship between urinary metal mixtures (specifically barium, cadmium, cobalt, cesium, molybdenum, lead, antimony, thallium, and tungsten) and urine flow rate (UFR) in the general population, utilizing multiple mixture analysis models. Methods: This study utilizes data obtained from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. After adjusting for relevant covariates, we assessed the correlations between metal mixtures and UFR using three distinct analysis models: weighted quantile sum (WQS), quantile g-computation (qgcomp), and Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR). Additionally, a gender-stratified analysis was conducted. Finally, we also performed sensitivity analyses. Results: A total of 7,733 subjects were included in this study, with 49% being male. The WQS regression model, when fitted in the positive direction, did not yield any significant correlations in the overall population or in the male and female subgroups. However, when analyzed in the negative direction, the WQS index exhibited a negative correlation with UFR in the overall group (beta = -0.078; 95% CI: -0.111, -0.045). Additionally, a significant negative correlation between the WQS index and UFR was observed in the female group (beta = -0.108; 95% CI: -0.158, -0.059), while no significant correlation was found in the male group. The results obtained from the qgcomp regression model were consistent with those of the WQS regression model. Similarly, the BKMR regression model revealed a significant negative correlation trend between metal mixtures and UFR, with cadmium and antimony potentially playing key roles. Conclusion: Our study revealed a significant negative correlation between urinary metal mixture exposure and mean UFR in US adults, with notable gender differences. Specifically, higher urinary levels of cadmium and antimony were identified as potential key factors contributing to the decrease in mean UFR. These findings significantly contribute to the existing knowledge on the impact of metal mixtures on bladder function and provide valuable insights for safeguarding bladder health and preventing impaired bladder function.
