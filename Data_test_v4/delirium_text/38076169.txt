38076169|a|Objectives: This experiment investigated the role of the FAD-dependent oxidoreductase domain-containing 2 (FOXRED2) in the development of cutaneous malignant melanoma. Methods: We explored the expression and prognostic effects of FOXRED2 in cutaneous malignant melanoma by performing bioinformatics analyses and immunohistochemical staining experiments and verified the biological influence of FOXRED2 on human melanoma cells using in vitro experiments. Results: FOXRED2 expression was significantly higher in cutaneous malignant melanoma compared to normal skin and nevus tissues and closely associated with prognosis. The expression levels of FOXRED2 mRNA and protein were significantly upregulated in human melanoma cell lines, and knocking down FOXRED2 expression inhibits proliferation, invasion, and migration, promotes apoptosis, and alters tumor cell biology in A2058 and A375 cells. Conclusion: FOXRED2 may play a crucial role in the development and progression of cutaneous malignant melanoma.
