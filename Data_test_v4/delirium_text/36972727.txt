36972727|a|OBJECTIVES: Detection of alpha-synuclein aggregates by seed amplification is a promising Parkinson disease biomarker assay. Understanding intraindividual relationships of alpha-synuclein measures could inform optimal biomarker development. The objectives were to test accuracy of alpha-synuclein seed amplification assay in central (cerebrospinal fluid) and peripheral (submandibular gland) sources, compare to total alpha-synuclein measures, and investigate within-subject relationships. METHODS: The Systemic Synuclein Sampling Study aimed to characterize alpha-synuclein in multiple tissues and biofluids within Parkinson disease subjects (n = 59) and compared to healthy controls (n = 21). Motor and non-motor measures and dopamine transporter scans were obtained. Four measures of alpha-synuclein were compared: seed amplification assay in cerebrospinal fluid and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded submandibular gland, total alpha-synuclein quantified in biofluids using enzyme-linked immunoassay, and aggregated alpha-synuclein in submandibular gland detected by immunohistochemistry. Accuracy of seed amplification assay for Parkinson disease diagnosis was examined and within-subject alpha-synuclein measures were compared. RESULTS: Sensitivity and specificity of alpha-synuclein seed amplification assay for Parkinson disease diagnosis was 92.6% and 90.5% in cerebrospinal fluid, and 73.2% and 78.6% in submandibular gland, respectively. 25/38 (65.8%) Parkinson disease participants were positive for both cerebrospinal fluid and submandibular gland seed amplification assay. Comparing accuracy for Parkinson disease diagnosis of different alpha-synuclein measures, cerebrospinal fluid seed amplification assay was the highest (Youden Index = 83.1%). 98.3% of all Parkinson disease cases had >=1 measure of alpha-synuclein positive. INTERPRETATION: alpha-synuclein seed amplification assay (cerebrospinal fluid>submandibular gland) had higher sensitivity and specificity compared to total alpha-synuclein measures, and within-subject relationships of central and peripheral alpha-synuclein measures emerged.
