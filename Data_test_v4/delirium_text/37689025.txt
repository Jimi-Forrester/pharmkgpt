37689025|a|BACKGROUND: Hearing impairment is an established independent risk factor for delirium.Whether preoperative hearing impairment is associated with postoperative emergence agitation (POEA) in elderly patients remains unknown. This study aimed to investigate the association between preoperative hearing impairment and POEA in elderly patients undergoing ear surgery. METHODS: This prospective observational study was carried out at an otologic centre in a tertiary hospital between July 15, 2020, and February 28, 2021. Data of 417 elderly patients who underwent microscopic and endoscopic middle ear surgery were analyzed. Pure tone average was used to assess preoperative hearing function, with a PTA >= 50 dB indicating severe hearing impairment. POEA was measured using the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale. Multiple logistic regression was used to determine the association between preoperative hearing function and POEA. RESULTS: Of the 417 participants, 45.8% were men, and the median age was 64 (interquartile range: 62-67) years old. Severe preoperative hearing impairment was present in 113 patients (27.1%), and POEA occurred in 42 patients (10.1%). Multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that severe preoperative hearing impairment was associated with an increased risk of POEA (odds ratio: 2.031; 95% confidence interval: 1.044-3.954, P = 0.037). CONCLUSION: Pending confirmative studies, these findings suggest that severe preoperative hearing impairment could serve as an independent predictor of POEA in older patients undergoing middle ear surgery. These results highlight the need for further research to better understand the biomarker and pathogenesis of POEA, leading to identification of targeted interventions of POEA and improvement of postoperative outcomes in patients.
