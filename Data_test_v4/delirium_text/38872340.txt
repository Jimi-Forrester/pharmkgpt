38872340|t|Nobody's Perfect: Choice of the Buffer and the Rate of Cu2+ Ion-Peptide Interaction.
38872340|a|The choice of correct pH buffer is crucial in chemical studies modeling biological processes involving Cu2+ ions. Popular buffers for physiological pH are known to form Cu(II) complexes, but their impact on kinetics of Cu(II) complexation has not been considered. We performed a stopped-flow kinetic study of Cu2+ ion interactions with four popular buffers (phosphate, Tris, HEPES, and MOPS) and two buffers considered as nonbinding (MES and PIPPS). Next, we studied their effects on the rate of Cu2+ reaction with Gly-Gly-His (GGH), a tripeptide modeling physiological Cu(II) sites, which we studied previously at conditions presumably excluding the buffer interference [Kotuniak, R.; Angew. Chem., Int. Ed. 2020, 59, 11234-11239]. We observed that (i) all tested pH 7.4 buffers formed Cu(II) complexes within the stopped-flow instrument dead time; (ii) Cu(II)-peptide complexes were formed via ternary complexes with the buffers; (iii) nevertheless, Good buffers affected the observed rate of Cu(II)-GGH complex formation only slightly; (iv) Tris was a competitive inhibitor of Cu(II)-GGH complexation; while (v) phosphate was a reaction catalyst. This is particularly important as phosphate is a biological buffer.
