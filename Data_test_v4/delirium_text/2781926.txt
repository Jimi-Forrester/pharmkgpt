2781926|a|The study of clinical picture and the course of unclear pathological states simulating the vertebral pathology suggested that the major signs were centered around the primary general and muscular sensory disorders. These served as a basis for development of more complicated psychosensory and psychomotor disorders and creation of an interpretative hypochondriac++ delirium system. Domination of psychomotor disorders led to a high incidence of social and labor dysadaptation of the patients. Thus, the study of this unclear mental pathology has a major theoretic, clinico-psychopathological and also practical medico-social importance.
