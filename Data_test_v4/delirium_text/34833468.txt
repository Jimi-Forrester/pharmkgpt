34833468|t|Comparison of General and Spinal Anaesthesia on Systemic Inflammatory Response in Patients Undergoing Total Knee Arthroplasty: A Propensity Score Matching Analysis.
34833468|a|Background and Objectives: Some of the postoperative complications following orthopaedic surgeries are associated with a systemic inflammatory response (SIR), which varies depending on the anaesthetic technique. We aimed to compare the effects of general and spinal anaesthesia on the SIR after total knee arthroplasty (TKA), based on C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, the platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR). Materials and Methods: Patients who underwent TKA between January 2014 and December 2018 were included. Electronic medical records of the patients were retrospectively reviewed and analysed. To reduce the impact of potential confounding factors, we performed propensity score matching according to the anaesthetic technique. Results: A total of 1311 TKA cases were analysed. After propensity score matching, the maximal CRP value and changes in CRP levels in the general anaesthesia group were higher than those in the spinal anaesthesia group. However, the maximal NLR and PLR and the changes in NLR and PLR were not different between the two groups. There were no differences in postoperative clinical outcomes. Conclusion: Spinal anaesthesia tended to induce a lower inflammatory response than general anaesthesia when considering CRP levels in patients undergoing TKA. However, the effects of anaesthetic techniques on the overall outcomes were not significant.
