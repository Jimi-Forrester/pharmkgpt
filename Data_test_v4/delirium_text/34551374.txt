34551374|t|Relationship of APOE, age at onset, amyloid and clinical phenotype in Alzheimer disease.
34551374|a|The apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon4 allele is the most well-established risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), although its relationship to age at onset and clinical phenotype is unclear. We aimed to assess relationships between APOE genotype and age at onset, amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposition and typical versus atypical clinical presentations in AD. Frequency of APOE epsilon4 carriers by age at onset was assessed in 447 AD patients, 138 atypical AD patients recruited by the Neurodegenerative Research Group at Mayo Clinic, and 309 with typical AD from ADNI. APOE epsilon4 frequency increased with age at onset in atypical AD but showed a bell-shaped curve in typical AD where highest frequencies were observed between 65 and 70 years. Typical AD showed higher APOE epsilon4 frequencies than atypical AD only between the ages of 57 and 69 years. Global Abeta standard uptake value ratios did not differ according to APOE e4 status in either group. APOE genotype varies by both age at onset and clinical phenotype in AD, highlighting the heterogeneous nature of AD.
