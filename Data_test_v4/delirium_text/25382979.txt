25382979|t|Managing cardiovascular disease risk in patients treated with antipsychotics: a multidisciplinary approach.
25382979|a|BACKGROUND: The use of antipsychotic medication in the United States and throughout the world has greatly increased over the last fifteen years. These drugs have significant side effect burdens, many of them relating to cardiovascular health. OBJECTIVE: To review the available evidence on the major cardiovascular issues that arise in patients taking antipsychotic medication. METHOD: A PubMed literature review was performed to identify recent meta-analyses, review articles, and large studies. Further articles were identified through cited papers and based on expert consultation when necessary. RESULTS: CLINICAL GUIDANCE ON THE FOLLOWING ADVERSE EFFECTS AND ANTIPSYCHOTICS WAS REVIEWED: electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, (specifically, prolonged QT and risk of torsades de pointes), weight gain, dyslipidemia, metabolic syndrome, and myocarditis. Specific attention was paid to monitoring guidelines and treatment options in the event of adverse events, including dose change, medication switch, or adjuvant therapy.
