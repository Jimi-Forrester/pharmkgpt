20732815|t|Identification of a sub-micromolar, non-peptide inhibitor of beta-secretase with low neural cytotoxicity through in silico screening.
20732815|a|Nowadays identification of novel non-peptide beta-secretase (BACE-1, hereinafter) inhibitors with low cytotoxicity and good blood-brain barrier (BBB) property holds common interest of drug discovery for Alzheimer's disease. Twenty SPECS compounds were tested in BACE-1 FRET assays and methylthiazoletetrazolium (MTT) cytotoxicity experiment. Two compounds: 2 and 15 demonstrated IC(50) values of 0.53 and 9.4 muM. In addition, 2 showed least toxic effect to the neuroblastoma cells. The results from both in silico and in vitro studies provided new pharmacophoric entities for chemical synthesis and optimization on the current discovered BACE-1 small molecule inhibitors.
