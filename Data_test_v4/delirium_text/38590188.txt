38590188|a|Perceived threat of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) has been found a widespread phenomenon in developed countries, but has not yet been fully explored in developing countries. Analyzing data from 300 family caregivers of older adults with cognitive impairment in China, this study found caregiver burden was positively associated with the perceived threat of ADRD, and this association was buffered by higher family income and longer caregiving time. To alleviate undue ADRD concerns, it suggests expanding respite care and community elder care beds, and initiating education programs on reducing unnecessary worries about developing ADRD.
