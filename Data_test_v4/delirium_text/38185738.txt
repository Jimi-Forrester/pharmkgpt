38185738|a|Aluminum oxide nanoparticle (AlNP), a ubiquitous neurotoxin highly enriched in air pollution, is often produced as an inevitable byproduct in the manufacturing of industrial products such as cosmetics and metal materials. Meanwhile, ALNP has emerged as a significant public health concern due to its potential association with neurological diseases. However, the studies about the neurotoxic effects of AlNP are limited, partially due to the lack of physiologically relevant human neurovascular unit with innate immunity (hNVUI). Here, we employed our AlNP-treated hNVUI model to investigate the underlying mechanism of AlNP-driven neurodegeneration. First, we validated the penetration of AlNP across a blood-brain barrier (BBB) compartment and found AlNP-derived endothelial cellular senescence through the p16 and p53/p21 pathways. Our study showed that BBB-penetrating AlNP promoted reactive astrocytes, which produced a significant level of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The astrocytic neurotoxic factors caused neuronal damage, including the synaptic impairment, the accumulation of phosphoric-tau proteins, and even neuronal death. Our study suggests that AlNP could be a potential environmental risk factor of neurological disorders mediated by neuroinflammation.
