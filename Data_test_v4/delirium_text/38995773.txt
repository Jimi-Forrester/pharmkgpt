38995773|t|The Effects of Neuropsychiatric Symptom Clusters in People with Dementia on Family Caregiver Burden.
38995773|a|Background: Neuropsychiatric symptoms are a robust risk factor for caregiver burden in family dementia caregivers. By grouping these symptoms, clinical interpretations regarding neuropsychiatric symptoms may facilitated because different groups of symptoms may require a different approach for intervention, thereby reducing caregiver burden. Objective: As clustering of neuropsychiatric symptoms could be clinically relevant, we aimed to explore the effects of these clusters on burden in family dementia caregivers. Methods: 152 family dementia caregivers were included. Caregiver burden was measured using the Ervaren Druk door Informele Zorg (EDIZ)/Self-Perceived Pressure from Informal Care, a Dutch questionnaire. Caregivers also reported the neuropsychiatric symptoms and functional impairments in daily activities of the people with dementia they cared for. Multiple regression analyses were used in this cross-sectional study. Results: Adjusted for functional impairments and sociodemographic variables, neuropsychiatric symptoms were associated with more caregiver burden (p < 0.001). However, this association did not differ between the three neuropsychiatric symptom clusters (p = 0.745). Conclusions: Neuropsychiatric symptoms were associated with more family caregiver burden, but no conclusive evidence was found that this association differed for the three clusters. Clustering of neuropsychiatric symptoms is, however, worth exploring further in future studies with more participants. If specific links are found, these could be targeted in clinical practice in order to prevent, reduce and/or postpone caregiver burden.
