36297228|t|Porphyromonas gingivalis Virulence Factors and Clinical Significance in Periodontal Disease and Coronary Artery Diseases
36297228|a|Porphyromonas gingivalis is a gram-negative, anaerobic bacterium that lives in the oral cavity. It is an integral part of the oral microbiome, which includes more than 500 types of bacteria. Under certain circumstances, as a consequence of virulence factors, it can become very destructive and proliferate to many cells in periodontal lesions. It is one of the causative agents present extremely often in dental plaque and is the main etiological factor in the development of periodontal disease. During various therapeutic procedures, P. gingivalis can enter the blood and disseminate through it to distant organs. This primarily refers to the influence of periodontal agents on the development of subacute endocarditis and can facilitate the development of coronary heart disease, atherosclerosis, and ischemic infarction. The action of P. gingivalis is facilitated by numerous factors of virulence and pathogenicity such as fimbriae, hemolysin, hemagglutinin, capsules, outer membrane vesicles, lipopolysaccharides, and gingipains. A special problem is the possibility of biofilm formation. P. gingivalis in a biofilm is 500 to 1000 times less sensitive to antimicrobial drugs than planktonic cells, which represents a significant problem in the treatment of infections caused by this pathogen.
