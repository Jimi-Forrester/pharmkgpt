34729624|t|Trends in opioid use following balloon kyphoplasty or vertebroplasty for the treatment of vertebral compression fractures.
34729624|a|This retrospective analysis of insurance claims evaluated real-world trends in prescription fills among patients treated with balloon kyphoplasty (N = 6,656) or vertebroplasty (N = 2,189) following diagnosis of vertebral compression fracture. Among those with evidence of opioid use, nearly half of patients discontinued or reduced prescription fills relative to pre-operative levels. INTRODUCTION: Vertebral compression fractures (VCF) are associated with debilitating pain, spinal misalignment, increased mortality, and increased healthcare-resource utilization in elderly patients. This study evaluated the effect of balloon kyphoplasty (BKP) or vertebroplasty (VP) on post-procedure opioid prescription fills and payer costs in patients with VCF. METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of a large, nationally representative insurance-claims database. Clinical characteristics, opioid prescription patterns, and payer costs for subjects who underwent either BKP or VP to treat VCF were evaluated beginning 6 months prior to surgery through 7-month follow-up that included a 30-day, postoperative medication washout. Patient demographics, changes in opioid utilization, and payer costs were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 8,845 patients met eligibility criteria (75.3% BKP and 24.7% VP) with a mean of age 77 and 74% female. Among the 75% of patients who used opioids, 48.7% of patients discontinued opioid medication and 8.4% reduced prescription fills versus preoperative baseline. Patients who reduced or discontinued prescriptions exhibited a decrease in all-cause payer costs relative to pre-intervention levels, which was a significantly greater change relative to patients with no change, increase, or new start of opioids. CONCLUSIONS: Interventional treatment for VCF was associated with decreased or discontinued opioid prescription fills and reduced payer costs in follow-up in a significant proportion of the study population. Reduction of opioid-based harms may represent a previously unrecognized benefit of vertebral augmentation for VCF, especially in this elderly and medically fragile population.
