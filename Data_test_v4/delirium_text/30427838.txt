30427838|a|This study aimed to investigate the feasibility and clinical applicability of Diffusion Spectrum Imaging (DSI) for quantitative detection of white matter microstructural integrity. Twenty-seven patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM; aged 60.6+-7.6 years) and 21 healthy controls (HC; aged 56.1+-7.8 years) underwent high-resolution T1-weighted imaging and DSI scanning. Cognitive function scores were obtained using such instruments as the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). The fasting blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin, and total cholesterol (CHO) of T2DM were measured. The bilateral uncinate fasciculus and superior cingulum bundle were reconstructed by DSI tractography. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 21.0 software and P<0.05 was considered significant. Generalized fractional anisotropy (GFA) values were significantly decreased in the left uncinate fasciculus (t = -2.915, p = 0.005) and right superior cingulum bundle (t = -2.604, p = 0.012) in T2DM patients compared with the healthy controls (p<0.05). The MoCA (t = -3.339, p = 0.002) and CDT (t = -3.039, p = 0.004) scores of T2DM were significantly lower than those of healthy controls. Meanwhile, the GFA value of the right superior cingulum bundle was negatively associated with VFT score (r = -0.475, p = 0.012), and that of the right superior cingulum bundle was negatively associated with blood CHO level (r = -0.458, p = 0.016). DSI tractography is capable of evaluating the microstructural integrity of the white matter bundle in T2DM and is related to clinical cognitive scores and related biochemical indices; therefore, it can help to predict early white matter abnormalities in T2DM.
