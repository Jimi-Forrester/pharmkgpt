37310582|t|Hepatic Encephalopathy in Children.
37310582|a|Hepatic encephalopathy, characterized by mental status changes and neuropsychiatric impairment, is associated with chronic liver disease as well as acute liver failure. In children, its clinical manifestations can be challenging to pinpoint. However, careful assessment for the development of hepatic encephalopathy is imperative when caring for these patients as progression of symptoms can indicate impending cerebral edema and systemic deterioration. Hepatic encephalopathy can present with hyperammonemia, but it is important to note that the degree of hyperammonemia is not indicative of severity of clinical manifestations. Newer forms of assessment are undergoing further research, and include imaging, EEG and neurobiomarkers. Mainstay of treatment currently includes management of underlying cause of liver disease, as well as reduction of hyperammonemia with either enteral medications such as lactulose and rifaximin, or even with extracorporeal liver support modalities.
