7220682|t|[Several epidemiologic aspects of delirium tremens].
7220682|a|In a study carried out in 413 alcohol patients, 135 case histories of male delirium patients were evaluated according to clinical-statistical factors. Of importance is the high rate of complications showing 35.9 per cent of delirium patients and a considerable recidivation rate with a remarkable share of second and third deliria. This indicates an excessive alcohol abuse in our service area over many years and makes it possible to draw conclusions with respect to an improvement of prevention, clinical treatment and after-care of the delirium patients.
