37936084|a|BACKGROUND: Microbiota-gut-brain axis interacts with one another to regulate brain functions. However, whether the impacts of gut dysbiosis on limbic white matter (WM) tracts contribute to the neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) in patients with amyloid-positive amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI+), have not been explored yet. This study aimed to investigate the mediation effects of limbic WM integrity on the association between gut microbiota and NPS in patients with aMCI+. METHODS: Twenty patients with aMCI + and 20 healthy controls (HCs) were enrolled. All subjects underwent neuropsychological assessments and their microbial compositions were characterized using 16S rRNA Miseq sequencing technique. Amyloid deposition inspected by positron emission tomography imaging and limbic WM tracts (i.e., fornix, cingulum, and uncinate fasciculus) detected by diffusion tensor imaging were additionally measured in patients with aMCI+. We employed a regression-based mediation analysis using Hayes's PROCESS macro in this study. RESULTS: The relative abundance of genera Ruminococcus and Lactococcus was significantly decreased in patients with aMCI + versus HCs. The relative abundance of Ruminococcus was negatively correlated with affective symptom cluster in the aMCI + group. Notably, this association was mediated by WM integrity of the left cingulate gyrus. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest Ruminococcus as a potential target for the management of affective impairments in patients with aMCI+.
