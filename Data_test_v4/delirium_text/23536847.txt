23536847|t|Cu(2+) affects amyloid-beta (1-42) aggregation by increasing peptide-peptide binding forces.
23536847|a|The link between metals, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its implicated protein, amyloid-beta (Abeta), is complex and highly studied. AD is believed to occur as a result of the misfolding and aggregation of Abeta. The dyshomeostasis of metal ions and their propensity to interact with Abeta has also been implicated in AD. In this work, we use single molecule atomic force spectroscopy to measure the rupture force required to dissociate two Abeta (1-42) peptides in the presence of copper ions, Cu(2+). In addition, we use atomic force microscopy to resolve the aggregation of Abeta formed. Previous research has shown that metal ions decrease the lag time associated with Abeta aggregation. We show that with the addition of copper ions the unbinding force increases notably. This suggests that the reduction of lag time associated with Abeta aggregation occurs on a single molecule level as a result of an increase in binding forces during the very initial interactions between two Abeta peptides. We attribute these results to copper ions acting as a bridge between the two peptide molecules, increasing the stability of the peptide-peptide complex.
