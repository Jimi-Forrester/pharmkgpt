34940364|t|Alzheimer's Disease: Current Perspectives and Advances in Physiological Modeling.
34940364|a|Though Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, complete disease-modifying treatments are yet to be fully attained. Until recently, transgenic mice constituted most in vitro model systems of AD used for preclinical drug screening; however, these models have so far failed to adequately replicate the disease's pathophysiology. However, the generation of humanized APOE4 mouse models has led to key discoveries. Recent advances in stem cell differentiation techniques and the development of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have facilitated the development of novel in vitro devices. These "microphysiological" systems-in vitro human cell culture systems designed to replicate in vivo physiology-employ varying levels of biomimicry and engineering control. Spheroid-based organoids, 3D cell culture systems, and microfluidic devices or a combination of these have the potential to replicate AD pathophysiology and pathogenesis in vitro and thus serve as both tools for testing therapeutics and models for experimental manipulation.
