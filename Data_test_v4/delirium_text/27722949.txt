27722949|t|Non-reproductive triggers of postpartum psychosis.
27722949|a|Bipolar disorders, and other psychoses, are known to be triggered by a number of agents apart from the reproductive process. In some women, pregnant or recently delivered, psychosis may be due to these alternative triggers. There are substantial numbers of mothers suffering from childbearing psychoses, who have been prescribed bromocriptine or steroids, have had surgical operations or developed thyrotoxicosis. It is best to eliminate these episodes and cases from study samples of puerperal psychosis.
