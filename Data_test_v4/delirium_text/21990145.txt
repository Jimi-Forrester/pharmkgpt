21990145|t|Deciphering the role of nuclear factor-kappaB in cellular senescence.
21990145|a|Cellular senescence is a program of irreversible cell cycle arrest that cells undergo in response to a variety of intrinsic and extrinsic stimuli including progressive shortening of telomeres, changes in telomeric structure or other forms of genotoxic and non-genotoxic stress. The role of nuclear factor-kappaB in cellular senescence is controversial, as it has been associated with both proliferation and tumour progression, and also with growth arrest and ageing. This research perspective focuses on the evidence for a functional relationship between NF-kappaB and senescence, and how disruption of the NF-kappaB pathway can lead to its bypass.
