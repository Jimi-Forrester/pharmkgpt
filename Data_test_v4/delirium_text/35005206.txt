35005206|a|The Worldwide Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (WW-ADNI) is a collaborative effort to investigate imaging and biofluid markers that can inform Alzheimer's disease treatment trials. It is a public-private partnership that spans North America, Argentina, Australia, Canada, China, Japan, Korea, Mexico, and Taiwan. In 2004, ADNI researchers began a naturalistic, longitudinal study that continues today around the globe. Through several successive phases (ADNI-1, ADNI-GO, ADNI-2, and ADNI-3), the study has fueled amyloid and tau phenotyping and refined neuroimaging methodologies. WW-ADNI researchers have successfully standardized analyses and openly share data without embargo, providing a rich data set for other investigators. On August 26, 2020, the Alzheimer's Association convened WW-ADNI researchers who shared updates from ADNI-3 and their vision for ADNI-4.
