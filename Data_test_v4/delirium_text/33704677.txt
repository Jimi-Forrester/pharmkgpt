33704677|t|Verapamil Prevents Development of Cognitive Impairment in an Aged Mouse Model of Sporadic Alzheimer's Disease.
33704677|a|Currently, dementia is the only leading cause of death that is still on the rise, with total costs already exceeding those of cancer and heart disease and projected to increase even further in the coming years. Unfortunately, there are no satisfactory treatments and attempts to develop novel, more effective treatments have been extremely costly, albeit unsuccessful thus far. This has led us to investigate the use of established drugs, licensed for other therapeutic indications, for their potential application in cognitive disorders. This strategy, referred to as "drug repositioning," has been successful in many other areas including cancer and cardiovascular diseases. To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the effects of long-term treatment with verapamil, a calcium channel blocker commonly prescribed for various cardiovascular conditions and recently applied for prevention of cluster headaches, on the development of cognitive impairment in aged animals. Verapamil was studied at a low dose (1mg/kg/d) in a mouse model of sporadic Alzheimer's disease (sAD). Oral treatment with verapamil or vehicle was started, 24 h post-intracerebroventricular (ICV) streptozotocin/(STZ), in 12-month-old animals and continued for 3 months. Cognitive function was assessed using established tests for spatial learning, short-term/working memory, and long-term/reference memory. Our findings demonstrate that long-term low-dose verapamil effectively prevents development of ICV/STZ-induced cognitive impairment. It mitigates the astrogliosis and synaptic toxicity otherwise induced by ICV/STZ in the hippocampus of aged animals. These findings indicate that long-term, low-dose verapamil may delay progression of sAD in susceptible subjects of advanced age.
