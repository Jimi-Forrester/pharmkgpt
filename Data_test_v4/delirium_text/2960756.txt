2960756|t|A predictive test for Huntington's disease: recombinant DNA technology and implications for nursing.
2960756|a|A genetic marker for Huntington's disease has been located through the use of new recombinant deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) technology. As a result, researchers can now identify presymptomatic individuals who will develop this disease. Recently, the same approach used to locate the Huntington's disease marker led to the discovery of gene markers for Alzheimer's disease and manic-depressive illness. It is likely that clinical tests for this and other neurogenetic diseases will soon become available. The ability to perform presymptomatic and prenatal testing on individuals at risk for genetic diseases raises difficult ethical, social, and psychological issues. It is imperative that nurses understand the technology involved and be prepared to help clients cope with the profound effects genetic testing will have on their lives. Using the example of the discovery of the genetic marker for Huntington's disease, this article examines one aspect of current recombinant DNA technology, discusses the major issues raised by the availability of a predictive test, and looks at implications for nursing care.
