36601217|t|Relationships Between Resting Energy Expenditure and Transcranial Doppler Measurements in Patients With and Without Brain Death.
36601217|a|Introduction Brain metabolism deteriorates during brain death, suggesting that cerebral metabolic measurements could serve as a prognostic factor. The application of transcranial Doppler can be useful in evaluating patients evolving to brain death. Resting energy expenditure is lower than expected in patients with brain death, and this is caused by the decrease in cerebral blood flow and consequently lower oxygen supply. The primary aim of this retrospective study is to investigate the early metabolic changes in patients with clinical criteria of brain death and examine if these changes are related to a gradual decrease in blood flow velocities in the middle cerebral artery. Methods All consecutive patients from 1st June 2018 to 30th April 2022, admitted to the ICU with brain injury and a GCS <= 8, were included retrospectively in the study. Patients were allocated into two groups: Group A, patients without clinical signs of brain death (n = 32), and Group B, patients with brain death (n = 34). In each group, three sets of metabolic measurements were performed concomitantly with cerebral blood flow velocities using transcranial Doppler (a) upon admission to the ICU, (b) once hemodynamic stabilization was obtained, and (c) 48 hours after their hemodynamic stabilization or when brain death was confirmed by clinical criteria. Resting energy expenditure (REE) measurements were performed using a metabolic computer. Cerebral blood flow velocities were measured after a period of 30 min using a 2-MHZ 2D ultrasound probe. Results Brain-dead patients had a significant decrease in their metabolic parameters as the cerebral blood flow velocities recorded with the transcranial Doppler deteriorated, (REE Group A = 1667.65 +- 597 vs Group B = 1376.12 +- 615, p = 0.05 and REE predicted Group A = 113.19 +- 44.9 vs Group B = 93.29 +- 41.5, p = 0.066 for measurement 1; REE Group A = 1844 +- 530.9 vs Group B = 1219.97 +- 489, p < 0.001 and REE predicted Group A = 124.38 +- 39 vs Group B = 81.35 +- 30.4, p < 0.001 for measurement 2; REE Group A = 1750.97 +- 414, p < 0.001 and REE predicted Group A = 116.38 +- 19.2 vs Group B = 56.09 +- 19.6, p < 0.001 for measurement 3). Multiple stepwise regression analysis revealed a strong relationship between age, the worsening of the blood flow velocities pattern, and the decrease in REE (multiple R = 0.264, F = 5.55, p = 0.009). Furthermore, a statistically significant correlation was found between temperature and REE (correlation coefficient = 0.500, 0.674, 0.784 for measurements 1, 2, and 3, respectively, and p < 0.001 for all measures). Conclusions In brain-dead patients, the gradual decrease in cerebral blood flow leads to a decrease in REE as well as thermogenetic control. These changes can be detected early after the patient's admission to the ICU.
