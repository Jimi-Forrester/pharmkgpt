22840285|a|OBJECTIVE: Malignancy-related thromboembolism, also referred to as Trousseau's syndrome, can present as acute cerebral infarction, nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis (NBTE), and migratory thrombophlebitis. Therefore, many physical, neurological, and psychological symptoms associated with Trousseau's syndrome may occur in the clinical course. METHOD: To illustrate this, we report a case of a male patient in his 50s with carcinomatous peritonitis caused by gastric cancer, with multiple cerebral infractions that developed during disease progression. The patient was admitted to our hospital for the treatment of side effects of chemotherapy, although he strongly hoped to go home as soon as possible. In addition to making social supports plans, we were required to perform intensive total palliative care, because of his physical pain, general fatigue, anorexia, abdominal and neck pain, and psychological issues (insomnia, delirium, depression, suicidal thoughts, self-mutilation, panic attacks, agoraphobia, fear of death, and feelings of hopelessness). RESULTS: To the best of our knowledge, based on the literature search, this is the first reported case of Trousseau's syndrome described in the context of total palliative care, especially psychological care. SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: We propose that neurological symptoms of Trousseau's syndrome cause these extensive mental disorders. Furthermore, because of the prognosis of Trousseau's syndrome, we should utilize our expertise fulfill the patient's wishes.
