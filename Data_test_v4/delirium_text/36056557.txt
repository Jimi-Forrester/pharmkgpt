36056557|a|Sirtuin 3 (SIRT3), the main family member of mitochondrial deacetylase, targets the majority of substrates controlling mitochondrial biogenesis via lysine deacetylation and modulates important cellular functions such as energy metabolism, reactive oxygen species production and clearance, oxidative stress, and aging. Deletion of SIRT3 has a deleterious effect on mitochondrial biogenesis, thus leading to the defect in mitochondrial function and insufficient ATP production. Imbalance of mitochondrial dynamics leads to excessive mitochondrial biogenesis, dampening mitochondrial function. Mitochondrial dysfunction plays an important role in several diseases related to aging, such as cardiovascular disease, cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC1alpha) launches mitochondrial biogenesis through activating nuclear respiratory factors. These factors act on genes, transcribing and translating mitochondrial DNA to generate new mitochondria. PGC1alpha builds a bridge between SIRT3 and mitochondrial biogenesis. This review described the involvement of SIRT3 and mitochondrial dynamics, particularly mitochondrial biogenesis in aging-related diseases, and further illustrated the role of the signaling events between SIRT3 and mitochondrial biogenesis in the pathological process of aging-related diseases.
