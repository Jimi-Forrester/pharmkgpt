38063740|t|Cytotoxicity of PEG-Coated Gold and Gold-Iron Alloy Nanoparticles: ROS or Ferroptosis?
38063740|a|Nanomedicine relies on the exploitation of nanoscale constructs for therapeutic and diagnostic functions. Gold and gold-iron alloy nanoparticles (NPs) are two examples of nanomaterials with favorable features for use in nanomedicine. While gold NPs have been studied extensively in the last decades, they are not biodegradable. Nonetheless, biodegradation was recently observed in gold alloys with iron obtained using laser ablation in liquid (LAL). Hence, there is a significant interest in the study of the biological effects of gold and gold-iron alloy nanoparticles, starting from their tolerability and cytotoxicity. In this study, these two classes of NPs, obtained via LAL and coated with biocompatible polymers such as polyethylene glycol, were investigated in terms of their cytotoxicity in fibroblasts, prostate cancer cells (PC3) and embryonic kidney cells (HEK). We also explored the effects of different synthetic procedures, stabilizing additives, and the possible mechanisms behind cell mortality such as the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) or ferroptosis. NPs larger than 200 nm were associated with lower cell tolerability. The most tolerable formulations were pure PEG-Au NPs, followed by PEG-Au-Fe NPs with a hydrodynamic size < 50 nm, which displayed a toxicity of only 20% in fibroblasts after 72 h of incubation. In addition, tumor cells and highly proliferating HEK cells are more sensitive to the NPs than fibroblasts. However, a protective effect of catalase was found for cells incubated with PEG-Au-Fe NPs, indicating an important role of hydrogen peroxide in alloy NP interactions with cells. These results are crucial for directing future synthetic efforts for the realization of biocompatible Au NPs and biodegradable and cytocompatible Au-Fe alloy NPs. Moreover, the correlation of the cytocompatibility of NPs with ROS and ferroptosis in cells is of general interest and applicability to other types of nanomaterials.
