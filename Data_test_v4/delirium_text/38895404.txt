38895404|t|gamma-secretase facilitates retromer-mediated retrograde transport.
38895404|a|The retromer complex mediates retrograde transport of protein cargos from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network (TGN). gamma-secretase is a multisubunit protease that cleaves the transmembrane domain of its target proteins. Mutations in genes encoding subunits of retromer or gamma-secretase can cause familial Alzheimer disease (AD) and other degenerative neurological diseases. It has been reported that retromer interacts with gamma-secretase, but the consequences of this interaction are not known. Here, we report that retromer-mediated retrograde protein trafficking in cultured human epithelial cells is impaired by inhibition of gamma-secretase activity or by genetic elimination of gamma-secretase. gamma-secretase inhibitor XXI and knockout of PS1, the catalytic subunit of gamma-secretase, inhibit endosome to TGN trafficking of retromer-dependent retrograde cargos, divalent metal transporter 1 isoform II (DMT1-II), cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (CIMPR), and shiga toxin. Trafficking of retromer-independent cargos, such as cholera toxin and a CIMPR mutant that does not bind to retromer was not affected by gamma-secretase inhibition. XXI treatment and PS1 KO inhibit interaction of gamma-secretase with retromer but do not inhibit the association of cargo with retromer or with gamma-secretase in intact cells. Similarly, these treatments do not affect the level of Rab7-GTP, which regulates retromer-cargo interaction. These results suggest that the gamma-secretase-retromer interaction facilitates retromer-mediated retrograde trafficking.
