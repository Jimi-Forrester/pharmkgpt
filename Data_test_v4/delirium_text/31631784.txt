31631784|t|Spousal Dementia Caregiving to Widowhood: Perceptions of Older Urban and Rural Widows.
31631784|a|Older widows might experience poor health outcomes following their spousal dementia caregiving experience. Widows from rural areas with fewer resources may have worse health outcomes. Serial, qualitative interviews were conducted at baseline, 6-months and 12-months with 13 urban and nine rural older widows who cared for husbands with dementia. Perceptions of caregiving, widowhood, and resources were examined. Major themes were 24/7 Care, Watch the Man Go Down, Build a Network, Spiritual Support, No Regrets/Some Regrets, Time for Me Now, Loneliness, and Keep Reaching In. Compared to urban widows, rural widows had fewer emotional and tangible resources. All widows desired more support during spousal dementia caregiving and in their transition to widowhood. Nurses need to continue to support the transition from spousal dementia caregiving to widowhood and to test interventions unique to meeting the needs of urban and rural older women.
