33033297|a|Although Hartmann's procedure (HP) is commonly used as emergency treatment for colorectal disease, the reversal of HP (HR) is infrequently performed. The aims were to evaluate the rate of HR and determine the factors predictive of achieving HR. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients who underwent HP between January 2007 and June 2019 at six Hallym University-affiliated hospitals. Multivariable analysis was performed to identify which factors were independently associated with HR. In the study period, 437 patients underwent HP, and 127 (29.0%) subsequently underwent HR. Of these, 46 (35.9%) patients experienced post-HR complications. In multivariable analysis, an interval between HP and HR of > 6 months was associated with the only lower rate of post-HR complications. Multivariate analysis showed that HR was less likely in patients aged > 70 years, those with American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class III or IV, elective surgery, those experiencing more than two HP-related complications, and those with a malignancy (an indication for HP). One-third of the patients underwent HR. Age > 70 years, ASA class III or IV, elective surgery, more than two HP-related complications, and malignancy were associated with a non-HR rate.
