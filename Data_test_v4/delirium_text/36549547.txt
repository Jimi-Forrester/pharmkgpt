36549547|a|BACKGROUND: Postoperative delirium is a common complication in elderly patients who have undergone hip fracture surgery. Since postoperative delirium is associated with poor outcomes and the treatment is very complicated, identifying the patients at high risk for delirium and providing more attentive care to prevent postoperative delirium is essential. In this study, we aimed to assess the association of an elevated C-reactive protein (CRP)/albumin ratio with the increased incidence of postoperative delirium in elderly people who had undergone hip fracture surgery. METHODS: A total of 629 patients who underwent hip fracture surgery between January 2014 and December 2018 were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were classified into two groups according to preoperative CRP/albumin cut-off levels (<1.5 and >=1.5). We performed a propensity score matching analysis to compare the incidence of postoperative delirium and overall mortality between the two groups. Multivariate logistic regression and Cox regression analyses were performed to examine the association of the preoperative CRP/albumin ratio with postoperative delirium and overall mortality. RESULTS: There were significant differences in the incidence of postoperative delirium (18.0 % vs. 35.8 %, P < 0.001) and overall mortality (26.7 % vs. 46.9 %, P < 0.001) between the groups before matching. We also observed significant differences in the incidence of postoperative delirium (20.7 % vs. 32.7 %, P = 0.019) and overall mortality (34.7 % vs. 46.0 %, P = 0.046) between the groups after matching. A high CRP/albumin ratio (>=1.5) was significantly associated with a higher incidence of postoperative delirium (adjusted odds ratio [OR]: 2.11, 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1.40-3.18, P < 0.001) and a higher rate of overall mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [HR]: 1.44, 95 % CI: 1.07-1.93, P = 0.015). CONCLUSION: Preoperative CRP/albumin ratio might be an independent risk factor of postoperative delirium and surgical prognosis in elderly patients undergoing hip fracture surgery.
