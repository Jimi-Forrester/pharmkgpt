30366611|a|This study described experiences of caregivers of persons with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias (ADRD) and caregivers of persons with other chronic conditions on self-reported health, type of assistance they provide, perceptions of how caregiving interferes with their lives, and perceived level of support. A secondary analysis was conducted of the 2013 Porter Novelli SummerStyles survey data. Of the 4033 respondents, 650 adults self-identified as caregivers with 11.6% caring for people with ADRD. Over half of all caregivers reported that caregiving interfered with their lives to some extent. The greater the perceived support caregivers reported, the less they thought that caregiving interfered with their lives (p < .001). No significant differences were found between ADRD and non-ADRD caregivers regarding general health, types of assistance they provided, and perceived level of support. These findings have the potential to inform future research and practice in the development of supportive services for caregivers.
