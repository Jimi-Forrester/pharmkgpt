34695452|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disease which is characterized by amyloid beta (Abeta) accumulation. We found that glycoprotein NMB (GPNMB) was highly expressed in the brain of APP/PS1 mice, a mouse model of AD. However, its role in AD remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to explore the function of GPNMB in AD. The expression of GPNMB in the brain was detected by immunofluorescence and western blot. In addition, the role of GPNMB in AD was explored through gain-of-function. Autophagy, which is beneficial to Abeta clearance, was evaluated by transmission electron microscope and immunofluorescence with beclin-1. Furthermore, 3-MA, an autophagy inhibitor, was employed to evidence whether GPNMB reduced the level of Abeta through autophagy. We found that over-expression of GPNMB improved AD-like behaviors in APP/PS1 mice and reduced Abeta deposition. Further study showed that GPNMB enhanced autophagy, reduced microglial cells and inhibited the activation of the mTOR signal. Additionally, treatment with 3-MA abolished the beneficial effect of GPNMB on Abeta clearance. This study revealed that the high level of GPNMB in AD brain may help Abeta clearance and improve AD-like behaviors through enhancing autophagy via suppressing the mTOR signal. This beneficial role of GPNMB provides us novel strategies for the prevention and treatment of AD.
