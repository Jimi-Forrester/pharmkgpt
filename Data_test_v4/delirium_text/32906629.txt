32906629|a|Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) is the only form of dementia that can be cured by surgery. Its diagnosis relies on clinical and radiological criteria. Identifying patients who can benefit from surgery is challenging, as other neurological diseases can be concomitant or mimic iNPH. We performed a systematic review on the role of positron emission tomography (PET) in iNPH. We retrieved 35 papers evaluating four main functional aspects with different PET radiotracers: (1) PET with amyloid tracers, revealing Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology in 20-57% of suspected iNPH patients, could be useful in predictions of surgical outcome. (2) PET with radiolabeled water as perfusion tracer showed a global decreased cerebral blood flow (CBF) and regional reduction of CBF in basal ganglia in iNPH; preoperative perfusion parameters could predict surgical outcome. (3) PET with 2-Deoxy-2-[18F]fluoroglucose ([18F]FDG ) showed a global reduction of glucose metabolism without a specific cortical pattern and a hypometabolism in basal ganglia; [18F]FDG PET may identify a coexisting neurodegenerative disease, helping in patient selection for surgery; postsurgery increase in glucose metabolism was associated with clinical improvement. (4) Dopaminergic PET imaging showed a postsynaptic D2 receptor reduction and striatal upregulation of D2 receptor after treatment, associated with clinical improvement. Overall, PET imaging could be a useful tool in iNPH diagnoses and treatment response.
