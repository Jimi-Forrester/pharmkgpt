28493038|t|Perioperative implications of thoracic decortications: a retrospective cohort study.
28493038|a|PURPOSE: An increasing number of thoracic decortications have been performed in Manitoba, from five in 2007 to 45 in 2014. The primary objective of this study was to define the epidemiology of decortications in Manitoba. The secondary objective was to compare patients who underwent decortication due to primary infectious vs non-infectious etiology with respect to their perioperative outcomes. METHODS: Data for this cohort study were extracted from consecutive charts of all adult patients who underwent a decortication in Manitoba from 2007-2014 inclusive. RESULTS: One hundred ninety-two patients underwent a decortication. The most frequent disease processes resulting in a decortication were pneumonia (60%), trauma (13%), malignancy (8%), and procedural complications (5%). The number of decortications due to complications of pneumonia rose at the greatest rate, from three cases in 2007 to 29 cases in 2014. Performing a decortication for an infectious vs a non-infectious etiology was associated with a higher rate of the composite postoperative outcome of myocardial infarction, acute kidney injury, need of vasopressors for > 12 hr, and mechanical ventilation for > 48 hr (44.4% vs 24.2%, respectively; relative risk, 1.83; 95% confidence interval, 1.1 to 2.9; P = 0.01). CONCLUSION: There has been a ninefold increase in decortications over an eight-year period. Potential causes include an increase in the incidence of pneumonia, increased organism virulence, host changes, and changes in practice patterns. Patients undergoing decortication for infectious causes had an increased risk for adverse perioperative outcomes. Anesthesiologists need to be aware of the high perioperative morbidity of these patients and the potential need for postoperative admission to an intensive care unit.
