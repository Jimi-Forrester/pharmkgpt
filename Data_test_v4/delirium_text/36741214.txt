36741214|t|The Role of the Research Advanced Practice Provider in CAR T-Cell Clinical Trials.
36741214|a|In recent years, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has emerged as an effective and potentially paradigm-shifting therapy for patients with refractory lymphoma and myeloma. This novel therapy involves engineering T cells to recognize specific antigens on the surface of cancer cells. Several CAR T-cell products are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration as a result of numerous clinical trials. Due to the complexity of these studies and the high level of care required for CAR T-cell therapy patients, the role of the research advanced practice provider (APP) has become increasingly central to the success of CAR T-cell trials. This review article explores the vital role of the research APP in CAR T-cell clinical trials.
