39427134|a|BACKGROUND: Older adults account for a large proportion of hospital admissions. In this study we aim to bridge a gap between medical and psychosocial factors in predicting hospitalisation. METHODS: Demographic and social characteristics of community-dwelling pre-frail and frail older people were collected by questionnaires every six months during a two year follow-up. Hospital admission within this period was dichotomised as yes/no. To define pre-frailty and frailty the Fried frailty criteria were used. Analysis of risk factors for hospitalisation was performed using multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: Hospitalised participants (n = 1803) were more often male and frail in comparison to not-hospitalised participants. They also experienced more chronic diseases (54.5% >= 4 chronic diseases), poorer self-perceived health (SPH) (76.4% fair to very poor) and lack of informal care (20.1%). In multivariable logistic regression male gender (Odds ratio (OR) 1.65, p < 0.001), frailty (vs. pre-frailty) (OR 1.66, p = 0.002), reporting lower SPH (OR 3.12, p < 0.001) and lacking informal care (OR 1.69, p < 0.001) showed significant associations with hospital admission. Subgroup analysis of pre-frail and frail participants, showed consistent associations between male gender (respectively OR 1.61, p < 0.001 ; OR 1.72, p = 0.085), lower SPH (OR 2.23, p = 0.001; OR 31.16, p < 0.001), lack of informal care (OR 1.64, p = 0.005; OR 2.63, p = 0.012) and hospitalisation. CONCLUSION: Frailty, male gender, lower SPH and lack of informal care are risk factors for hospitalisation within community-dwelling older people, showing the need of a holistic approach to possibly prevent hospitalisation. Further research should focus on evaluating individual factors for hospitalisation, particularly targeting pre-frail individuals.
