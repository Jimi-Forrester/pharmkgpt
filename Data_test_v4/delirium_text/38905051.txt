38905051|a|Background: Citicoline is a naturally occurring compound with pleiotropic effects on neuronal function and cognitive processes. Objective: Based on previous studies, which shed light on the positive effects of citicoline 1 g when combined with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) and/or memantine, we further investigated the benefits of citicoline in combination therapy in Alzheimer's disease and mixed dementia. Methods: We integrated the datasets of CITIMEM and CITIDEMAGE, increasing the overall sample size to enhance statistical power. We analyzed data from these two investigator-initiated studies involving 295 patients. The primary outcome was the assessment over time of the effects of combined treatment versus memantine given alone or AChEI plus memantine on cognitive functions assessed by Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). The secondary outcomes were the influence of combined treatment on daily life functions, mood, and behavioral symptoms assessed by activities of daily life (ADL) and instrumental ADL, Geriatric Depression Scale, and Neuropsychiatric Inventory Scale. One-hundred-forty-three patients were treated with memantine and/or AChEI (control group), and 152 patients were treated with memantine and/or AChEI plus citicoline 1 g/day orally (Citicoline group). Results: A significant difference in MMSE score was found in the average between the two groups of treatment at 6 and 12 months. Conclusions: This study confirmed the effectiveness of combined citicoline treatment in patients with mixed dementia and Alzheimer's disease, with a significant effect on the increase of MMSE score over time. The treated group also showed a significant reduction in the Geriatric Depression Scale and a significant increase in the instrumental ADL scale.
