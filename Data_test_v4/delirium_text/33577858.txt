33577858|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia and is set to rise in prevalence as the global trends in population aging. The extracellular deposition of amyloid protein (Abeta) and the intracellular formation of neurofibrillary tangles in the brain have been recognized as the two core pathologies of AD. Over the past decades, the presence of neuroinflammation in the brain has been documented as the third core pathology of AD. In recent years, emerging evidence demonstrated that the purinergic receptor P2X7 (P2X7R) serves a critical role in microglia responses and neuroinflammation. Besides, targeting P2X7R by genetic or pharmacological strategies attenuates the symptoms and pathological changes of AD models, and P2X7R has been recognized as a promising therapeutic target for AD. In this review, we summarized the recent evidence concerning the roles of P2X7R in neuroinflammation and implications in AD pathogenesis.
