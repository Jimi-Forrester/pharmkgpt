16079045|t|Psychiatric manifestations of autoimmune disorders.
16079045|a|Psychiatric symptoms are common to many autoimmune disorders. Patients often will have mood disorders, anxiety, cognitive deficits, delirium, and psychosis. These symptoms may reflect the direct or indirect effect of the autoimmune disorder on the central nervous system, may be related to medications used to treat the disorder, or may be a direct psychologic impact from suffering with the autoimmune disorder. Accurately recognizing the psychiatric component and generating a differential diagnosis is a complex task for the treating physician. Treatment of the psychiatric component to the disorder often will include addressing steroid induced side effects, psychotropic medications, psychotherapy, patient and family education, and a strong physician-patient relationship.
