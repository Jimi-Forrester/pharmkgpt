However, four drugs, namely donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine and memantine, have been licensed for treating the symptoms of the disease. AIM: To systematically review the efficacy and side-effects of these drugs. METHOD: With the help of Pubmed, Medline and the Cochrane Library the literature was searched systematically. RESULTS: Cholinesterase-inhibitors and memantine do have a beneficial effect on cognition and daily functioning. The effect, however, is limited and the cholinesterase-inhibitors in particular frequently have side-effects. CONCLUSION: Treatment with the new anti-Alzheimer drugs demands a careful and realistic approach. The drugs should not be prescribed in isolation but the treatment needs to be embedded in the entire set of currently available psychosocial intervention techniques.
