30294583|t|Emotional and Psychological Needs of People with Diabetes.
30294583|a|Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disorder that impacts physical, social and mental including psychological well-being of people living with it. Additionally, psychosocial problems that are most common in diabetes patients often result in serious negative impact on patient's well-being and social life, if left un-addressed. Addressing such psychosocial aspects including cognitive, emotional, behavioral and social factors in the treatment interventions would help overcome the psychological barriers, associated with adherence and self-care for diabetes; the latter being the ultimate goal of management of patients with diabetes. While ample literature on self-management and psychological interventions for diabetes is available, there is limited information on the impact of psychological response and unmanaged emotional distresses on overall health. The current review therefore examines the emotional, psychological needs of the patients with diabetes and emphasizes the role of diabetologist, mental health professionals including clinical psychologists to mitigate the problems faced by these patients. Search was performed using a combination of keywords that cover all relevant terminology for diabetes and associated emotional distress. The psychological reactions experienced by the patient upon diagnosis of diabetes have been reviewed in this article with a focus on typical emotional distress at different levels. Identifying and supporting patients with psychosocial problems early in the course of diabetes may promote psychosocial well-being and improve their ability to adjust or take adequate responsibility in diabetes self-management - the utopian state dreamt of by all diabetologists !.
