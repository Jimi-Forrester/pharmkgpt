38969876|t|Guideline "Parkinson's disease" of the German Society of Neurology (Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Neurologie): concepts of care.
38969876|a|INTRODUCTION: In 2023, the German Society of Neurology published a new guideline on Parkinson's disease. An important section dealt with PD care concepts, which represent a particularly dynamic field of PD research, including their implementation in clinical practice. Parkinson's disease is the second most common age-associated neurodegenerative disease. Current estimates of the number of cases in the population describe a significant increase in prevalence in Germany by 2030 with higher proportions in rural areas, which also have a lack of sufficient PD care resources. RECOMMENDATIONS: In comparison with other international guidelines, which have so far mentioned palliative care and Parkinson's nurses in particular, the German S2k guideline expands the recommended concepts of PD care to include PD day clinics, inpatient complex treatment, and PD networks. CONCLUSION: Concepts of PD care guidelines are necessary because of the complex and rapidly evolving field of PD care provision. If applied appropriately, the potential for optimized care can be exploited and both the patient burden and the economic burden can be reduced. Given that modern care concepts have so far only been applied in a few regions, it is often impossible to generate broad evidence-based data, so that the evaluation of PD care concepts is partly dependent on expert opinion.
