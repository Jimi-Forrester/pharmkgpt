36593834|a|Alzheimer's disease is ranked among the top five causes of death for old people. Globally, it is approximated that there are 7.7 million new cases of Alzheimer's disease per annum and it is expected that by the year 2050, as many as 1.5% of people will be victims of Alzheimers or other types of dementia. Currently there is no cure for Alzheimer's disease and the conventional therapeutics agents available either have low efficacy or are associated with serious side effects. In the current study, in vivo cognitive advancing and anticholinesterase effects of crude methanol extracts of stem bark and leaf of Prunus africana were investigated in scopolamine treated mice. Passive avoidance task was used to evaluate cognitive enhancing effects of the two plant extracts. Donepezil was used as the standard drug. Scopolamine butylbromide (5 mg/kg bw) was administered intraperitoneally to induce Alzheimer's disease in mice during the study. A completely controlled randomised experimental design was employed in the current study. The two extracts displayed significant anticholinesterase activities and improved cognition in a dose dependent fashion as indicated by escape latency trends. From the current study, it is concluded that methanol extracts of stem bark and leaf of P. africana contain phytochemicals with anticholinesterase activity and cognitive enhancing effects in scopolamine treated mice. The study therefore supports use of leaf and stem bark extracts of P. africana for management of dementia by traditional herbal practitioners.
