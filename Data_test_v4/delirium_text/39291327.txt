39291327|a|Amputation as a life-saving measure for earthquake-trapped patients is supported by WHO and INSARAG guidelines. However, implementing these guidelines in highly stressful contexts can complicate decision-making. This report presents a case of life-saving amputation during the 2023 Turkey earthquake, adhering to recommended guidelines. The 16-year-old patient was trapped for 55 hours in a narrow corridor. Extensive interdisciplinary discussions led to the decision for a field amputation after alternative rescue attempts failed. Consent was obtained from the family, given the patient's delirium. Meticulous planning and anesthesia using midazolam and ketamine ensured successful amputation with minimal blood loss. Challenges encountered during the disaster response were discussed. Delays in administering antibiotics, a lack of cervical protection, ethical dilemmas, psychological concerns, and legal implications were highlighted. Continued improvement and addressing ethical, legal, and psychological aspects are essential for optimal disaster response outcomes.
