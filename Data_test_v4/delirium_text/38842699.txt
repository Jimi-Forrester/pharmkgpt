38842699|a|RATIONALE: Alzheimer's disease (AD), an age-dependent devastating neuropsychiatric disorder, is a leading cause of learning, memory and intellectual disabilities. Current therapeutic approaches for the amelioration of the anomalies of AD are not effective. OBJECTIVE: In the present study, the molecular mechanisms underlying sporadic AD (sAD), the memory related behavioral analysis and neuroprotective effects of Ellagic acid (EA) were investigated. METHOD: sAD mouse model was developed by intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of Streptozotocin (STZ). The efficacy of EA, a naturally occurring polyphenol, in amelioration of anomalies associated with sAD was assessed. EA was administered once daily for 28 days at a dose of 75 mg/kg body weight followed by neurobehavioral, biochemical, molecular and neuronal count analysis to delineate the mode of action of EA. RESULT: The ICV injection of STZ in mice significantly increased the expression of AD biomarkers in addition to enhanced oxidative stress. A decline in the discrimination index in Novel Object Recognition Test was observed indicating the compromise of recognition memory in AD. Studies on the expression of genes involved in synaptic plasticity reveal the dysregulation of the alpha-Amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR) of the glutamate and its scaffolding proteins in the postsynaptic density and thereby synaptic plasticity in AD. ICV-STZ led to significant upregulation of apoptotic markers which led to decrease in neuronal density of the cerebral cortex. EA significantly reversed the above and improved anomalies of sAD. CONCLUSION: EA was observed to profoundly modulate the genes involved in AD pathophysiology, restored antioxidant enzymes activity, reduced lipid peroxidation and neuronal loss in the sAD brain. Further, EA was observed to effectively modulate the genes involved in apoptosis and synaptic plasticity. Therefore, EA possesses promising anti-AD properties, which may improve AD-associated anomalies by modulating synaptic plasticity via AMPAR signaling.
