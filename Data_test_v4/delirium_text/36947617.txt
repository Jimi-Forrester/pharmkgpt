36947617|a|The transition from a disordered to an assembly-competent monomeric state (N*) in amyloidogenic sequences is a crucial event in the aggregation cascade. Using a well-calibrated model for intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), we show that the N* states, which bear considerable resemblance to the polymorphic fibril structures found in experiments, not only appear as excitations in the free energy landscapes of Abeta40 and Abeta42, but also initiate the aggregation cascade. For Abeta42, the transitions to the different N* states are in accord with Ostwald's rule of stages, with the least stable structures forming ahead of thermodynamically favored ones. The Abeta40 and Abeta42 monomer landscapes exhibit different extents of local frustration, which we show have profound implications in dictating subsequent self-assembly. Using kinetic transition networks, we illustrate that the most favored dimerization routes proceed via N* states. We argue that Ostwald's rule also holds for the aggregation of fused in sarcoma and polyglutamine proteins.
