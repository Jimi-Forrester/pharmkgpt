33920973|a|As the incidence of Chronic Non-Communicable Diseases (CNCDs) increases, preventive approaches become more crucial. In this review, calorie restriction (CR) effects on human beings were evaluated, comparing the benefits and risks of different CR diets: classic CR vs. ketosis-inducing diets, including intermittent fasting (IF), classic ketogenic diet (CKD), fasting mimicking diet (FMD), very-low-calorie ketogenic Diet (VLCKD) and Spanish ketogenic Mediterranean diet (SKMD). Special emphasis on insulin resistance (IR) was placed, as it mediates metabolic syndrome (MS), a known risk factor for CNCD, and is predictive of MS diagnosis. CR is the most robust intervention known to increase lifespan and health span, with high evidence and known biochemical mechanisms. CR improves cardiometabolic risk parameters, boosts exercise insulin sensitivity response, and there may be benefits of implementing moderate CR on healthy young and middle-aged individuals. However, there is insufficient evidence to support long-term CR. CKD is effective for weight and MS management, and may have additional benefits such as prevention of muscle loss and appetite control. SKMD has extreme significance benefits for all the metabolic parameters studied. Studies show inconsistent benefits of IF compared to classic CR. More studies are required to study biochemical parameters, reinforce evidence, identify risks, and seek effective and safe nutritional CR approaches.
