23426334|a|OBJECTIVE: To comprehensively assess pre-, intra-, and postoperative delirium risk factors as potential targets for intervention. BACKGROUND: Delirium after cardiac surgery is associated with longer intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and poorer functional and cognitive outcomes. Reports on delirium risk factors so far did not cover the full range of patients' presurgical conditions, intraoperative factors, and postoperative course. METHODS: After written informed consent, 221 consecutive patients >= 50 years scheduled for cardiac surgery were assessed for preoperative cognitive performance, and functional and physical status. Clinical and biochemical data were systematically recorded perioperatively. RESULTS: Of the 215 patients remaining for analysis, 31% developed delirium in the intensive care unit. Using logistic regression models, older age [73.3 (71.2-75.4) vs 68.5 (67.0-70.0); P = 0.016], higher Charlson's comorbidity index [3.0 (1.5-4.0) vs 2.0 (1.0-3.0) points; P = 0.009], lower Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score (MMSE, [27 (23-29) vs 28 (27-30) points; P = 0.021], length of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) [CPB; 133 (112-163) vs 119 (99-143) min; P = 0.004], and systemic inflammatory response syndrome in the intensive care unit [25 (36.2%) vs 13 (8.9%); P = 0.001] were independently associated with delirium. Combining age, MMSE score, Charlson's comorbidity index, and length of CPB in a regression equation allowed for a prediction of postoperative delirium with a sensitivity of 71.19% and a specificity of 76.26% (receiver operating analysis, area under the curve: 0.791; 95% confidence interval: 0.727-0.845). CONCLUSIONS: Further research will evaluate if modification of these risk factors prevents delirium and improves outcomes.
