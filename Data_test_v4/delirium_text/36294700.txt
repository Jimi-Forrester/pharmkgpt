36294700|a|SRX246, an orally available CNS penetrant vasopressin (VP) V1a receptor antagonist, was studied in Huntington's disease (HD) patients with irritability and aggressive behavior in the exploratory phase 2 trial, Safety, Tolerability, and Activity of SRX246 in Irritable HD patients (STAIR). This was a dose-escalation study; subjects received final doses of 120 mg BID, 160 mg BID, or placebo. The compound was safe and well tolerated. In this paper, we summarize the results of exploratory analyses of measures of problematic behaviors, including the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI), Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC), Problem Behaviors Assessment-short form (PBA-s), Irritability Scale (IS), Clinical Global Impression (CGI), HD Quality of Life (QoL), and Caregiver Burden questionnaires. In addition to these, we asked subjects and caregivers to record answers to short questions about mood, irritability, and aggressive conduct in an eDiary. STAIR was the first rigorously designed study of behavioral endpoints like these in HD. The exploratory analyses showed that SRX246 reduced aggressive acts. Readily observed behaviors should be used as trial endpoints.
