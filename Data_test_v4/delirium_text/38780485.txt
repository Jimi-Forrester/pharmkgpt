38780485|a|For many years, it has been hypothesized that pathological changes to the gut microbiome in critical illness is a driver of infections, organ dysfunction, and other adverse outcomes in the intensive care unit (ICU). The advent of contemporary microbiome methodologies and multi-omics tools have allowed researchers to test this hypothesis by dissecting host-microbe interactions in the gut to better define its contribution to critical illness pathogenesis. Observational studies of patients in ICUs have revealed that gut microbial communities are profoundly altered in critical illness, characterized by markedly reduced alpha diversity, loss of commensal taxa, and expansion of potential pathogens. These key features of ICU gut dysbiosis have been associated with adverse outcomes including life-threatening hospital-acquired (nosocomial) infections. Current research strives to define cellular and molecular mechanisms connecting gut dysbiosis with infections and other outcomes, and to identify opportunities for therapeutic modulation of host-microbe interactions. This review synthesizes evidence from studies of critically ill patients that have informed our understanding of intestinal dysbiosis in the ICU, mechanisms linking dysbiosis to infections and other adverse outcomes, as well as clinical trials of microbiota-modifying therapies. Additionally, we discuss novel avenues for precision microbial therapeutics to combat nosocomial infections and other life-threatening complications of critical illness.
