24024521|a|Nanoparticles (NPs) that are ~100 nm in diameter can potentially cause toxicity in the central nervous system (CNS). Although NPs exhibit positive aspects, these molecules primarily exert negative or harmful effects. Thus, the beneficial and harmful effects should be compared. The prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, and some brain tumors, has increased. However, the major cause of these diseases remains unknown. NPs have been considered as one of the major potential causes of these diseases, penetrating the human body via different pathways. This review summarizes various pathways for NP-induced neurotoxicity, suggesting the development of strategies for nanoneuroprotection using in silico and biological methods. Studies of oxidative stress associated with gene expression analyses provide efficient information for understanding neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration associated with NPs. The brain is a sensitive and fragile organ, and evolution has developed mechanisms to protect it from injury; however, this protection also hinders the methods used for therapeutic purposes. Thus, brain and CNS-related diseases that are the cause of disability and disorder are the most difficult to treat. There are many obstacles to drug delivery in the CNS, such as the blood brain barrier and blood tumor barrier. Considering these barriers, we have reviewed the strategies available to map NPs using biological techniques. The surface adsorption energy of NPs is the basic force driving NP gathering, protein corona formation, and many other interactions of NPs within biological systems. These interactions can be described using an approach named the biological surface adsorption index. A quantitative structural activity relationship study helps to understand different protein-protein or protein-ligand interactions. Moreover, equilibrium between cerebrovascular permeability is required when a drug is transferred via the circulatory system for the therapy of neurodegenerative diseases. Various drug delivery approaches, such as chemical drug delivery and carrier-mediated drug delivery, have been established to avoid different barriers inhibiting CNS penetration by therapeutic substances. Developing an improved understanding of drug receptors and the sites of drug action, together with advances in medicinal chemistry, will make it possible to design drugs with greatly enhanced activity and selectivity; this may result in a significant increase in the therapeutic index.
