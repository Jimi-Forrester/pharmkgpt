35028242|t|A Description of Novel Uses of Hip Protectors in an Elderly Hip Fracture Population: A Technical Report.
35028242|a|Hip fractures are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the elderly population. The number of hip fractures is set to increase significantly by 2050 as the global population ages. The costs associated with hip fracture patients are significant due to prolonged hospitalisation and rehabilitation. Hip protectors have been advocated as a strategy to reduce the risk of hip fractures in a high-risk population. Evidence suggests that hip protectors are a cost-effective method for reducing the risk of hip fractures. There have, however, been issues with adherence with wearing hip protectors amongst patients and healthcare staff. Despite prevention strategies, many patients continue to present with hip fractures. Many of these patients have cognitive impairment or experience peri-operative delirium. This can cause issues with patients' interference with the operative wound and presents a significant burden to the healthcare team with the need for increased wound monitoring and care in the post-operative period. Applying a well-fitted hip protector provides a substantial additional barrier to protect the surgical wound. Hip fracture surgical wounds can be difficult to manage in these patients and our standard post-operative protocol is to apply compression dressings in this group of patients. We have found that a well-fitted hip protector can provide adequate compression to the surgical site. We describe a brief technical report on a novel use of hip protectors in providing wound security in the agitated patient post-operatively as well as a method of providing compression to the surgical wound site.
