23112008|a|Understanding the structure of amyloid-beta (Abeta) aggregates is a key step towards elucidating the pathology of Alzheimer's disease. In this work, three fragments of the Abeta(1-42) protein, Abeta(1-25) (DAEFRHDSGYEVHHQKLVFFAEDVG), Abeta(25-35) (GSNKGAIIGLM), and Abeta(33-42) (GLMVGGVVIA), were synthesized, and their aggregated structures were examined by linear infrared spectroscopy in the amide-I (mainly the C=O stretching) region. The structures of the formed aggregates were found to be both sequence and pH dependent. The results suggest that instead of forming matured fibrils, as in the case of full-length Abeta(1-42), both Abeta(1-25) and Abeta(33-42) form a mixture of threadlike beta-sheet fibril, soluble beta-sheet oligomer, and random coil structures. The beta-sheet conformations were found to be mainly antiparallel for the former and both parallel and antiparallel for the latter. However, the Abeta(25-35) fragment was found to form assembled fibrils containing predominantly parallel beta-sheets. The conformation and morphology of the aggregates were also confirmed by circular dichroism measurements and transmission electron microscopy. Factors influencing the structures of the aggregates formed by the Abeta fragments were discussed.
