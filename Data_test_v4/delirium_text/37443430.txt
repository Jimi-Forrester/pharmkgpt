37443430|t|Caring for critically ill patients with a mental illness: A discursive paper providing an overview and case exploration of the delivery of intensive care to people with psychiatric comorbidity.
37443430|a|AIM: To address the need for additional education in the management of mental illness in the critical care setting by providing a broad overview of the interrelationship between critical illness and mental illness. The paper also offers practical advice to support critical care staff in managing patients with mental illness in critical care by discussing two hypothetical case scenarios involving aggressive and disorganised behaviour. People living with mental illness are over-represented among critically unwell patients and experience worse outcomes, contributing to a life expectancy up to 30 years shorter than their peers. Strategic documents call for these inequitable outcomes to be addressed. Staff working in intensive care units (ICUs) possess advanced knowledge and specialist skills in managing critical illness but have reported limited confidence in managing patients with comorbid mental illness. DESIGN & METHODS: A discursive paper, drawing on clinical experience and research of the authors and current literature. RESULTS: Like all people, patients with mental illnesses draw on their cognitive, behavioural, social and spiritual resources to cope with their experiences during critical illness. However, they may have fewer resources available due to co-morbid mental illness, a history of trauma and social disadvantage. By identifying and sensitively addressing patients' underlying needs in a trauma-informed way, demonstrating respect and maximising patient autonomy, staff can reduce distress and disruptive behaviours and promote recovery. Caring for patients who are distressed and/or display challenging behaviours can evoke strong and unpleasant emotional responses. Self-care is fundamental to maintaining a compassionate approach and effective clinical judgement. Staff should be enabled to accept and acknowledge emotional responses and access support-informally with peers and/or through formal mechanisms as needed. Organisational leadership and endorsement of the principles of equitable care are critical to creation of the environment needed to improve outcomes for staff and patients. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: ICU nurses hold an important role in the care of patients with critical illnesses and are ideally placed to empower, advocate for and comfort those patients also living with mental illness. To perform these tasks optimally and sustainably, health services have a responsibility to provide nursing staff with adequate education and training in the management of mental illnesses, and sufficient formal and informal support to maintain their own well-being while providing this care. PATIENT AND PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT: This paper is grounded in accounts of patients with mental illness and clinicians providing care to patients with mental illness in critical care settings but there was no direct patient or public contribution.
