38034226|t|Quantification of Dysautonomia in Major Depressive Disorder Using the Composite Autonomic Scoring Scale-31 (COMPASS-31).
38034226|a|Background Dysautonomia denotes an alteration in the autonomic nervous system that can significantly lead to multiorgan failure. Conversely, depression not only affects cognitive functions but also poses a risk factor for sudden cardiac death. In our study, the Composite Autonomic Scoring-31 (COMPASS-31) is used to quantify the autonomic symptoms present if any in patients with depression. Materials and methods Forty-two patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) were recruited using a PHQ-9 questionnaire followed by a COMPASS-31 scale to quantify dysautonomia symptoms, and they were compared with healthy controls. Further regression analysis was conducted to establish any relationship between independent variables and COMPASS-31 scores. Results  The average COMPASS-31 score in patients with MDD was 22.56+-8.42, which was significantly increased compared to healthy controls (p=0.001). Furthermore, the differences persisted across various subdomains of the COMPASS-31 scale relative to severity of depression. Conclusion The study observations could provide a relevant perception regarding the association between depression and autonomic dysfunction with the use of a simple and brief yet validated instrument COMPASS-31, which can be utilized for screening at the primary care level.
