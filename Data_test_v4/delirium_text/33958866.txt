33958866|a|PURPOSE: Post-stroke depression (PSD) affects one third of stroke survivors, with multiple severe negative consequences. We aim to assess the weight of four different types of clinical risk factors for PSD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study in a stroke centre. After stroke, patients were assessed for cognitive performances, psychiatric standardized questionnaires and socio-demographic features. They were called three months after and assessed for major depressive episode using DSM criteria. RESULTS: PSD was diagnosed in 8 of the 59 (13.6%) patients enrolled in the study. After multivariate analysis, only "previous history of depressive episode" remained a significant predictive factor for PSD, the model explaining 19% of the total variance (OR=18.0; p=0.002). Patients with a previous history of depression had a 10-fold increased risk for PSD. CONCLUSION: Previous history of depression is confirmed as a strong risk factor for PDS and allow the identification of an at-risk sub-group of patients.
