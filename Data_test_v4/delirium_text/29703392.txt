29703392|a|OBJECTIVE: To analyse the activity of interconsultations conducted by internal medicine (IM) departments, their formal aspects and the profile of clinical care required and to quantify the workload they represent. MATERIAL AND METHOD: A multicentre, observational prospective study was conducted with consecutive hospitalised patients treated by IM departments using interconsultations between May 15 and June 15, 2016. We estimated the workload related to this activity (1time unit [TU]=10min). RESULTS: We recorded 1,141 interconsultations from 43 hospitals. The mean age of the patients involved was 69.4 years (SD: 16.2), and 51.2% were men. The mean Charlson index was 2.3 (SD: 2.2). The most common reasons for the consultations were general assessments (27.4%), fever (18.1%), dyspnoea (13.6%), metabolic disorder (9.6%), arterial hypertension (6.3%) and delirium (5.3%). The duration of the first visit was 4 TUs (SD: 5.9) and 7.3 (SD: 21.5) for the sum of all subsequent visits. The surgical patients were older (70.6 [SD, 15.9] vs. 64.4 [SD, 16.3] years; P=.0001) and required more follow-up time (5 [SD, 7.3] vs. 3.5 [SD, 4.2] days; P=.009). The following issues were more common in the interconsultation format performed by medical services: number of regular interconsultations (response >24h), specification of the reason for the interconsultation, minimal data regarding the medical history and agreement on the appropriateness of the time spent with the consultant. CONCLUSION: The patients treated through interconsultations by the IM departments represented a significant workload. The interconsultations from the medical departments were more in line with the request format.
