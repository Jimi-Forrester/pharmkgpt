8461968|t|Familial Alzheimer's disease. A pedigree with a mis-sense mutation in the amyloid precursor protein gene (amyloid precursor protein 717 valine-->glycine).
8461968|a|Ten affected individuals are described from a kindred with autosomal dominant familial Alzheimer's disease in which a mutation in the amyloid precursor protein gene results in a valine to glycine substitution at amyloid precursor protein 717 which co-segregates with the disease. The mean age at onset of symptoms was 52 years with a range from 40 years to 67 years. The median duration of the disease was 11 years, with a range of 7-16 years. All individuals fulfilled the National Institute for Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke criteria for probable Alzheimer's disease. A homogeneous clinical and neuropsychological pattern was evident within the family. Myoclonic jerks, seizures, depression and a lack of insight were common features. Positron emission tomography demonstrated biparietal bitemporal hypometabolism in the one affected individual who was studied. The diagnosis was confirmed histopathologically in one individual.
