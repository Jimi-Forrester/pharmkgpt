37445580|t|Underdiagnosed CKD in Geriatric Trauma Patients and Potent Prevention of Renal Impairment from Polypharmacy Risks through Individual Pharmacotherapy Management (IPM-III).
37445580|a|The aging global patient population with multimorbidity and concomitant polypharmacy is at increased risk for acute and chronic kidney disease, particularly with severe additional disease states or invasive surgical procedures. Because from the expertise of more than 58,600 self-reviewed medications, adverse drug reactions, drug interactions, inadequate dosing, and contraindications all proved to cause or exacerbate the worsening of renal function, we analyzed the association of an electronic patient record- and Summaries of Product Characteristics (SmPCs)-based comprehensive individual pharmacotherapy management (IPM) in the setting of 14 daily interdisciplinary patient visits with the outcome: further renal impairment with reduction of eGFR >= 20 mL/min (redGFR) in hospitalized trauma patients >= 70 years of age. The retrospective clinical study of 404 trauma patients comparing the historical control group (CG) before IPM with the IPM intervention group (IG) revealed a group-match in terms of potential confounders such as age, sex, BMI, arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and injury patterns. Preexisting chronic kidney disease (CKD) > stage 2 diagnosed as eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 on hospital admission was 42% in the CG versus 50% in the IG, although in each group only less than 50% of this was coded as an ICD diagnosis in the patients' discharge letters (19% in CG and 21% in IG). IPM revealed an absolute risk reduction in redGFR of 5.5% (11 of 199 CG patients) to 0% in the IPM visit IG, a relative risk reduction of 100%, NNT 18, indicating high efficacy of IPM and benefit in improving outcomes. There even remained an additive superimposed significant association that included patients in the IPM group before/beyond the 14 daily IPM interventions, with a relative redGFR risk reduction of 0.55 (55%) to 2.5% (5 of 204 patients), OR 0.48 [95% CI 0.438-0.538] (p < 0.001). Bacteriuria, loop diuretics, allopurinol, eGFR >= 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, and CKD 3b were significantly associated with redGFR; of the latter, 10.5% developed redGFR. Further multivariable regression analysis adjusting for these and established risk factors revealed an additive, superimposed IPM effect on redGFR with an OR 0.238 [95% CI 0.06-0.91], relative risk reduction of 76.2%, regression coefficient -1.437 including patients not yet visited in the IPM period. As consequences of the IPM procedure, the IG differed from the CG by a significant reduction of NSAIDs (p < 0.001), HCT (p = 0.028) and Wurzburger pain drip (p < 0.001), and significantly increased prescription rate of antibiotics (p = 0.004). In conclusion, (1) more than 50% of CKD in geriatric patients was not pre-recognized and underdiagnosed, and (2) the electronic patient records-based IPM interdisciplinary networking strategy was associated with effective prevention of further periinterventional renal impairment and requires obligatory implementation in all elderly patients to urgently improve patient and drug safety.
