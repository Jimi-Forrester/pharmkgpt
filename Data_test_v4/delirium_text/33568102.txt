33568102|t|Utilization of potentially inappropriate medication and risk of adverse drug events among older adults with chronic renal insufficiency: a population-wide cohort study.
33568102|a|BACKGROUND: The use of potentially inappropriate medication (PIM) in population of older adults may result in adverse drug events (ADE) already after short term exposure, especially when it is prescribed to patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). In order to limit ADE in the treatment of older adults PIM lists have been constructed as a source of information for healthcare professionals. The aim of this study was to estimate the utilization of PIM and incidence of ADE in older adults (>=70 years) with CKD. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective population-wide cohort study including patients from Lower Austria who were 70 years or older and diagnosed with CKD in the period from 2008 to 2011. Utilization of PIM was estimated from prescriptions filled by target population. We estimated risks of hospitalization due to ADE within 30 days after incident PIM prescription and compared them to a PIM-free control group by using marginal structural models (MSM). RESULTS: We identified 11,547 patients (women: 50.6%, median age in 2008: 78 years) who fulfilled the inclusion criteria. In total 24.7 and 8.1% of all prescriptions from that period contained a medication with a substance listed in the EU (7)-PIM and AT-PIM list, respectively. Proton pump inhibitors and Ginkgo biloba were the most often prescribed PIMs in this population. 94.6 and 79.3% patients filled at least one EU(7)-PIM and AT-PIM prescription, respectively. Despite the relatively high utilization of PIM there was only a low incidence of clinically relevant ADE. No event type exceeded the threshold level of 1% in the analysis of risks of ADE after filling a prescription for PIM. Nevertheless, MSM analysis showed an increased risk for 11 drugs and reduced risk for 4 drugs. CONCLUSIONS: PIM prescription was common among older adults with CKD, however, only a small number of these drugs eventually led to hospitalization due to ADE within 30 days after incident PIM was filled. In the absence of a clinically important PIM-related increase in risk, an assessment of potential ADE severity to a PIM list by using a warning score system seems prudent.
