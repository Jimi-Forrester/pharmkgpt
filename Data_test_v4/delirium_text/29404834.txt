29404834|t|Managing the Mental Distress of the Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant (HSCT) Patient: a Focus on Delirium.
29404834|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To highlight the breadth and types of mental distress experienced by hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) patients and highlight the need for better prevention and management of delirium. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent publications highlight additional risks factors which predict for mental distress during the HSCT process. Despite new medications and additional psychological reports, there is little progress in non-pharmacologic or medication therapy in the prevention and treatment of delirium. Mental distress, especially delirium, is common during the HSCT process. The morbidity associated with delirium and other mental distress can still be significant at 6-12 months after the completion of the procedure affecting patient functioning and quality of life (QOL). Medication interventions may be helpful but should be used sparingly for targeted patients during HSCT. Additional interventions are needed to prevent and treat delirium in HSCT patients.
