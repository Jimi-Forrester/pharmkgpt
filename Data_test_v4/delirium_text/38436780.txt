38436780|t|Silica Nanoparticles Decrease Glutamate Uptake in Blood-Brain Barrier Components.
38436780|a|Glutamate is the major excitatory amino acid in the vertebrate brain, playing an important role in most brain functions. It exerts its activity through plasma membrane receptors and transporters, expressed both in neurons and glia cells. Overstimulation of neuronal glutamate receptors is linked to cell death in a process known as excitotoxicity, that is prevented by the efficient removal of the neurotransmitter through glutamate transporters enriched in the glia plasma membrane and in the components of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Silica nanoparticles (SiO2-NPs) have been widely used in biomedical applications and directed to enter the circulatory system; however, little is known about the potential adverse effects of SiO2-NPs exposure on the BBB transport systems that support the critical isolation function between the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral circulation. In this contribution, we investigated the plausible SiO2-NPs-mediated disruption of the glutamate transport system expressed by BBB cell components. First, we evaluated the cytotoxic effect of SiO2-NPs on human brain endothelial (HBEC) and Uppsala 87 Malignant glioma (U-87MG) cell lines. Transport kinetics were evaluated, and the exposure effect of SiO2-NPs on glutamate transport activity was determined in both cell lines. Exposure of the cells to different SiO2-NP concentrations (0.4, 4.8, 10, and 20 microg/ml) and time periods (3 and 6 h) did not affect cell viability. We found that the radio-labeled D-aspartate ([3H]-D-Asp) uptake is mostly sodium-dependent, and downregulated by its own substrate (glutamate). Furthermore, SiO2-NPs exposure on endothelial and astrocytes decreases [3H]-D-Asp uptake in a dose-dependent manner. Interestingly, a decrease in the transporter catalytic efficiency, probably linked to a diminution in the affinity of the transporter, was detected upon SiO2-NPs. These results favor the notion that exposure to SiO2-NPs could disrupt BBB function and by these means shed some light into our understanding of the deleterious effects of air pollution on the CNS.
