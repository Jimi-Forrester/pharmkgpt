12205648|t|Treatment with simvastatin in normocholesterolemic patients with Alzheimer's disease: A 26-week randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial.
12205648|a|In a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study, we investigated whether statins alter cholesterol metabolites and reduce Abeta levels in the cerebrospinal fluid of 44 patients with Alzheimer's disease. Individuals were given up to 80mg simvastatin daily or placebo for 26 weeks. Overall, simvastatin did not significantly alter cerebrospinal fluid levels of Abeta40 and Abeta42. In post hoc analysis, simvastatin significantly decreased Abeta40 levels in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with mild Alzheimer's disease. The reduction of Abeta40 correlated with the reduction of 24S-hydroxycholesterol. These changes were not observed in more severely affected patients.
