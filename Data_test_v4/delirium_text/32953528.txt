32953528|t|Targeting ferroptosis for cancer therapy: exploring novel strategies from its mechanisms and role in cancers.
32953528|a|Ferroptosis is a novel form of non-apoptotic regulated cell death (RCD), with distinct characteristics and functions in physical conditions and multiple diseases such as cancers. Unlike apoptosis and autophagy, this new RCD is an iron-dependent cell death with features of lethal accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and over production of lipid peroxidation. Excessive iron from aberrant iron metabolisms or the maladjustment of the two main redox systems thiols and lipid peroxidation role as the major causes of ROS generation, and the redox-acrive ferrous (intracellular labile iron) is a crucial factor for the lipid peroxidation. Regulation of ferrroptosis also involves different pathways such as mevalonate pathway, P53 pathway and p62-Keap1-Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) pathway. Ferroptosis roles as a double-edged sword either suppressing or promoting tumor progression with the release of multiple signaling molecules in the tumor microenvironment. Emerging evidence suggests ferroptosis as a potential target for cancer therapy and ferroptosis inducers including small molecules and nanomaterials have been developed. The application of ferroptosis inducers also relates to overcoming drug resistance and preventing tumor metastasis, and may become a promising strategy combined with other anti-cancer therapies. Here, we summarize the ferroptosis characters from its underlying basis and role in cancer, followed by its possible applications in cancer therapies and challenges maintained.
