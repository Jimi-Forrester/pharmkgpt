31521488|t|The Utility of Episodic Memory Cut-Off Scores for Inclusion in Clinical Trials for Early Symptomatic Alzheimer Disease.
31521488|a|Correctly diagnosing early symptomatic Alzheimer disease in the context of multinational clinical trials poses a significant challenge. Subjective complaints of memory are fairly ubiquitous in an older population, and establishing the presence of definitive cognitive decline from clinical assessments is difficult. Most such trials have adopted the use of standardized episodic memory measures as an inclusion criterion, typically setting the cutoff at one standard deviation below age normal means. This is useful in terms of establishing the presence of an objective impairment of memory, thereby excluding subjects with purely subjective complaints and increasing the probability that clinical outcome measures will be sensitive to disease progression. Further demographic adjustments are unnecessary as other demographic variables are not strongly associated with memory performance, are difficult to equate across cultures, and will not eventuate in reduced screen fail rates and would be challenging to implement. Not all episodic memory measures are equivalent for this purpose, however, and existing data suggest significant variability in terms of specificity for identifying true (i.e., amyloid positive) early symptomatic AD.
