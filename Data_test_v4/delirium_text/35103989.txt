35103989|a|BACKGROUND: Artificial hydration (AH) is a challenging issue in terminally ill patients with cancer, because it influences patients' symptoms control, quality of life, and quality of dying (QOD). To date, it is not clear how much AH supply is proper for imminently dying patients. This study aimed to investigate the association between the amount of AH and QOD. METHODS: This study is part of the East Asian Collaborative Cross-Cultural Study to Elucidate the Dying Process (EASED) conducted in Japan, Korea, and Taiwan from January 2017 to September 2018. Patients' demographics, symptoms, and managements on admission to palliative care units (PCUs) and before death were recorded. The AH amount was classified into different groups by 250-mL intervals to compare their difference. The Good Death Scale (GDS) was used to measure QOD, with patients classified into higher or lower QOD groups using GDS = 12 as the cutoff point. We used logistic regression analysis to assess the association between AH amount and QOD. RESULTS: In total, 1530 patients were included in the analysis. Country, religion, spiritual well-being, fatigue, delirium, dyspnea, AH, and antibiotics use before death were significantly associated with QOD. After conducting regression analysis, patients administered with 250 to 499 mL AH had significantly better QOD (odds ratio, 2.251; 95% confidence interval, 1.072-4.730; P = .032) than those without AH. CONCLUSIONS: AH use impacts the QOD of terminally ill patients with cancer admitted to PCUs. Communication with patients and their families on appropriate AH use has a positive effect on QOD. LAY SUMMARY: Our prospective cross-cultural multicenter study aims to investigate the relationship between artificial hydration (AH) amount and quality of dying among terminally ill patients with cancer. The findings reveal that country, religion, spiritual well-being, fatigue, delirium, dyspnea, AH, and antibiotics use before death were significantly associated with quality of death (QOD). After multivariable logistic regression, patients administered with AH amount 250 to 499 mL had significantly better QOD (odds ratio, 2.251; 95% confidence interval, 1.072-4.730; P = .032) than those without AH. Communication with patients and their families regarding AH is recommended as it may help them be better prepared for the end-of-life stage and achieve a good death.
