2071697|t|Alz-50 immunoreactivity in the hypothalamus of the normal and Alzheimer human and the rat.
2071697|a|Alz-50 is a monoclonal antibody recognizing a 68 kilodalton protein that is abundant in Alzheimer's disease (AD) but not detectable by immunoblotting methods in normal brains. When used for immunohistochemistry in AD cortex, Alz-50 recognizes large numbers of neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), neuritic plaques, and some neurons that show no evidence of neurofibrillary degeneration by conventional histopathological staining methods. Alz-50 immunoreactivity is described at the light and electron microscopic levels in the hypothalamus of brains obtained at autopsy from normal and AD subjects. Alz-50 immunoreactivity in the rat hypothalamus is also described. A well-defined population of Alz-50 immunoreactive hypothalamic neurons was identified in both the normal human and rat. At the light microscopic level in the normal human, immunoreactive neurons were most concentrated in the periventricular region, but were also scattered throughout the arcuate nucleus (ARC), lateral hypothalamic area, and tuberal region. Immunoreactive fibers were seen in the periventricular region, dorsal division of the ventromedial nucleus (VMNd), ARC, and external layer of the median eminence (ME). In the rat, reactive neurons were seen only in the periventricular region, and reactive fibers were seen in the periventricular zone, medial preoptic nuclear complex, suprachiasmatic nucleus, VMNd, ARC, and external layer of the ME. Ultrastructurally, all immunoreactivity in the normal human and rat hypothalamus was associated with intraneuronal vesicles. In the AD hypothalamus, Alz-50 identified numerous senile plaques and NFT in addition to the cells and fibers that were stained in the normal brains. Immunoreactive plaques and NFT were most numerous in regions previously reported to undergo neurofibrillary degeneration. At the ultrastructural level, the immunoreactivity in the AD hypothalamus was associated with filaments as well as vesicles. The significance of the selective staining of a specific population of vesicles by Alz-50 is unknown; however, the present results suggest that it is independent of AD pathology.
