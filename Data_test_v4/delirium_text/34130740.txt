34130740|t|Stroke associated with Mycoplasma hominis infection: a case report.
34130740|a|BACKGROUND: Mycoplasmas are the smallest prokaryotic microorganisms in nature. Many cases of stroke post-Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection have been reported, particularly in the pediatric population. However, Mycoplasma hominis infection has not previously been associated with stroke. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 36-year-old Greek woman who presented with an extensive stroke with an unspecified cause. She had a concurrent genital infection with Mycoplasma hominis for an unknown duration. CONCLUSION: An association may exist between stroke and the immune response to Mycoplasma hominis infection.
