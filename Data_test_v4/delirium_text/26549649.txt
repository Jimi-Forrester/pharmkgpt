26549649|t|Selenium in the Therapy of Neurological Diseases. Where is it Going?
26549649|a|Selenium (34Se), an antioxidant trace element, is an important regulator of brain function. These beneficial properties that Se possesses are attributed to its ability to be incorporated into selenoproteins as an amino acid. Several selenoproteins are expressed in the brain, in which some of them, e.g. glutathione peroxidases (GPxs), thioredoxin reductases (TrxRs) or selenoprotein P (SelP), are strongly involved in antioxidant defence and in maintaining intercellular reducing conditions. Since increased oxidative stress has been implicated in neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, stroke, epilepsy and others, a growing body of evidence suggests that Se depletion followed by decreased activity of Se-dependent enzymes may be important factors connected with those pathologies. Undoubtedly, the remarkable progress that has been made in understanding the biological function of Se in the brain has opened up new potential possibilities for the treatment of neurological diseases by using Se as a potential drug. However, further research in the search for optimal Se donors is necessary in order to achieve an effective and safe therapeutic income.
