36993050|a|Background: Polypharmacy and inappropriate prescribing are risk factors for adverse clinical outcomes in older people. Screening tools can identify potential medicine-related patient safety incidents for the elderly on multiple medicines and with chronic diseases. Methods: In this prospective observational study, details of demography, diagnosis, history of constipation/peptic ulcer disease, over-the-counter medications, and clinical and laboratory findings were noted. Information obtained was reviewed and analyzed with the help of STOPP/START and Beers 2019 criteria. At 1 month follow-up, improvement was assessed with the help of a structured questionnaire. Results: As per the criteria, modification in drugs was recommended for 213 drugs; it was actually performed for 27.73% and 48.71% drugs as per Beers and STOPP/START criteria, respectively. Glimepiride was replaced with short-acting sulfonylureas because of hypoglycemia, and angiotensin receptor blockers were stopped because of hyperkalemia as per Beers criteria. Statins were started in 19 patients by START criteria. Overall general health improvement was observed at 1 month, but an increase in anxiety, tension, worry, depressed feel, and insomnia was observed in initial days of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Conclusions: In view of polypharmacy in the prescriptions, the combination of prescribing criteria need to be considered while prescribing medications to the elderly to get optimum therapeutic benefits and improvement in the quality of life. The quality of primary care of the elderly can also be improved by use of screening tools such as STOPP/START and Beers criteria by a primary/family physician. Prescription evaluation by a trained pharmacologist/physician for possible drug/food/disease interactions and for therapy modification can be incorporated for routine geriatric care at a tertiary care center.
