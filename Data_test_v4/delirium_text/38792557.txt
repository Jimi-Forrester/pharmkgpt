38792557|t|Deregulated Long Non-Coding RNAs (lncRNA) as Promising Biomarkers in Hidradenitis Suppurativa.
38792557|a|Background/Objectives: In recent times, epigenetics alterations in Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) have been explored and exploited translationally to guide investigation of new therapeutic approaches. On the other hand, long noncoding RNAs (LncRNAs), main regulators of the epigenetic status of the human genome, have been scarcely investigated, notwithstanding their potential relevance in broad pathogenesis comprehension. Here, we aim to explore the methylation pattern of lncRNAs in HS. Methods: In this case-control study, 24 HS patients and age-, sex- and BMI-matched controls were analyzed to characterize the methylome of lncRNA genes in peripheral blood cells. Gene ontology analysis (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, and MCODE analysis were performed. Results: A set of fifteen lncRNA genes exhibited significantly differential methylation patterns, with ten of them showing hypomethylation and five displaying hypermethylation at specific CpG sites. The hypomethylated lncRNA genes were DLEU2, MESTIT1, CASC2, TUG1, KCNQ1DN, PSORS1C3, PCA3, DSCR8, RFPL1S, and PVT1, while the hypermethylated ones were HAR1A, FAM66B, SNHG9, HCG9, and HCP5. These lncRNA genes have been linked to various important biological processes, including cell proliferation, apoptosis, inflammation, chronic inflammatory skin diseases, and wound healing. Their altered methylation status suggests potential roles in regulating these processes, and may contribute to HS pathogenesis and healing mechanisms. Conclusions: This study revealed an interesting dysregulation pattern of definite lncRNAs in the methylome which is linked to both the development of HS and its comorbidities. Epigenetically altered lncRNAs genes could represent useful biomarkers, and could help in guiding innovative treatment strategies.
