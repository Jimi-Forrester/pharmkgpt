12180033|a|Orthotopic heart transplantation is a major surgical intervention inducing conscious and unconscious psychological distress. Though all reports indicated global improvement of quality of life from pre- to post-transplantation, most retrospective and longitudinal studies found a high prevalence of psychopathology before and after surgery. Post-operative acute psychotic disorders are uncommon but they severely hamper the medical progress and require an immediate psychiatric assistance. The case of Pascal, a young receiver who presented a brief persecution delusional disorder after the first transplantation, showed the dramatic character of such unexpected symptoms.
