37961937|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the major devastating neurodegenerative disorders associated with the gradual decline of an individual's memory, cognition, and ability to carry out day-to-day activities. In the present study, the neuroprotective ability of alpha-bisabolol beta-d-fucopyranoside (ABFP) was assessed via measurement of antioxidant parameters like lipid peroxidation, glutathione peroxidation, glutathione, protein carbonyl content assays, and caspase-3 activity estimation. Moreover, the acute toxicity of ABFP was estimated in the zebrafish larval model. The results showed that ABFP exhibits little to no toxicity at lower concentrations in the acute toxicity test. ABFP-pretreated and scopolamine-exposed fish exhibited more exploratory behavior in the behavior assay than scopolamine-only induced groups. Additionally, the results of antioxidant enzyme assays revealed reduced oxidative stress and damage in ABFP-treated fish, while enzyme activity experiments carried out with brain homogenate from ABFP-treated fish showed decreased acetylcholinesterase enzyme activity. Overall, it can be concluded that ABFP has the potential to be a promising agent for the treatment of AD in the future.
