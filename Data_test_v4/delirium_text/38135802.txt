38135802|t|Association Between Antidiabetic Drugs and Delirium: A Study Based on the Adverse Drug Event Reporting Database in Japan.
38135802|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Several associations between diabetes mellitus and delirium have been reported; however, they have been inconsistent, and evidence on the effects of antidiabetic medications on delirium is also limited. This study aimed to investigate whether the use of antidiabetic drugs is a risk factor for delirium development. METHODS: Using the Japanese Adverse Event Reporting Database, we analyzed 662,899 reports between 2004 and 2022. Reporting odds ratios (RORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for delirium associated with diabetes and using each antidiabetic medication were calculated after adjusting for potential confounders. RESULTS: Overall, 8892 of the reports analyzed were associated with delirium. A comparison of the incidence of delirium between patients with and without diabetes showed no significant difference, with 1.34% in patients without diabetes and 1.37% in those with diabetes. In each antidiabetic medication, signals for delirium were detected for sulfonylurea (crude ROR, 1.35; 95% CI 1.21-1.51) and insulin (crude ROR, 1.28; 95% CI 1.13-1.44). These results were maintained even after adjusting for factors with potential confounders (sulfonylurea: adjusted ROR, 1.75; 95% CI 1.54-2.00, insulin: adjusted ROR, 1.35; 95% CI 1.20-1.54). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest no association between diabetes and delirium; however, using sulfonylurea and insulin may be associated with delirium development. Nonetheless, these findings should be validated in future studies.
