30572656|t|Extracellular Interactions of Alpha-Synuclein in Multiple System Atrophy.
30572656|a|Multiple system atrophy, characterized by atypical Parkinsonism, results from central nervous system (CNS) cell loss and dysfunction linked to aggregates of the normally pre-synaptic alpha-synuclein protein. Mostly cytoplasmic pathological alpha-synuclein inclusion bodies occur predominantly in oligodendrocytes in affected brain regions and there is evidence that alpha-synuclein released by neurons is taken up preferentially by oligodendrocytes. However, extracellular alpha-synuclein has also been shown to interact with other neural cell types, including astrocytes and microglia, as well as extracellular factors, mediating neuroinflammation, cell-to-cell spread and other aspects of pathogenesis. Here, we review the current evidence for how alpha-synuclein present in the extracellular milieu may act at the cell surface to drive components of disease progression. A more detailed understanding of the important extracellular interactions of alpha-synuclein with neuronal and non-neuronal cell types both in the brain and periphery may provide new therapeutic targets to modulate the disease process.
