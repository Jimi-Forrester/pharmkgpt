28833176|a|Sporadic, age-related cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is most commonly recognized clinically as a cause of hemorrhagic stroke and transient focal neurological episodes in older persons. But a growing body of research in the last 5 years shows that the pathophysiology of CAA is much more complex than previously believed, leading to many different types of brain injury. CAA has now been linked with brain atrophy in regions remote from those directly affected by intracerebral hematomas, and with risk for progressive cognitive decline in the absence of new hemorrhagic strokes. Therefore, CAA is associated with features - brain atrophy and progressive cognitive decline - that are typically considered hallmarks of neurodegenerative disease. Although CAA is usually accompanied by some degree of Alzheimer's disease pathology, the profiles of cortical thinning and cognitive impairment do not fully overlap with those seen in Alzheimer's disease, suggesting that there are CAA-specific pathways of neurodegeneration. CAA-related brain ischemia may be an important mechanism that leads to brain injury, cortical disconnection, and cognitive impairment. This article is part of the Special Issue "Vascular Dementia".
