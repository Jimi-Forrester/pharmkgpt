37407872|t|CRP/albumin, Glasgow prognostic score, and prognostic nutritional index as a predictor of mortality among delirium patients.
37407872|a|BACKGROUND: With the older populations growing each year, high mortality rates make delirium a valuable topic. AIM: We aimed to analyze the parameters that could predict 30 days of mortality of the patients diagnosed in the emergency department (ED) with delirium. METHODS: This retrospective study included 85 patients with a diagnosis of delirium. Glasgow prognostic score (GPS), prognostic nutritional index (PNI), and C-reactive protein (CRP)/albumin values of the patients and 30-day mortality rate were computed. The effectiveness of GPS, PNI, and CRP/albumin parameters in predicting 30-day mortality was analyzed. RESULTS: The findings showed that the optimal cut-off value for albumin as determined by Youden's index in estimation of 30-day mortality was <= 36.8 [AUC: 0.830 (95% CI: 0.733-0.903; p < 0.001), with a sensitivity of 85.71% and specificity of 76.36%], while cut-off value for CRP/albumin was > 0.974 [AUC: 0.753 (95% CI: 0.647-0.840; p < 0.001); with a sensitivity of 85.71% and specificity of 70.51%], and cut-off value for PNI was <= 39.05 [AUC: 0.850 (95% CI: 0.756-0.918; p < 0.001) sensitivity 71.43% and specificity 92.31%]. Significant effectiveness of the values of GPS (odds ratio (OR) = 6.69; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.69-26.37), PNI (OR = 0.83; 95% CI: 0.74-0.95), albumin (OR = 0.82; 95% CI: 0.71-0.94), and CAD (OR = 10.5; 95% CI: 1.85-59.45) was observed for predicting mortality in univariate regression analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The findings obtained in this study suggest that GPS, PNI, and albumin parameters could be used to guide the clinician in predicting the 30-day mortality of patients diagnosed with delirium.
