21397462|a|Recent GWAS identified a risk variant for Alzheimer's disease (AD) at a locus (rs11136000) of the clusterin gene (CLU). Here we use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during working memory to probe the effect of the risk variant on brain activation in healthy individuals. Participants with the CLU risk genotype had higher activity than participants with the protective allele in frontal and posterior cingulate cortex and the hippocampus, particularly during high memory demand. These results inform pathophysiological models of the preclinical progression of AD.
