3665832|t|Alcohol withdrawal seizures.
3665832|a|Seizures that occur in relation to alcohol withdrawal, following a period of prolonged intoxication in serious alcoholics, constitute a special syndrome with important prognostic and therapeutic implications. Inpatient management is desirable to eliminate other causes of seizures that occur for the first time in adult life and because such patients are at substantial risk for additional seizures and the development of delirium tremens. Drug therapy with benodiazepines may be effective during the withdrawal period but long-term anticonvulsant treatment is of no value.
