38349535|t|IgG glycopeptide enrichment using hydrophilic interaction chromatography-based solid-phase extraction on an aminopropyl column.
38349535|a|The sample preparation step is pivotal in glycoproteomic analysis. An effective approach in glycoprotein sample preparation involves enriching glycopeptides by solid-phase extraction (SPE) using polar stationary phases in hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) mode. The aim of this work is to show how different experimental conditions influence the enrichment efficiency of glycopeptides from human immunoglobulin G (IgG) on an aminopropyl-modified SPE column. Different compositions of the elution solvent (acetonitrile, methanol, and isopropanol), along with varying concentrations of elution solvent acidifiers (formic and acetic acid), and different concentrations of acetonitrile for the conditioning and washing solvents (65%, 75%, and 85% acetonitrile) were tested to observe their effects on the glycopeptide enrichment process. Isopropanol proved less effective in enriching glycopeptides, while acetonitrile was the most efficient, with methanol in between. Higher formic acid concentrations in the elution solvent weakened the ionic interactions, particularly with sialylated glycopeptides. Substituting formic acid with acetic acid led to earlier elution of more glycopeptides. The acetonitrile concentration in conditioning and washing solutions played a key role; at 65% acetonitrile, glycopeptides were not retained on the SPE column and were detected in the flow-through fraction. Ultimately, it was proven that the enrichment method was applicable to human plasma samples, resulting in a significant decrease in the abundances of non-glycosylated peptides. To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first systematic investigation into the impact of the mobile phase on glycopeptide enrichment using an aminopropyl-modified SPE column in HILIC mode. This study demonstrates the substantial impact of even minor variations in experimental conditions, which have not yet been considered in the literature, on SPE-HILIC glycopeptide enrichment. Consequently, meticulous optimization of these conditions is imperative to enhance the specificity and selectivity of glycoproteomic analysis, ensuring accurate and reliable quantification.
