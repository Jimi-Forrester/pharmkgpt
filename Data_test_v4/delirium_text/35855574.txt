35855574|a|The aim of this study is to examine perceived quality of life in Chinese older adults living with cognitive impairment and explore its associations with caregivers' characteristics. Questionnaires were administered in person to 271 caregiver-care recipient dyads from urban communities in mainland China in 2019. We used the 40-item Alzheimer's Disease-related Quality of Life tool and asked caregiver respondents to indicate care recipients' life conditions. The questionnaire asked caregivers about their sociodemographic characteristics, levels of informal social support, caregiver burden, and depressive symptoms. Caregivers' higher levels of caregiver burden (beta = > -0.19, p < .01) and depressive symptoms (beta = > -0.19, p < .01) amongst caregivers were significantly associated with lower quality of life among care recipients. Informal support from relatives and friends to caregivers did not significantly affect quality of life of care recipients. The results suggested that reducing caregivers' burden and depressive symptoms are essential to promote quality of life of care recipients. Formal support from health professionals, service organizations, and communities are urgently called to promote the wellbeing of Chinese families affected by cognitive impairment.
