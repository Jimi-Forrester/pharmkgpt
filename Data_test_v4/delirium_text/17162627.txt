17162627|a|BACKGROUND: Delirium is a common condition frequently seen in consultation-liaison psychiatry. It is especially common among medically compromised patients and is an indicator of the severity of the medical illness. In addition, it is associated with a higher morbidity, mortality or longer hospitalization. Traditionally, haloperidol has been used to treat delirium-associated agitation. However, atypical antipsychotics are being increasingly used to treat delirium. METHODS: Two case studies of delirium that were treated with 30 mg and 15 mg aripiprazole were described. The improvement of delirium was monitored using the Mini-Mental Status Exam (MMSE) and Delirium Rating Scale (DRS). RESULTS: In both cases, the patients' confusion, disorientation, and agitation improved within 7 days of treatment. In the first case, the patient's MMSE score improved from 5 to 28, while his DRS score decreased from 28 to 6. In the second case, her MMSE score improved from 7 to 27, while her DRS score went down from 18 to 6. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the utilization of aripiprazole in the successful treatment of delirium. Although these cases showed positive results, future studies should be performed in order to further substantiate its use in delirium treatment.
