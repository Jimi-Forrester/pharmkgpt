36503076|a|The design of high-efficiency scavengers targeting beta-amyloid protein (Abeta) plaques in the progress of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been recognized as an effective way to prevent and treat AD. Herein, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG)-derived carbonized polymer dots (E-CPDs) were synthesized for the first time via a hydrothermal method using EGCG, an Abeta inhibitor, as one of the raw materials. The inhibitory efficiency and fluorescent property of E-CPDs were elegantly modulated by adjusting the molar ratio of EGCG to nitrogen-containing dopant, o-phenylenediamine (oPD), and 75E-CPDs fabricated with 75 mM EGCG and 50 mM oPD showed the highest inhibitory capability. The multifunctionality of 75E-CPDs on inhibition of Abeta fibrillization, Abeta fibrils disaggregation, amyloid fluorescent detection, and intracellular reactive oxygen species scavenging was demonstrated. 75E-CPDs inhibited the formation of beta-sheet-rich Abeta aggregates, alleviated Abeta-induced cytotoxicity of cultured cells from 47% to 15%, and prolonged the lifespan of AD nematodes by scavenging in vivo amyloid plaques, demonstrating much higher performance than either EGCG or EGCG-free carbon dots. Notably, 75E-CPDs could rapidly disaggregate Abeta fibrils on "second" scale, faster than any other disaggregating agents. The aromatic structure as well as hydroxyl and carboxyl groups existing on 75E-CPDs surface, which would interact with Abeta species via hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interactions, and hydrophobic interactions, played critical roles in their inhibition and disaggregation capabilities. This work reveals that potent CDs can be fabricated by using an Abeta inhibitor as the precursor, providing a new perspective for the design of multifunctional scavengers targeting amyloid plaques. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the top ten causes of death worldwide and seriously threatens human health. Recently, carbon nanomaterials have attracted much attention because of their good biocompatibility and capability in modulating Abeta aggregation via multiple interactions. This work has for the first time fabricated epigallocatechin gallate-derived carbonized polymer dots (E-CPDs) and revealed the multifunctional potency of E-CPDs on alleviating the multifaced symptoms associated with beta-amyloid protein (Abeta) fibrillization in the progression of AD. Notably, E-CPDs exhibited enhanced fluorescence emission upon binding to Abeta fibrils, possessing potential as Abeta fluorescent probes. It is believed that this work would open a new horizon in the design of multifunctional carbon nanomaterials as a potent amyloid scavenger for AD theranostics.
