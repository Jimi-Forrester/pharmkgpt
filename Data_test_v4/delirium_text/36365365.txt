36365365|t|Cachrys spp. from Southern Italy: Phytochemical Characterization and JAK/STAT Signaling Pathway Inhibition.
36365365|a|Different phytochemical compounds have been demonstrated to modulate the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. Here, three Cachrys species from Southern Italy were investigated for both the phytochemical profile and the potential anti-inflammatory properties. The aerial parts were extracted with methanol through Naviglio Extractor , an innovative solid-liquid extraction technique that allows to obtain high quality extracts by working with gradient pressure. Extracts were analyzed with GC-MS and standardized in furanocoumarin content, resulting rich in xanthotoxin, bergapten and isopimpinellin. Given the known ability of bergapten to inhibit the JAK/STAT signaling pathway by decreasing the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-6) and inflammatory mediators (NO) in RAW 264.7 cells activated by LPS, Cachrys extracts were investigated for their biological properties. The results obtained in this study showed that Cachrys pungens extract, presenting the highest content in furanocoumarins (7.48 +- 0.48 and 2.94 +- 0.16 mg/50 mg of extract for xanthotoxin and bergapten, respectively), significantly decreased STAT3 protein levels, pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-6) and increased IL-10 anti-inflammatory cytokine. Cachrys ferulacea significantly decreased JAK2 phosphorylation, being even more effective than bergapten. In conclusion, investigated extracts could be potential candidates for the search of novel anti-inflammatory agents acting via inhibiting the JAK/STAT signaling pathway.
