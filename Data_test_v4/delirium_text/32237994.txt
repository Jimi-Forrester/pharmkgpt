32237994|t|Addressing Behavioral Symptoms of Dementia Through STAR-VA Implementation: Do Outcomes Vary by Behavior Type?
32237994|a|OBJECTIVES: The STAR-VA program in Veterans Health Administration Community Living Centers (CLCs, nursing home settings) trains teams to implement a psychosocial intervention with residents with behavioral symptoms of dementia (BSD). METHODS: Across 71 CLCs, 302 residents selected as training cases had target behaviors categorized into one of 5 types: physically aggressive (PA), physically nonaggressive, verbally aggressive, verbally nonaggressive, and behavior deficit (BD). RESULTS: Across all groups, there were significant declines in team-rated behavior frequency (36%) and severity (44%), agitation (10%), distress behaviors (42%), depression (17%), and anxiety (20%). The magnitude of changes varied across behavior category. For example, those with a PA target behavior experienced a greater percentage decline in agitation and distress behavior scores, and those with a BD target behavior experienced a greater percentage decline in depressive and anxiety symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: STAR-VA, a multicomponent intervention, is generally effective across various types of behavioral symptoms associated with dementia.
