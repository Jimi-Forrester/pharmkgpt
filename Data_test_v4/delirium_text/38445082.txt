38445082|t|Trial watch: bispecific antibodies for the treatment of relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma.
38445082|a|Immunotherapy has shaped the treatment approach to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), with rituximab leading to remarkable improvements in outcomes for both relapsed and treatment-naive patients. Recently, groundbreaking immunotherapies like chimeric antigen receptor T-cells have entered the treatment arena for relapsed/refractory (R/R) DLBCL and gained regulatory approval in several countries. The concept of harnessing a patient's own T-cells to combat cancer has been further explored through the development of bispecific antibodies (BsAbs), a class of engineered antibody products designed to simultaneously target two different antigens. These novel drugs have demonstrated impressive single-agent activity and manageable toxicity in patients with heavily pretreated B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. In this review, we provide an up-to-date overview of recently completed or ongoing BsAbs trials in patients with R/R DLBCL, including single-agent results, emerging combination data, and novel constructs.
