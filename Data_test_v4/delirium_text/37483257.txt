37483257|t|Synthesis of Bis-tetraphenylethene as a Novel Turn-On Selective Zinc Sensor.
37483257|a|The main purpose of this study is the synthesis of novel fluorescent Bis-TPE and the investigation of its wide range of photochemical behaviors. For this purpose, initially, Bis-TPE was synthesized. Following this, the interactions of Bis-TPE with a wide range of ions were studied in EtOH using ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) and fluorescence spectroscopy. As a result of all UV-vis and fluorescence studies, it was determined that Bis-TPE showed turn-on sensor features against Zn2+ ions. Moreover, the limit of detection (LOD) and Ka values of Bis-TPE/Zn2+ were calculated as 0.97 muM (970 nM) and 3.76 x 105 M-1, respectively. Moreover, all reversal studies resulted in switchable on/off variation of the alternative addition of ZnCl2 and [Bu4N]OH to Bis-TPE. This result also implies that the probe Bis-TPE also exhibits specific OH- sensor properties in the presence of zinc.
