35794254|a|Astaxanthin (3,3'-dihydroxy-beta,beta-carotene-4,4'-dione) is an orange-red, lipophilic keto-carotenoid pigment. It is majorly found in marine ecosystems particularly in aquatic animals such as salmon, shrimp, trout, krill, crayfish, and so on. It is also synthesized in microalgae Heamatococcus pluvialis, Chlorococcum, Chlorella zofingiensis, red yeast Phaffia rhodozyma and bacterium Paracoccus carotinifaciens. Some aquatic and terrestrial creatures regarded as a primary and secondary sources of the astaxanthin producing and accumulating it through their metabolic pathways. Astaxanthin is the powerful antioxidant, nutritional supplement as well as promising therapeutic compound, observed to have activities against different ravaging diseases and disorders. Researchers have reported remarkable bioactivities of astaxanthin against major non-communicable chronic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative, and immune disorders. The current review discusses some structural aspects of astaxanthin. It further elaborates its multiple potencies such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-proliferative, anti-cancer, anti-obese, anti-diabetic, anti-ageing, anti-TB, anti-viral, anti-COVID 19, neuro-protective, nephro-protective, and fertility-enhancing properties. These potencies make it a more precious entity in the preventions as well as treatments of prevalent systematic diseases and/or disorders. Also, the review is acknowledging and documenting its powerful bioactivities in relation with the pharmaceutical as well as nutraceutical applicability.
