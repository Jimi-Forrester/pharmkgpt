38306361|a|Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and the GBM variant gliosarcoma (GS) are among the tumors with the highest morbidity and mortality, providing only palliation. Stem-like glioma cells (SLGCs) are involved in tumor initiation, progression, therapy resistance, and relapse. The identification of general features of SLGCs could contribute to the development of more efficient therapies. Commercially available protein arrays were used to determine the cell surface signature of eight SLGC lines from GBMs, one SLGC line obtained from a xenotransplanted GBM-derived SLGC line, and three SLGC lines from GSs. By means of non-negative matrix factorization expression metaprofiles were calculated. Using the cophenetic correlation coefficient (CCC) five metaprofiles (MPs) were identified, which are characterized by specific combinations of 7-12 factors. Furthermore, the expression of several factors, that are associated with GBM prognosis, GBM subtypes, SLGC differentiation stages, or neural identity was evaluated. The investigation encompassed 24 distinct SLGC lines, four of which were derived from xenotransplanted SLGCs, and included the SLGC lines characterized by the metaprofiles. It turned out that all SLGC lines expressed the epidermal growth factor EGFR and EGFR ligands, often in the presence of additional receptor tyrosine kinases. Moreover, all SLGC lines displayed a neural signature and the IDH1 wildtype, but differed in their p53 and PTEN status. Pearson Correlation analysis identified a positive association between the pluripotency factor Sox2 and the expression of FABP7, Musashi, CD133, GFAP, but not with MGMT or Hif1alpha. Spherical growth, however, was positively correlated with high levels of Hif1alpha, CDK4, PTEN, and PDGFRbeta, whereas correlations with stemness factors or MGMT (MGMT expression and promoter methylation) were low or missing. Factors highly expressed by all SLGC lines, irrespective of their degree of stemness and growth behavior, are Cathepsin-D, CD99, EMMPRIN/CD147, Intbeta1, the Galectins 3 and 3b, and N-Cadherin.
