39132326|t|TMS-derived short afferent inhibition discriminates cognitive status in older adults without dementia.
39132326|a|Aging is a complex and diverse biological process characterized by progressive molecular, cellular, and tissue damage, resulting in a loss of physiological integrity and heightened vulnerability to pathology. This biological diversity corresponds with highly variable cognitive trajectories, which are further confounded by genetic and environmental factors that influence the resilience of the aging brain. Given this complexity, there is a need for neurophysiological indicators that not only discern physiologic and pathologic aging but also closely align with cognitive trajectories. Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) may have utility in this regard as a non-invasive brain stimulation tool that can characterize features of cortical excitability. Particularly, as a proxy for central cholinergic function, short-afferent inhibition (SAI) dysfunction is robustly associated with cognitive deficits in the latter stages of Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementia (ADRD). In this study, we evaluated SAI in healthy young adults and older adults who, though absent clinical diagnoses, were algorithmically classified as cognitively normal (CN) or cognitively impaired (CI) according to the Jak/Bondi actuarial criteria. We report that SAI is preserved in the Old-CN cohort relative to the young adults, and SAI is significantly diminished in the Old-CI cohort relative to both young and CN older adults. Additionally, diminished SAI was significantly associated with impaired sustained attention and working memory. As a proxy measure for central cholinergic deficits, we discuss the potential value of SAI for discerning physiological and pathological aging.
