35410602|t|Strategies for Treatment of Disease-Associated Dementia Beyond Alzheimer's Disease: An Update.
35410602|a|Memory, cognition, dementia, and neurodegeneration are complexly interlinked processes with various mechanistic pathways, leading to a range of clinical outcomes. They are strongly associated with pathological conditions like Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, and stroke and are a growing concern for their timely diagnosis and management. Several cognitionenhancing interventions for management include non-pharmacological interventions like diet, exercise, and physical activity, while pharmacological interventions include medicinal agents, herbal agents, and nutritional supplements. This review critically analyzed and discussed the currently available agents under different drug development phases designed to target the molecular targets, including cholinergic receptor, glutamatergic system, GABAergic targets, glycine site, serotonergic targets, histamine receptors, etc. Understanding memory formation and pathways involved therein aids in opening the new gateways to treating cognitive disorders. However, clinical studies suggest that there is still a dearth of knowledge about the pathological mechanism involved in neurological conditions, making the dropouts of agents from the initial phases of the clinical trial. Hence, a better understanding of the disease biology, mode of drug action, and interlinked mechanistic pathways at a molecular level is required.
