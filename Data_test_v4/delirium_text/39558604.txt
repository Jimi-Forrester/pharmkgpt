39558604|a|Several studies indicate that the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has strong interactions with immune mechanisms within the brain, indicating a close association between inflammation in the central nervous system and the progression of neurodegeneration. Despite considerable progress in understanding the inflammatory aspects of AD, several of them remain unresolved. Pro-inflammatory cytokines and microglia are pivotal components in the inflammatory cascade. Among these, the role of interleukin-8 (IL-8) in neurodegeneration seems complex and multifaceted, involving inflammation, neurotoxicity, blood-brain barrier disruption, and oxidative stress, and is still poorly characterized. We conducted a review to describe the evidence of IL-8 involvement in AD. IL-8 is a cytokine known for its proinflammatory properties and typically produced by macrophages, predominantly functions as a chemotactic signal for attracting neutrophils to inflamed sites in the bloodstream. Interestingly, IL-8 is also present in the brain, where it is primarily released by microglia in response to inflammatory signals. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the structure, function, and regulatory mechanisms of IL-8 relevant to AD pathology.
