37894064|t|Multi-Omics Analysis Reveals Age-Related Microbial and Metabolite Alterations in Non-Human Primates.
37894064|a|Aging is a systemic physiological degenerative process, with alterations in gut microbiota and host metabolism. However, due to the interference of multiple confounding factors, aging-associated molecular characteristics have not been elucidated completely. Therefore, based on 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing and non-targeted metabolomic detection, our study systematically analyzed the composition and function of the gut microbiome, serum, and fecal metabolome of 36 male rhesus monkeys spanning from 3 to 26 years old, which completely covers juvenile, adult, and old stages. We observed significant correlations between 41 gut genera and age. Moreover, 86 fecal and 49 serum metabolites exhibited significant age-related correlations, primarily categorized into lipids and lipid-like molecules, organic oxygen compounds, organic acids and derivatives, and organoheterocyclic compounds. Further results suggested that aging is associated with significant downregulation of various amino acids constituting proteins, elevation of lipids, particularly saturated fatty acids, and steroids. Additionally, age-dependent changes were observed in multiple immune-regulatory molecules, antioxidant stress metabolites, and neurotransmitters. Notably, multiple age-dependent genera showed strong correlations in these changes. Together, our results provided new evidence for changing characteristics of gut microbes and host metabolism during aging. However, more research is needed in the future to verify our findings.
