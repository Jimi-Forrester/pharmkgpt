25420301|t|Hospitalwide initiative decreases readmissions, length-of-stay.
25420301|a|As part of its efforts to decrease readmissions, OSF Saint Francis Medical Center in Peoria, IL, developed a hospitalwide initiative to create safe transitions. The bedside RN assesses patients for risk of readmission, using Project BOOST guidelines, within four hours of admission, and the nurse on every shift repeats the assessment. The team on every shift assesses patients for delirium, and when patients test positive, initiates a series of interventions including a referral to a pharmacist to review medication and notifying the patient's physician. Nursing and case management use a discharge readiness report, a checklist of discharge needs, to make sure everything needed for the discharge is in place.
