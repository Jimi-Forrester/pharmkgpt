37349047|a|With the buildup of new research data, newer associations between anaerobic bacteria and diseases/conditions were evaluated. The aim of the mini-review was to draw attention and to encourage further multidisciplinary studies of the associations. We considered microbiome-disease correlations such as a decrease of fecal Faecalibacterium prausnitzii abundance in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and IBD recurrence, suggesting that F. prausnitzii could be a good biomarker for IBD. A link of subgingival Porphyromonas gingivalis with cardiovascular diseases was reported. Decreased Roseburia abundance was observed in the gut of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease patients. Akkermansia muciniphila was found to improve adipose/glucose metabolism, however, its intestinal abundance was observed in neurodegenerative diseases as well. Severe Clostridioides difficile infections have been reported in neonates and young children. Carcinogenic potential of anaerobes has been suggested. Fusobacterium nucleatum was implicated in the development of oral and colorectal cancer, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Tannerella forsythia were linked to esophageal cancer and Cutibacterium acnes subsp. defendens was associated with prostate cancer. However, there are some controversies about the results. In a Swedish longitudinal study, neither P. gingivalis nor T. forsythia exhibited oncogenic potential. The present data can enrich knowledge of anaerobic bacteria and their multifaceted significance for health and disease and can draw future research directions. However, more studies on large numbers of patients over prolonged periods are needed, taking into account the possible changes in the microbiota over time.
