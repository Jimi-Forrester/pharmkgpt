39695562|a|BACKGROUND: Delirium is a complex neuropsychiatric syndrome characterised by an acute state of confusion, with a substantial impact on medical inpatients. Despite its growing recognition as a global healthcare concern, delirium remains underdiagnosed, partly due to a lack of awareness among healthcare professionals. The aim of this study was to explore how healthcare professional students experience caring for individuals experiencing delirium, the influence of their current pre-registration healthcare education, and importance of interprofessional teamwork in their role. METHODS: This qualitative study used a focus group approach to collect data from 40 healthcare professional students, including nursing, pharmacy, and medical students, across two universities in Ireland. The focus groups explored participants' experiences of caring for people with delirium, their delirium education, and their collaboration with interdisciplinary teams. The data were analysed using a reflexive thematic analysis approach. RESULTS: Following thematic analysis, three themes are reported. The first is "The Upside Down," revealing student perceptions of caring for people with delirium who are facing distressing situations. The second team reported is, "Teamwork Makes the Dream Work," emphasising the critical role of interprofessional collaboration in delirium management and patient outcomes. Finally, the theme of "A Little Is Not Enough," highlighted students' critiques of current delirium education in their pre-registration training. Collectively, these themes illuminate challenges in delirium care, advocate for teamwork in healthcare settings, and call for improvements in educational preparation for future healthcare professionals. CONCLUSIONS: This study contributes to the existing literature by providing insights into the perspectives of healthcare professional students on delirium care. The findings also highlight the challenging nature of caring for individuals with delirium and the need for improved delirium education and interdisciplinary collaboration.
