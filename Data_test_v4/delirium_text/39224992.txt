39224992|a|OBJECTIVE: Catatonia is a syndrome that can be missed in clinical settings. Diagnosis of catatonia is important because the condition can be reversible and is associated with severe complications. This study aims to screen patients with catatonia admitted to a university hospital's psychiatry and neurology services, examine their characteristics, and compare the coverage of different catatonia scales. METHOD: During a consecutive 20 months study period, the Turkish adaptations of the Bush-Francis Catatonia Rating and the KANNER scales were administered in psychiatry and neurology inpatient units and patients on the waiting list for psychiatric hospitalization. The participants were also evaluated with DSM-5 criteria. In addition, the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of the patients in the psychiatric group were compared. RESULTS: A total of 214 patients were evaluated. Twenty-eight (13.1%) screened positive for catatonia, and 23 (82.1%) were diagnosed with catatonia according to DSM-5 criteria. KANNER and Bush- Francis identified the same patients as having catatonia. In addition to schizophrenia and mood disorders; neurodevelopmental disorder, encephalitis, postpartum psychosis, obsessive-compulsive disorder, delirium, cerebrovascular disease, functional neurological symptom disorder have also been found to be associated with catatonia. The most common complication was urinary tract infection. Life-threatening complications were also observed. CONCLUSION: Overlooking catatonia may have dire consequences. Adhering solely to the DSM-5 criteria may miss some patients with catatonia. Widely and efficiently using standardized catatonia scales can improve detection capacity and enhance the management of morbidity and mortality.
