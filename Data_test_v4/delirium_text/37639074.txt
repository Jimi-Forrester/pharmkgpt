37639074|a|BACKGROUND: Preventive measures addressing the exposome can counteract neurodegenerative diseases. OBJECTIVE: This article gives an overview on the influence of general and individual exogenous factors (environmental influences and lifestyle changes) as well as endogenous factors (e.g. metabolic alterations) on the development and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). METHODS: Summary and evaluation of current scientific studies and evidence regarding the exposome and prevention of AD and PD. RESULTS: Numerous studies could demonstrate a potential influence of environmental influences associated with industrialization (general exogenous factors), such as pesticides, solvents or air pollution on the development of AD and PD. Additionally, individually addressable changes of lifestyle (individual exogenous factors, e.g. physical activity, cognitive stimulation, nutrition and sleep) contribute to disease protection and modification and are becoming increasingly more important in light of still limited therapeutic interventions. Moreover, other exogenous factors (medication, noise pollution, head trauma and heavy metals) are discussed as risk factors for AD and/or PD. Endogenous factors (e.g., changes of the enteral microbiome, systemic inflammation and neuroinflammation, metabolic changes) can contribute to disease development by a higher potential for interacting with exogenous factors. CONCLUSION: Despite the comprehensive scientific evidence confirming the significance of the exposome for the pathogenesis of AD and PD, the great potential of preventive measures has not yet been exploited. A clarification of the high potential of lifestyle changes should be a therapeutic standard not only for individuals with manifest PD/AD but also for individuals with a risk profile or with suspected prodromal disease. Further investigations on the influence of environmental factors and the implementation of preventive strategies to avoid exposure should be the focus of international efforts.
