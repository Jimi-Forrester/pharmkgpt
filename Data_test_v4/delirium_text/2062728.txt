2062728|t|The treatment of cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease: beyond the cholinergic approach.
2062728|a|Despite the well-founded rationale for the use of cholinomimetic and monoaminergic agents in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, thus far, these strategies have only led to modest results. None of the drugs assessed to date have been shown to improve cognitive function to a clinically significant degree in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Some agents have produced mild improvements on specific tests, whereas others seem to slow down the progression of the disease. This article provides a brief overview of the current trends in the treatment of cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease.
