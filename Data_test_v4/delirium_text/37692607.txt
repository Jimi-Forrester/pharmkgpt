37692607|t|A Case of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy After Mitral Valvuloplasty.
37692607|a|We present a case of an 82-year-old male patient with a history of severe mitral regurgitation, severe aortic regurgitation, chronic atrial fibrillation, and suicide attempts due to depression. The patient underwent mitral valvuloplasty and aortic valve replacement for mitral valve regurgitation and aortic valve regurgitation. The patient was extubated on the morning of the sixth postoperative day, but he was reintubated in the evening because of hypotension and an unstable respiratory status. Echocardiography revealed Takotsubo cardiomyopathy development, and the patient was treated with intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) implantation, which was removed on postoperative day 11.
