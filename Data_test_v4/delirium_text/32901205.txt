32901205|t|Application of Phage-Displayed Peptides in Tumor Imaging Diagnosis and Targeting Therapy.
32901205|a|Phage display is an effective and powerful technique that provides a route to discovery unique peptides targeting to tumor cells. Specifically binding peptides are considered as the valuable target directing molecule fragments with potential efficiency to improve the current tumor clinic, and offer new approaches for tumor prevention, diagnosis and treatment. We focus on the recent advances in the isolation of tumor-targeting peptides by biopanning methods, with particular emphasis on molecular imaging, and pharmaceutical targeting therapy.
