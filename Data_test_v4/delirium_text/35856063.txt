35856063|a|Background: Low-grade inflammation has been implicated in the pathophysiology of severe mental disorders (SMDs) and a link between immune activation and clinical characteristics is suggested. However, few studies have investigated how patterns across immune markers are related to diagnosis and illness course. Methods: A total of 948 participants with a diagnosis of schizophrenia (SCZ, N = 602) or bipolar (BD, N = 346) spectrum disorder, and 814 healthy controls (HC) were included. Twenty-five immune markers comprising cell adhesion molecules (CAMs), interleukin (IL)-18-system factors, defensins, chemokines and other markers, related to neuroinflammation, blood-brain barrier (BBB) function, inflammasome activation and immune cell orchestration were analyzed. Eight immune principal component (PC) scores were constructed by PC Analysis (PCA) and applied in general linear models with diagnosis and illness course characteristics. Results: Three PC scores were significantly associated with a SCZ and/or BD diagnosis (HC reference), with largest, however small, effect sizes of scores based on CAMs, BBB markers and defensins (p < 0.001, partial eta2 = 0.02-0.03). Number of psychotic episodes per year in SCZ was associated with a PC score based on IL-18 system markers and the potential neuroprotective cytokine A proliferation-inducing ligand (p = 0.006, partial eta2 = 0.071). Conclusion: Analyses of composite immune markers scores identified specific patterns suggesting CAMs-mediated BBB dysregulation pathways associated with SMDs and interrelated pro-inflammatory and neuronal integrity processes associated with severity of illness course. This suggests a complex pattern of immune pathways involved in SMDs and SCZ illness course.
