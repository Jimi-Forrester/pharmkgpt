34948542|t|Causes and Treatment of Hypoxia during Total Hip Arthroplasty in Elderly Patients: A Case Report.
34948542|a|Intraoperative hypoxia occurs in approximately 6.8% of surgeries and requires appropriate management to avoid poor outcomes, such as increased mortality or extended hospitalization. Hypoxia can be caused by a variety of factors, including laryngospasm, inhalational anesthetics, and surgery for abdominal pathology or hip fractures. In particular, elderly patients are more vulnerable to hypoxia due to their existing lung diseases or respiratory muscle weakness. This study presents the cases of two elderly patients who developed hypoxia during total hip arthroplasty under general anesthesia. Positive end expiratory pressure, the recruitment maneuver, and increased fraction of inspired oxygen improved hypoxia only temporarily, and patients' oxygen saturation level again dropped to 79-80%. We suspected that hypoxia was caused by atelectasis and, therefore, resumed spontaneous respiration. Thereafter, both the patients showed an improvement in hypoxia. Intraoperative hypoxia that is suspected to be caused by atelectasis can be improved by securing sufficient lung volume for respiration through increased muscle tone with spontaneous respiration.
