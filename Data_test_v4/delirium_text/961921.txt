961921|a|Although there is evidence that the delirium, stupor, coma, and seizure-like activity seen in overdosage with tricyclic antidepressants and antiparkinson drugs are due to the central anticholinergic activity of these agents, patients with overdosage of these drugs are still frequently misdiagnosed. The authors present a case of reversal of anticholinergic-drug-induced prolonged coma, myoclonus, and choreoathetosis by physostigmine. This report supports the anticholinergic basis of the clinical manifestations of such overdosages, provides information on the role of acetylcholine and dopamine in psychiatric and movement disorders, and illustrates dramatically the need for accurate diagnosis and treatment.
