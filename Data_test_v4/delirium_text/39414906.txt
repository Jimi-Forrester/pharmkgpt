39414906|a|Maternal use of e-cigarette (e-cig) aerosols poses significant risks to fetal brain development, potentially increasing susceptibility to neurodevelopmental disorders in later life. However, the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. This study aimed to understand the effects of fetal e-cig exposure on DNA methylome and transcriptomic changes in the neonatal brain. Pregnant rats were exposed to e-cig aerosols, and neonatal brains (5 males and 5 females/group) from both control and e-cig-exposed groups were used for experimental analysis. Results indicated that prenatal e-cig exposure altered site-specific DNA methylation patterns at both CpG and CH (non-CpG) sites, predominantly in intergenic and intronic regions, with sex dimorphism in methylation and gene expression changes. Gene ontology analysis revealed that e-cig exposure not only affected neuron projection development and axonogenesis but also altered pathways related to neurodegeneration and long-term depression. These findings provide novel insights into the dynamic changes of CpG and CH methylation induced by e-cig exposure, underscoring the susceptibility of the developing brain to maternal e-cig exposure and its potential implications for developmental disorders and neurodegenerative diseases later in life.
