29233124|a|BACKGROUD: To evaluate the manifestations of increased esodeviation under cycloplegia with 0.5% tropicamide and 0.5% phenylephrine in children with hyperopia and esotropia. METHODS: We reviewed the medical record of 34 children with hyperopia and esotropia who underwent a prism alternate cover test before and after instillation of mixed eye drops containing 0.5% tropicamide and 0.5% phenylephrine between November 2014 and October 2015. Increased angle of deviation was defined as 10 prism diopters (PD) or greater deviation after cycloplegia. The factors related to increased angle of deviation were evaluated using univariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: The median age was 5.0 years (interquartile range, 3.75 to 5.0) and 12 patients (35.3%) were male. The median manifested refractive (MR) was +2.13 diopters (D) (+0.92 to +4.47) and cycloplegic refractive (CR) was +3.50 D (+1.72 to +5.66). The median difference between MR and CR was +0.88 D (+0.50 to +1.28). Thirteen patients (38.2%) showed increased esodeviation under cycloplegia and all had accommodative esotropia. A larger difference between MR and CR was the only significant factor affecting increased esodeviation in both univariable (OR = 4.72, P = 0.029) and multivariable (OR = 5.22, P = 0.047) analyses. CONCLUSION: Children with hyperopia and esotropia often showed an increased angle of deviation after instillation of 0.5% tropicamide and 0.5% phenylephrine. This phenomenon reminded the clinicians that cycloplegics can have a different effect on esodeviation and suggested that increased angle of esodeviation may help to reveal the latent deviation in some patients with hyperopia and esotropia.
