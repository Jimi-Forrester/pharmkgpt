27882091|a|beta-amyloid protein (Abeta) accumulation in cerebral centers involved in cognition and memory is a pivotal pathological feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The onset process of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has a number of similarities compared with AD. Thus, it is hypothesized that the pharmacological therapy employed for the treatment of T2DM may help to prevent and ameliorate the symptoms of AD. This study demonstrated that Exendin-4, which is a glucagon-like peptide-1 analogue which is used as a therapeutic drug for T2DM, markedly antagonized Abeta fragment-induced attenuation of spatial learning and memory ability, as indicated by a Morris water maze experiment. In addition, we investigated the potential underlying electrophysiological and molecular mechanisms. The results indicate that Exendin-4 rescued long-term potentiation from Abeta1-42-induced damage in the rat hippocampal CA1 region in vivo, and antagonized Abeta1-42-induced reduction of cyclic adenosine monophosphate and phosphorylated-cAMP response element-binding protein in rat hippocampal tissue using ELISA and western blot analysis, respectively. Thus, the results of the present study provide theoretical support for the application of Exendin-4 for improving AD.
