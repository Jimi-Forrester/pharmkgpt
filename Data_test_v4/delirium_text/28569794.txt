28569794|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disease. Although its pathogenesis remains unclear, mitochondrial dysfunction plays a vital role in the pathology of PD. P7C3, an aminopropyl carbazole, possesses a significant neuroprotective ability in several neurodegenerative disorders, including PD. Here, we showed that P7C3 stabilized mitochondrial membrane potential, reduced reactive oxygen species production, and inhibited cytochrome c release in MES23.5 cells (a dopaminergic (DA) cell line) exposed to 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+). In MES23.5 cells, P7C3 inhibited glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK3beta) activation induced by MPP+. P7C3 also inhibited p53 activity and repressed Bax upregulation to protect cells from MPP+ toxicity. In addition, the activation of p53 was significantly attenuated with the inhibition of GSK3beta activity by P7C3. Furthermore, P7C3 blocked GSK3beta and p53 activation in the midbrain, and prevented DA neuronal loss in the substantia nigra in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydropyridine mice. Thus, our study demonstrates that P7C3 protects DA neurons from neurotoxin-induced cell death by repressing the GSK3beta-p53-Bax pathway both in vitro and in vivo, thus providing a theoretical basis for P7C3 in the potential clinical treatment of PD.
