34500036|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that causes memory and cognitive decline. Although many studies have attempted to clarify the causes of AD occurrence, it is not clearly understood. Recently, the emerging role of the gut microbiota in neurodegenerative diseases, including AD, has received much attention. The gut microbiota composition of AD patients and AD mouse models is different from that of healthy controls, and these changes may affect the brain environment. However, the specific mechanisms by which gut microbiota that influence memory decline are currently unclear. In this study, we performed fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) to clarify the role of 5xFAD mouse-derived microbiota in memory decline. We observed that FMT from 5xFAD mice into normal C57BL/6 mice (5xFAD-FMT) decreased adult hippocampal neurogenesis and brain-derived neurotrophic factor expression and increased p21 expression, resulting in memory impairment. Microglia in the hippocampus of the 5xFAD-FMT mice were activated, which caused the elevation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1beta). Moreover, we observed that pro-inflammatory cytokines increased in the colon and plasma of 5xFAD-FMT mice. The gut microbiota composition of the 5xFAD-FMT mice was different from that of the control mice or wild type-FMT mice. Collectively, 5xFAD mouse-derived microbiota decreased neurogenesis by increasing colonic inflammation, thereby contributing to memory loss. Our findings provide further evidence concerning the role of gut microbial dysbiosis in AD pathogenesis and suggest that targeting the gut microbiota may be a useful therapeutic strategy for the development of novel candidates for the treatment of AD.
