34903970|a|Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) management in patients with predisposing psychiatric disorders would be challenging due to potential drug-drug interactions (PDDIs) and precipitation of their disease severity. Furthermore, COVID-19 itself might precipitate or induce unpredicted psychiatry and neuropsychiatry complications in these patients. In this literature review study, the psychological impacts of COVID-19 and major psychiatric adverse drug reactions (ADRs) of COVID-19 treatment options have been discussed. A detailed Table has been provided to assess potential drug-drug interactions of COVID-19 treatment options with psychotropic medications to avoid unwanted major drug-drug interactions. Finally, potential mechanisms of these major drug-drug interactions and possible management of them have been summarized. The most common type of major PDDIs is pharmacokinetics. Hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir were the most involved anti-COVID-19 agents in these major PDDIs.
