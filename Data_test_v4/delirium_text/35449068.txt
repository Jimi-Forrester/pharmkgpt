35449068|t|Challenging the dogma to "always operate" acute hip fractures: a proof-of-concept pilot study for nonoperative management of undisplaced femoral neck fractures.
35449068|a|BACKGROUND: The notion that all acute hip fractures are a surgical entity requiring either surgical fracture fixation or hip replacement represents a historic dogma, particularly within the orthopaedic community of the United States. The present study from a European regional trauma center was designed to challenge the notion that stable and undisplaced femoral neck fractures represent an absolute indication for surgical management. METHODS: The purpose of this study was to investigate the hypothesis that stable and undisplaced femoral neck fractures of the Garden types 1 and 2 can be safely managed nonoperatively. A retrospective observational cohort study was carried out at a regional orthopaedic trauma center in Germany from January 1, 2016 to June 30, 2021. The inclusion criteria specified patients older than 18 years suffering a < 24 h, traumatic, femoral neck fracture Garden types 1 and 2. Exclusion criteria included Garden types 3 and 4 femoral neck fractures, pregnancy, active infection or previous surgery, tumor-associated fractures, medical history of femoral neck necrosis, vascular injury associated with femoral neck fractures, nerve injury associated to a femoral neck fracture and >= 24 h femoral neck fracture. The primary intention of this research was to identify deterioration of fracture retention with an ensuing unplanned trip to the operating room in femoral neck fractures Garden types 1 and 2. Secondary were included unplanned readmissions and complications such as surgical site infection. RESULTS: A total of 41 undisplaced femoral neck fractures (Garden types 1 and 2) were included in this study; n = 20 were in the resulting admission operatively treated (group 1) and n = 21 were treated conservatively. The mean age in group 1 was 76 years; women (70%). In group 2 it was 81 years with a female dominance (71.4%). Admission status: Garden types 1 and 2, group 1 n = 13/7 and group 2 n = 15/6. Subsequent femoral neck fracture displacement (Y/N) (in case of operation, before operation) group 1 n = 14/6 and group 2 n = 6/15. CONCLUSION: According with our results, patients sustaining Garden type 1 femoral neck fractures, depending on age and comorbidities, should be treated conservatively with weight bearing and under physiotherapeutic instructions. In case of femoral neck fractures Garden type 2, a surgical treatment should be performed in order to avoid femoral neck fractures to slip after weight bearing by lacking of fracture impaction.
