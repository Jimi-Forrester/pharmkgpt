37054760|t|3-Arylidene-2-oxindoles as GSK3beta inhibitors and anti-thrombotic agents.
37054760|a|Development of novel agents that prevent thrombotic events is an urgent task considering increasing incidence of cardiovascular diseases and coagulopathies that accompany cancer and COVID-19. Enzymatic assay identified novel GSK3beta inhibitors in a series of 3-arylidene-2-oxindole derivatives. Considering the putative role of GSK3beta in platelet activation, the most active compounds were evaluated for antiplatelet activity and antithrombotic activity. It was found that GSK3beta inhibition by 2-oxindoles correlates with inhibition of platelet activation only for compounds 1b and 5a. Albeit, in vitro antiplatelet activity matched well with in vivo anti-thrombosis activity. The most active GSK3beta inhibitor 5a exceeds antiplatelet activity of acetylsalicylic acid in vitro by 10.3 times and antithrombotic activity in vivo by 18.7 times (ED50 7.3 mg/kg). These results support the promising role of GSK3beta inhibitors for development of novel antithrombotic agents.
