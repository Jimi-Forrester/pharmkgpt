32205689|t|Incidental Durotomy Is Associated With Increased Risk of Delirium in Patients Aged 65 and Older.
32205689|a|STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of incidental durotomy during spine surgery on the development of delirium in patients aged 65 and older. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Delirium after spine surgery has been shown to increase the risk of adverse events, including morbidity and readmissions. Durotomy has previously been postulated to influence the risk of delirium, but this has not been explored in patients 65 and older, the demographic at greatest risk of developing delirium. METHODS: We obtained clinical data on 766 patients, including 182 with incidental durotomy, from the Partners healthcare registry (2012-2019). Patients had their medical records abstracted and age, biologic sex, body mass index, smoking status, preoperative diagnosis, use of a fusion-based procedure, and number of comorbidities were recorded. Our primary outcome was the development of delirium. Our primary predictor was incidental durotomy. We used logistic regression techniques to adjust for sociodemographic and clinical confounders. We performed propensity score matching as a sensitivity test. We hypothesized that elderly patients would be at increased risk of delirium following durotomy. RESULTS: Delirium was identified in 142 patients (19%). Among patients with an incidental durotomy, 26% were diagnosed with delirium. The incidence of delirium was 16% in the control group. Following adjusted analysis, the likelihood of delirium was significantly greater in patients with a durotomy (odds ratio [OR] 1.91; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.27, 2.88). After propensity score matching, durotomy remained significantly associated with delirium in multivariable adjusted analyses (OR 1.90; 95% CI 1.07, 3.39). CONCLUSION: This investigation is among the first to specifically evaluate an association between durotomy and delirium in elderly patients undergoing spine surgery. The increased association between durotomy and delirium in this cohort should prompt increased surveillance and interventions designed to minimize the potential for cognitive deterioration or impairment during postoperative management of a durotomy.
