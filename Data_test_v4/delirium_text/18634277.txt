18634277|t|[Delirium--not only psychiatric issue].
18634277|a|Delirium presents as a diagnosis joining closely other medical disciplines. Because of its serious prognosis, precise causal diagnostic is required. Selective therapy, to avoid serious prognosis, is possible when delirium is early diagnosed and ethiology is established. The present work is to remind risk factors of delirium, to explain mechanisms responsible for development of delirium based on various etiology, show biomarkers helpful in making diagnosis, and pay special attention to prodromal symptoms and clinical forms.
