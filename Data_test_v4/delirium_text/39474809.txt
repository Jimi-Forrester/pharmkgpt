39474809|t|Preparation and Characterization of Poly(ethylene oxide)-b-poly(tert-butyl methacrylate) Micelles as Potential Nanocarriers for Donepezil.
39474809|a|Polymeric micelles were prepared for the delivery of donepezil, a leading Alzheimer's disease (AD) drug, to enhance its transport across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(tert-butyl methacrylate) amphiphilic block copolymers were synthesized via reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization. The polymers were characterized by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Empty and donepezil loaded polymer micelles were formed using the dialysis method and characterized by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Drug loading efficiency and release behavior were monitored using UV/Vis spectroscopy, and cytotoxicity was evaluated via colorimetric tests and impedance measurements. Additionally, the permeability of the nanocarriers across an in vitro BBB culture model was assessed. Drug-loaded micelles demonstrated similar permeability to free donepezil but offered sustained release and improved stability. This micellar delivery system holds significant potential for improving therapeutic outcomes in Alzheimer's treatment by enhancing donepezil's delivery across the BBB. Improved BBB permeability and sustained drug release could lead to more effective concentration of the drug in the brain, potentially reducing peripheral cholinergic side effects, such as nausea and vomiting, often observed with traditional donepezil administration. This could result in better patient compliance and improved cognitive outcomes, making this nanocarrier system a promising alternative for Alzheimer's therapy.
