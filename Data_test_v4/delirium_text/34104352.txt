34104352|a|Background: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a frequently observed stress-related disorder after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and it is characterized by numerous symptoms, such as flashbacks, intrusions and anxiety, as well as uncontrollable thoughts and feelings related to the trauma. Biological correlates of severe stress might contribute to identifying PTSD-vulnerable patients at an early stage. Objective: Aims of the study were (1) to determine whether blood levels of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) vary immediately after AMI in patients with/without AMI-induced PTSD symptomatology, (2) to investigate whether TMAO is a potential biomarker that might be useful in the prediction of PTSD and the PTSD symptom subclusters re-experiencing, avoidance and hyperarousal, and (3) to investigate whether TMAO varies immediately after AMI in patients with/without depression 6 months after AMI. Method: A total of 114 AMI patients were assessed with the Hamilton-Depression Scale after admission to the hospital and 6 months later. The Clinician Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 was used to explore PTSD-symptoms at the time of AMI and 6 months after AMI. To assess patients' TMAO status, serum samples were collected at hospitalization and 6 months after AMI. Results: Participants with PTSD-symptomatology had significantly higher TMAO levels immediately after AMI than patients without PTSD-symptoms (ANCOVA: TMAO(PTSD x time), F = 4.544, df = 1, p = 0.035). With the inclusion of additional clinical predictors in a hierarchical logistic regression model, TMAO became a significant predictor of PTSD-symptomatology. No significant differences in TMAO levels immediately after AMI were detected between individuals with/without depression 6 months after AMI. Conclusions: An elevated TMAO level immediately after AMI might reflect severe stress in PTSD-vulnerable patients, which might also lead to a short-term increase in gut permeability to trimethylamine, the precursor of TMAO. Thus, an elevated TMAO level might be a biological correlate for severe stress that is associated with vulnerability to PTSD.
