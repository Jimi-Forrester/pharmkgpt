10084344|a|OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of delirium, as a comorbid diagnosis in hospitalised patients, on patient length of stay (LOS). METHOD: Prospective study comparing LOS of delirious patients with controls matched by age, gender, principal diagnosis and date of admission. Medical and surgical inpatients of Westmead Hospital with delirium were identified from a Consultation Liaison (CL) psychiatry database and were matched with controls from the hospital medical records. RESULTS: Delirious patient LOS was found to be significantly longer (2.2-fold; 95% confidence interval 1.5-3.3) than matched controls. CONCLUSIONS: Delirium, as a comorbid diagnosis in general hospital patients, is associated with an increased use of resources. Its early diagnosis may limit this and morbidity.
