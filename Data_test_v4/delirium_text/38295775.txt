38295775|t|Sex and Socioeconomic Disparities in Dementia Risk: A Population Attributable Fractions Analysis in Argentina.
38295775|a|INTRODUCTION, twelve modifiable risk factors (RF) account for 40% of dementia cases worldwide. However, limited data exists on such factors in middle- and low-income countries. We aimed to estimate the population-attributable fractions (PAFs) for the 12 RF in Argentina, assessing changes over a decade, and exploring socioeconomic and sex influences. METHODS, we conducted cross-sectional analyses of the 12 RF from Argentinian surveys conducted in 2009, 2015, and 2018, including 96,321 people. We calculated PAFs, and stratified estimates based on sex and income. RESULTS, we estimated an overall PAF of 59.6%(95%CI=58.9%-60.3%). The largest PAFs were hypertension=9.3%(8.7%-9.9%), physical inactivity=7.4%(6.8%-8.2%), and obesity=7.4%(6.8%-7.9%). Men were more impacted by excessive alcohol, while women by isolation and smoking. Lower income linked to higher PAFs in education, hypertension, and obesity. DISCUSSION, Argentina has a higher PAF for dementia than the world population, with distinct RF distribution. PAF varied by sex and economic status, advocating tailored prevention strategies.
