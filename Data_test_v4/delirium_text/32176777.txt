32176777|a|There is both clinical and neuroanatomical variability at the single-subject level in Alzheimer's disease, complicating our understanding of brain-behaviour relationships and making it challenging to develop neuroimaging biomarkers to track disease severity, progression, and response to treatment. Prior work has shown that both group-level atrophy in clinical dementia syndromes and complex neurological symptoms in patients with focal brain lesions localize to brain networks. Here, we use a new technique termed 'atrophy network mapping' to test the hypothesis that single-subject atrophy maps in patients with a clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease will also localize to syndrome-specific and symptom-specific brain networks. First, we defined single-subject atrophy maps by comparing cortical thickness in each Alzheimer's disease patient versus a group of age-matched, cognitively normal subjects across two independent datasets (total Alzheimer's disease patients = 330). No more than 42% of Alzheimer's disease patients had atrophy at any given location across these datasets. Next, we determined the network of brain regions functionally connected to each Alzheimer's disease patient's location of atrophy using seed-based functional connectivity in a large (n = 1000) normative connectome. Despite the heterogeneity of atrophied regions at the single-subject level, we found that 100% of patients with a clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease had atrophy functionally connected to the same brain regions in the mesial temporal lobe, precuneus cortex, and angular gyrus. Results were specific versus control subjects and replicated across two independent datasets. Finally, we used atrophy network mapping to define symptom-specific networks for impaired memory and delusions, finding that our results matched symptom networks derived from patients with focal brain lesions. Our study supports atrophy network mapping as a method to localize clinical, cognitive, and neuropsychiatric symptoms to brain networks, providing insight into brain-behaviour relationships in patients with dementia.
