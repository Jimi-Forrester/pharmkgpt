37939659|a|Substantial divergence in cardio-metabolic risk, muscle size, and performance exists between men and women. Considering the pivotal role of skeletal muscle in human physiology, we investigated and found, based on RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), that differences in the muscle transcriptome between men and women are largely related to testosterone and estradiol and much less related to genes located on the Y chromosome. We demonstrate inherent unique, sex-dependent differences in muscle transcriptional responses to aerobic, resistance, and combined exercise training in young and older cohorts. The hormonal changes with age likely explain age-related differential expression of transcripts. Furthermore, in primary human myotubes we demonstrate the profound but distinct effects of testosterone and estradiol on amino acid incorporation to multiple individual proteins with specific functions. These results clearly highlight the potential of designing exercise programs tailored specifically to men and women and have implications for people who change gender by altering their hormone profile.
