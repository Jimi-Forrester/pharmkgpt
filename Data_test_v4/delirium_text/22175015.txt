22175015|t|New Insights into the p38gamma and p38delta MAPK Pathways.
22175015|a|The mammalian p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) family is composed of four members (p38alpha, p38beta, p38gamma, and p38delta), which are very similar in amino acid sequence but differ in their expression patterns. This suggests that they may have specific functions in different organs. In the last years most of the effort has been centred on the study of the function of the p38alpha isoform, which is widely referred to as p38 in the literature. However, the role that other p38 isoforms play in cellular functions and their implication in some of the pathological conditions have not been precisely defined so far. In this paper we highlight recent advances made in defining the functions of the two less studied alternative p38MAPKs, p38gamma and p38delta. We describe that these p38MAPKs show similarities to the classical p38alpha isoform, although they may play central and distinct role in certain physiological and pathological processes.
