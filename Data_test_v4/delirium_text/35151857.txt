35151857|t|Natural isoquinoline alkaloids: Pharmacological features and multi-target potential for complex diseases.
35151857|a|Complex diseases such as neurodegenerative disorders and cancer constitute a growing public health problem due to the rising incidence and lack in effective therapies. Since pharmacotherapy based on a single target has been insufficient for drug development in complex diseases, the emerging multi-target approach is a promising strategy for the search of new drug candidates. Plant-derived isoquinoline alkaloids comprise a vast source of multimodal agents with unique structural diversity, and variated range of pharmacological activities. This review offers an exhaustive compilation of the pharmacological relevance and multi-target potential of natural isoquinolines, emphasizing their features and promising activity in complex diseases such as Alzheimer, Parkinson, and Cancer. Selected examples were discussed in depth to illustrate the most relevant structural motifs and their possible relationship with the multimodal activity offering a comprehensive baseline in the search and optimization of isoquinoline scaffolds with polypharmacological potential for complex diseases.
