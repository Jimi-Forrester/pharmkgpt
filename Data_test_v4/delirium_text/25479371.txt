25479371|a|BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown that the expression level of gamma-synuclein (SNCG) is associated with progression of many different malignant tumors. In this study, we discuss and assess the prognostic ability of SNCG in bladder cancer. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Medical records (2005-2013) were retrospectively reviewed for the population of interest. SNCG expression was identified immunohistochemically from bladder cancer tissues of 113 bladder cancer patients. The survival rate was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Cox proportional hazard regression model was used for analysis of predictors of bladder cancer. RESULTS: SNCG was overexpressed in bladder cancer tissues compared with the normal bladder tissues (p<0.0001). SNCG expression in bladder cancer tissue was strongly related to tumor stage. However, SNCG level was not a prognostic factor of survival. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that SNCG is highly expressed in bladder cancer tissue and its expression is stage-specific, but it is not helpful for predicting outcome in bladder cancer patients.
