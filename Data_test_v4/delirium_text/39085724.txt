39085724|a|PURPOSE: The importance of maintaining good mental health with overall well-being has recently drawn attention from various fields. Functional peptides found from various protein sources reportedly reduce mental health problems. We found a new decapeptide (AJI-801) from whey proteins, which can possibly improve mood status and increase blood acetyl-L-carnitine (ALC) and fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) levels. In this study, we assessed the effects of a single intake of whey protein hydrolysate containing a high amount of AJI-801 (WPH) on blood variables and mood status. METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over trial of two doses of WPH (100 and 500 mg) was conducted. Participants, aged between 20 and 59 years with fatigue were allocated to two groups based on the WPH doses received, and set first test food in each study. The blood ALC and FGF21 levels at baseline and after 60, 120, and 180 min of test food intake were analyzed and the responses to the questionnaire items for mood status were obtained at baseline and after 60 and 180 min of test food intake. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the blood ALC and FGF21 levels between the two groups. As mood status, intake of 500-mg WPH (including 2.5-mg AJI-801) showed significant improvement in Depression/Dejection of the Profile of Mood States Questionnaire second edition and visual analog scale score for depression, as compared to the placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Intake of AJI-801 500-mg WPH (including 2.5-mg AJI-801) contributes to the improvement of feeling down in healthy persons with fatigue.
