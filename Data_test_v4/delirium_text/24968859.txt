24968859|a|BACKGROUND: Cistanche tubulosa (Schenk) R. Wight (CT) is commonly used to treat forgetfulness by traditional Chinese physicians. This study presents the ameliorating effects of CT extract which was quantified with three phenylpropanoid glycosides in Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like rat model. METHODS: Amyloid beta peptide 1-42 (Abeta 1-42) intracisternally infused to rats by osmotic pump (Alzet 2002) was used as an AD-like rat model. The major pathological makers were measured including Abeta 1-42 immunohistochemical stain, behavioral tests (inhibitory avoidance task and Morris water maze) and central neurotransmitter functions. RESULTS: Abeta 1-42 caused the cognitive deficits, the increase in the amyloid deposition and acetylcholinesterase activities, and the decrease in the levels of brain's acetylcholine and dopamine. Daily administration of CT extract throughout Abeta 1-42 infusion periods ameliorated the cognitive deficits, decreased amyloid deposition and reversed cholinergic and hippocampal dopaminergic dysfunction caused by Abeta 1-42. Donepezil also ameliorated the cognitive dysfunction, but only blocked the amyloid deposition and cholinergic dysfunction caused by Abeta 1-42. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that CT extract, containing enough echinacoside and acteoside, ameliorated the cognitive dysfunction caused by Abeta 1-42 via blocking amyloid deposition, reversing cholinergic and hippocampal dopaminergic neuronal function.
