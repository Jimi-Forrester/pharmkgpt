38448300|a|BACKGROUND: Periodontitis is a chronic progressive disease and the leading cause of tooth loss in adults. Recent studies have shown the impact of oral microbial communities on systemic health and diseases such as cancer, atherosclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes, hypertension, and Alzheimer's disease. In previous case control studies investigatin the relationship between periodontal disease and the oral microbiota, little attention has been paid to the intersections of these domains. METHODS: Here, we used high-throughput 16S rRNA sequencing to analyse the differences in the microbial composition in saliva between a group of patients with chronic periodontitis (C; n = 51) and a healthy control group (H; n = 61) and predicted the functional gene composition by Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States. RESULTS: We found significant alterations in oral microbial diversity between C and H (P = 0.002). Sixteen genera were significantly different between C and H, and 15 of them were enriched in C linear discriminant analysis (LDA > 2). Fifty functional genes were significantly different between C and H, and 34 of them were enriched in C (P < .025). CONCLUSIONS: Periodontitis is associated with significant changes in the oral microbial community.
