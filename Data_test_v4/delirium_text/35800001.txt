35800001|t|Khaya grandifoliola active fraction as a source of therapeutic compounds for Alzheimer's disease treatment: In silico validation of identified compounds.
35800001|a|Overproduction of Nitric oxide (NO) and many other pro-inflammatory mediators are responsible for many pathological disorders in humans, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, active fractions isolated from Khaya grandifoliola (Kg) were screened for their inhibitory activities against NO production in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated microglia. Among the 5 fractions tested, Kg25 was the most active and showed potent inhibitory activity towards NO production. The fraction further showed inhibitory effect on iNOS's mRNA expression and other major pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNFalpha and IL1-beta. Study of the effect of Kg25 on p38MAPKinase and JNK3 showed that the fraction inhibits these signaling pathways known to be involved in cell inflammatory pathways. These observations were confirmed at the protein level with Kg25 inhibiting iNOS and p38MAPK protein expressions in N9 cells. Analysis of Kg25 composition by HPLC identified 3 main compounds, namely: 6 phenyl, 4-(1`oxyehylphenyl) hexane, Carbamic acid, (4-methly-1-phenyl)-1, phenyl, and Benzene, 1 1`-(oxydiethylidene) bis. The above mentionned compounds were further analyzed for their bioactivity against the p38MAPKinase and iNOS receptors using molecular docking. MolDock results showed that 1-phenylethyl N-(4-methylphenyl)carbamate (compound 2) possesses the highest binding affinity (for iNOS); and 1-(1-phenylethoxy)ethylbenzene (compound 3) (for pMAPK) respectively and both compounds interact well with the active site residues. Hence, these compounds could be considered as scaffolds for further development of lead- drugs targeting neuroinflammation in AD.
