38068991|t|Biofilms in Periprosthetic Orthopedic Infections Seen through the Eyes of Neutrophils: How Can We Help Neutrophils?
38068991|a|Despite advancements in our knowledge of neutrophil responses to planktonic bacteria during acute inflammation, much remains to be elucidated on how neutrophils deal with bacterial biofilms in implant infections. Further complexity transpires from the emerging findings on the role that biomaterials play in conditioning bacterial adhesion, the variety of biofilm matrices, and the insidious measures that biofilm bacteria devise against neutrophils. Thus, grasping the entirety of neutrophil-biofilm interactions occurring in periprosthetic tissues is a difficult goal. The bactericidal weapons of neutrophils consist of the following: ready-to-use antibacterial proteins and enzymes stored in granules; NADPH oxidase-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS); and net-like structures of DNA, histones, and granule proteins, which neutrophils extrude to extracellularly trap pathogens (the so-called NETs: an allusive acronym for "neutrophil extracellular traps"). Neutrophils are bactericidal (and therefore defensive) cells endowed with a rich offensive armamentarium through which, if frustrated in their attempts to engulf and phagocytose biofilms, they can trigger the destruction of periprosthetic bone. This study speculates on how neutrophils interact with biofilms in the dramatic scenario of implant infections, also considering the implications of this interaction in view of the design of new therapeutic strategies and functionalized biomaterials, to help neutrophils in their arduous task of managing biofilms.
