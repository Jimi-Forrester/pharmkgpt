39863320|a|BACKGROUND: Cognitive training (CT) has been one of the important non-pharmaceutical interventions that could delay cognitive decline. Currently, no definite CT methods are available. Furthermore, little attention has been paid to the effect of CT on mood and instrumental activities of daily living (IADL). OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of a multicomponent CT using a training program of executive functions, attention, memory and visuospatial functions (TEAM-V Program) on cognition, mood and instrumental ADL. DESIGN: A randomized, single-blinded, treatment-as-usual controlled trial. SETTING: Geriatric clinic in Bangkok, Thailand. PARTICIPANTS: 80 nondemented community-dwelling older adults (mean age 65.7 +- 4.3 years). INTERVENTION: The CT (TEAM-V) Program or the treatment-as-usual controlled group. The TEAM-V intervention was conducted over 5 sessions, with a 2-week interval between each session. A total of 80 participants were randomized (n = 40 the TEAM-V Program; n = 40 the control group). MEASUREMENTS: The Thai version of Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), The Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-cog), Thai version of Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and The Chula ADL were used to assess at baseline, 6 months, 1 year and 2 years. RESULTS: Compared with the control arm (n = 36), the TEAM-V Program (n = 39) was associated with significantly improved general cognition (MoCA, P = 0.02) at 2 years. Compared with baseline, participants receiving the TEAM-V Program were associated with significantly improved immediate recall (word recall task, P < 0.001), retrieval and retention of memory processes (word recognition task, P = 0.01) and attention (number cancellation part A, P = 0.01) at 2 years. No training effects on anxiety (P = 0.94), depression (P = 0.093) and IADL (P = 0.48) were detected. CONCLUSIONS: The TEAM-V Program was effective in improving global cognitive function. Even though, the program did not significantly improve anxiety, depression and IADL compared with the control group, memory and attention improved in the intervention group compared with baseline. Further studies incorporating a larger sample size, longitudinal follow-up and higher-intensity CT should be conducted.
