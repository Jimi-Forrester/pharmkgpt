28970886|a|The aggregation into amyloid fibrils of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. A variety of Abeta peptides have been discovered in vivo, with pyroglutamate-modified Abeta (pEAbeta) forming a significant proportion. pEAbeta is mainly localized in the core of plaques, suggesting a possible role in inducing and facilitating Abeta oligomerization and accumulation. Despite this potential importance, the aggregation mechanism of pEAbeta and its influence on the aggregation kinetics of other Abeta variants have not yet been elucidated. Here we show that pEAbeta(3-42) forms fibrils much faster than Abeta(1-42) and the critical concentration above which aggregation was observed was drastically decreased by one order of magnitude compared to Abeta(1-42). We elucidated the co-aggregation mechanism of Abeta(1-42) with pEAbeta(3-42). At concentrations at which both species do not aggregate as homofibrils, mixtures of pEAbeta(3-42) and Abeta(1-42) aggregate, suggesting the formation of mixed nuclei. We show that the presence of pEAbeta(3-42) monomers increases the rate of primary nucleation of Abeta(1-42) and that fibrils of pEAbeta(3-42) serve as highly efficient templates for elongation and catalytic surfaces for secondary nucleation of Abeta(1-42). On the other hand, the addition of Abeta(1-42) monomers drastically decelerates the primary and secondary nucleation of pEAbeta(3-42) while not altering the pEAbeta(3-42) elongation rate. In addition, even moderate concentrations of fibrillar Abeta(1-42) prevent pEAbeta(3-42) aggregation, likely due to non-reactive binding of pEAbeta(3-42) monomers to the surfaces of Abeta(1-42) fibrils. Thus, pEAbeta(3-42) accelerates aggregation of Abeta(1-42) by affecting all individual reaction steps of the aggregation process while Abeta(1-42) dramatically slows down the primary and secondary nucleation of pEAbeta(3-42).
