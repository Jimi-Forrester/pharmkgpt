38223829|a|Background: Lung inflammation occurs in many lung diseases, but has limited effective therapeutics. Ginseng and its derivatives have anti-inflammatory effects, but their unstable physicochemical and metabolic properties hinder their application in the treatment. Panaxadiol (PD) is a stable saponin among ginsenosides. Inhalation administration may solve these issues, and the specific mechanism of action needs to be studied. Methods: A mouse model of lung inflammation induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), an in vitro macrophage inflammation model, and a coculture model of epithelial cells and macrophages were used to study the effects and mechanisms of inhalation delivery of PD. Pathology and molecular assessments were used to evaluate efficacy. Transcriptome sequencing was used to screen the mechanism and target. Finally, the efficacy and mechanism were verified in a human BALF cell model. Results: Inhaled PD reduced LPS-induced lung inflammation in mice in a dose-dependent manner, including inflammatory cell infiltration, lung tissue pathology, and inflammatory factor expression. Meanwhile, the dose of inhalation was much lower than that of intragastric administration under the same therapeutic effect, which may be related to its higher bioavailability and superior pharmacokinetic parameters. Using transcriptome analysis and verification by a coculture model of macrophage and epithelial cells, we found that PD may act by inhibiting TNFA/TNFAR and IL7/IL7R signaling to reduce macrophage inflammatory factor-induced epithelial apoptosis and promote proliferation. Conclusion: PD inhalation alleviates lung inflammation and pathology by inhibiting TNFA/TNFAR and IL7/IL7R signaling between macrophages and epithelial cells. PD may be a novel drug for the clinical treatment of lung inflammation.
