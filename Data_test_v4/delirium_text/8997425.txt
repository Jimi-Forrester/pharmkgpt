8997425|t|The neurochemistry of Alzheimer's disease.
8997425|a|The last 15-20 years have seen a wealth of studies to characterize the neurochemical abnormalities of Alzheimer's disease, in particular those involving the beta-amyloid and tau proteins, as well as more recently, apolipoprotein E4. This article provides a summary of the evidence for the involvement of these proteins in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis based on postmortem brain and CSF studies.
