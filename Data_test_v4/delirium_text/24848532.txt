24848532|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Possible mechanisms in cellular senescence and the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) that drive and promote chronic inflammation in multiple age-related chronic diseases are considered. RECENT FINDINGS: A series of studies about the SASP indicate that senescent cells may be involved in the development of chronic inflammatory diseases associated with aging. SUMMARY: Aging is a complex biological process accompanied by a state of chronic, low-grade, 'sterile' inflammation, which is a major contributor to the development of many age-related chronic disorders including atherosclerosis, osteoarthritis, Alzheimer's disease, type 2 diabetes, cancers, and others. It appears that cellular senescence plays a role in causing inflammation through the SASP. A better understanding of the contribution of senescent cells to the pathologies of chronic inflammatory disorders could have potentially profound diagnostic and therapeutic implications.
