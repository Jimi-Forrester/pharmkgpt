38421333|a|STUDY DESIGN: Systematic literature review. OBJECTIVES: To analyze the evidence available reporting complications in single or two-level anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) using a demineralized bone matrix (DBM), hydroxyapatite (HA), or beta-tricalcium phosphate (beta-TCP). METHODS: A systematic review of the literature using PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases was performed in August 2020 to identify studies reporting complications in one or two-level ACDF surgery using DBM, HA, or beta-TCP. The study was reported following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. RESULTS: A total of 1857 patients were included, 981 male and 876 female, across 17 articles; 5 prospective, and 12 retrospectives. We noted heterogeneity among the included studies concerning the study design and combination of graft materials utilized in them. However, we noted a higher incidence of adjacent segment disease (17.7%) and pseudoarthrosis (9.3%) in fusion constructs using DBM. Studies using beta-TCP reported a higher incidence of pseudoarthrosis (28.2%) and implant failures (17.9%). CONCLUSIONS: Degenerative cervical conditions treated with one or two-level ACDF surgery using DBM, HA, or beta-TCP with or without cervical plating are associated with complications such as adjacent segment disease, dysphagia, and pseudarthrosis. However, consequent to the study designs and clinical heterogeneity of the studies, it is not possible to correlate these complications accurately with any specific graft material employed. Further well-designed prospective studies are needed to correctly know the related morbidity of each graft used for achieving fusion in ACDF.
