31498123|a|We aimed to study the expression of circulating heat-shock protein HSP70 and exosomes in plasma of a cohort of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) at different stages. We performed correlations with clinical scales and FDG-PET. HSP70 levels were higher within exosomes than free in plasma. Moderate correlations were found between exosomal HSP70 and CDR, FTLD-CDR, and extension of hypometabolism. Our results suggest modifications in the level of exosomal HSP70 during the course of neurodegeneration, regardless of AD or FTD, and therefore HSP70 could have a potential role in the follow-up of these disorders.
