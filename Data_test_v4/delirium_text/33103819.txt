33103819|a|INTRODUCTION: Counteracting impaired brain glucose metabolism with ketones may improve cognition in mild cognitive impairment (MCI). METHODS: Cognition, plasma ketone response, and metabolic profile were assessed before and 6 months after supplementation with a ketogenic drink containing medium chain triglyceride (ketogenic medium chain triglyceride [kMCT]; 15 g twice/day; n = 39) or placebo (n = 44). RESULTS: Free and cued recall (Trial 1; P = .047), verbal fluency (categories; P = .024), Boston Naming Test (total correct answers; P = .033), and the Trail-Making Test (total errors; P = .017) improved significantly in the kMCT group compared to placebo (analysis of covariance; pre-intervention score, sex, age, education, and apolipoprotein E4 as covariates). Some cognitive outcomes also correlated positively with plasma ketones. Plasma metabolic profile and ketone response were unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: This kMCT drink improved cognitive outcomes in MCI, at least in part by increasing blood ketone level. These data support further assessment of MCI progression to Alzheimer's disease.
