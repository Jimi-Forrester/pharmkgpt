34479107|a|Self-assembling peptides have become important building blocks for materials design (e.g. hydrogels) and play a crucial role in a range of diseases including Alzheimer and Parkinson. In this context, accessing the nanomechanical properties of ubiquitous beta-sheet rich nanofibres (e.g.: amyloids) is key to the formulation of materials and design of therapies. Although the bulk mechanical properties of hydrogels can easily be accessed using common techniques and equipment, the mechanical properties of their constituent fibres, in particular if with radii in the nanometre scale, are more challenging to measure and estimate. In this work we show for the first time how the rapid nanomechanical mapping technique: amplitude modulation-frequency modulation (AM-FM), can be used to determine the heights, Young's moduli and viscosity coefficients of a series of beta-sheet peptide nanofibres with high statistical confidence. Our results show how peptide sequence and in particular length, charge and interaction with the substrate affect the viscoelastic properties of the peptide fibres.
