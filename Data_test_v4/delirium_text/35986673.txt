35986673|t|Diffusion Tensor Imaging as a Tool to Evaluate the Cognitive Function of Patients With Vascular Dementia: A Meta-Analysis.
35986673|a|BACKGROUND: Vascular dementia (VaD) is the most common type of dementia secondary to Alzheimer's disease. The pathologic mechanism of VaD is complex, and VaD still lacks a more objective diagnosis and evaluation method. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) can better detect the organizational structure and functional characteristics compared with any other diagnosis methods. Therefore, DTI has broad application in evaluating the severity and prognosis of VaD. This study aimed to assess the value of DTI in evaluating the cognitive function of patients with VaD. METHODS: Authors searched Pubmed, Embase, and Cochrane Library, using the search terms, such as "diffusion tensor imaging", "DTI", "Vascular Dementia", "Arteriosclerotic Dementia", "Cognition", and "Cognitive". A voxel-based meta-analysis combined with quality statistics was performed, using the anisotropic effect-size version of the signed differential mapping method. RESULTS: A total of 8 case-control studies were included in this meta-analysis. The sample size of patients ranged from 35 to 60, including 166 patients in the VaD group and 177 healthy individuals. The DTI imaging of the brain tissue of VaD patients was significantly different from that of healthy individuals. CONCLUSIONS: DTI imaging of the brain tissue of VaD patients was clearly different from that of healthy controls. Therefore it may be feasible to use DTI imaging as a diagnostic method for VaD.
