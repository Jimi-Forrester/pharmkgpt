37620146|a|Accumulation of protein aggregates is a hallmark of various neurodegenerative diseases. Selective autophagy mediates the delivery of specific cytoplasmic cargo material into lysosomes for degradation. In aggrephagy, which is the selective autophagy of protein aggregates, the cargo receptors p62 and NBR1 were shown to play important roles in cargo selection. They bind ubiquitinated cargo material via their ubiquitin-associated domains and tether it to autophagic membranes via their LC3-interacting regions. We used mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) in combination with genome editing to obtain further insights into the roles of p62 and NBR1 in aggrephagy. Unexpectedly, our data reveal that both ESCs and ESC-derived neurons do not show strong defects in the clearance of protein aggregates upon knockout of p62 or NBR1 and upon mutation of the p62 ubiquitin-associated domain and the LC3-interacting region motif. Taken together, our results show a robust aggregate clearance in ESCs and ESC-derived neurons. Thus, redundancy between the cargo receptors, other factors, and pathways, such as the ubiquitin-proteasome system, may compensate for the loss of function of p62 and NBR1.
