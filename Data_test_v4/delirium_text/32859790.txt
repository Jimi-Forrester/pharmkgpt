32859790|a|Cattle encephalon glycoside and ignotin (CEGI) injection is known as a multi-target neuroprotective drug that contains numerous liposoluble molecules, such as polypeptides, monosialotetrahexosyl ganglioside (GM-1), free amino acids, hypoxanthine and carnosine. CEGI has been approved by the Chinese State Food and Drug Administration and widely used in the treatments of various diseases, such as stroke and Alzheimer's disease. However, the neuroprotective effects of CEGI beyond the time window of thrombolysis (within 4.5 hours) on acute ischemic stroke remain unclear. This study constructed a rat middle cerebral artery occlusion model by suture-occluded method to simulate ischemic stroke. The first daily dose was intraperitoneally injected at 8 hours post-surgery and the CEGI treatments continued for 14 days. Results of the modified five-point Bederson scale, beam balance test and rotameric test showed the neurological function of ischemic stroke rats treated with 4 mL/kg/d CEGI improved significantly, but the mortality within 14 days did not change significantly. Brain MRI and 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining confirmed that the infarct size in the 4 mL/kg/d CEGI-treated rats was significantly reduced compared with ischemic insult only. The results of transmission electron microscopy and double immunofluorescence staining showed that the hippocampal neuronal necrosis in the ischemic penumbra decreased whereas the immunopositivity of new neuronal-specific protein doublecortin and the percentage of Ki67/doublecortin positive cells increased in CEGI-treated rats compared with untreated rats. Our results suggest that CEGI has an effective neuroprotective effect on ischemic stroke when administered after the time window of thrombolysis. The study was approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of The Third Military Medical University, China.
