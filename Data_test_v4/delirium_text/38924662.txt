METHODS: We applied natural language processing techniques along with machine learning methods to develop a method for automated prediction of progression to AD within 6 years using speech. The study design was evaluated on the neuropsychological test interviews of n = 166 participants from the Framingham Heart Study, comprising 90 progressive MCI and 76 stable MCI cases. RESULTS: Our best models, which used features generated from speech data, as well as age, sex, and education level, achieved an accuracy of 78.5% and a sensitivity of 81.1% to predict MCI-to-AD progression within 6 years. DISCUSSION: The proposed method offers a fully automated procedure, providing an opportunity to develop an inexpensive, broadly accessible, and easy-to-administer screening tool for MCI-to-AD progression prediction, facilitating development of remote assessment. HIGHLIGHTS: Voice recordings from neuropsychological exams coupled with basic demographics can lead to strong predictive models of progression to dementia from mild cognitive impairment. The study leveraged AI methods for speech recognition and processed the resulting text using language models. The developed AI-powered pipeline can lead to fully automated assessment that could enable remote and cost-effective screening and prognosis for Alzehimer's disease.
