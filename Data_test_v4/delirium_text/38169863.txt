38169863|a|Oligoarginine peptides, known mostly for their cell-penetrating properties, are also inhibitors of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). Since octa-arginine (R8) inhibits alpha9alpha10 nAChR and suppresses neuropathic pain, we checked if other polycationic compounds containing amino and/or guanidino groups could be effective and tested the activity of the disulfide-fixed "cyclo"R8, a series of biogenic polyamines (putrescine, spermidine, and spermine), C-methylated spermine analogs, agmatine and its analogs, as well as acylpolyamine argiotoxin-636 from spider venom. Their inhibitory potency on muscle-type, alpha7 and alpha9alpha10 nAChRs was determined using radioligand analysis, electrophysiology, and calcium imaging. "Cyclo"R8 showed similar activity to that of R8 against alpha9alpha10 nAChR (IC50   60 nM). Biogenic polyamines as well as agmatine and its analogs displayed low activity on muscle-type Torpedo californica, as well as alpha7 and alpha9alpha10 nAChRs, which increased with chain length, the most active being spermine and its C-methylated derivatives having IC50 of about 30 muM against muscle-type T. californica nAChR. Argiotoxin-636, which contains a polyamine backbone and terminal guanidino group, also weakly inhibited T. californica nAChR (IC50   15 muM), but it revealed high potency against rat alpha9alpha10 nAChR (IC50   200 nM). We conclude that oligoarginines and similar polycationic compounds effectively inhibiting alpha9alpha10 nAChR may serve as a basis for the development of analgesics to reduce neuropathic pain.
