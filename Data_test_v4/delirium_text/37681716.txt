METHODS: FIP was performed on 37 Wistar rats for creating a sepsis-induced ALI model. The animals were assigned into four groups as follows: Normal control (no treatment), placebo (FIP and saline), and receiving 20 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg per day papaverine. Twenty h after FIP, CT examination was performed for all animals, and HU value of the lung parenchyma was measured. The plasma levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, HMGB1, sRAGE, C-reactive protein (CRP) and malondialdehyde (MDA), and lactic acid (LA) were determined and PaO2 and PaCO2 were measured from arterial blood sample. Lung damage was assessed by histopathological. RESULTS: TNF-, IL-6, CRP, HMGB1, MDA, LA levels, histopathologic scores, and HU values of CT were significantly increased and sRAGE levels were decreased in the saline-treated group against normal group (all P<0.05). Papaverine significantly reversed all results regardless of the dose (all P<0.05) and demonstrated inhibition of HMGB1/RAGE interaction through increasing sRAGE levels and suppresses the pro-inflammatory cytokines. CONCLUSION: We concluded that papaverine has ameliorating effects in rat model of ALI.
