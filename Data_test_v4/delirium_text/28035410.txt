28035410|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder, which is characterized by the selective and progressive death of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra. Increasing evidence suggests that inflammation is important in the degeneration of DA neurons. The purinergic receptor subtype P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) is key in the activation and proliferation of microglia. The present study aimed to examine whether inhibiting purinergic P2X7 receptors is neuroprotective in a rat model of PD, specifically via inhibiting p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). In an intranigral lipopolysaccharide (LPS) rat model of PD, immunohistochemical analysis revealed enhanced expression of P2X7R was observed in microglia. The administration of the P2X7R antagonist, brilliant blue G (BBG), reduced activation of the microglia and the loss of nigral DA neurons. In addition, immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis revealed the phosphorylation level of p38 MAPK increased in the microglia of the LPS-injected rats, which was inhibited by BBG treatment. The p38 MAPK inhibitor, SB203580, reduced microglial activation and the loss of DA neurons. Thus, these findings suggested that inhibition of P2X7R by BBG attenuated microglial activation and the loss of substantia nigra DA neurons via p38 MAPK in the rat LPS model of PD.
