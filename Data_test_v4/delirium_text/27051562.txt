27051562|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder and its reported pathophysiological features in the brain include the deposition of amyloid beta peptide, chronic inflammation, and cognitive impairment. The incidence of AD is increasing worldwide and researchers have studied various aspects of AD pathophysiology in order to improve our understanding of the disease. Thus far, the onset mechanisms and means of preventing AD are completely unknown. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator (PGC-1alpha) is a protein related to various cellular mechanisms that lead to the alteration of downstream gene regulation. It has been reported that PGC-1alpha could protect cells against oxidative stress and reduce mitochondrial dysfunction. Moreover, it has been demonstrated to have a regulatory role in inflammatory signaling and insulin sensitivity related to cognitive function. Here, we present further evidence of the involvement of PGC-1alpha in AD pathogenesis. Clarifying the relationship between PGC-1alpha and AD pathology might highlight PGC-1alpha as a possible target for therapeutic intervention in AD.
