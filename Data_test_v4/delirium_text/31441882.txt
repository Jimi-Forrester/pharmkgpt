31441882|a|Several studies have shown that statin users have a lower risk of new-onset dementia (NOD) compared nonusers. However, other studies have shown opposite results. In this study, we investigated the association between the use of statins and the development of NOD.This was a longitudinal cohort study using data from claim forms submitted to the Taiwanese Bureau of National Health Insurance. The study included patients with NOD and non-NOD subjects from January 2002 to December 2013. We estimated the hazard ratios (HRs) of NOD associated with statin use, whereas nonuser subjects were used as a reference group.A total of 19,522 NOD cases were identified in 100,610 hyperlipidemic patients during the study period. The risk of NOD, after adjusting for sex, age, comorbidities, and concurrent medication, was lower among statin users than nonusers (HR 0.95, 95% CI [confidence interval] 0.94-0.96; P < .001). The adjusted HRs for NOD were 1.53 (95% CI, 1.45-1.62), 0.63 (95% CI, 0.57-0.71), and 0.34 (95% CI, 0.30-0.38) when the cumulative defined daily doses ranged from 28 to 365, 366 to 730, and more than 730 relative to nonusers, respectively.We concluded that statin use is associated with a decreased NOD risk. The protective effect of statins for NOD seemed to be related to high exposure to statins. This study also highlights that high exposure to statins has a dose-response effect on lowering NOD risk.
