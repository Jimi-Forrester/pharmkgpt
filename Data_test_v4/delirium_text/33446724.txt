33446724|t|Adults with current asthma but not former asthma have higher all-cause and cardiovascular mortality: a population-based prospective cohort study.
33446724|a|Higher mortality in asthmatics has been shown previously. However, evidence on different asthma phenotypes on long-term mortality risk is limited. The aim was to evaluate the impact of asthma phenotypes on mortality in general population. Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 2001-2002 to 2013-2014 linked mortality files through December 31, 2015, were used (N = 37,015). Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate the risk of all-cause and cause-specific mortality adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics, smoking, body mass index, and chronic conditions. During the mean follow-up time of 7.5 years, 4326 participants died from a variety of causes. Current asthma, but not former asthma was associated with increased all-cause mortality (current asthma: HR = 1.37; 95% CI 1.20-1.58; Former asthma: HR = 0.93; 95% CI 0.73-1.18); as well as mortality from cardiovascular disease (HRCurrent = 1.41; 95% CI 1.08-1.85) and chronic lower respiratory diseases (HRCurrent = 3.17; 95% CI 1.96-5.14). In addition, we found that the HR for cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality was slightly greater in people with childhood-onset asthma than those with adult-onset asthma. The HR for chronic lower respiratory diseases (CLRD) mortality was greater in people with adult-onset asthma than those with childhood-onset asthma. However, the differences were not statistically significant. Our study suggested that current asthma but not former asthma was associated with increased all-cause, CLRD and CVD mortality. Future well-designed studies with larger sample are required to demonstrate the association and clarify the potential mechanisms involved.
