39538982|t|Perspective on the Coevolutionary Role of Host and Gut Microbiota in Polyphenol Health Effects: Metabotypes and Precision Health.
39538982|a|"Personalized nutrition" aims to establish nutritional strategies to improve health outcomes for non-responders. However, it is utopian since most people share similar nutritional requirements. "Precision health," encompassing lifestyles, may be more fitting. Dietary (poly)phenols are "healthy" but non-nutritional molecules (thus, we can live without them). The gut microbiota influences (poly)phenol effects, producing metabolites with different activity than their precursors. Furthermore, producing distinctive metabolites, like urolithins, lunularin, and equol, leads to the term "polyphenol-related gut microbiota metabotypes," grouping individuals based on a genuine microbial metabolism of ellagic acid, resveratrol, and isoflavones, respectively. Additionally, (poly)phenols exert prebiotic-like effects through their antimicrobial activities, typically reducing microbial diversity and modulating microbiota functionality by impacting its composition and transcriptomics. Since the gut microbiota perceives (poly)phenols as a threat, (poly)phenol effects are mostly a consequence of microbiota adaptation through differential (poly)phenol metabolism (e.g., distinctive reductions, dehydroxylations, etc.). This viewpoint is less prosaic than considering (poly)phenols as essential nutritional players in human health, yet underscores their health significance in a coevolutionary partnership with the gut microbiota. In the perspective on the gut microbiota and (poly)phenols interplay, microbiota metabotypes could arbiter health effects. An innovative aspect is also emphasized: modulating the interacting microbial networks without altering the composition.
