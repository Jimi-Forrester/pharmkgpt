38444477|t|The feasibility of dexmedetomidine-led anesthesia maintenance strategy during major abdominal surgery.
38444477|a|Background: Dexmedetomidine is known for its selective action on alpha2-adrenoceptor sites and is recognized for its neuroprotective capabilities. It can improve postoperative cognitive function. Commonly used anesthetics, such as sevoflurane and propofol, have been reported to affect postoperative cognitive function. Therefore, it could be valuable to explore dexmedetomidine-led anesthesia strategy. This study was designed to assess the performance, safety, and effective infusion rate in anesthesia maintenance, to explore a feasible dexmedetomidine-led anesthesia maintenance protocol, and to provide a foundation for potential combined anesthesia. Methods: Thirty patients aged 18-60 years, classified as ASA I or II, undergoing abdominal surgery were involved. The anesthesia maintenance was achieved with dexmedetomidine, remifentanil and rocuronium. Dixon up-and-down sequential methodology was utilized to ascertain the ED50 of dexmedetomidine for maintaining Patient State Index (PSI) 25-40 (depth of stage III anesthesia). Intraoperative HR, BP and depth of anesthesia were monitored and controlled. The wake-up time from anesthesia, the incidence of intraoperative awareness and postoperative delirium, and the patients' satisfaction were assessed. Results: The results indicated that dexmedetomidine-led anesthesia could maintain the depth of stage III anesthesia during abdominal surgery. The ED50 and ED95 of dexmedetomidine infusion rates during anesthesia maintenance were 2.298 mug/kg h (95%CI: 2.190-2.404 mug/kg h) and 3.765 mug/kg h (95%CI: 3.550-4.050 mug/kg h). Continuous infusion of dexmedetomidine and 0.1-0.3 mug/kg min remifentanil could maintain PSI 25-40, and provide appropriate anesthesia depth for abdominal surgery. Perioperative bradycardia and hypertension could be rapidly corrected with atropine and nitroglycerin. The median wake-up time after anesthesia was 4.8 min, the perioperative maximum HR had significant correlation with wake-up time and intraoperative dexmedetomidine dose. No intraoperative awareness and postoperative delirium occurred; the patients were satisfied with dexmedetomidine-led anesthesia. Conclusions: dexmedetomidine-led strategy could maintain stable depth of anesthesia throughout surgery, and the ED50 of dexmedetomidine infusion rates was 2.298 mug/kg h. Intraoperative HR, BP and depth of anesthesia require monitoring, the bradycardia and hypertension could be rapidly corrected.
