31136180|t|Identification of Alzheimer's Disease Autoantibodies and Their Target Biomarkers by Phage Microarrays.
31136180|a|The characterization of the humoral response in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients might aid in detecting the disease at early stages. We have combined phage display and protein microarrays to identify AD autoantibodies and their target biomarkers. After enrichment of the T7 phage display libraries from AD and healthy brain tissue mRNA in AD-specific phages, 1536 monoclonal phages were printed on microarrays to probe them with 8 AD and 8 healthy control sera. A total of 57 phages showed higher seroreactivity in AD. In total, 13 out of the 44 unique sequences displayed on the phages were selected for validation using 68 AD and 52 healthy control sera. Peptides from Anthrax toxin receptor 1, Nuclear protein 1, Glycogen phosphorylase, and Olfactory receptor 8J1 expressed in bacteria as HaloTag fusion proteins showed a statistically significant ability to discriminate between AD patients and controls. The identified panel of AD autoantibodies might provide new insights into the blood-based diagnosis of the disease.
