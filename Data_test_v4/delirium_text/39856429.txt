39856429|t|Predictors of prolonged hospitalization among geriatric trauma patients using the modified 5-Item Frailty index in a Middle Eastern trauma center: an 11-year retrospective study.
39856429|a|BACKGROUND: Using a validated tool, we explored the prevalence, risk factors, and predictors of longer hospitalization among hospitalized geriatric patients. METHODS: Retrospective and comparative analyses of age groups (55-64 vs. >= 65 years), gender, survival status, and frailty index categories were performed. The Modified 5-Item Frailty Index was assessed, and multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to predict prolonged hospitalization (> 7 days). RESULTS: There were 17,600 trauma hospitalizations with a mean age of 32 +- 15 years between 2010 and 2021; of them, 9.2% were geriatrics at >= 55-64 years (n = 935) and >= 65 years (n = 691). The female/male ratio was 17.5%/82.5%, and the mean injury severity score was 13 +- 9. The injury rate for age >= 65 was 24 per 10,000 compared to 10 per 10,000 in the younger group age (>= 55-64). 35% of injuries occurred at home due to falls. Overall mortality was 8%, with a higher rate among males than females (9% vs. 4%). The deceased were three years older at the time of death compared to the survivors. Higher frailty grades were associated with home-related falls and head injuries. Patients 65 years or older were likely to have higher frailty scores, as indicated by higher percentages in the mFI-5. Among the older group, 25% were moderately frail, and 18% severely frail. In the younger group, 50% were frail. Higher frailty scores correlated with increased acute kidney injury, pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and longer hospital stays. Severe frailty significantly predicted longer hospitalization (odds ratio 1.83, p = 0.007). CONCLUSION: One out of eleven trauma admissions was aged > 55. Head injury and bleeding were the leading causes of mortality in the study cohort. There was a significant decrease in the trend of geriatric trauma over the years. The modified FI-5 performs well as a predictive tool of prolonged hospitalizaion in trauma patients with different age groups.
