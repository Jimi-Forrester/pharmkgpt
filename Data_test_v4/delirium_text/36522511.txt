36522511|t|Modulatory Activity of the Endocannabinoid System in the Development and Proliferation of Cells in the CNS.
36522511|a|The Endocannabinoid System (ECS, also known as Endocannabinoidome) plays a key role in the function of the Central Nervous System, though the participation of this system on the early development - specifically in neuroprotection and proliferation of nerve cells - has been poorly studied. Here, we collect and describe evidence regarding how cannabinoid receptors CB1R and CB2R regulate several cell markers related to proliferation. While CB1R participates in the modulation of neuronal and glial proliferation, CB2R is involved in the proliferation of glial cells. The endocannabinoids anandamide (AEA) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) exert significant effects on nerve cell proliferation. AEA generated during embryogenesis induces major effects on the differentiation of neuronal progenitor cells, whereas 2-AG participates in modulating cell migration events rather than affecting the neural proliferation rate. However, although the ECS has been demonstrated to participate in neuroprotection, more characterization on its role in neuronal and glial proliferation and differentiation is needed, especially in brain areas with recognized high neurogenesis rates. This has encouraged scientists to elucidate and propose specific mechanisms related with these cell proliferation mechanisms to better understand some neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson, Huntington and Alzheimer diseases, in which neuronal loss and poor neurogenesis are crucial factors for their onset and progression. In this review, we collect and present recent evidence published pointing to an active role of the ECS in the development and proliferation of nerve cells.
