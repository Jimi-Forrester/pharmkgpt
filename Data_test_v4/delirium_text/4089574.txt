4089574|t|[Respiratory distress syndrome and hypothermia in Wernicke's encephalopathy].
4089574|a|A patient is reported who developed adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypothermia during the decompensated phase of Wernicke encephalopathy. The absence of other causes suggests a neurogenic origin for the hypothermia, possibly as a result of lesions localized in the posterior hypothalamus. A hemodynamic study during normothermia, hypothermia and rewarming showed that at body temperatures inferior to 32 degrees C the increase in pulmonary vascular resistances seems not to be the result of a real vasoconstrictor effect in the pulmonary circulation. The Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome may have a clinical picture similar to delirium tremens, evolving into coma with complications such as hypothermia and, possibly, ARDS.
