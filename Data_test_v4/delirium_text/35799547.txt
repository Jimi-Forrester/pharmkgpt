35799547|a|Previous studies have shown that berberine has neuroprotective effects against Alzheimer's disease, including antagonizing tau phosphorylation, and inhibiting acetylcholinesterase activity and neural cell apoptosis. However, its low bioavailability and adverse reactions with conventional administration limit its clinical application. In this study, we prepared berberine nanoliposomes using liposomes characterized by low toxicity, high entrapment efficiency, and biodegradability, and modified them with lactoferrin. Lactoferrin-modified berberine nanoliposomes had uniform particle size and high entrapment efficiency. We used the lactoferrin-modified berberine nanoliposomes to treat a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease established by injection of amyloid-beta 1-42 into the lateral ventricle. Lactoferrin-modified berberine nanoliposomes inhibited acetylcholinesterase activity and apoptosis in the hippocampus, reduced tau over-phosphorylation in the cerebral cortex, and improved mouse behavior. These findings suggest that modification with lactoferrin can enhance the neuroprotective effects of berberine nanoliposomes in Alzheimer's disease.
