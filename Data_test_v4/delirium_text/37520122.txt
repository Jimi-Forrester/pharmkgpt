37520122|t|The effect of physical activity on white matter integrity in aging and prodromal to mild Alzheimer's disease with vascular comorbidity.
37520122|a|Background: Physical activity is a modifiable lifestyle factor that has been previously associated with reduced vascular burden and reduced risk of dementia. Objectives: This study tested whether physical activity (i.e., being inactive vs. active) contributed to preservation of white matter microstructure in healthy aging controls and patients in prodromal to mild Alzheimer's disease with low/high vascular burden. Materials: A total of 213 participants were recruited from memory clinics. They were classified as being either physically active (n = 113) or inactive (n = 100) based on the Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging and Dementia (CAIDE) questionnaire. Diffusion-weighted images were acquired for all participants and pre-processed based on a standard protocol. Methods: A factorial design using voxel-wise tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) was adopted, with 5,000 permutations and threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE), to identify significant clusters for fractional anisotropy (FA), axial diffusivity (AxD), mean diffusivity (MD), and radial diffusivity (RD). Results: Clusters of higher FA and lower AxD, MD, and RD values were found for physically active compared with inactive participants that were widespread covering mainly association and projection tracts but also some commissural tracts. A three-way Group x Physical Activity x Vascular Burden interaction effect was found for FA mostly in a variety of projection tracts with a right predominance, and some commissural and association tracts. Post hoc analyses revealed higher FA in patients with high vascular burden who were physically active compared with those patients with high vascular burden who were inactive mainly in projection and association/limbic tracts with a right predominance. Additionally, higher FA was observed in physically active patients with high vascular burden as compared with physically inactive controls with high vascular burden, mainly in bilateral projection fibers and cerebellar regions. Conclusion: Voxel-wise TBSS analysis revealed better preservation of white matter microstructure that was prominent in the high-risk group such as the patients with high vascular burden, specifically those who were physically active. The beneficial effects of physical activity on white matter microstructure were not observed in the controls.
