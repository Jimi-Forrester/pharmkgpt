33426266|a|INTRODUCTION: We determine whether diminished Learning Over Repeated Exposures (LORE) identifies subtle memory decrements in cognitively unimpaired (CU) older adults with Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarker burden. METHODS: Ninety-four CU participants (mean age = 77.6 +- 5.02) completed a challenging associative memory test, at home, monthly, for up to 1 year (mean = 9.97 months) on a study-issued iPad. Learning curves for face-name memory were computed for two versions completed monthly: same face-name pairs (A-A-A) and alternate face-name pairs (B-C-D). Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging characterized global amyloid (Pittsburgh Compound-B (PiB); amyloid beta (Abeta)+/-) and regional tau burden (flortaucipir). RESULTS: Diminished LORE for same (but not alternate) face-name pairs was associated with greater amyloid and tau burden. Abeta+/- group differences for same face-name pairs emerged by the fourth exposure and was of medium-to-large magnitude (Cohen's d = 0.66; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.25-1.08). DISCUSSION: Subtle decrements in learning related to AD pathological burden in CU are detectable over short time-intervals (ie, months). Implications for prevention trial design are discussed.
