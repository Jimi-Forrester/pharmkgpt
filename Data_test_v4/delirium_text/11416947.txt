11416947|a|The objective of this study was to develop a variety of sensory stimulation products for the behavioral intervention of patients with Alzheimer's type dementia. Many caregivers have relied on physical and chemical restraints as the primary method of patient intervention due to the lack of appropriate dementia management products. This significantly lowers the sufferer's quality of care and life. As the age group most susceptible to Alzheimer's disease (65 and older) is the fastest growing segment of our society, an appropriate care solution must be sought. The specific aim of this study was to develop products that are sensory satisfying for the Alzheimer's patient that exhibits self-stimulatory wandering behavior. Sensory satisfying objects for product development would be determined through structured observations of self-stimulatory wanderers in an institutionalized setting. Variations of product design and mounting would be pursued in order to develop products that are not only safe and effective for patient use, but are easy for the caregiver to implement and maintain. Such products would have widespread commercial application in both the institutional and private care settings such as nursing homes, adult day care facilities, Alzheimer's care facilities, convalescent homes, mental health institutions, and assisted-living facilities.
