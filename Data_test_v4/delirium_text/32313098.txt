32313098|t|A U-shaped Association of Breastfeeding Duration with Cognitive Impairment in Chinese Postmenopausal Women.
32313098|a|Breastfeeding is related to maternal health. However, the association of women's breastfeeding duration with cognitive function in their later life is limited and inconsistent. The aim of this study was to accurately evaluate the association in Chinese postmenopausal women. We analyzed the data from Zhejiang Ageing and Health Cohort Study including 5487 postmenopausal women. Cognitive impairment was assessed via the Mini-Mental State Examination. Data on breastfeeding duration was collected in the reproductive history section within the questionnaire. Generalized additive models (GAMs) and logistic regression models, controlled for an extensive range of potential confounders, were generated to examine the associations. A U-shaped association was identified between breastfeeding duration and cognitive impairment based on GAM. The nadir with lowest odds of cognitive impairment was ascertained by quadratic model as 12 months. The logistic models showed that compared with women breastfeeding 12 months per child, the fully adjusted odds ratios (ORs) were 1.50 (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.20-1.88), 1.58 (95% CI: 1.29-1.93), 1.33 (95% CI: 1.06-1.68), 2.08 (95% CI: 1.64-2.65) for those averagely breastfeeding <6, 6-<12,>12-18,>18 months, respectively. Furthermore, we did not observe significant effect modification of the association. Future longitudinal studies are needed to confirm the association.
