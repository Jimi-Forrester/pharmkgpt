25245385|t|Factors Associated With Preferences for Institutionalized Care in Elderly Persons: Comparing Hypothetical Conditions of Permanent Disability and Alzheimer's Disease.
25245385|a|OBJECTIVE: To study the willingness to use institutional care versus home care in hypothetical situations of permanent disability and Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHOD: A convenience sample of 484 adults aged 45 and older was obtained. Respondents were asked about their care preferences in case they were diagnosed with AD or became permanently disabled. Based on Andersen's extended behavioral model, a large group of correlates was examined. RESULTS: Institutional care was preferred in the situation of becoming sick with AD, whereas being cared for at home by the family was preferred in a situation of permanent disability. Fear of losing one's independence and concern over burdening the family were associated with care preferences in both situations. DISCUSSION: Although some similarities exist between the correlates for care preferences in the two distinct situations, there are noticeable differences. These are discussed and implications for practice are suggested.
