34168445|t|Curcumin-Loaded Hybrid Nanoparticles: Microchannel-Based Preparation and Antitumor Activity in a Mouse Model.
34168445|a|PURPOSE: To develop microchannel-based preparation of curcumin (Cur)-loaded hybrid nanoparticles using enzyme-targeted peptides and star-shaped polycyclic lipids as carriers, and to accomplish a desirable targeted drug delivery via these nanoparticles, which could improve the bioavailability and antitumor effects of Cur. METHODS: The amphiphilic tri-chaintricarballylic acid-poly (epsilon-caprolactone)-methoxypolyethylene glycol (Tri-CL-mPEG) and the enzyme-targeted tetra-chain pentaerythritol-poly (epsilon-caprolactone)-polypeptide (PET-CL-P) were synthesized. The Cur-loaded enzyme-targeted hybrid nano-delivery systems (Cur-P-NPs) were prepared by using the microfluidic continuous granulation technology. The physicochemical properties, release behavior in vitro, and stability of these Cur-P-NPs were investigated. Their cytotoxicity, cellular uptake, anti-proliferative efficacy in vitro, biodistribution, and antitumor effects in vivo were also studied. RESULTS: The particle size of the prepared Cur-P-NPs was 146.1 +- 1.940 nm, polydispersity index was 0.175 +- 0.014, zeta potential was 10.1 +- 0.300 mV, encapsulation rate was 74.66 +- 0.671%, and drug loading capacity was 5.38 +- 0.316%. The stability of Cur-P-NPs was adequate, and the in vitro release rate increased with the decrease of the environmental pH. Seven days post incubation, the cumulative release values of Cur were 52.78%, 67.39%, and 98.12% at pH 7.4, pH 6.8 and pH 5.0, respectively. Cur-P-NPs exhibited better cell entry and antiproliferation efficacy against U251 cells than the Cur-solution and Cur-NPs and were safe for use. Cur-P-NPs specifically targeted tumor tissues and inhibited their growth (78.63% tumor growth inhibition rate) with low toxic effects on normal tissues. CONCLUSION: The enzyme-targeted hybrid nanoparticles prepared in the study clearly have the tumor-targeting ability. Cur-P-NPs can effectively improve the bioavailability of Cur and have potential applications in drug delivery and tumor management.
