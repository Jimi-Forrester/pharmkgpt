37726660|t|Association of intraoperative cerebral and somatic tissue oxygen saturation with postoperative acute kidney injury in adult patients undergoing multiple valve surgery.
37726660|a|BACKGROUND: The association between tissue oxygenation with postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI) in adult patients undergoing multiple valve surgery has not been specifically studied. METHODS: In this prospective exploratory cohort study, 99 patients were enrolled. The left forehead, the left forearm, the left upper thigh, and the left renal region tissue oxygen saturation using near-infrared spectroscopy were monitored. The association between each threshold and AKI was assessed. The relative and absolute thresholds were < 70%, < 75%, < 80%, < 85%, < 90%, < 95%, and < 100% baseline, and baseline-standard deviation (SD), -1.5 SD, -2 SD, -2.5 SD, and -3 SD. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was adopted to explore the association. RESULTS: AKI occurred in 53 (54%) patients. The absolute value-based SrrO2 thresholds associated with AKI were baseline-3 SD (odds ratio [OR], 4.629; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.238-17.314; P = 0.023) and baseline-2.5 SD (OR, 2.842; 95% CI, 1.025-7.881; P = 0.045) after adjusting for the potential confounders, those are renal region tissue oxygen saturation of 55% and 60%, but not statistically significant after correcting for multiple testing (corrected P = 0.114 and 0.179, respectively). CONCLUSION: The SrrO2 desaturation, defined as < baseline - 2.5 SD or < baseline - 3 SD, may be associated with AKI. The thresholds need to be verified in future large-scale studies. TRIAL REGISTRATIONS: The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, first trial registration: 26/10/2017, identifier: NCT03323203.
