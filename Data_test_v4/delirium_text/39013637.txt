39013637|t|Olanzapine postinjection delirium/sedation syndrome after long-acting olanzapine depot injection presenting to the emergency department: practical guidelines for diagnosis and management.
39013637|a|Olanzapine long-acting injection is a commonly used antipsychotic drug formulation in the treatment of schizophrenia. Postinjection delirium/sedation syndrome (PDSS) is a potential side effect of this intramuscular depot, for which patients are often presented at the ED. In this article, we give an overview of the current literature outlining the key aspects of managing this syndrome in a critical care setting, illustrated by a typical fictional clinical case. We discuss several useful and practical aspects of PDSS for emergency physicians and critical care physicians, including pharmacological background, common symptoms, diagnostic criteria and therapeutic options.
