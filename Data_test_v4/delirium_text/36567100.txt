36567100|t|[A case of non-fluent/agrammatic variant of primary progressive aphasia with logoclonia].
36567100|a|We report a case of non-fluent/agrammatic variant of primary progressive aphasia in a 79-year-old right-handed man who was admitted with a 5-year history of non-fluent speech and apraxia of speech. He also presented with agrammatism and logoclonia (the meaningless repetition of the middle or final syllable of a word). Furthermore, brain MRI revealed atrophy of the bilateral frontal and temporal lobes, while N-isopropyl-p-123I-iodoamphetamine single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) revealed relative hypoperfusion in the right basal ganglia. In addition, dopamine transporter SPECT revealed a decrease in specific binding ratio values, indicating neural dopamine dysfunction, which led to his diagnosis of progressive non-fluent aphasia with logoclonia. Logoclonia is a severe linguistic dysfunction usually observed in the advanced stages of Alzheimer's disease. However, based on the clinical course and cerebrospinal fluid evaluation results, our patient did not show any features of Alzheimer's disease. Thus, logoclonia might be associated with lesions involving the basal ganglia, right hemisphere, and left frontotemporal lobe.
