36472212|t|Adaptable toolbox to characterize Alzheimer's disease pathology in mouse models.
36472212|a|Here, we describe a highly adaptable toolbox for characterizing and analyzing molecular and histopathological changes in Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse models. We detail optimized and streamlined approaches from sample preparation to image analysis to facilitate reproducible analyses. We also describe the extraction and measurement of the soluble Abeta level by sandwich ELISA in the cortex and hippocampus of AD mouse models before and after plaque deposition. Finally, we outline the steps for image quantification and analysis using Imaris and ImageJ. For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to Huang et al. (2021).1.
