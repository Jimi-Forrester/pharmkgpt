29410801|a|Normal gait data reported show variability depending on specific equipment and techniques. Reference values of initial contact angle (ICA) and toe-off angle (TOA) are still lacking. We present a normative gait database of 292 healthy adults using the APDM Movement Monitoring inertial sensor system across a large age span of adulthood. Data were collected as participants completed a walk test for 2 min. Normalization was conducted and two factors were extracted by a factor analysis. Six reference gait variables under each factor were presented and the impacts of age, gender and BMI were evaluated by MANOVA and ANCOVA. ICA and TOA were highly correlated with speed and stride length. ICA was significantly larger in men, whereas larger TOA could be observed in women in all age groups but could not achieve significant difference. Overweight and obese adults walked at significantly lower speed, shorter stride length, reduced cadence and longer gait cycle duration. TOA was smaller in the obese group. However, the differences in ICA were not significant. Reference gait values described herein were valuable for identifying and interpreting gait phenomena using APDM , contributing to rehabilitation of gait dysfunction.
