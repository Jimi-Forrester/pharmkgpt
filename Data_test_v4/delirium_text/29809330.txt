29809330|a|INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia. It is characterized by histopathological hallmarks such as senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, as well as a concomitant activation of microglial cells and astrocytes that release pro-inflammatory mediators such as IL-1beta, iNOS, and COX-2, leading to neuronal dysfunction and death. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of quercetin on the inflammatory response in the CA1 area of the hippocampus in a 3xTg-AD male and female mice model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Animals were injected intraperitoneally with quercetin every 48 hours during three months, and we conducted histological and biochemical studies. RESULTS: We found that in quercetin-treated 3xTg-AD mice, reactive microglia and fluorescence intensity of Abeta aggregates significantly decreased. GFAP, iNOS, and COX-2 immunoreactivity also decreased and we observed a clear tendency in the reduction of IL-1beta in hippocampal lysates. CONCLUSION: Our work suggests an anti-inflammatory effect of quercetin in the CA1 hippocampal region of aged triple transgenic Alzheimer's disease mice.
