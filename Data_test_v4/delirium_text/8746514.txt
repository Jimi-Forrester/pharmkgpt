8746514|t|Release of nitric oxide from astroglial cells: a key mechanism in neuroimmune disorders.
8746514|a|Astrocytes are glial cells able to release nitric oxide (NO) under basal conditions as well as following different neurochemical stimuli including cytokines, endotoxins and soluble antigens, thereby participating in neuroimmune responses. In particular, the inducible isoform of NO synthase seems to be activated during co-incubation of this cell type with cytokines as well as in the presence of the HIV coating gp120 glycoprotein, an effect which is associated with an enhancement of prostanoid release. This seems also to occur via activation of cyclooxygenase by NO. Thus, the L-arginine-NO pathway found in astrocytes may represent a novel approach in the treatment of neuroimmune disorders such as multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease and AIDS.
