38149117|t|Fatal outcome of dengue fever with multi-organ failure and hemorrhage: A case report.
38149117|a|Dengue fever is a prevalent viral disease caused by a single-stranded positive RNA virus belonging to the Flaviviridae family, genus flavivirus. It is characterized by fever, headache, myalgias, leukopenia, rash, and plasma leakage, which may progress to compensated or uncompensated shock and multi-organ failure. Liver involvement is a common feature of Dengue fever and is usually manifested by nausea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort, anorexia, hepatomegaly, and elevated serum transaminase levels. Severe disease is associated with laboratory parameters such as mean Platelet count < 20,000/mm, Aspartate Transaminase Levels >45 IU, and lymphocytes <1500. The Expanded Dengue Syndrome (EDS), a term coined by World Health Organization in 2012, refers to an atypical presentation of Dengue fever that manifests with generalized impacts on normal physiology. This case report presents a 29-year-old male with EDS who presented at a Tertiary Care Hospital in Karachi and died a week later due to liver failure.
