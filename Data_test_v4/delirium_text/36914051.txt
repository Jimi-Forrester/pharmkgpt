36914051|a|BACKGROUND: A substantial proportion of individuals with late-life major depression could be classified as having a suspected non-Alzheimer disease pathophysiology (SNAP), as indicated by a negative test for the biomarker beta-amyloid (Abeta-) but a positive test for neurodegeneration (ND+). This study investigated the clinical features, characteristic patterns of brain atrophy and hypometabolism, and implications regarding pathology in this population. METHODS: Forty-six amyloid-negative patients with late-life major depressive disorder (MDD) patients, including 23 SNAP (Abeta-/ND+) and 23 Abeta-/ND- MDD subjects, and 22 Abeta-/ND-healthy control subjects were included in this study. Voxel-wise group comparisons between the SNAP MDD, Abeta-/ND- MDD and control subjects were performed, adjusting for age, gender and level of education. For exploratory comparisons, 8 Abeta+/ND- and 4 Abeta+/ND + MDD patients were included in the Supplementary Material. RESULTS: The SNAP MDD patients had atrophy extending to regions outside the hippocampus, predominately in the medial temporal, dorsomedial and ventromedial prefrontal cortex; hypometabolism involving a large portion of the lateral and medial prefrontal cortex in addition to the bilateral temporal, parietal and precuneus cortex within typical Alzheimer disease regions were observed. Metabolism ratios of the inferior to the medial temporal lobe were significantly elevated in the SNAP MDD patients. We further discussed the implications with regards to underlying pathologies. CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrated characteristic patterns of atrophy and hypometabolism in patients with late-life major depression with SNAP. Identifying individuals with SNAP MDD may provide insights into currently unspecified neurodegenerative processes. Future refinement of neurodegeneration biomarkers is essential in order to identify potential pathological correlates while in vivo reliable pathological biomarkers are not forthcoming.
