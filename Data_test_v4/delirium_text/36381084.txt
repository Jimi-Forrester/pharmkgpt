36381084|t|Association between serum irisin concentration and ischemic stroke: From etiology to clinic.
36381084|a|Background: To investigate the relationship between irisin levels in serum and classification of subtype of acute ischemic stroke, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and Modified Rankin Score (mRS) at the time of discharge from the hospital in Turkish patients who had their first acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Methods: Serum irisin levels were measured using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) 180 patients who applied to emergency department with the diagnosis of AIS from May 2021 to November 2021. Results: A significant relationship was found between serum irisin levels and ischemic stroke aetiological factors (TAOST) (p=0.017). Increased serum irisin levels were detected in patients without neurological deficits with localization value than those with it (p<0.01). Serum irisin levels also have a negative correlation with high-density lipoprotein (HDL) value in ischemic stroke (r: -0.272, p<0.01). Conclusions: High serum irisin levels found in patients with stroke attributed to small vessel disease and in patients with ischemic stroke in whom we did not find any neurological deficits with a localization value. The results of the study show that serum irisin levels have an important role in the etiology of ischemic stroke. Although the question how the irisin is involved in the course of ischemic stroke and what the clinical reflection has not been answered, these findings are a pioneering study on this subject.
