7951678|a|Lipofuscin, the age pigment, is of interest in Alzheimer's disease because of its property to accumulate in neurons and because of the hypothesis that Alzheimer's dementia is a kind of premature ageing. The amount of intraneuronal lipofuscin in the inferior olivary nucleus of 20 brains from patients with histologically confirmed Alzheimer's disease according to the CERAD protocol and of 20 controls has been measured microfluorometrically. Patients and controls were matched for age. The amount of lipofuscin in the neurons of the inferior olivary nucleus did not differ significantly between the cases of Alzheimer's disease and the controls. The result is discussed taking the findings of previous authors into account. We conclude that there is no evidence that lipofuscin plays an important role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.
