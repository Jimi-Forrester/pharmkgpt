18795347|t|Probable risk factors for postoperative delirium in patients undergoing spinal surgery.
18795347|a|Postoperative delirium and its risk factors had been widely reported in several kinds of surgeries; however, there is only one known article relative to postoperative delirium in spinal surgery. We retrospectively examined the incidence of postoperative delirium and the probable risk factors in patients undergoing spinal surgery in our hospital, with the same aged non-delirium patients as controls, over a 6-month period. Studies about postoperative delirium were reviewed and referenced for variable factors collecting in our study. T tests, chi(2) test and logistic regression analysis were performed to evaluate the various factors related to postoperative delirium. A total of 18 patients (3.3%), all of them were aged 54 years or older, had postoperative delirium after surgery. Patients without postoperative delirium aged 54 years or older served as the control group. The percentage of patients older than 65 years (P = 0.003), with comorbid diseases such as diabetes mellitus (P = 0.042) or central nervous system disorders (P = 0.013), with a surgical history (P = 0.028) in delirium group was larger than the control group. The absolute number of medications being taken before the operation in the delirium patients was also more than the control group (P = 0.000). The percentage of patients transfused with 800 mL or more blood was also larger (P = 0.024) in delirium group was larger than the control group. Logistic regression analysis showed that central nervous system disorder (OR 6.480), surgical history (OR 3.499), age older than 65 years (OR 3.390), diabetes mellitus (OR 2.981), transfused 800 mL or more blood (OR 2.537), and hemoglobin less than 100 g/L (OR 0.281) were significantly related to the occurrence postoperative delirium. Our findings suggest that postoperative delirium in spinal surgery can also occurred in younger patients and with an acceptable incidence in total. The risk for postoperative delirium is multifactorial. More prospective research is necessary in order to evaluate these and other risk factors in greater detail.
