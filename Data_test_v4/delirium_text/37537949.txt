37537949|t|Drug-Drug Interaction Study of Ciprofol and Sodium Divalproex: Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacodynamics, and Safety in Healthy Chinese Subjects.
37537949|a|Ciprofol (also known as HSK3486) is a promising intravenous anesthetic candidate derived from propofol and independently developed by Haisco Pharmaceutical Group Co., Ltd. (Chengdu, China). Compared with propofol, ciprofol has the potential to reduce the dose required and the associated risks. Ciprofol is extensively metabolized in vivo, and its interaction with other concurrently administered drugs during clinical application is worthy of attention. Therefore, an open-label, two-stage sequential study was performed in healthy subjects who received either a single administration of ciprofol injection or ciprofol injection after oral administration of sodium divalproex. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effects of sodium divalproex on ciprofol with respect to pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and safety, thus providing a basis for the rational clinical use of ciprofol and sodium divalproex.
