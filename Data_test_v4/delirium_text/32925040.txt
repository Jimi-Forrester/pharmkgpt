32925040|t|Traumatic Injury Reduces Amyloid Plaque Burden in the Transgenic 5xFAD Alzheimer's Mouse Spinal Cord.
32925040|a|BACKGROUND: Axonal injury has been implicated in the development of amyloid-beta in experimental brain injuries and clinical cases. The anatomy of the spinal cord provides a tractable model for examining the effects of trauma on amyloid deposition. OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to examine the effects of axonal injury on plaque formation and clearance using wild type and 5xFAD transgenic Alzheimer's disease mice. METHODS: We contused the spinal cord at the T12 spinal level at 10 weeks, an age at which no amyloid plaques spontaneously accumulate in 5xFAD mice. We then explored plaque clearance by impacting spinal cords in 27-week-old 5xFAD mice where amyloid deposition is already well established. We also examined the cellular expression of one of the most prominent amyloid-beta degradation enzymes, neprilysin, at the lesion site. RESULTS: No plaques were found in wild type animals at any time points examined. Injury in 5xFAD prevented plaque deposition rostral and caudal to the lesion when the cords were examined at 2 and 4 months after the impact, whereas age-matched naive 5xFAD mice showed extensive amyloid plaque deposition. A massive reduction in the number of plaques around the lesion was found as early as 7 days after the impact, preceded by neprilysin upregulation in astrocytes at 3 days after injury. At 7 days after injury, the majority of amyloid was found inside microglia/macrophages. CONCLUSION: These observations suggest that the efficient amyloid clearance after injury in the cord may be driven by the orchestrated efforts of astroglial and immune cells.
