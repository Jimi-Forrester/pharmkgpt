8928529|a|The therapy of the alcohol withdrawal syndrome is very heterogeneous with more than 100 drug combinations. This results from differently qualified physicians and from insufficient pharmacostudies concerning evaluation and psychopathological methodology of the alcohol withdrawal syndrome. The following advices can be given: Physical withdrawal should take place under the conditions of an appropriate hospital with a qualified team. The application of electrolytes and vitamines (B1) may be necessary in alcohol addicts. Less severe alcohol withdrawal syndromes are treated sufficiently with carbamazepine, sometimes it can be necessary to combine it with neuroleptics or benzodiazepines. A secure prevention from delirium tremens and its treatment is only guaranteed by clomethiazole or benzodiazepines. To reduce the doses of those drugs, combinations with neuroleptics are possible. In general voluntary physical withdrawal proves only to be successful if longtime abstinence is planned and a motivation program is setup the for withdrawal treatment.
