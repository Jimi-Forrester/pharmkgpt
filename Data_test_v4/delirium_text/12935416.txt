12935416|a|OBJECTIVE: To explore the frequency and significance of ApoE gene polymorphisms in patients with sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: Single nucleotide polymorphisms of the ApoE gene were analyzed in 32 cases of AD and 26 controls, using PCR and gene sequencing. RESULTS: The single nucleotide polymorphism of ApoE gene 462C/G was significantly associated with AD (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The 462C/G polymorphism might be a specific genotype in Chinese patients with sporadic AD.
