26945100|a|Active and passive immunotherapy targeting amyloid-beta (Abeta) may be the most promising strategy to prevent or treat Alzheimer's disease (AD). Previously, immunization with the recombinant 6Abeta15-T antigen generated robust anti-Abeta serum antibodies that strongly recognized Abeta42 oligomers in different mice, markedly reduced the amyloid burden, and improved behavioral performance of immunized older AD mice. Here, we further determined that these anti-6Abeta15-T serum antibodies from different strains of mice displayed anti-Abeta antibody responses against the same epitopes in the Abeta1-15 region. Peripheral administration of anti-6Abeta15-T serum antibodies was also effective to mitigate AD-like pathology and cognitive decline in aged 3x Tg-AD mice. Specifically, the levels of Abeta and tau in the brains of 3x Tg-AD mice were significantly reduced after passive immunotherapy, which seemed necessary or beneficial to ameliorate memory impairment. In addition, our results showed that this immunotherapy also prevented presynaptic dynamin 1 degradation, which might help to further protect synaptic functions and allow functional recovery of cognition. Moreover, immunization with 6Abeta15-T in rabbits induced a similar antibody response as that in mice, and the rabbit serum antibodies reacted strongly with Abeta42 oligomers and inhibited oligomer-mediated neurotoxicity. We concluded that passive immunization with Abeta42 oligomer conformation-sensitive anti-6Abeta15-T serum antibodies is effective in providing potentially therapeutic effects in aged 3x Tg-AD mice by reducing Abeta and tau.
