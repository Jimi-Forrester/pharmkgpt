22533419|t|Identification and characterization of an abeta oligomer precipitating peptide that may be useful to explore gene therapeutic approaches to Alzheimer disease.
22533419|a|A key feature of Alzheimer disease (AD) is the pathologic self-association of the amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide, leading to the formation of diffusible toxic Abeta oligomers and extracellular amyloid plaques. Next to extracellular Abeta, intraneuronal Abeta has important pathological functions in AD. Agents that specifically interfere with the oligomerization processes either outside or inside of neurons are highly desired for the elucidation of the pathologic mechanisms of AD and might even pave the way for new AD gene therapeutic approaches. Here, we characterize the Abeta binding peptide L3 and its influence on Abeta oligomerization in vitro. Preliminary studies in cell culture demonstrate that stably expressed L3 reduces cell toxicity of externally added Abeta in neuroblastoma cells.
