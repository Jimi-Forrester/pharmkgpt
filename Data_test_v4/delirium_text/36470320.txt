36470320|t|Comprehensive Geriatric Hospital at Home: Adaptation to Referral and Case-Mix Changes During the COVID-19 Pandemic.
36470320|a|OBJECTIVES: To describe the evolution of a Hospital at Home (HAH) based on comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA), including its adaptability to changing case-mixes and pathways during the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: Observational study of consecutive admissions to a combined step-up (admissions from home) and step-down (hospital discharge) HAH during 3 periods: prepandemic (2018-February 2020) vs pandemic (March-December 2020, and January-December 2021). SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Participants were all consecutive patients admitted to a CGA-based HAH, located in Barcelona, Spain. Referrals followed acute events or exacerbation of chronic conditions, by either primary care (step-up) or after post-acute discharge (step-down). METHODS: HAH intervention based on CGA and incorporated geriatric rehabilitation. Patient case-mix, functional evolution (Barthel index), and mortality were compared across periods and between pathways. RESULTS: HAH capacity expanded 3 fold from 15 to 45 virtual beds and altogether managed 688 consecutive patients [mean age (SD) = 82.5 (9.6) years; 59% women]. Pandemic case-mix was slightly older (mean age = 83.5 vs 82 years, P = .012) than prepandemic, with greater mobility impairment. Across periods, step-up increased (26.1%, 40.9%, 48.2%, P < .01) because of medical events, skin ulcers, and post-acute stroke, whereas step-down decreased; multivariable models showed no differences in functional improvement or mortality. When comparing pathways, step-up featured older patients with higher comorbidity, worse functional status, and lower absolute functional gain than step-down (5.6 vs 13 points of Barthel index, P < .01), remaining statistically significant after adjusting for covariates (P = .003); no differences in mortality were observed. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: A multipurpose, step-down and step-up CGA HAH expanded its activity and adapted to changing case-mixes and pathways throughout COVID-19 pandemic waves. Although further quantitative and qualitative studies are needed to assess the impact of this model, our results suggest that harnessing the adaptability of HAH may help advance a paradigm shift toward more person-centered, cost-effective models of clinical care aimed at older adults.
