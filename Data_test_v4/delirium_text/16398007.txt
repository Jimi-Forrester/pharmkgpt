16398007|t|Alzheimer's disease: stage-related interventions.
16398007|a|Although there are different kinds of dementia, Alzheimer's Disease (AD) accounts for the largest percentage of cases in those individuals over 60 years of age. The initial presenting symptom of AD is forgetfulness. As the disease evolves, patients continue to manifest more serious cognitive deficits and to also experience difficulties associated with adaptive capabilities. For those patients who have not died of medical complications the final stage of AD is one where total care of the patient is provided by others. The task of appropriately caring for these affected elderly persons imposes enormous cognitive, physical, emotional, and financial strain on human and social resources. Factors contributing to this burden and strain are derived from the changes accompanying the patient's clinical condition and also include decisions about use of varied allocated medical, nursing, psychosocial, and community treatment and support services. The selection of appropriate services and the coordination of these diverse and fragmented providers is increasingly organized by the case manager. The purpose of this paper is to outline the progressive clinical symptomatology of AD so that case managers may more accurately link current and future patient needs with community resources.
