37834402|t|Transferrin-Conjugated Melittin-Loaded L-Arginine-Coated Iron Oxide Nanoparticles for Mitigating Beta-Amyloid Pathology of the 5XFAD Mouse Brain.
37834402|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most prevalent neurodegenerative diseases and a major contributor to dementia. Although the cause of this condition has been identified long ago as aberrant aggregations of amyloid and tau proteins, effective therapies for it remain elusive. The complexities of drug development for AD treatment are often compounded by the impermeable blood-brain barrier and low-yield brain delivery. In addition, the use of high drug concentrations to overcome this challenge may entail side effects. To address these challenges and enhance the precision of delivery into brain regions affected by amyloid aggregation, we proposed a transferrin-conjugated nanoparticle-based drug delivery system. The transferrin-conjugated melittin-loaded L-arginine-coated iron oxide nanoparticles (Tf-MeLioNs) developed in this study successfully mitigated melittin-induced cytotoxicity and hemolysis in the cell culture system. In the 5XFAD mouse brain, Tf-MeLioNs remarkably reduced amyloid plaque accumulation, particularly in the hippocampus. This study suggested Tf-LioNs as a potential drug delivery platform and Tf-MeLioNs as a candidate for therapeutic drug targeting of amyloid plaques in AD. These findings provide a foundation for further exploration and advancement in AD therapeutics.
