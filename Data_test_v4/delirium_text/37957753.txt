37957753|t|Periarticular infiltration used in total joint replacements: an update and review article.
37957753|a|Periarticular infiltration following total knee and hip arthroplasty has been demonstrated to be equivalent to peripheral nerve blocks for postoperative pain management. The ideal cocktail has not been established yet. We have conducted a literature search on PubMed and Embase. Our search criteria included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and systematic reviews (SRs). We tried to only include the most recent studies to keep the information current. The included research focused at Dexmedetomidine, Liposomal Bupivacaine, Ropivacaine, Epinephrine, Ketorolac, Morphine, Ketamine and Glucocorticosteroids. Each medication's mode of action, duration, ideal dosage, contraindications, side effects and effectiveness have been summarized in the review article. This article will help the clinician to make an informed evidence-based decision about which medications to include in their ideal cocktail.
