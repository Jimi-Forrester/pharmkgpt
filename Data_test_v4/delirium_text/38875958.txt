38875958|a|The pathogenesis of epilepsy remains unclear; however, a prevailing hypothesis suggests that the primary underlying cause is an imbalance between neuronal excitability and inhibition. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is a key enzyme in the pentose phosphate pathway, which is primarily involved in deoxynucleic acid synthesis and antioxidant defense mechanisms and exhibits increased expression during the chronic phase of epilepsy, predominantly colocalizing with neurons. G6PD overexpression significantly reduces the frequency and duration of spontaneous recurrent seizures. Furthermore, G6PD overexpression enhances signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) expression, thus influencing N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptors expression, and subsequently affecting seizure activity. Importantly, the regulation of STAT1 by G6PD appears to be mediated primarily through reactive oxygen species signaling pathways. Collectively, our findings highlight the pivotal role of G6PD in modulating epileptogenesis, and suggest its potential as a therapeutic target for epilepsy.
