27682851|a|Interfering with the activity of beta-secretase to reduce the production of Abeta peptides is a conceivable therapeutic strategy for Alzheimer's disease. However, the development of efficient yet safe inhibitors is hampered by secondary effects, usually linked to the indiscriminate inhibition of other substrates' processing by the targeted enzyme. Based on the spatial compartmentalization of the cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein by beta-secretase, we hypothesized that by exploiting the endocytosis receptor low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein it would be possible to direct an otherwise cell-impermeable inhibitor to the endosomes of neurons, boosting the drug's efficacy and importantly, sparing the off-target effects. We used the transport peptide Angiopep to build an endocytosis-competent conjugate and found that although the peptide facilitated the inhibitor's internalization into neurons and delivered it to the endosomes, the delivery was not efficient enough to potently reduce beta-secretase activity at the cellular level. This is likely connected to the finding that in the cell lines we used, Angiopep's internalization was not mediated by its presumed receptor to a significant extent. Additionally, Angiopep exploited different internalization mechanisms when applied alone or when conjugated to the inhibitor, highlighting the impact that drug conjugation can have on transport peptides.
