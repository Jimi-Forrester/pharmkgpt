25428255|a|The earliest sites of brain atrophy in Alzheimer's disease are in the medial temporal lobe, following widespread cerebral cortical amyloid deposition. We assessed 74 cognitively normal participants with clinical measurements, amyloid-beta-PET imaging, MRI, and a newly developed technique for MRI-based hippocampal subfield segmentation to determine the differential association of amyloid deposition and hippocampal subfield volume. Compared to amyloid-negative participants, amyloid-positive participants had significantly smaller hippocampal tail, presubiculum, subiculum, and total hippocampal gray matter volumes. We conclude that, prior to the development of cognitive impairment, atrophy in particular hippocampal subfields occurs preferentially with amyloid-beta accumulation.
