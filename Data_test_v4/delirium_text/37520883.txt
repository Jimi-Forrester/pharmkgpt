37520883|t|Occurrence of butyrylcholinesterase polymorphisms in patients undergoing surgery in Slovakia.
37520883|a|Background: Post-operative residual curarization is a persisting problem, characterized by muscle fatigue, exhaustion or paresis, caused by the use of neuromuscular blocking agents with prolonged postoperative effect. Genetically, determined changes in cholinesterase activity can be a major reason for persistent muscle blockade after administration of muscle relaxants. Methods: Regarding the subsistence of polymorphisms in the plasma cholinesterase gene causing change in enzyme activity and metabolism of applied drugs, we investigated the frequency of two polymorphisms known to reduce its activity significantly in patients undergoing surgery. Results: Primary results show a relatively high occurrence of plasma cholinesterase K risk allele (18.75%). Conclusion: Characterization of the lacking information about genetic background of changes in plasma cholinesterase activity within Slovakia may allow for easier decision-making in clinical practice when selecting alternative neuromuscular blocking and also reversal agents.
