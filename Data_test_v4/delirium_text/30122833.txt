30122833|t|Changing Landscapes in the Neuroimaging of Dementia.
30122833|a|Neuroimaging in dementia has advanced several folds in the past decade. It has evolved from diagnosing secondary causes of dementia to the current use in identifying primary dementia and aid in clinically perplexing situations. There has been a leap in the imaging technology that can virtually dissect the brain with a high degree of radiopathological correlation. The neuroimaging in dementia is classified into structural, functional, and molecular imaging. Structural imaging includes voxel-based morphometry and diffusion tensor imaging. Functional imaging includes 18F-fluorodeoxy glucose positron emission tomography imaging, 99mTc hexamethylpropyleneamineoxime single photon emission computed tomography imaging, and functional magnetic resonance imaging studies. Molecular imaging includes amyloid imaging, tau imaging, and translocated protein imaging. These advancements have led to using neuroimaging as a biomarker in assessing the progression and also in deciphering prognosis of the disease. In this article, we discuss the current clinical relevance of these neurological advancements.
