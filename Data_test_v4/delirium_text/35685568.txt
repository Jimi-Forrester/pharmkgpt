35685568|a|Background: Percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP) is an effective minimally invasive technique for the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral fracture (OVF) in recent years. This study focuses on the analysis of PKP surgery and anesthesia in osteoporotic vertebral facture patients over 90 years old with the concept of "enhanced recovery after surgery." Methods: This study reviewed 239 patients who were diagnosed with OVF retrospectively between October 2015 and June 2019. According to the method of anesthesia, these patients were divided into Group A (n = 125) and Group B (n = 114). According to the pedicle puncture approach, these patients were divided into Group C (n = 102) and Group D (n = 137). The anterior vertebral height (AVH) and local kyphosis angle (LKA) were used to evaluate the degree of vertebral damage and restoration. The visual analogue scale (VAS) and the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) scores were used for assessing functional outcomes. Some parameters were used to assess the perioperative conditions such as operation time, amount of bone cement perfusion, intraoperative fluoroscopy times, anesthesia recovery time, time out of the bed, hospital stay, hospitalization cost, and complications. Results: The visual analogue scale (VAS), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), anterior vertebral height (AVH), and local kyphosis angle (LKA) 1 day, 1 year after surgery, and at the last follow-up all showed significant improvement (P < 0.05) in comparison with those before surgery both in Groups A and B and Groups C and D. The ODI 1 day after surgery was significantly better in Group B than Group A (P < 0.05). Compared with Group B, Group A required longer time of anesthesia, operation time, anesthesia recovery time, time to get out of bed, and length of hospital stay and more hospitalization costs (P < 0.05). Group D required longer operation time, longer time to get out of bed, more bone cement volume, fluoroscopy time, and more operation hospitalization costs compared with Group C (P < 0.05). Conclusion: We recommend unilateral puncture under local anesthesia for OVF in the patients aged over 90 from the perspective of rapid recovery.
