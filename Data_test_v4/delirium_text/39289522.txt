39289522|a|Blood-based biomarkers of neurodegeneration demonstrate great promise for the diagnosis and prognosis of Alzheimer's disease. Ultra-sensitive plasma assays now allow for quantification of the lower concentrations in cognitively unimpaired older adults, making it possible to investigate whether these markers can provide insight also into the early neurodegenerative processes that affect cognitive function and whether the markers are influenced by modifiable risk factors. Adopting an exploratory approach in 93 healthy older adults (65-75 years), we used structural equation modelling to investigate cross-sectional associations between multiple latent cognitive abilities (working memory, episodic memory, spatial and verbal reasoning) and plasma amyloid beta (Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio), phosphorylated-tau 181 (ptau-181), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and neurofilament light (NfL), as well as the influence of device-measured habitual physical activity on these associations. The results showed that NfL was negatively associated with working memory, and that NfL interacted with moderate-to-vigorous physical activity in its association with episodic memory. The study has thereby demonstrated the potential of neurodegenerative plasma markers for improving understanding of normative cognitive aging and encourages future research to test the hypothesis that high levels of NfL, indicative of white matter pathology, limit the beneficial effect of physical activity on episodic memory in healthy aging.
