29357368|a|Migraine attacks alter various molecules that might be related to the pathophysiology of migraine, such as serotonin, calcitonin gene-related peptide, and nitric oxide. The underlying pathophysiology of migraine is as yet unclear. We explored key proteins related to the pathogenesis of migraine here. Serum was collected from two patients with migraine with aura (MA) and seven patients with migraine without aura (MO) during attack-free periods and migraine attacks. Samples were analyzed using 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Nineteen protein spots were altered between the attack-free versus migraine attack periods. Mass spectrometric analysis was performed to identify the proteins within each of the 19 altered spots. Thirty-six proteins were significantly altered in samples collected during attack-free periods versus migraine attacks. The protein with the statistically most significant MASCOT/Mowse score (268+-112) among lipoproteins was apolipoprotein (ApoE). In the MA and MO groups, ApoE protein levels were significantly higher during migraine attack than during the attack-free period (p<0.05). ApoE protein levels were also significantly increased in the MA group during the attack-free period compared to healthy controls and patients with tension type headaches (p<0.01). Migraine alters ApoE levels, especially in MA. ApoE might play an important role in the pathophysiology of migraine, and may act as a diagnostic biomarker of migraine.
