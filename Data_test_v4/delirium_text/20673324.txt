20673324|t|Persistent alveolar soft-part sarcoma with liver metastasis: a case report.
20673324|a|INTRODUCTION: Alveolar soft-part sarcomas are rare, slow-growing tumors that metastasize commonly via vascular routes to the lungs, bones, lymph nodes and brain, causing morbidity and mortality. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case describing metastasis to the liver reported from Nigeria. CASE PRESENTATION: A 57-year-old man of the Urhobo ethnic group of Nigeria presented with a persistent mass in his left calf. It was initially diagnosed as soft-tissue sarcoma, and its associated systemic effects lead to his death before a histological diagnosis could be obtained. CONCLUSIONS: Alveolar soft-part sarcoma with metastasis to the liver can occur in our region (northeast Africa), and a high index of suspicion is required to make an early diagnosis, followed by prompt surgical excision with clear margins in order to prevent mortality.
