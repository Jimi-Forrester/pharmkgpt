29065493|a|The successful preparation of a novel dimer complex formed between 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-porphyrin Fe(III) chloride and (5,10,15,20-tetraphenylporphinato) dichlorophosphorus(V) chloride using the well-known reactivity of the P-X bond is reported. The obtained complex was characterized by UV-vis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), fluorescence, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, and 31P-NMR spectroscopic techniques and also by additional Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence (HSQC) and Heteronuclear Multiple Bond Correlation (HMBC) experiments in order to correctly assign the NMR signals. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and EDX quantifications completed the characterizations. This novel porphyrin dimer complex demonstrated fluorescence sensing of H2O2 in water for low oxygen concentrations in the range of 40-90 microM proving medical relevance for early diagnosis of diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's, and even cancer because higher concentrations of H2O2 than 50 muM are consideredcytotoxic for life. Due to its optical properties, this novel metalloporphyrin-porphyrin based complex is expected to show PDT and bactericidal activity under visible-light irradiation.
