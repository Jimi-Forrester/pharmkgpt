39342323|a|Microglia-driven neuroinflammation plays an important role in the development of Alzheimer's disease. Microglia activation is accompanied by the formation and chronic expression of TLR4 inflammarafts, defined as enlarged and cholesterol-rich lipid rafts serving as an assembly platform for TLR4 dimers and complexes of other inflammatory receptors. The secreted apoA-I binding protein (APOA1BP or AIBP) binds TLR4 and selectively targets cholesterol depletion machinery to TLR4 inflammaraft-expressing inflammatory, but not homeostatic microglia. Here we demonstrated that amyloid-beta (Abeta) induced formation of TLR4 inflammarafts in microglia in vitro and in the brain of APP/PS1 mice. Mitochondria in Apoa1bp-/- APP/PS1 microglia were hyperbranched and cupped, which was accompanied by increased reactive oxygen species and the dilated endoplasmic reticulum. The size and number of Abeta plaques and neuronal cell death were significantly increased, and the animal survival was decreased in Apoa1bp-/-APP/PS1 compared to APP/PS1 female mice. These results suggest that AIBP exerts control of TLR4 inflammarafts and mitochondrial dynamics in microglia and plays a protective role in Alzheimer's disease associated oxidative stress and neurodegeneration.
