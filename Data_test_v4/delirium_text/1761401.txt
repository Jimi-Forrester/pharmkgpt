1761401|t|Immunomodulation by 9-amino-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroacridine (THA): 1. Down-regulation of natural cell-mediated cytotoxicity in vitro.
1761401|a|THA (Tacrine), a drug used in the experimental therapy of dementia of Alzheimer's disease type, and whose biochemical site of action is believed to be the neural cholinesterase, is shown, for the first time, to be an immunosuppressant in vitro on normal human peripheral blood lymphocytes in microgram quantities. THA down-regulates non-MHC restricted natural killer (NK) cell activity without affecting the general viability of cells. This down-regulation can be demonstrated at all effector and target (K562) concentrations, in purified resting NK cells as well as in lymphokine (interleukin 2) activated killer cells in 3- or 16-h NK assays and in all the blood samples tested. Kinetic analysis shows that the Vmax (maximal cytotoxic potential) and Km of NK cell-mediated cytolysis are also attenuated. Single cell assays using agarose matrix reveal that THA moderately interferes with tumor target binding/recognition events and strongly abrogates the delivery of lethal hit, thus lowering the frequency of active killer cells among THA-treated lymphocytes. THA down-regulates NK cells upon direct interaction and does not require the help of non-NK cells. The THA sensitive site(s) on NK cells does not appear to be perturbed significantly either by their proliferative status or by membrane modulations that may be normally induced by interleukin 2. The in vitro immunomodulatory pharmacological properties of THA reveal that the biological site of action of THA extends to non-neural cells also. Such non-neural models may be helpful in exploring the pathophysiological neuroimmunomodulatory properties of THA at cellular and molecular levels.
