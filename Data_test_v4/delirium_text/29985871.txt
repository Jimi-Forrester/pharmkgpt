29985871|t|Cognitive Impairment Level and Elderly Hip Fracture: Implications in Rehabilitation Nursing.
29985871|a|PURPOSE: The aim of the study was to determine the cognitive impairment level influence in descriptive characteristics, comorbidities, complications, and pharmacological features of older adults with hip fracture. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. METHOD: Five hundred fifty-seven older adults with hip fracture were recruited and divided into cognitive impairment levels (severe/moderate, mild, no impairment). Descriptive characteristics, comorbidities, complications, and pharmacological data were collected. FINDINGS: Significant differences (p < .05, R = .012-.475) between cognitive impairment levels were shown. Shorter presurgery hospital length of stay and lower depression and Parkinson comorbidities; delirium complication; and antidepressants, antiparkinsonians, and neuroleptics use were shown for the no-impairment group. With regard to the cognitive impairment groups, lower presence of cardiopathy and hypertension; higher presence of dementia; antihypertensives, antiplatelets, and antidementia medication; infection/respiratory insufficiency complications; and lower constipation complications were shown. CONCLUSION: Cognitive impairment levels may determine the characteristics, comorbidities, pharmacology, and complications of older adults with hip fracture. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Cognitive impairment level may impact rehabilitation nursing practice, education, and care coordination.
