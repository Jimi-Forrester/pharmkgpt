29784256|t|Perioperative Delirium Protocol for the Older Patient.
29784256|a|PURPOSE: Delirium is an acute change in cognition and attention. It may affect any age group. It is most common in older patients and is associated with a significant increase in mortality. The purpose of this project was to implement an assessment protocol to identify patients at risk for postoperative delirium. DESIGN: A case study approach was used. METHODS: The Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) tool for screening and diagnostic purposes was used to train surgeons, anesthesia providers, and nurses. A standardized delirium assessment and management protocol was developed and implemented. FINDINGS: The CAM and geriatric preoperative assessment was used with the patient discussed in the case study. The patient did not experience postoperative delirium and was discharged from perioperative services on the same day. CONCLUSION: Evidence informs us that early recognition and multifaceted interventions can prevent postoperative delirium in the elderly.
