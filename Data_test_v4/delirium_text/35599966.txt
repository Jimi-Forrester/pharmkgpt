35599966|t|Responsive Behaviors and Pain Management in Hospital Dementia Care: A Before and After Comparison of the "Serial Trial Intervention".
35599966|a|Purpose: Responsive behavior, often referred to as behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), is among the most critical disorders in dementia whereby nursing personnel in hospitals are increasingly confronted with such symptoms. The purpose was to reduce the level of BPSD in an acute hospital environment through a stepwise procedure followed by the initiation of a needs-oriented treatment. Methods: An open, prospective, interventional study with before-after comparisons was used to implement "Serial Trial Intervention" (STI) in three hospital wards (internal medicine, surgery, geriatric) after its adaption for hospital setting which was supplemented with a detailed pain assessment. Participants were 65 years and older. Potential causes of BPSD were clarified in a stepwise procedure and, if possible, eliminated. The primary outcome was the reduction in BPSD measured by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI-Q-12) while secondary outcomes were through the use of non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions. Results: No significant reduction in NPI-Q-12 could be found. However, significantly more mobilizations and changes of position were carried out. Higher antipsychotic use was seen in the after-groups presumably due to the higher rates of delirium and cognitive impairment. Furthermore, the data showed no increase in analgesic use. Conclusion: No significant reduction in NPI-Q-12 was observed in the before-after study. The use of antipsychotics even increased most probably due to a higher incidence of deliriousness in the after-group. However, STI seemed to improve attention to underlying causes of BPSD as well as pain. Proof that STI leads to NPI-Q-12 reduction in hospitals is still pending.
