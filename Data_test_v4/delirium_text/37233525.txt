37233525|t|Anti-Viral Surfaces in the Fight against the Spread of Coronaviruses.
37233525|a|This review is conducted against the background of nanotechnology, which provides us with a chance to effectively combat the spread of coronaviruses, and which primarily concerns polyelectrolytes and their usability for obtaining protective function against viruses and as carriers for anti-viral agents, vaccine adjuvants, and, in particular, direct anti-viral activity. This review covers nanomembranes in the form of nano-coatings or nanoparticles built of natural or synthetic polyelectrolytes--either alone or else as nanocomposites for creating an interface with viruses. There are not a wide variety of polyelectrolytes with direct activity against SARS-CoV-2, but materials that are effective in virucidal evaluations against HIV, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV are taken into account as potentially active against SARS-CoV-2. Developing new approaches to materials as interfaces with viruses will continue to be relevant in the future.
