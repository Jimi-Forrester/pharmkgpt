30538843|t|Mental Disorders in Chronic Liver Diseases with Viral Etiology.
30538843|a|The study of chronic viral hepatitis represents a real challenge for modern medicine. If we also analyze this illness from the point of the mental changes involved, the complexity of the study increases. To the etiological, symptomatological polymorphism, alongside the paraclinical and conduct diagnosis, there may be easily added the multitude of mental disorders. The authors have tried, through this paper, to draw the attention upon the importance of studying certain mental disorders connected to a somatic disease, each and every representing a distinct entity, but which together may reach a remarkable complexity.
