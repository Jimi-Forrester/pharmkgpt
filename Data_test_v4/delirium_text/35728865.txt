35728865|a|INTRODUCTION: Despite a clear association between cognitive impairment and physical frailty and poor postoperative outcomes in older adults, preoperative rates are rarely assessed. We sought to implement a preoperative cognitive impairment and frailty screening programme to meet the unique needs of our rural academic centre. METHODS: Through stakeholder interviews, we identified five primary drivers underlying screening implementation: staff education, technology infrastructure, workload impact, screening value and patient-provider communication. Based on these findings, we implemented cognitive dysfunction (AD8, Mini-Cog) and frailty (Clinical Frailty Scale) screening in our preoperative care clinic and select surgical clinics. RESULTS: In the preoperative care clinic, many of our patients scored positive for clinical frailty (428 of 1231, 35%) and for cognitive impairment (264 of 1781, 14.8%). In our surgical clinics, 27% (35 of 131) and 9% (12 of 131) scored positive for clinical frailty and cognitive impairment, respectively. Compliance to screening improved from 48% to 86% 1 year later. CONCLUSION: We qualitatively analysed stakeholder feedback to drive the successful implementation of a preoperative cognitive impairment and frailty screening programme in our rural tertiary care centre. Preliminary data suggest that a clinically significant proportion of older adults screen positive for preoperative cognitive impairment and frailty and would benefit from tailored inpatient care.
