36078042|t|Identifying Disease Signatures in the Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 1 Mouse Cortex.
36078042|a|The neurodegenerative disease spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is known to lead to the progressive degeneration of specific neuronal populations, including cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs), brainstem cranial nerve nuclei and inferior olive nuclei, and spinocerebellar tracts. The disease-causing protein ataxin-1 is fairly ubiquitously expressed throughout the brain and spinal cord, but most studies have primarily focused on the role of ataxin-1 in the cerebellum and brainstem. Therefore, the functions of ataxin-1 and the effects of SCA1 mutations in other brain regions including the cortex are not well-known. Here, we characterized pathology in the motor cortex of a SCA1 mouse model and performed RNA sequencing in this brain region to investigate the impact of mutant ataxin-1 towards transcriptomic alterations. We identified progressive cortical pathology and significant transcriptomic changes in the motor cortex of a SCA1 mouse model. We also identified progressive, region-specific, colocalization of p62 protein with mutant ataxin-1 aggregates in broad brain regions, but not the cerebellum or brainstem. A cross-regional comparison of the SCA1 cortical and cerebellar transcriptomic changes identified both common and unique gene expression changes between the two regions, including shared synaptic dysfunction and region-specific kinase regulation. These findings suggest that the cortex is progressively impacted via both shared and region-specific mechanisms in SCA1.
