24815757|t|Delirium and its prevention with melatonergic drugs.
24815757|a|Delirium is a complex neurobehavioral syndrome caused by dysregulation of brain activity, characterized by an alteration in the level of attention and awareness, which develops over a short period of time and is seen as a change from the patient's baseline. Dysregulation of 24-hour circadian cycles, including melatonin secretion or activity, has suggested the potential therapeutic use of melatonergic drugs for delirium. Melatonin and the melatonin analog drug ramelteon have been shown to be effective in the prevention of delirium in three controlled studies. Additional studies using these drugs are warranted.
