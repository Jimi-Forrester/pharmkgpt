36644414|a|Background: Staphylococcus aureus is isolated in around 0.2%-4% of positive urinary cultures, more commonly in the contexts of long-term care, urological abnormalities and procedures, male sex, older age and comorbidities. Isolation may represent contamination, colonization, urinary tract infection or bacteraemic seeding from another site, and may be linked to S. aureus bacteraemia. However, there is little guidance on investigation and management of S. aureus bacteriuria. We performed a retrospective analysis of cases in our service, including clinical characteristics, investigations and treatment. Methods: Data were collected on all urine samples taken from adult patients over a 5-year period from which S. aureus was isolated. Detailed analysis including investigations and management was conducted in those collected over a 1-year period. Results: From 511 patients, 668 urine cultures positive for S. aureus were identified; 6.5% of cases were positive for MRSA. Of 93 patients who had blood cultures taken, there were 6 cases of S. aureus bacteraemia, 4 of which were associated with urological instrumentation. Of 94 cases analysed in detail, 57% were treated with antibiotics, and 49% had repeat urine cultures. Factors associated with recurrence were urinary catheterization, urological abnormality, diabetes and inpatient status. Conclusions: Our experience does not support the routine taking of blood cultures or treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in well patients with S. aureus bacteriuria in this setting. However, repeat urine culture, and investigation and treatment of higher risk patients, for example, prior to bladder instrumentation, may be warranted. We propose a simple algorithm to guide clinicians.
