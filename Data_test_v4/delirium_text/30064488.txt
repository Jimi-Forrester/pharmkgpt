30064488|a|OBJECTIVE: Ras homolog enriched in striatum (Rhes) is a small GTP-binding protein that is predominantly localized in the striatal region of the brain. Rhes affects various signaling pathways and plays important roles in Huntington's disease development caused by striatal anomalies. However, the mechanism underlying the regulation of Rhes expression is not fully understood. We hypothesized that Rhes expression might be regulated by microRNAs (miRNAs), which are small noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression by interacting with the 3'-untranslated region (3'UTR) of mRNA. This study therefore investigated the interaction between miRNAs and the Rhes mRNA 3'UTR. RESULTS: The results of luciferase assay showed that miR-101, the miRNA determined to have the highest possibility of interacting with the Rhes mRNA 3'UTR using DIANA-microT, significantly inhibits luciferase activity, suggesting that miR-101 directly targets the Rhes mRNA 3'UTR. Additionally, Rhes protein levels in cultured cells co-transfected with a plasmid containing the complete Rhes cDNA and miR-101 were significantly downregulated by miR-101 as demonstrated by western blot analysis. These results support our hypothesis that Rhes expression is regulated by miRNA and indicate that miR-101 may be a potent modulator of Rhes expression in striatal neurons.
