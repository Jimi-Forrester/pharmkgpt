30775579|a|The anti-oxidant effects of melatonin and the immune-pineal axis are well established. However, how they play a role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases is not well elucidated. A better understanding of this neuro-immuno-endocrinological link can help in the development of novel therapies with higher efficacy to alleviate symptomatology, slow disease progression and improve the quality of life. Recent studies have shown that the immune-pineal axis acts as an immunological buffer, neurohormonal switch and it also intricately links the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases (like Multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease) and inflammation at a molecular level. Furthermore, alteration in circadian melatonin production is seen in neurodegenerative diseases. This review will summarise the mechanics by which the immune-pineal axis and neuro-immuno-endocrinological disturbances affect the pathogenesis and progression of neurodegenerative diseases. It will also explore, how this understanding will help in the development of novel hybrid melatonin hormone therapies for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.
