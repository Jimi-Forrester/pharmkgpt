33926107|t|Live Cell FRET Imaging Reveals Amyloid beta-Peptide Oligomerization in Hippocampal Neurons.
33926107|a|Amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) oligomerization is believed to contribute to the neuronal dysfunction in Alzheimer disease (AD). Despite decades of research, many details of Abeta oligomerization in neurons still need to be revealed. Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) is a simple but effective way to study molecular interactions. Here, we used a confocal microscope with a sensitive Airyscan detector for FRET detection. By live cell FRET imaging, we detected Abeta42 oligomerization in primary neurons. The neurons were incubated with fluorescently labeled Abeta42 in the cell culture medium for 24 h. Abeta42 were internalized and oligomerized in the lysosomes/late endosomes in a concentration-dependent manner. Both the cellular uptake and intracellular oligomerization of Abeta42 were significantly higher than for Abeta40. These findings provide a better understanding of Abeta42 oligomerization in neurons.
