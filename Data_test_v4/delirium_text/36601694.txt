36601694|a|The causes of the neurodegenerative processes in Alzheimer's disease (AD) are not completely known. Recent studies have shown that white matter (WM) damage could be more severe and widespread than whole-brain cortical atrophy and that such damage may appear even before the damage to the gray matter (GM). In AD, Amyloid-beta (Abeta42 ) and tau proteins could directly affect WM, spreading across brain networks. Since hippocampal atrophy is common in the early phase of disease, it is reasonable to expect that hippocampal volume (HV) might be also related to WM integrity. Our study aimed to evaluate the integrity of the whole-brain WM, through diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) parameters, in mild AD and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) due to AD (with Abeta42 alteration in cerebrospinal fluid [CSF]) in relation to controls; and possible correlations between those measures and the CSF levels of Abeta42 , phosphorylated tau protein (p-Tau) and total tau (t-Tau). We found a widespread WM alteration in the groups, and we also observed correlations between p-Tau and t-Tau with tracts directly linked to mesial temporal lobe (MTL) structures (fornix and hippocampal cingulum). However, linear regressions showed that the HV better explained the variation found in the DTI measures (with weak to moderate effect sizes, explaining from 9% to 31%) than did CSF proteins. In conclusion, we found widespread alterations in WM integrity, particularly in regions commonly affected by the disease in our group of early-stage disease and patients with Alzheimer's disease. Nonetheless, in the statistical models, the HV better predicted the integrity of the MTL tracts than the biomarkers in CSF.
