28973459|a|Functional impairment or complete loss of type VII collagen, caused by mutations within COL7A1, lead to the severe recessive form of the skin blistering disease dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB). Here, we successfully demonstrate RNA trans-splicing as an auspicious repair option for mutations located in a wide range of exons by fully converting an RDEB phenotype in an ex vivo pre-clinical mouse model based on xenotransplantation. Via a self-inactivating (SIN) lentiviral vector a 3' RNA trans-splicing molecule, capable of replacing COL7A1 exons 65-118, was delivered into type VII collagen deficient patient keratinocytes, carrying a homozygous mutation in exon 80 (c.6527insC). Following vector integration, protein analysis of an isolated corrected single cell clone showed secretion of the corrected type VII collagen at similar levels compared to normal keratinocytes. To confirm full phenotypic and long-term correction in vivo, patches of skin equivalents expanded from the corrected cell clone were grafted onto immunodeficient mice. Immunolabelling of 12 weeks old skin specimens showed strong expression of human type VII collagen restricted to the basement membrane zone. We demonstrate that the RNA trans-splicing technology combined with a SIN lentiviral vector is suitable for an ex vivo molecular therapy approach and thus adaptable for clinical application.
