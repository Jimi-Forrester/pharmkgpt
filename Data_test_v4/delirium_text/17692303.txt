DESIGN AND METHODS: To investigate the possible role of oxidative DNA damage in the pathogenesis of AD, we measured the metabolite concentrations of oxidized nucleosides (pseudouridine, 1-methyladenosine, 5-methylcytidine, 5-methyl-2'-deoxycytidine, 3-methyluridine, N(2), N(2)-dimethylguanosine, 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine, 5-deoxyadenosine and 2-deoxyguanosine) in urine between AD (n=36) and control subjects (n=34) using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) without urine preparation. RESULTS: In AD, the 3-methyluridine, 1-methyladenosine, 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (p<0.05, respectively), 2-deoxyguanosine (p<0.01) and pseudouridine, N(2), N(2)-dimethylguanosine (p<0.001, respectively) were significantly increased when compared with the control subjects. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that oxidized urinary nucleosides may be useful as biomarkers for AD in early stages.
