18706476|t|Genetic association between low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein gene polymorphisms and Alzheimer's disease in Chinese Han population.
18706476|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorders in the elderly. Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP), as a receptor of apolipoprotein E (APOE), APP, and alpha2 macroglobulin (alpha2-M), keeps the balance between degeneration and production of beta-amyloid protein (Abeta) clearance. Its gene had been defined as a candidate gene for AD, but the results were not universal. Total 496 AD patients and 478 controls were recruited in Chinese Han population and real-time PCR was used to detect the polymorphism of LRP C766T. Multiple logistic regression, Chi-square test and survival analysis were performed to explore the association. The distribution of LRP genotypes and alleles was significantly different between cases and controls, and T allele could reduce the risk for developing AD (OR of CT genotype: 0.57; 95% CI: 0.38-0.85, rho=0.003; OR of T allele: 0.57; 95% CI: 0.39-0.83, rho=0.003). TT genotype carriers had 5 years later for developing AD compared with CC genotype carriers, but survival analysis did not conform this (LRP TT vs. CT and CC log rank chi(2)=2.71, rho=0.26). The distribution of LRP C766T genotypes and alleles was different among different severity stratified by MMSE yet (rho=0.26). Our data suggested that the polymorphism of LRP C766T was strongly associated with AD and T allele might be a protective factor for AD in Chinese Han population.
