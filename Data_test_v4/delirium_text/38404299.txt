38404299|a|The ability to perceive polarization-related entoptic phenomena arises from the dichroism of macular pigments held in Henle's fiber layer of the retina and can be inhibited by retinal diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration, which alters the structure of the macula. Structured light tools enable the direct probing of macular pigment density and retinal structure through the perception of polarization-dependent entoptic patterns. Here, we directly measure the visual angle of an entoptic pattern created through the illumination of the retina with a structured state of light and a perception task that is insensitive to corneal birefringence. The central region of the structured light stimuli was obstructed, with the size of the obstruction varying according to a psychophysical staircase. Two stimuli, one producing 11 azimuthal fringes and the other three azimuthal fringes, were presented to 24 healthy participants. The pattern with 11 azimuthal fringes produced an average visual angle threshold of 10  +- 1  and a 95% confidence interval (C.I.) of [6 , 14 ]. For the pattern with three azimuthal fringes, a threshold extent of 3.6  +- 0.3  C.I. = [1.3 , 5.8 ] was measured, a value similar to the published extent of Haidinger's brush (4 ). The increase in apparent size and clarity of entoptic phenomena produced by the presented structured light stimuli offers the potential to detect the early signs of macular disease over perception tasks using uniform polarization stimuli.
