27561008|a|In relation to the recent trials of Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG) in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) it was demonstrated that different IgG preparations contain varying amounts of natural anti-amyloid beta (Abeta) antibodies as measured by ELISA. We therefore investigated the relevance of ELISA data for measuring low-affinity antibodies, such as anti-Abeta. We analysed the binding of different commercial Immunoglobulin G (IgG) preparations to Abeta, actin and tetanus toxoid in different binding assays to further investigate the possible cause for observed differences in binding to Abeta and actin between different IgG preparations. We show that the differences of commercial IgG preparations in binding to Abeta and actin in ELISA assays are artefactual and only evident in in vitro binding assays. In functional assays and in vivo animal studies the different IVIG preparations exhibited very similar potency. ELISA data alone are not appropriate to analyse and rank the binding capacity of low-affinity antibodies to Abeta or other endogenous self-antigens contained in IgG preparations. Additional analytical methods should be adopted to complement ELISA data.
