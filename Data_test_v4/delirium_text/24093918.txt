24093918|a|The accumulation and aggregation of alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) in several tissue including the brain is a major pathological hallmark in Parkinson's disease (PD). In this study, we show that alpha-syn can be taken up by primary human cortical neurons, astrocytes and skin-derived fibroblasts in vitro. Our findings that brain and peripheral cells exposed to alpha-syn can lead to impaired mitochondrial function, leading to cellular degeneration and cell death, provides additional evidence for the involvement of mitochondrial dysfunction as a mechanism of toxicity of alpha-syn in human cells.
