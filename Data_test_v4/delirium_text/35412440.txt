35412440|a|Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is a risk factor for dementia that may occur at higher rates in people with HIV (PWH). Prospective memory (PM) is an aspect of cognition that may help us better understand how SCD impacts daily life. Paricipants were 62 PWH aged >= 50 years and 33 seronegative individuals. SCD was operationalized as normatively elevated cognitive symptoms on standardized questionnaires, but with normatively unimpaired performance-based cognition and no current affective disorders. PM was measured with the Comprehensive Assessment of Prospective Memory (CAPM), the Cambridge Test of Prospective Memory (CAMPROMPT), and an experimental computerized time-based PM task. A logistic regression revealed that older PWH had a three-fold increased likelihood for SCD. Among the PWH, SCD was associated with more frequent PM symptoms and poorer accuracy on the time-based scale of the CAMPROMPT. These findings suggest that SCD disrupts PM in older PWH.
