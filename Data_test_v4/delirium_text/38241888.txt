38241888|t|Covalent immobilization of human serum albumin on cellulose acetate membrane for scavenging amyloid beta - A stepping extracorporeal strategy for ameliorating Alzheimer's disease.
38241888|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by interrupted neurocognitive functions and impaired mental development presumably caused by the accumulation of amyloid beta (Abeta) in the form of plaques. Targeting Abeta has been considered a promising approach for treating AD. In the current study, human serum albumin (HSA), a natural Abeta binder, is covalently immobilized onto the surface of a cellulose acetate (CA) membrane to devise an extracorporeal Abeta sequester. The immobilization of HSA at 3.06 +- 0.22 mug/mm2 of the CA membrane was found to be active functionally, as evidenced by the esterase-like activity converting p-nitrophenyl acetate into p-nitrophenol. The green fluorescent protein-Abeta (GFP-Abeta) fusion protein, recombinantly produced as a model ligand, exhibited characteristics of native Abeta. These features include the propensity to form aggregates or fibrils and an affinity for HSA with a dissociation constant (KD) of 0.91 muM. The HSA on the CA membrane showed concentration-dependent sequestration of GFP-Abeta in the 1-10-muM range. Moreover, it had a greater binding capacity than HSA immobilized on a commercial amine-binding plate. Results suggest that the covalent immobilization of HSA on the CA surface can be used as a potential platform for sequestering Abeta to alleviate AD.
