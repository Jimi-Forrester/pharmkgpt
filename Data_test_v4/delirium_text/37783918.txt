37783918|a|Neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, and dementia with Lewy bodies are age-related disorders and the main cause of dementia. They are characterized by the cerebral accumulation of Abeta, tau, alpha-synuclein, and TDP-43. Because the accumulation begins decades before disease onset, treatment should be started in the preclinical stage. Such intervention would be long-lasting, and therefore, prophylactic agents should be safe, non-invasively taken by the patients, and inexpensive. In addition, the agents should be broadly effective against etiologic proteins and capable of repairing neurons damaged by toxic oligomers. These requirements are difficult to meet with single-ingredient pharmaceuticals but may be feasible by taking proper diets composed of multiple ingredients. As a source of such diets, we focused on the Hawaiian native herb Mamaki. From its dried leaves and fruits, we made three preparations: hot water extract of the leaves, non-extracted simple crush powder of the leaves, and simple crush powder of the fruits, and examined their effects on the cognitive function and neuropathologies in four different mouse models of neurodegenerative dementia. Hot water extract of the leaves attenuated neuropathologies, restored synaptophysin levels, suppressed microglial activation, and improved memory when orally administered for 1 month. Simply crushed leaf powder showed a higher efficacy, but simply crushed fruit powder displayed the strongest effects. Moreover, the fruit powder significantly enhanced the levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor expression and neurogenesis, indicating its ability to repair neurons. These results suggest that crushed Mamaki leaves and fruits are promising sources of dementia-preventive diets.
