34443482|t|Synthesis, Biological Evaluation, and In Silico Studies of New Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitors Based on Quinoxaline Scaffold.
34443482|a|A quinoxaline scaffold exhibits various bioactivities in pharmacotherapeutic interests. In this research, twelve quinoxaline derivatives were synthesized and evaluated as new acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. We found all compounds showed potent inhibitory activity against acetylcholinesterase (AChE) with IC50 values of 0.077 to 50.080 microM, along with promising predicted drug-likeness and blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeation. In addition, potent butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) inhibitory activity with IC50 values of 14.91 to 60.95 microM was observed in some compounds. Enzyme kinetic study revealed the most potent compound (6c) as a mixed-type AChE inhibitor. No cytotoxicity from the quinoxaline derivatives was noticed in the human neuroblastoma cell line (SHSY5Y). In silico study suggested the compounds preferred the peripheral anionic site (PAS) to the catalytic anionic site (CAS), which was different from AChE inhibitors (tacrine and galanthamine). We had proposed the molecular design guided for quinoxaline derivatives targeting the PAS site. Therefore, the quinoxaline derivatives could offer the lead for the newly developed candidate as potential acetylcholinesterase inhibitors.
