36846288|a|Objectives: Delirium increases distress in patients and caregivers and often leads to hospitalisation and increased health-care costs. It is early diagnosis and management improves the quality of life (QoL) of advanced cancer patients as well as their families. This quality improvement (QI) project aimed at increasing delirium assessment in poor performance advanced cancer patients receiving palliative homecare. Material and Methods: The A3 methodology for QI was used. Our SMART goal was to increase the assessment of delirium in poor performance advanced cancer patients from 25% to 50%. The Fishbone and Pareto analysis helped to determine the reasons for low assessment rates. A validated screening tool for delirium assessment was selected and the homecare team doctors and nurses were trained to use it. A flier was designed to help educate families about delirium. Results: Regular use of the tool helped to increase delirium assessment from an initial 25-50% at the time of project completion. The homecare teams learnt the importance of early delirium diagnosis and the need for regular delirium screening. Family caregivers were empowered through education and use of fliers. Conclusion: The QI project helped to improve delirium assessment and leading to improved QoL of patients and their caregivers. Regular training and awareness and continued use of a validated screening tool should help to sustain the results.
