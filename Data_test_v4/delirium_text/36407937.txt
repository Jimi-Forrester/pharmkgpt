36407937|a|Introduction: Visual function and cognitive impairment are interrelated; however, little is known about the impact of modifying treatable vision impairment on the development of cognitive dysfunction. This study examines the relationship between cognition and self-reported visual function using the National Eye Institute's Visual Function Questionnaire (NEI VFQ). Methods: Participants completed the NEI VFQ 25-Item questionnaire as well as the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Additionally, all participants were assigned a consensus clinical diagnosis based on established criteria. We used a general linear model and analysis of variance approach to compare means between multiple groups. Results: A significant association between overall composite score on the NEI VFQ and total MMSE score was revealed (P = 0.04). On average, for every 1-point increase in MMSE score, the overall composite score increased by 0.40 units (95% confidence interval: 0.03-0.77). Discussion: Reduced visual function should raise concerns about cognitive decline and prompt additional assessment.
