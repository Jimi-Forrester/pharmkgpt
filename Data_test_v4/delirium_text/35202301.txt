35202301|a|Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and conditioned medium (CM) derived from human umbilical blood cord stem cells (HUBSC) are now being extensively utilized. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) have the same ability as HUBSC as an option for autologous therapy. In addition, cell therapy using HUVECs may produce protective signals for cerebral vessels and promote neuronal survival after hypoxic-ischemic damage. HUVECs have the same anatomical and physiological structure as bovine umbilical vein endothelial cells (BUVECs). In this study, we aim to determine the ability of BUVEC-CM to reduce inflammation and apoptosis on in vitro neurodegeneration models (PC12 and SH-SY5Y cell lines). BUVEC-CM obtained from the third and fourth passages were analyzed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and high-resolution mass spectrometry (HR-MS), while the other part was used as a treatment for in vitro model neurodegeneration. The PC12 and SH-SY5Y cell lines were cultured and grouped into seven different treatments, including untreated cells. As the treatment group, cells were given TMT 10 microM in the presence of different doses of CM (25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%); as a control comparison of recent therapy, donepezil was used. In addition, cells with the administration of TMT 10 microM were run as a positive control. Cell viability assay (CCK-8) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were performed to identify the viability and expression of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), caspase-3, and caspase-9 for both PC12 and SH-SY5Y cells. The results showed that BUVEC-CM could significantly reduce IL-1beta expression and downregulate caspase-3 and caspase-9, as well as when compared to the donepezil group. Taken together, these results indicate that BUVEC-CM can be used as a potential candidate for neuroprotective agents by reducing the activity of IL-1beta and the expression of caspase-9 and caspase-3 in PC12 and SH-SY5Y cells induced by TMT. However, further research still needs to be conducted.
