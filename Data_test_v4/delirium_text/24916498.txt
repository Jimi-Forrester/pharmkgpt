24916498|t|NETER 1 alcoholic 5 subtypes: Validity with Lesch four evolutionary subtypes.
24916498|a|Objective. To validate NAT (NETER's alcoholic typology), taking into account the differentiated distribution of the measures used as external criteria in alcohol-dependent sub-groups and its relationship with Lesch's alcoholic typology (LAT). Method. A sample of 133 alcohol-dependent patients integrated in the alcoholism unit of the Psychiatric Service of Santa Maria University Hospital were included in the study. Results and Conclusions. Convergent validity was assured by the agreement between the subtypes of the two typologies (NAT and Lesch), considering the same underlying model of alcoholism development: anxiopathic subtype of NAT and Type II (model of anxiety, alcohol as conflict solution) of Lesch and the tymopathic subtype of NAT and type III (model of depression, alcohol as antidepressant) of Lesch. Discriminant analysis (external criteria) showed significant differences between the subtypes in the following variables: gender; tobacco; beer and whisky consumption; daily average of drinks; clinical conditions such as delirium tremens, alcoholic blackouts and seizures; severity of alcohol-related problems; psychological dimensions such as psychological maturity and extroversion; and suicidal ideation during the alcohol consumption period. A more exhaustive description of alcoholic sub-groups may improve genetic studies of alcoholism and provide the alcoholic patient with an adequate specific therapeutic protocol.
