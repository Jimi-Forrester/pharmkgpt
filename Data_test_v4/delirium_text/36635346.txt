36635346|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia in aged population. Oxidative stress and neuroinflammation play important roles in the pathogenesis of AD. Investigation of hub genes for the development of potential therapeutic targets and candidate biomarkers is warranted. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in AD were screened in GSE48350 dataset. The differentially expressed oxidative stress genes (DEOSGs) were analyzed by intersection of DEGs and oxidative stress-related genes. The immune-related DEOSGs and hub genes were identified by weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis, respectively. Enrichment analysis was performed by Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes. The diagnostic value of hub genes was assessed by receiver operating characteristic analysis and validated in GSE1297. The mRNA expression of diagnostic genes was determined by qRT-PCR analysis. Finally, we constructed the drug, transcription factors (TFs), and microRNA network of the diagnostic genes. A total of 1160 DEGs (259 up-regulated and 901 down-regulated) were screened in GSE48350. Among them 111 DEOSGs were identified in AD. Thereafter, we identified significant difference of infiltrated immune cells (effector memory CD8 T cell, activated B cell, memory B cell, natural killer cell, CD56 bright natural killer cell, natural killer T cell, plasmacytoid dendritic cell, and neutrophil) between AD and control samples. 27 gene modules were obtained through WGCNA and turquoise module was the most relevant module. We obtained 66 immune-related DEOSGs by intersecting turquoise module with the DEOSGs and identified 15 hub genes through PPI analysis. Among them, 9 hub genes (CCK, CNR1, GAD1, GAP43, NEFL, NPY, PENK, SST, and TAC1) were identified with good diagnostic values and verified in GSE1297. qRT-PCR analysis revealed the downregulation of SST, NPY, GAP43, CCK, and PENK and upregulation of NEFL in AD. Finally, we identified 76 therapeutic agents, 152 miRNAs targets, and 91 TFs regulatory networks. Our study identified 9 key genes associated with oxidative stress and immune reaction in AD pathogenesis. The findings may help to provide promising candidate biomarkers and therapeutic targets for AD.
