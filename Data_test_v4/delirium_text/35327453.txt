35327453|t|Hypouricemia and Urate Transporters.
35327453|a|Hypouricemia is recognized as a rare disorder, defined as a serum uric acid level of 2.0 mg/dL or less. Hypouricemia is divided into an overexcretion type and an underproduction type. The former typical disease is xanthinuria, and the latter is renal hypouricemia (RHUC). The frequency of nephrogenic hypouricemia due to a deficiency of URAT1 is high in Japan, accounting for most asymptomatic and persistent cases of hypouricemia. RHUC results in a high risk of exercise-induced acute kidney injury and urolithiasis. It is vital to promote research on RHUC, as this will lead not only to the elucidation of its pathophysiology but also to the development of new treatments for gout and hyperuricemia.
