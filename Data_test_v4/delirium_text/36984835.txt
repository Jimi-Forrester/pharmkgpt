36984835|a|Injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a product of gut bacteria, into the blood increases blood triglycerides and cortisol, an appetite-stimulating hormone. Meanwhile, small amounts of LPS derived from gut bacteria are thought to enter the bloodstream from the gut in daily basis. This study aimed to investigate the effect of LPS influx on appetite or lipid metabolism in humans in everyday life. We measured the fasting plasma LPS concentration before breakfast and the corresponding days' appetite and fat-burning markers for 10 days in four Japanese males (28-31 years) and analyzed the correlation of their inter-day variation. The LPS concentration was negatively correlated with fullness, and positively correlated with the carbohydrate intake. Against our hypothesis, the LPS concentration was positively correlated with the fasting breath acetone concentration, a fat-burning marker. There was a positive correlation between the LPS concentration and fasting body mass index (BMI), but the inter-day variation in BMI was slight. The results suggest that the LPS influx in everyday life is at least associated with appetite in the day.
