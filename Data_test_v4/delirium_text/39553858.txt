39553858|t|Multimodal photoacoustic microscopy and optical coherence tomography ocular biomarker imaging in Alzheimer's disease in mice.
39553858|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by amyloid beta (Abeta)-containing extracellular plaques and tau-containing intracellular neurofibrillary tangles. Reliable and more accessible biomarkers along with associated imaging methods are essential for early diagnosis and to develop effective therapeutic interventions. Described here is an integrated photoacoustic microscopy (PAM) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) dual-modality imaging system for multiple ocular biomarker imaging in an AD mouse model. Anti-Abeta-conjugated Au nanochains (AuNCs) were engineered and administered to the mice to provide molecular contrast of Abeta. The retinal vasculature structure and Abeta deposition in AD mice and wild-type (WT) mice were imaged simultaneously by dual-wavelength PAM. OCT distinguished significant differences in retinal layer thickness between AD and WT animals. With the unique ability of imaging the multiple ocular biomarkers via a coaxial multimodality imaging system, the proposed system provides a new tool for investigating the progression of AD in animal models, which could contribute to preclinical studies of AD.
