37700926|t|COVID-19 and Malignancy: What is the Association? A Case Report and Review of the Literature.
37700926|a|Background: After more than two years since Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first identified as a global pandemic, we still observe a variety of clinical presentations. From asymptomatic carriers to severely ill patients. Most patients infected with COVID-19 present with respiratory symptoms. Objective: However, case reports of different presentations were published, none of them highlighted the potential of COVID-19 to facilitate the manifestation of hidden malignancy, particularly, gallbladder carcinoma. Case presentation: In this report, we present a case of a 77-year-old Saudi lady with multiple comorbidities, presented with an acute confusional state after one month of having asymptomatic COVID-19 infection. Significantly, she was completely functional prior to her presentation and did not manifest any symptoms such as weight loss or fever. Her clinical assessment demonstrated severe abdominal tenderness and guarding on palpation. Computed tomography scans of the abdomen showed perforated gallbladder cancer. Conclusion: Among multiple clinical presentations related to COVID-19 infection, gastrointestinal manifestations are the most common extrapulmonary symptoms, ranging from mild to more severe symptoms. Acute abdomen with perforated viscus should be kept in mind as a differential diagnosis when dealing with COVID-19 infected patients who present with severe abdominal pain. The current case report highlights one of unusual presentations of COVID-19 infection.
