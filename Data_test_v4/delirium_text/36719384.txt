36719384|t|Understanding Neuropeptide Transmission in the Brain by Optical Uncaging and Release.
36719384|a|Neuropeptides are abundant and essential signaling molecules in the nervous system involved in modulating neural circuits and behavior. Neuropeptides are generally released extrasynaptically and signal via volume transmission through G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR). Although substantive functional roles of neuropeptides have been discovered, many questions on neuropeptide transmission remain poorly understood, including the local diffusion and transmission properties in the brain extracellular space. To address this challenge, intensive efforts are required to develop advanced tools for releasing and detecting neuropeptides with high spatiotemporal resolution. Because of the rapid development of biosensors and materials science, emerging tools are beginning to provide a better understanding of neuropeptide transmission. In this perspective, we summarize the fundamental advances in understanding neuropeptide transmission over the past decade, highlight the tools for releasing neuropeptides with high spatiotemporal solution in the brain, and discuss open questions and future directions in the field.
