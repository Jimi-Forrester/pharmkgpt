36585063|a|BACKGROUND: During the initial phase of the pandemic, we identified a critical gap in the Military Health System's access to palliative care. Our team of nurse scientists and evidence-based practice (EBP) facilitators aimed to develop and implement an evidence-based point of care palliative care toolkit for frontline workers in inpatient settings lacking established palliative care specialists. METHODOLOGY: We utilized Melnyk and Fineout-Overholt's (2018) seven-step EBP process. Six central themes were derived from 17 publications providing an evidence-base for toolkit resource selection and development. Our practice change implementation was piloted at a large West Coast military treatment facility. We included iPads in the toolkit for patient communication and palliative mobile application use. RESULTS: The most significant finding was the critical and continued need for basic palliative care education and training. Integrating the palliative care toolkit into daily practice was promising yet challenging due to the high volume of deployed medical staff.
