15739845|t|Clinical utility of color-form naming in Alzheimer's disease: preliminary evidence.
15739845|a|Performances on Alzheimer's Quick Test color-form naming and Mini-Mental State Examination were compared for 38 adults with Alzheimer's disease and 38 age- and sex-matched normal controls. Group means differed significantly and indicated longer naming times by adults with Alzheimer's disease. The specificity for AQT color-form naming was 97% and sensitivity 97%, i.e., 3% false negatives. The specificity for Mini-Mental State Examination was 100% and sensitivity 84%, i.e., 16% false negatives. These findings, while supporting AQT color-form naming as a screening test for reductions in cognitive speed associated with Alzheimer's disease, are preliminary given the relatively small sample.
