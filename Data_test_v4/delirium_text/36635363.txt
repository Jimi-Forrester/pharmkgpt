36635363|a|The aim of the present work is the evaluation of biological effects of natural stilbenoids found in Vitis vinifera, with a focus on their activity as epigenetic modulators. In the present study, resveratrol, pterostilbene and for the first time their dimers (+-)-trans-delta-viniferin, (+-)-trans-pterostilbene dehydrodimer were evaluated in Caco-2 and HepG-2 cell lines as potential epigenetic modulators. Stilbenoids were added in a Caco-2 cell culture as a model of the intestinal epithelial barrier and in the HepG-2 as a model of hepatic environment, to verify their dose-dependent toxicity, ability to interact with DNA, and epigenomic action. Resveratrol, pterostilbene, and (+-)-trans-pterostilbene dehydrodimer were found to have no toxic effects at tested concentration and were effective in reversing arsenic damage in Caco-2 cell lines. (+-)-trans-delta-viniferin showed epigenomic activity, but further studies are needed to clarify its mode of action.
