35896592|a|There is growing evidence that surgery can drive an inflammatory response in the brain. However, the mechanisms behind this response are incompletely understood. Here, we investigate the hypotheses that 1. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytokines increase after vascular surgery and 2. That these changes in CSF cytokines are interrelated. Patients undergoing either open or endovascular elective surgery of the thoracic aorta were invited to participate in this study. Cerebrospinal fluid samples were taken before surgery and on the first post-operative day. These were analysed for the presence of ten cytokines by immunoassay to examine for post-operative changes in cytokine levels. After surgery, there were significant increases in six out of the ten measured CSF cytokines (IL-1beta, 2, 6, 8, 10 and 13). This included changes in both putative pro-inflammatory (IL-1beta, 6 and 8) and putative anti-inflammatory (IL-2, 10 and 13) cytokines. The greatest increases occurred in IL-6 and IL-8, which showed a 63-fold and a 31-fold increase respectively. There was strong intercorrelation between CSF cytokines after the operation. Following surgery on the thoracic aorta, there was a marked increase in CSF cytokines, consistent with a potential role in neuroinflammation. The ten measured cytokines showed intercorrelation after the operation, indicating that a balance between multiple pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines may be present.
