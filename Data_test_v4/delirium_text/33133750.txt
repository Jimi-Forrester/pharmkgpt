33133750|t|Emergence Delirium: Can Corticosteroids Contribute to It?
33133750|a|We report a case of emergence delirium after a propofol-based sedation for a renal biopsy in a teenager patient who had received high-dose and long-term corticosteroid treatment. Corticosteroid treatment is proposed as a possible risk factor for emergence delirium, although controlled studies are needed to assess this relationship. Although treatment for emergence delirium has not been well established, as described with steroid-induced psychiatric symptoms, antipsychotics could be a good therapeutic option.
