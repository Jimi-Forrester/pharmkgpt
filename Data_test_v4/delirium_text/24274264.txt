24274264|t|Label-free voltammetric detection of MicroRNAs at multi-channel screen printed array of electrodes comparison to graphite sensors.
24274264|a|The multi-channel screen-printed array of electrodes (MUX-SPE16) was used in our study for the first time for electrochemical monitoring of nucleic acid hybridization related to different miRNA sequences (miRNA-16, miRNA-15a and miRNA-660, i.e, the biomarkers for Alzheimer disease). The MUX-SPE16 was also used for the first time herein for the label-free electrochemical detection of nucleic acid hybridization combined magnetic beads (MB) assay in comparison to the disposable pencil graphite electrode (PGE). Under the principle of the magnetic beads assay, the biotinylated inosine substituted DNA probe was firstly immobilized onto streptavidin coated MB, and then, the hybridization process between probe and its complementary miRNA sequence was performed at MB surface. The voltammetric transduction was performed using differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) technique in combination with the single-use graphite sensor technologies; PGE and MUX-SPE16 for miRNA detection by measuring the guanine oxidation signal without using any external indicator. The features of single-use sensor technologies, PGE and MUX-SPE16, were discussed concerning to their reproducibility, detection limit, and selectivity compared to the results in the earlier studies presenting the electrochemical miRNA detection related to different miRNA sequences.
