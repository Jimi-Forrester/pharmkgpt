27977539|t|Delirium in Children After Cardiac Bypass Surgery.
27977539|a|OBJECTIVES: To describe the incidence of delirium in pediatric patients after cardiac bypass surgery and explore associated risk factors and effect of delirium on in-hospital outcomes. DESIGN: Prospective observational single-center study. SETTING: Fourteen-bed pediatric cardiothoracic ICU. PATIENTS: One hundred ninety-four consecutive admissions following cardiac bypass surgery, 1 day to 21 years old. INTERVENTIONS: Subjects were screened for delirium daily using the Cornell Assessment of Pediatric Delirium. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Incidence of delirium in this sample was 49%. Delirium most often lasted 1-2 days and developed within the first 1-3 days after surgery. Age less than 2 years, developmental delay, higher Risk Adjustment for Congenital Heart Surgery 1 score, cyanotic disease, and albumin less than three were all independently associated with development of delirium in a multivariable model (all p < 0.03). Delirium was an independent predictor of prolonged ICU length of stay, with patients who were ever delirious having a 60% increase in ICU days compared with patients who were never delirious (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: In our institution, delirium is a frequent problem in children after cardiac bypass surgery, with identifiable risk factors. Our study suggests that cardiac bypass surgery significantly increases children's susceptibility to delirium. This highlights the need for heightened, targeted delirium screening in all pediatric cardiothoracic ICUs to potentially improve outcomes in this vulnerable patient population.
