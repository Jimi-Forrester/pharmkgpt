37082580|a|Mammalian nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) were initially discovered as ligand-gated ion channels mediating fast synaptic transmission in the neuro-muscular junctions and autonomic ganglia. They were further found to be involved in a wide range of basic biological processes within the brain and in non-excitable tissues. The present review summarizes the data obtained in our laboratory during last two decades. Investigation of autonomic ganglia with the nAChR subunit-specific antibodies was followed by identification of nAChRs in B lymphocytes, discovery of mitochondrial nAChRs and their role in mitochondrial apoptosis pathway, and revealing the role of alpha7 nAChRs and alpha7-specific antibodies in neuroinflammation-related Alzheimer disease and COVID-19. The data obtained demonstrate the involvement of nAChRs in cell survival, proliferation, cell-to-cell communication and inflammatory reaction. Together with the ability of nAChRs to function in both ionotropic and metabotropic way, these data illustrate the universal nature of cholinergic regulation mediated by nAChRs.
