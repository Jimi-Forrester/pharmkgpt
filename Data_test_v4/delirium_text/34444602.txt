34444602|t|Non-Pharmacological Nursing Interventions for Prevention and Treatment of Delirium in Hospitalized Adult Patients: Systematic Review of Randomized Controlled Trials.
34444602|a|Delirium is a common neurobehavioral complication in hospitalized patients that can occur in the acute phase and lead to poor long-term outcomes. The purpose of this study was to identify non-pharmacological nursing interventions for the prevention and treatment of delirium in hospitalized adult patients. We conducted a systematic review to synthesize the findings of published studies. We searched the PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library CENTRAL databases for randomized controlled trials in January 2021. We report this systematic review according to the PRISMA 2009 checklist. The study was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42021226538). Nine studies were systematically reviewed for non-pharmacological nursing interventions for the prevention and treatment of delirium. The types of non-pharmacological nursing interventions included multicomponent intervention, multidisciplinary care, multimedia education, music listening, mentoring of family caregivers concerning delirium management, bright light exposure, ear plugs, and interventions for simulated family presence using pre-recorded video messages. These results could help nurses select and utilize non-pharmacological nursing interventions for the prevention and treatment of delirium in clinical nursing practice.
