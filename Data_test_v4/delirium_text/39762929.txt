39762929|t|Aging with HIV: The Burden of Comorbidities, Polypharmacy, and Drug Interactions in Korean People Living with HIV Aged >=50 Years.
39762929|a|BACKGROUND: The life expectancy of people living with human immunodeficiency virus (PLWH) has significantly improved with advancements in antiretroviral therapy (ART). However, aging PLWH face a growing burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), polypharmacy, and drug-drug interactions (DDIs), which pose challenges in their management. This study investigates the prevalence of NCDs, polypharmacy, and DDIs among PLWH aged >=50 years in Korea and their impact on quality of life (QOL). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 243 PLWH aged >=50 years receiving ART for at least three months at three university hospitals in Korea between January and July 2022. Data were collected through electronic medical records and personal interviews, assessing demographics, comorbidities, polypharmacy, ART adherence, and QOL using the Korean version of WHOQOL-HIV BREF scale. Potential DDIs were analyzed using the University of Liverpool HIV Drug Interaction Database, and potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs) were identified using the 2023 American Geriatrics Society Beers Criteria. We classified participants into three age groups: 50-<65 years, 65-<75 years, and >=75 years. RESULTS: The prevalence of comorbidities was 71.6%, with older participants (>=75 years) showing a significantly higher burden, including bone diseases, osteoarthritis, and dementia (P<0.001). Polypharmacy was observed in 28.4% of participants and increased with age, with 53.3% of those aged >=75 years taking >=10 pills daily. Polypharmacy was associated with poorer QOL (71.6 vs. 76.6, P=0.010). Amber-flag DDIs were found in 81 participants (33.3%), most commonly involving metformin and divalent cations. No red-flag DDIs were identified. PIMs were observed in 6.6% of participants aged >=65 years. CONCLUSION: Aging PLWH in Korea face significant challenges from comorbidities, polypharmacy, and DDIs, which negatively impact QOL. Integrated, age-specific, and multidisciplinary care strategies are urgently needed to improve outcomes and ensure the well-being of older PLWH.
