34334080|t|Dexmedetomidine improves oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) -induced neurological injury through regulating SNHG11/miR-324-3p/VEGFA axis.
34334080|a|Dexmedetomidine (Dex) has been reported to exhibit neuroprotective effects through various regulatory mechanisms. This study aims to investigate the role and molecular mechanism of SNHG11 in Dex-mediated neuroprotection. The ischemic stroke (IS) model was established in vivo by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and in vitro by oxygen-glucose deprivation and reperfusion (OGD/R)-treated SH-SY5Y. SNHG11 was highly expressed after OGD/R, and Dex improved OGD/R-induced neurological injury. Additionally, Dex reversed the effects of SNHG11 on OGD/R-induced neurological injury. Furthermore, we found that SNHG11 upregulated vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) expression by targeting miR-324-3p. Through rescue assays, it was confirmed that SNHG11 regulated OGD/R-induced neurological injury through increasing VEGFA expression. At last, Dex was also discovered to improve neurological injury through regulating SNHG11 in the rat model. In conclusion, our work demonstrated that Dex improved OGD/R-induced neurological injury via SNHG11/miR-324-3p/VEGFA axis. These findings may offer a novel therapeutic strategy for IS treatment.
