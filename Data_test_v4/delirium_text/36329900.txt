36329900|a|During prenatal life, exposure to synthetic glucocorticoids (SGCs) can alter normal foetal development, resulting in disease later in life. Previously, we have shown alterations in the dendritic cytoarchitecture of Purkinje cells in adolescent rat progeny prenatally exposed to glucocorticoids. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these alterations remain unclear. A possible molecular candidate whose deregulation may underlie these changes is the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and neurotrophin 3/ tropomyosin receptor kinase C, neurotrophic complex (NT-3/TrkC), which specifically modulates the development of the neuronal connections in the cerebellar vermis. To date, no evidence has shown that the cerebellar expression levels of this neurotrophic complex are affected by exposure to a synthetic glucocorticoid in utero. Therefore, the first objective of this investigation was to evaluate the expression of GR, NT-3 and TrkC in the cerebellar vermis using immunohistochemistry and western blot techniques by evaluating the progeny during the postnatal stage equivalent to adolescence (postnatal Day 52). Additionally, we evaluated anxiety-like behaviours in progeny using the elevated plus maze and the marble burying test. In addition, an environmental enrichment (EE) can increase the expression of some neurotrophins and has anxiolytic power. Therefore, we wanted to assess whether an EE reversed the long-term alterations induced by prenatal betamethasone exposure. The major findings of this study were as follows: i) prenatal betamethasone (BET) administration decreases GR, NT-3 and TrkC expression in the cerebellar vermis ii) prenatal BET administration decreases GR expression in the cerebellar hemispheres and iii) enhances the anxiety-like behaviours in the same progeny, and iv) exposure to an EE reverses the reduced expression of GR, NT-3 and TrkC in the cerebellar vermis and v) decreases anxiety-like behaviours. In conclusion, an enriched environment applied 18 days post-weaning was able to restabilize GR, NT-3 and TrkC expression levels and reverse anxious behaviours observed in adolescent rats prenatally exposed to betamethasone.
