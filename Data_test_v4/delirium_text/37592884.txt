37592884|t|Distinct Patterns of Hippocampal Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease with TDP-43.
37592884|a|OBJECTIVE: Age-related dementia syndromes are often not related to a single pathophysiologic process, leading to multiple neuropathologies found at autopsy. An amnestic dementia syndrome can be associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) with comorbid TDP-43 pathology (AD/TDP). Here, we investigated neuronal integrity and pathologic burden of TDP-43 and tau along the well-charted trisynaptic hippocampal circuit [dentate gyrus (DG), CA3, and CA1] in participants with amnestic dementia due to AD/TDP, amnestic dementia due to AD alone, or non-amnestic dementia due to TDP-43 proteinopathy associated with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD-TDP). METHODS: Forty-eight extensively characterized cases (14 AD, 16 AD/TDP, 18 FTLD-TDP) were analyzed using digital HALO software (Indica Labs) to quantify pathologic burden and neuronal loss. RESULTS: In AD/TDP and FTLD-TDP, TDP-43 immunoreactivity was greatest in the DG. Tau immunoreactivity was significantly greater in DG and CA3 in AD/TDP compared to pure AD. All clinical groups showed the highest amounts of neurons in DG, followed by CA3, then CA1. The AD and AD/TDP groups showed lower neuronal counts compared to the FTLD-TDP group across all hippocampal subregions consistent with the salience of the amnestic phenotype. INTERPRETATION: We conclude that AD/TDP can be distinguished from AD and FTLD-TDP based on differential regional distributions of hippocampal tau and TDP-43. Findings suggest that tau aggregation in AD/TDP may be enhanced by TDP-43. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
