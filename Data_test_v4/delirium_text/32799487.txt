32799487|t|Copper Bis(thiosemicarbazonato)-stilbenyl Complexes That Bind to Amyloid-beta Plaques.
32799487|a|Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the presence of extracellular amyloid-beta plaques. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with tracers radiolabeled with positron-emitting radionuclides that bind to amyloid-beta plaques can assist in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. With the goal of designing new imaging agents radiolabeled with positron-emitting copper-64 radionuclides that bind to amyloid-beta plaques, a family of bis(thiosemicarbazone) ligands with appended substituted stilbenyl functional groups has been prepared. The ligands form charge-neutral and stable complexes with copper(II). The new ligands can be radiolabeled with copper-64 at room temperature. Two lead complexes were demonstrated to bind to amyloid-beta plaques present in post-mortem brain tissue from subjects with clinically diagnosed Alzheimer's disease and crossed the blood-brain barrier in mice. The work presented here provides strategies to prepare compounds with radionuclides of copper that can be used for targeted brain PET imaging.
