8321588|t|Diagnosis of multi-infarct dementia: predictive value of clinical criteria.
8321588|a|Clinical and neuroimaging features that best discriminated a multi-infarct dementia diagnosis from a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease were retrospectively reviewed for 192 patients of a university-based dementia diagnostic clinic. Only a subset of features usually ascribed to multi-infarct dementia actually distinguished that diagnosis from the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.
