METHODS: Thirty male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly allocated to three groups: the normal control group; the Cup group, in which Cup was administrated at a dose of 450 mg/kg per day orally via gastric gavage for 5 weeks; and the Cup + LC group, which received the same dose of Cup as the Cup group, except that the rats were treated additionally with LC 100 mg/kg/day orally for 5 weeks. The nerve conduction (NCV) in isolated sciatic nerves was measured; then, the sciatic nerves were isolated for H&E staining and electron microscope examination. The expression of myelin basic protein (MBP), IL-1beta, p53, iNOS, and NF-KB by immunohistochemistry was detected in the isolated nerves. A PCR assay was also performed to detect the expression of antioxidant genes Nrf2 and HO-1. In addition, the level of IL-17 was measured by ELISA. RESULTS: There was a significant reduction in NCV in the Cup group compared to normal rats (p < 0.001), which was significantly improved in the LC group (p < 0.001). EM and histopathological examination revealed significant demyelination and deterioration of the sciatic nerve fibers, with significant improvement in the LC group. The level of IL-17 as well as the expression of IL-1beta, p53, iNOS, and NF-KB were significantly increased, with significant reduction expression of MBP in the sciatic nerves (p < 0.01), and LC treatment significantly improved the studied parameters (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: The current study demonstrates a neuroprotective effect of LC in a Cup-induced demyelinating rat model. This effect might be due to its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant actions.
