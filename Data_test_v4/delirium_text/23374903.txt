23374903|a|Oral glucocorticoids have been used for several decades and psychiatric side-effects may occur. This review will discuss relevant data of the clinical specificities, the incidence, the risk factors for the occurrence of these episodes and the preventive and curative medications of these episodes. We performed a literature review by using PubMed database. We selected and discussed articles and studies with high standard of evidence. The occurrence of psychiatric symptoms is quite frequent. The varying intensity of clinical features ranges from minor signs (impregnation) to acute psychotic episodes which may occur from 5 to 30% of patients. Affective symptoms or disorders are the most prominent clinical features. Delirium may occur and suicidal risk could be increased. The significant predictive factors are prednisone dosage more than 40 mg/day, particularly weight-based dosage, and a history of psychiatric disorders. When a reduced dosage of glucocorticoids is not sufficient to control the symptomatology, curative medication is mainly based on atypical antipsychotics such as olanzapine. Studies about neuropsychiatric complications of glucocorticoids present various and heterogeneous results. Further prospective clinical studies should be based on a close cooperation between physicians and consultation liaison psychiatrists. This collaboration is required for an optimized management of the patient who receive glucocorticoids.
