37371420|t|Functional and Structural Brain Abnormalities and Clinical Characteristics of Male Patients with Alcohol Dependence.
37371420|a|Even though many previous studies have reported structural or functional brain abnormalities in patients with alcohol dependence (ADPs), studies observing the structural and functional abnormalities associated with the clinical characteristics of ADPs utilizing a multimodal approach are still scarce. The aim of this study was to demonstrate structural and functional brain abnormalities and their association with the clinical characteristics of alcoholism in male ADPs. Fifteen healthy male controls (HCs) and 15 male ADPs who had been diagnosed according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5 criteria underwent T1-weighted imaging and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. The MRI data were postprocessed using statistical parametric mapping for structural analysis and CONN-fMRI functional connectivity (FC) tools for functional analysis. In comparison with male HCs, male ADPs were characterized by significantly reduced volumes of the white matter in the left globus pallidus (GP) (p-FDR < 0.05). This region affected the altered resting-state FC patterns in male ADPs. Interestingly, an abnormal FC in the precuneus and its positive correlation with the alcohol-use disorder identification test score were observed in ADPs (r = 0.546, p = 0.036). Based on the observations, it could be concluded that the GP serves as a neural marker that impacts abnormal functional networks in men with alcohol dependence. These findings have important clinical implications as they provide insights into the neural mechanism underlying the anatomical, functional, and clinical features of alcoholism.
