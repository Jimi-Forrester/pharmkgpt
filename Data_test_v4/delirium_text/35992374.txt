35992374|t|Promising effects of emoxypine and its succinate derivative in the management of various diseases-with insights on recent patent applications.
35992374|a|Emoxypine and its succinate derivative share a common hydroxypridine structure, which is similar to pyridoxine. These compounds have been utilized therapeutically and industrially, owing to the wide range of properties offered. This includes antihypoxic, neuroprotective and cardioprotective effects, along with pharmacokinetic benefits such as the ability to cross the blood brain barrier (BBB), owing to its relatively small size and low molecular weight. It was observed that emoxypine exhibited iron chelating property in vitro, indicating its usage as a promising therapeutic strategy in the management of neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), as well as hematologic disorders like thalassemia and hemochromatosis. In addition to this, it has been observed to exert a potent antioxidant effect, therefore, it may be considered for the amelioration of disorders resulting from free radical injury. Studies on its mechanism of action and implications on cellular and molecular levels would help to further the understanding of its benefits, as well as prospects for filing patents for novel applications. The primary focus of this review is to shed light on the broad spectrum of pharmacological properties offered by emoxypine and its succinate derivative, and to highlight the scope for an increased number of pre-clinical and clinical trials to assess its safety and efficacy. In addition to this, the highlights of this article include the recent patents filed and scope for novel applications of these agents.
