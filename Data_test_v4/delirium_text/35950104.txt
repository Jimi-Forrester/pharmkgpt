35950104|a|Background: GJ-4 is extracted from Gardenia jasminoides J. Ellis (Fructus Gardenia) with crocin composition and has been demonstrated to improve memory deficits in several dementia models in our previous studies. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the effects of GJ-4 on hyperlipidemic vascular dementia (VD) and explore the underlying mechanisms. Design: In the current study, we employed a chronic hyperlipidemic VD rat model by permanent bilateral common carotid arteries occlusion (2-VO) based on high-fat diet (HFD), which is an ideal model to mimic the clinical pathogenesis of human VD. Results: Our results showed that GJ-4 could significantly reduce serum lipids level and improve cerebral blood flow in hyperlipidemic VD rats. Additionally, treatment with GJ-4 remarkedly ameliorated memory impairment and alleviated neuronal injury. Mechanistic investigation revealed that the neuroprotective effects of GJ-4 might be attributed to the inhibition of microglia-mediated neuro-inflammation via regulating the M1/M2 polarization. Our data further illustrated that GJ-4 could regulate the phenotype of microglia through activating the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) and subsequently inhibited nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) nuclear translocation and increased CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta (C/EBPbeta) expression. Conclusion: Our results implied that GJ-4 might be a promising drug to improve VD through the regulation of microglial M1/M2 polarization and the subsequent inhibition of neuro-inflammation.
