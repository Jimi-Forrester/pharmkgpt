32376378|t|The Incidence and Predictors of Postoperative Delirium After Brain Tumor Resection in Adults: A Cross-Sectional Survey.
32376378|a|BACKGROUND: Postoperative delirium (POD) describes a multifactorial disease process occurring after surgery. However, few studies have focused on patients undergoing brain tumor resection, and its influencing factors are unclear. METHODS: We performed a 1-year, single-center, cross-sectional, retrospective survey at Huashan Hospital. Patients were screened using the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU), Confusion Assessment Method, and Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale by trained bedside nurses. Perioperative data were collected using demographic and disease-related questionnaires. The primary outcome measures were the incidence of POD and subtype of POD. Independent predictors of POD were estimated from multivariate logistic regression models, and receiver operating characteristic analysis was used to compare the predictive performance of the models. RESULTS: Of the 916 patients included in the study, 893 were analyzed. The overall incidence was 14.78%, 67 had hyperactive delirium (50.76%), 55 had hypoactive delirium (41.67%), and 10 had mixed delirium (7.57%). Age, sex, working status, tobacco use history, comorbidities, physical restraint, axillary temperature (>38.5 C), electrolyte disturbances, duration of anesthesia, pathologic diagnosis, tumor site, length of disease, and duration of operation were risk factors for POD. Conversely, saddle area mass was a protective factor. Age, tobacco use history, electrolyte disturbances, physical restraint, and duration of operation were included in the model. CONCLUSIONS: POD is harmful to patients undergoing brain tumor resection, increasing length of stay in the intensive care unit and hospitalization costs. Intraoperative factors and postoperative factors, in addition to older age and tobacco use history, are associated with POD.
