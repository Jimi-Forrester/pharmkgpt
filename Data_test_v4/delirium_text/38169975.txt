38169975|a|Background: Postoperative delirium (POD) is of great concern as a complication of surgery in older adult patients. Sedation strategies influence the development of POD. This study compared how sedation strategies administered during spinal anesthesia influenced POD in patients aged >=65 years undergoing elective surgery for hip fracture repair. Patients and Methods: A randomized clinical trial was conducted from 1 August 2021 to 30 June 2022 at a single academic medical center. Two hundred and twenty-six patients were randomly divided into four groups: lighter sedation with propofol (LP), heavier sedation with propofol (HP), lighter sedation with dexmedetomidine (LD), and heavier sedation with dexmedetomidine (HD). The incidence of delirium was the primary outcome and was assessed daily by the blinded Confusion Assessment Method. Results: There was a significant association between dexmedetomidine (LD+HD group) and a lower incidence of delirium (11.9% [13/109] vs the propofol group (23.6% [26/110]; Risk ratio, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.274 to 0.929; p=0.024). In the propofol group, heavier sedation had a higher rate of POD (32.7% [18/55] vs the lighter sedation group (14.5% [8/55]; Risk ratio, 2.25; 95% CI, 1.069 to 4.736; p=0.025). Conclusion: Dexmedetomidine was associated with a lower incidence of delirium than that with propofol among older patients with hip fractures. In patients that received propofol, heavier sedation was associated with high incidence of POD.
