31928968|t|Takotsubo cardiomyopathy triggered by delirium tremens in a cirrhotic patient with acute-on-chronic liver failure: A case report.
31928968|a|A 64-year-old cirrhotic woman was admitted for alcoholic hepatitis associated with renal failure. Subsequently, she displayed symptoms of alcohol withdrawal progressing to delirium tremens. During hospitalization, she developed acute respiratory distress. The electrocardiogram showed diffuse anteroseptal ST elevation. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed systolic left ventricular apical balloon-like dilation, hypokinesis of the left ventricular mid- and apical segments, and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 30%. Coronary angiography was normal and led to the diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. This report describes a singular case of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy precipitated by delirium tremens in a cirrhotic patient with acute-on-chronic liver failure.
