38769534|a|BACKGROUND: Miscarriage is a frustrating complication of pregnancy that is common among women of reproductive age. Insufficient decidualization which not only impairs embryo implantation but disturbs fetomaternal immune-tolerance, has been widely regarded as a major cause of miscarriage; however, the underlying mechanisms resulting in decidual impairment are largely unknown. METHODS: With informed consent, decidual tissue from patients with spontaneous abortion or normal pregnant women was collected to detect the expression profile of UCHL1. Human endometrial stromal cells (HESCs) were used to explore the roles of UCHL1 in decidualization and dNK modulation, as well as the mechanisms involved. C57/BL6 female mice (7-10 weeks old) were used to construct pregnancy model or artificially induced decidualization model to evaluate the effect of UCHL1 on mice decidualization and pregnancy outcome. RESULTS: The Ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCHL1), as a deubiquitinating enzyme, was significantly downregulated in decidua from patients with miscarriage, along with impaired decidualization and decreased dNKs. Blockage of UCHL1 led to insufficient decidualization and resultant decreased expression of cytokines CXCL12, IL-15, TGF-beta which were critical for generation of decidual NK cells (dNKs), whereas UCHL1 overexpression enhanced decidualization accompanied by increase in dNKs. Mechanistically, the promotion of UCHL1 on decidualization was dependent on its deubiquitinating activity, and intervention of UCHL1 inhibited the activation of JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway, resulting in aberrant decidualization and decreased production of cytokines associated with dNKs modulation. Furthermore, we found that inhibition of UCHL1 also disrupted the decidualization in mice and eventually caused adverse pregnancy outcome. CONCLUSIONS: UCHL1 plays significant roles in decidualization and dNKs modulation during pregnancy in both humans and mice. Its deficiency indicates a poor pregnancy outcome due to defective decidualization, making UCHL1 a potential target for the diagnosis and treatment of miscarriage.
