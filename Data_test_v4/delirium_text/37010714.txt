37010714|t|Identification of Bone Metastatic and Prognostic Alternative Splicing Signatures in Prostate Adenocarcinoma.
37010714|a|As the most common nonepithelial malignancy, prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD) is the fifth chief cause of cancer mortality in men. Distant metastasis often occurs in advanced PRAD and most patients are dying from it. However, the mechanism of PRAD progression and metastasis is still unclear. It's widely reported that more than 94% of genes are selectively splicing in humans and many isoforms are particularly related with cancer progression and metastasis. Spliceosome mutations occur in a mutually exclusive manner in breast cancer, and different components of spliceosomes are targets of somatic mutations in different types of breast cancer. Existing evidence strongly supports the key role of alternative splicing in breast cancer biology, and innovative tools are being developed to use splicing events for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. In order to identify if the PRAD metastasis is associated with alternative splicing events (ASEs), the RNA sequencing data and ASEs data of 500 PRAD patients were retrieved from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and TCGASpliceSeq databases. By Lasso regression, five genes were screened to construct the prediction model, with a good reliability by ROC curve. Additionally, results in both univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis confirmed the well prognosis efficacy of the prediction model (both P < 0.001). Moreover, a potential splicing regulatory network was established and after multiple-database validation, we supposed that the signaling axis of HSPB1 up-regulating the PIP5K1C - 46,721 - AT (P < 0.001) might mediate the tumorigenesis, progression and metastasis of PRAD via the key members of Alzheimer's disease pathway (SRC, EGFR, MAPT, APP and PRKCA) (P < 0.001).
