21321391|a|Amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP) is a ubiquitously expressed glycoprotein, which under physiological conditions can be cleaved following two alternative routes; the non-amyloidogenic and the amyloidogenic pathway. Shift of AbetaPP processing in favor of the amyloidogenic pathway is a key event in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Among the factors that regulate AbetaPP processing, nerve growth factor (NGF) appears to play an important role; abnormal NGF signaling has been implicated in the onset of AD. In the present study, we used PC12 cells to study the effects of NGF on AbetaPP processing and provide evidence that NGF, through binding to its high affinity receptor, TrkA moderately down-regulates the expression of the beta-secretase beta-site AbetaPP cleaving enzyme-1 and, most importantly, upregulates the expression of two enzymes with alpha-secretase activity, a disintegrin and metalloprotease-17 and to a greater extent matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9) in a phosphoinositide kinase-3 dependent manner. Finally, we demonstrate that MMP9 actively participates in NGF-induced alpha-secretase cleavage of AbetaPP, thus it contributes to the shift of AbetaPP processing towards the non-amyloidogenic pathway precluding the formation of neurotoxic Abeta peptides.
