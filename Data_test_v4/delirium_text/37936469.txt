37936469|a|INTRODUCTION: Crocin is one of the main components of Crocus sativus L. and can alleviate oxidative stress and inflammation in diabetic nephropathy (DN). However, the specific mechanism by which crocin treats DN still needs to be further elucidated. METHOD: In the present study, a mouse model of DN was first established to investigate the therapeutic effect of crocin on DN mice. Subsequently, non-targeted metabolomics techniques were used to analyze the mechanisms of action of crocin in the treatment of DN. The effects of crocin on CYP4A11/PPARgamma and TGF-beta/Smad pathway were also investigated. RESULT: Results showed that crocin exhibited significant therapeutic and anti-inflammatory, and anti-oxidative effects on DN mice. In addition, the non-targeted metabolomics results indicated that crocin treatment affected several metabolites in kidney. These metabolites were mainly associated with biotin metabolism, riboflavin metabolism, and arachidonic acid metabolism. Furthermore, crocin treatment upregulated the decreased levels of CYP4A11 and phosphorylated PPARgamma, and reduced the increased levels of TGF-beta1 and phosphorylated Smad2/3 in the kidneys of DN mice. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, our study validated the considerable therapeutic, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidative impacts of crocin on DN mice. The mechanism of crocin treatment may be related to the regulation of biotin riboflavin and arachidonic acid metabolism, the activation of CYP4A11/PPARgamma pathway, and the inhibition of TGF-beta/Smad pathway in the kidney.
