31975911|a|This article reviews the current evidence base for biomarkers of the most common causes of dementia in later life: Alzheimer's disease (AD), frontotemporal lobar degenerations, Lewy body dementias, and vascular cognitive impairment and dementia. Biomarkers are objectively measurable indicators of normal physiology, pathological processes, or response to an intervention. Ideally, they are sensitive, specific, easy to obtain, and closely reflect the underlying biological processes of interest. While such markers are well established and in broad clinical use for common disorders in general medicine (e.g., thallium stress tests for coronary artery disease or serum blood urea nitrogen and creatinine for renal failure), analogous, validated markers for AD or other common dementias are limited, although biomarkers in research settings and specialty dementia clinics are progressing toward clinical use. By way of introducing current and future biomarkers for dementias of later life, this article will benefit the practicing clinician by increasing awareness of the availability and utility of current and emerging biomarkers in dementia diagnosis and prognosis and for monitoring new disease-modifying therapeutics that arrive in the clinic over the coming decade.
