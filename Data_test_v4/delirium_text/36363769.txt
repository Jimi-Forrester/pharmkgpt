36363769|t|Cardiovascular Complications in Community-Acquired Pneumonia.
36363769|a|Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is accountable for high mortality in both pediatric and adult populations worldwide, about one-third of hospitalized patients pass away within a year of being discharged from the facility. The high mortality and morbidity rates are closely related to cardiovascular complications that are consequent or concomitant to the acute episode of pneumonia. An updated perspective on the major pathophysiological mechanisms, prevalence, risk factors, outcomes, and relevant treatments of cardiovascular events in CAP patients is provided in the current study. It is possible to evaluate the pathophysiology of cardiac disease in this population based on plaque-related events, such as acute myocardial infarction, or events unrelated to plaque, such as arrhythmias and heart failure. With an absolute rate of cardiovascular problems ranging broadly from 10% to 30%, CAP raises the risk of both plaque-related and plaque-unrelated events. Both in- and out-patients may experience these issues at admission, throughout hospitalization, or even up to a year following discharge. At long-term follow-up, cardiac events account for more than 30% of deaths in CAP patients, making them a significant cause of mortality. If patients at risk for cardiac events are stratified, diagnostic tools, monitoring, and preventive measures may be applied to these patients. A prospective evaluation of cardioprotective treatments is urgently required from a research point of view.
