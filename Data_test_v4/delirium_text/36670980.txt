36670980|t|Promising Molecular Targets in Pharmacological Therapy for Neuronal Damage in Brain Injury.
36670980|a|The complex etiopathogenesis of brain injury associated with neurodegeneration has sparked a lot of studies in the last century. These clinical situations are incurable, and the currently available therapies merely act on symptoms or slow down the course of the diseases. Effective methods are being sought with an intent to modify the disease, directly acting on the properly studied targets, as well as to contribute to the development of effective therapeutic strategies, opening the possibility of refocusing on drug development for disease management. In this sense, this review discusses the available evidence for mitochondrial dysfunction induced by Ca2+ miscommunication in neurons, as well as how targeting phosphorylation events may be used to modulate protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activity in the treatment of neuronal damage. Ca2+ tends to be the catalyst for mitochondrial dysfunction, contributing to the synaptic deficiency seen in brain injury. Additionally, emerging data have shown that PP2A-activating drugs (PADs) suppress inflammatory responses by inhibiting different signaling pathways, indicating that PADs may be beneficial for the management of neuronal damage. In addition, a few bioactive compounds have also triggered the activation of PP2A-targeted drugs for this treatment, and clinical studies will help in the authentication of these compounds. If the safety profiles of PADs are proven to be satisfactory, there is a case to be made for starting clinical studies in the setting of neurological diseases as quickly as possible.
