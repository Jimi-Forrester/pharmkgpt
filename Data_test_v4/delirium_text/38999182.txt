38999182|t|Assessing the Effects of Thiazole-Carboxamide Derivatives on the Biophysical Properties of AMPA Receptor Complexes as a Potential Neuroprotective Agent.
38999182|a|An optimal balance between excitatory and inhibitory transmission in the central nervous system provides essential neurotransmission for good functioning of the neurons. In the neurology field, a disturbed balance can lead to neurological diseases like epilepsy, Alzheimer's, and Autism. One of the critical agents mediating excitatory neurotransmission is alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid receptors, which are concerned with synaptic plasticity, memory, and learning. An imbalance in neurotransmission finally results in excitotoxicity and neurological pathologies that should be corrected through specific compounds. Hence, the current study will prove to be an evaluation of new thiazole-carboxamide derivatives concerning AMPAR-modulating activity and extended medicinal potential. In the current project, five previously synthesized thiazole-carboxamide derivatives, i.e., TC-1 to TC-5, were used to interact with the AMPARs expressed in HEK293T cells, which overexpress different subunits of the AMPAR. Patch-clamp analysis was carried out while the effect of the drugs on AMPAR-mediated currents was followed with a particular emphasis on the kinetics of inhibition, desensitization, and deactivation. All tested TC compounds, at all subunits, showed potent inhibition of AMPAR-mediated currents, with TC-2 being the most powerful for all subunits. These compounds shifted the receptor kinetics efficiently, mainly enhancing the deactivation rates, and hence acted as a surrogate for their neuroprotective potentials. Additionally, recently published structure-activity relationship studies identified particular substituent groups as necessary for improving the pharmacologic profiles of these compounds. In this regard, thiazole-carboxamide derivatives, particularly those classified as TC-2, have become essential negative allosteric modulators of AMPAR function and potential therapeutics in neurological disturbances underlain by the dysregulation of excitatory neurotransmission. Given their therapeutic effectiveness and safety profiles, these in vivo studies need to be further validated, although computational modeling can be further developed for drug design and selectivity. This will open possibilities for new drug-like AMPAR negative allosteric modulators with applications at the clinical level toward neurology.
