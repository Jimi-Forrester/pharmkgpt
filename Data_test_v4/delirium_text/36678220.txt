36678220|a|The molecular pathogenesis of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) includes a complex interaction of metabolic stress and inflammatory stimuli. Considering the therapeutic goals of NASH, it is important to determine whether the treatment can prevent the progression from NASH to hepatocellular carcinoma. Taxifolin, also known as dihydroquercetin, is a natural bioactive flavonoid with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties commonly found in various foods and health supplement products. In this study, we demonstrated that Taxifolin treatment markedly prevented the development of hepatic steatosis, chronic inflammation, and liver fibrosis in a murine model of NASH. Its mechanisms include a direct action on hepatocytes to inhibit lipid accumulation. Taxifolin also increased brown adipose tissue activity and suppressed body weight gain through at least two distinct pathways: direct action on brown adipocytes and indirect action via fibroblast growth factor 21 production in the liver. Notably, the Taxifolin treatment after NASH development could effectively prevent the development of liver tumors. Collectively, this study provides evidence that Taxifolin shows pleiotropic effects for the treatment of the NASH continuum. Our data also provide insight into the novel mechanisms of action of Taxifolin, which has been widely used as a health supplement with high safety.
