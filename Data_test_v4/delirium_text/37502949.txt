37502949|t|Multiprotein Assemblies, Phosphorylation and Dephosphorylation in Neuronal Cytoskeleton.
37502949|a|Filament systems are comprised of fibrous and globular cytoskeletal proteins and are key elements regulating cell shape, rigidity, and dynamics. The cellular localization and assembly of neurofilaments depend on phosphorylation by kinases. The involvement of the BRCA1 (Breast cancer associated protein 1)/BARD1 (BRCA1-associated RING domain 1) pathways in Alzheimer disease (AD) is suggested by colocalization studies. In particular, BRCA1 accumulation within neurofibrillary tangles and colocalization with tau aggregates in the cytoplasm of AD patients implicates the involvement of mutant forms of BRCA1/BARD1 proteins in disease pathogenesis. The purpose of this study is to show that the location of mutations in the translated BARD1, specifically within ankyrin repeats, has strong correlation with the Cdk5 motifs for phosphorylation. Mapping of the mutation sites on the protein's three-dimensional structure and estimation of the backbone dihedral angles show transitions between the canonical helical and extended conformations of the tetrapeptide sequence of ankyrin repeats. Clustering of mutations in BARD1 ankyrin repeats near the N-termini of the helices with T/SXXH motifs provides a basis for conformational transitions that might be necessary to ensure the compatibility of the substrate with active site geometry and accessibility of the substrate to the kinase. Ankyrin repeats are interaction sites for phosphorylation-dependent dynamic assembly of proteins including those involved in transcription regulation and signaling, and present potential targets for the design of new drugs.
