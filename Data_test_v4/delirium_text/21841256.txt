21841256|a|17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 10 (HSD10) deficiency is a rare X-linked inborn error of isoleucine catabolism. Although this protein has been genetically implicated in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis, studies of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) in patients with HSD10 deficiency have not been previously reported. We found, in a severely affected child with HSD10 deficiency, undetectable levels of Abeta in the cerebrospinal fluid, together with low expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, alpha-synuclein, and serotonin metabolites. Confirmation of these findings in other patients would help elucidating mechanisms of synaptic dysfunction in this disease, and highlight the role of Abeta in both early and late periods of life.
