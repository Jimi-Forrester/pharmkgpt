34090750|a|The nosological entity of the cerebral venous thrombosis caused by the SARS-CoV-2 vaccination differs from the common cerebral venous thrombosis in that it is due to immune thrombocytopenia triggered by vaccination. Cerebral venous thrombosis is one of several manifestations of this type of immune thrombocytopenia. Albeit many general aspects of management of cerebral venous thrombosis are similar, immune thrombocytopenia requires a specific therapeutic approach, which is not normally adopted for cerebral venous thrombosis due to other causes, therefore its early recognition is essential.
