The purpose of the present study was to investigate the bioactive components of its seeds and the potential mechanisms of antioxidant activity to provide a foundation for further developmental work on R. tanguticum seeds as a functional food. METHODS: In this study, the antioxidant activities of R. tanguticum seeds were measured using DPPH, ABTS and FRAP assays. LC-Q-TOF/MS was used to identify the active compounds in the seeds, and Swiss Target Prediction was used to identify their potential targets. The DisGENET, DrugBank, OMIM and GeneCard databases were used to search for antioxidant-related targets. RESULTS: The component-target-pathway network was constructed and included 5 compounds and 9 target genes. The hub genes included ESR1, APP, MAPK8, HSP90AA1, AKT1, MMP2, PTGS2, TGFB1 and JUN. The antioxidant activity signaling pathways of the compounds for the treatment of diseases were the cancer signaling pathway, estrogen signaling pathway, colorectal cancer signaling pathway, MAPK signaling pathway, etc. Molecular docking revealed that the compounds in R. tanguticum seeds could inhibit potential targets (AKT1, ESR1 and PTGS2). CONCLUSION: Molecular docking studies revealed that the binding energy score between liriodenine and PTGS2 was the highest (8.16), followed by that of chrysophanol (7.10). This result supports the potential for PTGS2-targeted drug screening and design.
