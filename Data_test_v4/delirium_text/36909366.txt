36909366|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative condition that is pathologically characterized by the presence of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Animal models of AD have been useful in understanding the disease process and in investigating the effects of compounds on pathology and behavior. APP/PS1 mice develop amyloid plaques and show memory impairment. Cyclic glycine-proline (cGP) is a cyclic dipeptide that is likely produced from a tripeptide, glycine-proline-glutamate, which itself is generated after proteolytic cleavage of insulin-like growth factor-1. Here, we show that cGP improves spatial memory and reduces amyloid plaque burden in APP/PS1 mice. The results thus suggest that cGP could potentially provide beneficial effects in AD.
