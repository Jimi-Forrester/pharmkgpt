36012172|t|Biochemical Hazards during Three Phases of Assisted Reproductive Technology: Repercussions Associated with Epigenesis and Imprinting.
36012172|a|Medically assisted reproduction, now considered a routine, successful treatment for infertility worldwide, has produced at least 8 million live births. However, a growing body of evidence is pointing toward an increased incidence of epigenetic/imprinting disorders in the offspring, raising concern that the techniques involved may have an impact on crucial stages of early embryo and fetal development highly vulnerable to epigenetic influence. In this paper, the key role of methylation processes in epigenesis, namely the essential biochemical/metabolic pathways involving folates and one-carbon cycles necessary for correct DNA/histone methylation, is discussed. Furthermore, potential contributors to epigenetics dysregulation during the three phases of assisted reproduction: preparation for and controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH); methylation processes during the preimplantation embryo culture stages; the effects of unmetabolized folic acid (UMFA) during embryogenesis on imprinting methyl "tags", are described. Advances in technology have opened a window into developmental processes that were previously inaccessible to research: it is now clear that ART procedures have the potential to influence DNA methylation in embryonic and fetal life, with an impact on health and disease risk in future generations. Critical re-evaluation of protocols and procedures is now an urgent priority, with a focus on interventions targeted toward improving ART procedures, with special attention to in vitro culture protocols and the effects of excessive folic acid intake.
