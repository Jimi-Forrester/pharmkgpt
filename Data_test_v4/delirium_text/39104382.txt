39104382|a|There has been little progress in reducing the incidence and mortality of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Prevention of onset, more accurate diagnostic tools, and prediction of health outcomes have all been identified as critical issues, but more and better basic research approaches are needed. The single greatest risk factor associated with AD is aging. It follows that if aging can be delayed, there should be an equivalent delay or even prevention of the onset of AD neuropathology. Therefore, targeting multiple pathways of aging would be a powerful way to enhance resilience to aging and slow or prevent the onset of AD neuropathology and dementia in a personalized manner. More effective and predictive animal models, such as the aging pet cat that spontaneously develops neuropathology similar to human AD patients, are necessary to help validate noninvasive and inexpensive biomarkers for identifying individuals at risk. Resilience to aging and its ability to delay or prevent the onset of age-related diseases should be the focus for preventing brain aging and enhancing resistance to AD.
