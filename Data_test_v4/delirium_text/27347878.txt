27347878|t|Possible Predictors of Involuntary Weight Loss in Patients with Alzheimer's Disease.
27347878|a|Loss in body mass ( BM) is a common feature in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the etiology of this phenomenon is unclear. The aim of this cohort study was to observe possible  BM in AD patients following a standard institutionalized diet. Secondary objective was to identify possible predictors of  BM. To this end, 85 AD patients (age: 76+-4 yrs; stature: 165+-3 cm; BM: 61.6+-7.4 kg; mean+-standard deviation) and 86 controls (CTRL; age: 78+-5 yrs; stature: 166+-4 cm; BM: 61.7+-6.4 kg) were followed during one year of standard institutionalized diet (~1800 kcal/24h). BM, daily energy expenditure, albuminemia, number of medications taken, and cortisolism, were recorded PRE and POST the observation period. Potential predictors of  BM in women (W) and men (M) with AD were calculated with a forward stepwise regression model. After one year of standard institutionalized diet, BM decreased significantly in AD (-2.5 kg; p < 0.01), while in CTRL remained unchanged (-0.4 kg; p = 0.8). AD patients and CTRL exhibited similar levels of daily energy expenditure (~1625 kcal/24h). The combination of three factors, number of medications taken, albuminemia, and cortisolism, predicted  BM in W with AD. At contrary, the best predictor of  BM in M with AD was the cortisolism. Despite a controlled energy intake and similar energy expenditure, both W and M with AD suffered of  BM. Therefore, controlled diet did not prevent this phenomenon. The assessments of these variables may predict W and M with AD at risk of weight loss.
