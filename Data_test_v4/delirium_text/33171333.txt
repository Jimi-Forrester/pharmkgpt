33171333|t|Discharge from hospital with newly administered antipsychotics after intensive care unit delirium - Incidence and contributing factors.
33171333|a|PURPOSE: Delirium in the intensive care unit (ICU) is often treated with haloperidol or atypical antipsychotics. Antipsychotic treatment can lead to severe adverse effects and excess mortality. After initiation in the ICU, patients are at risk of having their antipsychotics continued unnecessarily at ICU and hospital discharge. This study aims to determine the incidence of, and risk factors for antipsychotic continuation at hospital discharge after ICU delirium. METHODS: This retrospective observational study was performed in a tertiary care center. Adult patients who received antipsychotics for ICU delirium during 2016 were included. Data was extracted from patient records. After univariate testing, a multivariate binary logistic regression model was used to identify independent risk factors for antipsychotic continuation. RESULTS: A total of 196 patients were included, of which 104 (53.1%) and 41 (20.9%) had their antipsychotics continued at ICU and hospital discharge respectively. Medical ICU admission (odds ratio [95% confidence interval] 2.97 [1.37-6.41]) and quetiapine treatment (5.81 [1.63-20.83]) were independently associated with antipsychotic continuation at hospital discharge. CONCLUSIONS: Approximately one in five patients were discharged from the hospital with continued antipsychotics. Hospital policies should implement strategies for systematic antipsychotic tapering and better follow-up of antipsychotics at transitions of care.
