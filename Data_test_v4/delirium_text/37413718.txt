37413718|t|Orexin receptor antagonists versus antipsychotics for the management of delirium in intensive care unit patients with cardiovascular disease: A retrospective observational study.
37413718|a|OBJECTIVE: Although antipsychotics are often used in the pharmacological treatment of delirium, recent reports suggest the efficacy of orexin receptor antagonists. This study investigated whether orexin receptor antagonists could be a possible treatment option for delirium. METHOD: A nonblinded nonrandomized routine clinical treatment was performed. Patients treated in intensive care units (ICU) for cardiovascular disease and receiving psychiatric intervention were studied retrospectively. The scores from the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC) were compared between patients treated with orexin receptor antagonists and those treated with antipsychotics. RESULTS: The mean (standard deviation) ICDSC scores were 4.5 (1.8) at day -1 and 2.6 (2.6) at day 7 for orexin receptor antagonist group (n = 25) and 4.6 (2.4) at day -1 and 4.1 (2.2) at day 7 for antipsychotic group (n = 28). The orexin receptor antagonist group showed significantly lower ICDSC scores than the antipsychotic group (p = 0.021). CONCLUSION: While precise efficacy cannot be determined from our retrospective, observational, and uncontrolled pilot study, this analysis encourages a future double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial of orexin-antagonists for delirium treatment.
