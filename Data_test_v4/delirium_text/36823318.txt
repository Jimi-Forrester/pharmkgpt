36823318|a|Identification of therapeutic targets from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) requires insights into downstream functional consequences. We harmonized 8,613 RNA-sequencing samples from 14 brain datasets to create the MetaBrain resource and performed cis- and trans-expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) meta-analyses in multiple brain region- and ancestry-specific datasets (n <= 2,759). Many of the 16,169 cortex cis-eQTLs were tissue-dependent when compared with blood cis-eQTLs. We inferred brain cell types for 3,549 cis-eQTLs by interaction analysis. We prioritized 186 cis-eQTLs for 31 brain-related traits using Mendelian randomization and co-localization including 40 cis-eQTLs with an inferred cell type, such as a neuron-specific cis-eQTL (CYP24A1) for multiple sclerosis. We further describe 737 trans-eQTLs for 526 unique variants and 108 unique genes. We used brain-specific gene-co-regulation networks to link GWAS loci and prioritize additional genes for five central nervous system diseases. This study represents a valuable resource for post-GWAS research on central nervous system diseases.
