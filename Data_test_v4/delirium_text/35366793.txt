35366793|a|BACKGROUND: Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in physiological and pathological processes. However, no studies have been conducted on the relationship between lncRNAs and renal aging. RESULTS: First, we evaluated the histopathology of young (3-month-old) and old (24-month-old) C57BL/6J mouse kidneys. Masson trichrome staining and PAS staining showed interstitial collagen deposition and fibrosis, mesangial matrix expansion, a thicker basement membrane and renal interstitial fibrosis in old mouse kidneys. Senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-beta-gal)-positive areas in the kidneys of old mice were significantly elevated compared to those of young mice. Then, we analyzed the differential expression of lncRNAs and mRNAs in the kidneys of young and old mouse kidneys by RNA-seq analysis. 42 known and 179 novel differentially expressed lncRNAs and 702 differential mRNAs were detected in the mouse kidney. Next, we focused on the differentially expressed mRNAs and lncRNAs by RNA-seq. GO and KEGG analyses were performed based on differentially expressed mRNAs between young and old mouse kidneys. Transregulation based on RIsearch and the correlation coefficient of mRNA-lncRNA were also calculated. The mRNA-lncRNA network was constructed by choosing a Spearman correlation coefficient > 0.9 or <-0.9. GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses revealed that differentially expressed mRNAs participated in aging-related pathways. A total of 10 lncRNAs and trans-regulated mRNAs were constructed. Finally, we validated the role of lncRNA Gm43360 by CCK-8, flow cytometry, western blot and SA-beta-gal staining. The expression level of Adra1a was positively correlated and Csnk1a1 was negatively correlated with lncRNA Gm43360. The cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) results showed that lncRNA Gm43360 promoted cell viability. LncRNA Gm43360 increased the percentage of S phase cells and decreased the percentage of G1 phase cells compared with the negative control. LncRNA Gm43360 decreased the expression of p53, p21 and SA-beta-gal. CONCLUSIONS: LncRNA Gm43360 may play a protective role in kidney aging.
