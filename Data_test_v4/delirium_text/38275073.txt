38275073|a|Facile synthetic procedures and broad spectrum of biological activities are special attributes of sulfonamides. Sulfonamide derivatives have demonstrated potential as a class of compounds for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent sulfonamide derivatives have been reported as prospective anti-AD agents, with a focus on analogues that significantly inhibit the function of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) enzymes and exhibit remarkable antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, all of which are critical for the treatment of AD. Sulfonamide- mediated activation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2), a key regulator of the endogenous antioxidant response, has also been suggested as a potential therapeutic approach in AD. Additionally, it has been discovered that a number of sulfonamide derivatives show selectivity for the beta- and gamma-secretase enzymes and a significant reduction of amyloid B (Abeta) aggregation, which have been implicated in AD. The comparative molecular docking of benzenesulfonamide and donepezil, an AD reference drug showed comparable anti-AD activities. These suggest that sulfonamide derivatives may represent a new class of drugs for the treatment of AD. Thus, the current review will focus on recent studies on the chemical synthesis and evaluation of the anti-AD properties, molecular docking, pharmacological profile, and structure-activity relationship (SAR) of sulfonamide derivatives, as well as their potential anti-AD mechanisms of action. This paper offers a thorough assessment of the state of the art in this field of study and emphasizes the potential of sulfonamide derivatives synthesized during the 2012-2023 period as a new class of compounds for the treatment of AD.
