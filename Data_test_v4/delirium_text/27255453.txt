27255453|a|Maternal smoking during pregnancy is associated with low birth weight, increased risk of stillbirth, conduct disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and neurocognitive deficits. Ventral tegmental area dopamine (DA) neurons in the mesocorticolimbic pathway were suggested to play a critical role in these pathological mechanisms induced by nicotine. Nicotine-mediated changes in genetic expression during pregnancy are of great interest for current researchers. We used patch clamp methods to identify and harvest DA and non-DA neurons separately and assayed them using oligonucleotide arrays to elucidate the alterations in gene expressions in these cells upon gestational nicotine exposure. Microarray analysis identified a set of 135 genes as significantly differentially expressed between DA and non-DA neurons. Some of the genes were found to be related to neurological disease pathways, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease. Significantly up-/down-regulated genes found in DA neurons were mostly related to G-protein-coupled protein receptor signaling and developmental processes. These alterations in gene expressions may explain, partially at least, the possible pathological mechanisms for the diseases induced by maternal smoking.
