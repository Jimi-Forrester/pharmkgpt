28526147|t|Pharmacologic Considerations of Anesthetic Agents in Geriatric Patients.
28526147|a|Aging is a natural process of declining organ function and reserve. Census data show that the geriatric population is expected to grow to nearly 30%. More than half of geriatric patients have 1 or more surgical procedures in their lifetimes. Moreover, this is the population at greatest risk of morbidity and mortality with any given complication. There is remarkable variability in health across the age spectrum, from fit to frail and compromised. This variability requires a unique approach to anesthetic delivery and drug dosing on an individual basis to avoid complications such as postoperative cognitive dysfunction and delirium.
