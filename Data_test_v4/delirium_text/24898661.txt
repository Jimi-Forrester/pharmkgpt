Investigations of this early phase are hampered by the lack of cellular or animal models reflecting this scenario. We used SH-SY5Y cells stably transfected with an additional copy of the human AbetaPP gene and artificial aging by complex I inhibition. These cells show slightly elevated Abeta levels, moderately decreased ATP levels, impaired mitochondrial membrane potential, and decreased mitochondrial respiration. Assessing mitochondrial dynamics with three different methods reveals a distinct shift toward mitochondrial fission and fragmentation in SH-SY5Y AbetaPPwt cells. We also performed electron cryo-tomography of isolated mitochondria to reveal that there were no major differences between SH-SY5Y control and SH-SY5Y AbetaPPwt mitochondria with respect to swelling or loss of cristae. Dystrophic neurites are an early pathological feature of AD. Interestingly, SH-SY5Y AbetaPPwt cells exhibit significantly longer neurites, likely due to substantially elevated levels of sAbetaPPalpha. Complex I inhibition also shows substantial effects on mitochondrial dynamics, impairs neuritogenesis, and elevates Abeta levels in both cell types. In SH-SY5Y AbetaPPwt cells, these defects were more pronounced due to a relatively elevated Abeta and a reduced sAbetaPPalpha production. Our findings suggest that the progression from low Abeta levels to the beginning of AD takes place in the presence of oxidative stress during normal aging. This mechanism not only results from additive effects of both mechanisms on mitochondrial function but might also be additionally aggravated by altered amyloidogenic processing.
