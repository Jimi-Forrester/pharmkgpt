11974389|t|Agitation. How to manage behavior disturbances in the older patient with dementia.
11974389|a|Behavior disturbances are common among persons with dementia and can be clinically challenging to manage. Delusions and hallucinations, aggression and combativeness, sleep disorders, anxiety, and depression--collectively characterized as agitation--are among the commonly occurring behavioral problems affecting persons with dementia. Agitation can be precipitated by undiagnosed medical problems or pain, drug interactions, environmental or social triggers (unpleasant experiences, overstimulation, unwanted care), poor sleep, delirium, and depression. Effective management involves behavioral assessment and pharmacotherapy with antipsychotics (neuroleptics), antidepressants, and mood stabilizers.
