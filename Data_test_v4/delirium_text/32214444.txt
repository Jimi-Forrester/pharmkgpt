32214444|t|Intravenous Olanzapine in a Critically Ill Patient: An Evolving Route of Administration.
32214444|a|Purpose: The purpose of the article is to describe the successful use of parenteral olanzapine intravenously (IV) in a critically ill patient with severe agitated delirium. Summary: A 70-year-old man was admitted to the medical intensive care unit requiring plasmapheresis with platelet counts consistently below 20 000/microL secondary to thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). The patient had experienced agitated delirium requiring treatment, which was complicated by electrocardiogram (EKG) findings of a prolonged QTc interval. The antipsychotics the patient was receiving were believed to be responsible and, as such, the team desired an option that would have a lesser chance of worsening QTc (baseline-corrected QT) interval. Olanzapine was chosen and given IV versus the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved parenteral route of intramuscular (IM) due to concern of bleeding. The patient's delirious state responded to treatment to varying degrees and showed no increase in EKG abnormalities. To our knowledge, there is a paucity of published literature regarding this route of administration. Conclusion: Intramuscular olanzapine used IV may be a safe and effective option for the treatment of acutely agitated, delirious, critically ill patient.
