37478275|a|Insomnia is the most common sleep disorder, with persistent insomnia being associated with greater risk and leading to a range of functional consequences that place a heavy burden on patients and healthcare systems. A weight of evidence has shown that complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) seems to have a positive effect on improving sleep. However, the research trends of CAM intervention for insomnia have not been studied systematically through bibliometrics. We searched the relevant literature over the past decade in the Web of Science Core Collection database on September 20, 2022 and used CiteSpace and gCLUTO to visually analyze and cluster countries, institutions, authors, journals and keywords. Through screening, 1655 papers were included. In the past decade, the number of articles published in this field shown an annual trend of growth, with explosive growth in 2020. The USA has the largest number of publications, the University of Hong Kong is the leading institution in this field, and the most cited journal is Sleep. Mental condition and quality of life in patients with insomnia, insomnia related to cancer, effect of mindfulness meditation, yoga and aromatherapy on insomnia and the psychiatric symptoms resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic are at the forefront of this field. In this study, bibliometrics and visualization analysis were performed on related studies on CAM intervention for insomnia. This will be the focus and development direction of insomnia treatment in the future to formulate structured treatment plans for traditional Chinese medicine-related CAM, validate large-scale clinical trials, solve cancer comorbidity insomnia and related psychiatric symptoms and deal with mental health-related insomnia after public health outbreaks.
