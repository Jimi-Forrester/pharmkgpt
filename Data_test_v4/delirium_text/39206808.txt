39206808|t|Loss of Smek1 Induces Tauopathy and Triggers Neurodegeneration by Regulating Microtubule Stability.
39206808|a|Suppressor of Mek1 (Smek1) is a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 4. Genome-wide association studies have shown the protective effect of SMEK1 in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the physiological and pathological roles of Smek1 in AD and other tauopathies are largely unclear. Here, the role of Smek1 in preventing neurodegeneration is investigated in tauopathy. Smek1 is downregulated in the aged human brain. Through single-cell sequencing, a novel neuronal cluster is identified that possesses neurodegenerative characteristics in Smek1-/- mice. Smek1 deficiency caused markedly more severe motor and cognitive impairments in mice, as well as neuronal loss, gliosis, and tau hyperphosphorylation at major glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (Gsk3beta) sites. Protein-protein interaction analysis revealed that the Ran-binding domain (RanBD) in the N-terminus of Smek1 facilitated binding with kinesin family member 2A (Kif2a). Depletion of Smek1 resulted in cytoplasmic aggregation of Kif2a, axon outgrowth defects, and impaired mitochondrial axonal trafficking. Downregulation of Kif2a markedly attenuated tau hyperphosphorylation and axon outgrowth defects in shSmek1 cells. For the first time, this study demonstrates that Smek1 deficiency progressively induces neurodegeneration by exacerbating tau pathology and mitochondrial dysfunction in an age-dependent manner.
