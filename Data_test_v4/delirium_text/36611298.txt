36611298|t|Differences in Striatal Metabolism in [18F]FDG PET in Parkinson's Disease and Atypical Parkinsonism.
36611298|a|Neurodegenerative parkinsonisms affect mainly cognitive and motor functions and are syndromes of overlapping symptoms and clinical manifestations such as tremor, rigidness, and bradykinesia. These include idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) and the atypical parkinsonisms, namely progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), corticobasal degeneration (CBD), multiple system atrophy (MSA) and dementia with Lewy body (DLB). Differences in the striatal metabolism among these syndromes are evaluated using [18F]FDG PET, caused by alterations to the dopaminergic activity and neuronal loss. A study cohort of three patients with PD, 29 with atypical parkinsonism (10 PSP, 6 CBD, 2 MSA, 7 DLB, and 4 non-classifiable), and a control group of 25 patients with normal striatal metabolism is available. Standardized uptake value ratios (SUVR) are extracted from the striatum, and the caudate and the putamen separately. SUVRs are compared among the study groups. In addition, hemispherical and caudate-putamen differences are evaluated in atypical parkinsonisms. Striatal hypermetabolism is detected in patients with PD, while atypical parkinsonisms show hypometabolism, compared to the control group. Hemispherical differences are observed in CBD, MSA and DLB, with the latter also showing statistically significant caudate-putamen asymmetry (p = 0.018). These results indicate disease-specific metabolic uptake patterns in the striatum that can support the differential diagnosis.
