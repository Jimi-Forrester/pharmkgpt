36159401|a|BACKGROUND: Chimeric antigen receptor T-Cell (CAR-T) therapy is an effective new treatment for hematologic malignancies. Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurologic toxicity are main toxicities. CRS-induced rhabdomyolysis (RM) followed by CAR-T therapy treatment has not been previously reported. CASE SUMMARY: We report a case of a 22-year-old woman with relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia obtained sequential cluster of differentiation (CD) 19 and CD22 CAR-T infusion. This patient experienced grade 3 CRS with RM, mild hypotension requiring intravenous fluids, and mild hypoxia and was managed effectively with the IL-6 receptor antagonist tocilizumab. This patient had no signs of immune effector cell-associated neurologic syndrome. Restaging scans 30 d postCAR-T therapy demonstrated a complete remission, and the symptoms of muscle weakness improved through rehabilitation. CONCLUSION: Myalgia is an easily overlooked symptom of severe CRS after CAR-T therapy. It is necessary to monitor myoglobin levels when a patient presents with symptoms of myalgia or acute renal insufficiency.
