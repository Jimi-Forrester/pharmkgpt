27334940|a|In the last decade, several radiolabeled compounds have been developed for the imaging in vivo of amyloid pathology by means of Positron Emission Tomography (PET). Among these, 18F Florbetaben appear to be one of the most reliable for its high affinity for amyloid plaques in brain and its radio-chemical properties that make it usable in common clinical routine. The aim of this review is to provide a general overview of the application in vivo of 18F Florbetaben, describing for first the physiopathological basis of amyloid pathology. Afterwards, the chemical characteristics of this radiolabeled compound will be described, with a particular attention to the synthesis process and the kinetic in vivo. An overview on the imaging protocols and image interpretation will be provided as well and, as a last aspect, the results of the main studies performed in subjects with advanced and early AD will be summarized.
