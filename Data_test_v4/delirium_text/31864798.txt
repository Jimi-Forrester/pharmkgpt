31864798|a|Current options for the treatment of Alzheimers disease have been restricted to prescription of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors or N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist, memantine. Propargylamine-derived multi-target directed ligands, such as ladostigil, M30, ASS234 and contilisant, involve different pathways. Apart from acting as inhibitors of both cholinesterases and monoamine oxidases, they show improvement of cognitive impairment, antioxidant activities, enhancement of iron-chelating activities, protect against tau hyperphosphorylation, block metal-associated oxidative stress, regulate APP and Abeta expression processing by the non-amyloidogenic alpha-secretase pathway, suppress mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening, and coordinate protein kinase C signaling and Bcl-2 family proteins. Other hybrid propargylamine derivatives are also reported.
