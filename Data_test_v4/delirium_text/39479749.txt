39479749|a|BACKGROUND: Delirium is a severe neuropsychiatric syndrome caused by physical illness, associated with high mortality. Understanding risk factors for delirium is key to targeting prevention and screening. Whether severe mental illness (SMI) predisposes people to delirium is not known. We aimed to establish whether pre-existing SMI diagnosis is associated with higher risk of delirium diagnosis and mortality following delirium diagnosis. METHODS: A retrospective cohort and nested case-control study using linked primary and secondary healthcare databases from 2000-2017. We identified people diagnosed with SMI, matched to non-SMI comparators. We compared incidence of delirium diagnoses between people with SMI diagnoses and comparators, and between SMI subtypes; schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and 'other psychosis'. We compared 30-day mortality following a hospitalisation involving delirium between people with SMI diagnoses and comparators, and between SMI subtypes. RESULTS: We identified 20 566 people with SMI diagnoses, matched to 71 374 comparators. Risk of delirium diagnosis was higher for all SMI subtypes, with a higher risk conferred by SMI in the under 65-year group, (aHR:7.65, 95% CI 5.45-10.7, >=65-year group: aHR:3.35, 95% CI 2.77-4.05). Compared to people without SMI, people with an SMI diagnosis overall had no difference in 30-day mortality following a hospitalisation involving delirium (OR:0.66, 95% CI 0.38-1.14). CONCLUSIONS: We found an association between SMI and delirium diagnoses. People with SMI may be more vulnerable to delirium when in hospital than people without SMI. There are limitations to using electronic healthcare records and further prospective study is needed to confirm these findings.
