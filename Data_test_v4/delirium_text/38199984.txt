Recently, extracellular amyloid fibrils have emerged as novel components of the tumor microenvironment; however, their function remains elusive. In this study, we establish a direct connection between the presence of amyloid fibrils in the secretome and the activation of YAP, a transcriptional co-activator involved in cancer proliferation and drug resistance. Furthermore, we uncover a shared mechano-signaling mechanism triggered by amyloid fibrils in both melanoma and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells. Our findings highlight the crucial role of the glycocalyx protein Agrin which binds to extracellular amyloid fibrils and acts as a necessary factor in driving amyloid-dependent YAP activation. Additionally, we reveal the involvement of the HIPPO pathway core kinase LATS1 in this signaling cascade. Finally, we demonstrate that extracellular amyloid fibrils enhance cancer cell migration and invasion. In conclusion, our research expands our knowledge of the tumor microenvironment by uncovering the role of extracellular amyloid fibrils in driving mechano-signaling and YAP activation. This knowledge opens up new avenues for developing innovative strategies to modulate YAP activation and mitigate its detrimental effects during cancer progression.
