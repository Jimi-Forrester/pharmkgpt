30533388|t|Efficacy of Preoperative Administration of Acetaminophen and Melatonin on Retrobulbar Block Associated Pain in Cataract Surgery.
30533388|a|BACKGROUND: Retrobulbar block is one of the chosen methods for local anesthesia in cataract surgery. Since it is a painful procedure, using analgesic and sedative drugs is recommended. Current medications have side effects and evaluating of new drugs or new uses of existing safer drugs is necessary. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to compare the administration of melatonin and acetaminophen on pain and hemodynamic changes during retrobulbar block. METHODS: In a double-blinded randomized trial, 180 patients undergoing cataract surgery were randomly divided into three groups: Melatonin group (received melatonin 6 mg), acetaminophen group (received acetaminophen 500 mg), and control group (received placebo). All drugs were administered orally 60 min before arrival to the operating room by nurses blinded to the drugs administered. All patients received fentanyl 0.5 mug/kg before retrobulbar block intravenously. Hemodynamic variables and pain score in each patient were evaluated on arrival in the operating room, during retrobulbar block, during surgery, 20 min after operation, at the end of surgery, and in the recovery room. In case of pain score more than three, additional fentanyl was administered. All data were recorded in structured data sheets. RESULTS: Data analysis indicated no significant differences among the groups at baseline on any of the demographic variables. Both acetaminophen and melatonin reduced the pain score significantly compared with control during retrobulbar block (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively). Administration of additional fentanyl was significantly lower in the melatonin group than the control group (P < 0.05). Hemodynamic changes were not significantly different among all groups. CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, as far as we have studied, the analgesic effect of acetaminophen on the retrobulbar block was indicated. We also showed that melatonin can reduce pain during retrobulbar block leading to reduction of additional fentanyl during operation. It seems that both melatonin and acetaminophen may have a beneficial effect on pain control in the retrobulbar block.
