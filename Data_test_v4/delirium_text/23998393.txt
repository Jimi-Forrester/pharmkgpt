23998393|t|Apolipoprotein E as a beta-amyloid-independent factor in Alzheimer's disease.
23998393|a|APOE, which encodes apolipoprotein E, is the most prevalent and best established genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease. Current understanding of Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology posits an important role for apolipoprotein E in the disease cascade via its interplay with beta-amyloid. However, evidence is also emerging for roles of apolipoprotein E in the disease process that are independent of beta-amyloid. Particular areas of interest are lipid metabolism, tau pathology, neuroenergetics, neurodevelopment, synaptic plasticity, the neurovasculature, and neuroinflammation. The intent of this article is to review the literature in each of these areas.
