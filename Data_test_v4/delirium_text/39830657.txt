39830657|a|Background: Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are complex compounds that play a critical role in neurological disorders, including the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Methylglyoxal (MG) is recognized as the primary precursor of AGEs. Methylglyoxal is produced endogenously and also introduced through dietary exposures. Objectives: This study aimed to investigate and compare the effects of aminoguanidine (AG), semicarbazide (SC), and thiosemicarbazide (TSC) on MG-induced neurological toxicity in rats. Methods: Male Wistar rats were exposed orally to MG, MG + AG, MG + SC, and MG + TSC for 70 days. Neurobehavioral, biochemical, and histopathological changes were evaluated. Results: The findings indicated that oral administration of MG for 70 days resulted in memory impairment and increased anxiety in neurobehavioral tests. Additionally, MG elevated protein carbonylation in brain tissues. Semicarbazide was found to prevent MG-induced memory problems, while both SC and AG reduced carbonyl content in brain tissues. Aminoguanidine and TSC were effective in alleviating anxiety induced by MG exposure. Histopathological analysis revealed that MG caused cell damage and neuronal necrosis in the hippocampus, particularly in the cornu ammonis 1 and 3 (CA1 and CA3) and AG, SC, and TSC improved neuronal survival specifically in the CA1 and DG areas. Conclusions: The data suggest that SC, AG, and TSC may offer neuroprotective effects against MG-induced neurobehavioral toxicity. Further studies are required to explore the mechanisms of action of these compounds.
