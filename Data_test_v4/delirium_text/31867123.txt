31867123|a|BACKGROUND: Hypertension is one of the most relevant risk factors in vascular aging, stroke and vascular dementia (VD). In the elderly, the prevalence of mixed dementia, which consists of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and VD, is increased. Moreover, disorders of blood vessels are reported to be involved in the onset and progression of AD. Thus, hypertension generally plays an important role in dementia overall. MAIN TEXT: Mid-life hypertension is reported to be related to the incidence of dementia, but it is reported that antihypertensive treatment in aged people cannot prevent the onset and progression of dementia. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is deeply involved in not only hypertension but also lifestyle-related diseases, and may contribute to the pathological mechanism in dementia; thus, RAS regulation is expected to prevent dementia. Small vessel structural changes in lifestyle-related diseases may play a role in dementia in the elderly. CONCLUSION: Here, we discuss the role of blood pressure elevation in dementia and the therapeutic possibility of antihypertensive treatment against dementia.
