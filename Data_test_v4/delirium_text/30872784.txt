Autoantibodies formed during neuronal inflammation show excellent stability in blood; therefore, they may be convenient blood-based diagnostic markers of AD. Here, we performed microarray analysis of 29,240 unbiased random peptides to be used for comprehensive screening of AD-specific IgG and IgM antibodies in the blood. The results showed that (1) sequence-specific and isotype-specific antibodies are regulated differentially in AD, and combinations of these antibodies showing high area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values (0.862-0.961) can be used to classify AD, (2) AD-specific IgG antibodies arise from IgM antibody-secreting cells that existed before disease onset and (3) target protein profiling of the antibodies identified some AD-related proteins, some of which are involved in AD-related signalling pathways. Therefore, we propose that these epitopes may facilitate the development of biomarkers for AD diagnosis and form the basis for a mechanistic study related to AD progression.
