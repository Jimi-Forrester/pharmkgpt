38061270|t|Unraveling the role of miRNAs in the diagnosis, progression, and therapeutic intervention of Alzheimer's disease.
38061270|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifaceted, advancing neurodegenerative illness that is responsible for most cases of neurological impairment and dementia in the aged population. As the disease progresses, affected individuals may experience cognitive decline, linguistic problems, affective instability, and behavioral changes. The intricate nature of AD reflects the altered molecular mechanisms participating in the affected human brain. MicroRNAs (miRNAs, miR) are essential for the intricate control of gene expression in neurobiology. miRNAs exert their influence by modulating the transcriptome of brain cells, which typically exhibit substantial genetic activity, encompassing gene transcription and mRNA production. Presently, comprehensive studies are being conducted on AD to identify miRNA-based signatures that are indicative of the disease pathophysiology. These findings can contribute to the advancement of our understanding of the mechanisms underlying this disorder and can inform the development of therapeutic interventions based on miRNA and related RNA molecules. Therefore, this comprehensive review provides a detailed holistic analysis of the latest advances discussing the emerging role of miRNAs in the progression of AD and their possible application as potential biomarkers and targets for therapeutic interventions in future studies.
