38419091|a|BACKGROUND: The development of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) technology has enabled human cellular disease modeling for inaccessible cell types, such as neural cells in the brain. However, many of the iPSC-derived disease models established to date typically involve only a single cell type. These monoculture models are inadequate for accurately simulating the brain environment, where multiple cell types interact. The limited cell type diversity in monoculture models hinders the accurate recapitulation of disease phenotypes resulting from interactions between different cell types. Therefore, our goal was to create cell models that include multiple interacting cell types to better recapitulate disease phenotypes. METHODS: To establish a co-culture model of neurons and astrocytes, we individually induced neurons and astrocytes from the same iPSCs using our novel differentiation methods, and then co-cultured them. We evaluated the effects of co-culture on neurons and astrocytes using immunocytochemistry, immuno-electron microscopy, and Ca2+ imaging. We also developed a co-culture model using iPSCs from a patient with familial Alzheimer's disease (AD) patient (APP V717L mutation) to investigate whether this model would manifest disease phenotypes not seen in the monoculture models. RESULTS: The co-culture of the neurons and astrocytes increased the branching of astrocyte processes, the number of GFAP-positive cells, neuronal activities, the number of synapses, and the density of presynaptic vesicles. In addition, immuno-electron microscopy confirmed the formation of a tripartite synaptic structure in the co-culture model, and inhibition of glutamate transporters increased neuronal activity. Compared to the co-culture model of the control iPSCs, the co-culture model of familial AD developed astrogliosis-like phenotype, which was not observed in the monoculture model of astrocytes. CONCLUSIONS: Co-culture of iPSC-derived neurons and astrocytes enhanced the morphological changes mimicking the in vivo condition of both cell types. The formation of the functional tripartite synaptic structures in the co-culture model suggested the mutual interaction between the cells. Furthermore, the co-culture model with the APP V717L mutation expressed in neurons exhibited an astrocytic phenotype reminiscent of AD brain pathology. These results suggest that our co-culture model is a valuable tool for disease modeling of neurodegenerative diseases.
