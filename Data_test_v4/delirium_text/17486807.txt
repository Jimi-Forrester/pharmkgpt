17486807|t|Delirium part two: nursing management.
17486807|a|Delirium is a common and under-reported problem in older adults. It can have a negative effect on patient outcomes and nurses often fail to identify it. This is the second part of an article that outlines nursing interventions based on the Roper, Logan and Tierney model of the activities of living. The first part of this article, which examined the clinical features, risk factors and assessment of delirium, was published in last week's Nursing Standard.
