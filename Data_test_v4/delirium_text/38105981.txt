38105981|a|The human brain expresses thousands of different long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), and aberrant expression of specific lncRNAs has been associated with cognitive and psychiatric disorders. While a growing number of lncRNAs are now known to regulate neural cell development and function, relatively few have been shown to underlie animal behavior, particularly with genetic strategies that establish lncRNA function in trans. Pnky is an evolutionarily conserved, neural lncRNA that regulates brain development. Using mouse genetic strategies, we show that Pnky has sex-specific roles in mouse behavior and that this lncRNA underlies specific behavior by functioning in trans. Male Pnky-knockout (KO) mice have deficits in cued fear recall, a type of Pavlovian associative memory. In female Pnky-KO mice, the acoustic startle response (ASR) is increased and accompanied by a decrease in prepulse inhibition (PPI), both of which are behaviors altered in affective disorders. Remarkably, expression of Pnky from a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgene reverses the ASR phenotype of female Pnky-KO mice, demonstrating that Pnky underlies specific animal behavior by functioning in trans. More broadly, these data provide genetic evidence that a lncRNA gene and its function in trans can play a key role in the behavior of adult mammals, contributing fundamental knowledge to our growing understanding of the association between specific lncRNAs and disorders of cognition and mood.
