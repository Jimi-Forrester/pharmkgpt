37509690|t|Clinical Variables Related to Functional Capacity and Exertional Desaturation in Patients with COVID-19.
37509690|a|Impaired functional capacity is one of the most commonly reported consequences among post-COVID-19 patients. This study aimed to analyse the clinical variables related to functional capacity and exertional desaturation in post-COVID-19 patients at the time of hospital discharge. A cross-sectional study was conducted on patients recovering from COVID-19 pneumonia. The main outcomes measures were functional capacity, assessed using the 1 min sit-to-stand test (1 min STST), and exertional desaturation, defined as a drop of >=4% in the arterial oxygen saturation. Factors used to characterise the participant outcomes included the use of a high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC), prolonged hospitalisation, occurrence of pulmonary embolism during hospitalisation, and underlying comorbidities. A total of 381 participants (mean age = 53.7 +- 13.2 years, 65.6% men) were included. Participants completed a mean of 16.9 +- 6.2 repetitions in the 1 min STST. Exertional desaturation was observed in 51% of the patients. Higher odds of exertional desaturation were found in the participants who used a HFNC (OR = 3.6; 95%CI: 1.6 to 7.8), were admitted in the hospital >10 days (OR = 4.2; 95%CI: 2.6 to 6.8), and had a pulmonary embolism (OR = 3.5; 95%CI: 2.2. to 5.3). Use of a HFNC (beta = -3.4; 95%CI: -5.3 to -1.44), a hospital stay >10 days (beta = -2.2; 95%CI: -3.4 to -0.9), and a history of pulmonary embolism (beta = -1.4; 95%CI: -2.6 to -0.2) were also negatively associated with the 1 min STST. Most post-COVID-19 patients exhibited reduced functional capacity at the time of hospital discharge, and approximately half had exertional desaturation after the 1 min STST. The use of a HFNC, prolonged hospitalisation and pulmonary embolism were the main clinical variables associated with worse a 1 min STST performance and a higher likelihood of exertional desaturation.
