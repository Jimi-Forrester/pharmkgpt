38847667|a|This study aimed to investigate the different impacts of sensorial and mobility frailty on overall and domain-specific cognitive function. Further, the independent associations between other intricate capacity (IC) dimensions, including vitality and psychological dimensions, and overall and domain-specific cognitive function were investigated. A total of 429 participants (mean age, 72.91 +- 7.014 years; 57.30% female) underwent IC capacity assessment. Other covariates, such as demographics, health-related variables were also assessed. Overall or domain-specific cognitive impairment was used as a dependent variable in logistic regression analyses adjusted for demographic, health-related, and psychosocial confounders. After adjustment for demographic, health-related, and psychosocial confounders, individuals with sensorial frailty (odds ratio [OR] = 0.435; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.236-0.801; P = .008) had a significantly lower risk of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), marginally low delayed memory impairment (OR = 0.601, 95% CI = 0.347-1.040; P = .069), and language impairment (OR = 0.534, 95% CI = 0.305-0.936; OR = 0.318, P = .029; OR = 0.318,95% CI = 0.173-0.586; P < .001) by Boston naming and animal fluency tests than did those with both sensorial and mobility frailty or mobility frailty only. Depressive symptoms had a significant negative influence on executive function. Cardiovascular disease and non-skin malignancy were independent determinants of MCI, and diabetes mellitus was independently associated with processing speed, attention, and executive function. Sensorial and mobility frailty were independent risk factors for cognitive impairment. Mobility frailty had a greater negative influence on the overall cognitive function and memory and language function than did sensorial frailty. The reserve decline in the psychological dimension of IC and chronic diseases also had a significant adverse influence on overall and domain-specific cognition function.
