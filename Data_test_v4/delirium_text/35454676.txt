35454676|a|Chlorpyrifos (CPF) and 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) are insecticides and herbicides which has been widely used on farms. However, CPF and 2,4-D residues on corps can bring high risks to human health. Accurate detection of pesticide residues is important for controlling health risks caused by CPF and 2,4-D. Therefore, we developed a fast, sensitive, economical, and lossless surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS)-based method for pesticide detection. It can rapidly and simultaneously determine the CPF and 2,4-D mixed pesticide residues on an apple surface at a minimum of 0.001 mg L-1 concentration, which is far below the pesticide residue standard in China and the EU. The limits of detection reach down to 1.28 x 10-9 mol L-1 for CPF and 2.47 x 10-10 mol L-1 for 2,4-D. The limits of quantification are 4.27 x 10-9 mol L-1 and 8.23 x 10-10 mol L-1 for CPF and 2,4-D. This method has a great potential for the accurate detection of pesticide residues, and may be applied to other fields of agricultural products and food industry.
