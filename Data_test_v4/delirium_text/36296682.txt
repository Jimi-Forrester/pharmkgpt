36296682|t|Mechanism and Regulation of Microglia Polarization in Intracerebral Hemorrhage.
36296682|a|Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is the most lethal subtype of stroke, but effective treatments are lacking, and neuroinflammation plays a key role in the pathogenesis. In the innate immune response to cerebral hemorrhage, microglia first appear around the injured tissue and are involved in the inflammatory cascade response. Microglia respond to acute brain injury by being activated and polarized to either a typical M1-like (pro-inflammatory) or an alternative M2-like (anti-inflammatory) phenotype. These two polarization states produce pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory. With the discovery of the molecular mechanisms and key signaling molecules related to the polarization of microglia in the brain, some targets that regulate the polarization of microglia to reduce the inflammatory response are considered a treatment for secondary brain tissue after ICH damage effective strategies. Therefore, how to promote the polarization of microglia to the M2 phenotype after ICH has become the focus of attention in recent years. This article reviews the mechanism of action of microglia's M1 and M2 phenotypes in secondary brain injury after ICH. Moreover, it discusses compounds and natural pharmaceutical ingredients that can polarize the M1 to the M2 phenotype.
