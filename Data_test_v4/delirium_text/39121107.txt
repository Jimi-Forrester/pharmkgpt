39121107|a|Recently the 1/f signal of human electroencephalography has attracted attention, as it could potentially reveal a quantitative measure of neural excitation and inhibition in the brain, that may be relevant in a clinical setting. The purpose of this short article is to show that the 1/f signal depends on the vigilance state of the brain in both humans and mice. Therefore, proper labelling of the EEG signal is important as improper labelling may obscure disease-related changes in the 1/f signal. We demonstrate this by comparing EEG results from a longitudinal study in a genetic mouse model for synaptic dysfunction in schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders to results from a large European cohort study with schizophrenia and mild Alzheimer's disease patients. The comparison shows when the 1/f is corrected for vigilance state there is a difference between groups, and this effect disappears when vigilance state is not corrected for. In conclusion, more attention should be paid to the vigilance state during analysis of EEG signals regardless of the species.
