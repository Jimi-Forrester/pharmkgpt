8091343|t|[Role of cytokines in the central nervous system].
8091343|a|Cytokines were first characterized as high-molecular weight modulators of the immune response. However they also play an important role in the CNS. Thus, some cytokines could influence the synaptic transmission or modulate the neuronal and glial growth during brain development or after brain injury. Activated glial cells appear to be the major cytokines producing cells. Some of these cytokines are glial cells mitogens, whilst others have a direct neurotrophic activity. These effects seem to be mediated by receptors similar to those of neurotrophic factors. Cytokines might be crucial factors in the evolution of different acute or chronic neuropathological processes such as ischemia, brain trauma, multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease. Control of their effect on brain cells could allow prevention of brain damage observed in such pathologies.
