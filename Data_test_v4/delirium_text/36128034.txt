36128034|a|Purpose: Multidisciplinary care has become a cornerstone of colorectal cancer management. To evaluate the clinical efficacy of a geriatric multidisciplinary oncology clinic (GMOC), we analyzed the surgical treatment decision-making process and outcomes. Methods: This retrospective single-center study reviewed the data of patients aged >=65 years who participated in the GMOC at a tertiary referral hospital between 2015 and 2021. The clinical adherence rate, comprehensive geriatric assessment, and a multidimensional frailty score (MFS) were obtained. The groups that were recommended and not recommended for surgery were compared, analyzing the factors impacting the decision and 1-year survival outcomes. Furthermore, the postoperative complications of patients who underwent surgery were evaluated. Results: A total of 165 patients visited the GMOC, and 74 had colorectal cancer (mean age, 85.5 years [range, 81.2-89.0 years]). Among patients with systemic disease (n = 31), 7 were recommended for surgery, and 5 underwent surgery. Among patients with locoregional disease (n = 43), 18 were recommended for surgery, and 12 underwent surgery. Patients recommended and not recommended for surgery had significantly different activities of daily living (ADL) (P = 0.024), instrumental ADL (P = 0.001), Mini-Mental State Examination (P = 0.014), delirium risk (P = 0.039), and MFS (P = 0.001). There was no difference in the 1-year overall survival between the 2 groups (P = 0.980). Of the 17 patients who underwent surgery, the median (interquartile range) of operation time was 165.0 minutes (120.0-270.0 minutes); hospital stay, 7.0 days (6.0-8.0 days); and 3 patients had wound complications. Conclusion: Proper counseling of patients through the GMOC could lead to appropriate management and favorable outcomes.
