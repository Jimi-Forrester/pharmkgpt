34513413|t|17-Month-Old Girl With Severe, Prolonged Lethargy and Somnolence.
34513413|a|A 17-month-old girl arrived at the pediatric ED with decreased responsiveness. She was lethargic, localizing only to noxious stimuli with vital signs significant for fever of 103.8  F, heart rate of 185 beats/min, respiratory rate of 12 breaths/min, blood pressure of 100/59 mmHg, and oxygen saturation level of 88% on room air. She was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) due to concerns of septic meningitis with altered mental status and respiratory distress, and was treated with antibiotics. A respiratory viral panel (RVP) was positive for adenovirus, resulting in all antibiotics being discontinued. She remained lethargic until day nine of illness, when she had improved almost completely to her baseline. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of her cerebral spinal fluid returned positive for adenovirus serotype A, thus confirming our case of transient adenovirus encephalopathy. This case illustrates the importance of keeping adenovirus in the differential for encephalopathy versus a neurologic abnormality or other malignant or infectious etiology.
