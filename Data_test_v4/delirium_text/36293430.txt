36293430|t|Relationships between Inflammation and Age-Related Neurocognitive Changes.
36293430|a|The relationship between inflammation and age-related neurocognitive changes is significant, which may relate to the age-related immune dysfunctions characterized by the senescence of immune cells and elevated inflammatory markers in the peripheral circulation and the central nervous system. In this review, we discuss the potential mechanisms, including the development of vascular inflammation, neuroinflammation, organelle dysfunctions, abnormal cholesterol metabolism, and glymphatic dysfunctions as well as the role that the key molecules play in the immune-cognition interplay. We propose potential therapeutic pharmacological and behavioral strategies for ameliorating age-related neurocognitive changes associated with inflammation. Further research to decipher the multidimensional roles of chronic inflammation in normal and pathological aging processes will help unfold the pathophysiological mechanisms underpinning neurocognitive disorders. The insight gained will lay the path for developing cost-effective preventative measures and the buffering or delaying of age-related neurocognitive decline.
