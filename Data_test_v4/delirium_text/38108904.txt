38108904|a|BACKGROUND: Although it has been reported that patients with pneumococcal pneumonia may develop meningitis, lumbar puncture is not systematically recommended in these patients, even in patients with associated bacteremia or invasive pneumococcal disease. The aim of this study was to determine the characteristics and outcomes of patients admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) for pneumococcal community-acquired pneumonia who developed meningitis. METHODS: We retrospectively included all consecutive patients admitted to our ICU from January 2006 to December 2020 for severe pneumococcal community-acquired pneumonia according to American Thoracic Society criteria. Meningitis was defined as pleocytosis > 5 cells/mm3 or a positive culture of cerebrospinal fluid for Streptococcus pneumoniae in lumbar puncture. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with meningitis during their ICU stay. RESULTS: Overall, 262 patients [64(52-75) years old] were included: 154(59%) were male, 80(30%) had chronic respiratory disease, 105(39%) were immunocompromised and 6(2%) were vaccinated against S. pneumoniae. A lumbar puncture was performed in 88(34%) patients with a delay from ICU admission to puncture lumbar of 10.5 (2.8-24.1) h and after the initiation of pneumococcal antibiotherapy in 81(92%) patients. Meningitis was diagnosed in 14 patients: 16% of patients with lumbar puncture and 5% of patients in the whole population. Patients with meningitis had more frequently human immunodeficiency virus positive status (29 vs. 5%, p = 0.02), neurological deficits on ICU admission (43 vs. 16%, p = 0.03) and pneumococcal bacteremia (71 vs. 30%, p < 0.01) than those without. The ICU mortality rate (14 vs. 13%, p = 0.73) and the mortality rate at Day-90 (21 vs. 15%, p = 0.83) did not differ between patients with and without meningitis. The proportion of patients with neurological disorders at ICU discharge was higher in patients with meningitis (64 vs. 23%, p < 0.001) than in those without. The other outcomes did not differ at ICU discharge, Day-30 and Day-90 between the two groups of patients. CONCLUSION: Meningitis was diagnosed in 16% of patients with severe pneumococcal community-acquired pneumonia in whom a lumbar puncture was performed, was more frequent in patients with pneumococcal bacteremia and was associated with more frequent neurological disorders at ICU discharge. Further studies are needed to confirm these results.
