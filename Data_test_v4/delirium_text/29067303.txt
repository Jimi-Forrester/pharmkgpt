29067303|a|INTRODUCTION: Impairment of cerebrovascular function becomes evident after menopause. No study has yet explored relationships between deficits in cerebrovascular function, cognitive performance, and mood in postmenopausal women. METHOD: Cerebrovascular function was assessed in 80 healthy postmenopausal women by monitoring blood flow velocity (BFV) in the middle and posterior cerebral arteries using transcranial Doppler ultrasound at rest, following a hypercapnic challenge, and during performance of a cognitive test battery; the latter assessed domains of memory and executive functions. Various measures of mood (i.e., Profile of Mood States and Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale) were also assessed. RESULTS: Cerebral artery elasticity and BFV responsiveness to cognitive tests (neurovascular coupling) correlated with cognitive performance but not with depressive symptoms or mood states. Mood deficits were related to poor cognitive performance. CONCLUSION: These results highlight the importance of adequate cerebral perfusion for optimized cognitive function in healthy postmenopausal women. Preventative strategies to attenuate accelerated cognitive decline should also consider restoring cerebrovascular function.
