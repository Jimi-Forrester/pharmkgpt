36306110|t|SIRT1 activation and its circadian clock control: a promising approach against (frailty in) neurodegenerative disorders.
36306110|a|With the increase in life expectancy, the incidence of neurodegenerative disorders and their impact worldwide has been increasing in recent years. Neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease, have complex and varied mechanisms of pathogenesis. Importantly, they share the common feature of disrupted circadian rhythms. This hallmark is believed to underlie the symptoms of such diseases and even potentially contribute to their onset. In addition, the association of physical frailty with dementia and neurodegenerative disorders has been demonstrated. In fact, frail persons are 8 times more likely to have some form of dementia and population studies report a significant prevalence for frailty in older patients with AD and PD. SIRT1 regulates the acetylation status of clock components and controls circadian amplitude of clock genes. However, the mechanisms responsible for this circadian clock control have been the subject of contradictory findings. Importantly, the activation of SIRT1 has been shown to have very relevant therapeutic potential against neurodegeneration. Nevertheless, few studies have attempted to connect the therapeutic reestablishing of SIRT1 as an approach against circadian disruption in neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we address: circadian rhythms as an important early biomarker of neurodegenerative disorders; mechanisms for SIRT1 activation and the novel sirtuin-activating compounds (STACs); SIRT1 circadian paradox and subsequent studies in an unprecedented way in the literature; the beneficial role of SIRT1 activation in neurodegeneration; innovative proposals of how circadian-based interventions (e.g., SIRT1 activators) may become an important therapeutic approach against neurodegenerative disorders and how non-pharmacologic interventions (e.g., Mediterranean-style diet) might help in the prevention and/or treatment of these high-burden disorders, while tackling frailty and enhancing robustness.
