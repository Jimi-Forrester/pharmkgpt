Natural products offer many options to reduce the progress and symptoms of many kinds of diseases, including AD. Meanwhile, natural compound structures, including lignans, flavonoids, tannins, polyphenols, triterpenes, sterols, and alkaloids, have anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-amyloidogenic, and anticholinesterase activities. In this review, we summarize the pathogenesis and targets for treatment of AD. We also present several medicinal plants and isolated compounds that are used for preventing and reducing symptoms of AD.
