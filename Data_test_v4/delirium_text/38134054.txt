38134054|a|With the progress and rapid societal development, women are confronted with multifaceted pressures in their lives, encompassing familial and other domains. Furthermore, during the perimenopausal phase, endocrine equilibrium is disrupted, leading to the emergence of psychological and physiological health challenges. Insomnia is a prevalent symptom among perimenopausal individuals. The brain-gut-bacteria axis assumes a pivotal role in the prevention, diagnosis, and management of perimenopausal insomnia. Chaihu Jia Longgu Muli decoction is a commonly prescribed remedy for addressing perimenopopausal insomnia. Consequently, this paper aims to investigate the interplay between the brain-gut-bacteria axis, intestinal microbiota, and the pathogenesis of perimenopausal insomnia. The study focuses on examining the regulatory effects of Chaihu Jia Longgu Muli decoction on the nervous system, intestinal microbiota, and the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis. Additionally, it explores the mechanisms underlying Hujia Longgu Muli decoction in mitigating perimenopausal insomnia.
