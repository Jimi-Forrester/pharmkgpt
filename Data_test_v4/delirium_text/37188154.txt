37188154|t|Low Skeletal Muscle Mass and the Incidence of Delirium in Hospitalized Older Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies.
37188154|a|Background: Both low skeletal muscle mass and delirium are prevalent in older hospitalized patients, while their associations are unclear. This systematic review and meta-analysis aim to investigate the associations between low skeletal muscle mass and the incidence of delirium in hospitalized patients. Methods: The PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase were searched for relevant studies published before May 2022, and we conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis according to the PRISMA and MOOSE guidelines. The summary odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated, and subgroup analyses were also conducted according to the age and major surgeries. Results: Finally, nine studies with 3 828 patients were included. The pooled result showed no significant association between low skeletal muscle mass and the incidence of delirium (OR 1.69, 95% CI 0.85 to 2.52). However, sensitivity analysis suggested that one study caused a significant alteration of the summary result, and the meta-analysis of the remaining 8 studies showed that low skeletal muscle mass was significantly associated with an 88% increased incidence of delirium (OR 1.88, 95% CI 1.43 to 2.33). Furthermore, subgroup analyses indicated that low skeletal muscle mass was associated with a higher incidence of delirium in patients >=75 years old or undergoing major surgeries instead of those <75 years old or without surgeries, respectively. Conclusions: Hospitalized patients with low skeletal muscle mass might have higher incidence of delirium, particularly in those of older age and undergoing major surgeries. Therefore, great attention should be paid to these patients.
