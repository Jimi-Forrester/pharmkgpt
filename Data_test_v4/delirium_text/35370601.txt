35370601|t|Computed Tomography Density and beta-Amyloid Deposition of Intraorbital Optic Nerve May Assist in Diagnosing Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer's Disease: A 18F-Flutemetamol Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography Study.
35370601|a|Objective: The aim was to study whether the computed tomography (CT) density and beta-amyloid (Abeta) level of intraorbital optic nerve could assist in diagnosing mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Methods: A total of sixty subjects were recruited in our study, including nine normal control (NC) subjects (i.e., 4 men and 5 women), twenty four MCI subjects (i.e., 11 men and 13 women), and twenty seven AD subjects (i.e., 14 men and 13 women). All subjects conducted 18F-flutemetamol amyloid positron emission tomography (PET)/CT imaging. Blinded to the clinical information of the subjects, two physicians independently measured and calculated the standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) of the bilateral occipital cortex, SUVR of the bilateral intraorbital optic nerve, and CT density of the bilateral intraorbital optic nerve by using GE AW 4.5 Workstation. Results: Between AD and NC groups, the differences of the bilateral intraorbital optic nerve SUVR were statistically significant; between AD and MCI groups, the differences of the left intraorbital optic nerve SUVR were statistically significant. Between any two of the three groups, the differences in the bilateral intraorbital optic nerve density were statistically significant. The bilateral occipital SUVR was positively correlated with the bilateral intraorbital optic nerve SUVR and negatively correlated with the bilateral intraorbital optic nerve density. Bilateral intraorbital optic nerve SUVR was negatively correlated with the bilateral intraorbital optic nerve density. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of multiple logistic regression was 0.9167 (for MCI vs. NC) and 0.8951 (for AD vs. MCI). The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores were positively associated with the intraorbital optic nerve density and were negatively associated with the intraorbital optic nerve SUVR. The regression equation of MoCA was y = 16.37-0.9734 x x 1 + 0.5642 x x 2-3.127 x x 3 + 0.0275 x x 4; the R 2 was 0.848. The regression equation of MMSE was y = 19.57-1.633 x x 1 + 0.4397 x x 2-1.713 x x 3 + 0.0424 x x 4; the R 2 was 0.827. Conclusion: The CT density and Abeta deposition of the intraorbital optic nerve were associated with Abeta deposition of the occipital cortex and the severity of cognitive impairment. The intraorbital optic nerve CT density and intraorbital optic nerve Abeta deposition could assist in diagnosing MCI and AD.
