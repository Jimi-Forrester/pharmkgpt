38586868|t|Regenerative treatment of ophthalmic diseases with stem cells: Principles, progress, and challenges.
38586868|a|Background: Degenerate eye disorders, such as glaucoma, cataracts and age-related macular degeneration (AMD), are prevalent causes of blindness and visual impairment worldwide. Other eye disorders, including limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD), dry eye diseases (DED), and retinitis pigmentosa (RP), result in symptoms such as ocular discomfort and impaired visual function, significantly impacting quality of life. Traditional therapies are limited, primarily focus on delaying disease progression, while emerging stem cell therapy directly targets ocular tissues, aiming to restore ocular function by reconstructing ocular tissue. Main text: The utilization of stem cells for the treatment of diverse degenerative ocular diseases is becoming increasingly significant, owing to the regenerative and malleable properties of stem cells and their functional cells. Currently, stem cell therapy for ophthalmopathy involves various cell types, such as embryonic stem cells (ESCs), induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), and retinal progenitor cells (RPCs). In the current article, we will review the current progress regarding the utilization of stem cells for the regeneration of ocular tissue covering key eye tissues from the cornea to the retina. These therapies aim to address the loss of functional cells, restore damaged ocular tissue and or in a paracrine-mediated manner. We also provide an overview of the ocular disorders that stem cell therapy is targeting, as well as the difficulties and opportunities in this field. Conclusions: Stem cells can not only promote tissue regeneration but also release exosomes to mitigate inflammation and provide neuroprotection, making stem cell therapy emerge as a promising approach for treating a wide range of eye disorders through multiple mechanisms.
