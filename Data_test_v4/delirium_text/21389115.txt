21389115|a|Nuclear fragmentation is a common feature in many neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, we show that nuclear lamina dispersion is an early and irreversible trigger for cell death initiated by deregulated Cdk5, rather than a consequence of apoptosis. Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) activity is significantly increased in AD and contributes to all three hallmarks: neurotoxic amyloid-beta (Abeta), neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), and extensive cell death. Using Abeta and glutamate as the neurotoxic stimuli, we show that deregulated Cdk5 induces nuclear lamina dispersion by direct phosphorylation of lamin A and lamin B1 in neuronal cells and primary cortical neurons. Phosphorylation-resistant mutants of lamins confer resistance to nuclear dispersion and cell death on neurotoxic stimulation, highlighting this as a major mechanism for neuronal death. Rapid alteration of lamin localization pattern and nuclear membrane change are further supported by in vivo data using an AD mouse model. After p25 induction, the pattern of lamin localization was significantly altered, preceding neuronal death, suggesting that it is an early pathological event in p25-inducible transgenic mice. Importantly, lamin dispersion is coupled with Cdk5 nuclear localization, which is highly neurotoxic. Inhibition of nuclear dispersion rescues neuronal cells from cell death, underscoring the significance of this event to Cdk5-mediated neurotoxicity.
