37828583|a|BACKGROUND: Nonadherence to medication is a major issue in patients with chronic disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD). Many interventions for increasing adherence have been tested, and these have shown weak-to-moderate efficiency. Although the best methods to improve adherence remain unclear, it is reasonable to use tailored interventions instead of the "one-size-fits-all" approach. METHODS: A randomized, controlled, triple-blinded trial in elderly patients with PD is conducted to test the efficacy of AdhCare, a tailored intervention to enhance adherence compared with that achieved with routine care (64 participants per arm). Motor function, quality of life, and adherence measures will be assessed at baseline and at 3 and 6 months of follow-up. The type of intervention depends on the main personal reason for nonadherence (e.g., forgetting to take the medication or poor knowledge about the medication). DISCUSSION: The results of this study will provide valuable information for health professionals and policymakers on the effectiveness of tailored interventions in elderly patients with PD.
