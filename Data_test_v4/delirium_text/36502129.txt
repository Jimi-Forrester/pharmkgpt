36502129|t|ANN-Based Discernment of Septic and Inflammatory Synovial Fluid: A Novel Method Using Viscosity Data from a QCR Sensor.
36502129|a|The synovial fluid (SF) analysis involves a series of chemical and physical studies that allow opportune diagnosing of septic, inflammatory, non-inflammatory, and other pathologies in joints. Among the variety of analyses to be performed on the synovial fluid, the study of viscosity can help distinguish between these conditions, since this property is affected in pathological cases. The problem with viscosity measurement is that it usually requires a large sample volume, or the necessary instrumentation is bulky and expensive. This study compares the viscosity of normal synovial fluid samples with samples with infectious and inflammatory pathologies and classifies them using an ANN (Artificial Neural Network). For this purpose, a low-cost, portable QCR-based sensor (10 MHz) was used to measure the viscous responses of the samples by obtaining three parameters: Deltaf, DeltaGamma (parameters associated with the viscoelastic properties of the fluid), and viscosity calculation. These values were used to train the algorithm. Different versions of the ANN were compared, along with other models, such as SVM and random forest. Thirty-three samples of SF were analyzed. Our study suggests that the viscosity characterized by our sensor can help distinguish infectious synovial fluid, and that implementation of ANN improves the accuracy of synovial fluid classification.
