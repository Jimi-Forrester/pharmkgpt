21046692|t|Cholinesterase inhibitors:  beyond Alzheimer's disease.
21046692|a|Cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) are widely licensed for the symptomatic treatment of Alzheimer's disease, but their use has also been examined in a wide variety of neurological disorders besides Alzheimer's disease, and this article reviews these uses. The evidence currently available suggests that ChEIs may possibly have a role in the treatment of some patients with dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson's disease dementia, but at this point in time there would seem to be only a limited case for recommending ChEIs in mild cognitive impairment, Down syndrome, progressive supranuclear palsy, pure vascular dementia, frontotemporal lobar degeneration, Huntington's disease, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, delirium, traumatic brain injury, sleep-related disorders or certain psychiatric disorders (e.g., schizophrenia and bipolar disorder). Clinical practice with respect to non-Alzheimer's disease indications for ChEIs may vary according to jurisdiction, specifically with regards to whether national guidelines effectively limit off-licence drug use.
