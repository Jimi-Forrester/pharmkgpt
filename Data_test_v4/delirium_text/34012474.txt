34012474|t|Comparison of Effects between Combined Lumbar-Sacral Plexus Block plus General Anesthesia and Unilateral Spinal Anesthesia in Elderly Patients Undergoing Hip Fracture Surgery: A Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial.
34012474|a|PURPOSE: Hip fracture is a common injury in geriatric populations, which is associated with poor quality of life. However, the ideal anesthesia technique for this disease is yet to be identified. This study aimed to compare the combined lumbar-sacral plexus block (CLSB) plus general anesthesia (bispectral index (BIS) 60-80) with the unilateral spinal anesthesia (SA) on activity of daily living in elderly patients undergoing hip fracture surgery. METHODS: A total of 124 elderly patients undergoing hip fracture surgery were randomly assigned to two groups. Patients in the SA group received light-specific gravity spinal anesthesia, and patients in the CLSB group received lumbar and sacral plexus block with general anesthesia (BIS 60-80). The primary outcomes were 30-day activity of daily living (ADL). The secondary outcomes were postoperative pain scores, postoperative delirium, in-hospital cost, and major complications. RESULTS: The ADL scores of postoperative day 30 (POD30) in the CLSB group are higher than those in the SA group (27.34 +- 7.01 versus 24.70 +- 6.40, P=0.045). Compared to preoperative ADL scores, there were higher increased scores in the CLSB group than in POD30 (CLSB group 8.09 +- 3.39 versus SA group 4.87 +- 3.90, P < 0.001). Mild-to-moderate pain did not have differences between the two groups (rest pain: 3 versus 2, P=0.344; motion pain: 5 versus 4, P=0.073). There were no significant differences in incidence of postoperative delirium, PONV, and other complications. CONCLUSION: The unilateral SA can reduce the deterioration of ADL after hip fracture surgery and provide a better postoperative recovery.
