37944754|a|The heat shock response is a critical component of the inflammatory cascade that prevents misfolding of new proteins and regulates immune responses. Activation of CD4+ T cells causes an upregulation of heat shock transcription factor, heat shock factor 1 (HSF1). We hypothesized that HSF1 promotes a pro-regulatory phenotype during inflammation. To validate this hypothesis, we interrogated cell-specific HSF1 knockout mice and HSF1 transgenic mice using in vitro and in vivo techniques. We determined that while HSF1 expression was induced by anti-CD3 stimulation alone, the combination of anti-CD3 and TGFbeta, a vital cytokine for regulatory T cell (Treg) development, resulted in increased activating phosphorylation of HSF1, leading to increased nuclear translocation and binding to heat shock response elements. Using ChIP, we demonstrate direct binding of HSF1 to foxp3 in isolated murine CD4+ T cells, which in turn coincided with induction of FoxP3 expression. We defined that conditional knockout of HSF1 decreased development and function of Tregs and overexpression of HSF1 led to increased expression of FoxP3 along with enhanced Treg suppressive function. Adoptive transfer of CD45RBHigh CD4 colitogenic T cells along with HSF1 transgenic CD25+ Tregs prevented intestinal inflammation when WT Tregs did not. Finally, overexpression of HSF1 provided enhanced barrier function and protection from murine ileitis. This study demonstrates that HSF1 promotes Treg development and function and may represent both a crucial step in the development of induced regulatory T cells and an exciting target for the treatment of inflammatory diseases with a regulatory T cell component.
