35205102|t|miRNA-Profiling in Ejaculated and Epididymal Pig Spermatozoa and Their Relation to Fertility after Artificial Insemination.
35205102|a|MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding RNAs (20-25 nucleotides in length) capable of regulating gene expression by binding -fully or partially- to the 3'-UTR of target messenger RNA (mRNA). To date, several studies have investigated the role of sperm miRNAs in spermatogenesis and their remaining presence toward fertilization and early embryo development. However, little is known about the miRNA cargo in the different sperm sources and their possible implications in boar fertility. Here, we characterized the differential abundance of miRNAs in spermatozoa from the terminal segment of the epididymis and three different fractions of the pig ejaculate (sperm-peak, sperm-rich, and post-sperm rich) comparing breeding boars with higher (HF) and lower (LF) fertility after artificial insemination (AI) using high-output small RNA sequencing. We identified five sperm miRNAs that, to our knowledge, have not been previously reported in pigs (mir-10386, mir-10390, mir-6516, mir-9788-1, and mir-9788-2). Additionally, four miRNAs (mir-1285, mir-92a, mir-34c, mir-30), were differentially expressed among spermatozoa sourced from ejaculate fractions and the cauda epididymis, and also different abundance was found between HF and LF groups in mir-182, mir-1285, mir-191, and mir-96. These miRNAs target genes with key roles in fertility, sperm survival, immune tolerance, or cell cycle regulation, among others. Linking the current findings with the expression of specific sperm proteins would help predict fertility in future AI-sires.
