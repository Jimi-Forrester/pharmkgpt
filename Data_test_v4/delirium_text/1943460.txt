1943460|t|Action of amyloid beta-protein on protein kinase C activity.
1943460|a|Amyloid beta-protein (A beta), the major protein of cerebrovascular and plaque amyloid in Alzheimer disease, is considered a primary factor in the pathology of this disease. The effect of synthetic A beta (1-40) on the activity of protein kinase C (PKC) was studied with histones for a substrate in a mixed micellar assay, and with calmodulin-depleted soluble brain proteins in a liposomal system. We report here that A beta affects PKC activity in a biphasic manner. An initial stimulation of PKC was noted at low concentrations of A beta (less than 2.5 microM); while PKC-inhibition was observed in a concentration-dependent manner at higher concentrations of A beta. The in vitro phosphorylation of 20, 47, and 87 kDa brain proteins (known PKC substrates) was significantly reduced by 60 microM A beta. The role of 20 kDa in memory storage, of 87 kDa in neurotransmission and neurosecretory processes, and of 47 kDa in long-term potentiation or memory is well recognized, and A beta is known to have both neurotrophic and neurotoxic effects. Since PKC plays an important role in neuronal function, it is suggested that dual modulation of PKC by A beta may be linked to its neurotrophic and neurotoxic effects. We propose that at low concentrations A beta, by stimulating PKC, may contribute to neurites generation; and at higher concentrations A beta, by inhibiting PKC activity, might lead first to memory impairment, and then to neuronal loss.
