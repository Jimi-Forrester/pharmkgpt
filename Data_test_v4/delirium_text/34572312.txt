34572312|t|Alzheimer's Disease: A Molecular View of beta-Amyloid Induced Morbific Events.
34572312|a|Amyloid-beta (Abeta) is a dynamic peptide of Alzheimer's disease (AD) which accelerates the disease progression. At the cell membrane and cell compartments, the amyloid precursor protein (APP) undergoes amyloidogenic cleavage by beta- and gamma-secretases and engenders the Abeta. In addition, externally produced Abeta gets inside the cells by receptors mediated internalization. An elevated amount of Abeta yields spontaneous aggregation which causes organelles impairment. Abeta stimulates the hyperphosphorylation of tau protein via acceleration by several kinases. Abeta travels to the mitochondria and interacts with its functional complexes, which impairs the mitochondrial function leading to the activation of apoptotic signaling cascade. Abeta disrupts the Ca2+ and protein homeostasis of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi complex (GC) that promotes the organelle stress and inhibits its stress recovery machinery such as unfolded protein response (UPR) and ER-associated degradation (ERAD). At lysosome, Abeta precedes autophagy dysfunction upon interacting with autophagy molecules. Interestingly, Abeta act as a transcription regulator as well as inhibits telomerase activity. Both Abeta and p-tau interaction with neuronal and glial receptors elevate the inflammatory molecules and persuade inflammation. Here, we have expounded the Abeta mediated events in the cells and its cosmopolitan role on neurodegeneration, and the current clinical status of anti-amyloid therapy.
