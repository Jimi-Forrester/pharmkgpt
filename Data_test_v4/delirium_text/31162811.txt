31162811|a|Amyloid-like peptides are an ideal model for the mechanistic study of amyloidosis, which may lead to many human diseases, such as Alzheimer disease. This study reports a strong second harmonic generation (SHG) effect of amyloid-like peptides, having a signal equivalent to or even higher than those of endogenous collagen fibers. Several amyloid-like peptides (both synthetic and natural) were examined under SHG microscopy and shown they are SHG-active. These peptides can also be observed inside cells (in vitro). This interesting property can make these amyloid-like peptides second harmonic probes for bioimaging applications. Furthermore, SHG microscopy can provide a simple and label-free approach to detect amyloidosis. Lattice corneal dystrophy was chosen as a model disease of amyloidosis. Morphological difference between normal and diseased human corneal biopsy samples can be easily recognized, proving that SHG can be a useful tool for disease diagnosis.
