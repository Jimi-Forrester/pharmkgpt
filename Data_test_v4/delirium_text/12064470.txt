12064470|a|To better understand amyloid-beta (Abeta) metabolism in vivo, we assessed the concentration of Abeta in the CSF and plasma of APP(V717F) (PDAPP) transgenic mice, a model that develops age-dependent Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like pathology. In 3-month-old mice, prior to the development of Abeta deposition in the brain, there was a highly significant correlation between Abeta levels in CSF and plasma. In 9-month-old-mice, an age at which some but not all mice have developed Abeta deposition, there was also a significant correlation between CSF and plasma Abeta; however, the correlation was not as strong as that present in young mice. In further exploring CSF and plasma Abeta levels in 9-month-old mice, levels of CSF Abeta were found to correlate highly with Abeta burden. Analysis of the CSF: plasma Abeta ratio revealed a selective two-fold increase in plaque versus non-plaque bearing mice, strongly suggesting a plaque-mediated sequestration of soluble Abeta in brain. Interestingly, in 9-month-old mice, a significant correlation between CNS and plasma Abeta was limited to mice lacking Abeta deposition. These findings suggest that there is a dynamic equilibrium between CNS and plasma Abeta, and that plaques create a new equilibrium because soluble CNS Abeta not only enters the plasma but also deposits onto amyloid plaques in the CNS.
