38669526|t|go4cognition: Evaluation of a Newly Developed Multicomponent Intervention in Mild Cognitive Impairment.
38669526|a|Background: Cognitive training and physical exercise show positive effects on cognitive decline in subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Multimodal interventions for MCI patients, combining physical and cognitive training in a social context seem to slow down cognitive decline. Objective: Based on a previous study, a new mobile gamification tool (go4cognition; https://www.ontaris.de/go4cognition) has been developed to train cognitive and physical functions simultaneously in a group setting. It involves tasks targeting various cognitive functions (short-term memory, working memory, executive functions). The computer-based setup allows for individual performance analysis. This study evaluated the effects of this tool. Methods: 30 participants with MCI, as defined by the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) cut-off-score, aged between 66 and 89 years, trained for one hour two days a week for twelve weeks. Additionally, standard neuropsychological assessment of memory and attention was carried out before and after the intervention. Results: The go4cognition device is highly effective in improving various cognitive functions. A significant improvement in the CERAD total score resulting in re-classification of 70% of former MCI patients into non-MCI patients was found. Additionally, an improvement of verbal fluency, verbal memory, spatial memory, and attention was observed. Furthermore, the CERAD total score was significantly correlated with performance in the go4cognition tool. Conclusions: The results of the intervention support the idea of the effectiveness of a combined cognitive and motor intervention by incorporating neuropsychological paradigms in a group setting and suggest a close relation between combined cognitive and physical exercise and cognitive performance.
