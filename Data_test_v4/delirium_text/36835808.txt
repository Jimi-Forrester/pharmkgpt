36835808|t|Asymmetry of Gray- and White-Matter Volume and Metabolites in the Central-Vestibular System in Healthy Individuals.
36835808|a|This study was designed to determine whether there was an asymmetry of structure and neurochemical activity of the interhemispheric vestibular-cortical system between healthy individuals and patients with vestibular failure. Previous studies have identified differences in gray-matter-volume (GMV) and white-matter-volume (WMV) asymmetry in the central-vestibular system and in concentrations of brain metabolites in the parietal lobe 2 (PO2) between patients with vestibulopathy and healthy controls. However, a comparison of the left and right sides in the healthy controls has not been made conclusively. This study included 23 healthy right-handed volunteers, and was carried out between March 2016 and March 2020. A three-dimensional T1-weighted image was used to calculate the GMV and WMV of the central-vestibular network on both sides, and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H1MRS) was employed to analyze the brain metabolites in the PO2 area. The relative ratios of N-acetylaspartate (NAA)/tCr, tNAA/tCr, glycerophosphocholine (GPC)/tCr, Glx/tCr, and myo-inositol/tCr were quantified from the proton-MRS data. GMV and WMV differed significantly between the right and left vestibular-cortical regions. The GMVs of the right PO2, caudate, insula, and precuneus were significantly higher than those of the same locations on the left side; however, in the Rolandic operculum, the GMV on the left was significantly higher than on the right. In the PO2, Rolandic operculum, thalamus, and insula, the WMV on the left side was higher than on the right side of the corresponding location. However, the right caudate and precuneus WMV were higher than the left at the same location. In the H1MRS study, the Glx/tCr and GPC/tCr ratios on the left side were significantly higher than on the right. In comparison, the NAA/tCr and tNAA/tCr ratios showed contrasting results. The NAA/tCr ratio (r = -0.478, p = 0.021), tNAA/tCr ratio (r = -0.537, p = 0.008), and Glx/tCr ratio (r = -0.514, p = 0.012) on the right side showed a significant negative correlation with the participants' age. There was no relationship between GMV and metabolites on either side. Brain structure and concentrations of brain metabolites related to the vestibular system may differ between the two hemispheres in healthy individuals. Therefore, the asymmetry of the central-vestibular system should be considered when performing imaging.
