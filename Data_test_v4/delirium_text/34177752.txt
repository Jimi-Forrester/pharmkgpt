34177752|a|Objective: Mechanical thrombectomy (MT) has been an effective first-line therapeutic strategy for ischemic stroke. With impairment characteristics separating it from anterior circulation stroke, we aimed to explore prognostic structural neural markers for basilar artery occlusion (BAO) after MT. Methods: Fifty-four BAO patients with multi-modal magnetic resonance imaging at admission from the multicenter real-world designed BASILAR research were enrolled in this study. Features including volumes for cortical structures and subcortical regions, locations and volumes of infarctions, and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volumes were recorded from all individuals. The impact features were identified using ANCOVA and logistic analysis. Another cohort (n = 21) was further recruited to verify the prognostic roles of screened prognostic structures. Results: For the primary clinical outcome, decreased brainstem volume and total infarction volumes from mesencephalon and midbrain were significantly related to reduced 90-day modified Rankin score (mRS) after MT treatment. WMH volume, WMH grade, average cortex thickness, white matter volume, and gray matter volume did not exhibit a remarkable relationship with the prognosis of BAO. The increased left caudate volume was obviously associated with early symptomatic recovery after MT. The prognostic role of the ratio of pons and midbrain infarct volume in brainstem was further confirmed in another cohort with area under the curve (AUC) = 0.77. Conclusions: This study was the first to provide comprehensive structural markers for the prognostic evaluation of BAO. The fully automatic and semiautomatic segmentation approaches in our study supported that the proportion of mesencephalon and midbrain infarct volume in brainstem was a crucial prognostic structural neural marker for BAO.
