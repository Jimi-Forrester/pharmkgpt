37432372|a|Memory impairment is a characteristic of brain aging, and it is associated with a decrease in neurogenesis. Therefore, enhancing neurogenesis is a potential method for mitigating brain aging. Nobiletin (NOB) is a natural polymethoxylated flavonoid derived from citrus peels. It acts as an antioxidant, enhances anti-inflammation, and displays neuroprotective properties. However, the mechanism of NOB on brain aging has not been elucidated. In this study, D-galactose-induced aging mice were treated with NOB (100 mg/kg/day) for 10 weeks. NOB administration attenuated D-galactose-induced memory impairment and restored hippocampal neurogenesis, including the number of newborn neurons and neural stem cells in mice. Furthermore, it downregulated the pro-inflammatory mediators IL-1 beta, IL-6, and pP65 (by 42.2%, 22.9%, and 46.4% of those in the D-galactose treated group, respectively) in the hippocampus and blocked microglia and astrocyte activation. In vitro, NOB inhibited D-galactose-induced inflammatory responses in BV2 cells, and the conditioned medium prepared from NOB- and D-galactose-co-treated BV2 cells elevated the viability (90.3% of control) and differential ability (94.9% of control) of C17.2 cells, compared to the D-galactose-treated group alone. It was concluded that NOB could restore memory impairment via the improvement of neurogenesis by ameliorating neuroinflammation in the hippocampus. Overall, NOB is a potential candidate neurogenesis enhancer for improving brain function.
