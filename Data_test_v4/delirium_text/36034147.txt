36034147|t|Regional homogeneity alterations in multifrequency bands in patients with basal ganglia stroke: A resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging study.
36034147|a|Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the spontaneous regional neural activity abnormalities in patients with acute basal ganglia ischemic stroke (BGIS) using a multifrequency bands regional homogeneity (ReHo) method and to explore whether the alteration of ReHo values was associated with clinical characteristics. Methods: In this study, 34 patients with acute BGIS and 44 healthy controls (HCs) were recruited. All participants were examined by resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). The ReHo method was used to detect the alterations of spontaneous neural activities in patients with acute BGIS. A two-sample t-test comparison was performed to compare the ReHo value between the two groups, and a Pearson correlation analysis was conducted to assess the relationship between the regional neural activity abnormalities and clinical characteristics. Results: Compared with the HCs, the patients with acute BGIS showed increased ReHo in the left caudate and subregions such as the right caudate and left putamen in conventional frequency bands. In the slow-5 frequency band, patients with BGIS showed decreased ReHo in the left medial cingulum of BGIS compared to the HCs and other subregions such as bilateral caudate and left putamen. No brain regions with ReHo alterations were found in the slow-4 frequency band. Moreover, we found that the ReHo value of left caudate was positively correlated with the NIHSS score. Conclusion: Our findings revealed the alterations of ReHo in patients with acute BGIS in a specific frequency band and provided a new insight into the pathogenesis mechanism of BGIS. This study demonstrated the frequency-specific characteristics of ReHo in patients with acute BGIS, which may have a positive effect on the future neuroimaging studies.
