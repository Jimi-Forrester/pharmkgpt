36422495|t|Identification of sepsis-associated encephalopathy risk factors in elderly patients: a retrospective observational cohort study.
36422495|a|BACKGROUND: Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is a severe complication of sepsis that affects upwards of half of all sepsis patients. Few studies have examined the etiology and risk factors of SAE among elderly patients. This study was designed to explore the epidemiology of SAE and the risk factors associated with its development in elderly populations. METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of elderly sepsis patients admitted to our intensive care unit between January 2017 and January 2022. We then compared non-SAE and SAE groups concerning baseline clinicopathological findings, underlying diseases, infection site, disease type, disease severity, biochemical findings, and 28-day mortality. We further stratified patients in the SAE group based on whether or not they survived for 28 days, and we compared the above data between these groups. RESULTS: Of the 222 elderly sepsis patients, 132 (59.46%) had SAE. SAE patients were found to be significantly older than non-SAE patients. Both age and blood sodium concentrations were found to be associated with SAE risk, while elderly sepsis patients without underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have a relatively higher risk of developing SAE. The SAE group also had a significantly higher rate of 28-day mortality, and sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores were a risk factor associated with 28-day mortality. DISCUSSION: Among elderly sepsis patients, SAE risk increases with advancing age, higher blood sodium concentrations, and without underlying COPD. SAE incidence is associated with a poorer prognosis, and SOFA scores are independent predictors of increased mortality among elderly SAE patients.
