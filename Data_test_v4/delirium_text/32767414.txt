32767414|a|AIM: Many researchers argue that Alzheimer's disease is at least partly caused by deposition of amyloid beta (Abeta) in the brain. Ferulic acid (FA) and Angelica archangelica (AA) are candidate agents for reducing Abeta and improving cognitive function. Feru-guard 100M is a supplement containing FA and AA extract. Using this supplement, we planned to assess the effect of FA and AA on Abeta deposition in the human brain. METHODS: This was an open-label, interventional multi-institutional joint study of Kobe University and the Institute of Biomedical Research and Innovation (Kobe, Japan). Seventeen subjects diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment were divided into two groups: the intervention group (n = 10) and the control group (n = 7). The subjects in the intervention group used Feru-guard 100M every day for 48 weeks, whereas the subjects in the control group did not use the supplement. We assessed the differences between the two groups by examining Abeta deposition and brain atrophy at 48 weeks and cognitive function every 24 weeks. We used carbon-11-labelled Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) positron emission tomography to evaluate Abeta deposition. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in Abeta deposition, brain atrophy, and cognitive function between the two groups. Specifically, differences in Abeta deposition change in seven regions of interest examined with PiB positron emission tomography, brain atrophy change in four indicators of voxel-based morphometry, and cognitive impairment measured by five psychological tests were not significantly between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Treatment with Feru-guard 100M, a supplement containing FA and AA extract, for 48 weeks did not reduce cortical PiB retention, which reflects Abeta deposition. It also did not suppress the aggravation of brain atrophy or decline in cognitive function.
