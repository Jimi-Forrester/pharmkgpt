15339642|a|The amyloid hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) maintains that the accumulation of the amyloid beta protein (Abeta) is a critical event in disease pathogenesis. A great deal of both academic and commercial research has focused on the mechanisms by which Abeta is generated. However, investigations into the mechanisms underlying Abeta clearance have blossomed over the last several years. This minireview will summarize pathways involved in the removal of cerebral Abeta, including enzymatic degradation and receptor-mediated efflux out of the brain.
