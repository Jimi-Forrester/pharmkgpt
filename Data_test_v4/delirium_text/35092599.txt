35092599|a|INTRODUCTION: Opioid-tolerant patients are more likely to deviate from recommended treatments and to experience inadequate analgesia than opioid-naive ones. The aim of this study was to examine whether pharmacist-led management could help improve treatment adherence and quality of life. METHODS: Eligible patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to control group and intervention group. The control group received routine education and support, while the intervention group received additional individualized pharmacist-led care. The primary endpoint was treatment adherence in the per-protocol analysis, as evaluated by blinded assessors. An interim analysis was planned when 30% patients completed the study. Alpha was divided into the interim analysis (0.015) and the final analysis (0.035). RESULTS: In the interim analysis (97 and 87 patients in the control and intervention groups, respectively), the primary endpoint was met. Pharmacist-led intervention significantly increased treatment adherence (93.3 vs. 79.8%; OR: 2.25; 95% CI 1.02, 4.94; P = 0.013), quality of life (0.81 +- 0.17 vs. 0.72 +- 0.25; P = 0.008), and reporting of adverse events (82.7 vs. 61.9%; OR: 1.88; 95% CI 1.16, 3.07; P = 0.004). The two groups did not differ in pain control rate (66.7 vs. 57.1%; OR: 1.25; 95% CI 0.87, 1.78; P = 0.218), breakthrough pain-free rate (66.7 vs. 61.9%; OR: 1.12; 95% CI 0.78, 1.59; P = 0.532) and pain score (1.97 +- 1.04 vs. 2.15 +- 1.24; P = 0.522). CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacist-led management improved treatment adherence, quality of life, and the reporting of adverse events in opioid-tolerant patients with cancer pain.
