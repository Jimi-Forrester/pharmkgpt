39474868|a|Cells must rapidly adapt to changes in nutrient conditions through responsive signalling cascades to maintain homeostasis. One of these adaptive pathways results in the post-translational modification of proteins by O-GlcNAc. O-GlcNAc modifies thousands of nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins in response to nutrient availability through the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway. O-GlcNAc is highly dynamic and can be added and removed from proteins multiple times throughout their life cycle, setting it up to be an ideal regulator of cellular processes in response to metabolic changes. Here, we describe the link between cellular metabolism and O-GlcNAc, and we explore O-GlcNAc's role in regulating cellular processes in response to nutrient levels. Specifically, we discuss the mechanisms of elevated O-GlcNAc levels in contributing to diabetes and cancer, as well as the role of decreased O-GlcNAc levels in neurodegeneration. These studies form a foundational understanding of aberrant O-GlcNAc in human disease and provide an opportunity to further improve disease identification and treatment.
