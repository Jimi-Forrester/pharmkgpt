39414620|a|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of bladder irrigation (BI) with tap water to reduce antibiotic use for the treatment of urinary tract infections (UTIs) in patients with recurrent UTI symptoms and to assess the treatment satisfaction of BI. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This prospective, observational study included patients with an indwelling catheter or performing clean intermittent catheterisation (CIC) who had recurrent UTI symptoms between July 2022 and March 2024. BI with tap water was used for the treatment of UTIs without systemic symptoms (e.g., fever, flank pain or delirium). Patients started daily irrigation at the onset of UTI symptoms and used a tapering schedule. The number of antibiotic treatments for UTIs, UTI incidence rate ratio (IRR), UTI-related hospitalisations, treatment satisfaction and quality of life (QoL) were compared between a 3-month period before and after BI with tap water. RESULTS: A total of 60 patients were included with a median (interquartile range) age of 64.5 (50.4-72.6) years, 66.7% were male, and 83.3% were performing CIC. Antibiotic use was decreased on average by 38.1% (IRR = 0.62; P = 0.016) and catheter-associated UTIs by 37.9% (IRR = 0.62; P = 0.005). No increase was observed in the incidence of UTIs with systemic symptoms or UTI-related hospitalisations. In addition, no differences were observed in the health-related QoL. The majority of patients were positive about the subjective effectiveness (81%), ease of use (86%) and overall satisfaction (85%) of BI with tap water. CONCLUSION: These findings emphasise the potential of BI with tap water as a promising and patient-friendly alternative for the treatment of UTIs in patients with urinary catheters. BI with tap water significantly reduces antibiotic use and UTI incidence in patients with recurrent UTIs and is a safe and patient-friendly alternative that can be easily implemented in the management of UTIs.
