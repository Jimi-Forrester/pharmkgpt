37554600|t|General Anesthetic Care of Obese Patients Undergoing Surgery: A Review of Current Anesthetic Considerations and Recent Advances.
37554600|a|Obesity has long been linked to adverse health effects over time. As the prevalence of obesity continues to rise, it is important to anticipate and minimize the complications that obesity brings in the anesthesia setting during surgery. Anesthetic departments must recognize the innumerable risks when managing patients with obesity undergoing surgery, including anatomical and physiological changes as well as comorbidities such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and malignancies. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to analyze the current literature and evaluate the current and recent advances in anesthetic care of obese patients undergoing surgery, to better understand the specific challenges this patient population faces. A greater understanding of the differences between anesthetic care for obese patients can help to improve patient care and the specificity of treatment. The examination of the literature will focus on differing patient outcomes and safety precautions in obese patients as compared to the general population. Specifically highlighting the differences in pre-operative, intra-operative, and post-operative care, with the aim to identify issues and present possible solutions.
