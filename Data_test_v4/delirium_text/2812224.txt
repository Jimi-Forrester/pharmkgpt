2812224|t|Role of neurotrophic factors in Alzheimer's disease.
2812224|a|Neurotrophic factors (NTFs) could potentially play a role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) in many ways. Neuronal degeneration may result from disruption in NTF production, delivery, or interaction with the neuronal target. Even if alterations in NTF function are not responsible for neuronal degeneration, NTFs may still be therapeutically useful in ameliorating some morphological or cognitive deficits observed in AD.
