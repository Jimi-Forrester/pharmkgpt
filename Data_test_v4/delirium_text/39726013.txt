39726013|a|In recent years, a growing body of research has unveiled the involvement of the necroptosis pathway in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This evidence has shed light on the mechanisms underlying neuronal death in AD, positioning necroptosis at the forefront as a potential target for therapeutic intervention. This review provides an update on the current knowledge on this emerging, yet rapidly advancing topic, encompassing all published studies that present supporting proof of the role of the necroptosis pathway in the neurodegenerative processes of AD. The implication of misfolded tau and amyloid-beta (Abeta) aggregates is highlighted, with evidence suggesting their direct or indirect involvement in necroptosis activation. In summary, the review underscores the significance of understanding the complex interplay between necroptosis, protein aggregates, and neurodegeneration in AD. The findings advocate for a comprehensive approach, combining therapeutic and early diagnostic strategies, to intervene in the disease process before irreversible damage occurs.
