36079834|t|Contribution of Advanced Glycation End Products to PCOS Key Elements: A Narrative Review.
36079834|a|In the last decade, data has suggested that dietary advanced glycation end products (AGEs) play an important role in both reproductive and metabolic dysfunctions associated with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). AGEs are highly reactive molecules that are formed by the non-enzymatic glycation process between reducing sugars and proteins, lipids, or nucleic acids. They can be formed endogenously under normal metabolic conditions or under abnormal situations such as diabetes, renal disease, and other inflammatory disorders. Bodily AGEs can also accumulate from exogenous dietary sources particularly when ingested food is cooked and processed under high-temperature conditions, such as frying, baking, or grilling. Women with PCOS have elevated levels of serum AGEs that are associated with insulin resistance and obesity and that leads to a high deposition of AGEs in the ovarian tissue causing anovulation and hyperandrogenism. This review will describe new data relevant to the role of AGEs in several key elements of PCOS phenotype and pathophysiology. Those elements include ovarian dysfunction, hyperandrogenemia, insulin resistance, and obesity. The literature findings to date suggest that targeting AGEs and their cellular actions could represent a novel approach to treating PCOS symptoms.
