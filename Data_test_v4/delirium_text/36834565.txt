36834565|t|Biomarkers in the Rat Hippocampus and Peripheral Blood for an Early Stage of Mental Disorders Induced by Water Immersion Stress.
36834565|a|It is difficult to evaluate the pre-symptomatic state of mental disorders and prevent its onset. Since stress could be a trigger of mental disorders, it may be helpful to identify stress-responsive biomarkers (stress markers) for the evaluation of stress levels. We have so far performed omics analyses of the rat brain and peripheral blood after various kinds of stress and have found numerous factors that respond to stress. In this study, we investigated the effects of relatively moderate stress on these factors in the rat to identify stress marker candidates. Adult male Wistar rats underwent water immersion stress for 12 h, 24 h, or 48 h. Stress caused weight loss and elevated serum corticosterone levels, and alterations regarded as anxiety and/or fear-like behaviors. Reverse-transcription PCR and Western blot analyses revealed significant alterations in the expressions of hippocampal genes and proteins by the stress for no longer than 24 h, such as mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase 1 (MKP-1), CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein delta (CEBPD), small ubiquitin-like modifier proteins 1/sentrin-specific peptidase 5 (SENP5), matrix metalloproteinase-8 (MMP-8), kinase suppressor of Ras 1 (KSR1), and MKP-1, MMP-8, nerve growth factor receptor (NGFR). Similar alterations were observed in three genes (MKP-1, CEBPD, MMP-8) in the peripheral blood. The present results strongly suggest that these factors may serve as stress markers. The correlation of these factors in the blood and brain may enable the evaluation of stress-induced changes in the brain by blood analysis, which will contribute to preventing the onset of mental disorders.
