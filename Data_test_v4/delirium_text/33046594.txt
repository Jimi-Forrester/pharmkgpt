33046594|a|OBJECTIVE: Minimally invasive surgery is increasingly adopted as an alternative to conventional sternotomy for mitral valve pathology in many centres worldwide. A systematic safety analysis based on a comprehensive list of pre-specified 30-day complications defined by the Mitral Valve Academic Consortium (MVARC) criteria is lacking. The aim of the current study was to systematically analyse the safety of minimally invasive mitral valve surgery in our centre based on the MVARC definitions. METHODS: All consecutive patients undergoing minimally invasive mitral valve surgery through right mini-thoracotomy in our institution within 10 years were studied retrospectively. The primary outcome was a composite of 30-day major complications based on MVARC definitions. RESULTS: 745 patients underwent minimally invasive mitral valve surgery (507 repair, 238 replacement), with a mean age of 62.9+-12.3 years. The repair was successful in 95.8%. Overall 30-day mortality was 1.2% and stroke rate 0.3%. Freedom from any 30-day major complications was 87.2%, and independent predictors were left ventricular ejection fraction <50% (OR 1.78; 95% CI 1.02 to 3.02) and estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 (OR 1.98; 95% CI 1.17 to 3.26). CONCLUSIONS: Minimally invasive mitral valve surgery is a safe technique and is associated with low 30-day mortality and stroke rate.
