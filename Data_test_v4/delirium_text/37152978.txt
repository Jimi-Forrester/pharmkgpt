37152978|a|Background: Sodium leak channel non-selective (NALCN), known as a voltage-independent Na+ channel, is increasingly considered to play vital roles in tumorigenesis and metastasis of human cancers. However, no comprehensive pan-cancer analysis of NALCN has been conducted. Our study aims to explore the potential diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic value of NALCN in human cancers. Methods: Through comprehensive application of datasets from Human Protein Atlas (HPA), The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE), Enhanced Version of Tumor Immune Estimation Resource (TIMER2.0), Tumor and Immune System Interaction Database (TISIDB), The University of Alabama at Birmingham Cancer data analysis Portal (UALCAN), cBioPortal, GeneMANIA and Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interaction Gene/Proteins (STRING) databases, we explored the potential roles of NALCN in different cancers. The differential expression, prognostic implications, pathological stages and grades, molecular and immune subtypes, diagnostic accuracy, tumor mutation burden (TMB), microsatellite instability (MSI), mismatch repair (MMR) genes, immune checkpoint genes, chemokine genes, major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-related genes, tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TIICs), promoter methylation, mutations, copy number alteration (CNA), and functional enrichment related to NALCN were analyzed. Results: Most cancers lowly expressed NALCN. Upregulated NALCN expression was associated with poor or better prognosis in different cancers. Moreover, NALCN was correlated with clinicopathological features in multiple cancers. NALCN showed high diagnostic accuracy in 5 caner types. NALCN is highly linked with immune-related biomarkers, immune-related genes and TIICs. Significant methylation changes and genetic alteration of NALCN can be observed in many cancers. Enrichment analysis showed that NALCN is closely related to multiple tumor-related signaling pathways. Conclusion: Our study revealed the vital involvement of NALCN in cancer. NALCN can be used as a prognostic biomarker for immune infiltration and clinical outcomes, and has potential diagnostic and therapeutic implications.
