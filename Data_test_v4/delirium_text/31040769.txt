31040769|t|Lower Posttraumatic alpha-Synuclein Level Associated With Altered Default Mode Network Connectivity Following Acute Mild Traumatic Brain Injury.
31040769|a|This study aimed to investigate the changes of alpha-synuclein in serum and its relationship with default mode network (DMN) connectivity after acute mild traumatic brain injury (mild TBI). Fifty-two patients with mild TBI at the acute phase and 47 matched healthy controls were enrolled in the study. All participants received resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and neuropsychological assessments. Relations between the levels of alpha-synuclein in serum and clinical assessments were obtained using multivariate linear regression. Results showed that the patients with lower alpha-synuclein presented more complaints on post-concussion symptoms and depression. Moreover, patients with high levels of alpha-synuclein exhibited significantly decreased functional connectivity in the left precuneus and increased functional connectivity in both the left anterior cingulate cortex and ventro-medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) compared with patients with low levels of alpha-synuclein. These findings supported that alpha-synuclein may modulate the functional connectivity within the DMN and suggest the feasibility of using alpha-synuclein as an objective biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis of mild TBI.
