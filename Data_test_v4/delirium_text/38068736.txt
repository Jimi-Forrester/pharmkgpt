38068736|a|BACKGROUND: Common ginsenosides can be transformed into rare ginsenosides through microbial fermentation, and some rare ginsenosides can prevent Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study aimed to transform common ginsenosides into rare ginsenosides through solid-state fermentation of American ginseng stems and leaves (AGSL) by an endophytic fungus and to explore whether fermented saponin extracts prevent AD. METHODS: The powders of AGSL were fermented in a solid state by endophytic fungus. Total saponins were extracted from fermentation products using the methanol extraction method. The types of saponins were analyzed by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC/MS). The Abeta42 concentration and beta-secretase activity were measured by ELISA for the prevention of AD. RESULTS: After AGSL was fermented by an endophytic fungus NSJG, the total saponin concentration of the fermented extract G-SL was higher than the unfermented CK-SL. Rare ginsenoside Rh1 was newly produced and the yield of compound K (561.79%), Rh2 (77.48%), and F2 (40.89%) was increased in G-SL. G-SL had a higher inhibition rate on Abeta42 concentration (42.75%) and beta-secretase activity (42.22%) than CK-SL, possibly because the rare ginsenoside Rh1, Rh2, F2, and compound K included in it have a strong inhibitory effect on AD. CONCLUSION: The fermented saponin extracts of AGSL show more inhibition effects on AD and may be promising therapeutic drugs or nutrients for AD.
