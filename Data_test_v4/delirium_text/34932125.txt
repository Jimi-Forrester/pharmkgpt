34932125|a|Long-term management after stroke has not been standardized in contrast to acute and rehabilitative stroke care. The fragmented outpatient sector of healthcare allows a high degree of flexibility but also variability in the quality of care provided. The commission on long-term stroke care of the German Stroke Society developed a concept on how to provide standardized multiprofessional long-term stroke care with a focus on patient-centered comprehensive care. We propose a diagnostic work-up in stages, with an initial patient-reported screening, followed by an adapted in-depth assessment of affected domains. This includes internistic domains (management of risk factors) and also genuine neurological domains (spasticity, cognitive deficits etc.) that must be considered. This information is then merged with patient expectations and prioritization to a standardized treatment plan. Special challenges for the implementation of such a comprehensive care system are the intersectoral and intrasectoral communication between healthcare providers, patients and relatives, the need to create a compensation system for providers and the establishment of appropriate quality management services. Digital health applications are helpful tools to provide aspects of diagnostics, treatment and communication in long-term stroke care.
