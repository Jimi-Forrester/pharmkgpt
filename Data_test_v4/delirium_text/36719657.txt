36719657|t|Certified Nursing Assistants' Perspectives on Delirium Care.
36719657|a|The current descriptive qualitative study provides an in-depth understanding of the perspectives of certified nursing assistants (CNAs, N = 7) regarding delirium. Data were collected through interviews with seven CNAs working in a long-term care facility. Five themes emerged: Knowledge About Delirium, Caring for Residents With Delirium, Delirium Education, Psychological Burden, and Quality of Care. CNAs' care of residents with delirium was based on prior experiences and gut feelings, indicating a high need for delirium training. [Journal of Gerontological Nursing, 49(2), 43-51.].
