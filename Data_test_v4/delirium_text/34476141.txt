34476141|t|Could Interscalene Block Possibly be Protective Against Cerebral Ischemia During Shoulder Surgery in a Beach Chair Position?
34476141|a|Introduction Arthroscopic shoulder surgeries are usually performed in a sitting position. The sitting position is known to cause physiological changes related to cardiovascular adaptation. Interscalene nerve blocks (ISB) are the most commonly used techniques and are considered gold standard regional anesthesia methods for shoulder surgeries. Cerebral vessels located around sympathetic ganglia provide sympathetic system integrity. This local anesthetic spreading during ISB could be a side effect or provide a protective effect on cerebral ischemia. Our study aimed to investigate the cerebral protective effect of the ISB in arthroscopic shoulder surgeries in a sitting position. Material and methods After the approval of Koc University Clinical Research Ethics Committee (2020.020.IRB1.011), records of patients between January and December 2019 with shoulder arthroscopy at the Vehbi Koc Foundation (VKV) American hospital were retrospectively reviewed. Records of the hemodynamic response, INVOSTM (Medtronic, Minneapolis, USA) (rSO2) parameters, pain scores, and additional analgesic needs of all cases were examined in the intraoperative and postoperative period. Results Data of 40 patients who met the criteria to be included in the study was analyzed. Our study showed that the sitting position leading to hypotension coincided with a decrease in INVOS values. Nevertheless, we did not record any significant hypotension after ISB, and this may be due to the use of a minimal dose of local anesthetic. There was a certain increase in near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) values after ISB. We saw that the value of regional oxygen saturation (rSO2) increased on both the ISB side and the non-ISB side. This shows that the ISB can have a global impact on the brain. Specificially, the increase in rSO2 values in the ISB side compared to the other side suggests that ISB has possible positive effects on cerebral blood flow. Conclusion Our study has shown that ISB may transiently increase the rSO2 levels in the sitting position during shoulder surgery.
