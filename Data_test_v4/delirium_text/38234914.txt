38234914|t|Replication of previous autism-GWAS hits suggests the association between NAA1, SORCS3, and GSDME and autism in the Han Chinese population.
38234914|a|Background: Autism is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by social interaction deficits, impairments in communication, and restricted and repetitive stereotyped behavior and activities. Family and twin studies suggested an essential role of genetic factors in the etiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Also, other studies found SORCS3 and GSDME (DFNA5) might be involved in brain development and susceptible to ASD. Methods: In this study, 17 genome-wide significant SNPs reported in previous ASD genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and 7 SNPs in strong linkage disequilibrium with known ASD GWAS hits were selected to investigate the association between these SNPs and autism in the Han Chinese population. Then, 10 tagSNPs in SORCS3 and 11 tagSNPs in GSDME were selected to analyze the association between these SNPs and autism. The selected 24 SNPs and tagSNPs were genotyped using the Agena MassARRAY SNP genotyping assay in 757 Han Chinese autism trios. Results: Rs1484144 in NAA11 was significantly associated with autism; significance remained after the Bonferroni correction (P < 0.0022). Also, rs79879286, rs12154597, and rs12540919 near GSDME, as well as rs9787523 and rs3750261 in SORCS3, were nominally associated with autism. Conclusion: Our study suggests that rs1484144 in NAA11 is a significant SNP for autism in the Han Chinese population, while SORCS3 and GSDME might be the susceptibility genes for autism in this population.
