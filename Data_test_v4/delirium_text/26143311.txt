26143311|a|Synthetic cannabinoids (SC) have exploded on to the scene. With this rise in SC use, the number of complications and potential adverse effects are also well documented in the literature and is on the rise. The most frequently cited side effects are behavioral in nature and range for severe agitation to psychosis and delirium. We report a case of hyperthermia with severe rhabdomyolysis from SC use.
