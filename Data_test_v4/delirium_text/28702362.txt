28702362|t|A Unique Case of Spontaneous Bilateral Renal Subcapsular Urinoma Secondary to High Pressure Chronic Retention of Urine.
28702362|a|Subcapsular urinomas have been reported in the past as a presenting feature of ureteric or bladder outlet obstruction, generally in children, and often associated with neurogenic bladders. We describe a case of spontaneous asymptomatic bilateral subcapsular urinomas in an adult male with high pressure retention of urine secondary to bladder outlet obstruction. An extensive literature review shows this to be a unique case.
