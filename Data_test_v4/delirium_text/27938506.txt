27938506|t|MicroRNA-98 Plays a Suppressive Role in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Through Inhibition of SALL4 Protein Expression.
27938506|a|MicroRNAs (miRs) have been demonstrated to be significantly associated with the development and progression of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the underlying mechanism of miR-98 in mediating the malignant phenotypes of NSCLC cells remains obscure. In this study, we found that miR-98 was significantly downregulated in NSCLC tissues compared to nontumor lung tissues. Downregulation of miR-98 was significantly associated with poor differentiation and advanced clinical stage. Restoration of miR-98 expression significantly decreased the proliferation, migration, and invasion of NSCLC A549 and H1229 cells. SALL4 was identified as a target gene of miR-98, and the protein expression of SALL4 was negatively regulated by miR-98 in NSCLC A549 and H1229 cells. Overexpression of SALL4 promoted A549 and H1229 cell proliferation, migration, and invasion and reversed the suppressive effects of miR-98 on the malignant phenotypes of A549 and H1229 cells. Moreover, SALL4 was found to be significantly upregulated in NSCLC tissues compared to the nontumor lung tissues. We then observed an inverse correlation between the miR-98 and SALL4 levels in NSCLC tissues. In vivo study revealed that miR-98 overexpression suppressed NSCLC growth. In summary, we demonstrate that miR-98 acts as a tumor suppressor in NSCLC cells by inhibiting the protein expression of its target gene SALL4. Therefore, our study highlights the importance of the miR-98/SALL4 axis in NSCLC.
