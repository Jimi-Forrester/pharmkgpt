36140385|t|Association of Hypernatremia with Immune Profiles and Clinical Outcomes in Adult Intensive Care Unit Patients with Sepsis.
36140385|a|Both hypernatremia and an abnormal immune response may increase hospital mortality in patients with sepsis. This study examined the association of hypernatremia with abnormal immune response and mortality in 520 adult patients with sepsis in an intensive care unit (ICU). We compared the mortality and ex vivo lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory response differences among patients with hyponatremia, eunatremia, and hypernatremia, as well as between patients with acquired hypernatremia on ICU day 3 and those with sustained eunatremia over first three ICU days. Compared with eunatremia or hyponatremia, hypernatremia led to higher 7 day, 14 day, 28 day, and hospital mortality rates (p = 0.030, 0.009, 0.010, and 0.033, respectively). Compared with sustained eunatremia, acquired hypernatremia led to higher 7, 14, and 28 day mortality rates (p = 0.019, 0.042, and 0.028, respectively). The acquired hypernatremia group nonsignificantly trended toward increased hospital mortality (p = 0.056). Day 1 granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha levels were relatively low in patients with hypernatremia (p = 0.020 and 0.010, respectively) but relatively high in patients with acquired hypernatremia (p = 0.049 and 0.009, respectively). Thus, in ICU-admitted septic patients, hypernatremia on admission and in ICU-acquired hypernatremia were both associated with higher mortality. The higher mortality in patients with hypernatremia on admission was possibly related to the downregulation of G-CSF and TNF-alpha secretion after endotoxin stimulation. Compared to sustained eunatremia, acquired hypernatremia showed immunoparalysis at first and then hyperinflammation on day 3.
