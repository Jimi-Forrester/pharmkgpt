37513300|t|Anti-Inflammatory Effects of Dietary Polyphenols through Inhibitory Activity against Metalloproteinases.
37513300|a|Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are zinc-dependent metalloproteinases that play important roles in a variety of diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, and brain diseases. Dietary polyphenols are thought to have a variety of beneficial effects on these diseases characterized by inflammation. Clinical studies have demonstrated that MMPs are in most cases upregulated in various inflammatory diseases, including osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and Alzheimer's disease. Studies using patient-derived human samples, animal studies, and cellular experiments have suggested that polyphenols may be beneficial against inflammatory diseases by suppressing MMP gene expression and enzyme activity. One important mechanism by which polyphenols exert their activity is the downregulation of reactive oxygen species that promote MMP expression. Another important mechanism is the direct binding of polyphenols to MMPs and their inhibition of enzyme activity. Molecular docking analyses have provided a structural basis for the interaction between polyphenols and MMPs and will help to explore new polyphenol-based drugs with anti-inflammatory properties.
