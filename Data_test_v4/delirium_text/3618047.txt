3618047|a|The results of the clinical analysis of the disease course in 35 patients with atherosclerotic dementia attended by marked Parkinsonism were collated in the respective parameters of 40 patients of the control group (atherosclerotic dementia without significant extrapyramidal disorders). Comparison of premorbid pathoplastic factors indicates significant predominance of head injuries and neuroinfections in the test group. Two types of dementia with extrapyramidal abnormalities are described: domination of asthenodepressive, hypochondriac symptomatology and predominance of stheno-explosive manifestations not infrequently resulting in delirium. Proceeding from the peculiarities of affectivity, inclinations, self-evaluation and criticism in combination with characteristic intellectual-mnemonic impairments, the authors validate the relative independence of the studied variant of atherosclerotic imbecility.
