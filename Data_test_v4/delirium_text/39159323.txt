39159323|a|PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to describe nurses' experiences of the prerequisites for implementing family-centered care to prevent pediatric delirium. DESIGN: The research employed a qualitative, descriptive study design. METHODS: A total of 10 nurses working in the pediatric intensive care unit at 1 university hospital participated in the study. The quality data were collected using individual semistructured interviews, and the data were then analyzed by inductive content analysis. RESULTS: The prerequisites for implementing family-centered care to prevent delirium among pediatric patients consisted of 30 subcategories that were grouped into 11 generic categories. The generic categories were further grouped into 5 main categories: (1) an environment that supports family presence, (2) psychosocial support for the family, (3) individual family involvement, (4) family participation in shared decision-making, and (5) nurses' professional competence. CONCLUSIONS: According to the nurses' experiences, the implementation of a family-centered approach to preventing delirium in pediatric patients requires creating a supportive environment for families, providing psychosocial support, encouraging family involvement in decision-making, and ensuring that all nurses have the necessary skills.
