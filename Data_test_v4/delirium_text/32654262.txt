32654262|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) represents a devastating progressive neurodegenerative disease with a complex pathophysiology, affecting millions of people worldwide. Recent epigenome-wide association studies suggest a key role for epigenetic mechanisms in its development and course. Despite the fact that current evidence on the role of epigenetic dysregulation in aging and AD is convincing, the pioneering field of neuroepigenetics is still facing many challenges that need to be addressed to fundamentally increase our understanding about the underlying mechanisms of this neurodegenerative disorder. This perspective paper describes the current state of play for epigenetic research into AD and discusses how new methodological advances in the field of epigenetics and related data science disciplines could further spur the development of novel therapeutic agents and biomarker assays.
