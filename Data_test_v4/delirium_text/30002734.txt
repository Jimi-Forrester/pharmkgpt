30002734|t|Association of adiponectin with cognitive function precedes overt diabetes in the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Adult Health: ELSA.
30002734|a|BACKGROUND: Adiponectin is an insulin-sensitizer adipocytokine endowed with neuroprotective actions. Whether adiponectin regulates neuronal functioning toward delaying cognitive decline independently of the glucose metabolism disturbance has been poorly explored. This study evaluated if the performance in cognitive tests was associated with adiponectin levels prior the development of type 2 diabetes in middle-aged individuals. METHODS: A sample of 938 non-diabetic participants of ELSA had their cognitive function assessed by the CERAD delayed word recall test, the verbal fluency test and the trail making test. Stepwise multiple linear regression using forward selection had the response to cognitive tests as the dependent variable and adiponectin as the independent variable of main interest, adjusted for glucose tolerance status and confounders. RESULTS: Mean age was 45.7 +- 4.9 years, 54.5% were women, 43.0% had high education level, 59.3% weight excess and 70.0% prediabetes. In crude model, only the delayed recall memory was associated with adiponectin levels. In an initial regression model, delayed recall memory remained independently associated with adiponectin levels and prediabetes. After complete adjustments, adiponectin but not prediabetes maintained independently associated with delayed recall memory (beta 0.067; 95% CI 0.006-0.234; p = 0.040). On the other hand, learning memory showed to be associated with prediabetes (beta 0.71 95% CI 0.17; 1.24; p = 0.009) but not with adiponectin. CONCLUSIONS: The association of memory with adiponectin in middle-aged individuals, prior overt diabetes, suggests that this adipocytokine could anticipate cognitive impairmentrho detection, when preventive strategies could be more effectively implemented. The usefulness of adiponectin to identify increased risk for cognitive dysfunction before advanced age needs to be prospectively investigated in ELSA cohort.
