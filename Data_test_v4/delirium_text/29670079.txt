29670079|a|The role of astrocyte elevated gene-1 (AEG-1) in nigral dopaminergic (DA) neurons has not been studied. Here we report that the expression of AEG-1 was significantly lower in DA neurons in the postmortem substantia nigra of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) compared to age-matched controls. Similarly, decreased AEG-1 levels were found in the 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) mouse model of PD. An adeno-associated virus-induced increase in the expression of AEG-1 attenuated the 6-OHDA-triggered apoptotic death of nigral DA neurons. Moreover, the neuroprotection conferred by the AEG-1 upregulation significantly intensified the neurorestorative effects of the constitutively active ras homolog enriched in the brain [Rheb(S16H)]. Collectively, these results demonstrated that the sustained level of AEG-1 as an important anti-apoptotic factor in nigral DA neurons might potentiate the therapeutic effects of treatments, such as Rheb(S16H) administration, on the degeneration of the DA pathway that characterizes PD.
