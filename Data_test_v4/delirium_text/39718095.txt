39718095|t|Exosomes: intriguing mediators of intercellular communication in the organism's response to noxious agents.
39718095|a|Exosomes are small extracellular vesicles that range from 30 to 150 nm in size and are formed through cellular endocytosis. They consist of proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids at varying ratios and quantities. The composition and spatiotemporal dynamics of exosomes suggest that they play a crucial role in intercellular communication. The information conveyed by exosomes significantly impacts the regulation of health and disease states in the organism. The term "noxious" refers to all harmful environmental agents and conditions that can disrupt the physiological equilibrium and induce pathological states, regardless whether of radiological, biological, or chemical origin. This review comprehensively examines the presence of such noxious agents within the organism in relation to exosome formation and function. Furthermore, it explores the cause-effect relationship between noxious agents and exosomes, aiming to restore physiological homeostasis and prepare the organism for defence against harmful agents. Regardless of the specific bioinformatic content associated with each noxious agent, synthesis of data on the interactions between various types of noxious agents and exosomes reveals that an organized defence against these agents is unachievable without the support of exosomes. Consequently, exosomes are identified as the primary communication and information system within an organism, with their content being pivotal in maintaining the health-disease balance.
