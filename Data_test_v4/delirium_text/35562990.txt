35562990|t|Roles of Neuropeptides in Sleep-Wake Regulation.
35562990|a|Sleep and wakefulness are basic behavioral states that require coordination between several brain regions, and they involve multiple neurochemical systems, including neuropeptides. Neuropeptides are a group of peptides produced by neurons and neuroendocrine cells of the central nervous system. Like traditional neurotransmitters, neuropeptides can bind to specific surface receptors and subsequently regulate neuronal activities. For example, orexin is a crucial component for the maintenance of wakefulness and the suppression of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. In addition to orexin, melanin-concentrating hormone, and galanin may promote REM sleep. These results suggest that neuropeptides play an important role in sleep-wake regulation. These neuropeptides can be divided into three categories according to their effects on sleep-wake behaviors in rodents and humans. (i) Galanin, melanin-concentrating hormone, and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide are sleep-promoting peptides. It is also noticeable that vasoactive intestinal polypeptide particularly increases REM sleep. (ii) Orexin and neuropeptide S have been shown to induce wakefulness. (iii) Neuropeptide Y and substance P may have a bidirectional function as they can produce both arousal and sleep-inducing effects. This review will introduce the distribution of various neuropeptides in the brain and summarize the roles of different neuropeptides in sleep-wake regulation. We aim to lay the foundation for future studies to uncover the mechanisms that underlie the initiation, maintenance, and end of sleep-wake states.
