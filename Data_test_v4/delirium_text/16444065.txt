16444065|a|The growth hormone-insulin like growth factor (GH-IGF) axis plays a crucial role in the regulation of growth. Initially considered to be a mediator of growth hormone actions, IGF axis has been established as an independent endocrine system with wide array of actions. Recent advances have led to tremendous increase in the clinical utility of the IGF axis. IGF-based investigations (IGF1 and IGF binding protein 3) are now replacing GH-based investigations for evaluation and monitoring of disorders of the GH-IGF axis. IGF therapy has been successfully utilized in growth hormone insensitivity syndrome and GHD type 1B. The possibility of IGF axis as therapeutic options is being explored in wide variety of disorders like hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, Alzheimer's disease and psoriasis.
