37607902|a|Endometriosis is strongly associated with infertility. Several mechanisms have been reported in an attempt to elucidate the pathophysiological effects that lead to reduced fertility in women with endometriosis. However, the mechanisms by which endometriosis affects fertility have not been fully elucidated. Ferroptosis is a novel form of nonapoptotic cell death that is characterized by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation membrane damage. In past reports, elevated iron levels in ectopic lesions, peritoneal fluid and follicular fluid have been reported in patients with endometriosis. The high-iron environment is closely associated with ferroptosis, which appears to exhibit a double-edged effect on endometriosis. Ferroptosis can cause damage to ovarian granulosa cells, oocytes, and embryos, leading to endometriosis-related infertility. This article summarizes the main pathways and regulatory mechanisms of ferroptosis and explores the possible mechanisms of the formation of an iron-overloaded environment in endometriotic ectopic lesions, peritoneal fluid and follicular fluid. Finally, we reviewed recent studies on the main and potential mechanisms of ferroptosis in endometriosis and endometriosis-related infertility.
