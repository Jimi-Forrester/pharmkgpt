33724164|t|alpha- Linolenic acid modulates phagocytosis and endosomal pathways of extracellular Tau in microglia.
33724164|a|Microglia, the resident immune cells, were found to be activated to inflammatory phenotype in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The extracellular burden of amyloid-beta plaques and Tau seed fabricate the activation of microglia. The seeding effect of extracellular Tau species is an emerging aspect to study about Tauopathies in AD. Tau seeds enhance the propagation of disease along with its contribution to microglia-mediated inflammation. The excessive neuroinflammation cumulatively hampers phagocytic function of microglia reducing the clearance of extracellular protein aggregates. Omega-3 fatty acids, especially docosahexaenoic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid, are recognized to induce anti-inflammatory phenotype of microglia. In addition to increased cytokine production, omega-3 fatty acids enhance phagocytic receptors expression in microglia. In this study, we have observed the phagocytosis of extracellular Tau in the presence of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA). The increased phagocytosis of extracellular Tau monomer and aggregates have been observed upon ALA exposure to microglia cells. After internalization, the degradation status of Tau has been studied with early and late endosomal markers Rab5 and Rab7. Further, the lysosome-mediated degradation of internalized Tau was studied with LAMP-2A, a lysosome marker. The enhanced migratory ability in the presence of ALA could be beneficial for microglia to access the target and clear it. The increased migration of microglia was found to induce the microtubule-organizing center repolarization. The data indicate that the dietary fatty acids ALA could significantly enhance phagocytosis and intracellular degradation of internalized Tau. Our results suggest that microglia could be influenced to reduce extracellular Tau seed with dietary fatty acids.
