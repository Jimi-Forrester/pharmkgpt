24093080|t|Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease: Current Management and Experimental Therapeutics.
24093080|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major cause of morbidity in the elderly. AD affects aver 5 million persons in the United States, but because it increases in incidence in the elderly, and the "graying" population, AD is projected to increase in prevalence by many-fold over the coming decades. AD causes progressive mental impairment, resulting in the inability of persons to care for themselves. As a consequence, AD results in enormous costs to society due to both lost productivity, and required care. Thus, improved management and treatment is essential. In this review we will briefly review current understanding of the disease, including roles of beta-amyloid and tau proteins. We will then discuss current therapies in use, including the evidence for treatments with supplements, established drugs, and investigational therapeutic strategies, recently completed and ongoing.
