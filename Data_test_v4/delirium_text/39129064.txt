39129064|a|AIM: The aim of this study was to codesign a Family Members' Voice Reorientation Intervention (FAMVR) for delirium prevention and management in critically ill adult patients through collaborative process with previous patients, families, and clinical staff. BACKGROUND: Delirium is a common consequence of intensive care admission, and there is limited evidence to support family-led interventions to prevent or minimise delirium in intensive care. People with lived experience of intensive care are seldom involved in codesigning delirium prevention and management interventions despite the identified benefits of their involvement in delirium care. DESIGN: Codesign qualitative study. METHODS: The process of co-designing was undertaken using the four stages of the Double Diamond model. Participants included people with lived experience of the intensive care unit, family members, and intensive care clinicians. The codesign approach was utilised, and data were gathered from a series of focus groups and individual interviews. Data were digitally recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analysed using thematic analysis. FINDINGS: Of the 26 people who indicated their interest in participating, 12 (46%) completed the first and second stages, and nine (35%) completed the third and fourth stages of the Family Members' Voice Reorientation Intervention development. All participant groups were represented in the fourth stage: patients (n = 4), family members (n = 1), nurses (n = 2), and medical staff (n = 2). Four themes were identified: message content, wording, reactions, and tone, all of which informed the prototype of the intervention and its associated domains. CONCLUSION: A codesign approach was important for developing a delirium management intervention. This process enabled participants to provide their feedback in the context of their unique experiences, which in turn enhanced the authenticity and appropriateness of this unique intervention.
