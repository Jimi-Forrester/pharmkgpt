25903682|a|Assembly and deposition of amyloid ss-protein (Ass) is an invariable and fundamental event in the pathological process of Alzheimer's disease (AD). To decipher the AD pathogenesis and also to develop disease-modifying drugs for AD, clarification of the molecular mechanism underlying the Ass assembly into amyloid fibrils in the brain has been a crucial issue. GM1-ganglioside-bound Ass (GAss), with unique molecular characteristics such as having an altered conformation and the capability to accelerate Ass assembly, was discovered in an autopsied brain showing early pathological changes of AD in 1995. On the basis of these findings, it was hypothesized that GAss is an endogenous seed for amyloid fibril formation in the AD brain. A body of evidence that supports this GAss hypothesis has been growing over this past 20 years. In this article, seminal GAss studies that have been carried out to date, including recent ones using unique animal models, are reviewed.
