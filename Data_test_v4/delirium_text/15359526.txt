Individual interviews were conducted with four family caregivers. Results revealed ethnocultural and structural barriers that Chinese family caregivers experienced, including stigmatization of AD in the Chinese community, a lack of knowledge about AD, a lack of culturally and linguistically appropriate AD services, nega tive interactions with health-care providers, and difficulty with English. This study vides cultural knowledge and insights nurses who care for AD clients and their fam ilies. Overcoming barriers and working with Chinese American families and their community are needed to improve access and dementia services for Chinese American patients and their families.
