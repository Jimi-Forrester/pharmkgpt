36029882|a|BACKGROUND: Since COVID-19 outbreak, clinical experience on its management during the acute phase has rapidly grown, including potential effects on the psychopathological dimension. However, still few data are available regarding the impact on survivors' mental health over the long-term. METHODS: A sample of 1457 COVID-19 patients underwent a multidisciplinary follow-up protocol, approximately 3 months after hospital discharge, including a psychological evaluation. The primary outcomes were anxiety, depression, resilience, post-traumatic symptoms, and health-related quality of life. Furthermore, we examined the potential role of hospitalization and delay in the follow-up assessment on the increased burden of illness. RESULTS: Although a general high level of resilience emerged, suggesting most patients relied on their individual and interpersonal resources to face difficulties related to the pandemic, almost one third of the sample reported signs of psychological distress over time, especially post-traumatic symptoms, with anxiety being more represented than depression. Furthermore, hospitalization - regardless of the setting of care - and promptness in follow-up evaluation were found to play a protective role on patients' recovery and mental wellbeing. LIMITATIONS: Selection bias of patients exclusively admitted to the hospital; absence of a control group; psychological assessment relying on self-reported instruments. CONCLUSIONS: The current crisis demands resilience and adjustment resources, either in the acute and post-acute phase. Thus, the clinical effort should aim at relieving the traumatic impact of such condition through timely interventions. Further investigation may address potential predictors of developing a traumatic stress response, in order to identify and promptly treat at-risk subpopulations.
