32804280|t|Progression of sleep disturbances in Parkinson's disease: a 5-year longitudinal study.
32804280|a|BACKGROUND: Sleep disorders can occur in early Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the relationship between different sleep disturbances and their longitudinal evolution has not been fully explored. OBJECTIVE: To describe the frequency, coexistence, and longitudinal change in excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), insomnia, and probable REM sleep behavior disorder (pRBD) in early PD. METHODS: Data were obtained from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI). EDS, insomnia, and pRBD were defined using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, MDS-UPDRS Part I sub-item 1.7, and RBD screening questionnaire. RESULTS: 218 PD subjects and 102 controls completed 5 years of follow-up. At baseline, 69 (31.7%) PD subjects reported one type of sleep disturbance, 25 (11.5%) reported two types of sleep disturbances, and three (1.4%) reported all three types of sleep disturbances. At 5 years, the number of PD subjects reporting one, two, and three types of sleep disturbances was 85 (39.0%), 51 (23.4%), and 16 (7.3%), respectively. Only 41(18.8%) patients were taking sleep medications. The largest increase in frequency was seen in insomnia (44.5%), followed by EDS (32.1%) and pRBD (31.2%). Insomnia was the most common sleep problem at any time over the 5-year follow-up. The frequency of sleep disturbances in HCs remained stable. CONCLUSIONS: There is a progressive increase in the frequency of sleep disturbances in PD, with the number of subjects reporting multiple sleep disturbances increasing over time. Relatively a few patients reported multiple sleep disturbances, suggesting that they can have different pathogenesis. A large number of patients were not treated for their sleep disturbances.
