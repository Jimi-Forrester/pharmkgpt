37587888|t|The role of synthetic ligand of PPARalpha in regulation of transcription of genes related to mitochondria biogenesis and dynamic in an animal model of Alzheimer's disease.
37587888|a|Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors alpha (PPARalpha) are members of the nuclear receptors family and a very potent transcription factor engaged in the regulation of lipid and energy metabolism. Recent data suggest that PPARalpha could play an important role in the pathomechanism of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other neuropsychiatric disorders. This study focused on the effect of a synthetic ligand of PPARalpha, GW7647 on the transcription of genes encoding proteins of mitochondria biogenesis and dynamics in the brain of AD mice. The experiments were carried out using 12-month-old female FVB-Tg mice with the V717I mutation of amyloid precursor protein (APP + ) and mice without the transgene (APP - ). Moreover, APP + and APP - mice were treated for 14 days with GW7647 administered subcutaneously with a dose 5 mg/kg b.w. Brain cortex was used and qRT-PCR was performed. Our data indicated that GW7647 upregulated the expression of genes encoding proteins of mitochondria biogenesis in ADTg mice. GW7647 enhanced the level of mRNA of Ppargc1, Nrf2 and Tfam in APP + as compared to APP - mice treated with GW7647. Moreover, our studies demonstrated that GW7647 had no effect on genes that regulate mitochondria fission and fusion of ADTg mice as correlated to mice without the transgene. Our results indicate that the ligand of PPARalpha, GW7647 may exert a promising neuroprotective effect through the regulation of transcription of genes coding proteins of mitochondria biogenesis. These data suggest that activation of PPARalpha at an early stage of AD could be a helpful strategy for slowing the progression of neurodegeneration.
