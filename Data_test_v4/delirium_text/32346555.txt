32346555|t|Clinical database of the CYP-guides trial: An open data resource on psychiatric hospitalization for severe depression.
32346555|a|CYP-GUIDES (Cytochrome Psychotropic Genotyping Under Investigation for Decision Support ) is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of pharmacogenetic decision support in the psychotropic treatment of hospitalized patients with major depressive disorder or severe depression. Patients were treated according to their CYP2D6 functional status or empirically and compared for both their Length of Stay (LOS, primary outcome) at the hospital and Re-Admission Rate (RAR, secondary outcome) 30 days after discharge. The trial was conducted at the Institute of Living (Hartford Hospital, Hartford CT). CYP2D6 genotyping was implemented to infer the functional status of the CYP2D6 enzyme and classify it as sub-normal, normal or supra-normal. The electronic medical record (EMR) transmitted to the physician the indicated drug prescribing guidance. During the RCT, 1500 patients were recruited and 1459 genotyped for CYP2D6. A 1:2 randomization assigned 477 patients to standard therapy (Group S) and 982 to genetically-guided therapy (Group G). In Group S, standard empiric treatment was indicated for all patients. In Group G, medications primarily metabolized by the CYP2D6 enzyme were proscribed for patients with sub- or supra-normal CYP2D6 function. The clinical course, therapeutic guidance, and drug treatment for each patient are being published in this article and deposited in Mendeley Data. These data should be valuable to assess the impact of clinical decision support on utilization of psychiatric resources for treatment of severe depression requiring hospitalization.
