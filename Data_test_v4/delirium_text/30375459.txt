30375459|a|Motion perception of briefly displayed images has been reported to be abnormal in clinical populations afflicted with schizophrenia, major depression, autism, Alzheimer's disease and epilepsy. These abnormalities have been measured using CRT monitors connected to a computer. Given that the use of this experimental set-up in clinical environments can be difficult, we tested whether motion perception of briefly displayed images could also be measured using a tablet. For 13 participants, we found similar estimates of motion discrimination on a tablet and a CRT. This validates a tablet to measure motion perception of briefly displayed images.
