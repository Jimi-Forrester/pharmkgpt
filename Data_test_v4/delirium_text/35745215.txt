35745215|t|Dietary Glycemic Load and Plasma Amyloid-beta Biomarkers of Alzheimer's Disease.
35745215|a|Previous studies have highlighted links between a high-glycemic-load (GL) diet and Alzheimer's disease in apolipoprotein E epsilon4 (APOE4) carriers. However, the impact of high-GL diet on plasma amyloid-beta (Abeta), an Alzheimer's disease hallmark that can be detected decades before clinical symptomatology, is unknown. This study examined the association between plasma Abeta peptides (Abeta40, Abeta42 concentration and Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio) and GL. The influence of the GL of four meal types (breakfast, lunch, afternoon snack, and dinner) was also determined. From the prospective Three-City study, 377 participants with plasma Abeta measurements, and who completed the Food Frequency Questionnaire, were selected. The association between plasma Abeta and GL was tested using an adjusted linear regression model. Lunch GL was associated with a lower plasma Abeta42 concentration (beta = -2.2 [CI = -4.27, -0.12], p = 0.038) and lower Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio (beta = -0.009 [CI = -0.0172, -0.0007], p = 0.034) in the model adjusted for center, age, sex, education level, APOE4 status, energy intake, serum creatinine, total cholesterol, and Mediterranean-like diet. No significant association was found with the GL of the other meal types. These results suggest that dietary GL may independently modulate the plasma Abeta of the APOE4 status. The mechanism underlying diet, metabolic response, and Abeta peptide regulation must be elucidated.
