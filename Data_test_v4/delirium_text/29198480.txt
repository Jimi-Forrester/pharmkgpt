29198480|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that deeply affects patients, their family and society. Although scientists have made intense efforts in seeking the cure for AD, no drug available today is able to stop AD progression. In this context, compounds isolated from animal venom are potentially successful drugs for neuroprotection, since they selectively bind to nervous system targets. In this review, we presented different studies using peptides isolated from animal venom for the treatment of AD. This is a growing field that will be very helpful in understanding and even curing neurodegenerative diseases, especially AD.
