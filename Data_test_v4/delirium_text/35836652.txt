35836652|a|Magnesium alloys are an ideal material for biodegradable vascular stents, which can be completely absorbed in the human body, and have good biosafety and mechanical properties. However, the rapid corrosion rate and excessive localized corrosion, as well as challenges in the preparation and processing of microtubes for stents, are restricting the clinical application of magnesium-based vascular stents. In the present work we will give an overview of the recent progresses on biodegradable magnesium based vascular stents including magnesium alloy design, high-precision microtubes processing, stent shape optimisation and functional coating preparation. In particular, the Triune Principle in biodegradable magnesium alloy design is proposed based on our research experience, which requires three key aspects to be considered when designing new biodegradable magnesium alloys for vascular stents application, i.e. biocompatibility and biosafety, mechanical properties, and biodegradation. This review hopes to inspire the future studies on the design and development of biodegradable magnesium alloy-based vascular stents.
