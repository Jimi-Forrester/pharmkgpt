37576576|a|The benefits of remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) on multiple organs have been extensively investigated. According to existing research, suppressing the immune inflammatory response is an essential mechanism of RIC. Based on the extensive effects of RIC on cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, this article reviews the immune and inflammatory mechanisms of RIC and summarizes the effects of RIC on immunity and inflammation from three perspectives: (1) the mechanisms of the impact of RIC on inflammation and immunity; (2) evidence of the effects of RIC on immune and inflammatory processes in ischaemic stroke; and (3) possible future applications of this effect, especially in systemic infectious diseases such as sepsis and sepsis-associated encephalopathy. This review explores the possibility of using RIC as a treatment in more inflammation-related diseases, which will provide new ideas for the treatment of this kind of disease.
