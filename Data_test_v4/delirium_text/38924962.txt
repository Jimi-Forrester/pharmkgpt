38924962|t|Amyloid-beta oligomer-induced neurotoxicity by exosomal interactions between neuron and microglia.
38924962|a|A hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaque deposition in the brain, causing deficits in cognitive function. Amyloid-beta oligomers (AbetaOs), the soluble precursor peptides producing Abeta plaques, also produce neurotoxicity and microgliosis together with glycolytic reprogramming. Recently, monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1), a key glycolysis regulator, and its ancillary protein, CD147, are found to play an important role in the secretion of exosomes, 30-200 nm vesicles in size, which are considered as toxic molecule carriers in AD. However, the effect of low-concentration AbetaOs (1 nM) on microglia MCT1 and CD147 expression as well as 1 nM AbetaOs-treated microglia-derived exosomes on neuronal toxicity remain largely elusive. In this study, 1 nM AbetaOs induce significant axonopathy and microgliosis. Furthermore, 1 nM AbetaOs-treated neurons- or microglia-derived exosomes produce axonopathy through their autologous or heterologous uptake by neurons, supporting the role of exosomes as neurotoxicity mediators in AD. Interestingly, MCT1 and CD147 are enhanced in microglia by treatment with 1 nM AbetaOs or exosomes from 1 nM AbetaOs-treated- microglia or neurons, suggesting the implication of AbetaOs-induced enhanced MCT1 and CD147 in microglia with AD neuropathogenesis, which is consistent with the in-silico analysis of the single cell RNA sequencing data from microglia in mouse models of AD and AD patients.
