24991155|a|SUMMARY: Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is a rare, life-threatening adverse reaction to antipsychotic medication that typically includes high-fever, extrapyramidal symptoms, autonomic nervous system dysfunction and disturbances in consciousness. Though reported to be more common following use of the older, first generation antipsychotic medications, it can also occur in patients taking the newer, second generation antipsychotic medications. This report discusses the clinical presentation, possible etiology, pathogenesis and treatment of two cases of NMS that occurred in elderly patients after taking atypical antipsychotics. With the increasing use of atypical antipsychotic medication in elderly patients - who may be more susceptible to this adverse reaction - there is a need to increase clinical vigilance about this condition, particularly among internists and gerontologists who may be unfamiliar with this rare complication to antipsychotic medication.
