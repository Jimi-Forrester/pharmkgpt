36009226|a|Ilex paraguariensis (Herb mate) is a native plant from South America, widely consumed through the infusion of dried leaves. The presence of antioxidant properties in herb mate may be relevant and contribute to evaluating the effect of its compounds against oxidative stress, which could cause neurodegenerative diseases. Despite having health benefits, there are reports of the presence of heavy metals in extracts obtained from the infusion. One of these metals is iron (Fe), found in large amounts in herb mate. To reverse the cumulative effects of metals and Fe in the body, the use of Deferoxamine (Dfx) is indicated, being a potent chelator of Fe. In this work, we aimed to evaluate the antioxidant potential of the micro-encapsulated extract of I. paraguariensis (MEIP) supplemented with Dfx on zebrafish behavior and biochemical biomarkers. To evaluate the effect per se and the supplementation, four groups were established: the first group was the control (water); the second, fish treated with MEIP; the third group was formed of fish treated with Dfx; while the fourth group was treated with both MEIP and Dfx. When applied alone, Dfx presents an anxiogenic-like pattern on zebrafish (Danio rerio), while the MEIP shows an anxiolytic-like behavior. The antioxidant enzymes are re-modulated close to control when the MEIP + Dfx is applied. The cholinergic system shows an activation of the signaling, as well as the heme radical group formation, which is not affected by the Dfx-chelating effect. Thus, the supplementation of MEIP with Dfx is important to transform this extract into one that is safer and healthier for human consumption.
