33419365|t|Bisphenol A (BPA) Affects the Enteric Nervous System in the Porcine Stomach.
33419365|a|Bisphenol A (BPA) is widely utilized in plastic production process all over the world. Previous studies have shown that BPA, with its similarity to estrogen, may negatively affect living organisms. It is acknowledged that BPA distorts the activity of multiple internal systems, including the nervous, reproductive, urinary, and endocrine systems. BPA also affects the gastrointestinal tract and enteric nervous system (ENS), which is placed throughout the wall from the esophagus to the rectum. Contrary to the intestine, the influence of BPA on the ENS in the stomach is still little known. This study, performed using the double immunofluorescence method, has revealed that BPA affects the number of nervous structures in the porcine gastric wall immunoreactive to vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT, a marker of cholinergic neurons), substance P (SP), vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), galanin (GAL) and cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript peptide (CART). The character and severity of noted alterations depended on the part of the ENS, the BPA dose, and the type of neuronal substance. Administration of BPA resulted in an increase in the number of nervous structures containing SP, GAL, and/or CART, and a decrease in the number of cholinergic neurons in all parts of the gastric wall. The number of VIP-positive nervous structures increased in the enteric myenteric ganglia, along with the muscular and mucosal layers, whilst it decreased in the submucous ganglia. The exact mechanism of noted changes was not absolutely obvious, but they were probably related to the neuroprotective and adaptive processes constituting the response to the impact of BPA.
