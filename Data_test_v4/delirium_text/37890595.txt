37890595|a|BACKGROUND: Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) is a frequently observed underlying pathology of both Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VD), which is a common consequence of cerebral blood flow (CBF) dysregulation. Synaptic damage has been proven as a crucial causative factor for CCH-related cognitive impairment. This study aimed to investigate the neuroprotective impact of environmental enrichment (EE) intervention on CCH-induced synaptic destruction and the consequent cognitive impairment. Furthermore, the underlying mechanism of this neuroprotective effect was explored to provide new insights into therapeutic interventions for individuals suffering from AD or VD. METHODS: In this experiment, all rats were initially acclimatized to a standard environment (SE) for a period of one week. On the seventh day, rats underwent either bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (2VO) surgery or sham surgery (Sham) before being subjected to a four-week procedure of exposure to an EE, except for the control group. During the EE or SE procedure, intraperitoneal injection of chloroquine (CQ) into rats was performed once daily for four weeks. Following this, cognitive function was assessed using the Morris water maze (MWM) test. The synapse ultrastructure was subsequently observed using transmission electron microscopy. Expression levels of autophagy-related proteins (LC3, LAMP1, and P62) and synapse-related proteins (Synapsin I and PSD-95) were detected through Western blotting. Finally, immunofluorescence was used to examine the expression levels of Synapsin I and PSD-95 and the colocalization of LAMP-1 and LC3 in the hippocampus. RESULTS: After undergoing 2VO, rats exposed to SE exhibited cognitive impairment, autophagic dysfunction, and synapse damage. The synapse damage was evidenced by ultrastructural damage and degradation of synapse-related proteins. However, these effects were significantly mitigated by exposure to an EE intervention. Moreover, the intervention led to an improvement in autophagic dysfunction. CONCLUSION: The study found that EE had a positive impact on CCH-induced synaptic damage. Specifically, EE was found to increase synaptic plasticity-associated proteins and postsynaptic density thickness, while decreasing synaptic space. This multifaceted effect resulted in an amelioration of CCH-induced cognitive impairment. It was shown that this beneficial outcome was mediated via the activation of the autophagy-lysosomal pathway. Overall, the findings suggest that EE may have a therapeutic potential for cognitive impairments associated with CCH through autophagy-mediated synaptic improvement.
