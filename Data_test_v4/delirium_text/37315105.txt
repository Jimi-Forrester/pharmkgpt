37315105|a|BACKGROUND: Cognitive deficits can be present in the prodromal phase of Parkinson's disease (PD). Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) may contribute to identifying individuals with prodromal PD. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to examine whether SCD is more likely to be present in women with features suggestive of prodromal PD compared with women without these features. METHODS: The study population comprised 12,427 women from the Nurses' Health Study selected to investigate prodromal PD. Prodromal and risk markers of PD were assessed via self-administered questionnaires. We evaluated the association of hyposmia, constipation, and probable rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, three major features of prodromal PD, with SCD, adjusting for age, education, body mass index, physical activity, smoking, alcohol, caffeine intake, and depression. We also explored whether SCD was associated with the probability of prodromal PD and conducted additional analyses using data from neurocognitive tests. RESULTS: Women experiencing the three examined nonmotor features had the worst mean SCD score and the highest odds of poor subjective cognition (odds ratio [OR] = 1.78; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.29-2.47). This association persisted when women with objective cognitive deficits were excluded from analyses. SCD was also more common in women with a probability of prodromal PD >=0.80, particularly among those aged younger than 75 years (OR of poor subjective cognition = 6.57 [95% CI, 2.43-17.77]). These observations were consistent with the results from analyses using neurocognitive tests, where a worse global cognitive performance was observed among women with three features. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that self-perceived cognitive decline can be present during the prodromal phase of PD.   2023 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.
