35805336|a|The presence of heavy metals in the environment is increasing, which can be a danger to public health. Fish exposed to contaminated environments tend to have higher concentrations of some metals in their tissues. Monitoring these elements remains urgent as it is a matter of global concern. Canned sardines from the Brazilian market were analyzed for elements (Al, As, Ba, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Ni, Pb, Se, and Zn) of metals and metalloids, including some toxic, using inductively coupled plasma optical spectrometry (ICP OES) in two types of sardines (preserved in oil and tomato sauce) from five different brands. The results were compared to limit levels for consumption set by FAO/WHO. Moreover, we assessed the associated risk regarding the elemental intake of these elements through the samples, using the hazard quotient (HQ), hazard index (HI), and carcinogenic risk (CR). All samples had unfavorable HQ and HI, primarily due to arsenic content. In the same manner, CR for arsenic was above the proposed limit of 10-4, and cadmium and chromium, which were within the acceptable limit (10-6 to 10-4), require attention. These results show that chronic consumption of canned sardines sold in Brazil is unsafe, and quality surveillance is needed to ensure there is no risk to the population that ingests these products.
