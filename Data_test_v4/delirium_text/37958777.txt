37958777|t|The Assessment of the Efficacy of Imperatorin in Reducing Overactive Bladder Symptoms.
37958777|a|Overactive bladder syndrome (OAB) is a prevalent condition that affects the elderly population in particular and significantly impairs quality of life. Imperatorin, a naturally occurring furocoumarin, possesses diverse pharmacological properties that warrant consideration for drug development. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of imperatorin (IMP) to attenuate the cystometric and biochemical changes typically associated with retinyl acetate-induced overactive bladder (OAB) and to assess its viability as a pharmacological intervention for OAB patients. A total of 60 rats were divided into four groups: I-control, II-rats with rapamycin (RA)-induced OAB, III-rats administered IMP at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day, and IV-rats with RA-induced OAB treated with IMP. IMP or vehicle were injected intraperitoneally for 14 days. The cystometry and assessment of bladder blood flow were performed two days after the last dose of IMP. The rats were then placed in metabolic cages for 24 h. Urothelial thickness measurements and biochemical analyses were performed. Intravesical infusion of RA induced OAB. Notably, intraperitoneal administration of imperatorin had no discernible effect on urinary bladder function and micturition cycles in normal rats. IMP attenuated the severity of RA-induced OAB. RA induced increases in urothelial ATP, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), organic cation transporter 3 (OCT3), and vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT), as well as significant c-Fos expression in all micturition areas analyzed, which were attenuated by IMP. Furthermore, elevated levels of Rho kinase (ROCK1) and VAChT were observed in the detrusor, which were reversed by IMP in the context of RA-induced OAB in the urothelium, detrusor muscle, and urine. Imperatorin has a mitigating effect on detrusor overactivity. The mechanisms of action of IMP in the bladder appear to be diverse and complex. These findings suggest that IMP may provide protection against RA-induced OAB and could potentially develop into an innovative therapeutic strategy for the treatment of OAB.
