34521389|t|Multimorbidity and achievement of treatment goals among patients with type 2 diabetes: a primary care, real-world study.
34521389|a|BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes (T2D), with its prevalence and disability-causing nature, is a challenge for primary health care. Most patients with T2D are multimorbid, i.e. have one or more long-term diseases in addition to T2D. Multimorbidity may play a role in the achievement of T2D treatment targets, but is still not fully understood. The aims of the present cross-sectional, register-based study were to evaluate the prevalence and the most common patterns of multimorbidity among patients with T2D; and to study the potential associations between multimorbidity and treatment goal achievement, including measurements of glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and systolic blood pressure (sBP). METHODS: The study population consisted of 4545 primary care patients who received a T2D diagnosis between January 2011 and July 2019 in Rovaniemi Health Centre, Finland. Data on seven long-term concordant (T2D-related) diseases, eight long-term discordant (non-T2D-related) diseases, potential confounders (age, sex, body mass index, prescribed medication), and the outcomes studied were collected from patients' records. Logistic regression models with odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were assessed to determine the associations between multimorbidity and the achievement of treatment targets. RESULTS: Altogether, 93 % of the patients had one or more diseases in addition to T2D, i.e. were considered multimorbid. Furthermore, 21 % had only concordant disease(s) (Concordant subgroup), 8 % had only discordant disease(s) (Discordant subgroup) and 64 % had both (Concordant and discordant subgroup). As either single diseases or in combination with others, hypertension, musculoskeletal (MS) disease and hyperlipidaemia were the most prevalent multimorbidity patterns. Being multimorbid in general (OR 1.32, CI 1.01-1.70) and belonging to the Concordant (OR 1.45, CI 1.08-1.95) and Concordant and discordant (OR 1.31, CI 1.00-1.72) subgroups was associated with achievement of the HbA1c treatment target. Belonging to the Concordant and discordant subgroup was related to meeting the LDL treatment target (OR 1.31, CI 1.00-1.72). CONCLUSIONS: Multimorbidity, including cardiovascular risk and the musculoskeletal disease burden, was extremely prevalent among the T2D patients who consulted primary health care. Primary care clinicians should survey the possible co-existence of long-term diseases among T2D patients to help maintain adequate treatment of T2D.
