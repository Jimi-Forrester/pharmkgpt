34969380|t|Evaluating effect of metallic ions on aggregation behavior of beta-amyloid peptides by atomic force microscope and surface-enhanced Raman Scattering.
34969380|a|BACKGROUND: Excessive aggregation of beta-amyloid peptides (Abeta) is regarded as the hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. Exploring the underlying mechanism regulating Abeta aggregation remains challenging and investigating aggregation events of Abeta in the presence and absence of metallic ions at molecular level would be meaningful in elucidating the role of metal cations on interactions between Abeta molecules. In this study, chemical self-assembled monolayer (SAM) method was employed to fabricate monolayer of beta-amyloid peptides Abeta42 on gold substrate with a bolaamphiphile named 16-Mercaptohexadecanoic acid (MHA). Firstly, the samples of gold substrate (blank control), the MHA-modified substrate, and the Abeta42-modified substrate were detected by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to track the self-assembly process. Aggregation behaviors of Abeta42 before and after metallic ions (Zn2+, Ca2+, Al3+) treatment were monitored by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and the interaction between Abeta42 and metallic ions (Zn2+, Ca2+, Al3+) was investigated by surface-enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS). RESULTS: The XPS spectra of binding energy of gold substrate (blank control), the MHA-modified substrate, and the Abeta42-modified substrate are well fitted with the corresponding monolayer's composition, which indicates that Abeta42 monolayer is well formed. The recorded surface morphology of different experimental groups obtained by AFM showed markedly different nanostructures, indicating occurrence of aggregation events between Abeta42 molecules after adding metal ions to the solution. Compared to the control group, the presence of metallic ions resulted in the increased size of surface structures on the observed 3D topography. Besides, the intermolecular rupture force of Abeta42 increased with the addition of metallic ions. Further study by SERS showed that the Raman strength of Abeta42 changes significantly after the metal cation treatment. A considerable part of the amide bonds interacts with metal cations, leading to a structural change, which is characterized by the weakened beta-fold Raman peak. CONCLUSION: The AFM imaging results suggest that aggregation events occurred between Abeta42 molecules with the addition of metal cations. In addition, the results of force tests indicate that the presence of metallic ions could promote adhesion between Abeta42 molecules, which is likely to be the trigger for aggregation behavior of Abeta42. Furthermore, the effect of metallic cations on the conformational change of Abeta42 studied by SERS supported the results obtained by AFM. Taken together, the results showed that the presence of substoichiometric metal cations promotes aggregation behavior between Abeta42 molecules on the substrate at pH 7.4.
