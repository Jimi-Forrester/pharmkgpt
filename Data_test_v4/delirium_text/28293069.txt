28293069|t|Pharmacophore feature-based virtual screening for finding potent GSK-3 inhibitors using molecular docking and dynamics simulations.
28293069|a|Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) is a multitasking serine/threonine protein kinase, which is associated with the pathophysiology of several diseases such as diabetes, cancer, psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases. Tideglusib is a potent, selective, and irreversible GSK-3 inhibitor that has been investigated in phase II clinical trials for the treatment of progressive supranuclear palsy and Alzheimer's disease. In the present study, we performed pharmacophore feature-based virtual screening for identifying potent targetspecific GSK-3 inhibitors. We found 64 compounds that show better GSK-3 binding potentials compared with those of Tideglusib. We further validated the obtained binding potentials by performing 20-ns molecular dynamics simulations for GSK-3 complexed with Tideglusib and with the best compound found via virtual screening in this study. Several interesting molecular-level interactions were identified, including a covalent interaction with Cys199 residue at the entrance of the GSK-3 active site. These findings are expected to play a crucial role in the binding of target-specific GSK-3 inhibitors.
