34944457|t|The Pathophysiology and Treatment of Essential Tremor: The Role of Adenosine and Dopamine Receptors in Animal Models.
34944457|a|Essential tremor (ET) is one of the most common neurological disorders that often affects people in the prime of their lives, leading to a significant reduction in their quality of life, gradually making them unable to independently perform the simplest activities. Here we show that current ET pharmacotherapy often does not sufficiently alleviate disease symptoms and is completely ineffective in more than 30% of patients. At present, deep brain stimulation of the motor thalamus is the most effective ET treatment. However, like any brain surgery, it can cause many undesirable side effects; thus, it is only performed in patients with an advanced disease who are not responsive to drugs. Therefore, it seems extremely important to look for new strategies for treating ET. The purpose of this review is to summarize the current knowledge on the pathomechanism of ET based on studies in animal models of the disease, as well as to present and discuss the results of research available to date on various substances affecting dopamine (mainly D3) or adenosine A1 receptors, which, due to their ability to modulate harmaline-induced tremor, may provide the basis for the development of new potential therapies for ET in the future.
