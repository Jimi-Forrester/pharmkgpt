35144421|t|A systematic review and meta-analysis of the clinical efficacy of the intravenous injection of dexmedetomidine in ICU patients with hyperactive brain syndrome.
35144421|a|BACKGROUND: The incidence of hyperactive brain syndrome in patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) is very high. Compared with other sedative drugs, existing research shows that dexmedetomidine can significantly reduce the incidence of hyperactive brain syndrome. This study systematically analyzed the clinical efficacy of a dexmedetomidine intravenous injection in ICU patients with hyperactive brain syndrome. METHODS: The databases PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched from January 2000 to December 2020 to identify papers that studied the clinical efficacy of dexmedetomidine intravenous injection in ICU patients with hyperactive brain syndrome. The basic information and evaluation indexes in the literature were screened and extracted. Revman5.3 software was used for quality assessment and meta-analysis of the included studies, and forest maps were drawn. RESULTS: A total of 255 patients were included in 5 studies. The results of the meta-analysis showed that intravenous infusion of dexmedetomidine could reduce the incidence of restless delirium in patients [odds ratio (OR) =0.14; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.07 to 0.29; (Z test) Z=5.39, P<0.00001], total delirium after medication duration [mean difference (MD) =-15.50; 95% CI: -25.70 to -5.29; Z=2.98; P=0.003], and ICU hospitalization time (MD =-1.93; 95% CI: -3.57 to -0.29; Z=2.31; P=0.02). However, there was no significant difference in the incidence of adverse reactions (bradycardia and hypotension) in patients who were given an intravenous infusion of dexmedetomidine (OR =2.85; 95% CI: 0.21 to 38.74; Z=0.79; P=0.43). DISCUSSION: The incidence of restlessness delirium, the duration of total delirium after medication, and the length of ICU stay in patients treated with a dexmedetomidine intravenous injection were significantly lower than those in patients treated with haloperidol, indicating that a dexmedetomidine intravenous injection had clinical efficacy in ICU patients with hyperactive brain syndrome.
