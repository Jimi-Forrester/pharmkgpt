35296502|a|The development of vaccinations has been instrumental in the ongoing effort to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Although the benefits of vaccination are unquestionable, there have been reports of potentially rare life-threatening complications following vaccination including thrombocytopaenia, haemolytic anaemia, vasculitis and myocarditis. Haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), a rare but life-threatening inflammatory condition, has also been described postadenoviral vector COVID-19 vaccination but it has never been reported post-messenger RNA (mRNA) COVID-19 vaccination. We report two cases of HLH admitted to our hospital after administration of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. We also searched the vaccine adverse event reporting system and found 50 reports of suspected HLH following COVID-19 vaccination. Presently, we cannot define a causality between COVID-19 mRNA vaccination and HLH development. However, we hope the reporting of our two cases (and additional cases seen in the adverse event reporting database) will help us determine whether there is a potential relationship. Prompt recognition of this condition is of utmost importance to initiate life-saving therapy.
