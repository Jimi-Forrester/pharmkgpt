33136342|t|Altered mental status in "Guillain-Barre syndrome" -a noteworthy clinical clue.
33136342|a|Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) is widely regarded as a "pure" peripheral nervous system disorder. However, this simplistic interpretation belies the fact that central nervous system involvement, often manifesting as derangements in mental status can occur as a complication of the "pure" form of the disorder, as part of GBS variants, as well as in a number of mimic disorders. Despite being common in clinical practice, there is no guidance in the literature as to how to approach such scenarios. Herein, we detail our approach to these cases.
