34160330|t|T Cells: A Growing Universe of Roles in Neurodegenerative Diseases.
34160330|a|T cells play a central role in homeostasis and host defense against infectious diseases. T cell dysregulation can lead to recognizing self-antigens as foreign antigens, causing a detrimental autoimmune response. T cell involvement in multiple sclerosis (MS), long understood to be an autoimmune-mediated neurodegenerative disease, is well characterized. More recently, a role for T cells has also been identified for the neurodegenerative diseases Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Interestingly, several alleles and variants of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes have been classified as AD and PD risk genes. HLA codes for components of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I or class II, both of which are expressed by microglia, the innate immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS). Thus, both microglia and T cells may potentially interact in an antigen-dependent or independent fashion to shape the inflammatory cascade occurring in neurodegenerative diseases. Dissecting the antigen specificity of T cells may lead to new options for disease-modifying treatments in neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we review the current understanding of T cells in neurodegenerative diseases. We summarize the subsets of T cells, their phenotype and potential functions in animal models and in human studies of neurodegenerative diseases.
