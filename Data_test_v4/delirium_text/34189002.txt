34189002|t|Mollaret's Meningitis: A Rare Entity.
34189002|a|We report on a patient with Mollaret's meningitis to highlight the appropriate diagnostic criteria and benign prognosis without empiric antiviral therapy. An 83-year-old man with a history of aseptic meningitis of unknown etiology followed by full recovery presented with a two-day history of fevers, generalized weakness, and neurologic abnormalities. Cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) analysis demonstrated lymphocytic pleocytosis consistent with aseptic meningitis. Given his prior noninfectious aseptic meningitis and symptom-free interval, Mollaret's meningitis was suspected and empiric treatment for herpes simplex viruses (HSV) encephalitis with acyclovir was deferred. All CSF studies, including polymerase chain reactions for HSV-1 and HSV-2, returned negative with clinical improvement by the fourth day of admission. For patients suspected to have Mollaret's meningitis, lumbar puncture should be conducted promptly to facilitate diagnosis. Although several reports describe patients with CSF infection, the diagnosis of Mollaret's meningitis should be reserved for noninfectious cases. In such cases, empiric antiviral therapy for HSV encephalitis may be deferred and complete recovery is expected.
