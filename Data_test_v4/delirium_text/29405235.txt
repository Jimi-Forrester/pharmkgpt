29405235|a|BACKGROUND: Vincristine (VCR) is not a specific chemotherapeutic drug, responsible for cause several side effects. In this sense, many natural products have been studied to reduce this problem. Objetives: To examine the guarana neuroprotective effect in mice brain and cerebellum cells against vincristine (VCR) exposition. DESIGN: An in vitro study was performed using mice brain and cerebellum mice in monolayer culture. First, cells were exposed to VCR (0.009 microM for 24 hours and 0.0007 microM for 72 hours) to measure the cytotoxicity effect. Also, the cellular effect of hydroalcoholic extract of guarana (10; 30; 100 and 300 mug/mL) was evaluated in the same cells in 24 and 72 hours. After that, cells were exposed to VCR and guarana extract to evaluate the neuroprotective effect of guarana. MEASUREMENTS: Cell viability was analyzed by MTT, Free dsDNA and LHD Assays. Moreover, metabolism oxidative profile was evaluated by reactive oxygen species (ROS), lipoperoxidation (LPO) and catalase (CAT) levels through DCFH-DA, TBARS and Catalase Activity Assays, respectively. RESULTS: Our findings revealed that VCR caused neuronal cytotoxicity by reducing cell viability and increasing ROS and LPO levels. On the other hand, guarana did not cause cell damage in none of tested concentrations. In addition, guarana exhibited a notable protective effect on brain and cerebellum cells exposed to VCR by increasing cell viability, stimulating CAT activity, reducing levels of ROS and LPO. CONCLUSIONS: In this sense, guarana is a remarkable antioxidant fruit that could be a target in new therapies development to reduce VCR neurotoxicity.  .
