27887978|a|A 14-year-old girl presented with encephalopathy, delirium and ophthalmoplegia following a 3day history of high-grade fever. Brain MRI on day 6 of illness showed diffusion restricted ovoid lesion in the splenium of corpus callosum. Dengue virus encephalitis was diagnosed with positive PCR for dengue virus type-2 in both serum and cerebrospinal fluid. She made a complete recovery from day 10 of illness. Repeat brain MRI on day 12 of illness showed resolution of the splenial lesion. Serial diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) showed normal fractional anisotropy values on resolution of splenial lesion indicating that MERS was likely due to transient interstitial oedema with preservation of white matter tracts. This is the first reported case of MERS following dengue virus infection. It highlights the usefulness of performing serial DTI in understanding the underlying pathogenesis of MERS. Our case report widens the neurological manifestations associated with dengue infection and reiterates that patients with MERS should be managed supportively as the splenial white matter tracts are reversibly involved in MERS.
