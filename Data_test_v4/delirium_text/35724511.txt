35724511|t|The pharmacokinetic property and pharmacological activity of acteoside: A review.
35724511|a|Acteoside (AC), a phenylpropanoid glycoside isolated from many dicotyledonous plants, has been demonstrated various pharmacological activities, including anti-oxidation, anti-inflammation, anti-cancer, neuroprotection, cardiovascular protection, anti-diabetes, bone and cartilage protection, hepatoprotection, and anti-microorganism. However, AC has a poor bioavailability, which can be potentially improved by different strategies. The health-promoting characteristics of AC can be attributed to its mediation in many signaling pathways, such as MAPK, NF-kappaB, PI3K/AKT, TGFbeta/Smad, and AMPK/mTOR. Interestingly, docking simulation study indicates that AC can be an effective candidate to inhibit the activity of SARS-CoV2 main protease and protect against COVID-19. Many clinical trials for AC have been investigated, and it shows great potentials in drug development.
