24459374|t|Cognitive function in schizophrenia and its association with socio-demographics factors.
24459374|a|BACKGROUND: Schizophrenia is a chronic and debilitating psychiatric illness consisting primarily of positive and negative symptoms. However, cognitive deficits in various domains have been consistently replicated in patients with schizophrenia. Therefore, the present study was designed to assess cognitive impairment in schizophrenia and to correlate the same with sociodemographic factors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cognitive function in 100 patients with schizophrenia as per Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM IV-TR) criteria attending the psychiatry outpatient department (OPD) of Department of Psychiatry, SBKS MIRC was assessed using Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination Revised (ACER) rating scale and Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and sociodemographic details was obtained using semistructured proforma. Data was analyzed by Chi-square and t-test. RESULTS: About 70% patients of schizophrenia were found to have cognitive dysfunction for attention, concentration, memory, language, and executive function. Positive symptoms were associated with memory (P<0.001) and attention impairment (P<0.05). Patients with duration of illness >2 years and belonging to urban habitat showed more cognitive dysfunction. Male patients were associated with impairment in two domains of ACER: Language and memory. CONCLUSION: The study findings depict that persistent cognitive deficits are seen in patients with schizophrenia. Its correlation with sociodemographic factors showed that patients with >2 years of illness and belonging to urban habitat showed more cognitive dysfunction. Male patients were associated with language and memory impairment. Our study recommends that the neurocognitive impairment should be included in the DSM-V diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia.
