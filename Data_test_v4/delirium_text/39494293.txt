39494293|a|Irisin, a product of the post-translational processing of fibronectin type III domain-containing protein 5 (FNDC5), is a novel myokine which is upregulated during exercise. This hormone not only promotes the transformation of white adipose tissue into a brown-fat-like phenotype but also enhances energy expenditure and mitigates fat accumulation. Its role is crucial in the management of certain metabolic disorders such as diabetes and heart disease. Of note, the type of exercise performed significantly affects blood irisin levels, indicating the critical role of physical activity in regulating this hormone. This article aims to summarize the current scientific understanding of the role of irisin and the mechanisms through which it mediates cardiovascular protection through exercise. Moreover, this article aims to establish irisin as a potential target for preventing and treating cardiovascular diseases.
