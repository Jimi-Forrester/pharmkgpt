28789887|t|The impact of CT head scans on ED management and length of stay in bizarre behavior patients.
28789887|a|METHODS: A 5-year retrospective chart review was conducted at 3 EDs. Inclusion criteria were patients >=18years old triaged as "mental health - bizarre behavior" (deviation from normal cognitive behaviour with no obvious cause) with a CT head scan ordered in the ED. Exclusion criteria were focal neurologic deficits on exam, alternative medical etiology (i.e. delirium, trauma) and/or pre-existing CNS disease. Clinical, demographic and administrative data were extracted with 10% of charts independently reviewed by an Emergency Physician for inter-rater reliability. RESULTS: 266 cases met study criteria. Population demographics: 49% percent female, average age 51years old, 28% homeless, 58% arrived by police or ambulance. CT head results: 1 (0.4%) case with possible acute findings, 105 (39%) with incidental findings (i.e. cerebral atrophy) that did not impact clinical management. Average time to physician assessment was 1:48 (hour:min) (sd 1:11), time to CT completion was 5:05 (sd 7:28) and an average delay of 3:17 awaiting results. Subgroup analysis revealed a net increase in ED length of stay (ED LOS) of 5:02 from obtaining neuroimaging. 85% of patients were referred to a consultant, 92% were to psychiatry. CONCLUSIONS: CT head results prolonged ED LOS, delayed patient disposition and did not change the patient's clinical management. A prospective trial for ordering CT head scans in these patients is warranted.
