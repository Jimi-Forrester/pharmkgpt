32111255|a|BACKGROUND: Pregabalin is an anticonvulsive, analgesic and anxiolytic medication. The typical side effects include dizziness, somnolence and weight gain. Few studies or case reports have demonstrated psychiatric side effects resulting from its use. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a patient who suffered visual hallucinations and agitation associated with an increase in pregabalin dose, resolving completely after pregabalin discontinuation. CONCLUSIONS: Acute visual hallucinations should be considered in the clinical spectrum of very rare side effects of pregabalin use, especially at higher doses. Tapered discontinuation of the medication can improve and resolve symptoms.
