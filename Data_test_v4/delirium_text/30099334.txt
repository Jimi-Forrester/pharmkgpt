30099334|t|Generation of a human induced pluripotent stem cell line (LL008 1.4) from a familial Alzheimer's disease patient carrying a double KM670/671NL (Swedish) mutation in APP gene.
30099334|a|A double mutation (KM670/671NL) in amyloid precursor protein gene (APP) is causative for familial Alzheimer's disease and has been shown to increase the total Abeta burden. Here we report the generation and characterization of an iPSC line from a fAD patient carrying APP KM670/671NL. The generated iPSCs retained the mutation, expressed pluripotency markers, showed a normal karyotype and differentiated into all three germ layers. This iPSC line can be used, for example, in disease modeling and mechanistic studies. Resource table.
