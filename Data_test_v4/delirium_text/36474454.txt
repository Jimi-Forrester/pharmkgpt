36474454|a|PURPOSE: Dalfampridine (DFP) is used to improve motor functions in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Overdose of DFP can occur for a variety of reasons and can lead to a state of epilepsy. CASE REPORT: A 24-year-old woman with MS was admitted to hospital with severe sweating and delirium after attempting suicide by overdosing on DFP. At the time of hospitalization, she developed a tonic-clonic seizure that did not respond to immediate intravenous (IV) diazepam injection, followed by intravenous sodium valproate. Therefore, according to the hospital protocol of the neurology department, the patient was intubated and IV infusion of midazolam was started, Due to the persistence of seizures, sodium thiopental began and the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). In the ICU, she received an infusion of sodium thiopental and intravenous sodium valproate, monitored by a daily electroencephalogram (EEG). The patient was discharged after four days due to her stable medical condition. CONCLUSION: Epilepsy in case of overuse of DFP should be considered as a life-threatening side effect and timely treatment should be done to prevent damage to the nervous system.
