31247911|t|Polyphenolic Profiling, Quantitative Assessment and Biological Activities of Tunisian Native Mentha rotundifolia (L.) Huds.
31247911|a|Phenolic profiling of ten plant samples of Mentha rotundifolia (L.) Huds. collected from different bioclimatic areas of Tunisia, was for the first time carried out by using a fast ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC)-high resolution tandem mass spectrometry (HRMS/MS) method on a Q Exactive platform equipped with an electrospray ionization (ESI) source. An intraspecific, interpopulation variability was evidenced and a total of 17 polyphenolic metabolites were identified and quantified by using the UHPLC-HRESIMS/MS method, here validated for specificity, linearity, limit of detection, limit of quantitation, accuracy and precision. The quantitative method resulted sensitive at the nM level and reliable for rapid polyphenol quantification in vegetal matrices. The metabolomic study allowed us to identify a new compound, named salvianolic acid W, which was isolated and characterized mainly by NMR and MS analysis. A statistical correlation of the phenolic composition with antioxidant and anti-acetylcholinesterase activities was provided.
