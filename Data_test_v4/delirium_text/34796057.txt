34796057|t|Papulosquamous Disorders and Pregnancy.
34796057|a|Pregnancy can influence the course of a number of dermatologic disorders. Interestingly, these disorders can also influence pregnancy outcomes negatively, due to a variety of underlying pathogenic mechanisms. These outcomes may range from low fetal birth weight, preterm birth, and miscarriages to perineal lacerations complicating deliveries. Our review highlights the impact that papulosquamous disorders may have on pregnancy and their course throughout pregnancy. We chose papulosquamous disorders due to their relatively high prevalence worldwide compared to other dermatologic disorders. This review also sheds light on any gaps in the literature relevant to this topic that should be addressed.
