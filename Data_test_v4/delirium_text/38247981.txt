38247981|t|Influence of Potentially Inappropriate Medication Use on Older Australians' Admission to Emergency Department Short Stay.
38247981|a|Older people in the emergency department (ED) often pose complex medical challenges, with a significant prevalence of polypharmacy and potentially inappropriate medicines (PIMs) in Australia. A retrospective analysis of 200 consecutive patients aged over 65 years admitted to the emergency short stay unit (ESSU) aimed to identify polypharmacy (five or more regular medications), assess PIM prevalence, and explore the link between pre-admission PIMs and ESSU admissions. STOPP/START version 2 criteria were used for the PIM assessment, with an expert panel categorizing associated risks. Polypharmacy was observed in 161 patients (80.5%), who were older (mean age 82 versus 76 years) and took more regular medications (median 9 versus 3). One hundred and eighty-five (92.5%) patients had at least one PIM, 81 patients (40.5%) had STOPP PIMs, and 177 patients (88.5%) had START omissions. Polypharmacy significantly correlated with STOPP PIM (OR 4.8; 95%CI: 1.90-12.1), and for each additional medication the adjusted odds of having a STOPP PIM increased by 1.20 (95%CI: 1.11-1.28). Nineteen admissions (9.5%) were attributed to one or more PIMs (total 21 PIMs). Of these PIMs, the expert panel rated eight (38%) as high risk, five (24%) as moderate risk, and eight (38%) as low risk for causing hospital admission. The most common PIMs were benzodiazepines, accounting for 14 cases (73.6%). Older ESSU-admitted patients commonly presented with polypharmacy and PIMs, potentially contributing to their admission.
