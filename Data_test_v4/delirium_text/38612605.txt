38612605|t|Nervonic Acid Synthesis Substrates as Essential Components in Profiled Lipid Supplementation for More Effective Central Nervous System Regeneration.
38612605|a|Central nervous system (CNS) damage leads to severe neurological dysfunction as a result of neuronal cell death and axonal degeneration. As, in the mature CNS, neurons have little ability to regenerate their axons and reconstruct neural loss, demyelination is one of the hallmarks of neurological disorders such as multiple sclerosis (MS). Unfortunately, remyelination, as a regenerative process, is often insufficient to prevent axonal loss and improve neurological deficits after demyelination. Currently, there are still no effective therapeutic tools to restore neurological function, but interestingly, emerging studies prove the beneficial effects of lipid supplementation in a wide variety of pathological processes in the human body. In the future, available lipids with a proven beneficial effect on CNS regeneration could be included in supportive therapy, but this topic still requires further studies. Based on our and others' research, we review the role of exogenous lipids, pointing to substrates that are crucial in the remyelination process but are omitted in available studies, justifying the properly profiled supply of lipids in the human diet as a supportive therapy during CNS regeneration.
