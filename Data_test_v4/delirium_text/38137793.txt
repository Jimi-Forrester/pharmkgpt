38137793|t|Relationship between Pharmacological Treatment Strategy and Cognitive Function in Geriatric Patients with Atrial Fibrillation.
38137793|a|Background and question: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia in the total population. The aim of this study is to determine how geriatric patients with AF are treated in terms of rhythm or rate control and whether a relationship between the type of treatment and Mini Mental Status (MMS) can be identified. METHODS: In this monocentric, prospective, observational study, data including chronic medication as well as demographic parameters were collected from all patients in a geriatric department between April 2021 and April 2022. A 12-lead ECG as well as the Mini Mental Status were recorded for all patients as part of the admission routine, and a 24 h ECG was performed in selected patients on the basis of clinical indication. RESULTS: At baseline, 715 out of 1914 patients (37.4%) had a known history of AF. Of these patients, 43 patients (6%) were on rhythm control therapy (RHY) and 672 (94%) were on rate control therapy (RATE). No difference in respect to MMS could be detected between RHY and RATE. However, linear regression analyses showed that age, HASBLED score, creatinine serum level, and an existing antiplatelet medication were associated with a negative influence on MMS, whereas oral anticoagulation (OAC) was associated with improved MMS, respectively (p < 0.05 for all). CONCLUSION: The vast majority of geriatric patients with AF are treated with a rate control strategy. Oral anticoagulation is associated with better results in MMS, whereas patients who are treated with antiplatelet medication show worse results in MMS instead.
