27462146|a|Decay of the temporoparietal cortex is associated with prodromal Alzheimer's disease (AD). Additionally, shrinkage of the temporoparietal cerebral area has been connected with an increase in alpha3/alpha2 electroencephalogram (EEG) power ratio in prodromal AD. Furthermore, a lower regional blood perfusion has been exhibited in patients with a higher alpha3/alpha2 proportion when contrasted with low alpha3/alpha2 proportion. Furthermore, a lower regional blood perfusion and reduced hippocampal volume has been exhibited in patients with higher alpha3/alpha2 when contrasted with lower alpha3/alpha2 EEG power ratio. Neuropsychological evaluation, EEG recording, and magnetic resonance imaging were conducted in 74 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Estimation of cortical thickness and alpha3/alpha2 frequency power ratio was conducted for each patient. A subgroup of 27 patients also underwent single-photon emission computed tomography evaluation. In view of alpha3/alpha2 power ratio, the patients were divided into three groups. The connections among cortical decay, cerebral perfusion, and memory loss were evaluated by Pearson's r coefficient. Results demonstrated that higher alpha3/alpha2 frequency power ratio group was identified with brain shrinkage and cutdown perfusion inside the temporoparietal projections. In addition, decay and cutdown perfusion rate were connected with memory shortfalls in patients with MCI. MCI subgroup with higher alpha3/alpha2 EEG power ratio are at a greater risk to develop AD dementia.
