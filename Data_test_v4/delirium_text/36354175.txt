36354175|t|Single-Cell Transcriptomics Reveals Longevity Immune Remodeling Features Shared by Centenarians and Their Offspring.
36354175|a|Centenarians, who show mild infections and low incidence of tumors, are the optimal model to investigate healthy aging. However, longevity related immune characteristics has not been fully revealed largely due to lack of appropriate controls. In this study, single-cell transcriptomic analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) derived from seven centenarians (CEN), six centenarians' offspring (CO), and nine offspring spouses or neighbors (Control, age-matched to CO) are performed to investigate the shared immune features between CEN and CO. The results indicate that among all 12 T cell clusters, the cytotoxic-phenotype-clusters (CPC) and the naive-phenotype-clusters (NPC) significantly change between CEN and ontrol. Compared to Control, both CEN and CO are characterized by depleted NPC and increased CPC, which is dominated by CD8+ T cells. Furthermore, CPC from CEN and CO share enhanced signaling pathways and transcriptional factors associated with immune response, and possesse similar T-cell-receptor features, such as high clonal expansion. Interestingly, rather than a significant increase in GZMK+ CD8 cells during aging, centenarians show accumulation of GZMB+ and CMC1+ CD8 T cells. Collectively, this study unveils an immune remodeling pattern reflected by both quantitative increase and functional reinforcement of cytotoxic T cells which are essential for healthy aging.
