36334013|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Propofol is the most commonly used sedative in gastrointestinal endoscopic procedures, but is associated with cardiorespiratory suppression, particularly in elderly patients. Remimazolam is a new short-acting GABA(A) receptor agonist with minimal impact on cardiorespiratory suppression, and may be a viable alternative in elderly patients undergoing endoscopic procedures. METHODS: This multicenter, randomized controlled trial was conducted between September 2020 and September 2021. Elderly patients (65-85 years of age) scheduled to undergo upper gastrointestinal endoscopy were randomized in 1:1 ratio to receive remimazolam tosilate (300 mg/h) or propofol (3 g/h) in addition to 50-mug fentanyl, until the Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation Scale (MOAA/S) reached <=1. MOAA/S was maintained at 0 or 1 throughout the procedure using 2.5 mg remimazolam or 0.5 mg/kg propofol boluses in the two groups, respectively. The primary outcome was the rate of hypotension (defined as systolic blood pressure at <=90 mmHg or > 30% decline vs. the baseline). Bradycardia was defined as heart rate <=50 per minute; respiratory depression was defined as respiratory rate <8 per minute and/or SpO2  < 90%. RESULTS: A total of 400 patients (161 men and 239 women; 70.4 +- 4.6 years of age) were enrolled (200 patients per group). Average body mass index was 22.2 +- 2.4 kg/m2 . The rate of hypotension was 36.5% in the remimazolam group and 69.6% in the propofol group (p < 0.001). The remimazolam group also had a lower rate of bradycardia (1.5% vs. 8.5%, p < 0.001), respiratory depression (4.5% vs. 10.0%, p < 0.05) and pain at the injection site (0% vs. 12.0%, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Remimazolam was associated with a lower rate of hypotension in elderly patients undergoing upper gastrointestinal endoscopy under deep sedation/anaesthesia than propofol.
