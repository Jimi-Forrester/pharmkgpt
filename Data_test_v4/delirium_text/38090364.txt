38090364|t|Biomembrane-Derived Nanoparticles in Alzheimer's Disease Therapy: A Comprehensive Review of Synthetic Lipid Nanoparticles and Natural Cell-Derived Vesicles.
38090364|a|Current therapies for Alzheimer's disease used in the clinic predominantly focus on reducing symptoms with limited capability to control disease progression; thus, novel drugs are urgently needed. While nanoparticles (liposomes, high-density lipoprotein-based nanoparticles) constructed with synthetic biomembranes have shown great potential in AD therapy due to their excellent biocompatibility, multifunctionality and ability to penetrate the BBB, nanoparticles derived from natural biomembranes (extracellular vesicles, cell membrane-based nanoparticles) display inherent biocompatibility, stability, homing ability and ability to penetrate the BBB, which may present a safer and more effective treatment for AD. In this paper, we reviewed the synthetic and natural biomembrane-derived nanoparticles that are used in AD therapy. The challenges associated with the clinical translation of biomembrane-derived nanoparticles and future perspectives are also discussed.
