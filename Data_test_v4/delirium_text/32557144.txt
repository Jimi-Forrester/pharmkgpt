32557144|a|Hyperphosphorylated tau is the main component of neurofibrillary tangles and involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Increasing evidences suggest close associations between Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) and AD, but the relationship between P. gingivalis and tau hyperphosphorylation is still unclear. In this study, we investigated whether peripheral infection with P. gingivalis caused tau hyperphosphorylation by using wild Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats and HT-22 cells. The rats were injected with P. gingivalis suspension or phosphate-buffered saline 3 times per week. After 4 weeks or 12 weeks, the rats were sacrificed for analyzing systemic inflammation, neuroinflammation, and tau hyperphosphorylation. The results showed that the severity of phosphorylated tau at the AD-related sites Thr181 and Thr231 and the number of activated astrocytes were notably greater in the hippocampus of rats with P. gingivalis injection. And the levels of the inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1beta and IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in serum and hippocampus were also increased in the rats with P. gingivalis injection. In addition, the activity of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) was significantly inhibited in the hippocampus of rats with P. gingivalis injection. In vitro, IL-1beta induced tau hyperphosphorylation by inhibiting the activity of PP2A in HT-22 cells and application of the PP2A promoter efficiently attenuated IL-1beta-induced tau hyperphosphorylation in HT-22 cells. These results indicated that P. gingivalis could induce tau hyperphosphorylation via, in part, attenuating the activity of PP2A through triggering systemic inflammation and neuroinflammation in wild-type SD rats.
