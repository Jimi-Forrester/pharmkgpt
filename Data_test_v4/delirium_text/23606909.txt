23606909|a|Understanding the etiopathological processes of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in the preclinical and early clinical stages will be important in developing new therapeutic targets and biomarkers. There is growing consensus that nonamyloid targets will be necessary to reverse or slow AD progression. Lipidomic, metabolomic and targeted approaches have identified pathways and products of sphingolipid metabolism that are altered early in the course of AD and contribute to the neuropathological alterations associated with AD, including amyloid-beta production, tau formation and neurodegeneration. In this article, we briefly review the current literature on the role of sphingolipids in the underlying pathophysiology of AD, and then discuss the current state of translating these findings to clinical populations and the potential utility of plasma sphingolipids as diagnostic and/or prognostic indicators of AD.
