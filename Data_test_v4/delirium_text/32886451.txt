32886451|a|INTRODUCTION: Apolipoprotein E (APOE) interacts with Alzheimer's disease pathology to promote disease progression. We investigated the moderating effect of APOE on independent associations of amyloid and tau positron emission tomography (PET) with cognition. METHODS: For 297 nondemented older adults from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, regression equations modeled associations between cognition and (1) cortical amyloid beta (Abeta) PET levels adjusting for tau and (2) medial temporal lobe (MTL) tau PET levels adjusting for Abeta, including interactions with APOE epsilon4-carrier status. RESULTS: Adjusting for tau PET, Abeta was not associated with cognition and did not interact with APOE. In contrast, adjusting for Abeta PET, MTL tau was associated with all cognitive domains. Further, there was a stronger moderating effect of APOE on MTL tau and memory associations in epsilon4-carriers, even among Abeta-negative individuals. DISCUSSION: Findings suggest that APOE may interact with tau independently of Abeta and that elevated MTL tau confers negative cognitive consequences in Abeta-negative epsilon4 carriers.
