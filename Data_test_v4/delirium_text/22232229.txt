22232229|a|We developed a rapid method for estimating the amyloid beta (Abeta)-conformation state related with Alzheimer's disease. We prepared gold nanoparticle (AuNP)-Abeta antibody conjugates treated with bovine serum albumin to stabilize their dispersibility in a buffer. The prepared AuNPs were precipitated in the presence of Abeta aggregates, such as oligomers and fibrils. Abeta monomers did not precipitate AuNPs. The formation of AuNP precipitates by Abeta aggregates could be confirmed by the naked eye within 1 h.
