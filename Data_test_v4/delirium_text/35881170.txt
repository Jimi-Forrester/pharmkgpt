35881170|t|Pharmacotherapy of Alzheimer's disease: an overview of systematic reviews.
35881170|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease and the most common cause of dementia. In this umbrella systematic review (SR), we summarized the efficacy of different pharmacological interventions in improving cognitive function in patients with AD. METHODS: A systematic search was performed through the PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Cochrane databases for SRs of studies assessing the efficacy of pharmacological interventions versus placebo in improving cognitive function in AD or mild cognitive impairment due to AD. The risk of bias (RoB) was assessed using the Risk of Bias in SRs (ROBIS) tool. RESULTS: Out of 1748 articles found through the database survey, 33 SR articles were included. These studies assessed effects of immunotherapy, cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs), memantine, statins, lithium, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), antidiabetic agents, Cerebrolysin, RAS-targeting antihypertensive drugs (ARBs and ACEIs), psychostimulants, glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) inhibitors, melatonin, and herbal medications on cognitive function in AD patients. There was no notable overall RoB in 18 studies (54.5%), the RoB in 14 studies (42.4%) was high, and in one study (3.0%) it was unclear. CONCLUSIONS: The use of ChEIs, including rivastigmine, galantamine, and donepezil, as well as memantine has demonstrated a positive impact on improving cognitive outcomes of AD patients, but no considerable effects were found for immunotherapies. Melatonin, statins, antihypertensive drugs, antidiabetic agents, Cerebrolysin, psychostimulants, and some herbal drugs such as Danggui-Shaoyao-San and Ginkgo biloba seem to be effective in improving cognitive function of AD patients, but the evidence in this regard is limited.
