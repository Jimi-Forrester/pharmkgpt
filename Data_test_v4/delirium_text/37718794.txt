37718794|a|BACKGROUND: Cognitive impairment is common in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Previous studies indicated that intermittent hypoxia, sleep fragmentation, and depressive symptoms were associated with cognitive impairment in OSA patients. OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to investigate whether sleep characteristics and depressive symptoms affected cognitive abilities mediated by Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers and complement proteins in OSA patients without dementia. METHODS: A total of 317 subjects without dementia who had undergone polysomnography, cognitive and neuropsychological evaluations, were recruited. Neuronal-derived exosomes (NDEs) levels for amyloid-beta (Abeta), total tau (T-tau), and tau phosphorylated 62 at threonine 181 (P-T181-tau) and astrocyte-derived exosomes (ADEs) levels for complement proteins were measured. Mediation analysis were performed to explore the mediation effects of AD biomarkers (Abeta42, T-tau, P-T181-tau) and complement proteins (C3b and C5b-9) on cognition. RESULTS: The findings revealed that the association between sleep fragmentation and cognition was mediated by Abeta42 (the percentage varied from 18.25% to 30.6%), P-T181-tau (the percentage varied from 24.36% to 32.3%), and C5b-9 (the percentage varied from 30.88% to 60.7%). The influence of depressive symptoms on cognition was only mediated via C3b (the percentage varied from 24.1% to 36.6%). CONCLUSIONS: In OSA patients without dementia, Abeta42 and P-T181-tau levels in NDEs, and C5b-9 levels in ADEs mediated the impact of sleep fragmentation on cognitive impairment, and C3b levels in ADEs mediated the impact of depressive symptoms on cognitive impairment.
