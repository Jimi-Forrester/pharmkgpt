37698780|t|SIRT2 Inhibition Rescues Neurodegenerative Pathology but Increases Systemic Inflammation in a Transgenic Mouse Model of Alzheimer's Disease.
37698780|a|Sirtuin 2 (SIRT2) has been proposed to have a central role on aging, inflammation, cancer and neurodegenerative diseases; however, its specific function remains controversial. Recent studies propose SIRT2 pharmacological inhibition as a therapeutic strategy for several neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Surprisingly, none of these published studies regarding the potential interest of SIRT2 inhibition has assessed the peripheral adverse side consequences of this treatment. In this study, we demonstrate that the specific SIRT2 inhibitor, the compound 33i, does not exhibit genotoxic or mutagenic properties. Moreover, pharmacological treatment with 33i, improved cognitive dysfunction and long-term potentiation, reducing amyloid pathology and neuroinflammation in the APP/PS1 AD mouse model. However, this treatment increased peripheral levels of the inflammatory cytokines IL-1beta, TNF, IL-6 and MCP-1. Accordingly, peripheral SIRT2 inhibition with the blood brain barrier impermeable compound AGK-2, worsened the cognitive capacities and increased systemic inflammation. The analysis of human samples revealed that SIRT2 is increased in the brain but not in the serum of AD patients. These results suggest that, although SIRT2 pharmacological inhibition may have beneficial consequences in neurodegenerative diseases, its pharmacological inhibition at the periphery would not be recommended and the systemic adverse side effects should be considered. This information is essential to maximize the therapeutic potential of SIRT2 inhibition not only for AD but also for other neurodegenerative diseases.
