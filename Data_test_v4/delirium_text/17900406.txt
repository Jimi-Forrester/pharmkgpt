17900406|a|Delirium is a common complication of critically ill patients and is often associated with metabolic disorders. One of the most frequent metabolic disorders in intensive care unit (ICU) patients is hyperglycaemia. The aim of this retrospective study of 196 adult ICU patients was to determine if there is an association between hyperactive delirium and blood glucose levels in ICU patients. Hyperactive delirium was diagnosed using the delirium detection score. Blood glucose levels were monitored by blood gas analysis every 4 h. Hyperactive delirium was detected in 55 (28%) patients. Delirious patients showed significantly higher blood glucose levels than non-delirious patients Higher overall complication rates, length of ventilation, ICU stay and mortality rates were seen in the delirium group. In a multivariate analysis, glucose level, alcohol abuse, APACHE II score, complication by hospital-acquired pneumonia and a diagnosis of polytrauma on-admission all significantly influenced the appearance of delirium.
