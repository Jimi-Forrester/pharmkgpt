33040141|a|BACKGROUND: Studies have provided some evidence that pain is a risk factor for postoperative delirium (POD). Therefore, we investigated the relationship between preoperative pain and POD after noncardiac surgery. METHODS: POD was assessed with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, and preoperative cognition was assessed with the Mini-Mental State Examination. Plasma C-reactive protein (CRP) was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay before surgery. Preoperative pain was classified by its duration before surgery as chronic pain (lasting more than 1 month), acute pain (lasting less than 1 month), or no pain (no obvious pain). Multiple linear regression was used to adjust for confounding. RESULTS: From October 15, 2018, through August 12, 2019, a total of 67 patients were randomized; 7 were excluded because they were discharged before the seventh postoperative day. The prevalence of POD was significantly higher in the acute pain group (13 of 20; 65%) than in the chronic pain group (5 of 20; 25%) or the no pain group (6 of 20; 30%) (P = 0.019), indicating that delirium is associated with preoperative acute pain. The plasma level of preoperative CRP was also higher in the acute pain group than in the other two groups (mean [interquartile range]: 10.7 [3.3, 29.3] vs 1 [0.5, 3.8]mg/l; P < 0.001), suggesting that elevated preoperative plasma levels of CRP were associated with delirium. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative acute pain was associated with POD, and increased plasma levels of CRP provide a marker. In addition, we found that illiteracy and advanced age were risk factors for POD.
