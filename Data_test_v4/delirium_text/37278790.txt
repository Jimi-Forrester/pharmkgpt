37278790|a|INTRODUCTION: A robust body of literature supports the use of fascia iliaca compartment blocks (FICB) for improving outcomes in hip fractures, especially in the geriatric population. Our objective in this project was to implement consistent pre-surgical, emergency department (ED) FICB for hip fracture patients and to address barriers to implementation. METHODS: With the support of a multidisciplinary team, including orthopedic surgery and anesthesia, a core team of emergency physicians developed and implemented a departmentwide FICB training and credentialing program. The goal was to have 80% of all emergency physicians credentialed to provide pre-surgical FICB to all hip fracture patients seen in the ED who met the criteria. Following implementation, we assessed approximately one year of data on hip fracture patients presenting to the ED. We evaluated whether or not they were eligible for FICB and, if so, whether or not they received it. RESULTS: Emergency physician education has resulted in 86% of clinicians credentialed to perform FICB. Of 486 patients presenting for hip fracture, 295 (61%) were considered eligible for a block. Of those eligible, (54%) consented and underwent a FICB in the ED. CONCLUSION: A collaborative, multidisciplinary effort is vital for success. The primary barrier to achieving a higher percentage of eligible patients receiving blocks was the deficit of emergency physicians initially credentialed. Continuing education is ongoing, including credentialing and early identification of patients eligible for the fascia iliaca compartment block.
