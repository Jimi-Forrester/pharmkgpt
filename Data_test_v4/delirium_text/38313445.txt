38313445|a|Objective: The aim was to explore the prevalence and influencing factors of depression in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Methods: This was a cross-sectional study of the clinical data of 179 PD patients for retrospective analysis. Using the self-rating depression scale (SDS) and the Hamilton depression scale-21 (HAMD-21), we evaluated the prevalence of depression and analyzed the factors influencing depression in PD. Results: The prevalence of depression in PD patients was 45.25%, and the degree of depression was mainly mild to moderate. Sleep status, daily use of levodopa, a high Hoehn and Yahr stage, a high unified Parkinson's disease rating scale (UPDRS) II score, and a high UPDRS III score were all risk factors for depression in PD patients. Conclusion: The prevalence of depression in PD patients is high, and the degree of depression is closely related to many factors, which should receive close attention in clinical work.
