36045147|a|The orchid Dendrobium officinale grows throughout southeast China and southeast Asian countries and is used to treat inflammation and diabetes in traditional Chinese medicine. Tie pi feng dou is a well-known traditional Chinese medicine made from the dried D. officinale stems. Processing alters the physicochemical properties of TPFD; however, it is unclear how processing affects the quality and medicinal value of this plant. Here, we analyzed and compared the chemical composition of fresh stems of D. officinale and TPFD and explored possible explanations for the enhanced medicinal efficacy of processed D. officinale stems using qualitative and quantitative methods. To identify the components of FSD and TPFD, we used ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography combined with mass spectrometry in negative and positive ion modes and interpreted the data using the Human Metabolome Database and multivariate statistical analysis. We detected 23,709 peaks and identified 2352 metabolites; 370 of these metabolites were differentially abundant between FSD and TPFD (245 more abundant in TPFD than in FSD, and 125 less abundant), including organooxygen compounds, prenol lipids, flavonoids, carboxylic acids and their derivatives, and fatty acyls. Of these, 43 chemical markers clearly distinguished between FSD and TPFD samples, as confirmed using orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis. A pharmacological activity analysis showed that, compared with FSD, TPFD had significantly higher levels of some metabolites with anti-inflammatory activity, consistent with its use to treat inflammation. In addition to revealing the basis of the medicinal efficacy of TPFD, this study supports the benefits of the traditional usage of D. officinale.
