38849714|a|OBJECTIVE: We aimed to explore the association combined nutritional status and activities of daily living disability with all-cause mortality of older adults with hip fracture in the first year after hospitalization. METHODS: This is a single-center retrospective cohort study in older adults with hip fracture patients. Clinical data and laboratory results were collected from electronic medical record system of our hospital (2014-2021). The endpoint of this study was all-cause mortality in the first year after hospitalization. RESULTS: A total of 303 older adults were enrolled and all-cause mortality was 21.8%. The study population was categorized by CONUT score. Patients in CONUT score 5-12 had a higher age, ASA status, CRP and creatinine level, more patients with history of fracture, pneumonia and delirium, meanwhile, lower BMI and ADL score, lower hemoglobin, lymphocyte, total protein, albumin, triglyceride, total cholesterol and one year survival than those in CONUT score 0-4 (all P < 0.05). Multivariable Cox analysis showed that BMI, ADL score and CONUT score were independent risk factors for all-cause mortality of hip fracture in older adults (HR (95% CI):2.808(1.638, 4.814), P < 0.001; 2.862(1.637, 5.003), P < 0.001; 2.322(1.236, 4.359), P = 0.009, respectively). More importantly, the combined index of CONUT and ADL score had the best predictive performance based on ROC curve (AUC 0.785, 95% CI: 0.734-0.830, P < 0.0001). Kaplan-Meier survival curves for all-cause mortality showed that patients with CONUT score increase and ADL score impairment had a higher mortality rate at 1 year compared to CONUT score decrease and ADL score well (Log Rank chi2 = 45.717, P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Combined CONUT and ADL score is associated with one-year mortality after hip fracture surgery for geriatric patients.
