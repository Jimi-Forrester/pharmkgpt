26596892|a|A disodium phosphonooxymethyl prodrug of the antitumor agent triptolide was prepared from the natural product in three steps (39% yield) and displayed excellent aqueous solubility at pH 7.4 (61 mg/mL) compared to the natural product (17 mug/mL). The estimated shelf life (t90) for hydrolysis of the prodrug at 4  C and pH 7.4 was found to be two years. In a mouse model of human colon adenocarcinoma (HT-29), the prodrug administered intraperitoneally was effective in reducing or eliminating xenograft tumors at dose levels as low as 0.3 mg/kg when given daily and at 0.9 mg/kg when given less frequently. When given via intraperitoneal and oral routes at daily doses of 0.6 and 0.9 mg/kg, the prodrug was also effective and well tolerated in a mouse model of human ovarian cancer (A2780).
