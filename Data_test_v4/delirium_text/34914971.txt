34914971|a|BACKGROUND AND AIM: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the leading causes of dependence and disability among the elderly worldwide. The traditional anti-Alzheimer medication, rivastigmine, one of the cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs), fails to achieve a definitive cure. We tested the hypothesis that naproxen administration to the rivastigmine-treated aluminum chloride (AlCl3) Alzheimer's rat model could provide an additive neuroprotective effect compared to rivastigmine alone. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The studied groups were control (Cont), AlCl3 treated (Al), rivastigmine treated (RIVA), naproxen treated (Napro), and combined rivastigmine and naproxen treated (RIVA + Napro). Rats' memory, spatial learning, and cognitive behavior were assessed followed by evaluation of hippocampal acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity. Hippocampal and cerebellar histopathology were thoroughly examined. Activated caspase-3 and the neuroepithelial stem cells marker; nestin expressions were immunohistochemically assayed. RESULTS: AD rats displayed significantly impaired memory and cognitive function, augmented hippocampal AChE activity; massive neurodegeneration associated with enhanced astrogliosis, apoptosis, and impaired neurogenesis. Except for the enhancement of neurogenesis and suppression of apoptosis, the combination therapy had no additional neuroprotective benefit over rivastigmine-only therapy. CONCLUSION: Naproxen's efficacy was established by its ability to function at the cellular level, improved neurogenesis, and decreased, apoptosis without having an additional mitigating impact on cognitive impairment in rivastigmine-treated AD rats.
