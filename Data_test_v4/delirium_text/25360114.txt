25360114|t|Improving CSF Biomarkers' Performance for Predicting Progression from Mild Cognitive Impairment to Alzheimer's Disease by Considering Different Confounding Factors: A Meta-Analysis.
25360114|a|BACKGROUND: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers' performance for predicting conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's disease (AD) is still suboptimal. OBJECTIVE: By considering several confounding factors we aimed to identify in which situations these CSF biomarkers can be useful. DATA SOURCES: A systematic review was conducted on MEDLINE, PreMedline, EMBASE, PsycInfo, CINAHL, Cochrane, and CRD (1990-2013). ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: (1) Prospective studies of CSF biomarkers' performance for predicting conversion from MCI to AD/dementia; (2) inclusion of Abeta42 and T-tau and/or p-tau. Several meta-analyses were performed. RESULTS: Abeta42/p-tau ratio had high capacity to predict conversion to AD in MCI patients younger than 70 years. The p-tau had high capacity to identify MCI cases converting to AD in <=24 months. CONCLUSIONS: Explaining how different confounding factors influence CSF biomarkers' predictive performance is mandatory to elaborate a definitive map of situations, where these CSF biomarkers are useful both in clinics and research.
