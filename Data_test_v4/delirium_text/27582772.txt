27582772|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship among serum vitamin D levels, physical performance impairment, and geriatric syndromes in elders with hypertension. METHODS: According to the concentration of vitamin D levels, a total of 143 elderly patients with hypertension were classified into vitamin D deficient group (vitamin D <= 20 ng/mL, n = 94) and vitamin D appropriate group (vitamin D > 20 ng/mL, n = 49). Geriatric syndromes and physical performance were assessed by using comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA). Correlation among vitamin D levels, geriatric syndromes and physical performance was analyzed. RESULTS: No statistical differences were found in various aspects of geriatric syndromes between the two groups (P > 0.05). While correlation analysis indicated that vitamin D levels had a positive association with ADL score (r = 0.235, P < 0.01) and a negative association with Morse fall scale score (r = -0.238, P < 0.01). Patients with deficient vitamin D level had longer time both in the Five Time Sit to Stand Test (5tSTS), (15.765 +- 5.593) and the four-meter walk test [7.440 (5.620, 9.200)], a weaker hand-grip in the grip strength test (28.049 +- 9.522), and a lower Tinetti performance-oriented mobility assessment (Tinetti POMA) [26 (22, 27)] and Balance subscale of the Tinetti performance-oriented mobility assessment (B-POMA) score [14 (12, 16)], compared with appropriate vitamin D level [(13.275 +- 3.692); 5.810 (4.728, 7.325)]; (31.989 +- 10.217); [26.5 (25, 28)]; [15 (14, 16), respectively, all P < 0.05]. Furthermore, results of logistic regression indicated that vitamin D was significantly associated with 5tSTS (OR = 1.2, 95% CI = 1.050-1.331, P < 0.01), Tinetti POMA (OR = 3.7, 95% CI:1.284-10.830, P < 0.05) and B-POMA (OR = 0.8, 95% CI:0.643-0.973, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In elderly hypertensive patients, serum vitamin D deficient level is associated with physical performance impairment. However, no statistical significance was found between vitamin D and geriatric syndromes. Further study is required to investigate possible mechanisms for the association between vitamin D and physical performance.
