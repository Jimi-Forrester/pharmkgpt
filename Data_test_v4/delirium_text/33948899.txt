33948899|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating brain disorder characterized by neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid plaques. Inhibiting Tau protein and amyloid-beta (Abeta) production or removing these molecules is considered potential therapeutic strategies for AD. Genipin is an aglycone and is isolated from the extract of Gardenia jasminoides Ellis fruit. In this study, the effect and molecular mechanisms of genipin on the inhibition of Tau aggregation and Abeta generation were investigated. The results showed that genipin bound to Tau and protected against heparin-induced Tau fibril formation. Moreover, genipin suppressed Tau phosphorylation probably by downregulating the expression of CDK5 and GSK-3beta, and activated mTOR-dependent autophagy via the SIRT1/LKB1/AMPK signaling pathway in Tau-overexpressing cells. In addition, genipin decreased Abeta production by inhibiting BACE1 expression through the PERK/eIF2alpha signaling pathway in N2a/SweAPP cells. These data indicated that genipin could effectively lead to a significant reduction of phosphorylated Tau level and Abeta generation in vitro, suggesting that genipin might be developed into an effective therapeutic complement or a potential nutraceutical for preventing AD.
