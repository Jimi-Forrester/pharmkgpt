37764752|t|Adipose Tissue Dynamics: Cellular and Lipid Turnover in Health and Disease.
37764752|a|The alarming increase in obesity and its related metabolic health complications, such as type 2 diabetes, has evolved into a global pandemic. Obesity is mainly characterized by excessive accumulation of adipose tissue, primarily due to an imbalance between energy intake and expenditure. Prolonged positive energy balance leads to the expansion of existing adipocytes (hypertrophy) and/or an increase in preadipocyte and adipocyte number (hyperplasia) to accommodate excess energy intake. However, obesity is not solely defined by increases in adipocyte size and number. The turnover of adipose tissue cells also plays a crucial role in the development and progression of obesity. Cell turnover encompasses the processes of cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis, which collectively regulate the overall cell population within adipose tissue. Lipid turnover represents another critical factor that influences how adipose tissue stores and releases energy. Our understanding of adipose tissue lipid turnover in humans remains limited due to the slow rate of turnover and methodological constraints. Nonetheless, disturbances in lipid metabolism are strongly associated with altered adipose tissue lipid turnover. In obesity, there is a decreased rate of triglyceride removal (lipolysis followed by oxidation), leading to the accumulation of triglycerides over time. This review provides a comprehensive summary of findings from both in vitro and in vivo methods used to study the turnover of adipose cells and lipids in metabolic health and disease. Understanding the mechanisms underlying cellular and lipid turnover in obesity is essential for developing strategies to mitigate the adverse effects of excess adiposity.
