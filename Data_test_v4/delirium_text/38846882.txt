38846882|t|Statin use in total joint arthroplasty: a systematic review.
38846882|a|Introduction: There has been increased interest in the use of Statins in total hip and knee arthroplasty (THA and TKA) patients to improve outcomes and reduce postoperative complications. This study was performed to systematically review the evidence on Statin use in total joint arthroplasty, specifically its benefits and complications. Methods: Adhering to the PRISMA guidelines, a systematic review of PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and the Cochrane database was performed to find studies reporting on the effects of Statin use on outcomes of THA and TKA. Two authors independently selected relevant papers to include. Results: A total of 18 papers were included in the final analysis. Most were retrospective studies, with heterogeneous patient selection and outcome measures. The evidence on the risks and benefits of Statin use on outcomes of total joint arthroplasty was very limited and heterogeneous. Studies were focusing on perioperative cardiac outcomes, clinical outcomes and complications, renal, pulmonary, and gastrointestinal outcomes. Due to the heterogeneity of reported data, a formal meta-analysis was not possible. Conclusions: There is some evidence in the literature suggesting that perioperative use of Statins, especially in Statin-naive patients, may reduce cardiac (e.g. atrial fibrillation) and noncardiac (e.g. delirium) complications, while not increasing the risk of muscle or liver toxicity. The authors also found low levels of evidence that Statin use may reduce the long-term risk for revision surgery and osteolysis.
