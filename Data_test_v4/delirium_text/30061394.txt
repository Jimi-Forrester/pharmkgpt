30061394|a|Cell-autonomous and cell-nonautonomous mechanisms of neurodegeneration appear to occur in the proteinopathies, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. However, how neuronal toxicity is generated from misfolding-prone proteins secreted by nonneuronal tissues and whether modulating protein aggregate levels at distal locales affects the degeneration of postmitotic neurons remains unknown. We generated and characterized animal models of the transthyretin (TTR) amyloidoses that faithfully recapitulate cell-nonautonomous neuronal proteotoxicity by expressing human TTR in the Caenorhabditis elegans muscle. We identified sensory neurons with affected morphological and behavioral nociception-sensing impairments. Nonnative TTR oligomer load and neurotoxicity increased following inhibition of TTR degradation in distal macrophage-like nonaffected cells. Moreover, reducing TTR levels by RNAi or by kinetically stabilizing natively folded TTR pharmacologically decreased TTR aggregate load and attenuated neuronal dysfunction. These findings reveal a critical role for in trans modulation of aggregation-prone degradation that directly affects postmitotic tissue degeneration observed in the proteinopathies.
