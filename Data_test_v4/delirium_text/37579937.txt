37579937|a|Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) are enzymes that serve a wide range of physiological functions including the hydrolysis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine and several other xenobiotics. The development of inhibitors for these enzymes has been the focus for the treatment of several conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease. Novel chemical entities are evaluated as potential inhibitors of AChE and BChE using enzyme kinetics. A common issue encountered in these studies is low aqueous solubility of the possible inhibitor. Additives such as cosolvents or detergents can be included in these studies improve the aqueous solubility. Typical cosolvents include acetonitrile or dimethyl sulfoxide while typical detergents include Polysorbate 20 (Tween 20) or 3-((3-cholamidopropyl) dimethylammonio)-1-propanesulfonate (CHAPS). When solubility is not improved, these molecules are often not evaluated further. To address this issue eleven cosolvents and six detergents that could facilitate aqueous solubility were evaluated to understand how they would affect cholinesterase enzymes using Ellman's assay. These studies show that propylene glycol, acetonitrile, methanol, Tween 20, Polysorbate 80 (Tween 80), polyoxyethylene 23 lauryl ether (Brij 35) and polyoxyethylene 10 oleoyl ether (Brij 96v) have the least inhibitory effects towards cholinesterase activity. It is concluded that these cosolvents and detergents should be considered as solubilizing agents for evaluation of potential cholinesterase inhibitors with low aqueous solubility.
