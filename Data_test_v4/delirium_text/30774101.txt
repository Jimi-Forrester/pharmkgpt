30774101|a|This case report presents an adult patient with decreased levels of consciousness and bizarre behavior. A silent delirium was first suspected however, symptoms did not improve and further examination revealed elevated ammonia levels. A hepatic cause and portosystemic shunting were excluded and eventually a diagnosis of ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency was made. After treatment with high carbohydrate intake, a low protein diet and supplementation with arginine and sodium benzoate, the patient recovered.
