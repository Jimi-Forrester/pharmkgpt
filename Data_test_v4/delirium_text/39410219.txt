One method to preserve these fatty acids is the addition of synthetic antioxidants. This study focuses on the determination of peroxide and MDA formation rates at temperatures of 25  C, 45  C, and 65  C. The oxidative stability of cold-pressed avocado oil was evaluated using pure astaxanthin, TBHQ, and H. pluvialis extract at concentrations of 100, 500, and 1000 ppm. Kinetic models and thermodynamic analysis were applied to determine the oxidation rate and compare the antioxidant effects of H. pluvialis extract with astaxanthin and TBHQ. The Arrhenius model was used to estimate activation energy (Ea), enthalpy, entropy, and free energy. Avocado oil with 500 ppm of H. pluvialis extract showed antioxidant effects comparable to TBHQ and pure astaxanthin. The activation energy of plain avocado oil was 40.47 kJ mol-1, while with H. pluvialis extract, it was 54.35 kJ mol-1. These findings suggest that H. pluvialis extract offers effective antioxidant properties and could serve as a natural alternative to synthetic antioxidants in food applications, despite the limitations of unprotected astaxanthin.
