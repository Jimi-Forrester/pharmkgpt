8652068|a|The cholinergic antagonist scopolamine delays acquisition of eyeblink classical conditioning (EBCC) in rabbits and humans, but scopolamine-treated organisms eventually acquire conditioned responses (CRs). Patients with probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) and older adults with Down's syndrome (DS/AD) have disrupted cholinergic systems and perform EBCC very poorly. It was hypothesized that patients with probable AD and DS/AD, like scopolamine-injected organisms, would acquire CRs if given sufficient training. Twelve probable AD patients, 12 DS/AD patients, and 6 healthy elderly control individuals participated in 5 daily 90-trial sessions of EBCC. Fifty-eight percent of the probable AD, 92% of the DS/AD, and 100% of the control participants achieved learning criterion. Probable AD, DS/AD, and control participants had statistically significant increases in the percentage of CRs produced over 5 EBCC sessions. The neural substrate for EBCC was not eliminated in probable AD or DS/AD patients, although the learning mechanism was disrupted.
