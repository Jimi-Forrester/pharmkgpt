35268771|t|Efficient Heparin Recovery from Porcine Intestinal Mucosa Using Zeolite Imidazolate Framework-8.
35268771|a|Heparin is one of the most valuable active pharmaceutical ingredients, and it is generally isolated from porcine intestinal mucosa. Traditionally, different types of commercial resins are employed as an adsorbent for heparin uptake; however, using new, less expensive adsorbents has attracted more interest in the past few years to enhance the heparin recovery. Zeolite imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8), as a metal-organic framework (MOF) with a high surface area, porosity, and good stability at high temperatures, was selected to examine the heparin recovery. In this research, we demonstrate that ZIF-8 can recover up to ~70% (37 mg g-1) of heparin from porcine intestinal mucosa. A mechanistic study through kinetic and thermodynamic models on the adsorption revealed appropriate surface conditions for the adsorption of heparin molecules. The effect of different variables such as pH and temperature on heparin adsorption was also studied to optimize the recovery. This study is the first to investigate the usage of MOFs for heparin uptake.
