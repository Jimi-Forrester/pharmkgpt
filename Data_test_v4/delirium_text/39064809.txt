39064809|a|Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia globally. The pathogenesis is multifactorial and includes deposition of amyloid-beta in the central nervous system, presence of intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles and a decreased amount of synapses. It remains uncertain what causes the progression of the disease. Nowadays, it is suggested that the brain is connected to the gastrointestinal tract, especially the enteric nervous system and gut microbiome. Studies have found a positive association between AD and gastrointestinal diseases such as periodontitis, Helicobacter pylori infection, inflammatory bowel disease and microbiome disorders. H. pylori and its metabolites can enter the CNS via the oropharyngeal olfactory pathway and may predispose to the onset and progression of AD. Periodontitis may cause systemic inflammation of low severity with high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and neutrophils. Moreover, lipopolysaccharide from oral bacteria accompanies beta-amyloid in plaques that form in the brain. Increased intestinal permeability in IBS leads to neuronal inflammation from transference. Chronic inflammation may lead to beta-amyloid plaque formation in the intestinal tract that spreads to the brain via the vagus nerve. The microbiome plays an important role in many bodily functions, such as nutrient absorption and vitamin production, but it is also an important factor in the development of many diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. Both the quantity and diversity of the microbiome change significantly in patients with AD and even in people in the preclinical stage of the disease, when symptoms are not yet present. The microbiome influences the functioning of the central nervous system through, among other things, the microbiota-gut-brain axis. Given the involvement of the microbiome in the pathogenesis of AD, antibiotic therapy, probiotics and prebiotics, and faecal transplantation are being considered as possible therapeutic options.
