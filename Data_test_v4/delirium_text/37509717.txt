37509717|t|Current Understanding of Polyphenols to Enhance Bioavailability for Better Therapies.
37509717|a|In recent years, plant polyphenols have become a popular focus for the development of novel functional foods. Polyphenols, a class of bioactive compounds, including flavonoids, phenolic acids, and lignans, are commonly found in plant-based diets with a variety of biological actions, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer effects. Unfortunately, polyphenols are not widely used in nutraceuticals since many of the chemicals in polyphenols possess poor oral bioavailability. Thankfully, polyphenols can be encapsulated and transported using bio-based nanocarriers, thereby increasing their bioavailability. Polyphenols' limited water solubility and low bioavailability are limiting factors for their practical usage, but this issue can be resolved if suitable delivery vehicles are developed for encapsulating and delivering polyphenolic compounds. This paper provides an overview of the study of nanocarriers for the enhancement of polyphenol oral bioavailability, as well as a summary of the health advantages of polyphenols in the prevention and treatment of several diseases.
