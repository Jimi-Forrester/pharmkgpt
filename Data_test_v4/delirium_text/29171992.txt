29171992|a|BACKGROUND: Delirium has been associated with more rapid cognitive decline. However, it is unknown whether increased delirium severity is associated with a higher rate of long-term cognitive decline. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate delirium severity and the presence and rate of cognitive decline over 36 months following surgery. METHODS: We examined patients from the Successful Aging after Elective Surgery Study, who were age >=70 years undergoing major elective surgery (N = 560). Delirium severity was determined by the peak Confusion Assessment Method-Severity (CAM-S) score for each patient's hospitalization and grouped based on the sample distribution: scores of 0-2, 3-7, and 8-19. A neuropsychological composite, General Cognitive Performance (GCP), and proxy-reported Informant Questionnaire for Cognitive Decline (IQCODE) were used to examine cognitive outcomes following surgery at 0, 1, and 2 months, and then every 6 months for up to 3 years. RESULTS: No significant cognitive decline was observed for patients with peak CAM-S scores 0-2 (-0.17 GCP units/year, 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.35, 0.01). GCP scores decreased significantly in the group with peak CAM-S scores 3-7 (-0.30 GCP units/year, 95% CI -0.51, -0.09), and decreased almost three times faster in the highest delirium severity group (peak CAM-S scores 8-19; -0.82 GCP units/year, 95% CI -1.28, -0.37). A similar association was found for delirium severity and the proportion of patients who developed IQCODE impairment over time. CONCLUSION: Patients with the highest delirium severity experienced the greatest rate of cognitive decline, which exceeds the rate previously observed for patients with dementia, on serial neuropsychological testing administered over 3 years, with a dose-response relationship between delirium severity and long-term cognitive decline.
