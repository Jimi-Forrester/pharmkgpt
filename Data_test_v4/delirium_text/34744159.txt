34744159|a|BACKGROUND Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome is a serious insect-borne infectious disease caused by the Huaiyangshanbanyang virus. We conducted a retrospective study to identify risk factors for neurological complications caused by the virus. MATERIAL AND METHODS We included 121 patients who had severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome and were admitted to our hospital from 2013 to 2020. Patients' laboratory test results and clinical data were collected. Univariate and multivariate regression were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS Patients with neurological complications had higher mortality rates and longer hospital stays and disease duration than did patients without neurological complications. The neurological symptoms with the highest incidence rates were involuntary tremors (tongue and mandible), cognitive disorder, and limb tremors. Patients with neurological complications had a higher incidence of abnormal heart rhythms. Subcutaneous bleeding, pulmonary rales, percentage of neutrophils, increased lactate dehydrogenase and C-reactive protein levels, and decreased chloride ion concentration were closely related to the occurrence of neurological complications. The significant decrease in chloride ion concentration within 1 to 5 days of disease onset may be a risk factor for predicting the occurrence of neurological complications in patients with severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome. CONCLUSIONS Early monitoring of subcutaneous bleeding, pulmonary rales, electrocardiogram changes, and biochemical indicators in patients with severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome can predict the occurrence of neurological complications.
