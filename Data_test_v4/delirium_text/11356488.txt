11356488|t|Vaccine development for Alzheimer's disease: a shot of good news.
11356488|a|Studies in transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer's disease suggest the potential for vaccine development for this disease. Specifically, inoculation with Abeta peptide reduces Abeta plaque formation. However, this vaccination strategy has raised safety concerns. Recent studies have reduced these concerns by demonstrating that long-term Abeta vaccination in transgenic mice does not produce detrimental behavioral effects and in fact appears to protect against age-related functional decline in spatial memory tasks.
