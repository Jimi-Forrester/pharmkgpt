34642321|a|To investigate the mechanism of peripheral neuropathy in Parkinson's disease (PD), we prepared a PD mice model by long-term exposure of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) to mimic PD pathology in humans and the sciatic nerves were taken for further research. It turned out that phosphorylated alpha-synuclein (p-alpha-syn) was significantly deposited in Schwann cells (SCs) of sciatic nerves possibly contributing to degenerated myelin SCs and atrophied axons in MPTP group. Further analysis confirmed that toll-like receptors (TLRs) were implicated with PD peripheral neuropathy, in which TLR2 exhibits the predominant expression. Increased expression of inflammatory factors about TLR2/nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kappaB) pathway was noted in MPTP group compared to saline group, with proteins on other pathways showing no changes. Moreover, MPTP-challenged mice exhibited worse motor ability and damaged nerve conduction, implicating that p-alpha-syn neurotoxicity might be relevant to impairments of motor and sensory nerves. After the treatment of CU-CPT22, a TLR2 antagonist, p-alpha-syn accumulation, motor and sensory function were ameliorated in CU-CPT22 combined with MPTP group. Thus, we demonstrated that pathological p-alpha-syn might combine TLR2 to affect SCs activation, inflammatory response as well as motor and sensory function through TLR2/nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kappaB) signaling pathway. This study firstly demonstrates a novel mechanism of p-alpha-syn accumulated in SCs of peripheral nerves, which extends our understanding on SCs-mediated peripheral neuroinflammation related to TLR2/NF-kappaB signaling pathway and sheds light on potential new therapeutic avenues for PD.
