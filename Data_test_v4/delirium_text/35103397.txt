35103397|t|The comprehensive, customized, cost-effective approach (CCCAP) to prevention of dementia.
35103397|a|The Food and Drug Administration's controversial approval of aducanumab has sounded a wake-up call. Is the search of a silver bullet to stop Alzheimer's disease the only way to prevent dementia? The controversies and costs have opened minds to alternative approaches, the most promising being that we are already preventing some dementias in some high-income countries but do not know yet how. This article proposes one way. It requires that the approach be (1) comprehensive, taking into account all relevant environmental, socioeconomic, and individual risk and protective factors; (2) customized, because contributing factors vary by region and among individuals; and (3) cost effective, implemented in actionable units. Savings of scale could occur by preventing stroke, heart disease, and dementia together. They share the same risk factors and pose risks for each other. Brain health could be the unifying, motivating, and actionable key to health, productivity, and well-being.
