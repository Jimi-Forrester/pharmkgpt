38592304|a|Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) is upregulated in activated microglia and may be related to cognitive decline in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). There is conflicting evidence regarding the association of peripheral TREM2 mRNA expression/soluble TREM2 (the extracellular domain of TREM2) with cognitive function/neuroinflammation in patients with AD. Herein, we studied the TREM2 and TREM2alt mRNA expression and their association with the cognitive performance in subjects with mild dementia due to AD and healthy controls. In a subgroup of patients with AD, magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to measure the myo-inositol level in the posterior cingulate cortex, a surrogate marker for neuroinflammation. The results showed that increased TREM2 and TREM2alt mRNA expression is associated with AD pathogenesis at the mild dementia stage, thereby serving as a potential biomarker for early symptomatic stage of AD. TREM2 may exert protective effects on both cognition and central neuroinflammation.
