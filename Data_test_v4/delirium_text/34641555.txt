34641555|a|Folate is a vitamin beneficial for humans that plays an important role in metabolism, but it cannot be well supplemented by food; it is necessary to supplement it in other ways. Based on this consideration, a novel crystal form C of 6S-5-methyltetrahydrofolate calcium salt (MTHF CAC) was obtained. To explore the difference between MTHF CAC and the crystal form I of 6S-5-methyltetrahydrofolate calcium salt (MTHF CA) as well as an amorphous product of 6S-5-methyltetrahydrofolate glucosamine salt (MTHF GA), their stability and pharmacokinetic behaviours were compared. The results of high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with ultraviolet detection analysis indicated that MTHF CAC showed a better stability than MTHF CA and MTHF GA. After oral administration of MTHF CAC, MTHF CA, and MTHF GA to male rats, the MTHF concentrations were analysed using a validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, and the pharmacokinetic parameters were compared. The mean residence times (0-t) of MTHF CAC, MTHF CA, and MTHF GA were 3.7 +- 1.9 h, 1.0 +- 0.2 h (p < 0.01), and 1.5 +- 0.3 h (p < 0.05), respectively. The relative bioavailability of MTHF CAC was calculated to be 351% and 218% compared with MTHF CA and MTHF GA, respectively, which suggests that MTHF CAC can be better absorbed and utilized for a longer period of time.
