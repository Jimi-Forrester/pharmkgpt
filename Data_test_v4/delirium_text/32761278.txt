32761278|t|Bilateral lesions of the basal ganglia and thalami (central grey matter)-pictorial review.
32761278|a|The basal ganglia and thalami are paired deep grey matter structures with extensive metabolic activity that renders them susceptible to injury by various diseases. Most pathological processes lead to bilateral lesions, which may be symmetric or asymmetric, frequently showing characteristic patterns on imaging studies. In this comprehensive pictorial review, the most common and/or typical genetic, acquired metabolic/toxic, infectious, inflammatory, vascular and neoplastic pathologies affecting the central grey matter are subdivided according to the preferential location of the lesions: in the basal ganglia, in the thalami or both. The characteristic imaging findings are described with emphasis on the differential diagnosis and clinical context.
