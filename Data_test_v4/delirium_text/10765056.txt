10765056|a|In order to address an age-dependent alteration in the concentration of beta-amyloid polypeptides (Abetas) within the central nervous system and its probable predisposition to amyloidgenesis in Alzheimer's disease (AD), we measured two species of soluble Abetas, Abeta40 and Abeta42, in cerebrospinal fluids (CSF) from randomly selected Japanese control subjects at various ages (n = 33) and then compared these data with those of probable Japanese AD patients (n = 23). CSF concentrations of Abeta40 and Abeta42 peptides were age-dependent (ANOVA, Bonferroni's multiple comparison; p < 0.01 and p < 0.05, respectively) and were lower in the infant than in adults. From mid-20, the Abeta40 concentrations were decreasing while Abeta42 were rather stable. Abetas in CSF from AD patients (n = 23), whose epsilon4 allele frequency of the apolipoprotein E gene was higher than in controls (n = 83, p < 0.03), were not statistically different from those of age-matched controls (n = 13). A linear relationship was detected between the Abeta40 concentration and the Mini-Mental State Examination score (p < 0.05). The ratio of the Abeta42 to the Abeta40 level measured in the AD CSF samples was approximately 38% decreased compared to age-matched controls (p < 0. 05). These data suggest that the physiological metabolism of soluble Abetas in the brain is regulated in an age-dependent manner, and that the ratio of Abeta42 to Abeta40 level in the CSF would be a useful marker for monitoring progression of AD.
