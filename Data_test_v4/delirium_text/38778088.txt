We conducted a prospective cross-sectional study in the community to provide quantitative details of the pilot implementation of the antigen rapid diagnostic test (AgRDT) in Tanzania. This study was undertaken between March 2022 and September 2022. The pilot was implemented by distributing and offering test kits to people suspected of having COVID-19 in Dar es Salaam through community health workers. A total of 1039 participants consented to participate in the survey. All the participants reported having heard about the disease. The radio was the main source (93.2%) of information on COVID-19. With regard to prevention measures, approximately 930 (89.5%) of the respondents thought that COVID-19 could be prevented. Approximately 1035 (99.6%) participants reported that they were willing to have a COVID-19 AgRDT test and wait for 20 min for the results. With regard to the participants' opinions on the AgRDT device, the majority 907 (87.3%) felt comfortable with the test, and 1,029 (99.0%) were very likely to recommend the AgRDT test to their friends. The majority of participants 848 (83.1%) mentioned that they would be willing to pay for the test if it was not available for free. The results suggest overall good acceptance of the COVID-19 AgRDT test. It is evident that the use of trained community healthcare workers allows easy screening of all possible suspects and helps them receive early treatment.
