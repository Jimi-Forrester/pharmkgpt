22840309|t|Perioperative complications following total joint replacement.
22840309|a|Total joint arthroplasty is a safe and highly effective treatment for moderate to severe osteoarthritic symptoms and other causes of joint derangement in the elderly population. Significant improvements in pain, function, and quality of life are nearly universal, with a low rate of complications and adverse outcomes. Because of its success and cost-effectiveness, the rate of utilization of TJR is increasing, and all health care providers must be familiar with the potential complications and perioperative management of these patients. Elderly patients may be at a higher risk for postoperative medical complications; however, the majority of these complications are minor and many are avoidable with appropriate preoperative screening and careful postoperative management. As with all patients undergoing TJR, patients should be prophylactically treated for infection and thromboembolism and carefully followed for the development of these potential complications as well as fracture, hip dislocation, and neurovascular dysfunction. Postoperative delirium may be minimized and prophylactically treated in appropriate elderly patients to maximize recovery and promote safety.
