39344232|t|Alzheimer's Disease and Effects of ABCA7 Polymorphisms: A Review.
39344232|a|Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease and the main cause of dementia. Its etiology remains largely unclear, though genetic and environmental factors appear to confer susceptibility to AD development. This study assessed the role of ATP-binding Cassette A Subfamily 7 (ABCA7) genetic polymorphisms, as ongoing research suggests they have a role in the development of AD. We conducted a PubMed, Google Scholar, and Scopus search to identify and assess all AD studies examining ABCA7 variants in different populations and ethnicities. The last search was conducted on February 8, 2023. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied and only the studies that met the inclusion criteria were included in this review. Seventeen studies were finally included. According to the results, ABCA7 variants infer different risks for AD among populations with different ancestries. African American populations show a higher risk for AD, carrying the five novel variants rs115550680, rs142076058, rs10405305, rs3764647, and rs567222111. Asian populations also have an increased risk for AD, harboring three variants. ABCA7 genetic variability contributes to AD development and shows racial disparities. African American and Asian populations seem to be at greater risk of developing AD. These results may assist future research efforts for the early and accurate diagnosis of AD. Moreover, further exploration of the mechanisms of ABCA7 in the context of AD could identify potential therapeutic targets.
