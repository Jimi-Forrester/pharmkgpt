23188606|a|BACKGROUND: We aimed to assess early period psychiatric disorders following burn trauma. METHODS: The files of 1369 patients who had burn trauma were analyzed retrospectively. Forty-five patients with the diagnosis of psychiatric disorder were assessed based on the variables of age, gender, presence of chronic diseases, psychiatric disorders prior to burn trauma, cause of the burn, burn percentage, degree of burn, additional trauma, number of surgeries, duration of hospitalization, extremity amputation, intubation status, psychiatric symptoms, post-trauma psychiatric disorders, and mortality. RESULTS: Forty-five patients developed psychiatric disorder in the early period following burn trauma. Of the 45 patients, 7 (15.5%) were female and 38 (84.5%) were male. The mean age was 32+-14.3 years, burn percentage was 40.09+-20.69%, number of operations was 2.95+-1.75, and the total duration of hospitalization was 51.57+-38.62 days. welve (26.6%) patients had post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), 11 (24.4%) had delirium, 8 (17.7%) had anxiety disorder, 7 (15.5%) had depression, 1 (2.2%) had abstinence syndrome, 1 (2.2%) had schizoaffective disorder, 2 (4.4%) had PTSD and depression, 2 (4.4%) had PTSD and delirium, and 1 (2.2%) had PTSD and anxiety disorder. CONCLUSION: Burn is a trauma that can be treated with a multidisciplinary approach.
