32887355|t|Proteomic Characterization of the Olfactory Molecular Imbalance in Dementia with Lewy Bodies.
32887355|a|Olfactory dysfunction is one of the prodromal symptoms in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). However, the molecular pathogenesis associated with decreased smell function remains largely undeciphered. We generated quantitative proteome maps to detect molecular alterations in olfactory bulbs (OB) derived from DLB subjects compared to neurologically intact controls. A total of 3214 olfactory proteins were quantified, and 99 proteins showed significant alterations in DLB cases. Protein interaction networks disrupted in DLB indicated an imbalance in translation and the synaptic vesicle cycle. These alterations were accompanied by alterations in AKT/MAPK/SEK1/p38 MAPK signaling pathways that showed a distinct expression profile across the OB-olfactory tract (OT) axis. Taken together, our data partially reflect the missing links in the biochemical understanding of olfactory dysfunction in DLB.
