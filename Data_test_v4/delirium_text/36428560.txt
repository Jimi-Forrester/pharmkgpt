36428560|a|Acute kidney injury (AKI) is an inflammatory sequence. It can lead to distant organ injury, including damage to the central nervous system (CNS), mediated by increased circulating cytokines and other inflammatory mediators. It can also lead to increased blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability. However, the effect of AKI on the inflammatory response of the brain has not yet been investigated. Therefore, we observed the effect of AKI on BBB permeability, microglia and astrocyte activation, and neuronal toxicity in the brain. The striatum and ventral midbrain, known to control overall movement, secrete the neurotransmitter dopamine. The activation of microglia and astrocytes present in this area causes neuro-degenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). The activation of astrocytes and microglia in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex, which are responsible for important functions, including memory, learning, concentration, and language, can trigger nerve cell apoptosis. The activation of astrocytes and microglia at this site is also involved in the inflammatory response associated with the accumulation of beta-amyloid. In the situation of kidney ischemia reperfusion (IR)-induced AKI, activation of microglia and astrocytes were observed in the striatum, ventral midbrain, hippocampus, and cortex. However, neuronal cell death was not observed until 48 h.
