31827203|t|Change of Detrusor Contractility in Patients with and without Bladder Outlet Obstruction at Ten or More Years of follow-up.
31827203|a|To analyze the change of detrusor contractility by investigating urodynamic characteristics with long term follow-up. This study retrospectively reviewed 166 lower urinary tract symptoms patients without bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) and 63 patients with BOO who underwent repeated urodynamic studies at the first time and more than 10 years later. The urodynamic parameters, bladder contractility index (BCI), and BOO index (BOOI) were compared before and after. As time goes by, detrusor pressure at maximum flow rate (PdetQmax) significantly decreased and post-void residual (PVR) volume significantly increased in both men and women. Full sensation, urge sensation, voided volume, and BCI significantly decreased. We also compared men with and without BOO, PdetQmax, maximum flow rate (Qmax), voided volume, and BCI all significantly decreased in both groups without difference. PVR increased greater in men with BOO after >10 years significantly (p = 0.036). Women with detrusor overactivity (DO) under antimuscarinic showed no significant BCI change compared to patients without DO (p = 0.228). Detrusor contractility decreases in men and women after >10 years of follow-up. However, this finding suggests that patients with BOO or DO under adequate medical treatment, detrusor contractility is not aggravated over 10 or more years of follow-up.
