31090213|a|Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most widespread malignant cancers, with a high incidence and mortality all over the world. Aspirin (ASA) otherwise known as acetylsalicylic acid, is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug that has shown promising results in the prevention of chronic diseases, including several cancers. In previous studies, aspirin has been shown to reduce the incidence of CRC. Immune checkpoint blockade of T cell Ig and ITIM domain receptor (TIGIT) alone or combined with other immune checkpoint blockades moleculars has gained impressive results in the treatment of the melanoma and glioblastoma. Here, we found that TIGIT and Poliovirus receptor (PVR, CD155) are expressed in tumour cells; the TIGIT and CD155 protein expression in cancer tissue has been found to be significantly higher than that in the precancerous tissue. T cell Ig and ITIM domain receptor and CD226 were expressed in the lymphocytes near the tumour tissue and the adjacent tissues. Aspirin has been found to inhibit cancer cell viability and promote CRC cell apoptosis.Similarly, aspirin has also been found to increase pro-apoptotic protein Bax's expression. We found that the expression of TIGIT decreased with an increase in the concentration of aspirin and that the suppression of TIGIT can affect the effect of aspirin on cell proliferation. In this paper, we found that aspirin attenuates cancer cell proliferation and induces CRC cells apoptosis by down-regulating the expression of TIGIT, which provides new evidence for the application of aspirin in cancer treatment.
