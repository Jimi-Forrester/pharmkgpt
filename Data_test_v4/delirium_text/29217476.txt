29217476|a|Small ubiquitin-related modifiers (SUMOs) conjugated or bound to target proteins can affect protein trafficking, processing and solubility. SUMOylation has been suggested to play a role in the amyloid plaque and neurofibrillary tangle pathology of Alzheimer disease (AD) and related neurodegenerative diseases. The current study examines the impact of SUMO1 on processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) leading to the production and deposition of the amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide. An in vivo model of these pathways was developed by the generation of double transgenic mice over-expressing human SUMO1 and a mutant APP. The SUMO1-APP transgenics displayed normal APP processing but, at later ages, exhibited increased insoluble Abeta and plaque density accompanied by increased dendritic spine loss, more pronounced synaptic and cognitive deficits. These findings suggest a potential impairment in Abeta clearance as opposed to increased amyloid production. Examination of microglia indicated a reduction in the SUMO1-APP transgenics which is a possible mechanism for the SUMO1-mediated increase in amyloid load. These findings suggest an indirect activity of SUMO1 possibly in the removal of Abeta plaques rather than a direct impact on amyloid generation.
