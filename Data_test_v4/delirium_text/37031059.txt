37031059|a|Dementia is a chronic progressive cognitive decline illness that results in functional impairment. Vascular dementia (VaD), second only to Alzheimer's disease (AD), is one of the most prevalent forms of dementia in the elderly (aged over 65 years), with a varied presentation and unpredictable disease development caused by cerebrovascular or cardiovascular illness. To get a better understanding of the changes occurring in the brain and to drive therapy efforts, new biomarkers for early and precise diagnosis of AD and VaD are required. In this review, Firstly, we describe the subtypes of vascular dementia, their clinical features, pathogenesis, genetics implemented, and their associated neuroimaging and biomarkers, while describing extensively the recent biomarkers discovered in the literature. Secondly, we describe some of the well-documented and other less-defined risk factors and their association and pathophysiology in relation to vascular dementia. Finally, we follow recent updates in the management of vascular dementia along with its association and differentiation from Alzheimer's disease. The aim of this review is to gather the scattered updates and the most recent changes in blood, CSF, and neuroimaging biomarkers related to the multiple subtypes of vascular dementia along with its association with Alzheimer's dementia and diabetes mellitus.
