20043813|t|Oral health in Alzheimer's disease: a review.
20043813|a|The main data on oral health and dental pathologies affecting Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients were reviewed. Oral health declines and dental pathologies increase with progression of AD. Poor oral hygiene, difficulty in wearing dentures, and the inability to self-care, including carrying out oral hygiene procedures are the most probable cause of impaired oral health in AD. Collection of information on oral/dental conditions from AD patients or their caregivers/relatives is often difficult and scientific literature on the topic is sparse . The majority of data on the subject consist in retrospective studies affected to some extent by subjective views of dental professionals involved. Appropriate dental interventions in adult-onset dementia disorders will decrease pain and oral pathology and consequently could contribute to maintain enough oral and nutritional health in these patients. Dental treatment in early stages of the disease are important and should be finalized at producing a stable oral condition. This could improve the quality of life and contribute to decrease worsening of oral situations in the later stages of the disease when dental treatment may be difficult. The problem of awareness of good oral health for keeping quality of life more acceptable in adult-onset dementia disorders is discussed.
