30889901|a|The monocarbonyl analogue of curcumin (1E,4E)-1,5-Bis(2-methoxyphenyl)penta-1,4-dien-3-one (C1) has been used as a specific activator of the master gene transcription factor EB (TFEB) to correlate the activation of this nuclear factor with the increased activity of lysosomal glycohydrolases and their recruitment to the cell surface. The presence of active lysosomal glycohydrolases associated with the lipid microdomains has been extensively demonstrated, and their role in glycosphingolipid (GSL) remodeling in both physiological and pathological conditions, such as neurodegenerative disorders, has been suggested. Here, we demonstrate that Jurkat cell stimulation elicits TFEB nuclear translocation and an increase of both the expression of hexosaminidase subunit beta (HEXB), hexosaminidase subunit alpha (HEXA), and galactosidase beta 1 (GLB1) genes, and the recruitment of beta-hexosaminidase (Hex, EC 3.2.1.52) and beta-galactosidase (Gal, EC 3.2.1.23) on lipid microdomains. Treatment of Jurkat cells with the curcumin analogue C1 also resulted in an increase of both lysosomal glycohydrolase activity and their targeting to the cell surface. Similar effects of C1 on lysosomal glycohydrolase expression and their recruitment to lipid microdomains was observed by treating the SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line; the effects of C1 treatment were abolished by TFEB silencing. Together, these results clearly demonstrate the existence of a direct link between TFEB nuclear translocation and the transport of Hex and Gal from lysosomes to the plasma membrane.
