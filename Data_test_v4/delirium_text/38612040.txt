38612040|t|Cellular Internalization and Toxicity of Chitosan Nanoparticles Loaded with Nobiletin in Eukaryotic Cell Models (Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida albicans).
38612040|a|This study involved the synthesis and characterization of chitosan nanoparticles loaded with nobiletin (CNpN) and assessed their toxicity and cellular internalization in eukaryotic cell models (Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida albicans). Nanoparticles were prepared via the nanoprecipitation method and physicochemically characterized to determine their hydrodynamic diameter using dynamic light scattering (DLS), their surface charge through zeta-potential measurements, and their chemical structure via Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The hydrodynamic diameter and zeta-potential of chitosan nanoparticles (CNp) and CNpN were found to be 288.74 +- 2.37 nm and 596.60 +- 35.49 nm, and 34.51 +- 0.66 mV and 37.73 +- 0.19 mV, respectively. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images displayed a particle size of approximately 346 +- 69 nm, with notable sphericity for CNpN. FTIR analysis provided evidence of potential imine bonding between chitosan and nobiletin. Membrane integrity damage could be observed in both S. cerevisiae and C. albicans yeast stained with propidium iodide, demonstrating membrane integrity damage caused by CNp and CNpN, where higher concentration treatments inhibited the development of yeast cells. These findings suggest a selective therapeutic potential of CNpN, which could be promising for the development of antifungal and anticancer therapies. This study contributes to understanding the interaction between nanoparticles and eukaryotic cells, offering insights for future biomedical applications.
