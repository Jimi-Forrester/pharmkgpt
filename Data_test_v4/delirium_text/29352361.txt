29352361|t|The modified Ravitch approach for the management of severe anterior flail chest with bilateral sternochondral dislocations: a case report.
29352361|a|The management of flail chest continues to evolve as scientific evidence and surgical experience accumulates. Flail chest injuries that span the sternum present a rare and complicated injury pattern that can be challenging to manage both medically and surgically. Our patient is a 69-year-old involved in a high-speed motor vehicle crash with respiratory failure secondary to an anterior flail chest. Tomographic examination confirmed a sternal fracture with bilateral sternochondral dislocations and multiple rib fractures. The rib fractures created a lateral flail segment which extended towards the right side. An open Pectus exposure with a right anterolateral extension (modified Ravitch approach) and osteosynthesis plates accomplished stabilization of the chest wall, and contributed to weaning from mechanical ventilation.
