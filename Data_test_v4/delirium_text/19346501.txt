19346501|a|BACKGROUND: Cognitive decline leads to disability and increased health care expenditures. METHODS: Effectiveness of an intervention to stimulate multiple cognitive domains was determined using a format combining traditional and computer-based activities (Integrated Cognitive Stimulation and Training Program), 45 minutes a day, 2 days a week, for 6 weeks. Nonimpaired, mildly, and moderately-impaired participants > age 65 (n = 32) were randomly allocated into a control or experimental group. Using a repeated measures design participants were tested again postintervention and at 8 weeks follow-up. RESULTS: Statistically significant improvement on Dementia Rating Scale scores occurred for mildly and moderately impaired treatment participants (n = 15). Statistical significance was demonstrated on subscales of the WMS-III: Logical Memory I and Logical Memory II. CONCLUSION: Blending computer-based with traditional cognitive stimulation activities shows promise in preserving cognitive function in elders. Future studies to explore efficacy in larger, more diverse samples are needed.
