38064873|a|BACKGROUND: The objective of the present study is to analyze the epidemiological, clinical and functional characteristics of patients admitted to the University Hospital of Navarra due to SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as the predictors of mortality, during the first wave of the pandemic caused by this virus. METHODOLOGY: An observational, retrospective study was performed, including all hospitalized patients older than 75 years. Information has been obtained on multiple variables, among which it is worth mentioning previous geriatric syndromes or those that have appeared during hospitalization, or past medical history considered relevant in SARS-CoV-2 infection. A descriptive analysis of the data, comparisons according to various factors of interest and multivariate analysis to analyze factors associated with mortality were carried out. RESULTS: Data have been obtained from a total of 426 patients with a mean age of 83.2 years (52.6% men). 34.7% died in hospital and 4.5% within 1 month after hospital discharge. The factors related to mortality were: worse baseline functional status, chronic kidney disease, and fever or dyspnea as forms of presentation. The most frequent typical symptoms were: fever, dyspnea, cough, asthenia and hyporexia. Up to 42.1% presented delirium as a symptom of atypical onset. We observed a functional deterioration that was not recover after a month of follow-up (baseline Barthel index 81.12; 70.08 at discharge; 75.55 after a month). CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 infection has caused high mortality rates in older adults. In this age group, the atypical presentation of this disease and functional deterioration during hospitalization are frequent. In the present study, a worse previous functional status has been identified as a predictor of mortality. More studies are needed to evaluate the impact that the disease and hospitalization have on the older patient, with the aim of implementing preventive, diagnostic and therapeutic measures that are necessary to avoid functional deterioration and adverse health events related to it.
