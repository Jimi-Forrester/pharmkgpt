39433809|a|To investigate the status of dignity impairment symptoms in critically ill patients after ICU treatment and conduct a systematic analysis of its influencing factors, aiming to provide reference for clinical medical decision-making by healthcare professionals. A cross-sectional survey study. From April 15th to 21st, 2024, a cross-sectional survey was conducted in 40 tertiary Grade A comprehensive hospitals in 9 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions including Sichuan Province, Zhejiang Province, and Chongqing Municipality. Various critically ill patients who were admitted to ICU treatment were surveyed using a general information questionnaire and the Dignity Inventory. A total of 346 questionnaires were collected in this survey, with 333 valid questionnaires and an effective response rate of 96%. The incidence rate of dignity impairment symptoms in critically ill patients after ICU treatment was 39%. Multifactor logistic regression analysis showed that age [OR = 1.124, 95%CI=(1.067-1.184)], frequency of visits [OR = 1.875, 95%CI=(1.075-3.269)], length of ICU stay [OR = 1.352, 95%CI=(1.108-1.649)], and tracheotomy upon discharge [OR = 2.269, 95%CI=(1.273-4.044)] were risk factors for dignity impairment symptoms in critically ill patients after ICU treatment. Number of children [OR = 0.247, 95%CI=(0.106-0.576)] was a protective factor for dignity impairment symptoms in critically ill patients after ICU treatment. Although the incidence of dignity impairment symptoms in critically ill patients after ICU treatment is relatively low, the psychological trauma it causes cannot be ignored. Healthcare professionals must actively establish and improve its prevention and management system.
