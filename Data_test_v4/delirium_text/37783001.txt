37783001|t|Establishment of induced pluripotent stem cells IRMBi005-A from a patient with sporadic Alzheimer's disease.
37783001|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurological disorder and the most common form of dementia worldwide. Sporadic Alzheimer's disease (sAD) cases are the main forms, over 95% of AD cases, but still poorly understood. Thereby there is a crucial need to develop in vitro models for studying this multifactorial disorder. Here, we report the reprogramming of skin fibroblasts from a 57-years-old male donor. The new generated iPSC cell line has a normal karyotype and, is pluripotent since it demonstrates the ability to differentiate in vitro into the three germ layers. This iPSC line will be used to understand pathological mechanisms of sAD.
