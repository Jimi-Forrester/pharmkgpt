37810693|t|Comprehensive Review of Nutraceuticals against Cognitive Decline Associated with Alzheimer's Disease.
37810693|a|Nowadays, nutraceuticals are being incorporated into functional foods or used as supplements with nonpharmacological approaches in the prevention and management of several illnesses, including age-related conditions and chronic neurodegenerative diseases. Nutraceuticals are apt for preventing and treating such disorders because of their nontoxic, non-habit-forming, and efficient bioactivities for promoting neurological well-being due to their ability to influence cellular processes such as neurogenesis, synaptogenesis, synaptic transmission, neuro-inflammation, oxidative stress, cell death modulation, and neuronal survival. The capacity of nutraceuticals to modify all of these processes reveals the potential to develop food-based strategies to aid brain development and enhance brain function, prevent and ameliorate neurodegeneration, and possibly reverse the cognitive impairment observed in Alzheimer's disease, the most predominant form of dementia in the elderly. The current review summarizes the experimental evidence of the neuroprotective capacity of nutraceuticals against Alzheimer's disease, describing their mechanisms of action and the in vitro and in vivo models applied to evaluate their neuroprotective potential.
