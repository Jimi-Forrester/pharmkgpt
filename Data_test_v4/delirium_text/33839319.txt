33839319|t|Stressed mitochondria: A target to intrude alzheimer's disease.
33839319|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the inoperable, incapacitating, neuropsychiatric, and degenerative manifestation that drastically affects human life quality. The current medications target extra-neuronal senile plaques, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles, cholinergic deficits, and excitotoxicity. Among novel pathways and targets, bioenergetic and resultant mitochondrial dysfunction has been recognized as essential factors that decide the neuronal fate and consequent neurodegeneration in AD. The crucial attributes of mitochondria, including bioenergesis, signaling, sensing, integrating, and transmitting biological signals contribute to optimum networking of neuronal dynamics and make them indispensable for cell survival. In AD, mitochondrial dysfunction and mitophagy are a preliminary and critical event that aggravates the pathological cascade. Stress is known to promote and exaggerate the neuropathological alteration during neurodegeneration and metabolic impairments, especially in the cortico-limbic system, besides adversely affecting the normal physiology and mitochondrial dynamics. Stress involves the allocation of energy resources for neuronal survival. Chronic and aggravated stress response leads to excessive release of glucocorticoids by activation of the hypothalamic-pituitaryadrenal (HPA) axis. By acting through their receptors, glucocorticoids influence adverse mitochondrial changes and alter mtDNA transcription, mtRNA expression, hippocampal mitochondrial network, and ultimately mitochondrial physiology. Chronic stress also affects mitochondrial dynamics by changing metabolic and neuro-endocrinal signalling, aggravating oxidative stress, provoking inflammatory mediators, altering tropic factors, influencing gene expression, and modifying epigenetic pathways. Thus, exploring chronic stress-induced glucocorticoid dysregulation and resultant bio-behavioral and psychosomatic mitochondrial alterations may be a feasible narrative to investigate and unravel the mysterious pathobiology of AD.
