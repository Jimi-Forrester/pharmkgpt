36921910|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Sanwei DouKou decoction (SDKD) is a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) prescription derived from the Tibetan medical book "Si Bu Yi Dian" and is clinically used for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the potential mechanism of SDKD treatment for AD remains elusive. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study aims to explore the potential mechanism by which SDKD alleviates AD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Extracts of SDKD were identified with Gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (GC-MS). 5 x FAD mice were treated with SDKD for 8 weeks. The efficacy of SDKD against AD was evaluated by in-vivo experiments. Morris water maze and contextual fear conditioning tests were used to detect the learning and memory ability of mice. Hematoxylin-eosin staining (H&E) staining was used to observe the pathological changes of brain tissue. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect the positive expression of Nestin in hippocampus. In in-vitro experiments, the Cell Counting Kit 8 (CCK-8) technique was used to detect cell viability, the proliferation of neural stem cells was detected by immunofluorescence staining, the intracellular protein expression was detected by Western Blot. RESULTS: The results of this study suggested that SDKD may ameliorate AD. SDKD significantly shortened the escape latency of mice in the Morris water maze experiment, increased the number of times the mice crossed the target quadrant, and prolonged freezing time in the contextual fear memory experiment. SDKD also improved neuronal pathology in the hippocampus, decreased neuronal loss, and increased Nestin protein levels. Furthermore, in in-vitro experiments, SDKD could significantly increase Neural stem cells (NSCs) viability, promoted NSCs proliferation, and also effectively activated the Wnt/beta-catenin signalling pathway, increased Wnt family member 3A (Wnt3a), beta-catenin and CyclinD1 protein levels, activated the NSCs proliferation pathways in AD model mouse brain tissue. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrated that sanwei doukou decoction can ameliorate AD by increasing endogenous neural stem cells proliferation through the Wnt/beta-catenin signalling pathway. Our observations justify the traditional use of SDKD for a treatment of AD in nervous system.
