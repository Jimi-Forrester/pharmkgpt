39937001|t|Targeted Cellular Treatment of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus.
39937001|a|Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a systemic autoimmune disease affecting all organ systems. The disease preferentially affects females of childbearing age. It runs a variable course. It may run a mild course that may never lead to severe disease and manifestations from critical organ systems. However, it may also run an undulating course with periods of mild and severe disease. It may run as a mild disease, quickly deteriorating to severe disease and affecting multiple organ systems. Various immune pathways related both to the innate and adaptive immune response are involved in the pathogenesis of SLE. Various drugs have been developed targeting cellular and molecular targets in these pathways. Interferons are involved in the pathogenesis of SLE, and various drugs have been developed to target this pathway. T and B lymphocytes are involved in the pathophysiology of SLE. Various treatment modalities targeting cellular targets are available for the treatment of SLE. These include biologic agents targeting B lymphocytes. However, some patients have disease refractory to these treatment modalities. For these patients, cell-based therapies may be used. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation involving autologous cells is an option in the treatment of refractory SLE. Mesenchymal stem cells are also applied in the treatment of SLE. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy is a novel treatment also used in SLE management. This novel treatment method holds major promise for the management of autoimmune diseases and, in particular, SLE. Major hurdles to be overcome are the logistics involved, as well as the need for specialized facilities. This review focuses on novel treatment modalities in SLE targeting cellular and molecular targets in the immune system.
