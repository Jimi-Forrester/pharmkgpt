35647292|t|The "Counseling+" Roles of the Speech-Language Pathologist Serving Older Adults With Mild Cognitive Impairment and Dementia From Alzheimer's Disease.
35647292|a|Purpose: Persons with dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are major consumers of services provided by speech-language pathologists (SLPs). These services include not only direct assessment and treatment of communication and swallowing but also counseling, collaboration, prevention, and wellness. These "counseling+" activities can be especially challenging for SLPs to deliver because of the lack of evidence, as well as the complex nature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other conditions that cause MCI and dementia. Method: This tutorial is written by a speech-language pathologist, a neuropsychologist, and a geriatric psychiatrist to provide education, resources, and recommendations for SLPs delivering counseling+ activities to patients with MCI and dementia from AD and related disorders. Results and Conclusions: We describe counseling+ activities across the continuum of care ranging from educating and conducting cognitive screenings with adults experiencing age-related cognitive decline to supporting end-of-life wishes. Because of their expertise in communication, SLPs can provide an array of important leading and supporting services to patients, their family, and other health care professionals on the care team, such as providing patients with appropriate feedback following a cognitive screening and helping caregivers identify the communicative intent of a responsive behavior. The demand for SLP services for patients with MCI and dementia will grow significantly over the next few decades, necessitating more systematic research and clinical evidence in this area.
