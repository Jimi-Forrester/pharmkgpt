32759640|a|The diagnosis of cancer and its treatment have an incomparable impact on a patient's life. In the early postoperative stages after the surgical treatment of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), functions and well-being are limited, which leads to a fundamental decline of the quality of life (QoL). To date, no studies have been performed that focus on the development of special aspects during the time of the in-patient stay of OSCC patients. With the results of this cross-sectional study, we are able to identify those patients who tend to require special support. This cross-sectional study determined the postoperative QoL with a questionnaire (QU) that was handed out twice to OSCC patients after surgery during their inpatient stay. The questions were based on the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC)'s Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ)-C30 and QLQ-H&N35. In our study, we found that for postoperative OSCC patients, eating, swallowing and speech were influenced the most. After decannulation, tracheotomy showed no impact on functions. Social contact was impaired at both timepoints. Especially female patients consider themselves to be more impaired on the scale of social contact. QoL should be checked with a standardized QU as an established tool during hospitalization in every oncology department. Only this procedure can pinpoint those patients who have struggles with their surgical outcome and need more assistance.
