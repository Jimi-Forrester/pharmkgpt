Therefore, this study aimed to compare the nutritional status and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of OA patients between gender and age group. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 131 OA patients in Rehabilitation Health Organisation, Terengganu. Socio-demographic, clinical, lifestyle histories, 24-hour dietary intake and HRQOL were assessed using a structured questionnaire. RESULTS: Knee and/or hip OA patients recruited consisted of 19.1% of men and 80.9 % of women collectively with a mean age of 61.81 (9.28) years ranging from 38 to 83 years. The percentages of underweight, normal, overweight, and obese patients were 1.5%, 12.2%, 36.7%, and 49.6%, respectively. Further assessment of HRQOL showed that the highest mean score was obtained by the social functioning (SF) domain of 41.25 (27.16), while the mental domain scored the least mean score of 21.15 (20.92). In terms of gender breakdown, the males had significantly greater weight and height but lower body fat (BF) compared to their female counterparts, as well as a significantly higher energy, carbohydrate and protein intake. According to the age group, patients aged < 60 years had significantly greater weight, height, and BF than those aged >= 60 years. CONCLUSION: This study is an important baseline reference for proper OA management and prevention by providing crucial nutritional status and HRQOL information.
