37078089|t|Post-ischemic inflammatory response in the brain: Targeting immune cell in ischemic stroke therapy.
37078089|a|An ischemic stroke occurs when the blood supply is obstructed to the vascular basin, causing the death of nerve cells and forming the ischemic core. Subsequently, the brain enters the stage of reconstruction and repair. The whole process includes cellular brain damage, inflammatory reaction, blood-brain barrier destruction, and nerve repair. During this process, the proportion and function of neurons, immune cells, glial cells, endothelial cells, and other cells change. Identifying potential differences in gene expression between cell types or heterogeneity between cells of the same type helps to understand the cellular changes that occur in the brain and the context of disease. The recent emergence of single-cell sequencing technology has promoted the exploration of single-cell diversity and the elucidation of the molecular mechanism of ischemic stroke, thus providing new ideas and directions for the diagnosis and clinical treatment of ischemic stroke.
