37350918|t|Integrating Comorbidity Knowledge for Alzheimer's Disease Drug Repurposing using Multi-task Graph Neural Network.
37350918|a|Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a multifactorial disease that shares common etiologies with its multiple comorbidities, especially vascular diseases. To predict repurposable drugs for AD utilizing the relatively well-investigated comorbidities' knowledge, we proposed a multi-task graph neural network (GNN)-based pipeline that incorporates the corresponding biomedical interactome of these diseases with their genetic markers and effective therapeutics. Our pipeline can accurately capture the interactions and disease classification in the network. Next, we predicted drugs that might interact with the AD module by the node embedding similarity. Our candidates are mostly BBB permeable, and literature evidence showed their potential for treating AD pathologies, accompanying symptoms, or cotreating AD pathology and its common comorbidities. Our pipeline demonstrated a workable strategy that predicts drug candidates with current knowledge of biological interplays between AD and several vascular diseases.
