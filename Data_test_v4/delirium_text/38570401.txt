38570401|t|SERS biosensor with plastic antibodies for detection of a cancer biomarker protein.
38570401|a|Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) is a powerful method for detecting breast cancer-specific biomarkers due to its extraordinary enhancement effects obtained by localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) in metallic nanostructures at hotspots. In this research, gold nanostars (AuNSs) were used as SERS probes to detect a cancer biomarker at very low concentrations. To this end, we combined molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) as a detection layer with SERS for the detection of the biomarker CA 15-3 in point-of-care (PoC) analysis. This required two main steps: (i) the deposition of MIPs on a gold electrode, followed by a second step (ii) antibody binding with AuNSs containing a suitable Raman reporter to enhance Raman signaling (SERS). The MPan sensor was prepared by electropolymerization of the monomer aniline in the presence of CA 15-3. The template molecule was then extracted from the polymer using sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). In parallel, a control material was prepared in the absence of the protein (NPan). Surface modification for the control was performed using electrochemical techniques such as cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The performance of the sensor was evaluated using the SERS technique, in which the MPan sensor is first incubated with the protein and then exposed to the SERS probe. Under optimized conditions, the device showed a linear response to CA 15-3 concentrations from 0.016 to 248.51 U mL-1 in a PBS buffer at pH 7.4 in 1000-fold diluted serum. Overall, this approach demonstrates the potential of SERS as an optical reader and opens a new avenue for biosensing applications.
