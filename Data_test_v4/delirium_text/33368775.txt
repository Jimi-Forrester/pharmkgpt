33368775|t|Imaging Transcriptomics in Neurodegenerative Diseases.
33368775|a|Imaging transcriptomics investigates the relationship between neuroanatomical/neuroimaging features and gene expression. The spatial and temporal distribution of the expressed genes and their pattern of spreading over time can contribute to elucidating cellular and molecular processes involved in neurodegeneration. In this study, we review recent findings regarding the correlation between neuroimaging and expression data in neurodegenerative diseases with a focus on Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. An association between gene expression data and different neuroimaging neurodegeneration features, such as R2 relaxation time and volumetric cortical atrophy, was established. Several positive and negative expression correlations were identified, and they confirmed the focal nature of neurodegeneration. Positively correlated genes were associated with cell motility, immune system activity, neuroinflammation, and microglia. Data from connectome studies support the hypothesis of selective network vulnerability and a temporal spreading pattern in neurodegenerative pathologies. Genes related to cellular mobility and transport are overexpressed in the neuroimaging-defined delineated areas of degeneration. In addition, expression enrichment of genes involved in immunological processes in vulnerable regions-such as the Toll-like receptor, a receptor involved in innate immunity-plays a major role in neuroinflammation in neurodegenerative diseases. However, substantial limitations must be overcome in future studies: the lack of high-quality resolution expression data, the lack of standardized study protocols, and insufficient sensitive early stage neuroimaging markers of degeneration. Identifying neuroimaging and expression prodromal biomarkers and investigating their causal relation in the preclinical disease stage may enable early targeted therapy before the onset of irreversible brain changes.
