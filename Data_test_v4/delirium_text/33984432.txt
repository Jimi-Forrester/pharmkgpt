33984432|t|Pronounced anti-neuroinflammatory jasmonates and terpenes isolated from lychee seeds.
33984432|a|Lychee is a favorite fruit of the Cantonese and native to Southeast Asia. In this study, the anti-neuroinflammatory bioactive compounds of lychee seeds have been carried out. Five new jasmonates (1, 2, 6-8) and seventeen known compounds were isolated using a series of chemical and chromatographic methods. Their chemical structures were identified through comprehensive spectroscopic analysis. Anti-neuroinflammatory activities were assayed and evaluated for the purified compounds. Most of the compounds exhibited pronounced anti-neuroinflammatory activities on nitric oxide (NO) induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in BV-2 microglia cells. Moreover, compounds 1, 2 and 20 could reduce the expression of LPS-induced pro-inflammatory factors (iNOS and COX-2), inhibit the expression of mRNA levels of iNOS, COX-2, IL-6 and block NF-kappaB nuclear translocation in dose-dependent manners. This study suggested that lychee phytochemicals could be benefit to some neuroinflammatory-associated diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease.
