31031488|a|BACKGROUND: Direct laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation lead to increase in heart rate and blood pressure. This can cause serious complications in patients with coronary artery disease, reactive airways, or intracranial neuropathology. Preoperative anxiety is associated with greater level of postoperative pain. Attenuation of anxiety and hemodynamic response to laryngoscopy and intubation are cornerstone of better anesthetic outcome. Gabapentinoids (gabapentin and pregabalin) have been known to possess anxiolytic, analgesic, and anticonvulsant properties. AIM: The aim of this study is to determine the effects of oral pregabalin on anxiolysis and attenuation of stress response to laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation. STUDY DESIGN: This was a prospective randomized double-blind placebo controlled study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 60 patients ASA physical status Class I and II, undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy, were randomly allocated into two groups receiving either oral placebo or oral pregabalin 150 mg, 60 min before induction of anesthesia. Visual analog scale (VAS) for anxiety was recorded before, and 60 min after giving the drug. Hemodynamic parameters (heart rate, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and mean arterial pressure) were recorded before, and 60 min after giving drug, during and 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 min after intubation. RESULTS: During preinduction, pregabalin showed a decrease in VAS and attenuation of stress response to laryngoscopy and intubation compared to that of placebo. The premedicated patients were hemodynamically stable perioperatively without side effects. CONCLUSION: Pregabalin is effective in attenuating preoperative anxiety and stress response to endotracheal intubation.
