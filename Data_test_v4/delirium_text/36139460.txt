36139460|t|A Review of the Pharmacological Potential of Spatholobus suberectus Dunn on Cancer.
36139460|a|Spatholobus suberectus Dunn (SSD) has been extensively employed in Traditional Chinese Medicine to treat several ailments. SSD and its active compounds are effective therapeutic agents for treating a variety of diseases with negligible side effects. Therefore, we aimed to investigate its phytochemistry, pharmacology, and potential therapeutic effects exclusively in cancer prevention and treatment. Phytochemical and pharmacological information was collected and arranged in a rational order. SSD has been frequently attributed to having antioxidant, anti-diabetic, anti-inflammatory, hematopoietic, neuroprotective, antimicrobial, and anticancer properties. Evidence has indicated that the bioactive constituents in SSD have attracted increasing scientific attention due to their preventive role in cancers. Further, the present review provides the current information on the health implications of SSD, thus allowing for future clinical trials to explore its restorative benefits. All data of in vitro and animal investigations of SSD, as well as its effect on human health, were obtained from an electronic search and library database. The diverse pharmacological potential of SSD provides an opportunity for preclinical drug discovery, and this comprehensive review strongly indicates that SSD is an excellent anti-tumorigenic agent that modulates or prevents breast cancer.
