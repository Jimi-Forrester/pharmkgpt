29736357|t|Anticholinergic Toxicity Secondary to Overuse of Topricin Cream, a Homeopathic Medication.
29736357|a|Adverse reactions from over-the-counter medications present a challenge to physicians. Homeopathic medicine is an alternative practice, originating in Germany and gaining popularity in the United States. It utilizes dilute preparations of substances in order to treat and cure disease. Patients may potentially suffer serious effects from the use of these products as the contents and concentrations are often unclear. Here, we describe a case of suspected atropine toxicity due to the overuse of a topical homeopathic cream, Topricin, which contains belladonna, a plant containing atropine.
