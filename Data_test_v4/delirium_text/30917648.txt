30917648|a|BACKGROUND: Delirium is common and underdiagnosed among patients in hospitals, and is associated with complications, increased mortality, onset of dementia and need for nursing home care. Cognitive impairment from other causes is also common among hospitalised elderly people and is a key risk factor for delirium. Since no relevant prevalence studies have been undertaken in Norwegian hospitals, we investigated the prevalence of delirium among elderly patients in Norwegian emergency departments on World Delirium Awareness Day, 14 March 2018. MATERIAL AND METHOD: We included patients >= 75 years who arrived in ten Norwegian emergency departments between 08:00 and 22:00 on that day. We identified delirium and cognitive impairment using the '4AT' screening tool and registered the patients' age and gender and the hospital and department to which they were admitted (internal medicine, surgery, orthopaedics, 'other'). RESULTS: Of 118 included patients, 20 (17 per cent) showed signs of delirium and 36 (30 per cent) showed signs of other forms of cognitive impairment. All hospitals and all categories of departments received patients with signs of delirium and cognitive impairment. INTERPRETATION: Delirium and other forms of cognitive impairment are both common among elderly patients in Norwegian emergency departments. Our results indicate that all hospital departments who treat elderly patients frequently observe these issues. All departments should therefore have routines to identify and deal with patients who suffer from delirium and cognitive impairment.
