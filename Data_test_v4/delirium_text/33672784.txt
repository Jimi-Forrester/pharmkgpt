33672784|t|Disturbance of Mitochondrial Dynamics and Mitochondrial Therapies in Atherosclerosis.
33672784|a|Mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with a wide range of chronic human disorders, including atherosclerosis and diabetes mellitus. Mitochondria are dynamic organelles that undergo constant turnover in living cells. Through the processes of mitochondrial fission and fusion, a functional population of mitochondria is maintained, that responds to the energy needs of the cell. Damaged or excessive mitochondria are degraded by mitophagy, a specialized type of autophagy. These processes are orchestrated by a number of proteins and genes, and are tightly regulated. When one or several of these processes are affected, it can lead to the accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria, deficient energy production, increased oxidative stress and cell death-features that are described in many human disorders. While severe mitochondrial dysfunction is known to cause specific and mitochondrial disorders in humans, progressing damage of the mitochondria is also observed in a wide range of other chronic diseases, including cancer and atherosclerosis, and appears to play an important role in disease development. Therefore, correction of mitochondrial dynamics can help in developing new therapies for the treatment of these conditions. In this review, we summarize the recent knowledge on the processes of mitochondrial turnover and the proteins and genes involved in it. We provide a list of known mutations that affect mitochondrial function, and discuss the emerging therapeutic approaches.
