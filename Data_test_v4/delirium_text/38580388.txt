38580388|a|BACKGROUND: Cystitis are commonly treated with antibiotics, although non-antibiotic options could be considered for healthy non-pregnant women. Shared decision making (SDM) can be used in cystitis management to discuss the various treatment options but is not frequently applied in general practice. AIM: Identifying barriers and facilitators for applying SDM in cystitis management in general practice. DESIGN & SETTING: Qualitative explorative research in general practice with healthcare professionals (HCPs; general practitioners (GPs) and GP assistants) and healthy non-pregnant women with a recent history of cystitis (patients). METHOD: Individual semi-structured interviews were conducted between May and October 2022. We applied a combination of thematic and framework analysis. RESULTS: Ten GPs, seven GP assistants, and fifteen patients were interviewed. We identified three main barriers and one key facilitator: 1) applying SDM is deemed inefficient; 2) HCPs presume that patients expect antibiotic treatment and some HCPs consider non-antibiotic treatment inferior; 3) Patients are largely unaware of the various non-antibiotic treatment options for cystitis; 4) HCPs recognise some benefits of applying SDM in cystitis management, including reduced antibiotic use and improved patient empowerment, and patients appreciate involvement in treatment decisions, but preferences for SDM vary. CONCLUSION: SDM is infrequently applied in cystitis treatment in general practice due to the current efficient cystitis management, HCPs' perceptions, and patient unawareness. Nevertheless, both HCPs and patients recognise the long-term benefits of applying SDM in cystitis management. Our findings facilitate the development of tailored interventions to increase the application of SDM which should be co-created with HCPs and patients and fit into the current efficient cystitis management.
