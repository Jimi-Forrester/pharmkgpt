29560318|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the immediate therapeutic effects of mental singing while walking intervention on gait disturbances in hemiplegic stroke patients. METHODS: Eligible, post-stroke, hemiplegic patients were prospectively enrolled in this study. The inclusion criteria were a diagnosis of hemiplegia due to stroke, and ability to walk more than 10 m with or without gait aids. Each patient underwent structured music therapy sessions comprising 7 consecutive tasks, and were trained to sing in their mind (mental singing) while walking. Before, and after training sessions, gait ability was assessed using the 10-Meter Walk Test (10MWT), the Timed Up and Go test (TUG), gait velocity, cadence and stride length. RESULTS: Twenty patients were enrolled in the interventions. Following the mental singing while walking intervention, significant improvement was observed in the 10MWT (13.16+-7.61 to 12.27+-7.58; p=0.002) and the TUG test (19.36+-15.37 to 18.42+-16.43; p=0.006). Significant improvement was also seen in gait cadence (90.36+-29.11 to 95.36+-30.2; p<0.001), stride length (90.99+-33.4 to 98.17+-35.33; p<0.001) and velocity (0.66+-0.45 to 0.71+-0.47; p<0.002). CONCLUSION: These results indicate the possible effects of mental singing while walking on gait in patients diagnosed with hemiplegic stroke.
