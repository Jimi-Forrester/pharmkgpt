36657433|a|Acute alcoholic hallucinosis is a psychotic disorder characterized by a predominance of auditory hallucinations with delusions and affective symptoms in the clinical picture. Classically, it develops as part of the alcohol withdrawal syndrome. The prevalence of acute alcoholic hallucinosis ranks second among alcohol-related psychoses after alcohol delirium. The study aimed to systematize the scientific data on the history of alcoholic hallucinosis, its pathogenesis, clinical presentation, and treatment approaches. A literature search was performed in PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, and eLibrary. The following words and combinations were used as search strings: (alcoholic hallucinosis OR alcoholic psychosis OR alcohol-related psychosis OR alcohol-induced psychosis OR alcohol-induced psychotic disorder OR complicated alcohol withdrawal syndrome) NOT (animal OR rat OR mouse). The relevant information concerning the history of acute alcoholic hallucinosis, its pathogenesis, clinical picture, and treatment approaches was systematized and summarized. This review presents relevant findings regarding acute alcoholic hallucinosis. Limitations of the review include the use of heterogeneous and mostly descriptive studies and studies on small cohorts of patients.
