33906885|a|Hip fracture is a common injury in elderly patients. In Japan, the number of super-old patients-age >90 years-with hip fractures has increased drastically over time. Available strategies for anaesthetic management for hip fracture surgery include general anaesthesia, neuraxial anaesthesia and peripheral nerve block. However, general and neuraxial anaesthesia are often avoided for various reasons, particularly in elderly patients. In recent years, peripheral nerve block has proven effective in various surgical procedures. Additionally, dexmedetomidine exhibits neuroprotective effects and has been used safely in super-old patients. Herein, we demonstrate successful anaesthetic management with peripheral nerve block under dexmedetomidine sedation for open reduction and internal fixation of a femoral neck fracture in a 97-year-old patient.
