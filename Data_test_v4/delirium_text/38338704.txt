38338704|a|In recent years, research has shown that oxidative stress plays a significant role in chronic inflammatory conditions. The alteration of the oxidant/antioxidant balance leads to the appearance of free radicals, important molecules involved in both diabetes mellitus and periodontal disease. Diabetes is considered to be one of the major risk factors of periodontal disease and the inflammation characterizing this condition is associated with oxidative stress, implicitly resulting in oxidative damage to DNA. 8-Hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) is the most common stable product of oxidative DNA damage caused by reactive oxygen species, and its levels have been reported to increase in body fluids and tissues during inflammatory conditions. 8-OHdG emerges as a pivotal biomarker for assessing oxidative DNA damage, demonstrating its relevance across diverse health conditions, including neurodegenerative disorders, cancers, inflammatory conditions, and periodontal disease. Continued research in this field is crucial for developing more precise treatments and understanding the detailed link between oxidative stress and the progression of periodontitis. The use of the 8-OHdG biomarker in assessing and managing chronic periodontitis is an area of increased interest in dental research, with the potential to provide crucial information for diagnosis and treatment.
