33562664|t|Patients with Subarachnoid Hemorrhage Exhibit Disturbed Expression Patterns of the Circadian Rhythm Gene Period-2.
33562664|a|Circadian rhythm gene expression in cerebral pacemaker regions is regulated by a transcriptional-translational feedback loop across the 24-h day-night cycle. In preclinical models of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), cyclic gene expression is disrupted. Stabilization of circadian rhythm gene expression attenuates susceptibility to ischemic damage in both neuronal and myocardial tissues. In this clinical observational study, circadian rhythm gene Period-2 (Per2) mRNA expression levels were determined from blood leukocytes and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cells via real-time PCR on days 1, 7 and 14 after aneurysm rupture in 49 patients with spontaneous SAH. CSF Per2 expression was markedly suppressed immediately after SAH and remained suppressed over the course of two weeks of ICU treatment. Short-term mortality as well as occurrence of delirium was associated with greater extent of Per2 suppression on day 1 after SAH. Patients that developed delayed cerebral ischemia exhibited comparatively lower Per2 expression levels on day 7 after SAH, while presence of vasospasm remained unaffected. However, Per2 expression did not differ in patient groups with favourable or non-favourable functional neurological outcome (modified Rankin Scales 1-3 vs. 4-6). While our findings suggest a potential protective effect of stable circadian rhythm gene expression on the extent of ischemic damage, this effect was confined to the early disease course and was not reflected in patients' functional neurological outcome.
