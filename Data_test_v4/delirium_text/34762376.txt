34762376|a|OBJECTIVE: To compare the clinical efficacy of abdominal acupoint thread embedding therapy based on "brain-intestinal connection" combined with donepezil hydrochloride tablets and oral donepezil hydrochloride tablets alone for mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) and observe its effects on amyloid precursor protein (APP) and beta-amyloid protein1-42 (Abeta1-42). METHODS: Sixty patients with AD were randomly divided into an observation group (30 cases, 3 cases dropped off) and a control group (30 cases, 3 cases dropped off). The patients in the control group were treated with donepezil hydrochloride tablets (5 mg per day); based on the treatment in the control group, the patients in the observation group were treated with abdominal acupoint thread embedding therapy at Zhongwan (CV 12), Xiawan (CV 10), Huaroumen (ST 24), Wailing (ST 26), Daheng (SP 15), etc., once every 10 days. Both groups were treated for 2 months. The mini-mental state examination (MMSE), Alzheimer's disease assessment scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog), activity of daily living scale (ADL), neuropsychiatric inventory questionnaire (NPI) as well as the serum levels of APP and Abeta1-42 were observed before and after treatment in the two groups. RESULTS: After treatment, the MMSE scores in the two groups were higher than those before treatment (P<0.05), and the ADAS-Cog, ADL and NPI scores were lower than those before treatment (P<0.05). After treatment, the MMSE score in the observation group was higher than that in the control group (P<0.05), and the ADAS-Cog, ADL and NPI scores were lower than those in the control group (P<0.05). After treatment, the serum levels of APP and Abeta1-42 were lower than those before treatment (P<0.05), and the serum levels of APP and Abeta1-42 in the observation group was lower than those in the control group (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: The abdominal acupoint thread embedding therapy based on the theory of "brain-intestinal connection" combined with donepezil hydrochloride tablets can improve cognitive function, self-care ability of daily life and mental behavior, and reduce the serum levels of APP and Abeta1-42 in patients with mild-to-moderate AD, which have superior clinical effect to donepezil hydrochloride tablets alone.
