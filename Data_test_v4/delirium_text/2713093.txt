2713093|t|An attempt to evaluate diagnostic and prognostic significance of blood endogenous ethanol in alcoholics and their relatives.
2713093|a|Endogenous ethanol in the blood of human subjects was measured by gas chromatography. In healthy males, 12-13-year-old boys (sons of alcoholic and nonalcoholic fathers), and alcoholic inpatients (after cessation of all drugs), the endogenous ethanol levels ranged from 0 to 4.3 mg/l. The results showed no significant differences between the groups. At the period of alcohol withdrawal reactions the concentrations of endogenous ethanol were minimal in patients with delirium tremens and maximal in patients with mild alcohol withdrawal syndrome, the dynamics of this parameter being dependent on the severity of the alcohol withdrawal syndrome and the nature of the drugs prescribed.
