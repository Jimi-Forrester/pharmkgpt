31279498|a|INTRODUCTION: Hip fracture in the elderly is one of the most prevalent diagnoses in Orthopedic Surgery Departments. It has a great impact in medical, economic and social terms. Our objective is to analyze clinical impact of a co-management care model between orthopedic surgery and internal medicine departments for elderly patients admitted with hip fracture in a tertiary referral hospital. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of patients older than 65 years old admitted with hip fracture between January 2005-August 2006 (HIST cohort) without a co-management care model, and between January 2008-August 2010 (COFRAC cohort) with a co-manEdadment care model. Analysis of demographic, clinical and surgery characteristics, complications incidence and mortality and re-admissions at 30 days was made. RESULTS: A total of 701 patients were included (471 HIST, 230 COFRAC). There were no differences in sex, gender, time to surgery, type of anesthesia and surgery, length of stay, ambulation at discharge and 30-days emergency room consultation, readmissions or mortality at 30 days. There were differences in identification of polypatological patients (16.8 vs. 24.4%, P=0.02), presence of osteoporosis (3.9 vs. 7.6%, P=0.03), motor deficit (3.5 vs. 8.8%, P=0.03), number of chronic drugs (3.7+-2.5 vs. 4.3+-3.2, P<0.01), diagnosis of delirium (15.6 vs. 20.9%, P=0.048), constipation (80.3 vs. 74.7%, p<0.001), monitoring of anemia (83.3 vs. 97.1%, P>0.01) and renal failure at discharge (44.5 vs. 97.3%, P<0.01) and hospital mortality (4.6 vs. 1.3%, P=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Co-management for elderly patients admitted with hip fracture provides a better information about previously chronic conditions, a higher control of hospital complications and decreases hospital mortality.
