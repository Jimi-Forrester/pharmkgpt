22332002|t|Formation of the 42-mer Amyloid beta Radical and the Therapeutic Role of Superoxide Dismutase in Alzheimer's Disease.
22332002|a|Oxidative stress is closely involved in age-related diseases and ageing itself. There is evidence of the leading contribution of oxidative damage to neurodegenerative disease, in contrast to other diseases where oxidative stress plays a secondary role. The 42-mer amyloid beta (Abeta42) peptide is thought to be a culprit in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Abeta42 aggregates form the oligomeric assembly and show neurotoxicity, causing synaptic dysfunction. Abeta42 also induces tissue oxidation (DNA/RNA, proteins, and lipids) through trace metals (Cu, Zn, and Fe), which can be protected by antioxidant enzymes, vitamin C, and vitamin E. Superoxide dismutase catalyzes the conversion of toxic superoxide radical to less reactive hydrogen peroxide, contributing to protection from AD. Here we review the involvement of oxidative stress in AD progression induced from an imbalance between the radical formation of Abeta42 itself together with unique turn structure at positions Glu22 and Asp23 and several defense systems.
