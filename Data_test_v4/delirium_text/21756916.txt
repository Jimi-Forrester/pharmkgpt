21756916|a|The parvulin-type peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerases (PPIases) have been shown to be involved in tumor progression and the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease and were therefore a subject of intense research. Here, we describe a role for parvulin 17 in microtubule assembly. Co-precipitation experiments and sedimentation assays demonstrated that parvulin 17 interacts with tubulin in a GTP-dependent manner and thereby promotes the formation of microtubules, as shown by transmission electron microscopy and a microtubule polymerization assay. The microtubule-assembly-promoting properties of parvulin 17 seem to depend on its PPIase activity. Thus, catalytic deficient variants of parvulin 17 were not able to promote microtubule formation. Accordingly, inhibitors of parvulin 17 activity also prevent parvulin-catalyzed tubulin polymerization. The analysis of tubulin interaction sites on parvulin using peptide microarrays revealed that tubulin interacts with the substrate binding pocket of parvulin. Additionally, beta-tubulin peptide scan on microarrays demonstrates interaction of parvulin 17 with an Arg-Pro-Asp motif corresponding to proline residue 87 of beta-tubulin. Confocal laser scanning microscopy points to a function of parvulin 17 in microtubule dynamics as well. Parvulin 17 is predominantly found in the cytosol and colocalizes with microtubules.
