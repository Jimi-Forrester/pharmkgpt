34359358|t|Digital Biomarkers for Neuromuscular Disorders: A Systematic Scoping Review.
34359358|a|Biomarkers play a vital role in clinical care. They enable early diagnosis and treatment by identifying a patient's condition and disease course and act as an outcome measure that accurately evaluates the efficacy of a new treatment or drug. Due to the rapid development of digital technologies, digital biomarkers are expected to grow tremendously. In the era of change, this scoping review was conducted to see which digital biomarkers are progressing in neuromuscular disorders, a diverse and broad-range disease group among the neurological diseases, to discover available evidence for their feasibility and reliability. Thus, a total of 10 studies were examined: 9 observational studies and 1 animal study. Of the observational studies, studies were conducted with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) patients. Non-peer reviewed poster presentations were not considered, as the articles may lead to erroneous results. The only animal study included in the present review investigated the mice model of ALS for detecting rest disturbances using a non-invasive digital biomarker.
