33281712|t|Characteristics of Sleep Structure Assessed by Objective Measurements in Patients With Amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment: A Meta-Analysis.
33281712|a|Objectives: This study aims to explore the differences of sleep structure between patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and elderly people with normal cognition, which will help to provide evidence for the relationship between sleep disturbances and cognitive impairment. Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted on the literature on sleep parameters obtained by polysomnography or actigraphy in patients with aMCI. The PubMed and EMBASE databases were searched up to April 2020. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were established according to evidence-based medicine methods, and data of all eligible studies were meta-analyzed using the Review Manager 5.3 software. Results: Among the 1,171 literature articles on sleep structure of patients with MCI, eight case-control studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in this meta-analysis. A total of 278 subjects were included, of which 103 were patients with aMCI and 175 were elderly people with normal cognition. The results showed that sleep efficiency (SE) and slow wave sleep (SWS) of patients with aMCI were significantly lower than those of healthy elderly people. Compared with the control group, the percentage of stage 1 of non-rapid eye movement (N1%) in the aMCI patients group increased, and the percentage of stage 2 of non-rapid eye movement (N2%) decreased. Conclusions: Patients with aMCI may experience more severe sleep disturbances than normal cognitive elderly people. There were specific changes, especially in SE and SWS, in the sleep structure of patients with aMCI when compared to those with normal cognition.
