29156482|t|[How to Reduce the Rate of Postoperative Complications in Frail Patients?]
29156482|a|Frail patients are more prone to develop complications during and after surgery. As the syndrome becomes more common, recognition and special management of frail patients in the perioperative setting is becoming crucial to improve short- and long-term outcomes. Based on current literature and guidelines, we present a compilation of strategies that could be employed to reduce postoperative complication rates in frail patients. Due to their impaired response to stressors, potential perioperative hazards to frail patients are identified and discussed. This includes the risk of dehydration, hypothermia, cardiovascular decompensation, unusual drug reactions, and delirium. The benefits of early mobilization and nutritional support are also discussed. If frailty is detected preoperatively, thus alerting the team about the increased risk of complications, strategies can be implemented in the perioperative setting to improve the chances of successful recovery.
