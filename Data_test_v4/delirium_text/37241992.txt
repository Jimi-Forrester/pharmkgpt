37241992|a|Biothiols such as cysteine, homocysteine, and glutathione play significant roles in important biological activities, and their abnormal concentrations have been found to be closely associated with certain diseases, making their detection a critical task. To this end, fluorescent probes have become increasingly popular due to their numerous advantages, including easy handling, desirable spatiotemporal resolution, high sensitivity, fast response, and favorable biocompatibility. As a result, intensive research has been conducted to create fluorescent probes for the detection and imaging of biothiols. This brief review summarizes recent advances in the field of biothiol-responsive fluorescent probes, with an emphasis on rational probe design, including the reaction mechanism, discriminating detection, reversible detection, and specific detection. Furthermore, the challenges and prospects of fluorescence probes for biothiols are also outlined.
