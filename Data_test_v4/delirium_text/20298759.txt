20298759|t|Dose-related effects of memantine on a mismatch negativity-like response in anesthetized rats.
20298759|a|Memantine is a low-affinity NMDA receptor antagonist that is used in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease to alleviate the cognitive symptoms of the disease. In humans, memantine has been shown to facilitate auditory change detection as reflected in the mismatch negativity (MMN) response recorded in the frontal cortex. In the present study we investigated the effects of memantine on the auditory MMN-like responses recorded in anesthetized rats. Saline, a low (3 mg/kg) or a high (10 mg/kg) dose of memantine was i.p. injected into the animals. Auditory MMN-like responses were recorded during the presentation of a repeated tone of one frequency (standard, P=0.956) that was rarely replaced by a tone of another frequency (deviant, P=0.044). The low dose of memantine did not observably affect the amplitude of the auditory MMN-like response, but it prolonged the duration of the response relative to saline. The high dose of memantine, in contrast, blocked the generation of the auditory MMN-like response. The findings suggest that memantine may, with appropriate doses, facilitate already this early stage of auditory processing.
