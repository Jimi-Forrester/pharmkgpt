34631207|a|Poland is among the European countries currently facing the second wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. A lot of studies confirm the mortality rate of COVID-19 increases with age. Considering the particularly adverse outcomes of a SARS-CoV-2 infection, preventing infections should be the priority for public health professionals. One method for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infections among eldery people may involve implementing procedures for limiting the spread of the pathogen, and providing education to medical staff, so as to bridge any gaps in knowledge on virus spread and post-infection or post-exposure management. Three residential medical centers in Poland were selected for evaluation of existing medical procedures to identify any errors in the current procedures applied for the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 spread in the facility. The project involved 4 steps: (1) Audit of the existing medical procedures; (2) Knowledge evaluation for the staff (n=185) in the senior- and disabled care facilities, administration of a knowledge test developed by the authors to assess knowledge on SARS-CoV-2 prevention; (3) Training for medical staff; (4) Updates and implementation of procedures. The knowledge test conducted revealed a lack of knowledge of medical personnel about SARS-CoV-2. The deficiencies of the surveyed group varied depending on the place of employment. Almost half of the surveyed medical centers (center No. 1 (52%) vs. center No. 2 (44%) vs. center No. 3(59%)) believed that elderly people usually do not show symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the facility No. 1, 70% of respondents did know that SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted via the alimentary route compared to center No. 2 and No. 3 where knowledge about it showed only 28,9% and 24,8% responders, respectively. Also, in facility No. 1, the least among the studied group (67%) knew that people with comorbidities were at risk of covid-19 compared to respondents from facility No. 2 and 3, where, respectively, 100% and 93% had such knowledge. Only 33.3% of the staff of facility No. 1 knew how to deal with a patient who will present symptoms such as temp >38 degrees with coughing or dyspnea while in institution No. 2 and 3, this knowledge was slightly higher at 44% and 60% respectively. The audit of the existing hygiene procedures used to limit the risk of SARS-CoV-2 spread demonstrated a number of shortcomings. Employees at the residential medical care centers included in the study had gaps in knowledge on the spread of SARS-CoV-2. The training sessions implemented at the next stage improved knowledge on SARS-CoV-2 infections. Additionally, decisions were made to modify certain procedures and introduce new ones to better prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
