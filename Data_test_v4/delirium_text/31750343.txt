31750343|t|Multidisciplinary treatment of a patient with necrotizing fasciitis caused by Staphylococcus aureus: A case report.
31750343|a|BACKGROUND: Necrotizing fasciitis is a severe bacterial skin infection that spreads quickly and is characterized by extensive necrosis of the deep and superficial fascia resulting in the devascularization and necrosis of associated tissues. Because of high morbidity and mortality, accurate diagnosis and early treatment with adequate antibiotics and surgical intervention are vital. And timely identification and treatment of complications are necessary to improve survival of patient. CASE SUMMARY: We report a case of necrotizing fasciitis caused by Staphylococcus aureus in a patient using high doses of glucocorticoid and suffering from secondary diabetes mellitus. He was admitted to our hospital due to redness and oedema of the lower limbs. After admission, necrotizing fasciitis caused by Staphylococcus aureus was considered, and he was discharged after B-ultrasound drainage and multiple surgical operations. In the process of treatment, multiple organ functions were damaged, but with the help of multi-disciplinary treatment, the patient got better finally. CONCLUSION: The key to successful management of necrotizing fasciitis is an early and accurate diagnosis. The method of using vacuum sealing drainage in postoperative patients can keep the wound dry and clean, reduce infection rate, and promote wound healing. Interdisciplinary collaboration is a vital prerequisite for successful treatment.
