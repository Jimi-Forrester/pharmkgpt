37575753|t|Psychosis as a Manifestation of Focal Impaired Awareness Seizure in a Geriatric Patient.
37575753|a|Focal impaired awareness seizures (FIAS), previously known as complex partial seizures, refer to focal seizures that start in one hemisphere of the brain and are associated with an impairment in consciousness. FIAS of temporal lobe origin most often present with psychopathology, such as behavioral and affective symptoms. It has a bimodal age distribution peaking at the extremes of life. Geriatric presentations can often be subtle and go unnoticed asides from a few symptoms, such as confusion and memory lapses. Here, we present a unique case of a geriatric patient with FIAS presenting as transient psychosis.
