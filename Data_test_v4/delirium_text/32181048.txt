32181048|t|The Impact of Music and Noise-Cancellation on Sedation Requirements During Total Knee Replacement: A Randomized Controlled Trial.
32181048|a|BACKGROUND: Music has emerged as a well-received medical intervention. Patients may be uncomfortable during total joint replacement, which can result in high sedation requirements. These requirements place elderly patients at risk for delirium. This study compares the effect of noise-cancellation versus music medicine on sedation requirements, pain, and opioid consumption during elective total knee replacement. METHODS: This prospective, double-blinded, randomized clinical trial was conducted at Virginia Commonwealth University Medical Center between July 2018 and July 2019. All participants underwent primary total knee arthroplasty with a combined spinal-epidural as their primary anesthetic and received noise-cancelling, wireless headphones. Patients in the control group received the noise-cancellation feature only, while patients in the experimental group were permitted to listen to music of their choice. Patients signaled a request for sedation by squeezing a noise-making rubber hippopotamus toy. The primary outcomes included whether sedation was requested by the participant, the number of sedation demand doses requested, and the amount of propofol sedation administered during the procedure. Secondary outcomes included postoperative pain scores, total opioid consumption, and time to first opioid request. RESULTS: Seventy-one percent (n = 36) of patients agreed to participate in the study. Forty-four percent of participants in the noise-cancellation group and 19% of participants in the music group requested sedation (P = .25). The median propofol consumption was not different between groups (0 [0-6.7] microg/kg/min vs 0 [0-0] microg/kg/min, P = .101 for noise cancellation vs music, respectively). Pain scores and opioid consumption were not different between groups. DISCUSSION: To date, this is the first study to use Bluetooth communication, noise-cancellation, and an Internet-based music streaming service to determine whether this technology has an impact on outcomes during major orthopedic surgery. CONCLUSION: As an isolated intervention, the benefits of music in a complex operating room environment may be overstated. However, music integration with noise-reduction technology and patient-controlled sedation may lead to a safer and more satisfying anesthetic. More research is needed to determine the nonpharmacologic interventions that will produce positive outcomes for the geriatric population.
