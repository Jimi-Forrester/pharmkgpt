11511401|a|Transgenic Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans strains have been engineered to express human proteins associated with neurodegenerative diseases. These model systems include transgenic animals expressing beta-amyloid peptide (Alzheimer's disease), polyglutamine repeat proteins (Huntington's disease, Spinocerebellar ataxia), and alpha-synuclein (Parkinson's disease). In most of these invertebrate models, some aspects of the human diseases are reproduced. Although expression of all these proteins in transgenic mice has been instructive, the invertebrate models offer experimental advantages (e.g. forward genetic screens) that can potentially address some of the outstanding questions regarding the cellular processes underlying these diseases. This review considers what has been learned from these invertebrate models, and speculates what further insight may be gained from them.
