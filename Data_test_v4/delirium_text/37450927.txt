37450927|t|Astrocyte-Microglia Crosstalk: A Novel Target for the Treatment of Migraine.
37450927|a|Migraine is a pervasive neurologic disease closely related to neurogenic inflammation. The astrocytes and microglia in the central nervous system are vital in inducing neurogenic inflammation in migraine. Recently, it has been found that there may be a crosstalk phenomenon between microglia and astrocytes, which plays a crucial part in the pathology and treatment of Alzheimer's disease and other central nervous system diseases closely related to inflammation, thus becoming a novel hotspot in neuroimmune research. However, the role of the crosstalk between microglia and astrocytes in the pathogenesis and treatment of migraine is yet to be discussed. Based on the preliminary literature reports, we have reviewed relevant evidence of the crosstalk between microglia and astrocytes in the pathogenesis of migraine and summarized the crosstalk pathways, thereby hoping to provide novel ideas for future research and treatment.
