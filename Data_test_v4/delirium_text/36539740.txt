36539740|t|The pathogenesis and treatment of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome after neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder: a case report and literature review.
36539740|a|BACKGROUND: Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is a rare disease characterized by reversible subcortical vasogenic brain edema. Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) is a frequent neurological autoimmune disease that is rarely reported to complicate PRES. CASE PRESENTATION: Here, we report a case of neuromyelitis optica (NMO) concurrent with PRES. A 50-year-old woman presented with severe impairment of her health visual acuity, with significantly worsening of the motor weakness in both lower limbs during methylprednisolone therapy after her diagnosis of NMO. MRI showed new-onset brain edematous lesions of the bilateral frontal, occipital, and parietal lobes. PRES was considered. Her vision impairment and weakness of the extremities were alleviated after antihypertensive treatment and dehydration. The edema lesions detected by MRI also completely disappeared. CONCLUSIONS: We reviewed 14 cases of NMO with PRES and concluded that the etiology of NMOSD concurrent PRES may be multifactorial, involving pathogenic IgGs against aquaporin-4 (AQP-4) and immunotherapy treatment. Different underlying pathogeneses require different treatment approaches.
