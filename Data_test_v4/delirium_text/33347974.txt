33347974|a|Neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Lewy body diseases (LBD), and the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia (ALS-FTD) spectrum are defined by the accumulation of specific misfolded protein aggregates. However, the mechanisms by which each proteinopathy leads to neurodegeneration remain elusive. We hypothesized that there is a common "pan-neurodegenerative" gene expression signature driving pathophysiology across these clinically and pathologically diverse proteinopathies. To test this hypothesis, we performed a systematic review of human CNS transcriptomics datasets from AD, LBD, and ALS-FTD patients and age-matched controls in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and ArrayExpress databases, followed by consistent processing of each dataset, meta-analysis, pathway enrichment, and overlap analyses. After applying pre-specified eligibility criteria and stringent data pre-processing, a total of 2600 samples from 26 AD, 21 LBD, and 13 ALS-FTD datasets were included in the meta-analysis. The pan-neurodegenerative gene signature is characterized by an upregulation of innate immunity, cytoskeleton, and transcription and RNA processing genes, and a downregulation of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. Pathway enrichment analyses also revealed the upregulation of neuroinflammation (including Toll-like receptor, TNF, and NFkappaB signaling) and phagocytosis, and the downregulation of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, lysosomal acidification, and ubiquitin-proteasome pathways. Our findings suggest that neuroinflammation and a failure in both neuronal energy metabolism and protein degradation systems are consistent features underlying neurodegenerative diseases, despite differences in the extent of neuronal loss and brain regions involved.
