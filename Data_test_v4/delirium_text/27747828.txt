27747828|t|Differences in Benzodiazepine Receptor Agonist Use in Rural and Urban Older Adults.
27747828|a|BACKGROUND: Older adults are especially susceptible to adverse consequences of potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs), such as benzodiazepine receptor agonists (BZDRAs), due to age-related pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic changes. Although some risk factors for BZDRA use in older adults have been identified, the role of rural versus urban residence is less clear. OBJECTIVE: To describe BZDRA use in rural versus urban older adults using pharmaceutical claims from Pennsylvania's Pharmaceutical Assistance Contract for the Elderly (PACE) program. METHODS: The sample consisted of older adults enrolled in Pennsylvania's Healthy Steps for Older Adults and participated in Pennsylvania's PACE program. Independent sample t tests and contingency tables were used to examine residence differences. Multivariate binary logistic modeling was performed. RESULTS: The total sample (N = 426) was 305 (71.6 %) urban-dwelling adults and 121 (28.4 %) rural-dwelling adults. Rural participants were more likely to be male, white, married, and have less than a high school education compared with urban participants (p <.01). Specifically, 25 % of rural-dwelling adults received a BZDRA compared with 15 % of urban-dwelling adults (p = 0.02). Three variables reached statistical significance for predicting BZDRA use in a multivariate model: rural residence (OR 2.58, 95 % CI 1.39-4.79), history of anxiety/depression (OR 4.20, 95 % CI 2.39-7.46), and number of medications (OR 1.11, 95 % CI 1.02-1.21). CONCLUSIONS: BZDRA prescription differences in older, rural-dwelling adults further highlights the need for geriatric and mental health specialists to provide specialized care to this population. Rural healthcare professionals may be less aware of PIMs for older adults, and initiatives to support geriatric services and provide education for existing providers may be beneficial.
