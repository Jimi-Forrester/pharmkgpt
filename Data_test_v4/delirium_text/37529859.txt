37529859|a|OBJECTIVE: To assess the nutritional status and depression of the elderly forcibly displaced Myanmar nationals (FDMNs) in Bangladesh and determine the associated factors of geriatric depression (GD). DESIGN: This was a community-based, cross-sectional study among elderly FDMNs. The Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA@-SF) and Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15 SF) were used to determine malnutrition and GD, respectively. SETTING: The study was conducted between November 2021 and March 2022 in Kutupalong Refugee Camp, Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh. PARTICIPANTS: The study participants were elderly FDMN aged >=60 years old (n = 430). RESULTS: The mean age and BMI were 71.7(+-7.8) years and 21.94(+-2.6) kg/m2 respectively. There was a high prevalence of self-reported diabetes mellitus (32.1%), hypertension (26.7%), hypotension (20%), skin diseases (28.4%), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (16.5%). The prevalence of malnutrition was 25.3%, and another 29.1% were at risk. The prevalence of GD was 57.9%, and co-occurrences of GD and malnutrition were seen in 17.5% of participants. GD was significantly higher among elderly people with malnutrition (AOR=1.71, 95%CI:1.01-2.89). FDMN aged >=80 years were at higher risk of GD (AOR=1.84, 95%CI:1.01-3.37) and having fewer than five members in the household was an independent predictor of GD. Diabetes mellitus (AOR=1.95, 95%CI:1.24-3.08) and hypotension (AOR=2.17, 95%CI:1.25-2.78) were also significantly associated with an increased risk of GD. CONCLUSION: A high prevalence of GD and malnutrition was observed among elderly FDMN in Bangladesh. The agencies working in Cox's Bazar should focus on geriatric malnutrition and GD for the improvement of the health situation of FDMN in Bangladesh.
