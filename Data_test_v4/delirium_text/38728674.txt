38728674|a|Objective: To examine the complexities of psychotropic medication prescription in home-based palliative care for oncology patients. Methods: A retrospective analysis of 125 medical records of patients receiving palliative home care for cancer was conducted at a tertiary hospital, with a specific focus on the prescription patterns of psychotropic medications. The data were collected in September 2023. Results: Among 125 cases, the mean age was 64.4 +- 14.9 years, with 50.4% females. Breast cancer (14.4%) and lung cancer (13.6%) were the most common diagnoses. Psychotropic medication was administered to 35.2% of patients. Treatment was initiated by palliative care doctors in 75% of cases, while psychiatrists handled 25%. Medication selection was predominantly symptom driven (63%), with anxiety prompting benzodiazepine prescriptions in 50% of cases, depression resulting in antidepressant use in 22%, and psychosis leading to antipsychotic treatment in 18%. Specific diagnoses were the target in only 36% of prescriptions, with delirium (27%) being the most prevalent, followed by depression and bipolar disorder. Benzodiazepines were the most commonly prescribed class of medications (56.8%), with clonazepam being the most prevalent (40.9%), followed by alprazolam and lorazepam (15.9%). Atypical antipsychotics made up 43.1% of prescriptions, with quetiapine being the most frequently prescribed (34%), along with olanzapine and risperidone (11%). Antidepressants accounted for 31.8% of prescriptions, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors at 18% and mirtazapine and amitriptyline at 6% each. Haloperidol, a typical antipsychotic, was prescribed in 13.6% of cases. Polypharmacy was observed in 35.6% of patients. Conclusion: In palliative home care, psychotropic medications are frequently prescribed by palliative doctors primarily for symptom management, with limited psychiatric consultations and challenges in accessing psychological evaluations. Collaborative efforts among regional or institutional medical bodies, including psychiatrists, psychologists, palliative doctors, and social workers, are needed to establish ethical guidelines for appropriate and effective psychotropic prescription.
