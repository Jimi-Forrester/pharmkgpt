34354558|a|Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is a risk factor for cognitive and memory dysfunction; however, the mechanism remains unclear. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was reported to have a positive effect on cognition and emotion regulation, but the study of its precursor, proBDNF, has been limited. This study aimed to elucidate the effects and associated mechanisms of hippocampal proBDNF in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced SAE mouse model. In this study, we found that the mice exhibited cognitive dysfunction on day 7 after LPS injection. The expression of proBDNF and its receptor, p75 NTR , was also increased in the hippocampus, while the levels of BDNF and its receptor, TrkB, were decreased. A co-localization study showed that proBDNF and p75 NTR were mainly co-localized with neurons. Furthermore, LPS treatment reduced the expression of NeuN, Nissl bodies, GluR4, NR1, NR2A, and NR2B in the hippocampus of SAE mice. Furthermore, an intrahippocampal or intraperitoneal injection of anti-proBDNF antibody was able to ameliorate LPS-induced cognitive dysfunction and restore the expression of NeuN, Nissl bodies, GluR4, NR1, NR2A, NR2B, and PSD95. These results indicated that treatment with brain delivery by an intrahippocampal and systemic injection of mAb-proBDNF may represent a potential therapeutic strategy for treating patients with SAE.
