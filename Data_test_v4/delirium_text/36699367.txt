36699367|a|Summary: The 10 known BRICHOS domain-containing proteins in humans have been linked to an unusually long list of pathologies, including cancer, obesity and two amyloid-like diseases. BRICHOS domains themselves have been described as intramolecular chaperones that act to prevent amyloid-like aggregation of their proteins' mature polypeptides. Using structural comparison of coevolution-based AlphaFold models and sequence conservation, we identified the Out at First (OAF) protein as a new member of the BRICHOS family in humans. OAF is an experimentally uncharacterized protein that has been proposed as a candidate biomarker for clinical management of coronavirus disease 2019 infections. Our analysis revealed how structural comparison of AlphaFold models can discover remote homology relationships and lead to a better understanding of BRICHOS domain molecular mechanism.
