37918760|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia, characterized by the presence of plaques of amyloid beta and Tau proteins. There is currently no permanent cure for AD; the only medications approved by the FDA for mild to moderate AD are cholinesterase inhibitors, NMDA receptor antagonists, and immunotherapies against core pathophysiology, that provide temporary relief only. Researchers worldwide have made significant attempts to find new targets and develop innovative therapeutic molecules to treat AD. The FDA-approved drugs are palliative and couldn't restore the damaged neuron cells of AD. Stem cells have self-differentiation properties, making them prospective therapeutics to treat AD. The promising results in pre-clinical studies of stem cell therapy for AD seek attention worldwide. Various stem cells, mainly mesenchymal stem cells, are currently in different phases of clinical trials and need more advancements to take this therapy to the translational level. Here, we review research from the past decade that has identified several hypotheses related to AD pathology. Moreover, this article also focuses on the recent advancement in therapeutic strategies for AD treatment including immunotherapy and stem cell therapy detailing the clinical trials that are currently undergoing development.
