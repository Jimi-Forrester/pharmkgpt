21073430|a|Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia. Alzheimer's disease will be responsible for an enormous burden on the individual and the society, as with the aging of the population, the incidence and the prevalence will grow. Presently, the drugs used in Alzheimer's disease are only effective symptomatically and improve functioning. They do not halt the progression of the disease. With the recent advances in our understanding of the pathogenesis of this disease, there have been tremendous advances in the clinical trials of compounds that can modify the disease process. Numerous therapeutic interventions and neuroprotective approaches are also in trial phase. It seems that in near future some of these compounds may be found effective and safe for use in this disease there by reducing the incidence of this disease in years to come, thereby lessen the burden due to it. In this article various compounds that can modify the course of the disease are discussed. Some recent patents and inventions for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease have also been discussed.
