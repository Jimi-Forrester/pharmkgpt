15750052|t|Discretionary hospitalization of nursing home residents with and without Alzheimer's disease: a multilevel analysis.
15750052|a|UNLABELLED: This study analyzes facility variations in hospital admission rates of nursing home (NH) residents with and without Alzheimer's disease (AD) or related dementia with the aim of better understanding how facility-level contextual factors differentially affect hospitalization risks. METHOD: The sample population consists of 19,217 and 18,399 Medicaid residents with and without AD, respectively, from 546 NHs in Massachusetts between 1991 and 1993. Hospital use is measured as annual nonpsychiatric discretionary hospital admissions to short-term general hospitals. Multilevel estimation methods are used to obtain facility and market area parameter estimates. RESULTS: There was greater interfacility variation in discretionary hospital admission rates of AD residents than residents without AD, particularly among more vulnerable subgroups of AD residents. DISCUSSION: The findings underscore the importance of licensed nursing personnel in reducing discretionary hospitalizations among NH residents with AD.
