34545028|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Postoperative neurocognitive disorders (NCD) are significant causes of morbidity and mortality. In this paper, we will review our understanding and potential management of postoperative NCD. RECENT FINDINGS: Postoperative delirium, delayed neurocognitive recovery and postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) are recognized as a part of the continuous spectrum of postoperative NCD. Although the pathophysiology is still poorly understood, there is renewed focus on improving neurocognitive outcomes of aging surgical population. Novel methods of neurocognitive screening are developed and research in the prevention and management of NCD has gained traction. SUMMARY: A spectrum of NCD exists in surgical patients ranging from postoperative delirium, delayed neurocognitive recovery, and POCD. Identification of patients at-risk for developing NCD can help target appropriate perioperative intervention. Also, specialized care teams and the implementation of standardized protocols are crucial for the successful management perioperative NCD. Finally, large, randomized, multicenter studies are needed to confirm benefits of preventive and treatment strategies.
