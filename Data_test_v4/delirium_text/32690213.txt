32690213|a|BACKGROUND: Falls are the leading cause of injury-related emergency presentations, hospital admissions and deaths in Victorians over the age of 65. While there is extensive literature analysing traumatic injuries resulting from falls in older patients, there is little data on ocular injuries in this patient group. METHODOLOGY: A retrospective audit of all patients over 65 years referred to the Ophthalmology Department of a tertiary hospital following fall from standing height between January 2009 and December 2018 to determine the demographics, injury setting, ophthalmic injuries, interventions and outcomes of ocular trauma secondary to falls. RESULTS: Two hundred and seventy patients (F = 155, M = 115) were included, with a mean age of 81 years. 180 falls (66.7%) occurred in a residential environment. The most common reason for referral was orbital fracture (n = 155). Severe ocular injuries included globe rupture (n = 23), retro-bulbar haematoma (n = 22), retinal detachment (n = 6) and traumatic optic neuropathy (n = 6). Forty patients (14.8%) presented with a visual acuity (VA) below 6/60 while 34 patients (12.5%) had a non-assessable VA secondary to delirium or intubation. Of these 34, 9 had a significant ocular injury. A total of 28 patients (10.4%) were permanently blinded by their injuries. Twenty-three patients (8.5%) required admission to ICU and 16 patients (5.93%) died during their in-hospital stay. Thirty-six injuries were referred beyond the 24-hour mark, including a globe rupture and a case of traumatic optic neuropathy. With the exception of the missed globe rupture, all other injuries requiring emergency surgery were operated on within 24 h. CONCLUSION: Falls in older people may be associated with sight-threatening ocular injuries which are common and easy to miss in this population demographic. The presence of ocular injuries in this patient group is associated with significant rates of in-hospital mortality and poor functional outcomes. It is therefore essential for trauma practitioners to perform a detailed and systematic assessment in order to identify sight-threatening ocular injuries and allow for expedient sight-saving intervention to be performed.
