16394556|a|The purpose of this work was to develop biodegradable microspheres for long term delivery of a potent acetyl cholinesterase inhibitor, huperzine A (Hup-A), which is of interest in the palliative treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Microspheres were successfully prepared with specifically end-group uncapped poly(d,l-lactide acid) and poly(d,l-lactide-co-glycolide acid) using a simple o/w solvent evaporation method. The morphology, particle size and size distribution, drug loading capacity, drug entrapment efficiency (EE) and in vitro drug release were studied in detail. It was found that the terminal group and the inherent viscosity (IV) of the polymers played key role in the drug encapsulation: higher EE was achieved with end-group uncapped and low IV polymers. In vitro drug release from microspheres made from the selected three kinds of polymers revealed sustained release of Hup-A without significant burst release. Preliminary pharmacokinetic study following subcutaneous injection of Hup-A loaded microspheres illustrated the sustained release of the drug over 6-8 weeks at clinically relevant doses in vivo. The studies demonstrated the feasibility of long term delivery of Hup-A using biodegradable microspheres.
