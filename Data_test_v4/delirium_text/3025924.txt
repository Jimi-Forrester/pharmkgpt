3025924|a|The intracellular effects of a number of hormonal signals are mediated by the cyclic AMP second messenger system in man and the ubiquitous distribution of hormone-stimulated adenylate cyclase suggests the importance of this enzyme complex in normal aging and pathophysiological states. Various vectors including heredity, endogenous catecholamines, steroid hormones, and drugs affect the activity of hormone-stimulated adenylate cyclase in man. The effect of heredity was studied using lymphocytes obtained from monozygotic twin pairs and age and sex-matched sib pairs. Only for forskolin-stimulated activity is a significant proportion of individual variance attributable to heredity, suggesting the relative stability of the catalytic subunit. Beta-adrenergic and prostaglandin E-1 activity are "state" characteristics and their activities are controlled by environmental parameters. A significant reduction in isoproterenol-stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation between the menses and luteal phase of the menstrual cycle is observed in lymphocytes obtained from 11 female subjects. The lowest level of beta-adrenergic receptor activity is associated with the highest levels of progesterone and estradiol hormone levels in blood. Lithium at therapeutic concentrations markedly inhibits adenylate cyclase activity in platelet membranes. Moreover, marked individual differences are observed in sensitivity to lithium as determined by Dixon plot derived Ki values for 9 normal, healthy subjects. Human adenylate cyclase obtained from platelets and lymphocytes is activated by micromolar amounts of aluminum in the presence of NaF. Irreversible activation of adenylate cyclase by aluminum is suggested as a possible mechanism of this metal's neurotoxicity. The biochemical basis for the age-associated decline in beta-adrenergic responsiveness in man is discussed. Several investigations suggest a deficit at two levels in the adenylate cyclase complex: an impaired coupling of the receptor/N protein subunits and an additional lesion distal to the receptor at the level of N/C coupling. Perfusion studies with salbutamol suggest that the decline in beta-adrenergic sensitivity is general and not restricted to lymphocytes. Possible abnormalities in cyclic AMP signal amplification and recognition in various disease states is discussed. Increased prostaglandin E-1-stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation is observed in lymphocytes obtained from patients with Alzheimer's disease compared to age-matched controls and correlated with severity of the disease state.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
