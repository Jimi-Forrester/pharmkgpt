36164880|t|[Mechanism of Atractylodes macrocephala against Alzheimer's disease via regulating lysophagy based on LKB1-AMPK-TFEB pathway].
36164880|a|Myloid beta(Abeta) is produced by cleavage of amyloid precursor protein(APP), which is a main reason for Alzheimer's disease(AD) occurrence and development. This study preliminarily investigated the mechanism of Atractylodes macrocephala(AM) against AD based on LKB1-AMPK-TFEB pathway. The effect of AM on memory ability of AD transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans CL2241 was detected, and then the APP plasmid was transiently transferred to mouse neuroblastoma(N2 a) cells in vitro. The mice were divided into the blank control group, APP group(model group), positive control group(100 mumol L~(-1) rapamycin), and AM low-, medium-and high-dose groups(100, 200 and 300 mug mL~(-1)). The content of Abeta_(1-42) in cell medium, the protein level of APP, the fluorescence intensity of APP, the transcriptional activity of transcription factor EB(TFEB), the activity of lysosomes in autophagy, and autophagy flux were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay(ELISA), Western blot, fluorescence microscope, luciferase reporter gene assay, RLuc-LC3 wt/RLuc-LC3 G120 A, and mRFP-GFP-LC3, respectively. The protein expression of TFEB, LC3II, LC3I, LAMP2, Beclin1, LKB1, p-AMPK and p-ACC was detected by Western blot. Immunofluorescence and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction(RT-PCR) were used to detect the fluorescence intensity of TFEB and the mRNA expression of TFEB and downstream target genes, respectively. The results showed that AM reduced the chemotactic index of transgenic C. elegans CL2241, and decreased the content of Abeta in the supernatant of cell culture medium at different concentrations. In addition, AM lowered the protein level of APP and the fluorescence intensity of APP in a dose-dependent manner. Transcriptional activity of TFEB and fluorescence intensity of mRFP-GFP-LC3 plasmid were enhanced after AM treatment, and the value of RLuc-LC3 wt/RLuc-LC3 G120 A was reduced. AM promoted the protein levels of TFEB, LAMP2 and Beclin1 at different concentrations, and increased the protein expression ratio of LC3II/LC3I in a dose-dependent manner. Immunofluorescence results revealed that AM improved the fluorescence intensity and nuclear expression of TFEB, and RT-PCR results indicated that AM of various concentrations elevated the mRNA expression of TFEB in APP transfected N2 a cells and promoted the transcription level of LAMP2 in a dose-dependent manner, and high-concentration AM also increased the mRNA levels of LC3 and P62. The protein levels of LKB1, p-AMPK and p-ACC were elevated by AM of different concentrations. In summary, AM regulating lysophagy and degrading APP are related to the activation of LKB1-AMPK-TFEB pathway.
