Recent studies suggested that Rhodiola crenulata extract (RCE) has cognitive protective effects in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). PURPOSE: To assess the protective effects of RCE on cognitive deficits and clarify its therapeutic mechanisms in Abeta1-42 -induced rat models of AD. STUDY DESIGN: RCE was prepared by freeze-drying technology. Their protective effects on Abeta1-42-induced rat models of AD and the preliminary therapeutic mechanisms were studied. METHODS: The Y maze test and Morris water maze (MWM) test were conducted to evaluate the learning and memory abilities of the rats. Subsequently, biochemical assays, hematoxylin-eosin staining, immunohistochemistry and Western blotting were performed to elucidate the mechanisms. RESULTS: RCE significantly increased the spontaneous alternation (F (6, 111) = 8.165, p < 0.001), prolonged the swimming time (F (6, 111) = 20.143, p < 0.001) and decreased the escape latency in rat models of AD. In addition, RCE significantly increased the acetylcholine (Ach) level and the choline acetyl transferase (ChAT) activity (F (6, 34) = 6.033, p < 0.001; F (6, 34) = 6.958, p < 0.001, respectively), repaired the damage of hippocampus neurons and prevented Abeta formation in the hippocampus in Abeta1-42 injected rats. Moreover, RCE increased the superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and decreased the malondialdehyde (MDA) level in cortex of Abeta1-42 injected rats (F (6, 34) = 5.097, p < 0.01; F (6, 34) = 2.907, p < 0.05, respectively), significantly reduced the expressions of p-tau (ser396) and induced the expressions of p-GSK3beta (ser9) in hippocampus (F (6, 34) = 15.297, p < 0.001; F (6, 34) = 9.652, p < 0.001, respectively). CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrated that RCE significantly alleviated the learning and memory deficits in the Abeta1-42-induced rat models of AD. The mechanisms involved its protection effects against cholinergic system deficiency, oxidative stress damage and GSK3beta activation. RCE may be a potential therapeutic medicine with multi-targets to prevent the progression of cognitive deterioration in AD.
