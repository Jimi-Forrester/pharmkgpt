38370359|t|VGLUT2 and APP family: unraveling the neurobiochemical mechanisms of neurostimulation therapy to STZ-induced diabetes and neuropathy.
38370359|a|Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy (DPN) poses an escalating threat to public health, profoundly impacting well-being and quality of life. Despite its rising prevalence, the pathogenesis of DPN remains enigmatic, and existing clinical interventions fall short of achieving meaningful reversals of the condition. Notably, neurostimulation techniques have shown promising efficacy in alleviating DPN symptoms, underscoring the imperative to elucidate the neurobiochemical mechanisms underlying DPN. This study employs an integrated multi-omics approach to explore DPN and its response to neurostimulation therapy. Our investigation unveiled a distinctive pattern of vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGLUT2) expression in DPN, rigorously confirmed through qPCR and Western blot analyses in DPN C57 mouse model induced by intraperitoneal Streptozotocin (STZ) injection. Additionally, combining microarray and qPCR methodologies, we revealed and substantiated variations in the expression of the Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) family in STZ-induced DPN mice. Analyzing the transcriptomic dataset generated from neurostimulation therapy for DPN, we intricately explored the differential expression patterns of VGLUT2 and APPs. Through correlation analysis, protein-protein interaction predictions, and functional enrichment analyses, we predicted the key biological processes involving VGLUT2 and the APP family in the pathogenesis of DPN and during neurostimulation therapy. This comprehensive study not only advances our understanding of the pathogenesis of DPN but also provides a theoretical foundation for innovative strategies in neurostimulation therapy for DPN. The integration of multi-omics data facilitates a holistic view of the molecular intricacies of DPN, paving the way for more targeted and effective therapeutic interventions.
