38482617|a|The prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is increasing as the elderly population, which hurts elderly people's cognition and capacity for self-care. The process of mitophagy involves the selective clearance of ageing and impaired mitochondria, which is required to preserve intracellular homeostasis and energy metabolism. Currently, it has been discovered that mitophagy abnormalities are intimately linked to the beginning and progression of AD. This article discusses the mechanism of mitophagy, abnormal mitophagy, and therapeutic effects in AD. The purpose is to offer fresh perspectives on the causes and remedies of AD.
