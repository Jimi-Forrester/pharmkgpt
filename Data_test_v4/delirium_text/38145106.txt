38145106|t|RNA m6A methylation in psychiatric disorders.
38145106|a|This comprehensive review introduces the features of m6A modification and its role in neuropsychiatric disorders. The research findings suggest that m6A modifications and their regulators play a critical role in the occurrence and development of major psychiatric disorders, especially Alzheimer's disease, affecting synaptic protein synthesis, subtype classification, immune infiltration, pathogenesis, and inflammatory infiltration. These findings highlight m6A regulators as potential new diagnostic and therapeutic targets, with m6A methyltransferase METTL3 being the best-characterized regulator in these diseases. The review concludes that m6A modification is a promising target for the prevention and treatment of major psychiatric disorders.
