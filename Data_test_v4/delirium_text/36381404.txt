Two long-term, prospective, aging cohort studies, namely, Srinivaspura Aging, Neurosenescence and COGnition (SANSCOG) study and Tata Longitudinal Study of Aging (TLSA), conducted in rural and urban India, respectively, had to be suspended during first and second waves of COVID-19. Methods: We conducted telephonic assessments to screen for depression and anxiety in the above two cohorts comprising of adults >=45 years, during the first wave (2020) and second wave (2021) lockdown periods in India. Further, we included depression assessments data from two additional time periods-pre-COVID (2019) and the "inter-wave" period (between the first and second waves) to compare proportions of depression in these cohorts, during four distinct time periods-(i) pre-COVID, (ii) COVID first wave lockdown, (iii) inter-wave period, and (iv) COVID second wave lockdown (rural: 684, 733, 458, 611 and urban: 317, 297, 204, 305 respectively). Results: During COVID first wave, 28.8% and 5.5% had depression and anxiety, respectively in the rural cohort. Corresponding figures in the urban cohort were 6.5% and 1.7%. During second wave, 28.8% of rural subjects had depression and 3.9% had anxiety, whereas corresponding figures in urban subjects were 13.1% and 0.66%. During the above-mentioned four time periods, proportions of depression were: rural-8.3%, 28.8%, 16.6%, 28.8%; urban-12%, 6.1%, 8.8%, 13.1%. Conclusions: Multi-fold increase in depression among aging, rural Indians during first and second waves, with high depression among subjects >=65 years and those with comorbidities during the first wave, is concerning. Urgent public health measures are needed to address this added mental health burden and thereby, prevent further potential adverse consequences.
