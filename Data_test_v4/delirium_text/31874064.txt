31874064|t|Delirium in hospitalized older adults.
31874064|a|Delirium is a common and underdiagnosed problem in hospitalized older adults. It is associated with an increased risk of poor cognitive and functional outcomes, institutionalization, and death. Timely diagnosis of delirium and non-pharmacological prevention and management strategies can improve patient outcomes. The Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) is the most widely used clinical assessment tool for the diagnosis of delirium. Multiple variations of the CAM have been developed for ease of administration and for the unique needs of specific patient populations, including the 3-min diagnostic CAM (3D CAM), CAM-Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU), Delirium Triage Screen (DTS)/Brief CAM (b-CAM), 4AT tool, and ultrabrief delirium assessment. Strong evidence supports the effectiveness of nonpharmacologic strategies as the primary intervention for the prevention of delirium. Multicomponent delirium prevention strategies can reduce the incidence of delirium by 40%. Investigation of underlying medical precipitants and optimization of non-pharmacological interventions are first line in the management of delirium. Despite a lack of evidence supporting use of antipsychotics, low dose antipsychotics remain second line for off-label treatment of distressing psychoses and/or agitated behaviors that are refractory to non-pharmacological behavioral interventions and pose an imminent risk of harm to self or others. Any antipsychotic prescription for delirium should be accompanied by an appropriate taper plan. Follow up with primary care providers on discharge from hospital for ongoing screening of cognitive impairment is important.
