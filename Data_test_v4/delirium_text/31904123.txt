31904123|a|Genetic alteration of the sodium channel provides a remarkable opportunity to understand how epilepsy and its comorbidities arise from a molecular disease of excitable membranes, and a chance to create a better future for children with epileptic encephalopathy. In a single cell, the channel reliably acts as a voltage-sensitive switch, enabling axon impulse firing, whereas at a network level, it becomes a variable rheostat for regulating dynamic patterns of neuronal oscillations, including those underlying cognitive development, seizures, and even premature lethality. Despite steady progress linking genetic variation of the channels with distinctive clinical syndromes, our understanding of the intervening biologic complexity underlying each of them is only just beginning. More research on the functional contribution of individual channel subunits to specific brain networks and cellular plasticity in the developing brain is needed before we can reliably advance from precision diagnosis to precision treatment of inherited sodium channel disorders.
