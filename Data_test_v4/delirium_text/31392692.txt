31392692|t|In Vivo Two-Photon Imaging of Microglial Synapse Contacts.
31392692|a|Microglia are traditionally known as immune sentinels of the brain and as key player in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson disease, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Recently, they were also identified as synaptic organizer, promoting formation and maturation of synapses as well as modifying synaptic activity. Interestingly, microglia-mediated synaptic pruning and microglia-mediated changes in synaptic plasticity were observed both during brain development and in neurodegenerative diseases, stressing the key role of microglia-synapse interaction in these processes. Here we descried a technique for noninvasive in vivo monitoring of microglia-synapse interactions by means of two-photon microscopy.
