10495582|t|Potential cost savings in residential care for Alzheimer's disease patients.
10495582|a|Data from a 1996 cross-sectional study examining the costs of care for Alzheimer's Disease patients are used to estimate the potential cost savings that could result by substituting assisted living for nursing home care for AD residents with health profiles that appear to be manageable within assisted living facilities that specialize in dementia care. Results indicate that up to 13.9% of nursing home costs could be saved, making such a service substitution an attractive alternative in the provision of residential care for certain categories of AD patients.
