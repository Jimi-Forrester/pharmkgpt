39178013|t|Divergent Mortality Patterns Associated With Dementia in the United States: 1999-2020.
39178013|a|Objective: To analyze contemporary trends of dementia and dementia-related mortality in the United States between 1999 and 2020 categorized by demographic and regional attributes. Methods: A retrospective cohort analysis was conducted using mortality data from individuals aged 35 years to >=85 years, where dementia/Alzheimer disease was recorded as a contributing or underlying cause of death. Data were extracted from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Wide-Ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research database for the years 1999-2020. Mortality rates adjusted for age due to dementia (annual age-adjusted mortality rate [AAMR]) per 10,000 individuals in the United States were categorized by gender, racial and ethnic groups, and geographic regions. Results: Results revealed 6,601,680 deaths related to dementia between 1999 and 2020. Among these, 85.5% were non-Hispanic (NH) white, 8% NH black, 4.34% Hispanic or Latino, 1.6% NH Asian or Pacific Islander, and 0.3% NH American Indian or Alaska Native adults. The overall AAMR was 17.49, with women experiencing a higher AAMR of 18.19 compared to men (16.05). Ethnic disparities were evident, with NH black adults having the highest AAMR (18.23), followed by NH white (18.09) and Hispanic adults (12.7). Over the study period, the overall AAMR increased from 10.86 in 1999 to 21.42 in 2020, with a notable 18.4% rise in the AAMR from 1999 to 2001. From 2001 to 2020, the average percent change of the AAMR was 1.0%. This upward trend in mortality was observed for both men and women and across all ethnicities. Conclusions: The study spanning 1999-2020 revealed concerning trends in dementia-related mortality in the United States. There is a critical need for targeted health care policy initiatives aimed at mitigating the increasing dementia burden. Prim Care Companion CNS Disord 2024;26(4):24m03724.
