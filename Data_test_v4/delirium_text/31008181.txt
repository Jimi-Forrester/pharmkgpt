31008181|t|Left atrial appendage closure with WATCHMAN in Asian patients: 2 year outcomes from the WASP registry.
31008181|a|BACKGROUND: Left atrial appendage closure is a non-pharmacological alternative for stroke prevention in high-risk non-valvular atrial fibrillation patients, but has not been widely studied in Asian patients. The prospective WASP registry assessed real-world outcomes for patients undergoing WATCHMAN implant in the Asia-Pacific region. METHODS: Data were collected from consecutive patients across 9 centres. Major endpoints included procedural success, safety and long-term outcomes including occurrence of bleeding, stroke/transient ischaemic attack/systemic embolism and all-cause mortality. RESULTS: Subjects (n = 201) had a mean age of 70.8 +- 9.4 years, high stroke risk (CHA2DS2-VASc: 3.9 +- 1.7), elevated bleeding risk (HAS-BLED: 2.1 +- 1.2) with 53% patients from Asian countries. Successful implantation occurred in 98.5% of patients; 7-day device/procedure-related SAE rate was 3.0%. After 2 years of follow-up, the rates of ischaemic stroke/TIA/SE and major bleeding were 1.9 and 2.2 per 100-PY, respectively, representing relative reductions of 77% and 49% versus expected rates per risk scores. The relative risk reductions versus expected rates were more pronounced in Asians vs. Non-Asians (89% vs 62%; 77% vs 14%). Other significant findings included larger mean LAA ostium diameter for Asians vs. Non-Asians (23.4 +- 4.1 mm vs. 21.2 +- 3.2 mm, p < 0.001) and hence requirement for larger median device size (27 mm for Asians, 24 mm for non-Asians [p < 0.0001]). CONCLUSION: Real-world experience of left atrial appendage closure with WATCHMAN has demonstrated low peri-procedural risk, and long-term efficacy for stroke and bleeding prevention in a primarily Asian cohort.
