37858892|t|Role of rafts in neurological disorders.
37858892|a|INTRODUCTION: Rafts are protein-lipid structural nanodomains involved in efficient signal transduction and the modulation of physiological processes of the cell plasma membrane. Raft disruption in the nervous system has been associated with a wide range of disorders. DEVELOPMENT: We review the concept of rafts, the nervous system processes in which they are involved, and their role in such disorders as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer disease, and Huntington disease. CONCLUSIONS: In view of the available evidence, preservation and/or reconstitution of rafts is a promising treatment strategy for a wide range of neurological disorders.
