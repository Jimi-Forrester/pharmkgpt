36923088|a|Background: Depression is a common clinical psychiatric disorder that is responsible for health-related disease burdens globally. According to traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), mental disorders and qi stagnation are important pathogenic mechanisms of depression. The Chaihu Longgu Oyster Decoction, which has been documented in the Shanghanlun (Treatise on Typhoid), is widely used to treat various affective disorders. Methods: Network pharmacology and molecular docking technology were used to investigate the material basis and mechanism of action of the Chaihu Longgu oyster adjusted decoction in treating depression. The main pharmacological substance bases, possible targets, and pathways of Chaihu Longgu oyster adjusted decoction in treating depression were visualized by constructing a "component-pathway-target" network. Results: Quercetin, 7-methoxy-2-methylisoflavone, baicalein, kaempferol, and lignan are the main practical chemical components in Chaihu Longgu oyster adjusted decoction. The Chaihu Longgu oyster adjusted decoction regulates 74 protein targets and 142 pathways associated with depression. Its molecular mechanism involves inhibiting neuroinflammation and improving neurotransmitter function, neuroplasticity, etc. Conclusions: The underlying mechanism of the anti-depressive effect of the Chaihu Longgu oyster adjusted decoction may involve neuroinflammatory response reduction and improvement of neurotransmitter function and neuroplasticity. This study revealed the mechanism of action of the Chaihu Longgu oyster adjusted decoction in the treatment of depression through network pharmacology, which provides a scientific basis for clinical application.
