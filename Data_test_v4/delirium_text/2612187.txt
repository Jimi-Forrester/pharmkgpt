2612187|t|Learning of a complex arithmetic skill in dementia: further evidence for a dissociation between compilation and production.
2612187|a|An amnesic Alzheimer's Disease patient was tested on his ability to learn an algorithm to square two-digit numbers. The results indicated a dissociation in the patient's ability to execute the individual steps of the algorithm and his ability to combine the steps of the algorithm, the former accounting for almost all of the improvement in response time. The results are discussed in conjunction with findings from Charness et al. (1988) and Milberg et al. (1988) and suggest that skill learning in Alzheimer's Disease may be compromised due to an inability to combine individual steps of a procedure.
