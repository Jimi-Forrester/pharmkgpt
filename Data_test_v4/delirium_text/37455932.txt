37455932|a|Introduction: The prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other dementias is increasing; therefore, identifying individuals at risk for dementia is crucial. Traditional neuropsychological assessments are expensive and time-consuming; however, computerized cognitive testing is becoming popular in clinical and research settings, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to investigate the correlation between the computerized cognitive test, Inbrain cognitive screening test (CST), and the traditional neuropsychological battery, the consortium to establish a registry for Alzheimer's disease assessment packet (CERAD-K). Methods: We enrolled 166 participants from five districts in Republic of Korea, including cognitively unimpaired individuals and those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) diagnosed by experienced neurologists. We used the Inbrain CST and CERAD-K to evaluate the cognitive function of the participants, and the scores of each subtest of the Inbrain CST and CERAD-K were compared. Results: A significant correlation was found between the Inbrain CST and CERAD-K subtests. Furthermore, multivariate analysis revealed a significant correlation between the Inbrain CST and the CERAD-K test pairs after adjusting for age, educational level, and sex. Discussion: In conclusion, this study demonstrates that the Inbrain CST is a reliable tool for detecting cognitive impairment in cognitively unimpaired individuals and patients with MCI, because it has a high correlation and agreement with CERAD-K. Therefore, the Inbrain CST can be a useful, time-efficient, and cost-effective computer-based cognitive test for individuals at risk for cognitive impairment.
