39344228|t|The Role of Osteopontin (OPN) in Regulating Microglia Phagocytosis in Nervous System Diseases.
39344228|a|Phagocytosis is the process by which certain cells or organelles internalise foreign substances by engulfing them and then digesting or disposing of them. Microglia are the main resident phagocytic cells in the brain. It is generally believed that microglia/macrophages play a role in guiding the brain's repair and functional recovery processes. However, the resident and invading immune cells of the central nervous system can also exacerbate tissue damage by stimulating inflammation and engulfing viable neurons. The functional consequences of microglial phagocytosis remain largely unexplored. Overall, phagocytosis is considered a beneficial phenomenon in acute brain injury because it eliminates dead cells and induces an anti-inflammatory response. Osteopontin (OPN) is a phosphorylated glycoprotein induced by injury in various tissues, including brain tissue. In acute brain injuries such as hemorrhagic stroke and ischemic stroke, OPN is generally believed to have anti-inflammatory effects. OPN can promote the reconstruction of the blood-brain barrier and up-regulate the scavenger receptor CD36. But in chronic diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), OPN can cause microglia to engulf neurons and worsen disease progression. We explored the role of OPN in promoting microglial phagocytosis in nervous system disorders.
