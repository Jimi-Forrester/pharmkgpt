35585109|a|This paper studies the effect of different ultrasonic parameters on the yield of extraction and antioxidant activity of selected phenolic compounds from Sorbus intermedia berries. The sonication was carried out in two modes: continuous and pulse. In the pulse mode, the samples were sonicated with the following processor settings: 1 s on-2 s off. The effective ultrasonic processor times were 5, 10, and 15 min, and the total extraction times were 15, 30, and 45 min. The results showed that the duty cycle significantly affected the antioxidant activity of the extracts and the yield of chlorogenic acid, rutin, and total flavonoids. Compared to the continuous mode, the pulse ultrasound increased the extraction yield of rutin by 5-27%, chlorogenic acid by 12-29%, and total flavonoids by 8-42%. The effect of the duty cycle on the extraction yield was dependent on the intensity and duration of the ultrasound treatment. The mechanism of the influence of the pulsed ultrasound field on the extraction process has been elucidated. This research clearly demonstrated the superiority of pulsed ultrasound-assisted extraction for production of antioxidants from Sorbus intermedia berries.
