30111271|a|The present study investigated the effect of high-temperature-processed green tea extract (HTP_GTE) and its bioactive components on the reduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and amyloid-beta (Abeta) protein in human microvascular endothelial cells. Compared to Abeta1-42-only treatment, pretreatment of HTP_GTE was revealed to effectively inhibit ROS generation (P<0.05). HTP_GTE and catechins not only inhibit Abeta1-42 fibril formation but also destabilize preformed Abeta1-42 fibrils. The presence of HTP_GTE, Abeta1-42 fibril formation was significantly inhibited in a dose-dependent manner at 12.5-100 mug/ml of HTP_GTE, showing 86-56%, respectively. Treatment of various concentrations of HTP_GTE and catechins steadily destabilized the preformed Abeta1-42 fibrils for 24 h in a dose-dependent manner. It was observed that the gallated groups such as epigallocatechin gallate, epicatechin gallate, gallocatechin gallate, and catechin gallate more effectively disturbed Abeta1-42 fibril formation and destabilized the preformed Abeta1-42 fibrils than the non-gallated group. Taken together, these findings supported that sterilized green tea could be promising natural anti-amyloidogenic agents associated with therapeutic approaches in Alzheimer's disease by scavenging ROS generation and Abeta fibril in the brain tissue.
