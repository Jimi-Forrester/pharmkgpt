37779568|a|Patients aged 65 and older are the fastest growing segment in the population of many countries. Based on evolving demographics showing increasing life expectancies, it is expected that there will be a concurrent rise in the demand for a large variety of surgical and anesthesia services. Surgery offers definitive management of many age-related diseases and provides symptom-relieving (morbidity) and life-extending (mortality) benefits. However, elderly adult surgical patients, especially the frail ones, often require a different level of care than younger patients during the perioperative period. As many have chronic illnesses and acquired deconditioning and functional decline, older patients are prone to develop untoward outcomes such as postoperative complications and loss of independence. This manuscript focuses on the holistic quality person-centered care, supported by a wide stakeholder team of health-care workers, ensuring fidelity to comprehensive geriatric assessment and optimization services where possible, offering a systematic approach to early health risk assessment and risk modification in the perioperative period, with the ultimate goal of reducing postoperative complications and health-care costs. The "comprehensive geriatric assessment and optimization" cost-effective approach builds on robust evidence with older people more likely to be alive, a shorter length of hospital stay due to fewer postoperative medical complications, and improved rates of return to usual residence. Prehabilitation programs are delivered focusing on primary (through counseling) and secondary prevention (through screening) with an aim to improve fitness for surgery, by evaluating functional capacity, nutritional and psychological health, prompting interventions, targeting physical exercise, lifestyle and nutritional advice, and psychological support.
