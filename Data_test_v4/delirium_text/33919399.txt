33919399|t|Regulatory Role of Nrf2 Signaling Pathway in Wound Healing Process.
33919399|a|Wound healing involves a series of cellular events in damaged cells and tissues initiated with hemostasis and finally culminating with the formation of a fibrin clot. However, delay in the normal wound healing process during pathological conditions due to reactive oxygen species, inflammation and immune suppression at the wound site represents a medical challenge. So far, many therapeutic strategies have been developed to improve cellular homeostasis and chronic wounds in order to accelerate wound repair. In this context, the role of Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) during the wound healing process has been a stimulating research topic for therapeutic perspectives. Nrf2 is the main regulator of intracellular redox homeostasis. It increases cytoprotective gene expression and the antioxidant capacity of mammalian cells. It has been reported that some bioactive compounds attenuate cellular stress and thus accelerate cell proliferation, neovascularization and repair of damaged tissues by promoting Nrf2 activation. This review highlights the importance of the Nrf2 signaling pathway in wound healing strategies and the role of bioactive compounds that support wound repair through the modulation of this crucial transcription factor.
