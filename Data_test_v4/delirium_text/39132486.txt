39132486|a|The health care system is insufficiently capitalizing on the benefits of physical exercise in America's aging population. Few tools exist to help clinicians incorporate physical activity into their clinical care, while barriers limit older adults from initiating and maintaining exercise programs. The Lifestyle Empowerment for Alzheimer's Prevention (LEAP! Rx) Program has been designed to support providers and participants in lifestyle change. LEAP! Rx uses two forms of participant enrollment: physician referrals through electronic health records and self-referrals to test the efficacy of delivering a community-based exercise and healthy lifestyle program to older adults. After referral into the program, participants are randomized to receive the LEAP! Rx Program or are placed in a standard-of-care group to receive the program later. The LEAP! Rx program consists of a personalized and structured exercise program, lifestyle education, and mobile health monitoring. This includes a 12-week Empowerment phase with coaching and supervised exercise training, followed by a 40-week Lifestyle phase with intermittent supervised exercise and coaching. Lifestyle education includes monthly, evidence-based classes on optimal aging. The evaluation of LEAP! Rx focuses on 1) the assessment of implementation and scalability of the LEAP!Rx Program for clinicians and patients 2) the effect of the LEAP! Rx Program on cardiorespiratory fitness, 3) the impact of the LEAP! Rx Program on secondary intervention outcome measures of chronic disease risk factors, including insulin resistance, body composition, and lipids. If successful, this study's findings could advance future healthcare practices, providing a new and practical approach to aging and chronic disease prevention.
