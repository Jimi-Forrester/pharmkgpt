32040045|t|Hyperactive Terminal Delirium in Hospice Patients: A Retrospective Cohort Study.
32040045|a|Terminal delirium is a common occurrence in patients at the end of life, and its presence is widely accepted as a poor prognostic indicator. The hyperactive subtype is characterized by psychomotor agitation that is distressing to patients, caregivers, and providers. The purpose of this study was to determine whether physical, psychosocial, or spiritual data collected at hospice admission are associated with development of hyperactive terminal delirium. In this retrospective cohort study, 154 patients were assigned to one of two cohorts depending on whether or not they had signs of hyperactive terminal delirium. Hospice admission data from the Hospice Item Set, psychosocial assessment, and spiritual assessment were analyzed using descriptive statistics, inferential statistics, and logistic regression. Although there were no statistically significant relationships among the physical, psychosocial, and spiritual variables and hyperactive terminal delirium, there were some findings that are clinically significant for nurses caring for patients at the end of life. Specifically, this study highlights the importance of ongoing physical, psychosocial, and spiritual assessment throughout the end-of-life trajectory, as well as prompt management of symptoms.
