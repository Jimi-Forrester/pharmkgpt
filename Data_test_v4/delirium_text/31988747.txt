31988747|a|Background: alpha-Synuclein is a small soluble protein, whose physiological function in the healthy brain is poorly understood. Intracellular inclusions of alpha-synuclein, referred to as Lewy bodies (LBs), are pathological hallmarks of alpha-synucleinopathies, such as Parkinson's disease (PD) or dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Main body: Understanding of the molecular basis as well as the factors or conditions promoting alpha-synuclein misfolding and aggregation is an important step towards the comprehension of pathological mechanism of alpha-synucleinopathies and for the development of efficient therapeutic strategies. Based on the conversion and aggregation mechanism of alpha-synuclein, novel diagnostic tests, such as protein misfolding seeded conversion assays, e.g. the real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC), had been developed. In diagnostics, alpha-synuclein RT-QuIC exhibits a specificity between 82 and 100% while the sensitivity varies between 70 and 100% among different laboratories. In addition, the alpha-synuclein RT-QuIC can be used to study the alpha-synuclein-seeding-characteristics of different alpha-synucleinopathies and to differentiate between DLB and PD. Conclusion: The variable diagnostic accuracy of current alpha-synuclein RT-QuIC occurs due to different protocols, cohorts and material etc.. An impact of micro-environmental factors on the alpha-synuclein aggregation and conversion process and the occurrence and detection of differential misfolded alpha-synuclein types or strains might underpin the clinical heterogeneity of alpha-synucleinopathies.
