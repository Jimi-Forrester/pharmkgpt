29021836|a|This short review looks at Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis through my own point of view, going from imaging through cerebrospinal fluid to blood proteins. Over the last couple of years, we have published two papers targeted at Alzheimer's diagnosis. In one paper, we took an approach of selecting a specific target, namely, activity-dependent neuroprotective protein (ADNP), and our results tightened the association of ADNP blood expression with intelligence. In another paper, we took an unbiased approach of analysis of all genes expressed in lymphoblastoid cells lines and discovered changes in expression of the regulator of G-protein signaling 2 (RGS2) as a potential AD predictor. This review will assess our data in comparison to selected independent studies focusing on blood protein biomarkers as well as assessing saliva and urine samples with potential predictive value for AD. Furthermore, the review will provide directions for a combination of innovative markers, stratifying the population toward disease prevention and personalized medicine.
