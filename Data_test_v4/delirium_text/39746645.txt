39746645|t|Statins for vascular dementia: A hype or hope.
39746645|a|Vascular dementia (VaD) is a second most common type of dementia subsequent to Alzheimer disease (AD). VaD is characterized by cognitive impairment and memory loss that may progress due to the development of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) a hallmark of AD. CAA triggers the progression of ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes with the subsequent the development of VaD and mixed dementia. Early diagnosis of patients with appropriate use of anti-inflammatory can prevent CAA-related inflammation and VaD development. Currently, there are no effective drugs in the management of VaD. Of note, cholesterol-lowering agent statins which are commonly used in patients with vascular diseases and dyslipidemia may affect the progression of VaD. Many previous studies highlighted the potential therapeutic efficacy of statins in treating VaD. Though, the underlying mechanisms of statins in prevention and treatment of VaD are not fully clarified. Consequently, this review aims to discuss the mechanistic role of statins in the management of VaD, and how statins may adversely affect the cognitive function in VaD patients.
