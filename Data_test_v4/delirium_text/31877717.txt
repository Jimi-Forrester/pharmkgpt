31877717|t|Dendrimers as Pharmaceutical Excipients: Synthesis, Properties, Toxicity and Biomedical Applications.
31877717|a|The European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the Current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) in the United States of America, define excipient as the constituents of the pharmaceutical form other than the active ingredient, i.e., any component that is intended to furnish pharmacological activity. Although dendrimers do not have a pharmacopoeia monograph and, therefore, cannot be recognized as a pharmaceutical excipient, these nanostructures have received enormous attention from researchers. Due to their unique properties, like the nanoscale uniform size, a high degree of branching, polyvalency, aqueous solubility, internal cavities, and biocompatibility, dendrimers are ideal as active excipients, enhancing the solubility of poorly water-soluble drugs. The fact that the dendrimer's properties are controllable during their synthesis render them promising agents for drug-delivery applications in several pharmaceutical formulations. Additionally, dendrimers can be used for reducing the drug toxicity and for the enhancement of the drug efficacy. This review aims to discuss the properties that turn dendrimers into pharmaceutical excipients and their potential applications in the pharmaceutical and biomedical fields.
