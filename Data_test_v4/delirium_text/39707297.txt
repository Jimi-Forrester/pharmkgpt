However, whether air pollution exposure related cognitive decline is dependent on inflammation remains uncertain. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present study collected data from China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) at baseline in 2011, with a follow up period in 2015. Concentration of air pollutants (particles with diameters <= 1.0 mum [PM1], <= 2.5 mum [PM2.5], <= 10 mum [PM10], nitrogen dioxide [NO2] and ozone [O3]) were obtained from China High Air Pollutants (CHAP) dataset. Hypersensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), a systemic inflammation marker, was measured in blood of subjects and cognitive function was assessed by standardized questionnaire. RESULTS: A total of 6434 participants were included in the study. Lower exposure to PM2.5, PM1, PM10 and NO2 were associated with mitigated cognitive decline. The odds ratios (ORs) for air pollutants changes and cognitive decline and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were as follows: PM2.5-0.934(0.925, 0.943), PM1- 0.945 (0.935,0.955), PM10-0.977(0.972,0.982) and NO2-0.962(0.950,0.975), respectively. Hs-CRP showed no significant correlation with cognitive decline or change in levels of air pollution. The interaction regression analyses, both unadjusted and adjusted, did not uncover any significant correlation between hs-CRP and air pollution with respect to cognitive decline. Bootstrap test exhibited no significant mediating effect of hs-CRP on the relationship between any air pollutants and cognitive decline, the indirect effects of hs-CRP in conjunction with exposure to different air pollutants were all found to be non-significant, with the following bootstrap CIs and p-values: PM2.5-1.000([1.000,1.000], P = 0.480),PM1-1.000([1.000,1.000], P = 0.230),PM10-1.000([1.000,1.000], P = 0.650), O3-1.000([1.000,1.000], P = 0.470), DeltaNO2-1.000([1.000,1.000], P = 0.830) . CONCLUSION: Ambient air pollution exposure was linked to cognitive decline independent of hs-CRP level.
