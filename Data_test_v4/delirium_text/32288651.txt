32288651|t|Critical Care of the Liver Transplant Recipient.
32288651|a|Patient survival following orthotopic liver transplantation has greatly increased following improvements in surgical technique, anesthetic care, and immunosuppression. The critical care of the liver transplant recipient has paralleled these improvements, largely thanks to input from multidisciplinary teams and institution-specific protocols guiding management and care. This article provides an overview of the approach to critical care of the postoperative adult liver transplant recipient outlining common issues faced by the intensivist. Approaches to extubation and hemodynamic assessment are described. The provision of appropriate immunosuppression, infection prophylaxis, and nutrition is addressed. To aid prompt diagnosis and treatment, intensivists must be aware of postoperative complications of bleeding, primary nonfunction, delayed graft function, vascular thromboses, biliary complications, rejection, and organ dysfunction.
