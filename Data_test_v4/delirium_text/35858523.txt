35858523|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD), as the fourth leading cause of death among the elderly worldwide, has brought enormous challenge to the society. Due to its extremely complex pathogeneses, the development of multi-target directed ligands (MTDLs) becomes the major strategy for combating AD. Carbamate moiety, as an essential building block in the development of MTDLs, exhibits structural similarity to neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) and has piqued extensive attention in discovering multifunctional cholinesterase inhibitors. To date, numerous preclinical studies demonstrate that carbamate-based cholinesterase inhibitors can prominently increase the level of ACh and improve cognition impairments and behavioral deficits, providing a privileged strategy for the treatment of AD. Based on the recent research focus on the novel cholinesterase inhibitors with multiple biofunctions, this review aims at summarizing and discussing the most recent studies excavating the potential carbamate-based MTDLs with cholinesterase inhibition efficacy, to accelerate the pace of pleiotropic cholinesterase inhibitors for coping AD.
