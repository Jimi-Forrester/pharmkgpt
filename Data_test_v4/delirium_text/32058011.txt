32058011|a|CONTEXT: Health care professionals (HCPs) currently judge pain presence and intensity in patients with delirium despite the lack of a valid, standardized assessment protocol. However, little is known about how they make these judgments. This information is essential to develop a valid and reliable assessment tool. OBJECTIVES: To identify pain cues that HCPs report to judge pain in patients with delirium and to examine whether the pain cues differed based on patient cognitive status and delirium subtype. METHODS: Mixed qualitative-quantitative design. Doctors and nurses were recruited. All participants provided written informed consent, and before the recorded interview, demographic information was collected; then participants were asked to describe their practices and beliefs regarding pain assessment and management with older patients who are cognitively intact and patients with delirium. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and coded for pain cues. Coded data were imported into SPSS software (IBM SPSS Statistics Version 24; IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY) to conduct bivariate analyses. RESULTS: The pain cue self-report was stated more often for intact than for delirium patients (chi2 [1; N = 106] = 22.56; P < 0.001). HCPs stated yelling (chi2 [2; N = 159] = 11.14; P = 0.004), when describing pain in hyperactive than in hypoactive and mixed delirium patients; and significantly more HCPs stated grimace (chi2 [2; N = 159] = 6.88; P = 0.03), when describing pain in hypoactive than hyperactive and mixed patients. CONCLUSION: This study outlines how HCPs conduct pain assessment in patients who are delirious and, also, identifies pain behavior profiles for the subtypes of delirium.
