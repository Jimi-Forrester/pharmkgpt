1283363|t|Monoamine neurotransmitters and their metabolites in brain regions in Alzheimer's disease: a postmortem study.
1283363|a|1. Concentrations of the neurotransmitter amines noradrenaline (NA), dopamine (DA), and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and the acid metabolites homovanillic acid (HVA) and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) were determined in four regions of postmortem brains of demented patients with or without Alzheimer's disease (AD). 2. NA was deficient in the temporal cortex (BA 21) of AD, but not of non-AD, patients. 3. Caudate, in particular, had an impaired dopaminergic system in AD patients, with low HVA levels. 4. In all regions investigated [amygdala, caudate, putamen, temporal cortex (BA 21)] 5-HT was significantly depleted in AD patients, and 5-HIAA was also depleted in amygdala and caudate. 5. These results indicate that neurotransmitter systems other than cholinergic systems are also widely affected in AD and suggest that these deficits may also play an important role in determining the symptomatology of AD.
