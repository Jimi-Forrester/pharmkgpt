36455873|a|BACKGROUND: Inhalation of sevoflurane can cause neuronal apoptosis, and cognitive disorders, inducing to the occurrence and progression of post operative cognitive dysfunction (POCD). This study aimed to explore the roles of sevoflurane-induced POCD-associated exosomes on HMC3 cells and its related mechanisms. METHODS: Exosomes were isolated from the plasma of sevoflurane-induced POCD or non-POCD patients, and were then sent for small RNA sequencing. Real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) was used to verify the sequencing results, and miR-584-5p was chosen for subsequent study. HMC3 cells were respectively transfected with POCD-derived exosomes and miR-584-5p mimics, and cell viability and apoptosis were measured. Dual-luciferase reporter gene assay was applied to confirm the target of miR-584-5p. RESULTS: After sequencing, 301 differentially expressed miRNAs were identified, including 184 up-regulated miRNAs and 117 down-regulated miRNAs, and were significantly enriched in 3577 GO terms and 121 KEGG pathways. Due to the high level of miR-584-5p in sevoflurane-treated POCD-derived exosomes, HMC3 cells with miR-584-5p enrichment were successfully established. Compared with the control group, POCD-derived exosomes and miR-584-5p significantly inhibited viability and promoted apoptosis of HMC3 cells (P < 0.05). The IL-1beta and TNF-alpha levels were significantly increased after POCD-derived exosomes and miR-584-5p mimics treatment compared to the control group (P < 0.05). Besides, POCD-derived exosomes and miR-584-5p mimics significantly down-regulated the expression levels of BDNF and p-TrkB, and up-regulated Caspase 3 and IL-1beta. Finally, BDNF was confirmed to be the target of miR-584-5p. CONCLUSIONS: Sevoflurane-induced POCD-associated exosomes delivered miR-584-5p may regulate the growth of HMC3 cells via targeting BDNF.
