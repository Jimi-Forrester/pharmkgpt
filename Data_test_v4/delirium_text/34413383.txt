34413383|a|Since 2006, Ficus dubia has been reported as a new Ficus species in Thailand. As per our recent report, the red-brown aqueous extract of F. dubia sap (FDS) has been determined to strongly exhibit in vitro anti-radicals. However, the phytochemicals in the FDS extract related to health-promoting antioxidation have not been explored. Thus, in this study, we aimed to investigate the chemical components of the F. dubia sap extract by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/QTOF-MS) and its potential use in cosmetics in terms of cellular antioxidation on keratinocytes (HaCaT), phototoxicity, and irritation on 3D skin cell models following standard tests suggested by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). It was found that the sap extract was composed of quinic acid and caffeoyl derivatives (e.g., syringoylquinic acid, 3-O-caffeoylquinic acid, 4-O-caffeoylquinic acid, and dimeric forms of caffeoylquinic acids). The extract has significantly exhibited antioxidant activity against H2O2-induced oxidative stress in HaCaT cells. The cellular antioxidative effect of the FDS extract was remarkably dependent on the presence of 3- and 4-O-caffeoylquinic acid in the extract. Furthermore, the FDS extract showed negative results on skin phototoxicity and irritation. Overall, the results reveal that the FDS extract could be developed as a new antioxidant candidate for a skin healthcare product.
