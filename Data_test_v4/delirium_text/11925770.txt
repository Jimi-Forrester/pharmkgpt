11925770|a|Beside the loss of the memory capacity, non-cognitive disturbances occur up to 70%-90% in patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease due to pathological changes in the brain. Delusion, hallucination and changes of the circadian rhythm can appear in addition to the five kinds of disorder--agitation, aggressive behaviour, screaming, depression and constant hyperkinesia. The consequences of these changes in perception and behaviour constitute severe problems for the patient as well as for the main caregiver. The burden of caring often exceeds their energy and resources. Not only do many of those caregivers suffer themselves from exhaustion but also from feelings of guilt and depression. The therapeutic concept includes the involvement of the relatives through information, support, counselling and guidance as much as the investigation of the causes and interrelation of the problematic behaviour in each individual case and further involves the carer in creating a concept to deal in an optimal way with the patient.
