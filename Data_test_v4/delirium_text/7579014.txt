7579014|t|What provision is made by practicing physicians for psychogeriatric patients in western Germany?
7579014|a|This study examined some aspects of psychogeriatric care in Munster, Germany. The diagnostic and therapeutic attitudes of 94 general practitioners/internists and neurologists/psychiatrists toward demented patients were investigated by questionnaire. This figure represents a return rate of approximately 55% on the questionnaires. As is typical in Germany, no physicians were specializing in geriatric patients, and fewer general practitioners/internists than neurologists/psychiatrists had undergone supplementary psychogeriatric training. A higher percentage of the latter group estimated more than 10% of their elderly patients were demented. Both estimated Alzheimer's disease as less frequent than multi-infarct dementia. Physicians with training in psychogeriatrics claimed to treat more elderly patients than physicians without it. With regard to therapeutic procedure, physicians with psychogeriatric training prescribed nootropics more guardedly. The data from this pilot study suggest that there are no eminent discrepancies between the different medical groups with regard to psychogeriatric care, but there is a great need for supplementary training.
