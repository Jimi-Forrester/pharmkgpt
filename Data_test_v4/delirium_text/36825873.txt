36825873|t|Highly Oxidized Ecdysteroids from a Commercial Cyanotis arachnoidea Root Extract as Potent Blood-Brain Barrier Protective Agents.
36825873|a|Ecdysteroid-containing herbal extracts, commonly prepared from the roots of Cyanotis arachnoidea, are marketed worldwide as a "green" anabolic food supplement. Herein are reported the isolation and complete 1H and 13C NMR signal assignments of three new minor ecdysteroids (compounds 2-4) from this extract. Compound 4 was identified as a possible artifact that gradually forms through the autoxidation of calonysterone. The compounds tested demonstrated a significant protective effect on the blood-brain barrier endothelial cells against oxidative stress or inflammation at a concentration of 1 muM. Based on these results, minor ecdysteroids present in food supplements may offer health benefits in various neurodegenerative disease states.
