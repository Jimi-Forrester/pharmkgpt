28194376|a|OBJECTIVE: To analyze the mortality rate at one-year follow-up of patients with hip fracture who underwent surgery at the university hospital of this institution. METHOD: The authors reviewed 213 medical records of hospitalized patients aged 65 years or older, following to the order they were admitted to the orthopedics and traumatology service from January 2012 to August 2013. RESULTS: One-year mortality rate was 23.6%. Mortality was higher among women, with a 3:1 ratio. Anemia (p = 0.000) and dementia (p = 0.041) were significantly associated with the death group. Patients who remained hospitalized for less than 15 days and who were discharged within seven days after surgery showed increased survival. CONCLUSION: In the present sample of patients with hip fracture who underwent surgery, one-year mortality rate was 23.6%, and the main comorbidities associated with this outcome were anemia and dementia.
