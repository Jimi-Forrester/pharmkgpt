38037179|t|Potentially inappropriate medicine use and predicting risk factors in hospitalized older adult patients: findings of a prospective observational study from Ethiopia.
38037179|a|BACKGROUND: Older patients are fragile and more susceptible to medication-related problems requiring a strict assessment of their medicine list. The present study was conducted with the intention to assess the quality use of medicines in older adult patients by detecting potentially inappropriate medicine use and its predictive risk factors. METHODS: This prospective cross-sectional study involved 162 older medical patients admitted to Jimma Medical Center. A data abstraction format is employed to capture relevant information. Each patient was assessed for the presence of potentially inappropriate medicine using the 2019 American Geriatrics Associations Beers Criteria. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression analysis were conducted using STATA 15.0. A p value < 5% was considered a cutoff point for declaring statistical significance. RESULTS: Over the hospital stay, 103 (63.6%) participants were on polypharmacy (5-9 concurrent medicines per patient), while 16 (9.9%) were on hyper polypharmacy (>= 10 concurrent medicines per patient). On medicine use assessment using the Beers criteria, at least one potentially inappropriate medicine was detected in 118 (73%) participants. Overall, 191 potentially inappropriate medicines (range, 0 to 4) were identified, and 27 (14.1%) of these were associated with avoiding recommendations. Furosemide [83 (43%)], tramadol [26 (14.5%)], and spironolactone [22 (11.4%)] were the top three most frequent potentially inappropriate medicines identified. In terms of mode of prescription, 187 (96.9%) potentially inappropriate medicines were prescribed on a scheduled basis. Older adult patients with thrombocytopenia had a lower probability of taking potentially inappropriate medicine, while the odds of potentially inappropriate medicine use were 7.35 times higher in patients diagnosed with heart failure. CONCLUSIONS: Nearly three-fourths of the participants had potentially inappropriate medicine in their medicine list. Therefore, generating local evidence on the clinical, economic, and humanistic consequences may help in determining whether the Beers criteria should be taken into account when prescribing medicine to older adults. Interventions targeting older adult patients with heart failure might reduce inappropriate medicine use.
