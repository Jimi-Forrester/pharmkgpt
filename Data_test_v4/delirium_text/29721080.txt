29721080|a|Development of a rapid and sensitive method for Abeta(1-42) aggregation detection is of great importance to overcome the limitations of conventional techniques. In this study, we developed a label-free paper-based electrochemiluminescence sensor for amyloid-beta aggregation detection toward potential diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The paper-based chip used in the system serves as a low-cost and disposable detection method. In this detection platform, the bonding of [Ru(phen)2dppz]2+ to Abeta(1-42) aggregates results in enhanced electrochemiluminescence due to the change in the polarity of the microenvironment when [Ru(phen)2dppz]2+ intercalated into the beta-sheets during oligomerization. The oligomerization process of Abeta(1-42) can be monitored in real time by the novel method, and as low as 100 pM equivalent monomer concentration of Abeta(1-42) could be detected simultaneously. In addition, the cerebrospinal fluid of transgenic AD model mice was tested by this method, which is highly consistent with genetic identification. In addition, we demonstrated that this detection platform could be a potential new method for the screening of Abeta(1-42) aggregation inhibitors, highlighting the practical application capacity of this platform. The platform is label free, low cost and sensitive. Therefore, the proposed platform holds great promise for the diagnosis of AD.
