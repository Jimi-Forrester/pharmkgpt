31660156|t|The social context of substance use among older adults: Implications for nursing practice.
31660156|a|AIM: The purposes of this paper are (a) to critically analyse the social context of substance use among older adults and (b) to offer strategies for nurses and other health care providers to support the health of older adults experiencing problematic substance use. DESIGN: Discussion paper. METHODS: This analysis is informed by two theoretical lenses: an intersectional lens in examining the various factors influencing health and health care access; and a social justice lens, focusing on promoting health equity for older populations. RESULTS: As a result of various social and sociopolitical factors, key issues are likely to arise for older adults experiencing problematic substance use including health and social inequities, stigma, and discrimination, all of which can result in serious negative health outcomes. Health care providers can help mitigate these effects by (a) promoting harm reduction principles; (b) participating in social justice actions; and (c) engaging in contextual assessments of substance use.
