31944877|t|Dexmedetomidine: A Novel Strategy for Patients with Intractable Pain, Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia, or Delirium at the End of Life.
31944877|a|Dexmedetomidine, a selective alpha2 agonist, is traditionally used briefly for perioperative anesthesia and sedation of mechanically ventilated patients. Reports of its use in patients with opioid-induced hyperalgesia1 and intractable pain and delirium2 suggested it for patients who otherwise may have required palliative sedation to relieve suffering. We present the protocol developed by the interdisciplinary team in our intensive palliative care unit that allows for safe titrated administration without required vital sign monitoring outside the intensive care unit (ICU) (Supplementary Appendix SA1). We describe its efficacy in eight patients who were receiving comfort-focused care.
