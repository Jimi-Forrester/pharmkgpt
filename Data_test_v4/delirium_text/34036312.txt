34036312|t|Nattokinase Attenuates Retinal Neovascularization Via Modulation of Nrf2/HO-1 and Glial Activation.
34036312|a|Purpose: Nattokinase (NK), an active ingredient extracted from traditional food Natto, has been studied for prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases due to various vasoprotective effects, including fibrinolytic, antihypertensive, anti-atherosclerotic, antiplatelet, and anti-inflammatory activities. Here, we reported an antineovascular effect of NK against experimental retinal neovascularization. Methods: The inhibitory effect of NK against retinal neovascularization was evaluated using an oxygen-induced retinopathy murine model. Expressions of Nrf2/HO-1 signaling and glial activation in the NK-treated retinae were measured. We also investigated cell proliferation and migration of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) after NK administration. Results: NK treatment significantly attenuated retinal neovascularization in the OIR retinae. Consistently, NK suppressed VEGF-induced cell proliferation and migration in a concentration-dependent manner in cultured vascular endothelial cells. NK ameliorated ischemic retinopathy partially via activating Nrf2/HO-1. In addition, NK orchestrated reactive gliosis and promoted microglial activation toward a reparative phenotype in ischemic retina. Treatment of NK exhibited no cell toxicity or anti-angiogenic effects in the normal retina. Conclusions: Our results revealed the anti-angiogenic effect of NK against retinal neovascularization via modulating Nrf2/HO-1, glial activation and neuroinflammation, suggesting a promising alternative treatment strategy for retinal neovascularization.
