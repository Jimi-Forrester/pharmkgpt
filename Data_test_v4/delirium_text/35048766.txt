35048766|t|Ligand-based discovery of new potential acetylcholinesterase inhibitors for Alzheimer's disease treatment.
35048766|a|The enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is currently a therapeutic target for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. These diseases have highly variable causes but irreversible evolutions. Although the treatments are palliative, they help relieve symptoms and allow a better quality of life, so the search for new therapeutic alternatives is the focus of many scientists worldwide. In this study, a QSAR-SVM classification model was developed by using the MATLAB numerical computation system and the molecular descriptors implemented in the Dragon software. The obtained parameters are adequate with accuracy of 88.63% for training set, 81.13% for cross-validation experiment and 81.15% for prediction set. In addition, its application domain was determined to guarantee the reliability of the predictions. Finally, the model was used to predict AChE inhibition by a group of quinazolinones and benzothiadiazine 1,1-dioxides obtained by chemical synthesis, resulting in 14 drug candidates with in silico activity comparable to acetylcholine.
