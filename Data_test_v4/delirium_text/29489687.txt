29489687|t|Misdiagnosis of idiopathic hypoparathyroidism: A case report and literature review.
29489687|a|RATIONALE: Idiopathic hypoparathyroidism (IHP) is a rare endocrine condition, which is frequently represented by neuropsychiatric disorders. Hence, the misdiagnosis rate of the disease is rather high, especially for neurologists. PATIENT CONCERNS: We reported a case of misdiagnosed, atypical IHP. In addition, the literature on IHP and the misdiagnosis published in China in the past 2 decades has been reviewed and summarized. DIAGNOSES: Blood testing confirmed that parathyroid hormone (PTH) = 0 pg/mL and the final diagnosis was IHP. INTERVENTIONS AND OUTCOMES: With calcium and vitamin D supplementation, the patient's myasthenia improved significantly, and muscle enzymes returned to normal gradually. One-year follow-up demonstrated that the patient's myasthenia disappeared, and the blood calcium and PTH levels were normal. In addition, the literature on IHP and the misdiagnosis published in China in the past 2 decades has been reviewed and summarized. LESSONS: The misdiagnosis rate of IHP in China was high in the past 2 decades, which might be attributed to the misdiagnosis as epilepsy or mental diseases. A clinician should be able to understand the disease and emphasize the screening of high-risk population, especially for those patients with hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and increased blood creatine kinase with unknown causes or nontypical clinical symptoms.
