35592543|t|Inflammation-Related Gene Signature for Predicting the Prognosis of Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma.
35592543|a|Purpose: The inflammatory response was associated with the prognosis of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). This study aimed to perform a novel prognostic signature based on inflammation-related genes (IRGs) for a better understanding of the prognosis of HNSCC. Patients and Methods: IRGs were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Functional enrichment analysis was performed to explore potential pathways. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression as well as the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) were utilized to construct an IRGs-based prognostic model on TCGA database and the GEO database was utilized for outcome validation. The nomogram model was constructed based on independent prognostic factors after univariate and multivariate Cox regression. The immune cell infiltration level was analyzed via the Tumor Immune Estimation Resource (TIMER) database. Results: In this study, we confirmed that 60% IRGs were abnormally expressed in HNSCC samples, and these were associated with important oncobiology. Then, a prognostic signature comprising 7 hub genes was generated based on TCGA database. The results were validated in 97 patients from GSE41613. A nomogram comprising risk score, age, M stage and N stage was generated to improve the accuracy of prognosis evaluation. The immune cell infiltration analysis suggested that 5 hub genes (ADGRE1, OLR1, TIMP1, GPR132 and CCR7) were negatively correlated with tumor purity and positively correlated with the infiltration of immune cells. Conclusion: Our study established a novel signature consisting of 7 hub genes for the prognostic prediction in patients with HNSCC.
