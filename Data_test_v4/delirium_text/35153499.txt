35153499|a|It is widely recognized that microbial disorders are involved in the pathogenesis of many malignant tumors. The oral and intestinal tract are two of the overriding microbial habitats in the human body. Although they are anatomically and physiologically continuous, belonging to the openings at both ends of the digestive tract, the oral and intestinal microbiome do not cross talk with each other due to a variety of reasons, including intestinal microbial colonization resistance and chemical barriers in the upper digestive tract. However, this balance can be upset in certain circumstances, such as disruption of colonization resistance of gut microbes, intestinal inflammation, and disruption of the digestive tract chemical barrier. Evidence is now accruing to suggest that the oral microbiome can colonize the gut, leading to dysregulation of the gut microbes. Furthermore, the oral-gut microbes create an intestinal inflammatory and immunosuppressive microenvironment conducive to tumorigenesis and progression of colorectal cancer (CRC). Here, we review the oral to intestinal microbial transmission and the inflammatory and immunosuppressive microenvironment, induced by oral-gut axis microbes in the gut. A superior comprehension of the contribution of the oral-intestinal microbes to CRC provides new insights into the prevention and treatment of CRC in the future.
