38248288|t|Artificial Intelligence's Transformative Role in Illuminating Brain Function in Long COVID Patients Using PET/FDG.
38248288|a|Cutting-edge brain imaging techniques, particularly positron emission tomography with Fluorodeoxyglucose (PET/FDG), are being used in conjunction with Artificial Intelligence (AI) to shed light on the neurological symptoms associated with Long COVID. AI, particularly deep learning algorithms such as convolutional neural networks (CNN) and generative adversarial networks (GAN), plays a transformative role in analyzing PET scans, identifying subtle metabolic changes, and offering a more comprehensive understanding of Long COVID's impact on the brain. It aids in early detection of abnormal brain metabolism patterns, enabling personalized treatment plans. Moreover, AI assists in predicting the progression of neurological symptoms, refining patient care, and accelerating Long COVID research. It can uncover new insights, identify biomarkers, and streamline drug discovery. Additionally, the application of AI extends to non-invasive brain stimulation techniques, such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), which have shown promise in alleviating Long COVID symptoms. AI can optimize treatment protocols by analyzing neuroimaging data, predicting individual responses, and automating adjustments in real time. While the potential benefits are vast, ethical considerations and data privacy must be rigorously addressed. The synergy of AI and PET scans in Long COVID research offers hope in understanding and mitigating the complexities of this condition.
