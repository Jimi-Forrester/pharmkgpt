39722066|t|Mobilization in Neurocritical Care: Challenges and Opportunities.
39722066|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Mobilization in the Neurological Intensive Care Unit (NICU) significantly improves outcomes and functional recovery while preventing immobility-related complications. The heterogeneity of neurologic conditions necessitates tailored, interdisciplinary mobilization strategies. This article reviews recent research on enhancing the feasibility and effectiveness of mobilization interventions in NICU settings. RECENT FINDINGS: Early mobilization improves functional outcomes, reduces complications like muscle atrophy and pressure ulcers, and can shorten ICU stays. Safe implementation involves individualized protocols and a multidisciplinary team, emphasizing that early mobilization benefits critically ill neurological patients. Development of evidenced-based protocols for interdisciplinary NICU patient mobilization enhances patient outcomes and quality of life. Use of outcome measures can facilitate mobility while preventing complications from immobility. Future research in embracing emerging technologies such as mobilization equipment and virtual/augmented reality will help determine optimal timing as well as dosage of mobility to improve long-term functional outcomes in the unique NICU population.
