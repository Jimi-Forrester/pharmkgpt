25532446|t|Combining serum and urine biomarkers in the early diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment that evolves into Alzheimer's disease in patients with the apolipoprotein E epsilon4 genotype.
25532446|a|Possession of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon4 genotype is a major predictor of progression to Alzheimer's disease (AD), particularly in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). However, the use of APOE genotyping in the diagnosis of MCI is limited due to its low sensitivity and specificity, which often results in a high false-positive rate. In this study, we found that there was a significant decrease in serum BDNF and notable increase in urine AD7c-NTP in MCI patients who harbored the APOE epsilon4 allele. Both serum BDNF and urine AD7c-NTP had higher positive predictive values and were more sensitive biomarkers of MCI. Additionally, a testing strategy employing serum BDNF and urine AD7c-NTP revealed increases in sensitivity, positive and negative predictive values, and predictive ability compared with the use of either biomarker alone, suggested that combinatorial detection might have great potential for translation to the clinic.
