37896460|t|A Nanocomposite Paste Electrode Sensor for Simultaneous Detection of Uric Acid and Bisphenol A Using Zinc Hydroxide Nitrate-Sodium Dodecylsulfate Bispyribac.
37896460|a|The fabrication of a zinc hydroxide nitrate-sodium dodecylsulfate bispyribac modified with multi-walled carbon nanotube (ZHN-SDS-BP/MWCNT) paste electrode for uric acid and bisphenol A detection was presented in this study. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, chronocoulometry, square-wave voltammetry, and cyclic voltammetry were all used to examine the electrocatalytic activities of modified paste electrodes. The modified electrode's sensitivity and selectivity have been considered in terms of the composition of the modifier in percentages, the types of supporting electrolytes used, the pH of the electrolyte, and square-wave voltammetry parameters like frequency, pulse size, and step increment. Square-wave voltammetry is performed by applying a small amplitude square-wave voltage to a scanning potential from -0.3 V to +1.0 V, demonstrating a quick response time and high sensitivity. The ZHN-SDS-BP/MWCNT sensor demonstrated a linear range for uric acid and bisphenol A from 5.0 microM to 0.7 mM, with a limit of detection of 0.4 microM and 0.8 microM, respectively, with good reproducibility, repeatability, and stability as well. The modified paste electrode was successfully used in the determination of uric acid and bisphenol A in samples of human urine and lake water.
