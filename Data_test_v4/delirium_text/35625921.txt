35625921|a|A growing interest in the use of a combination of chemosensitizers and cytostatics for overcoming cancer resistance to treatment and the development of their delivery systems has been observed. Resveratrol (Res) presents antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and chemopreventive properties but also limits multidrug resistance against docetaxel (Dtx), which is one of the main causes of failure in cancer therapy with this drug. However, the use of both drugs presents challenges, including poor bioavailability, the unfavourable pharmacokinetics and chemical instability of Res and the poor water solubility and dose-limiting toxicity of Dtx. In order to overcome these difficulties, attempts have been made to create different forms of delivery for both agents. This review is focused on the latest developments in nanoparticles for the delivery of Dtx, Res and for the combined delivery of those two drugs. The aim of this review was also to summarize the synergistic mechanism of action of Dtx and Res on cancer cells. According to recent reports, Dtx and Res loaded in a nano-delivery system exhibit better efficiency in cancer treatment compared to free drugs. Also, the co-delivery of Dtx and Res in one actively targeted delivery system providing the simultaneous release of both drugs in cancer cells has a chance to fulfil the requirements of effective anticancer therapy and reduce limitations in therapy caused by multidrug resistance (MDR).
