32419792|a|BACKGROUND: Ageing resulted in a progressive loss of muscle mass and strength. Increased oxidative stress in ageing affects the capacity of the myoblast to differentiate leading to impairment of muscle regeneration. Zingiber officinale Roscoe (ginger) has potential benefits in reversing muscle ageing due to its antioxidant property. This study aimed to determine the effect of ginger in the prevention of cellular senescence and promotion of muscle regeneration. METHODS: Myoblast cells were cultured into young and senescent state before treated with different concentrations of ginger standardised extracts containing different concentrations of 6-gingerol and 6-shogaol. Analysis on cellular morphology and myogenic purity was carried out besides determination of SA-beta-galactosidase expression and cell cycle profile. Myoblast differentiation was quantitated by determining the fusion index, maturation index, and myotube size. RESULTS: Treatment with ginger extracts resulted in improvement of cellular morphology of senescent myoblasts which resembled the morphology of young myoblasts. Our results also showed that ginger treatment caused a significant reduction in SA-beta-galactosidase expression on senescent myoblasts indicating prevention of cellular senescence, while cell cycle analysis showed a significant increase in the percentage of cells in the G0/G1 phase and reduction in the S-phase cells. Increased myoblast regenerative capacity was observed as shown by the increased number of nuclei per myotube, fusion index, and maturation index. CONCLUSIONS: Ginger extracts exerted their potency in promoting muscle regeneration as indicated by prevention of cellular senescence and promotion of myoblast regenerative capacity.
