37708866|a|Aim: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is characterized by diffuse hepatic steatosis and has quickly risen to become the most prevalent chronic liver disease. Its incidence is increasing yearly, but the pathogenesis is still not fully understood. Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) is a major pathogen widely prevalent in periodontitis patients. Its infection has been reported to be a risk factor for developing insulin resistance, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and metabolic syndrome. The aim of this review is to evaluate the association between P. gingivalis infection and NAFLD, identify the possible etiopathogenetic mechanisms, and raise public awareness of oral health to prevent and improve NAFLD.Methods: After searching in PubMed and Web of Science databases using 'Porphyromonas gingivalis', 'non-alcoholic fatty liver disease', and 'hepatic steatosis' as keywords, studies related were compiled and examined.Results: P. gingivalis infection is a direct risk factor for NAFLD based on clinical and basic research. Moreover, it induces systematic changes and systemic abnormalities by disrupting metabolic, inflammatory, and immunologic homeostasis.Conclusion: P. gingivalis-odontogenic infection promotes the occurrence and development of NAFLD. Further concerns are needed to emphasize oral health and maintain good oral hygiene for the prevention and treatment of NAFLD.
