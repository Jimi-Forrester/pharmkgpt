37445540|t|It's Time to Go Quantum in Medicine.
37445540|a|As the field of medicine grows and expands, new scientific developments hold great promise for improving quality of care, clinical research, and the diagnosis and treatment of diseases. Quantum physics is a promising field that intersects with medicine much more than originally understood. In terms of diagnosing different diseases, incorporating quantum mechanics into the study of medicine can allow for efficient diagnosis before symptoms even arise in a patient. Applying theory-based mathematical structures that describe neuron transmission throughout the brain and mind on a quantum scale can help us to better understand neurological diseases in patients. Quantum theory can even give plausible explanations for subtle DNA changes and even telomere reduction in patients who develop cancer. Utilizing quantum theory in the field of medicine can help in understanding and applying treatments for a multitude of different diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease or diverse types of cancer, and even expand upon efficient and reliable diagnosis in clinical settings. Quantum physics is a pertinent advancing field that may have a significant impact on expanding medical care and treatment in the near future. In this review, the application of quantum physics in medicine is discussed.
