29417476|t|Qi Fu Yin-a Ming Dynasty Prescription for the Treatment of Dementia.
29417476|a|The Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) theory that "kidneys give rise to marrow, and the brain is the sea of marrow" has been a guide for the clinical application of kidney, qi and blood tonics for prevention and treatment of dementia and improvement in memory. As low resistance end-organs, both the brain and the kidneys are subjected to blood flow of high volumes throughout the cardiac cycle. Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia are two common causes of dementia, and it is increasingly recognized that many older adults with dementia have both AD and vascular pathologies. The underlying molecular mechanisms are incompletely understood, but may involve atherosclerosis, vascular dysfunction, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, history of cardiac disease and possibly, kidney dysfuntion, leading to reduced erythropoietin production, anemia, brain energy deficit and slow excitotoxicity. During the Ming Dynasty, Zhang Jing-Yue used Qi Fu Yin (seven blessings decoction), comprising Panax ginseng, Rehmannia glutinosa, Angelica polymorpha, Atractylodes macrocephala, Glycyrrhiza uralensis, Ziziphus jujube, and Polygala tenuifolia to boost qi and blood circulation, strengthen the heart, and calm the spirit-skillfully linking heart, spleen, kidney, qi, blood and brain as a whole to treat age-related dementia. The purpose of this review is to outline TCM concepts for the treatment of dementia and illustrated with a historical prescription for the treatment of the condition, with the hope that this description may lead to advances in its management.
