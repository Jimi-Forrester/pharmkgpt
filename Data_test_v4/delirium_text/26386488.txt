26386488|t|Physiology of the Alzheimer's disease.
26386488|a|Alzheimer's disease is a disease that is resulted from increased plasma osmolality both the excessive consumption of animal-based proteins and reduction of sodium intake, that resulted to increase plasma osmolality. When we are exposed to high animal-based protein diets throughout life, we gradually lose extracellular sodium and the body cannot retain water, resulting in a gradual rise of plasma osmolality. When the neuronal cells of the central nervous system are exposed to high osmolality stress, they produce of phosphorylated tau, APP, and pathologic beta amyloid protein peptides. The BACE 1 protein which influences the cleavage of amyloid precursor proteins (APP) and affects the production of beta amyloid protein peptides, is also increased in a hyperosmotic stress. When pathologic beta amyloid protein peptides are produced, they are degraded by the ubiquitin proteasome proteolytic pathway, and only then are the neurotoxic effects on the central nervous system manifested, leading to Alzheimer's disease.
