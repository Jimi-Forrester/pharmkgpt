20667675|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's and related diseases have become a major public health issue in all developed countries, particularly with the aging of the population. Given the potential burden of these pathologies, the French government launched a third National Alzheimer's Strategic Plan 2008-2012 in 2008. The aim of the study was to provide French data on the mortality statistics of Alzheimer's and related diseases by age, gender, and geographical area. METHODS: Analyses were based on the number of deaths from Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia, extracted from the 2000-2006 French National Mortality Registry (Inserm-Centre d'epidemiologie sur les causes medicales de deces [CepiDc]). Underlying and multiple causes of death were taken into account. Gender, age, area of residence, and place of death were noted for all subjects deceased with AD or dementia. Mortality rates were standardized on the truncated 60+ French 2006 population. Mortality rates were also estimated by 5-year age groups. Causes of death in demented and nondemented people were compared by estimating an age-adjusted relative-risk ratio. RESULTS: In France, in 2006, AD or dementia was reported as the underlying cause or a multiple cause of death on 45,597 death certificates. Among these death certificates, 70% were women and the mean age at death was 85.9 years. Age-standardized mortality rates were 341/100,000 person-years for men and 333/100,000 person-years for women. Age-specific mortality rates increased with age and were higher in women than in men over 90 years of age. The analysis of the changes in mortality rates showed an overall increase of 11.3% between 2000 and 2006. The most frequent underlying cause when AD or dementia was mentioned as an associated cause were cardiovascular diseases (40.5%), neoplasms (11.9%), and endocrine diseases (8.5%). CONCLUSION: The analysis of mortality data on AD and dementia provides insight into the burden of these diseases in France. If carried out regularly, these analyses can provide trend analyses of mortality rates.
