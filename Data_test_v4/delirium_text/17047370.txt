17047370|t|Modulators and inhibitors of gamma- and beta-secretases.
17047370|a|Most gene mutations associated with Alzheimer's disease point to the metabolism of amyloid precursor protein as a potential cause. The beta- and gamma-secretases are two executioners of amyloid precursor protein processing resulting in amyloid-beta. Significant progress has been made in the selective inhibition of both proteases, regardless of structural information for gamma-secretase. Several peptidic and nonpeptidic leads were identified for both targets.
