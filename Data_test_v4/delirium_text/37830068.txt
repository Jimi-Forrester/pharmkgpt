37830068|t|Listeria meningitis diagnosed by blood culture with fever, neurological symptoms, and no meningeal irritation signs.
37830068|a|Key Clinical Message: Listeria can cause neurological symptoms in immunocompromised and older patients. Additionally, it is impossible to rule out meningitis by the absence of typical meningeal irritation signs. Therefore, patients with fever and neurological impairments should be rapidly examined for blood and cerebrospinal fluid cultures to rule out Listeria meningitis. Abstract: A woman in her 90s developed fever, dysarthria, and transient disturbance of consciousness. Physical examination revealed no meningeal irritation signs. Listeria monocytogenes were detected in her blood culture the following day. Because of an increased number of cells in cerebrospinal fluid, she was diagnosed with Listeria meningitis.
