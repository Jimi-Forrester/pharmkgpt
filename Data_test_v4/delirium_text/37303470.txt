37303470|t|Differences in Analgesia Methods for Open Gastrointestinal Surgery Are Not Associated With Initial Postoperative Ambulation.
37303470|a|Background: A characteristic of modern medical care is the reduction in the length of hospital stay, and several facilities across Japan are working towards this goal. The presence of postoperative pain is correlated with the number of days to hospital discharge. Therefore, this study investigated the relationship between the analgesic methods used in clinical practice and the initial ambulation of postoperative laparotomy patients with severe postoperative worked incisional pain to enable better analgesic management in the future. Methods: This retrospective study collected information from the medical records of 117 patients who underwent laparotomy between December 1, 2019, and October 13, 2020, at the Department of Gastroenterology of the International University of Health and Welfare Mita Hospital. Based on the failure or success of the ambulation process, the patients were divided into the delayed and successful groups, respectively. Results: In the delayed group, patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA) was used in 32 patients, intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (IV-PCA) was used in two patients, continuous worked incisional infiltration anesthesia was used in one patient, and transvenous acetaminophen was used in one patient for postoperative analgesia. In the successful group, PCEA was used in 66 patients, IV-PCA was used in 11 patients, continuous worked incisional infiltration anesthesia was used in three patients, and acetaminophen administered intravenously at patient's request was used in one patient (P = 0.094). Conclusions: No significant differences were observed between different postoperative analgesia methods, suggesting that there may be no association between postoperative ambulation and the postoperative analgesia method.
