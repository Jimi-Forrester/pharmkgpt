952434|a|The authors report ten observations as well as the results of an investigation conducted by ophtalmologists and psychiatrists with intention of better understanding clinical, physiological and psychological problems, provoked by occurance of complications stemming from psychoses which are the result of ophtamological complications. They conclude that it is necessary to form accurate distinctions with regard to the total manifestations of the malady "black patch delirium". They emphasize the fact that its manifestations are not an appanage of the aged ; they especially insist upon not only the role of visual disorientation but also of the social factors which are united with restrictions, beyond those of motor, control and biological imvalances. With regard to etiopathology they acknowledge a need for a combination of organogenic and psychodynamic models to account for each case ; a certain number of communal points can be found : subjects (declined in physical and metal capacities), there is a rapid weaking of the external comportment, resulting in an imptiness, which must be compensated for by a fantasy life or some other physiopathological mecanisms.
