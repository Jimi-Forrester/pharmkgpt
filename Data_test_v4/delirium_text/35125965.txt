35125965|a|BACKGROUND: Several studies have reported that statins have anti-inflammatory effects. Nevertheless, results of clinical trials concerning the effect of statins on the levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and high-sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP) have been inconsistent. Therefore, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) evaluating the effect of statins on CRP and hs-CRP levels in patients with cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). METHODS: Literature search of the major databases was performed to find eligible RCTs assessing the effect of statins on serum levels of CRP and hs-CRP from the inception until the last week of April 2021. The effect sizes were determined for weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: 26 studies were identified (3010 patients and 2968 controls) for hs-CRP and 20 studies (3026 patients and 2968 controls) for CRP. Statins reduced the serum levels of hs-CRP (WMD = -0.97 mg/L; 95% CI: -1.26 to -0.68 mg/L; P < 0.001) and CRP (WMD = -3.05 mg/L; 95% CI: -4.86 to -1.25 mg/L; P < 0.001) in patients with CVDs. Statins decreased the serum levels of hs-CRP in patients receiving both high-intensity and moderate/low-intensity treatments with these drugs. In addition, the duration of treatment longer than 10 weeks decreased hs-CRP levels. Only high-intensity statin treatment could marginally decrease serum levels of CRP in CVDs patients. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis showed the efficacy of statins to reduce the concentrations of CRP and hs-CRP in patients with different types of CVDs.
