38829804|a|This article examines the role of uric acid (UA) in cognitive changes and neurodegeneration, focusing on its functions as an antioxidant and prooxidant. Research suggests that changes in serum UA levels may be associated with the development or delay of cognitive impairment, especially in the context of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. It was revealed that there is a relationship between the level of UA and the dynamics of cognitive functions, indicating the potential neuroprotective properties of UA. Particular attention is paid to the balance between the antioxidant and prooxidant properties of UA, which may play a key role in protecting neurons from damage. However, research results are not clear-cut, highlighting the need for further research to more fully understand the role of UA in cognitive processes. Determining the optimal serum UA level may be an important step in developing strategies for the prevention and treatment of cognitive impairment associated with neurodegeneration. Overall, these studies advance the understanding of the mechanisms underlying the interaction between uric acid metabolism and brain health.
