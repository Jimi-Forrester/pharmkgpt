22554909|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia of late life. To enhance our understanding of AD proteome, the serum proteins were analyzed using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE) combined with nano-high performance liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (nano-HPLC-ESI-MS/MS) followed by peptide fragmentation patterning. In this study, six protein spots with differential expression were identified. Five up-regulated proteins were identified as actin, apolipoprotein A-IV (Apo A-IV), inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain H4 (ITIH4), alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT), and antithrombin-III (AT-III); one protein, activity-dependent neuroprotector homeobox protein (ADNP) was down-regulated in AD patients. These proteins with differential expression in the serum may serve as potential indicators of AD. Our results suggested that ADNP may play an important role in slowing the progression of clinical symptoms of AD.
