31620661|a|The potential use of stem cells as a therapeutic treatment for many neurological disorders, such as stroke, has spiked an interest in their properties. Due to limitations of the present-day treatments, regenerative and protective therapies could prove very beneficial if a safe and effective treatment is identified. Using human amniotic fluid stem (hAFS) cells could theoretically provide both neuroprotective and regenerative properties to patients, and knowledge of p53's activity and function could be a key component in understanding the behavior and characteristics of these stem cells to harness their full potential. Many recent studies on p53 have provided new and valuable information that could give rise to new ideas for treatment options. More specifically, p53's activity inside hAFS cells lead them closer to becoming a potential therapeutic stem cell. Other neuroprotective treatments, such as hyperoxia and hypoxia sessions, are showing positive results. In combination, these data are helping to get closer to an effective treatment for neurological disorders.
