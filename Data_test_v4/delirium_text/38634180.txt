38634180|a|BACKGROUND: Delirium is an acute and fluctuating disturbance of cognition and is a common occurrence in critically ill patients. It is a manifestation of an acute brain dysfunction often attributed to higher survival rates and a subsequently aging population. Intensive Care Unit (ICU) treatment and survival often contributes towards development of delirium, and lack of or inappropriate management can translate into the development of long-term psychological effects that last even after discharge. While a lot is already known about this topic, and several assessment tools exist, these are not being consistently used by ICU nurses and as a result delirium often goes unrecognized, with unwarranted consequences. AIMS: The study aimed to explore the perception of delirium among ICU nurses, and the extent of their awareness about guidelines to assess and prevent delirium in ICU patients. It also sought to understand the application of delirium guidelines in ICU practice. STUDY DESIGN: A quantitative, exploratory, self-reporting survey was conducted among 145 ICU nurses from one critical care unit in the Republic of Ireland. RESULTS: The overall response rate was 71% (103/145). Most nurses (85%) who participated in this survey believed delirium was expected. However, only 45% acknowledged it is a complication. Only 31% of nurses monitored delirium using a validated scale and few observed this as a part of routine care. Most nurses had received education; however, this did not translate to their clinical practice. CONCLUSIONS: Guidelines on managing delirium may not be routinely implemented in the ICU settings of hospitals in the Republic of Ireland. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: As the findings suggest, a gap exists between theory and practice, necessary revision of policy or creating a new policy, supplemental educational sessions such as bedside sessions, e-learning module, study day or seminars need to be organized to improve nurses' awareness related to delirium and delirium prevention guidelines.
