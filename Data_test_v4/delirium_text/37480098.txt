37480098|t|Vacuoles, E1 enzyme, X-linked, autoinflammatory, and somatic syndrome in the intensive care unit: a case report.
37480098|a|BACKGROUND: Vacuoles, E1 enzyme, X-linked, autoinflammatory, and somatic syndrome is a newly discovered inflammatory disease affecting male subjects, for which few data exist in the literature. Here, we describe the case of a patient with known Sweet's syndrome admitted to the intensive care unit and for whom a vacuoles, E1 enzyme, X-linked, autoinflammatory, and somatic syndrome was diagnosed, allowing for appropriate treatment and the patient's discharge and recovery. CASE PRESENTATION: A 70-year-old male White patient was hospitalized in the intensive care unit following an intrahospital cardiac arrest. History started a year before with repeated deep vein thrombosis and episodes of skin eruption compatible with Sweet's syndrome. After a course of oral steroids, fever and inflammatory syndrome relapsed with onset of polychondritis, episcleritis along with neurological symptoms and pulmonary infiltrates. Intrahospital hypoxic cardiac arrest happened during patient's new investigations, and he was admitted in a critical state. During the intensive care unit stay, he presented with livedoid skin lesions on both feet. Vasculitis was not proven; however, cryoglobulinemia screening came back positive. Onset of pancytopenia was explored with a myelogram aspirate. It showed signs of dysmyelopoiesis and vacuoles in erythroid and myeloid precursors. Of note, new deep vein thrombosis developed, despite being treated with heparin leading to the diagnosis of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. The course of symptoms were overlapping multiple entities, and so a multidisciplinary team discussion was implemented. Screening for UBA1-mutation in the blood came back positive, confirming the vacuoles, E1 enzyme, X-linked, autoinflammatory, and somatic syndrome. Corticosteroids and anti-IL1 infusion were started with satisfactory results supporting patient's discharge from intensive care unit to the internal medicine ward. CONCLUSIONS: Vacuoles, E1 enzyme, X-linked, autoinflammatory, and somatic syndrome should be suspected in male patients presenting with inflammatory symptoms, such as fever, skin eruption, chondritis, venous thromboembolism, and vacuoles in bone marrow precursors. Patients with undiagnosed vacuoles, E1 enzyme, X-linked, autoinflammatory, and somatic syndrome may present with organ failure requiring hospitalization in intensive care unit, where screening for UBA1 mutation should be performed when medical history is evocative. Multidisciplinary team involvement is highly recommended for patient management, notably to start appropriate immunosuppressive treatments.
