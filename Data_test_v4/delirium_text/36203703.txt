36203703|a|Aims: Potentially inappropriate medications had been found associated with adverse drug events such as falls, emergency department admissions and hospital readmissions. There is lack of information about the prevalence of potentially inappropriate medications and associated chronic conditions in older patients with diabetes in China. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of potentially inappropriate medications in older adults with diabetes in an outpatient visitation setting and the association with polypharmacy due to comorbidities. Materials and methods: This was a 3-year repeated cross-sectional study which conducted in outpatient setting of 52 hospitals in Shenzhen, China, using 2019 Beers criteria. The prevalence of potentially inappropriate medications, polypharmacy and comorbidities in older adults with diabetes in an outpatient setting was expressed as percentages. Logistic models were used to investigate the association between potentially inappropriate medication exposure and age, sex, polypharmacy and comorbidities. Results: Among the 28,484 older adults with diabetes in 2015, 31,757 in 2016 and 24,675 in 2017, the prevalence of potentially inappropriate medications was 43.2%, 44.88% and 42.40%, respectively. The top five potentially inappropriate medications were diuretics (20.56%), benzodiazepines (13.85%), androgens (13.18%), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (12.94%) and sulfonylureas (6.23%). After adjustment for age and polypharmacy, the probability of potentially inappropriate medication exposure was associated with chronic gastrointestinal diseases, followed by osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, chronic pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, tumor, dementia, chronic liver disease, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease and hyperlipemia. Conclusion: Potentially inappropriate medications were common in older patients with diabetes in an outpatient visitation setting. Higher probability of potentially inappropriate medication exposure was associated with the comorbidity chronic gastrointestinal diseases as well as osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. To ensure that iatrogenic risks remain minimal for older adults with diabetes, the clinical comorbidities should be considered.
