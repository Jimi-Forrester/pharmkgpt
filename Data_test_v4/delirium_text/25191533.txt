25191533|a|Neuronal abnormalities in neurodegenerative disorders such as Huntington disease, Alzheimer disease or Parkinson disease have been the primary focus of decades of research. However, increasing evidences indicate that glial cells and more specifically astrocytes could be as important players as their big brother. It is now particularly evident in Huntington disease where astrocytal potassium channels have emerged as a likely key factor in the pathogenesis of the disease.
