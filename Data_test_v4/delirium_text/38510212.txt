38510212|t|In vivo PET classification of tau pathologies in patients with frontotemporal dementia.
38510212|a|Frontotemporal dementia refers to a group of neurodegenerative disorders with diverse clinical and neuropathological features. In vivo neuropathological assessments of frontotemporal dementia at an individual level have hitherto not been successful. In this study, we aim to classify patients with frontotemporal dementia based on topologies of tau protein aggregates captured by PET with 18F-florzolotau (aka 18F-APN-1607 and 18F-PM-PBB3), which allows high-contrast imaging of diverse tau fibrils in Alzheimer's disease as well as in non-Alzheimer's disease tauopathies. Twenty-six patients with frontotemporal dementia, 15 with behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia and 11 with other frontotemporal dementia phenotypes, and 20 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were included in this study. They underwent PET imaging of amyloid and tau depositions with 11C-PiB and 18F-florzolotau, respectively. By combining visual and quantitative analyses of PET images, the patients with behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia were classified into the following subgroups: (i) predominant tau accumulations in frontotemporal and frontolimbic cortices resembling three-repeat tauopathies (n = 3), (ii) predominant tau accumulations in posterior cortical and subcortical structures indicative of four-repeat tauopathies (n = 4); (iii) amyloid and tau accumulations consistent with Alzheimer's disease (n = 4); and (iv) no overt amyloid and tau pathologies (n = 4). Despite these distinctions, clinical symptoms and localizations of brain atrophy did not significantly differ among the identified behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia subgroups. The patients with other frontotemporal dementia phenotypes were also classified into similar subgroups. The results suggest that PET with 18F-florzolotau potentially allows the classification of each individual with frontotemporal dementia on a neuropathological basis, which might not be possible by symptomatic and volumetric assessments.
