35505128|t|The aging immune system in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.
35505128|a|The neurodegenerative diseases Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) both have a myriad of risk factors including genetics, environmental exposures, and lifestyle. However, aging is the strongest risk factor for both diseases. Aging also profoundly influences the immune system, with immunosenescence perhaps the most prominent outcome. Through genetics, mouse models, and pathology, there is a growing appreciation of the role the immune system plays in neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we explore the intersection of aging and the immune system in AD and PD.
