This study compares wrist-worn accelerometry-derived PA measures against traditional risk factors for incident AD in the UK Biobank. METHODS: Of 42,157 UK Biobank participants 65 years and older who had accelerometry data and no prior AD diagnosis, 157 developed AD by April 1, 2021 (264,988 person-years or on average 6.2 years of follow-up). 12 traditional predictors and 8 accelerometer-based PA measures were used in single- and multivariate Cox models. Their predictive performances for future AD diagnosis were compared across models using the repeated cross-validated concordance (rcvC). To account for potential reverse causality, sensitivity analyses were conducted by removing dropouts and cases within the first six months, one year, and two years. RESULTS: The best-performing individual predictors of incident AD were age (p < 0.0001, rcvC = 0.658) and moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA, p = 0.0001, rcvC = 0.622). Forward selection produced a model that included age, diabetes, and MVPA, rcvC = 0.681). Adding MVPA to the model containing age and diabetes improved its rcvC from 0.665 to 0.681 (p = 0.0030), more than all other potential risk factors considered. CONCLUSION: Objective PA summaries are the best single predictors among modifiable risk factors with a predictive performance close to that of age. Adding PA summaries to traditional risk factors for AD substantially increases the predictive performance of these models. Increasing MVPA by 14.5 minutes/day reduces the hazard substantially, equivalent to two years younger.
