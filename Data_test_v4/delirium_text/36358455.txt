36358455|t|Myeloperoxidase as a Potential Biomarker of Acute-Myocardial-Infarction-Induced Depression and Suppression of the Innate Immune System.
36358455|a|While myeloperoxidase (MPO) serves as an indicator of both neutrophil and innate-immune-system function, the potential suppression of the innate immune system in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI)-induced depression might be evidenced by a decrease in MPO serum levels. The aim of this prospective study was to (1) determine whether serum concentrations of MPO vary immediately and 6 months after AMI and (2) to investigate whether MPO concentrations at the time of the AMI are significant predictors of AMI-induced depression and the depression-associated suppression of the innate immune system. A total of 109 AMI patients were assessed with the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD-17) immediately after admission to the hospital and 6 months later. The MPO status was assessed with serum samples, which were also collected immediately and 6 months after AMI. The depressive patients showed significantly lower MPO blood levels immediately and 6 months after the AMI compared to the patients without depression (ANCOVA: MPO (depression) F = 4.764, df = 1, p = 0.031). The baseline MPO was observed as a significant predictor (p = 0.027) of AMI-induced depression 6 months after AMI. MPO is a potential biomarker for AMI-induced depression, indicating a depression-associated suppression of the innate immune system.
