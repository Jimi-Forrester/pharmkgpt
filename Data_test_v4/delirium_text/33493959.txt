33493959|a|Ebolavirus disease (EVD) is a severe, highly contagious, and often fatal systemic disease in human and non-human primates. Zoonotic and human-to-human transmission have been well documented. Ebolaviruses are endemic to Equatorial and West Africa and there have been over 20 outbreaks in sub-Saharan Africa since 1976. The largest known outbreak of EVD occurred between 2013 and 2016 across several West African countries. It resulted in 28,646 suspected and confirmed cases and 11,323 deaths. There are 5 species within the genus Ebolavirus with 4 of them being clinically significant. In patients with EVD, neurologic manifestations range from mild symptoms such as confusion to severe neurologic diseases such as meningitis and encephalitis. Altered mental status, from mild confusion to delirium with hallucinations, may also occur. Rare neuropsychiatric manifestations of EVD include psychological or cognitive symptoms, including short-term memory loss, insomnia, and depression or anxiety. Although Ebolavirus RNA has been detected in cerebrospinal fluid, the body of knowledge around the pathogenic mechanisms of neurological disease is not yet fully understood. Studies are needed to understand the acute and chronic neuronal pathologic as well as biochemical cerebrospinal fluid changes in Ebolavirus infection.
