30129226|t|Brain histamine modulates recognition memory: possible implications in major cognitive disorders.
30129226|a|Several behavioural tests have been developed to study and measure emotionally charged or emotionally neutral memories and how these may be affected by pharmacological, dietary or environmental manipulations. In this review, we describe the experimental paradigms used in preclinical studies to unravel the brain circuits involved in the recognition and memorization of environmentally salient stimuli devoid of strong emotional value. In particular, we focus on the modulatory role of the brain histaminergic system in the elaboration of recognition memory that is based on the judgement of the prior occurrence of an event, and it is believed to be a critical component of human declarative memory. The review also addresses questions that may help improve the treatment of impaired declarative memory described in several affective and neuropsychiatric disorders such as ADHD, Alzheimer's disease and major neurocognitive disorder.
