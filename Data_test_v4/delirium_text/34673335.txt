34673335|a|More than a year after the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is still a major global challenge for scientists to understand the different dimensions of infection and find ways to prevent, treat, and develop a vaccine. On January 30, 2020, the world health organization (WHO) officially announced this new virus as an international health emergency. While many biological and mechanisms of pathogenicity of this virus are still unclear, it seems that cytokine storm resulting from an immune response against the virus is considered the main culprit of the severity of the disease. Despite many global efforts to control the SARS-CoV-2, several problems and challenges have been posed in controlling the COVID-19 infection. These problems include the various mutations, the emergence of variants with high transmissibility, the short period of immunity against the virus, the possibility of reinfection in people improved, lack of specific drugs, and problems in the development of highly sensitive and specific vaccines. In this review, we summarized the results of the current trend and the latest research studies on the characteristics of the structure and genome of the SARS-CoV- 2, new mutations and variants of SARS-CoV-2, pathogenicity, immune response, virus diagnostic tests, potential treatment, and vaccine candidate.
