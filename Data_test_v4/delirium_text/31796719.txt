31796719|a|Accumulating evidences show that the vestibular system contributes to cognitive function, including visuospatial ability, memory, and attention. Conversely, cognitive processes appear to affect the vestibular system. Based on the assumption that cognitive impairment correlates to increased perception of dizziness, we recruited 308 adults with cognitive decline from neurodegenerative disorders and administered neuropsychological tests and the Dizziness Handicap Inventory. Global cognitive measures did not correlate with increased dizziness, whereas attentional and visuospatial cognitive ability was correlated with scores of the Dizziness Handicap Inventory. Furthermore, patients with both cognitive impairment and postural instability experienced notably worse dizziness than those without postural instability, suggesting that postural instability is an important determinant of dizziness.
