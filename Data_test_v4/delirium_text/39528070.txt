39528070|t|Mitochondrial dysfunction as a therapeutic strategy for neurodegenerative diseases: Current insights and future directions.
39528070|a|Neurodegenerative diseases, as common diseases in the elderly, tend to become younger due to environmental changes, social development and other factors. They are mainly characterized by progressive loss or dysfunction of neurons in the central or peripheral nervous system, and common diseases include Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease and so on. Mitochondria are important organelles for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production in the brain. In recent years, a large amount of evidence has shown that mitochondrial dysfunction plays a direct role in neurodegenerative diseases, which is expected to provide new ideas for the treatment of related diseases. This review will summarize the main mechanisms of mitochondrial dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases, as well as collating recent advances in the study of mitochondrial disorders and new therapies.
