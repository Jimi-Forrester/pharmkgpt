35070449|t|Incidence and Risk Factors of Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia among Patients with Delirium in the Intensive Care Unit: A Prospective Observational Study.
35070449|a|INTRODUCTION: The incidence and risk factors for ventilator-related pneumonia (VAP) in patients with delirium are deficient, and there is a lack of in-depth knowledge of the impact of VAP on outcomes in this population. We investigated the incidence, risk factors, and outcomes of VAP in patients with delirium. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective observational study was performed in a surgical ICU at Be'sat Hospital in Hamadan, Iran, between 2018 and 2019. A total of 108 patients with delirium were identified using the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) for the ICU and Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC) and enrolled in this study. The association between VAP and delirium, risk factors, and outcomes (ICU length of stay and ICU mortality) for VAP were investigated using the Cox proportional hazards model and logistic and simple linear regression analyses with a 95% confidence interval. RESULTS: Of 108 delirium patients, 86 patients (79.6%) underwent mechanical ventilation (MV) and 16 patients (18.6%) experienced VAP during ICU stay. The median onset of VAP was 6.5 (IQR 4.2-7.7) days after intubation. Delirium patients with VAP stayed longer in the ICU (21.68 +- 4.26 vs.12.93 +- 1.71, P < 0.001) and also had higher ICU mortality (31.25% vs. 0%, P < 0.001) than subjects without VAP. According to multivariate cox regression, the expected HR for VAP was 53.5% lower for patients with early-onset delirium than in patients with late-onset delirium (HR: 0.465, 95% CI: 0.241-0.894, P=0.022). However, the expected hazard for VAP was 1.854 times and 4.604 times higher in patients with longer ICU stay (HR: 1.854, 95% CI: 1.689-3.059, P=0.032) and in patients with a prolonged MV duration (HR: 4.604, 95%CI: 1.567-6.708, P=0.023). CONCLUSION: According to the results, there seems to be an inverse relationship between early onset of delirium and VAP. This finding cannot be conclusively cited, and more studies in this filed should be conducted with a larger sample size. Furthermore, VAP in delirium patients is associated with increases in poor outcomes (higher ICU mortality) and the use of medical resources (longer stay in the ICU and MV duration).
