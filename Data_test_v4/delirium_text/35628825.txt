35628825|t|Transversal Arch Clamping for Complete Resection of Aneurysms of the Distal Ascending Aorta without Open Anastomosis.
35628825|a|BACKGROUND: The extent of aortic replacement for aneurysms of the distal ascending aorta remains controversial and opinions vary between standard cross-clamp resection and open hemiarch anastomosis in circulatory arrest and selective cerebral perfusion. As the deleterious effects of extended circulatory arrest are well-known, borderline indication for distal ascending aorta aneurysm repair must be outweighed against the potential risk of complications related to the open anastomosis. In the present study, we describe our own approach consisting of "transversal arch clamping" for exhaustive resection of aneurysms of the distal ascending aorta without open anastomosis and we present the postoperative outcomes. METHODS: Between May 2017 and December 2019, 35 patients with aneurysm of the ascending aorta (20 male, 15 female) underwent replacement with repair of the lesser curvature without circulatory arrest. Pre-operative, intraoperative, and postoperative clinical outcomes were retrospectively withdrawn from our institutional database and analyzed. RESULTS: Maximal diameter of distal ascending aorta was 47.5 mm. Patient median age was 66 years (IQR 14) (range 42-86). Preoperative logistic median EuroSCORE II was 17% (IQR 11.3). Median duration of cardiopulmonary bypass and cardiac arrest were 137 (IQR 64) and 93 (IQR 59) min, respectively. In-hospital and 30-day mortality were 0%. There were no cases with acute low output syndrome, surgical re-exploration for bleeding, kidney injury requiring dialysis, or wound infection. Disabling stroke was observed in one patient (2.9%). There was one case of major ventricular arrhythmia (2.9%). CONCLUSIONS: Our institutional experience suggests that this novel technique is safe and feasible. It facilitates complete resection of the aortic ascending aneurysm avoiding circulatory arrest, antegrade cerebral perfusion, additional peripheral cannulation, and all related complications.
