39560812|a|Oxidative stress has been implicated in several chronic pathological conditions, leading to cell death and injury. Alzheimer's disease (AD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have several overlapping mechanisms as they are both characterized by increased oxidative stress, inflammation, insulin resistance, and autophagy dysfunction. The objective of this study was to elucidate the possible neuroprotective effect of empagliflozin, a sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i), against hydrogen peroxide-induced neurotoxicity in primary hippocampal neurons derived from wild-type (WT) and transgenic AD rats (TgF344-AD). An in vitro oxidative stress model was established using hydrogen peroxide to induce damage to neurons. Empagliflozin pretreatment was tested on this model initially through a cell viability assay. Flow cytometry and cell sorting were employed to discriminate the apoptotic and necrotic neuronal cell populations. Finally, the morphological and morphometric features of the neurons, including dendritic length and spine density, were evaluated using the SNT ImageJ plug-in following immunostaining with GFP. Sholl analysis was used to evaluate the impact of empagliflozin and hydrogen peroxide on dendritic arborization. Empagliflozin tended to ameliorate hydrogen peroxide-induced toxicity in primary neurons derived from WT rats and led to the preservation of dendritic spine density in both WT and TgF344-AD neurons (one-way ANOVA, p < 0.05). A modest improvement in dendrites' length was also observed. Empagliflozin pretreatment can partially mitigate dendritic and spine alterations induced by hydrogen peroxide in primary neurons. These results underscore the impact of empagliflozin on neuronal morphology and highlight its potential as a candidate for the treatment and/or prevention of AD.
