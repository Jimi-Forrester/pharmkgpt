38062374|t|Twelfth thoracic vertebra erector spinae plane block for postoperative analgesia and early recovery after lumbar spine surgery in elderly patients: a single-blind randomized controlled trial.
38062374|a|BACKGROUND: Severe pain after lumbar spine surgery can delay recovery in elderly patients. We explored the efficacy of T12 erector spinal plane block (ESPB) in elderly patients who underwent lumbar spine surgery. METHODS: A total of 230 patients undergoing lumbar spine surgery were divided and randomly allocated to ultrasound-guided ESPB (n = 115) and control (n = 115) groups. The ESPB group received 20 mL of 0.4% ropivacaine bilaterally at the T12 level after intubation, whereas the control group did not receive a block. The primary outcome was the numeric rating scale (NRS) score at 12 h after surgery. Secondary outcomes included the NRS score and tramadol use within 72 h postoperatively, intraoperative remifentanil use, incidence of postoperative delirium (POD), complications of ESPB, ambulation time, and length of hospitalization after surgery. RESULTS: The12-hour NRS (median (IQR)) score was remarkably lower in the ESPB group than in the control group (2 (1-3) vs. 3 (2-4), p = 0.004), as well as NRS score within 48 h (P < 0.01). The ESPB group had less intraoperative remifentanil use (P < 0.001), and less tramadol use within 72 h postoperatively (P < 0.001). Seven patients (6.7%) developed POD in the ESPB group and ten patients (9.3%) in the control group, without any statistically significant difference (P > 0.05). The ambulation time and length of hospitalization after surgery were shorter in the ESPB group than in the control group (P < 0.05). No ESPB-related complications were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Bilateral T12 ESPB lowered the NRS score within 48 h after lumbar spine surgery, decreased perioperative opioid use and resulted in faster recovery in elderly patients but did not significantly reduce the incidence of POD. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was retrospectively registered at www.chictr.org.cn (ChiCTR2100042037) on January 12, 2021.
