11900737|a|It is claimed that Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients show reduced inhibitory processing and this has been put forward as a reason why AD patients make intrusion errors at recall. However, the evidence to date has been equivocal, because non-inhibitory mechanisms can account for the pattern of findings. Recently, however, a paradigm has been developed that is claimed to give a purer measure of inhibitory processing in episodic memory, the retrieval-induced forgetting (RIF) paradigm [Inhibitory Processes in Attention, Memory and Language, Academic Press, San Diego, 1994, p. 265; J. Exp. Psychol.: Learning, Memory Cognition 20 (1994) 1063; Psychol. Rev. 102 (1995) 68]. Thus, we were interested whether AD patients would show a deficit in inhibitory processing using this procedure. Participants studied lists of category cue-exemplar pairs (e.g. fruit-orange) then practised retrieval for a subset of items from a subset of categories before taking a final memory test for all studied items. As in previous work, inhibition was measured as the difference between final memory performance for unpractised items from practised categories, and unpractised items from unpractised categories. The results show that AD patients showed normal levels of inhibition with both tests of cued recall and category generation (CG). This suggests that a deficit in inhibitory processes during retrieval is not behind the high levels of intrusion errors made in recall in AD.
