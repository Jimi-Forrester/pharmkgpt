38539800|t|Crosstalk between Oxidative Stress and Inflammation Caused by Noise and Air Pollution-Implications for Neurodegenerative Diseases.
38539800|a|Neurodegenerative diseases are often referred to as diseases of old age, and with the aging population, they are gaining scientific and medical interest. Environmental stressors, most notably traffic noise and air pollution, have recently come to the forefront, and have emerged as disease risk factors. The evidence for a connection between environmental risk factors and neurodegenerative disease is growing. In this review, the most common neurodegenerative diseases and their epidemiological association with traffic noise and air pollution are presented. Also, the most important mechanisms involved in neurodegenerative disease development, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation are highlighted. An overview of the in vivo findings will provide a mechanistic link between noise, air pollution, and neurodegenerative pathology. Finally, the importance of the direct and indirect pathways, by which noise and air pollution cause cerebral damage, is discussed. More high-quality data are still needed from both epidemiological and basic science studies in order to better understand the causal connection between neurodegenerative diseases and environmental risk factors.
