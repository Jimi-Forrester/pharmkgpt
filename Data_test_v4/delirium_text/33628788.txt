33628788|t|Recent Advances in Predicting Protein S-Nitrosylation Sites.
33628788|a|Protein S-nitrosylation (SNO) is a process of covalent modification of nitric oxide (NO) and its derivatives and cysteine residues. SNO plays an essential role in reversible posttranslational modifications of proteins. The accurate prediction of SNO sites is crucial in revealing a certain biological mechanism of NO regulation and related drug development. Identification of the sites of SNO in proteins is currently a very hot topic. In this review, we briefly summarize recent advances in computationally identifying SNO sites. The challenges and future perspectives for identifying SNO sites are also discussed. We anticipate that this review will provide insights into research on SNO site prediction.
