DESIGN: Retrospective chart review of patients seen by geriatric consultants. SETTING: Tertiary-care teaching hospital.

The monthly cost of the pharmaceutical interventions was computed based on the drugstore.com cost of acquisition of drugs. RESULTS: A cohort of 62 patients was reviewed with a mean age of 84.6 (+- 7.3) years; 79% were women. The patients presented with an average of 5.6 (+- 2.1) comorbidities of which hypertension, dementia, and musculoskeletal disorders were the most common. The most common reasons for geriatric consultations were neuropsychiatric, nutritional, and gait-related issues.
