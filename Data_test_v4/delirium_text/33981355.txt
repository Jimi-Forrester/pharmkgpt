33981355|a|Using strategies that obtain biomarkers where early symptoms coincide, the early detection of Alzheimer's disease and its complications is essential. Electroencephalogram is a technology that allows thousands of neurons with equal spatial orientation of the duration of cerebral cortex electrical activity to be registered by postsynaptic potential. Therefore, in this paper, the time-dependent power spectrum descriptors are used to diagnose the electroencephalogram signal function from three groups: mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, and healthy control test samples. The final feature used in three modes of traditional classification methods is recorded: k-nearest neighbors, support vector machine, linear discriminant analysis approaches, and documented results. Finally, for Alzheimer's disease patient classification, the convolutional neural network architecture is presented. The results are indicated using output assessment. For the convolutional neural network approach, the accurate meaning of accuracy is 82.3%. 85% of mild cognitive impairment cases are accurately detected in-depth, but 89.1% of the Alzheimer's disease and 75% of the healthy population are correctly diagnosed. The presented convolutional neural network outperforms other approaches because performance and the k-nearest neighbors' approach is the next target. The linear discriminant analysis and support vector machine were at the low area under the curve values.
