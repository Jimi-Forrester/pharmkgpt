16288900|a|There is already considerable evidence from epidemiological, pathological and clinical reports that vascular factors are crucial in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Cerebral hypoperfusion has been shown to be a preclinical condition and a most accurate indicator for predicting whether people will develop AD. Now, a new study by Zlokovic and colleagues reveals that the vascular gene MEOX2 has a low expression in cultured brain endothelial cells from AD patients. This, together with evidence linking a dysfunctional cerebrovasculature to the pathogenesis of AD, suggests that the homeobox gene MEOX2 downregulation provides a therapeutic target to AD and a better understanding of this disorder.
