36361735|t|Reprograming of Gene Expression of Key Inflammatory Signaling Pathways in Human Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells by Soybean Lectin and Resveratrol.
36361735|a|Inflammation is linked to several human diseases like microbial infections, cancer, heart disease, asthma, diabetes, and neurological disorders. We have shown that the prototype inflammatory agonist LPS modulates the activity of Ubiquitin-Proteasome System (UPS) and regulates transcription factors such as NF-kappaB, leading to inflammation, tolerance, hypoxia, autophagy, and apoptosis of cells. We hypothesized that proteasome modulators resveratrol and soybean lectin would alter the gene expression of mediators involved in inflammation-induced signaling pathways, when administered ex vivo to human peripheral blood mononuclear blood cells (PBMCs) obtained from normal healthy controls. To test this hypothesis, analysis of RNA derived from LPS-treated human PBMCs, with or without resveratrol and soybean lectin, was carried out using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS). Collectively, the findings described herein suggest that proteasome modulators, resveratrol (proteasome inhibitor) and lectins (proteasome activator), have a profound capacity to modulate cytokine expression in response to proteasome modulators, as well as expression of mediators in multiple signaling pathways in PBMCs of control subjects. We show for the first-time that resveratrol downregulates expression of mediators involved in several key signaling pathways IFN-gamma, IL-4, PSMB8 (LMP7), and a subset of LPS-induced genes, while lectins induced IFN-gamma, IL-4, PSMB8, and many of the same genes as LPS that are important for innate and adaptive immunity. These findings suggest that inflammation may be influenced by common dietary components and this knowledge may be used to prevent or reverse inflammation-based diseases.
