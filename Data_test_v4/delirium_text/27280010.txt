27280010|t|Validity and Reliability of Health Promoting Lifestyle Profile II in the Iranian Elderly.
27280010|a|BACKGROUND: With increasing age, the prevalence of chronic diseases increases. Since health-promoting behaviors (HPB) are considered a basic way of preventing diseases, especially chronic diseases, it is important to assess HPB. This study examines the validity and reliability of the Health Promoting Lifestyle Profile II (HPLP-II). METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study which is conducted on 502 elderly individuals aged 60 and over in Tehran, Iran. In order to determine the validity, content and construct validity were used. The content validity index (CVI) was used to assess the content validity and to assess construct validity, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), and item-total correlations were employed. For reliability, test-retest analysis was used, and the internal consistency of the HPLP-II was confirmed by Cronbach's alpha. For data analysis, SPSS-18 and Amos-7 software was used. RESULTS: The mean age of the subjects was 66.3 +- 5.3 years. The CVI for the revised HPLP-II and all its subscales was higher than 0.82. The CFA confirmed a six-factor model aligned with the original HPLP-II. Pearson correlation coefficients between the revised HPLP-II and their items were in range of 0.27-0.65. Cronbach's alpha of the revised HPLP-II was obtained as 0.78 and for their subscales were in the range of 0.67-0.84. Intraclass correlation coefficient was obtained 0.79 (95% confidence interval: 0.59-0.86, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The Iranian HPLP-II scale is an appropriate tool for assessing HPBs of the Iranian elderly.
