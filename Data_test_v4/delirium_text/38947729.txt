38947729|t|When Consumption Leads to Catastrophe: A Case of Recurrent Alcohol Withdrawal Catatonia in an Adult Patient.
38947729|a|Catatonia is a motor dysregulation syndrome and a multifaceted neuropsychiatric behavioral syndrome distinguished by abnormal movements, immobility, abnormal behavior, and withdrawal, where patients are unable to move normally despite full physical capacity. Catatonia, in the background of alcohol withdrawal, is a fairly rare phenomenon. Therefore, we are reporting a case where the patient has a history of binge alcohol consumption, with catatonia reoccurring with his withdrawal symptoms, and no other illicit drug use in his history. Its rarity, complex presentation, and potential diagnostic pitfalls necessitate heightened awareness among healthcare professionals.
