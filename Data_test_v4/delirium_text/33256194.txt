33256194|t|Isolation and Characterization of New Anti-Inflammatory and Antioxidant Components from Deep Marine-Derived Fungus Myrothecium SP. Bzo-l062.
33256194|a|In the present study, four new compounds including a pair of 2-benzoyl tetrahydrofuran enantiomers, namely, (-)-1S-myrothecol (1a) and (+)-1R-myrothecol (1b), a methoxy-myrothecol racemate (2), and an azaphilone derivative, myrothin (3), were isolated along with four known compounds (4-7) from cultures of the deep-sea fungus Myrothecium sp. BZO-L062. Enantiomeric compounds 1a and 1b were separated through normal-phase chiral high-performance liquid chromatography. The absolute configurations of 1a, 1b, and 3 were assigned by ECD spectra. Among them, the new compound 1a and its enantiomer 1b exhibited anti-inflammatory activity, inhibited nitric oxide formation in lipopolysaccharide-treated RAW264.7 cells, and exhibited antioxidant activity in the 2,2-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) and oxygen radical absorbance capacity assays.
