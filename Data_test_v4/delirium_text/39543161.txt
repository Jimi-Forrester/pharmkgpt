39543161|a|Mitochondrial dysfunction plays an important role in Parkinson's disease (PD), with mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtDNA-CN) emerging as a potential marker for mitochondrial health. We investigated the links between blood mtDNA-CN and PD severity and risk using the Accelerating Medicines Partnership program for Parkinson's Disease dataset, replicating our results in the UK Biobank. Our findings reveal that reduced blood mtDNA-CN levels are associated with heightened PD risk and increased severity of motor symptoms and olfactory dysfunction. We estimated blood cell composition using complete blood cell profile when available or RNA-sequencing data as a surrogate. After adjusting for blood cell composition, the associations between mtDNA-CN and PD risk and clinical symptoms became non-significant. Bidirectional Mendelian randomization analysis also found no evidence of a direct causal relationship between blood mtDNA-CN and PD susceptibility. Hence peripheral inflammatory immune responses rather than mitochondrial dysfunction underpin these previously identified associations in PD.
