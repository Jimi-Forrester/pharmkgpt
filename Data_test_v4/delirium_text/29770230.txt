29770230|t|The Influence of Education and Apolipoprotein epsilon4 on Mortality in Community-Dwelling Elderly Men and Women.
29770230|a|We investigated the risk of death in relation to the apolipoprotein epsilon4 allele and evaluated how it interacts with education in 504 elderly adults (mean age 73 years, 65.3% women) who were enrolled in 1993 into the New Mexico Aging Process Study. During 9 years of follow-up, apolipoprotein epsilon2 appeared to be associated with a lower risk for all-cause mortality (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.73, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.30-1.71) compared to apolipoprotein epsilon3 carriers in models adjusted for age, sociodemographic variables, medical conditions, adiposity, and lifestyle factors. The apolipoprotein epsilon4 allele conferred almost a threefold elevated risk of mortality (HR = 2.76, CI: 1.42-5.37). An interaction between education and apolipoprotein e4 (p=0.027) was observed with the HR of mortality among e4 carriers compared to noncarriers being 1.59 (0.64-3.96) for those with >=college education; 6.66 (1.90-23.4) for those with some college or trade; and 14.1 (3.03-65.6) for participants with <=high school education. No significant interaction was identified between apolipoprotein E genotype and cognitive function for mortality risk. These findings suggest that genetic (apolipoprotein epsilon4) and environmental (education) factors act interactively to influences survival in the elderly with higher education attenuating the adverse effect of apolipoprotein epsilon4 on mortality.
