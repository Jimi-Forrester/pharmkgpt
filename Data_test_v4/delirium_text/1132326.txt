1132326|t|[Alcohol and malabsorption in the pathogenesis of peripheral and central nerve damage (author's transl)].
1132326|a|Xylose absorption was measured, within ten days of being admitted to hospital, in 54 alcoholics with neurological abnormalities. Small-intestine malabsorption was demonstrated in 19. Classified according to the customary clinical diagnoses, 16 of 49 with alcohol polyneuropathy had abnormal values, with no correlation to nerve conduction velocity. There was also no difference among 14 in predelirium and eight in delirium. However, all four patients with Wernicke's encephalopathy had a malabsorption syndrome. These results are similar, also quantitatively, to those reported in the literature in alcoholics without neurological signs. Alcohol may be involved in the pathogenesis of alcoholic polyneuropathy both as a toxic factor and also via nutritional deficiency.
