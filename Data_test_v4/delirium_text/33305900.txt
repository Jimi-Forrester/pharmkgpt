33305900|t|Subanesthetic dose of ketamine for the antidepressant effects and the associated cognitive impairments of electroconvulsive therapy in elderly patients-A randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical study.
33305900|a|OBJECTIVES: We previously confirmed that low-dose ketamine, as an adjunctive anesthetic for electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in adult patients with depression, accelerates the effects of ECT and reduces the ECT-induced learning and memory deficits. This study explored the efficacy and safety of low-dose ketamine in elderly patients with depression. METHODS: Elderly patients with depression (N = 157) were randomly divided into two groups: propofol anesthesia group (group P) and propofol combined with ketamine anesthesia group (group KP). Patients in group KP were given low-dose ketamine (0.3 mg/kg) for each ECT treatment; patients in group P were given the same amount of normal saline. Depressive symptoms and global cognitive functions were assessed using the 24-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and Mini-Mental State Examination, respectively, at baseline, 1 day after the 1st, 2nd, 4th, and 6th ECT sessions, and 1 day after the end of the ECT course. ECT effects of and complications were recorded. RESULTS: In total, 67 patients in group KP and 70 in group P completed the study. After the ECT, the response and remission rates were 82.09% and 73.13%, respectively, in group KP, and 81.43% and 68.57%, respectively, in group P; there was no statistical difference between groups. However, the incidence of cognitive function impairment was lower in group KP (10.4%) than in group P (25.7%), while different electrical dose and seizure duration were required during the course of treatment between the two groups. There was no difference in the complications of ECT between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Low-dose ketamine is safe as an adjunct anesthetic for elderly patients subjected to ECT. It has a protective effect on cognitive function and may accelerate the antidepressant effects of ECT.
