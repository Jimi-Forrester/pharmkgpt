37393499|t|Nationwide Database Analysis of Risk Factors Associated with Decreased Activities of Daily Living in Patients with Alzheimer's Disease.

OBJECTIVE: To clarify the ADL level of AD patients at diagnosis and the risk factors associated with decreased ADL during long-term care (<=3 years). METHODS: Medical records of AD patients in a Japanese health insurance claims database were analyzed retrospectively to determine ADL using the Barthel Index (BI) and identify the risk factors associated with decreased ADL. RESULTS: A total of 16,799 AD patients (mean age at diagnosis: 83.6 years, 61.5% female) were analyzed. Female patients were older (84.6 versus 81.9 years; p < 0.001) and had lower BI (46.8 versus 57.6; p < 0.001) and body mass index (BMI) (21.0 versus 21.7 kg/m2; p < 0.001) than male patients at diagnosis. Disability (BI<=60) increased at age>=80 years and was significantly higher in females. Complete disability was most frequent for bathing and grooming. Risk factors for decreased ADL were determined separately by sex through comparing the ADL-preserved and ADL-decreased groups using propensity score matching by age and BI and multivariable logistic regression analysis. In males, decreased ADL was significantly associated with BMI < 21.5 kg/m2, stroke, and hip fracture, and inversely associated with hyperlipidemia. In females, decreased ADL was significantly associated with BMI < 21.5 kg/m2 and vertebral and hip fractures, and inversely associated with lower back pain. CONCLUSION: AD patients with low BMI, stroke, and fractures had increased risks of decreased ADL; such patients should be identified early and managed appropriately, including rehabilitation to preserve ADL.
