39386433|t|Distinct Disruptions in CA1 and CA3 Place Cell Function in Alzheimer's Disease Mice.
39386433|a|The hippocampus, a critical brain structure for spatial learning and memory, is susceptible to neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). The APPswe/PSEN1dE9 (APP/PS1) transgenic mouse model is widely used to study the pathology of AD. Although previous research has established AD-associated impairments in hippocampal-dependent learning and memory, the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying these cognitive dysfunctions remain less understood. To address this gap, we investigated the activities of place cells in both CA1 and CA3 hippocampal subregions, which have distinct yet complementary computational roles. Behaviorally, APP/PS1 mice demonstrated impaired spatial recognition memory compared to wild-type (WT) mice in the object location test. Physiologically, place cells in APP/PS1 mice showed deterioration in spatial representation compared to WT. Specifically, CA1 place cells exhibited significant reductions in coherence and spatial information, while CA3 place cells displayed a significant reduction in place field size. Both CA1 and CA3 place cells in APP/PS1 mice also showed significant disruptions in their ability to stably encode the same environment. Furthermore, the burst firing properties of these cells were altered to forms correlated with reduced cognition. Additionally, the theta rhythm was significantly attenuated in CA1 place cells of APP/PS1 mice compared to WT. Our results suggest that distinct alteration in the physiological properties of CA1 and CA3 place cells, coupled with disrupted hippocampal theta rhythm in CA1, may collectively contribute to impaired hippocampal-dependent spatial learning and memory in AD.
