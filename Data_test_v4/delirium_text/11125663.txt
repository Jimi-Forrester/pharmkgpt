11125663|a|Unfortunately, although delirium is common in the general hospital, the diagnosis is frequently missed. As delirium often indicates a serious, sometimes life-threatening, medical or surgical condition, successful management and subsequent prevention of morbidity and mortality require prompt recognition and early intervention. Failure to recognize, diagnose, and treat delirium and the underlying pathology can result in death.
