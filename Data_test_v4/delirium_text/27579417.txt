27579417|t|Hydroperitoneum: A Rare Complication Performing Endoscopic Combined Intrarenal Surgery.
27579417|a|BACKGROUND: Recently endoscopic combined intrarenal surgery (ECIRS) has been introduced as an innovative approach for the treatment of complex single, multiple, and staghorn urolithiasis, which reveals to be a viable alternative to standard percutaneous nephrolithotomy. Although considered to be a versatile, safe, and efficient endoscopic procedure, it is not free from complications. We would like to report two rare cases of hydroperitoneum that occurred during ECIRS and their management. CASE PRESENTATION: Two female patients, respectively, of 75 and 41 years of age, underwent ECIRS procedure for the treatment of complex staghorn kidney urolithiasis, previously evaluated by noncontrast computed tomography (CT) scan. A combined retrograde-percutaneous access to the intrarenal collecting system, under fluoroscopic and ultrasound guidance with the additional assistance of Endovision technique, was performed. At the end of the procedures, both patients revealed a taut and globous abdomen, and a perioperative CT and ultrasonography revealed the presence of intraperitoneal liquid. Both patients were effectively treated with immediate positioning of abdominal drain with rapid improvement of the clinical presentation. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge these are the first two cases of hydroperitoneum occurring during ECIRS and reported in the literature. An early detection of the complication and its prompt treatment revealed to be crucial to effectively prevent morbidity.
