25514969|t|Imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines as cholesterol 24-hydroxylase (CYP46A1) inhibitors: a patent evaluation (WO2014061676).
25514969|a|A series of imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine analogs that effectively inhibit cholesterol 24-hydroxylase (CYP46A1) was reported in WO2014061676. The treatment or prophylaxis of neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, by these novel CYP46A1 inhibitors is claimed in the patent. These compounds represent a novel pharmacophore that is different from other structural motifs described in the prior patent publications by Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd.
