36250040|t|Brain atrophy pattern in patients with mild cognitive impairment: MRI study.
36250040|a|We evaluated the accuracy of the quantitative and semiquantitative analysis in detecting regional atrophy patterns and differentiating mild cognitive impairment patients who remain stable (aMCI-S) from patients who develop Alzheimer's disease (aMCI-AD) at clinical follow-up. Baseline magnetic resonance imaging was used for quantitative and semiquantitative analysis using visual rating scales. Visual rating scores were related to gray matter thicknesses or volume measures of some structures belonging to the same brain regions. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to assess measures' accuracy in differentiating aMCI-S from aMCI-AD. Comparing aMCI-S and aMCI-AD patients, significant differences were found for specific rating scales, for cortical thickness belonging to the middle temporal lobe (MTL), anterior temporal (AT), and fronto-insular (FI) regions, for gray matter volumes belonging to MTL and AT regions. ROC curve analysis showed that middle temporal atrophy, AT, and FI visual scales showed better diagnostic accuracy than quantitative measures also when thickness measures were combined with hippocampal volumes. Semiquantitative evaluation, performed by trained observers, is a fast and reliable tool in differentiating, at the early stage of disease, aMCI patients that remain stable from those patients that may progress to AD since visual rating scales may be informative both about early hippocampal volume loss and cortical thickness reduction.
