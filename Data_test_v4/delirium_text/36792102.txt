36792102|t|Healthcare Professionals' Expectations of Medical Artificial Intelligence and Strategies for its Clinical Implementation: A Qualitative Study.
36792102|a|OBJECTIVES: Although medical artificial intelligence (AI) systems that assist healthcare professionals in critical care settings are expected to improve healthcare, skepticism exists regarding whether their potential has been fully actualized. Therefore, we aimed to conduct a qualitative study with physicians and nurses to understand their needs, expectations, and concerns regarding medical AI; explore their expected responses to recommendations by medical AI that contradicted their judgments; and derive strategies to implement medical AI in practice successfully. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 15 healthcare professionals working in the emergency room and intensive care unit in a tertiary teaching hospital in Seoul. The data were interpreted using summative content analysis. In total, 26 medical AI topics were extracted from the interviews. Eight were related to treatment recommendation, seven were related to diagnosis prediction, and seven were related to process improvement. RESULTS: While the participants expressed expectations that medical AI could enhance their patients' outcomes, increase work efficiency, and reduce hospital operating costs, they also mentioned concerns regarding distortions in the workflow, deskilling, alert fatigue, and unsophisticated algorithms. If medical AI decisions contradicted their judgment, most participants would consult other medical staff and thereafter reconsider their initial judgment. CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare professionals wanted to use medical AI in practice and emphasized that artificial intelligence systems should be trustworthy from the standpoint of healthcare professionals. They also highlighted the importance of alert fatigue management and the integration of AI systems into the workflow.
