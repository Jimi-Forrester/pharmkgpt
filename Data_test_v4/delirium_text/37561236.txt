37561236|t|Sex Differences in Long-term Outcome of Prenatal Exposure to Excess Glucocorticoids-Implications for Development of Psychiatric Disorders.
37561236|a|Exposure to prenatal insults, such as excess glucocorticoids (GC), may lead to pathological outcomes, including neuropsychiatric disorders. The aim of the present study was to investigate the long-term effects of in utero exposure to the synthetic GC analog dexamethasone (Dex) in adult female offspring. We monitored spontaneous activity in the home cage under a constant 12 h/12 h light/dark cycle, as well as the changes following a 6-h advance of dark onset (phase shift). For comparison, we re-analysed data previously recorded in males. Dex-exposed females were spontaneously more active, and the activity onset re-entrained slower than in controls. In contrast, Dex-exposed males were less active, and the activity onset re-entrained faster than in controls. Following the phase shift, control females displayed a transient reorganisation of behaviour in light and virtually no change in dark, while Dex-exposed females showed limited variations from baseline in both light and dark, suggesting weaker photic entrainment. Next, we ran bulk RNA-sequencing in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of Dex and control females. SPIA pathway analysis of ~ 2300 differentially expressed genes identified significantly downregulated dopamine signalling, and upregulated glutamate and GABA signalling. We selected a set of candidate genes matching the behaviour alterations and found consistent differential regulation for ~ 73% of tested genes in SCN and hippocampus tissue samples. Taken together, our data highlight sex differences in the outcome of prenatal exposure to excess GC in adult mice: in contrast to depression-like behaviour in males, the phenotype in females, defined by behaviour and differential gene expression, is consistent with ADHD models.
