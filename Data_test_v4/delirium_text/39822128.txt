39822128|a|The Canadian Stroke Best Practice Recommendations (CSPR) 7th edition includes this new module on the diagnosis and management of vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) with or without neurodegenerative disease. An expert writing group and people with VCI lived experience (PWLE) reviewed current evidence. Existing recommendations were reviewed and revised, and new recommendations added. Sections include definitions, signs and symptoms, screening, assessment, diagnosis, pharmacological and non-pharmacological management, secondary prevention, rehabilitation, and end-of-life care. PWLE were actively involved in all aspects of the development, ensuring their experiences are integrated. A unique VCI journey map, developed by PWLE, is included, and helped to motivate and anchor the recommendations. We encourage it to be displayed across healthcare settings to raise awareness and support persons with VCI. These VCI CSBPRs emphasize the need for integrated multidisciplinary care across the continuum. Evidence for the diagnosis and management of VCI continues to emerge and gaps in knowledge should drive future research. HIGHLIGHTS: This Canadian Stroke Best Practice Recommendations module focuses specifically on VCI using a structured framework and validated methodology. A comprehensive set of evidence-based recommendations is presented that addresses the continuum from symptom onset to diagnosis, management, and end of life. The recommendations consider individuals who experience VCI because of stroke or because of other vascular pathologies such as atrial fibrillation or heart failure. A journey map of an individual's experience with VCI has been developed by individuals with lived experience. It is a valuable guide to inform educational content, approaches to caring for individuals and families with VCI, and systems planning.
