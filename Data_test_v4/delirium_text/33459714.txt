33459714|a|BACKGROUND: Quantitatively predicting the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in an individual on a continuous scale, such as the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive (ADAS-cog) scores, is informative for a personalized approach as opposed to qualitatively classifying the individual into a broad disease category. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the hypothesis that the multi-modal data and predictive learning models can be employed for future predicting ADAS-cog scores. METHODS: Unimodal and multi-modal regression models were trained on baseline data comprised of demographics, neuroimaging, and cerebrospinal fluid based markers, and genetic factors to predict future ADAS-cog scores for 12, 24, and 36 months. We subjected the prediction models to repeated cross-validation and assessed the resulting mean absolute error (MAE) and cross-validated correlation (rho) of the model. RESULTS: Prediction models trained on multi-modal data outperformed the models trained on single modal data in predicting future ADAS-cog scores (MAE12, 24 & 36 months= 4.1, 4.5, and 5.0, rho12, 24 & 36 months= 0.88, 0.82, and 0.75). Including baseline ADAS-cog scores to prediction models improved predictive performance (MAE12, 24 & 36 months= 3.5, 3.7, and 4.6, rho12, 24 & 36 months= 0.89, 0.87, and 0.80). CONCLUSION: Future ADAS-cog scores were predicted which could aid clinicians in identifying those at greater risk of decline and apply interventions at an earlier disease stage and inform likely future disease progression in individuals enrolled in AD clinical trials.
