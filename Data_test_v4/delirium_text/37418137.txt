37418137|t|A Study on Autophagy Related Biomarkers in Alzheimer's Disease Based on Bioinformatics.
37418137|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease with an annual incidence increase that poses significant health risks to people. However, the pathogenesis of AD is still unclear. Autophagy, as an intracellular mechanism can degrade damaged cellular components and abnormal proteins, which is closely related to AD pathology. The goal of this work is to uncover the intimate association between autophagy and AD, and to mine potential autophagy-related AD biomarkers by identifying key differentially expressed autophagy genes (DEAGs) and exploring the potential functions of these genes. GSE63061 and GSE140831 gene expression profiles of AD were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. R language was used to standardize and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of AD expression profiles. A total of 259 autophagy-related genes were discovered through the autophagy gene databases ATD and HADb. The differential genes of AD and autophagy genes were integrated and analyzed to screen out DEAGs. Then the potential biological functions of DEAGs were predicted, and Cytoscape software was used to detect the key DEAGs. There were ten DEAGs associated with the AD development, including nine up-regulated genes (CAPNS1, GAPDH, IKBKB, LAMP1, LAMP2, MAPK1, PRKCD, RAB24, RAF1) and one down-regulated gene (CASP1). The correlation analysis reveals the potential correlation among 10 core DEAGs. Finally, the significance of the detected DEAGs expression was verified, and the value of DEAGs in AD pathology was detected by the receiver operating characteristic curve. The area under the curve values indicated that ten DEAGs are potentially valuable for the study of the pathological mechanism and may become biomarkers of AD. This pathway analysis and DEAG screening in this study found a strong association between autophagy-related genes and AD, providing new insights into the pathological progression of AD. Exploring the relationship between autophagy and AD: analysis of genes associated with autophagy in pathological mechanisms of AD using bioinformatics. 10 autophagy-related genes play an important role in the pathological mechanisms of AD.
