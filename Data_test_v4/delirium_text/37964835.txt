37964835|a|Background: In this study, the regularity of drug containing borneol proprietary Chinese medicine was mined, to provide reference for the clinical application and new drug research and development of borneol. Methods: The database of proprietary Chinese medicines on Pharmaceutical Intelligence Network was searched for internal and external prescriptions that contained borneols and the diseases they treat. Microsoft Office Excel 2019 and SPSS Modeler 18.0 were used to analyze the properties, flavors, meridians tropisms and association rule analysis of the medicines, and Origin 21.0 software was used to draw the association rules diagram. Results: Among them, 528 prescriptions of internal Chinese patent medicine containing borneol and 387 prescriptions of external Chinese patent medicine were included. The diseases treated by internal prescription were mainly neurological diseases and heart diseases, among which Chinese medicines with higher frequency of compatibility with borneol were bezoar, licorice, cinnabar, musk and scutellaria. The diseases treated by external prescription were mainly physical disabilities, paralysis diseases, sore and ulcer diseases and so on. Among them, menthol, camphor, frankincense, angelica, and carthami flos and so on are the most frequently combined with borneol. Conclusion: The prescription of Chinese patent medicine containing borneol is composed of cold or warm, pungent or bitter Chinese medicine. Internal prescription primarily targets the meridians of the heart, liver, and lungs, and is often combined with sedative, antipyretic and detoxicating drugs to treat stroke, infantile convulsion and angina pectoris. External prescription mainly acts on liver, heart and spleen meridian, and is often combined with drugs for clearing heat, promoting blood circulation and removing blood stasis to treat rheumatic arthralgia syndrome and sore and ulcer diseases.
