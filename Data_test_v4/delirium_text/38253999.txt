38253999|a|BACKGROUND: As societies age, increasing numbers of older adults undergo surgeries with anesthesia. Postoperative delirium (POD) and postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) frequently occur in older surgical patients. Most of these patients already have preoperative mild cognitive impairment (MCI). However, the correlation between MCI and POD remains unclear. This study aimed to determine the incidence of POD in elderly patients with and without preexisting MCI. METHODS: A prospective study enrolled patients aged 60 years and above scheduled for major surgeries between December 2017 and April 2022. Preoperative MCI was determined by a Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score between 18 and 24. POD was diagnosed using criteria from the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). POCD was characterized by a MoCA score reduction of 2 or more points from the preoperative score. The primary outcome was the incidence of POD within the first 72 h postoperatively. Secondary outcomes encompassed other postoperative complications, including POCD. RESULTS: The study comprised 223 elderly patients with MCI and 56 without MCI. The incidence of POD was 16.6% in the MCI group and 14.3% in the non-MCI group (P = 0.839). POCD occurred in 24.3% of MCI patients and 50% of non-MCI patients (P = 0.001). There were no significant differences in other postoperative complications between the groups. Postoperatively, the MCI group notably declined in visuospatial, attention, and orientation domains, while the non-MCI group declined in all domains except delayed recall. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of POD was similar in the MCI and non-MCI groups. However, the non-MCI group demonstrated a higher incidence of POCD than the MCI group. This was identified by a reduction in postoperative MoCA scores for the visuospatial, naming, attention, language, abstraction, and orientation domains. These findings underscore the importance of postoperative cognitive assessments for both elderly patients with preexisting MCI and those with previously intact cognitive functions. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial was retrospectively registered in the Thai Clinical Trials Registry on 15/01/2019 (registration number: TCTR20190115001).
