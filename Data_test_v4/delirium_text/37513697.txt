37513697|t|Shear-Viscosity-Dependent Effect of a Gum-Based Thickening Product on the Safety of Swallowing in Older Patients with Severe Oropharyngeal Dysphagia.
37513697|a|Fluid thickening is a valid therapeutic strategy for patients with oropharyngeal dysphagia (OD). The main aim of this study was to determine the therapeutic effect of the xanthan-gum-based thickener Tsururinko Quickly (TQ, Morinaga Milk Co., Tokyo, Japan) in older patients with severe OD. A total of 85 patients (83.32 +- 6.75 y) with OD and a penetration-aspiration score (PAS) of n >= 3 were studied by videofluoroscopy while swallowing duplicate 10 mL boluses at <50 mPa s, 100, 200, 400, 800, and 1600 mPa s, to assess the safety and efficacy of swallowing and the biomechanics of a swallowing response at each viscosity level. At <50 mPa s, only 16.25% patients swallowed safely, 45% had penetrations (PAS 3-5), and 38.75% had aspirations (PAS 6-8). Fluid thickening with TQ greatly increased the prevalence of patients with safe swallowing from 62.90% at 100 mPa s to 95.24% at 1600 mPa s in a shear-viscosity-dependent manner. The penetrations and aspirations were significantly reduced to 3.60% and 1.19%, respectively, at 1600 mPa s. The threshold viscosity was 100 mPa s and the increasing viscosity above 800 mPa s did not further improve the therapeutic effect significantly. Increasing the shear viscosity significantly reduced the time to laryngeal vestibule closure (-16.70%), increased the time to upper oesophageal sphincter opening (+26.88%), and reduced the pharyngeal bolus velocity (-31.62%) without affecting the pharyngeal residue. TQ has a strong shear-viscosity-dependent effect on the safety of swallowing in older patients with severe OD without increasing the pharyngeal residue. The therapeutic range for TQ is 100-800 mPa s, with 200 and 800 mPa s being the optimal doses to cover the needs of older patients with OD.
