30687918|a|INTRODUCTION: The microbiota is the set of millions of microorganisms that coexist in a symbiotic way in our body. It is mainly located in the digestive tract, being distributed in function of the chemical properties and the functions of the different organs. The factors that influence its composition are multiple (diet, individual habits, diseases or drugs). It also participates in several functions of the organism such as metabolism, immunity or even the function of the central nervous system. DEVELOPMENT: This last interrelationship is called: gut-brain axis. For years the relationship between the microbiota and the central nervous system has been known and how they influence one over the other. It is postulated that communication occurs through three systems: the vagus nerve, the systemic pathway (with the release of hormones, metabolites and neurotransmitters) and the immune system (by the action of cytokines). CONCLUSIONS: There are still many unknowns to be clarified in this field, but this microbiota-intestine-brain relationship is postulated as a possible pathogenic basis for neurological diseases of great health impact such as Alzheimer, Parkinson or multiple sclerosis. There are currently studies with probiotics with hopeful results in patients with Alzheimer's disease.
