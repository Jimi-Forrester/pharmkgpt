28863129|a|The study of different neurotrophic factors, including insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), has become relevant in recent years because of its role in brain activity and its potential therapeutic applications. This article reviews IGF-1 in relation to neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism, anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and Alzheimer's disease. An exhaustive search of different original articles, clinical, experimental, and review studies was carried out in MEDLINE/PubMed and ScienceDirect databases, selecting 80 high-impact post-2000 publications. It is concluded that despite the many functions of IGF-1 in the developing nervous system as well as in the adult brain that have been studied, especially with animal models, their role in the human brain with neuropsychiatric disorders is not completely understood, yielding contradictory data in highly prevalent disorders such as mood disorders. However, greater implications are encountered with neurodegenerative disorders. In addition, its high potential as a therapeutic resource in difficult-to-approach neuropsychiatric disorders, such as autism and Alzheimer's disease, is pointed out, but more research is needed at both basic and clinical levels, to fully understand its relevance in these disorders.
