11731015|a|The presence of the iron-binding protein lactoferrin (Lf) in some specific areas of the central nervous system and particularly in the normal human substantia nigra, where it is found in dopaminergic (DA) neurons and some glial cells, led us to investigate Lf synthesis in this area. Lf mRNA were identified using in situ hybridization and found in small ameboid cells. These cells were identified using immunocytochemistry as activated microglia since they exhibited macrophage markers such as the CD68 and the CR1 antigens. Double immunofluorescent labeling confirmed that the two Lf immunostained cell populations were activated microglia and DA neurons. Since activated microglia contained both Lf and its messenger, these cells are the Lf producing cells. The presence of Lf in DA neurons in which no Lf messengers were visible, might be due to an endocytosis mechanism, DA neurons probably internalizing Lf produced in microglial cells located in their neighborhood. In neuropathological disorders, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, inflammatory process and oxidative stress are events that contribute to neuronal death. Since Lf concentration increases during these pathologies, we studied the level of Lf expression under these different stresses and showed, using RT-PCR, that the immortalized human embryonic microglial CHME cell line produced Lf transcripts under tumor necrosis factor alpha or 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium treatment whereas untreated cells did not. These data confirm that Lf is produced only when microglia are activated.
