28569090|a|Impaired brain clearance of amyloid-beta peptides (Abeta) 40 and 42 across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is believed to be one of the pathways responsible for Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Hyperinsulinemia prevalent in type II diabetes was shown to damage cerebral vasculature and increase Abeta accumulation in AD brain. However, there is no clarity on how aberrations in peripheral insulin levels affect Abeta accumulation in the brain. This study describes, for the first time, an intricate relation between plasma insulin and Abeta transport at the BBB. Upon peripheral insulin administration in wild-type mice: the plasma clearance of Abeta40 increased, but Abeta42 clearance reduced; the plasma-to-brain influx of Abeta40 increased, and that of Abeta42 reduced; and the clearance of intracerebrally injected Abeta40 decreased, whereas Abeta42 clearance increased. In hCMEC/D3 monolayers (in vitro BBB model) exposed to insulin, the luminal uptake and luminal-to-abluminal permeability of Abeta40 increased and that of Abeta42 reduced; the abluminal-to-luminal permeability of Abeta40 decreased, whereas Abeta42 permeability increased. Moreover, Abeta cellular trafficking machinery was altered. In summary, Abeta40 and Abeta42 demonstrated distinct distribution kinetics in plasma and brain compartments, and insulin differentially modulated their distribution. Cerebrovascular disease and metabolic disorders may disrupt this intricate homeostasis and aggravate AD pathology.
