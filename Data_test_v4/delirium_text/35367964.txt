OBJECTIVE: To advance our knowledge about brain networks in AD and discover connectivity alterations during VSTMT and VAT. METHODS: Twelve participants with AD, 23 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 17 with subjective cognitive decline (SCD), and 21 healthy controls (HC) were examined using a neuropsychological battery at baseline and follow-up (three years). At baseline, the subjects were examined using high density electroencephalography while performing a VSTMT and VAT. For exploring network organization, we constructed weighted undirected networks and examined clustering coefficient, strength, and betweenness centrality from occipito-parietal regions. RESULTS: One-way ANOVA and pair-wise t-test comparisons showed statistically significant differences in HC compared to SCD (t (36) = 2.43, p = 0.026), MCI (t (42) = 2.34, p = 0.024), and AD group (t (31) = 3.58, p = 0.001) in Clustering Coefficient. Also with regards to Strength, higher values for HC compared to SCD (t (36) = 2.45, p = 0.019), MCI (t (42) = 2.41, p = 0.020), and AD group (t (31) = 3.58, p = 0.001) were found. Follow-up neuropsychological assessment revealed converge of 65% of the SCD group to MCI. Moreover, SCD who were converted to MCI showed significant lower values in all network metrics compared to the SCD that remained stable. CONCLUSION: The present findings reveal that SCD exhibits network disorganization during visual encoding and retrieval with intermediate values between MCI and HC.
