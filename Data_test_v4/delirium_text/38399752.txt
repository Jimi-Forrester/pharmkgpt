38399752|t|Unveiling the Probiotic Potential of Streptococcus thermophilus MCC0200: Insights from In Vitro Studies Corroborated with Genome Analysis.
38399752|a|Streptococcus thermophilus is widely used as a starter culture in the dairy industry and has garnered attention as a beneficial bacterium owing to its health-promoting functionalities in humans. In this study, the probiotic potential of S. thermophilus MCC0200 isolated from a dairy product was investigated through a combinatorial approach of in vitro and in silico studies. MCC0200 demonstrated the ability to survive harsh gastrointestinal (GI) transit, adhere to intestinal mucosa and exert health-promoting traits in in vitro studies. These findings were corroborated with in silico evidence, wherein, MCC0200 genome harboured genes associated with tolerance to GI conditions, intestinal adhesion and colonization. Genome mapping also highlighted the ability of MCC0200 to produce compounds advantageous for the host (folate, bacteriocins), to release antioxidant enzymes that can quench the free radicals (superoxide dismutase, NADH peroxidase), and to metabolize food components that can be harmful to sensitive people (lactose). MCC0200 also demonstrated a positive effect on reducing cholesterol levels, proving to be a potential candidate for food and pharmaceutical applications. The absence of transmissible antibiotic resistance genes and virulence genes underscored the generally regarded as safe (GRAS) nature of MCC0200. This study explored the potential of Streptococcus thermophilus for its probable applications as a probiotic beyond the dairy industry.
