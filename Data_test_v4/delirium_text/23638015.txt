23638015|a|Functional alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) do not assemble efficiently in cells transfected with alpha7 subunits unless the cells are also transfected with the chaperone protein RIC-3. Despite the presence of RIC-3, large amounts of these subunits remain improperly assembled. Thus, additional chaperone proteins are probably required for efficient assembly of alpha7 AChRs. Cholinergic ligands can act as pharmacological chaperones to promote assembly of mature AChRs and upregulate the amount of functional AChRs. In addition, we have found that the chemical chaperones 4-phenylbutyric acid (PBA) and valproic acid (VPA) greatly increase the amount of functional alpha7 AChRs produced in a cell line expressing both alpha7 and RIC-3. Increased alpha7 AChR expression allows assay of drug action using a membrane potential-sensitive fluorescent indicator. Both PBA and VPA also increase alpha7 expression in the SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line that endogenously expresses alpha7 AChRs. VPA increases expression of endogenous alpha7 AChRs in hippocampal neurons but PBA does not. RIC-3 is insufficient for optimal assembly of alpha7 AChRs, but provides assay conditions for detecting additional chaperones. Chemical chaperones are a useful pragmatic approach to express high levels of human alpha7 AChRs for drug selection and characterization and possibly to increase alpha7 expression in vivo.
