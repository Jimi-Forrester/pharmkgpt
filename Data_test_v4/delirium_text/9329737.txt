9329737|a|These results demonstrate that early alterations in the BBB may underlie selective vulnerability in this model of chronic reduced oxidative metabolism. Changes in the BBB (IgG extravasation) precede alterations in APP processing and cell death. Since thiamine-dependent enzymes are also reduced in the brain in Alzheimer's disease, similar processes may be important in the pathophysiology of the disease.
