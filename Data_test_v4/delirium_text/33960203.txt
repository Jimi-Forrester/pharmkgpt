33960203|a|Background: Alzheimer's disease is a multifactorial neurological disorder seen in elderly people. Loss of cholinergic transmission and unbalanced tryptophan metabolism kynurenine pathway have been demonstrated in neuropsychiatric diseases. Methods & results: Among the two series of synthesized compounds, compounds 5c and 5h were identified as effective dual BChE/IDO1 inhibitors, with well-balanced micromolar activity. Compounds 5c and 5h exhibited promising ability to ameliorate behavioral impairment by Morris water maze. The safety of miconazole analogs was also validated by PC12 and SH-SY5Y cell lines. Conclusion: These results highlight the ability of 5c and 5h to treat Alzheimer's disease.
