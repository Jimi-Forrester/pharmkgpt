38600212|a|To maintain current cognitive function and access greater cognitive reserves, nonpharmacological interventions may be a viable alternative for older adults with or without cognitive impairment. This study aimed to compare different nonpharmacological interventions for enhancing global cognition, including mind-body exercise, physical exercise, non-invasive brain stimulation, cognitive training intervention (CTI), acutherapy (ACU), meditation, and music therapy, by applying a network meta-analysis (NMA). Sixty-one randomized controlled trials evaluating the efficacy of interventions on global cognition in older adults with or without mild cognitive decline were selected. An NMA was conducted to compare the efficacy of different nonpharmacological interventions. The NMA revealed that mind-body exercise (standardized mean difference, 1.384; 95% confidence interval, 0.777-1.992); ACU (1.283; 0.478-2.088); meditation (0.910; 0.097-1.724); non-invasive brain stimulation (1.242; 0.254-2.230); CTI (1.269; 0.736-1.802); and physical exercise (0.977; 0.212-1.742), showed positive effects compared to passive controls. There were no significant differences between the efficacies of other interventions. Nonpharmacological interventions may potentially enhance and maintain global cognition through various pathways, such as memorizing movements and enhancing brain plasticity by reducing stress in the older adult population. Additional studies are needed to clarify the impact of other variables, including intervention methods or psychological variables.
