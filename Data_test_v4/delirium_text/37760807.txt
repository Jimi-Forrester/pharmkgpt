37760807|t|P300 Event-Related Potential Predicts Cognitive Dysfunction in Patients with Vestibular Disorders.
37760807|a|OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to determine the correlation between cognitive impairment and P300 event-related potential (ERP) in older adults with vertigo and imbalance, which further provides a reference for clinical diagnosis and patients' rehabilitation. METHODS: A total of 79 older adult patients with vertigo and imbalance in our outpatient department from January 2022 to December 2022 were selected and divided into the mild group (n = 20), moderate group (n = 39), and severe group (n = 20) according to the Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI). The auditory P300 component of event-related potentials (ERPs), Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire-7 (GAD-7), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) were used to evaluate depression, anxiety, and cognitive function in these patients, respectively. RESULTS: The P300 latencies of the different severity groups were 292 +- 10 ms, 301 +- 8 ms, and 328 +- 5 ms, respectively, and the differences were statistically significant (p = 0.010). The P300 amplitudes of the different severity groups were 14.4 +- 2.6 muV, 3.9 +- 0.8 muV, and 5.1 +- 1.4 muV, respectively, and the differences were also statistically significant (p = 0.004). There was no statistically significant difference in the DHI evaluation or VAS visual simulation scoring between the two groups (p = 0.625, and 0.878, respectively). Compared with the short-course group, the long-course group showed prolonged P300 latency and decreased amplitude, higher scores in PHQ-9 and GAD-7, and lower scores in MMSE, and all the differences were statistically significant (p = 0.013, 0.021, 0.006, 0.004, and 0.018, respectively). CONCLUSION: Older patients with more severe symptoms of vertigo and imbalance are at higher risk of developing abnormal cognitive function. The P300 can be used as an objective neurophysiological test for the assessment of cognitive function relevant to elderly patients with vertigo and imbalance.
