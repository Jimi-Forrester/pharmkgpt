37977873|t|Postoperative stellate ganglion block to reduce myocardial injury after laparoscopic radical resection for colorectal cancer: protocol for a randomised trial.
37977873|a|INTRODUCTION: Stellate ganglion block (SGB) is usually used in the department of algiatry. But preoperative SGB may reduce adverse cardiovascular events in high-risk patients, although evidence remains sparse. Therefore, we aim to determine whether a single-shot postoperative SGB can reduce the incidence of myocardial injury after non-cardiac surgery (MINS) and improve recovery in patients undergoing laparoscopic radical resection for colorectal cancer. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is an investigator-initiated, single-centre, randomised, two-arm clinical trial enrolling patients aged over 45 years and scheduled for elective laparoscopic radical colorectal surgery with at least one risk factor for MINS. A total of 950 eligible patients will be randomised into a routine or block groups. The primary outcome is the incidence of MINS. The secondary outcomes include the Visual Analogue Scale of pain during rest and movement, the incidence of delirium, quality of recovery (QOR) assessed by QOR-15, and sleep quality assessed by Richards Campbell Sleep Questionnaire. Tertiary outcomes include time to first flatus, gastrointestinal complications such as anastomotic leak or ileus, length of hospital stay, collapse incidence of severe cardiovascular and cerebrovascular complications of myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke, and all-cause mortality within 30 days after the operation. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The protocol was approved by Medical Ethics Committee of the China-Japan Union Hospital, Jilin University (Approval number: 2021081018) prior to recruitment. The study will be performed according to the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki. The findings of this study will be published and presented through various scientific forums. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ChiCTR2200055319.
