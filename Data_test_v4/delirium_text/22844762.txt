22844762|a|Fifty-eight patients who visited the emergency room of our center with febrile convulsions and impaired consciousness, and underwent paperless electroencephalography soon after arrival. They consisted of 25 male and 33 female children, ranging in age from 5 months to 15 years and 4 months, with a mean age of 4 years and 10 months. The final diagnoses were poor responsiveness associated with fever and febrile delirium in 5 patients, febrile convulsions in 26, encephalitis/encephalopathy in 24, convulsions associated with mild gastroenteritis in 2, and aseptic meningitis in 1. The appearance of spindle wave within 24 hours after admission was considered to be a favorable prognostic factor, whereas generalized high-amplitude delta waves without fast-wave components and dysrhythmic flat basic waves were considered poor prognostic factors. We conclude that bed-side paperless electroencephalography is useful for the evaluation of changes in the brain function and course of treatment.
