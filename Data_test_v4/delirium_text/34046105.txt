34046105|t|Heart, Eye, and Artificial Intelligence: A Review.
34046105|a|Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in the USA. Deep learning-based artificial intelligence (AI) methods have become increasingly common in studying the various factors involved in cardiovascular disease. The usage of retinal scanning techniques to diagnose retinal diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma and others, using fundus photographs and optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) has been extensively documented. Researchers are now looking to combine the power of AI with the non-invasive ease of retinal scanning to examine the workings of the heart and predict changes in the macrovasculature based on microvascular features and function. In this review, we summarize the current state of the field in using retinal imaging to diagnose cardiovascular issues and other diseases.
