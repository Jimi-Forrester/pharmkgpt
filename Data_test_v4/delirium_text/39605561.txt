39605561|a|Disrupted lipid homeostasis and neuroinflammation often co-exist in neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the intrinsic connection and causal relationship between these deficits remain elusive. Our previous studies show that the loss of sulfatide (ST), a class of myelin-enriched lipids, causes AD-like neuroinflammatory responses, cognitive impairment, bladder enlargement, as well as lipid dyshomeostasis. To better understand the relationship between neuroinflammation and lipid disruption induced by ST deficiency, we established a ST-deficient mouse model with constitutive Trem2 knockout and studied the impact of Trem2 in regulating ST deficiency-induced microglia-mediated neuroinflammation, astrocyte activation and lipid disruption. Our study demonstrates that Trem2 regulates ST deficiency-induced microglia-mediated neuroinflammatory pathways and astrogliosis at the transcriptomic level, but not astrocyte activation at the protein level, suggesting that Trem2 is indispensable for ST deficiency-induced microglia-mediated neuroinflammation but not astrogliosis. Meanwhile, ST loss-induced lipidome disruption and free water retention were consistently observed in the absence of Trem2 . Collectively, these results emphasize the essential role of Trem2 in mediating lipid loss-associated microglia-mediated neuroinflammation, but not both astrogliosis and myelin lipid disruption. Moreover, we demonstrated that attenuating neuroinflammation has a limited impact on brain ST loss-induced lipidome alteration or AD-like peripheral disorders. Our findings suggest that preserving lipidome and astrocyte balance may be crucial in decelerating the progression of AD.
