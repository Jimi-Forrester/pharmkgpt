36741794|t|Reversible Psychosis Caused by Disconnection of the Limbic System: Clinical Reasoning Using Diffusion Tensor Tractography.
36741794|a|Injury to the limbic system can result in amnesia, language difficulties, behavioral abnormalities, and psychological disorders. We present a patient who suffered psychosis related to disconnection of the limbic system after intraventricular and orbitofrontal hemorrhages following removal of a sellar meningioma. Diffusion tensor tractography was valuable for evaluating the structural integrity of the injured limbic tracts and determining the regeneration of tracts corresponding to neuropsychiatric recovery after cognitive rehabilitation.
