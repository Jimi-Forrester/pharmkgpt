1518285|t|Managing agitation in the critical care setting.
1518285|a|Pharmacologic control of the agitated ICU patient requires preliminary assessment of the underlying causes of agitation. Reversal of correctable abnormalities, consideration of drug reaction, withdrawal and pain management should be addressed first. Delirium is the most common cause of agitation in the ICU and often has multiple causes. Pharmacologic management of agitation can be safely accomplished by intravenous haloperidol with or without lorazepam, as outlined above.
