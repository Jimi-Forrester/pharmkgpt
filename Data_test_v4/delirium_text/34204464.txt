34204464|t|Acute Movement Disorders in Childhood.
34204464|a|Acute-onset movement disorders (MDs) are an increasingly recognized neurological emergency in both adults and children. The spectrum of possible causes is wide, and diagnostic work-up is challenging. In their acute presentation, MDs may represent the prominent symptom or an important diagnostic clue in a broader constellation of neurological and extraneurological signs. The diagnostic approach relies on the definition of the overall clinical syndrome and on the recognition of the prominent MD phenomenology. The recognition of the underlying disorder is crucial since many causes are treatable. In this review, we summarize common and uncommon causes of acute-onset movement disorders, focusing on clinical presentation and appropriate diagnostic investigations. Both acquired (immune-mediated, infectious, vascular, toxic, metabolic) and genetic disorders causing acute MDs are reviewed, in order to provide a useful clinician's guide to this expanding field of pediatric neurology.
