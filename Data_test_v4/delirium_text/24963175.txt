24963175|a|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Several changes in the management protocols of anaesthesia for geriatric patients were introduced into clinical practice to improve the outcome. Very few studies have evaluated the impact of these management protocols. The aim of our study was to evaluate impact of some of the changes in the peri-operative management protocols of geriatric patients undergoing elective orthopaedic lower limb surgeries on the outcomes. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of thirty-eight surgical patients from 1999 (Group 1999) before the introduction of changes and 107 patients from 2007 (Group 2007) after establishing changes was performed and data of peri-operative variables were collected and analysed. The primary outcome measured was in-hospital mortality. The secondary outcomes were occurrence of intra-operative and post-operative complications. Comparison of continuous variables between the two groups was performed using independent sample T test and categorical variables using Chi-square test. Multivariate logistic regression was done to identify independent predictors of mortality. RESULTS: The use of beta blockers, deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin and epidural technique for post-operative analgesia was higher in group 2007. Despite higher prevalence of patients with electrocardiographic changes and anaemia, the incidence of intra-operative or post-operative complications was lower in 2007, though the mortality rate in both the groups was comparable. The independent risk factors for mortality in these geriatric patients were intra-operative hypotension (Odds Ratio (OR) =11.33) and post-operative myocardial ischaemia (OR = 34.5), pulmonary embolism (OR = 17.1) and neurologic changes (OR = 17.1). CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of new management practices had significantly reduced the incidence of intra- and post-operative complications.
