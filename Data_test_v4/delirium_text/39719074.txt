39719074|a|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate characteristics and outcomes in critically ill patients with Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS). METHODS: Consecutive adults with GBS who required intensive care unit (ICU) admission at a tertiary-care hospital between 1999 and 2020 were enrolled into this retrospective cohort study. Demographics, clinical data and patient outcomes were compared between patients who did or did not receive mechanical ventilation (MV). RESULTS: During the study period, the number of ICU admissions gradually rose from approximately 900 to 3000 annually. Forty-three patients had GBS and were included, of whom, 27 (62.8%) received MV for a median of 13 days. The MV group stayed longer in the ICU (median, 26 versus 6 days) and in the hospital (median, 120 versus 39 days) than the non-MV group. Most patients in the MV group (22 [81.5%]) required tracheostomy. At maximum follow-up, Hughes Functional Grading scores were 0 (full recovery) in 11 patients (25.5%), 1-3 in 18 (41.8%), 4-5 in 12 (27.9%), and 6 (death) in two (4.6%, both in the MV group), with higher median Hughes score in the MV group (3 versus 0.5). Complications during ICU and hospital stay included: veinous thromboembolism in five (11.6%), gastrointestinal bleeding in three (7.0%), bacteremia in five (11.6%), bedsore in one (2.3%), and GBS-treatment side effects in four (9.4%) patients; all of these complications occurred within the MV group. CONCLUSIONS: GBS was an uncommon reason for ICU admission. The findings highlight significant morbidity with GBS, particularly among patients who need MV.
