23112420|a|AIM: Scopolamine is known to produce amnesia due to blockade of the cholinergic neurotransmission. The present study investigated the potential of Convolvulus pluricaulis (CP) to attenuate scopolamine (2 mg/kg, i.p) induced increased protein and mRNA levels of tau, amyloid precursor protein (AbetaPP), amyloid beta (Abeta) levels and histopathological changes in rat cerebral cortex. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was conducted on male Wistar rats (250 +- 20 g) divided into four groups of eight animals each. Groups 1 and 2 served as controls receiving normal saline and scopolamine for 4 weeks, respectively. Group 3 received rivastigmine (standard) and group 4 received aqueous extract of CP simultaneously with scopolamine. Western blot and RT-PCR analysis were used to evaluate the levels of protein and mRNA of amyloid precursor protein (AbetaPP) and tau in rat cortex and ELISA was used to measure the amyloid beta (Abeta) levels. Histopathology was also performed on cortical section of all groups. RESULT: Oral administration of CP extract (150 mg/kg) to scopolamine treated rats reduced the increased protein and mRNA levels of tau and AbetaPP levels followed by reduction in Abeta levels compared with scopolamine treated group. The potential of extract to prevent scopolamine neurotoxicity was reflected at the microscopic level as well, indicative of its neuroprotective effects. CONCLUSION: CP treatment alleviated neurotoxic effect of scopolamine reflects its potential as potent neuroprotective agent.
