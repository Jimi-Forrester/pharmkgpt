39531077|a|PURPOSE: Although neuropathological comorbidities, including Alzheimer's disease neuropathological change (AD-NC) and limbic-predominant age-related TAR DNA-binding protein 43encephalopathy neuropathological change (LATE-NC), are associated with medial temporal atrophy in patients with Lewy body disease (LBD), the diagnostic performance of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-derived indices remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the diagnostic performance of MRI-derived indices representing medial temporal atrophy in differentiating between LBD with AD-NC and/or LATE-NC (mixed LBD [mLBD]) and without these comorbidities (pure LBD [pLBD]). METHODS: This study included 24 and 16 patients with pathologically confirmed mLBD and pLBD, respectively. In addition to the well-known medial temporal atrophy and entorhinal cortex atrophy (ERICA) scores, the cross-sectional areas of the bilateral entorhinal cortices/parahippocampal gyri (ABEP) were segmented manually. RESULTS: Even incorporating various covariates such as age at MRI examination, sex, argyrophilic grain, the MRI-derived indices, especially ABEP, significantly correlated with the severity of AD-NC, and showed a trend of correlation with LATE-NC. For the differentiation between all mLBD and pLBD, the ERICA score and ABEP demonstrated higher diagnostic performance (area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve [AUC] of 0.80 and 0.87, respectively). Additionally, the highest diagnostic performance for ABEP (AUC, 0.94; sensitivity, 100%; specificity, 88.9%; accuracy, 96%) was observed in differentiating between pLBD and mLBD with two comorbidities (AD-NC and LATE-NC). CONCLUSION: In patients with pathologically confirmed LBD, medial temporal atrophy was significantly correlated with AD-NC, and showed a trend of correlation with LATE-NC. Moreover, MRI-derived indices indicative of medial temporal atrophy were useful in diagnosing these comorbidities.
