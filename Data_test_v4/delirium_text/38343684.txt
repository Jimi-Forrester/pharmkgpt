38343684|a|Background and Aims: Serratus posterior superior intercostal plane block (SPSIPB) is a novel technique that can provide analgesia in the hemithorax, shoulder, and back of the neck. This study aimed to evaluate the post-operative analgesic effect of SPSIPB in patients undergoing video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). Methods: It is a double-blind, randomised controlled trial. Twenty-four adult patients who underwent VATS via the uniportal technique were randomised into two groups: the SPSIPB group (n = 12) received SPSIPB along with intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) with tramadol, whereas the control group (n = 12) received only PCA with tramadol. At the end of the surgery, patients in the SPSIPB group received a unilateral SPSIPB under ultrasound guidance with the use of 30-mL bupivacaine 0.25%. The primary outcome was the numerical rating scale (NRS) scores of the patients. Secondary outcomes included the amount of tramadol and rescue analgesic (paracetamol) consumed by the patients, followed up for post-operative 24 hours. Categorical variables were compared using the Chi-Square Test. Mann-Whitney U Test was used to compare groups of variables that were not normally distributed. Results: The SPSIPB group had lower NRS values during post-operative 24 hours (P < 0.001). Mean (standard deviation) total tramadol consumption was 58.33 (26.23) mg in the SPSIPB group and 144.17 (13.11) mg in the control group (P < 0.001). Rescue analgesic need was lower in the SPSIP group in the first 18 post-operative hours (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Serratus posterior superior intercostal plane block provides good analgesia in the thoracic region after video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery.
