38463115|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a serious health issue that has a significant social and economic impact worldwide. One of the key aetiological signs of the disease is a gradual reduction in cognitive function and irreversible neuronal death. According to a 2019 global report, more than 5.8 million people in the United States (USA) alone have received an AD diagnosis, with 45% of those people falling into the 75-84 years age range. According to the predictions, there will be 15 million affected people in the USA by 2050 due to the disease's steadily rising patient population. Cognitive function and memory formation steadily decline as a result of an irreversible neuron loss in AD, a chronic neurodegenerative illness. Amyloid-beta and phosphorylated Tau are produced and accumulate in large amounts, and glial cells are overactive. Additionally, weakened neurotrophin signalling and decreased synapse function are crucial aspects of AD. Memory loss, apathy, depression, and irritability are among the primary symptoms. The aetiology, pathophysiology, and causes of both cognitive decline and synaptic dysfunction are poorly understood despite extensive investigation. CRISPR/Cas9 is a promising gene-editing technique since it can fix certain gene sequences and has a lot of potential for treating AD and other human disorders. Regardless of hereditary considerations, an altered Abeta metabolism is frequently seen in familial and sporadic AD. Therefore, since mutations in the PSEN-1, PSEN-2 and APP genes are a contributing factor to familial AD, CRISPR/Cas9 technology could address excessive Abeta production or mutations in these genes. Overall, the potential of CRISPR-Cas9 technology outweighs it as currently the greatest gene-editing tool available for researching neurodegenerative diseases like AD.
