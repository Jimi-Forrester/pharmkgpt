21698700|t|Possible role for Ca2+ in the pathophysiology of the prion protein?
21698700|a|Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, or prion diseases, are lethal neurodegenerative disorders caused by the infectious agent named prion, whose main constituent is an aberrant conformational isoform of the cellular prion protein, PrP(C) . The mechanisms of prion-associated neurodegeneration and the physiologic function of PrP(C) are still unclear, although it is now increasingly acknowledged that PrP(C) plays a role in cell differentiation and survival. PrP(C) thus exhibits dichotomic attributes, as it can switch from a benign function under normal conditions to the triggering of neuronal death during disease. By reviewing data from models of prion infection and PrP-knockout paradigms, here we discuss the possibility that Ca(2+) is the hidden factor behind the multifaceted behavior of PrP(C) . By featuring in almost all processes of cell signaling, Ca(2+) might explain diverse aspects of PrP(C) pathophysiology, including the recently proposed one in which PrP(C) acts as a mediator of synaptic degeneration in Alzheimer's disease.
