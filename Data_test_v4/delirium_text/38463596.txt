38463596|a|OBJECTIVES: This meta-analysis aimed to investigate the correlation between plasma biomarkers, such as albumin and fibrinogen, and their ratio with postoperative delirium (POD) in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery. METHODS: Relevant observational cohort studies were systematically searched in PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library databases as of March 2023. This meta-analysis was conducted using RevMan 5.4.1 and Stata 15.0 software. For continuous variables with non-uniform units, the standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used; otherwise, the mean difference (MD) and 95% CIs were employed. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) was applied to assess the quality of included literature. RESULTS: Eighteen studies encompassing 7,011 patients were included. The meta-analysis revealed significantly lower albumin levels (sixteen studies, 5,813 patients, SMD = -0.45, 95% CI = -0.64 to -0.26, P < 0.00001, I2 = 80%) and albumin-fibrinogen ratio (AFR) (four studies, 824 patients, MD = -0.62, 95% CI = -0.76 to -0.48, P = 0.56, I2 = 0%) in the delirious group. Conversely, higher fibrinogen concentrations (two studies, 441 patients, MD = 0.13, 95% CI = 0.02 to 0.24, P = 0.69, I2 = 0%) were observed in the delirious group. Due to high heterogeneity in albumin levels (P < 0.00001, I2 = 80%), we conducted a subgroup and sensitivity analysis, and confirmed that the association of albumin levels was not influenced by surgery type, design or delirium evaluation instruments. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative albumin, fibrinogen and AFR levels were associated with POD, potentially aiding in identifying high-risk patients and playing a key role in preventing POD.
