24665599|a|Cognitive disorders (CD) of variable severity are currently one of the leading causes of disability in the patients presenting with vascular and degenerative diseases of the brain; it is especially true of Alzheimer's disease. The discovery of the universal pathogenetic mechanism underlying the development of CD made it possible to explain the known cases of the successful application of acupuncture in the patients with disorders of seemingly different origin. The results of these studies suggest that acupuncture can affect the key pathogenetic "functional circles" involved in the development of CD. The present article is focused on the description of the humoral, neurotransmitter and electrophysiological mechanisms through which the positive effects of acupuncture on the cognitive function of the patients with various diseases are mediated.
