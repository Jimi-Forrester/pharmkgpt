25746773|a|Neurofibrillary tangles (aggregates of cytoskeletal Tau protein) and senile plaques (aggregates mainly formed by amyloid beta peptide) are two landmark lesions in Alzheimer s disease. Some researchers have proposed tangles, whereas others have proposed plaques, as primary lesions. For a long time, these were thought of as independent mechanisms. However, experimental evidence suggests that both lesions are intimately related. We review here some molecular pathways linking amyloid beta and Tau toxicities involving, among others, glycogen synthase kinase 3beta, p38, Pin1, cyclin-dependent kinase 5, and regulator of calcineurin 1. Understanding amyloid beta and Tau toxicities as part of a common pathophysiological mechanism may help to find molecular targets to prevent or even treat the disease.
