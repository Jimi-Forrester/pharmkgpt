38597140|t|Fatigue, fear of being mobilized and residual limb pain limit independent basic mobility and physiotherapy for patients early after major dysvascular lower extremity amputation: A prospective cohort study.
38597140|a|AIM: Early mobilization of patients with a major lower extremity amputation (LEA) is often a challenge because of lack of compliance. Therefore, we investigated factors limiting independent mobility and physiotherapy on the first day with physiotherapy (PTDay1) and the following 2 days after LEA. METHODS: A total of 60 consecutive patients, mean age 73.7 years (SD 12.1 years), undergoing LEA were included over a period of 7 months. The Basic Amputee Mobility Score was used to assess basic mobility. Predefined limitations for not achieving independent mobility or not completing physiotherapy were residual limb pain, pain elsewhere, fear of being mobilized, fatigue, nausea/vomiting, acute cognitive dysfunction or "other" factors reported on PTDay1 and the following 2 days after LEA. RESULTS: Fatigue and fear of being mobilized were the most frequent limitations for not achieving independent mobility on PTDay1 and the following 2 days after LEA. Patients (n = 55) who were not independent in the Basic Amputee Mobility Score activity transferring from bed to chair on PTDay1 were limited by fatigue (44%) and fear of being mobilized (33%). A total of 21 patients did not complete planned physiotherapy on PTDay1, and were limited by fatigue (38%), residual limb pain (24%) and "other" factors (24%). CONCLUSION: Fatigue and fear of being mobilized were the most frequent factors that limited independent mobility early after LEA. Fatigue, residual limb pain and "other" factors limited completion of physiotherapy. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2024;   :   -  .
