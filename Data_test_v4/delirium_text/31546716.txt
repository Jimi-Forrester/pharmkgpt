31546716|a|Manganese (Mn) is an essential trace element that is naturally found in the environment and is necessary as a cofactor for many enzymes and is important in several physiological processes that support development, growth, and neuronal function. However, overexposure to Mn may induce neurotoxicity and may contribute to the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). The present review aims to provide new insights into the involvement of Mn in the etiology of AD and PD. Here, we discuss the critical role of Mn in the etiology of these disorders and provide a summary of the proposed mechanisms underlying Mn-induced neurodegeneration. In addition, we review some new therapy options for AD and PD related to Mn overload.
