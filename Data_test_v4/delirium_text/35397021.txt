35397021|a|The antagonistic side effects of chemical medications led to the search for safe strategies such as biogenic agents. Correspondingly, this study aims to create biogenic, appropriate, auspicious and innovative therapeutic agents like Galaxaura elongata {GE}, Turbinaria ornata {TO} and Enteromorpha flexuosa {EF} macroalgae-based silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs). The Ag+ reduction and the creation of Ag[GE]-NPs, Ag[TO]-NPs and Ag[EF]-NPs have been validated using UV-visible spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and zeta potential analysis, and the chemical composition of macroalgae crude extracts was estimated through gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Further, macroalgae-based Ag-NPs were tested for their free radical scavenging activity DPPH, ABTS, anticancer activity in human liver carcinoma (HepG2) cell line, distinctive inflammation forms and elevated alpha-amylase. Results showed that the biosynthesized Ag-NPs have unique mechanical and physicochemical characters attributed to their high relative surface area, nanosized dimensions and spherical shape. At dose of 200 microg/mL, the DPPH radical scavenging capacity was maximized with Ag[TO]-NPs (67.26%); however, Ag[EF]-NPs was the most potent as ABTs scavenger (97.74%). Additionally, Ag[GE]-NPs had the maximum proteinase inhibitory action with 59.78%. The 1000 microg/mL of Ag[GE]-NPs, Ag[TO]-NPs and Ag[EF]-NPs revealed significant inhibitions of cell growth of HepG2 resulting in cell viabilities 5.92%, 4.44% and 11.33%, respectively. These findings suggest that macroalgae bio-capped Ag-NPs have magnificent biological potentials for safe biomedical applications.
