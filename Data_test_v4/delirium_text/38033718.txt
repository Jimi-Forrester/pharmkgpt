38033718|t|SmartWear body sensors for neurological and neurosurgical patients: A review of current and future technologies.
38033718|a|Background/objective: Recent technological advances have allowed for the development of smart wearable devices (SmartWear) which can be used to monitor various aspects of patient healthcare. These devices provide clinicians with continuous biometric data collection for patients in both inpatient and outpatient settings. Although these devices have been widely used in fields such as cardiology and orthopedics, their use in the field of neurosurgery and neurology remains in its infancy. Methods: A comprehensive literature search for the current and future applications of SmartWear devices in the above conditions was conducted, focusing on outpatient monitoring. Findings: Through the integration of sensors which measure parameters such as physical activity, hemodynamic variables, and electrical conductivity - these devices have been applied to patient populations such as those at risk for stroke, suffering from epilepsy, with neurodegenerative disease, with spinal cord injury and/or recovering from neurosurgical procedures. Further, these devices are being tested in various clinical trials and there is a demonstrated interest in the development of new technologies. Conclusion: This review provides an in-depth evaluation of the use of SmartWear in selected neurological diseases and neurosurgical applications. It is clear that these devices have demonstrated efficacy in a variety of neurological and neurosurgical applications, however challenges such as data privacy and management must be addressed.
