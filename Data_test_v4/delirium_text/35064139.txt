35064139|a|Accumulation of phosphorylated alpha-synuclein aggregates has been implicated in several diseases, such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and is thought to spread in a prion-like manner. Elucidating the mechanisms of prion-like transmission of alpha-synuclein is important for the development of therapies for these diseases, but little is known about the details. Here, we injected alpha-synuclein fibrils into the brains of wild-type mice and examined the early phase of the induction of phosphorylated alpha-synuclein accumulation. We found that phosphorylated alpha-synuclein appeared within a few days after the intracerebral injection. It was observed initially in presynaptic regions and subsequently extended its localization to axons and cell bodies. These results suggest that extracellular alpha-synuclein fibrils are taken up into the presynaptic region and seed-dependently convert the endogenous normal alpha-synuclein that is abundant there to an abnormal phosphorylated form, which is then transported through the axon to the cell body.
