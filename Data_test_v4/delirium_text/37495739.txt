37495739|a|End-of-life patients with cancer may find expressing their symptoms difficult if they can no longer communicate verbally because of deteriorating health. In this study, we assessed these symptoms using machine learning, which has excellent predictive capabilities and has recently been applied in healthcare. We performed a retrospective clinical survey involving 213 patients with cancer from August 2015 to August 2016. We divided the reported symptoms into two groups-visible and nonvisible symptoms. We used decision tree analysis, an analytical machine learning method that organizes and analyzes information in the form of a tree diagram to visually represent the information structure. Our machine learning model used patient background data and visible symptoms to predict nonvisible symptoms: pain, dyspnea, fatigue, drowsiness, anxiety, delirium, inadequate informed consent, and spiritual issues. The highest and/or lowest values for prediction accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were 88.0%/55.5%, 84.9%/3.3%, and 96.7%/24.1%, respectively. This work will facilitate better assessment and management of symptoms in patients with cancer. This study was the first to predict nonvisible symptoms using decision tree analyses for patients with cancer receiving palliative care. Notably, applications based on our results may assess symptoms to the same extent as healthcare professionals.
