38521993|t|Shared and differing functional connectivity abnormalities of the default mode network in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease.
38521993|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) both show abnormal resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) of default mode network (DMN), but it is unclear to what extent these abnormalities are shared. Therefore, we performed a comprehensive meta-analysis, including 31 MCI studies and 20 AD studies. MCI patients, compared to controls, showed decreased within-DMN rsFC in bilateral medial prefrontal cortex/anterior cingulate cortex (mPFC/ACC), precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), right temporal lobes, and left angular gyrus and increased rsFC between DMN and left inferior temporal gyrus. AD patients, compared to controls, showed decreased rsFC within DMN in bilateral mPFC/ACC and precuneus/PCC and between DMN and left inferior occipital gyrus and increased rsFC between DMN and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Conjunction analysis showed shared decreased rsFC in mPFC/ACC and precuneus/PCC. Compared to MCI, AD had decreased rsFC in left precuneus/PCC and between DMN and left inferior occipital gyrus and increased rsFC in right temporal lobes. MCI and AD share a decreased within-DMN rsFC likely underpinning episodic memory deficits and neuropsychiatric symptoms, but differ in DMN rsFC alterations likely related to impairments in other cognitive domains such as language, vision, and execution. This may throw light on neuropathological mechanisms in these two stages of dementia.
