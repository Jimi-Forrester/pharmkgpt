39861466|t|Dietary Intake, Mediterranean and Nordic Diet Adherence in Alzheimer's Disease and Dementia: A Systematic Review.
39861466|a|BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Dementia is not a single disease but an umbrella term that encompasses a range of symptoms, such as memory loss and cognitive impairments, which are severe enough to disrupt daily life. One of the most common forms of dementia is Alzheimer's Disease (AD), a complex neurodegenerative condition influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Recent research has highlighted diet as a potential modifiable risk factor for AD. Decades of research have explored the role of dietary patterns, including the Mediterranean Diet (MD) and its components, in neuroprotection and cognitive health. Systematic review examines studies investigating the impact of the Mediterranean Diet, Mediterranean-like diets, the Nordic Diet (ND), dietary intake patterns, and specific components such as extra virgin olive oil and rapeseed oil on cognitive function, disease onset, and progression in AD and dementia. METHODS: A comprehensive search of PubMed, the Directory of Open Access Journals, and the Social Science Research Network was conducted independently by two reviewers using predefined search terms. The search period included studies from 2006 to 2024. Eligible studies meeting the inclusion criteria were systematically reviewed, yielding 88 studies: 85 focused on the MD and its relationship to AD and dementia, while only 3 investigated the ND. RESULTS: The findings suggest that adherence to the Mediterranean and Nordic diets is generally associated with improved cognitive function and delayed cognitive decline and that adherence to both these diets can improve cognitive function. Some studies identified that higher legume consumption decreased dementia incidence, while fruits and vegetables, carbohydrates, and eggs lowered dementia prevalence. Most studies demonstrated that high MD or ND adherence was associated with better cognitive function and a lower risk of poor cognition in comparison to individuals with lower MD or ND adherence. However, some studies reported no significant benefits of the MD on cognitive outcomes, while two studies indicated that higher red meat consumption was linked to better cognitive function. CONCLUSION: Despite promising trends, the evidence remains varying across studies, underscoring the need for further research to establish definitive associations between diet and cognitive function. These findings highlight the essential role of dietary interventions in the prevention and management of dementia and AD, therefore offering critical insights into the underlying mechanisms by which the diet may impact brain health.
