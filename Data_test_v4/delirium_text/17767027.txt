17767027|a|The effects of androgen replacement therapy on brain function were reviewed focusing on cognitive function and depressive state. Testosterone replacement improved spatial cognition aside from estradiol converted from testosterone in the brain in elderly men, and also improved spatial memory of the patients with Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment. Testosterone supplementation improved depressive state induced by hypogonadism as well as depressive disorder. Furthermore, two recent studies showed that testosterone activated ventral stream related to the processing of form and color and midbrain, superior frontal gyrus and dorsal anterior cingulate gyrus along with the improvement of cognitive and sexual function, which can have a positive effect on depressive state.
