33308129|a|BACKGROUND: It has been found that there is a link between hypertension and elevated risk of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Herein, a meta-analysis based on Randomized Clinical Trials (RCTs) was used to assess the effect of antihypertensive drugs on cognition and behavioral symptoms of AD patients. METHODS: The three databases, PubMed/Medline, Scopus, and Cochrane Library, were searched up to March 2020. The quality of the studies included in the meta-analysis was evaluated by the Jadad score. Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIC) included in two studies, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) included in three studies, and Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) in three studies were the main outcomes in this systematic review. RESULTS: Out of 1506 studies retrieved in the databases, 5 RCTs were included and analyzed in the meta-analysis. The pooled mean differences of CGIC, MMSE, and NPI in patients with AD receiving antihypertensive drugs compared to placebo were -1.76 with (95% CI = -2.66 to -0.86; P=0.0001), 0.74 (95% CI = 0.20 to 1.28; P= 0.007), and -9.49 (95% CI = -19.76 to 0.79; P = 0.07), respectively. CONCLUSION: The findings of the present meta-analysis show that antihypertensive drugs may improve cognition and behavioral symptoms of patients with AD. However, more well-designed RCTs with similar drugs are needed to achieve more conclusive results.
