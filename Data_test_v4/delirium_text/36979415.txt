36979415|t|Expression Mapping and Functional Analysis of Orphan G-Protein-Coupled Receptor GPR158 in the Adult Mouse Brain Using a GPR158 Transgenic Mouse.
36979415|a|Aberrant expression of G-protein-coupled receptor 158 (GPR158) has been reported to be inextricably linked to a variety of diseases affecting the central nervous system, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), depression, intraocular pressure, and glioma, but the underlying mechanism remains elusive due to a lack of biological and pharmacological tools to elaborate its preferential cellular distribution and molecular interaction network. To assess the cellular localization, expression, and function of GPR158, we generated an epitope-tagged GPR158 mouse model (GPR158Tag) that exhibited normal motor, cognitive, and social behavior, no deficiencies in social memory, and no anxiety-like behavior compared to C57BL/6J control mice at P60. Using immunofluorescence, we found that GPR158+ cells were distributed in several brain regions including the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum, and caudate putamen. Next, using the cerebral cortex of the adult GPR158Tag mice as a representative region, we found that GPR158 was only expressed in neurons, and not in microglia, oligodendrocytes, or astrocytes. Remarkably, the majority of GPR158 was enriched in Camk2a+ neurons whilst limited expression was found in PV+ interneurons. Concomitant 3D co-localization analysis revealed that GPR158 was mainly distributed in the postsynaptic membrane, but with a small portion in the presynaptic membrane. Lastly, via mass spectrometry analysis, we identified proteins that may interact with GPR158, and the relevant enrichment pathways were consistent with the immunofluorescence findings. RNA-seq analysis of the cerebral cortex of the GPR158-/- mice showed that GPR158 and its putative interacting proteins are involved in the chloride channel complex and synaptic vesicle membrane composition. Using these GPR158Tag mice, we were able to accurately label GPR158 and uncover its fundamental function in synaptic vesicle function and memory. Thus, this model will be a useful tool for subsequent biological, pharmacological, and electrophysiological studies related to GPR158.
