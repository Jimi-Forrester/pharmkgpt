METHODS: The primary components of AJ were determined using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). The blood stasis model was used to investigate the anti-blood-stasis effect of AJ extract. The underlying mechanisms of AJ against blood stasis were investigated via network pharmacology, molecular docking, and plasma non-targeted metabolomics. RESULTS: In total, 94 compounds were identified from an aqueous extract of AJ, including terpenoids, phenylpropanoids, alkaloids, and fatty acyl compounds. In rats with blood stasis, AJ reduced the area of stasis, decreased the inflammatory reaction in the liver and lungs of rats, lowered the plasma viscosity, increased the index of erythrocyte deformability, and decreased the index of erythrocyte aggregation, suggesting that AJ has an anti-blood-stasis effect. Different metabolites were identified via plasma untargeted metabolomics, and it was found that AJ exerts its anti-blood-stasis effect by reducing inflammatory responses through the cysteine and methionine metabolism, linolenic acid metabolism, and sphingolipid metabolism. For the effect of AJ on blood stasis syndrome, the main active ingredients predicted via network pharmacology include sinensetin, galanin, isorhamnetin, kaempferol, wogonin, quercetin, and bergenin, and their targets were TP53, HSP90AA1, VEGFA, AKT1, EGFR, and PIK3CA that were mainly enriched in the PI3K/AKT and MAPK signaling pathways, which modulate the inflammatory response. Molecular docking was also performed, and the binding energies of these seven compounds to six proteins were less than -5, indicating that the chemical components bind to the target proteins. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests AJ effectively prevents blood stasis by reducing inflammation.
