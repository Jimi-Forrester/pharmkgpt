38755113|a|BACKGROUND: Drug-induced delirium is known risk factors associated with increased morbidity and mortality in older patients. The objective was to evaluate the risk of drug-related delirium in older patients based on the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Delirium reports in older patients (age >=65) extracted from the FAERS database using Open Vigil 2.1. The reported odds ratio and the proportional reported ratio were calculated to detect the adverse reaction signal of delirium. Combined with published evidence, suspected drugs were categorized as known, possible, or new potential delirium-risk-increasing drugs. RESULTS: Of the 130,885 reports (including 28,850 delirium events and 1,857 drugs) analyzed for this study, 314 positive signal drugs were detected. Positive signal drugs are mainly concentrated on the drug of nervous system, cardiovascular system , alimentary tract and metabolism and anti-infectives for systemic use. Of the positive signal drugs, 26.11% (82/314) were known delirium-risk increasing drugs, 44.90% (141/314) were possible and 28.98% (91/314) were new potential. CONCLUSION: Drug-induced delirium risk is prevalent in older patients, according to the FAERS. The risk level of drug-induced delirium should be taken into account to optimize drug therapy in clinical practice.
