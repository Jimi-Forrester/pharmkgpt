36241971|a|BACKGROUND: Hoarding symptoms are associated with functional impairment, though investigation of disability among individuals with hoarding disorder has largely focused on clutter-related impairment to home management activities and difficulties using space because of clutter. This analysis assesses disability among individuals with hoarding symptoms in multiple domains of everyday functioning, including cognition, mobility, self-care, interpersonal and community-level interactions, and home management. The magnitude of the association between hoarding and disability was compared to that of medical and psychiatric disorders with documented high disability burden, including major depressive disorder (MDD), diabetes, and chronic pain. METHODS: Data were cross-sectionally collected from 16,312 adult participants enrolled in an internet-based research registry, the Brain Health Registry. Pearson's chi-square tests and multivariable logistic regression models were used to quantify the relationship between hoarding and functional ability relative to MDD, diabetes, and chronic pain. RESULTS: More than one in ten participants endorsed clinical (5.7%) or subclinical (5.7%) hoarding symptoms (CHS and SCHS, respectively). After adjusting for participant demographic characteristics and psychiatric and medical comorbidity, CHS and SCHS were associated with increased odds of impairment in all domains of functioning. Moderate to extreme impairment was endorsed more frequently by those with CHS or SCHS compared to those with self-reported MDD, diabetes, and/or chronic pain in nearly all domains (e.g., difficulty with day-to-day work or school: CHS: 18.7% vs. MDD: 11.8%, p < 0.0001) except mobility and self-care. While those with current depressive symptoms endorsed higher rates of impairment than those with hoarding symptoms, disability was most prevalent among those endorsing both hoarding and comorbid depressive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Hoarding symptoms are associated with profound disability in all domains of functioning. The burden of hoarding is comparable to that of other medical and psychiatric illnesses with known high rates of functional impairment. Future studies should examine the directionality and underlying causality of the observed associations, and possibly identify target interventions to minimize impairment associated with hoarding symptomatology.
