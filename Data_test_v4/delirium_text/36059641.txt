36059641|a|Backgroud: Skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) is an extremely metastatic form of skin cancer. However, there are few valuable molecular biomarkers, and accurate diagnosis is still a challenge. Hypercoagulable state encourages the infiltration and development of tumor cells and is significantly associated with poor prognosis in cancer patients. However, the use of a coagulation-related gene (CRG) signature for prognosis in SKCM, on the other hand, has yet to be determined. Method: We used data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Genotype Tissue Expression (GTEx) databases to identify differentially expressed CRGs, then designed a prognostic model by using the LASSO algorithm, univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis, and constructed a nomogram which was evaluated by calibration curves. Moreover, the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), GSE54467 was used as an independent validation. The correlation between risk score and clinicopathological characteristics, tumor microenvironment (TME), and immunotherapy was further analyzed. Results: To develop a prognostic model, seven CRGs in SKCM patients related to overall survival (OS) were selected: ANG, C1QA, CFB, DUSP6, KLKB1, MMP7, and RABIF. According to the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, an increased OS was observed in the low-risk group than in the high-risk group (P<0.05). Immunotherapy was much more beneficial in the low-risk group, as per immune infiltration, functional enrichment, and immunotherapy analysis. Conclusions: The prognosis of SKCM patients may now be predicted with the use of a CRG prognostic model, thus guiding the development of treatment plans for SKCM patients and promoting OS rates.
