35145189|t|Mortality and readmission rates among hospitalized COVID-19 patients with varying stages of chronic kidney disease: a multicenter retrospective cohort.
35145189|a|Chronic kidney disease (CKD) has been recognized as a highly prevalent risk factor for both the severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and COVID-19 associated adverse outcomes. In this multicenter observational cohort study, we aim to determine mortality and readmission rates of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 across varying CKD stages. We performed a multicenter cohort study among COVID-19 patients included in the Dutch COVIDPredict cohort. The cohort consists of hospitalized patients from March 2020 until July 2021 with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection or a highly suspected CT scan-based infection with a CORADS score >= 4. A total of 4151 hospitalized COVID-19 patients were included of who 389 had a history of CKD before admission. After adjusting for all confounding covariables, in patients with CKD stage 3a, stage 3b, stage 4 and patients with KTX (kidney transplantation), odds ratios of death and readmission compared to patients without CKD ranged from 1.96 to 8.94. We demonstrate an evident increased 12-week mortality and readmission rate in patients with chronic kidney disease. Besides justified concerns for kidney transplant patients, clinicians should also be aware of more severe COVID-19 outcomes and increased vulnerability in CKD patients.
