33918426|a|In the recent pandemic disease, called COVID-19, the role of neurologists and neurobiologists represents a chance to study key features of brain infection and deepen neurological manifestations of COVID-19 and other coronavirus infections. In fact, many studies suggest brain damage during infection and persistent neurological symptoms after COVID-19 infection. Reverse transcription PCR test, antibody tests, Computed Tomography (CT) of the lung, and Magnetic Resonance (MR) of the brain of the patient were periodically performed during this case report for eight months after infection. The aim of this article is to describe the prolonged neurological clinical consequences related to COVID-19. We believe it is clinically clear that we can define a post-acute COVID-19 neurological syndrome. Therefore, in patients after a severe clinical condition of COVID-19, a deepening of persistent neurological signs is necessary.
