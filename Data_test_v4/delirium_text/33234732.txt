33234732|a|Perivascular spaces in the brain have been known to communicate with cerebrospinal fluid and contribute to waste clearance in animal models. In this study, we sought to determine the association between MRI-visible enlarged perivascular spaces (EPVS) and disease markers in Parkinson's disease (PD). We obtained longitudinal data from 245 patients with PD and 98 healthy controls from the Parkinson's Progression Marker Initiative. Two trained neurologists performed visual ratings on T2-weighted images to characterize EPVS in the centrum semiovale (CSO), the basal ganglia (BG) and the midbrain. We found that a greater proportion of patients with PD had low grade BG-EPVS relative to healthy controls. In patients with PD, lower grade of BG-EPVS and CSO-EPVS predicted lower CSF alpha-synuclein and t-tau. Lower grade of BG-EPVS were also associated with accelerated Hoehn &Yahr stage progression in patients with baseline stage 1. BG-EPVS might be a valuable predictor of disease progression.
