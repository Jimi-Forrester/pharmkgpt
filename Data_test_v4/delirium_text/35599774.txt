35599774|a|There is evidence that chronic fatigue spectrum disorders (CFAS-Ds), including myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME), chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), and chronic fatigue with physiosomatic symptoms including when due to comorbid medical disease, are characterized by neuroimmune and neuro-oxidative biomarkers. This study was performed to delineate the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of CFAS-D and to discover the pathways, molecular patterns, and domains enriched in their PPI network. We performed network, enrichment, and annotation analyses using differentially expressed proteins and metabolics, which were established in patients with CFAS-D. The PPI network analysis revealed that the backbone of the highly connective CFAS-D network comprises NFKB1, CTNNB1, ALB, peroxides, NOS2, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) and that the network comprises interconnected immune-oxidative-nitrosative and Wnt/beta-catenin subnetworks. Multiomics enrichment analysis shows that the CFAS-D network is highly significantly associated with cellular (antioxidant) detoxification, hydrogen peroxide metabolic process, peroxidase and oxidoreductase activity, interleukin-10 (IL-10) anti-inflammatory signaling and neurodegenerative canonical Wnt, the beta-catenin complex, cadherin domains, cell-cell junctions and TLR2/4 pathways, and the transcription factors nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) and RELA. The top 10 DOID annotations of the CFAS-D network include four intestinal, three immune system disorders, cancer, and infectious disease. The custom Gene Ontology (GO) term annotation analysis revealed that the CFAS-D network is associated with a response to a toxic substance, lipopolysaccharides, bacterium, or virus. In conclusion, CFAS-D may be triggered by a variety of stimuli and their effects are mediated by aberrations in the cross-talks between redox, NF-kappaB, and Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathways leading to dysfunctions in multicellular organismal homeostatic processes.
