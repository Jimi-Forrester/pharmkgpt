15170326|a|To structurally characterize the nonaggregated state of the amyloid beta peptide, which assembles into the hallmark fibrils of Alzheimer disease, we investigated the conformation of the N-terminal extracellular peptide fragment Abeta(1-28) in D(2)O at acidic pD by utilizing combined FTIR and isotropic and anisotropic Raman spectra measured between 1550 and 1750 cm(-1). Peptide aggregation is avoided under the conditions chosen. The amide I' band was found to exhibit a significant noncoincidence effect in that the first moment of the anisotropic Raman and of the IR band profile appears red-shifted from that of the isotropic Raman scattering. A simulation based on a coupled oscillator model involving all 27 amide I' modes of the peptide reveals that the peptide adopts a predominantly polyproline II conformation. Our results are inconsistent with the notion that the monomeric form of Abeta(1-28) is a totally disordered, random-coil structure. Generally, they underscore the notion that polyproline II is a characteristic motif of the unfolded state of proteins and peptides.
