2510921|t|Organic mania induced by phenytoin: a case report.
2510921|a|Organic Mood Disorder of the manic type is a syndrome which resembles a manic episode but is due to a specific organic factor. Organic mania may be associated with a variety of physical illnesses such as temporal lobe epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, neoplasms and hyperthyroidism. In addition, organic mania can be associated with drugs including L-dopa, decongestants, sympathomimetics, steroids, baclofen withdrawal, cimetidine, and possibly captopril. This report describes a case of a 74 year old female who presented with a full syndrome of mania soon after being started on phenytoin. Neither the clinical picture, Mini-mental state score, nor EEG findings were suggestive of delirium. The syndrome resolved soon after the phenytoin was discontinued. This case suggests that phenytoin should be added to the list of medications capable of producing Organic Mood Syndrome, manic type.
