38328026|a|This study assessed whether the effect of vascular risk on cerebral blood flow (CBF) varies by gene dose of apolipoprotein (APOE) epsilon4 alleles. 144 older adults without dementia from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative underwent arterial spin labeling and T1-weighted MRI, APOE genotyping, fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), lumbar puncture, and blood pressure (BP) assessment. Vascular risk was assessed using pulse pressure (systolic BP - diastolic BP). CBF was examined in six AD-vulnerable regions: entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, inferior temporal cortex, inferior parietal cortex, rostral middle frontal gyrus, and medial orbitofrontal cortex. Linear regressions tested the interaction between APOE epsilon4 dose and pulse pressure on CBF in each region, adjusting for age, sex, cognitive classification, antihypertensive medication use, FDG-PET, reference CBF region, and AD biomarker positivity. There was a significant interaction between pulse pressure and APOE e4 dose on CBF in the entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, and inferior parietal cortex, such that higher pulse pressure was associated with lower CBF only among epsilon4 homozygous participants. These findings demonstrate that the association between pulse pressure and regional CBF differs by APOE epsilon4 dose, suggesting that targeting modifiable vascular risk factors may be particularly important for those genetically at risk for AD.
