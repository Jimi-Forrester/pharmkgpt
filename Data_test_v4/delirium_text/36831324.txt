36831324|t|Mechanisms of Blood-Brain Barrier Protection by Microbiota-Derived Short-Chain Fatty Acids.
36831324|a|Impairment of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity is implicated in the numerous neurological disorders associated with neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration and aging. It is now evident that short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), mainly acetate, butyrate and propionate, produced by anaerobic bacterial fermentation of the dietary fiber in the intestine, have a key role in the communication between the gastrointestinal tract and nervous system and are critically important for the preservation of the BBB integrity under different pathological conditions. The effect of SCFAs on the improvement of the compromised BBB is mainly based on the decrease in paracellular permeability via restoration of junctional complex proteins affecting their transcription, intercellular localization or proteolytic degradation. This review is focused on the revealed and putative underlying mechanisms of the direct and indirect effects of SCFAs on the improvement of the barrier function of brain endothelial cells. We consider G-protein-coupled receptor-mediated effects of SCFAs, SCFAs-stimulated acetylation of histone and non-histone proteins via inhibition of histone deacetylases, and crosstalk of these signaling pathways with transcriptional factors NF-kappaB and Nrf2 as mainstream mechanisms of SCFA's effect on the preservation of the BBB integrity.
