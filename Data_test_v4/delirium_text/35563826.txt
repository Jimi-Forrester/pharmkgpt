35563826|t|RhoA Signaling in Neurodegenerative Diseases.
35563826|a|Ras homolog gene family member A (RhoA) is a small GTPase of the Rho family involved in regulating multiple signal transduction pathways that influence a diverse range of cellular functions. RhoA and many of its downstream effector proteins are highly expressed in the nervous system, implying an important role for RhoA signaling in neurons and glial cells. Indeed, emerging evidence points toward a role of aberrant RhoA signaling in neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge of RhoA regulation and downstream cellular functions with an emphasis on the role of RhoA signaling in neurodegenerative diseases and the therapeutic potential of RhoA inhibition in neurodegeneration.
