29997675|a|Adipose tissue growth is angiogenesis-dependent, and angiogenesis inhibitors can regulate adipose tissue mass by cutting off the blood supply. We examined whether antiangiogenic herbal composition Ob-X can reduce fast-growing abdominal fat, especially visceral fat in humans by inhibiting angiogenesis. Eighty abdominally obese subjects (body mass index: 25-29.9 kg/m2, waist circumference: exceeding 90 cm for males and 85 cm for females) participated in a 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled human study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Ob-X. 690 mg of Ob-X was administered orally twice a day. The Ob-X group showed a noticeable reduction in visceral fat of 20.5% after the 12-week treatment as compared to baseline measured by computed tomography. The change in visceral fat in the Ob-X group was statistically significant as compared to the placebo group (p = 0.0495) and 1.9 times higher than in the placebo group. Therefore, angiogenesis inhibitor Ob-X has the potential to improve obesity-related metabolic syndrome by reducing dangerous visceral fat.
