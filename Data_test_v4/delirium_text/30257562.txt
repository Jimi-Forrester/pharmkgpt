30257562|a|This study focuses on the interaction of human amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) with a lipid-raft model membrane under macromolecular crowding conditions that mimic the intracellular environment. Abeta is central to the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and has been studied extensively to determine the molecular mechanisms of Abeta-induced cellular dysfunctions underlying the pathogenesis of AD. According to evidence from spectroscopic studies, ganglioside clusters are key to the fibrillization process of Abeta. Gangliosides are a major component of glycosphingolipids and are acidic lipids of the central nervous system known to form so-called lipid rafts. In this study, the small unilamellar vesicle (SUV) membrane, composed of monosialogangliosides, cholesterol, and 1,2-dipalmitoyl- sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, did not show any structural changes after the addition of Abeta under noncrowding conditions. However, the addition of Abeta under crowding conditions induced shape deformation and aggregation to SUV resulting in multilamellar stacking. The time evolution of the lamellar peak suggested the preferential cohesion or intercalation of the Abeta peptide into the interbilayer region. This phenomenon was only observed at the gel (Lbeta) phase. These results suggest that an intracellular crowding environment promotes Abeta-membrane interaction and a selective accumulation of Abeta peptides into the interbilayer regions.
