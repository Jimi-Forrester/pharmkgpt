23416320|a|The association between insulin degrading enzyme (IDE) gene polymorphisms and Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk has been widely reported, but results were somewhat controversial. To assess the association between IDE polymorphisms and AD risk, a meta-analysis was performed. We systematically reviewed relevant studies retrieved by PubMed, Embase, AlzGene, CNKI and Web of Science. Finally, 8 articles were identified for rs3758505 polymorphism and 5 for rs1832196 polymorphism. The pooled ORs were performed for all the four genetic models. Subgroup analysis was also performed by ethnicity. Results suggested that rs3758505 polymorphism was unlikely to be associated with genetic susceptibility of AD based on the current published studies. However, for the rs1832196 polymorphism, significant association with AD was found by the dominant model in overall and subgroup analysis. However, larger scale association studies are necessary to further validate the association of IDE polymorphisms with sporadic AD risk and to define potential gene-gene interactions.
