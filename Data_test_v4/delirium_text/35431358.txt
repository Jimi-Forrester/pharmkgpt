35431358|a|Background: hip fracture is the major cause of morbidity and mortality. Geriatric fracture programs promise to improve the quality of care, health outcomes and reduce costs. Objective: To describe the results related to the Geriatric fracture programs implementation in two Colombian institutions to assess reproducibility. Methods: We performed A retrospective descriptive study of the patients treated under the Geriatric fracture programs in two institutions in Colombia. The information was collected from the initial year of implementation until 2018. Demographic characteristics, length of stay, hospitalization complications, readmissions and mortality were described. Consumption of healthcare resources was defined using base cases determined with local experts and costs were estimated using standard methods. Results: 475 patients were included in the Geriatric fracture programs. We observed an increase in the number of patients. The length of stay decreased between 8.5% and 26.1% as did the proportion of total complications, with delirium having the greatest reduction. A similar situation was seen for first year mortality (from 10.9% to 4.7%), in-hospital deaths and readmissions. Estimates of costs of stay and complications showed reductions in all scenarios, varying between 22% and 68.3%. Conclusions: The present study presents the experience of two institutions that implemented the Geriatric fracture programs with increase in the number of patients treated and reductions in the time of hospital stay, the proportion of complications, readmissions, mortality and estimated costs. These are similar between both institutions and with other published implementations. This could hint that geriatric fracture program may be implemented with reproducible results.
