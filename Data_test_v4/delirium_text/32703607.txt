32703607|a|Since December 2019, COVID-19, the clinical syndrome associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, has infected more than 6.2 million people and brought the function of the global community to a halt. As the number of patients recovered from COVID-19 rises and the world transitions toward reopening, the question of acquired immunity versus the possibility of reinfection are critical to anticipating future viral spread. Here, we present a case of a patient previously recovered from COVID-19 who re-presents with new respiratory, radiographical, laboratory, and real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) findings concerning for possible re-infection. We review this case in the context of the evolving discussion and theories surrounding dynamic RT-PCR results, prolonged viral shedding, and the possibility of developed immunity. Understanding how to interpret dynamic and late-positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR results after primary infection will be critical for understanding disease prevalence and spread among communities worldwide.
