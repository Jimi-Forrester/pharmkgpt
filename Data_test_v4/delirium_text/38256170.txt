38256170|t|Glutathione Reductase Expression and Its Prognostic Significance in Colon Cancer.
38256170|a|Maintaining a balanced redox state within cells is crucial for the sustenance of life. The process involves continuous cytosolic disulfide reduction reactions to restore oxidized proteins to their reduced thiol forms. There are two main cellular antioxidant pathways-the thioredoxin (Trx) and glutathione (GSH)/glutaredoxin (Grx) systems. In the GSH/Grx system, glutathione reductase (GR; GSR) catalyses the reduction of GSH disulfide (GSSG) to its sulfhydryl form (GSH), which can then further reduce oxidized Grxs. GR is an essential enzyme that helps in maintaining the supply of reduced glutathione-GSH, which is a significant reducing thiol found in most cells and known for its antioxidant properties. Therefore, it can have a significant impact on cancer development. To investigate this further, we performed an immunohistochemical analysis of GR protein expression in colon adenocarcinoma samples collected from patients with primary colon adenocarcinoma (stage I and II) and patients with metastasis to regional lymph nodes (stage III). The results of our study revealed a significant relationship between the immunohistochemical expression of GR and tumour histological grade, depth of invasion, regional lymph node involvement, staging, and PCNA immunohistochemical expression. It was found that 95% of patients with stage I had low levels of GR expression, whereas 89% of patients with stage III had high levels of immunohistochemical expression. A high level of expression was also detected in the patients with stage II of the disease, where almost 63% were characterized by a high expression of GR. The Western blot method revealed that the highest level of expression was found in the LS 174T cell line, which corresponds to stage II. The results of our study indicate that the immunohistochemical expression of GR may act as an independent prognostic factor associated with colon adenocarcinoma patients' prognosis.
