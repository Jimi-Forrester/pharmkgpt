35011701|t|Insights into Modern Therapeutic Approaches in Pediatric Acute Leukemias.
35011701|a|Pediatric cancers predominantly constitute lymphomas and leukemias. Recently, our knowledge and awareness about genetic diversities, and their consequences in these diseases, have greatly expanded. Modern solutions are focused on mobilizing and impacting a patient's immune system. Strategies to stimulate the immune system, to prime an antitumor response, are of intense interest. Amid those types of therapies are chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cells, bispecific antibodies, and antibody-drug conjugates (ADC), which have already been approved in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)/acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In addition, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), the pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), i.e., NOD-like receptors (NLRs), Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and several kinds of therapy antibodies are well on their way to showing significant benefits for patients with these diseases. This review summarizes the current knowledge of modern methods used in selected pediatric malignancies and presents therapies that may hold promise for the future.
