20105122|t|Lycorine and its derivatives for anticancer drug design.
20105122|a|Amaryllidaceae alkaloids are extensively studied for their biological activities in several pharmaceutical areas, including, for example, Alzheimer's disease for which galanthamine has already reached the market. Among this chemical family, lycorine displays very promising anti-tumor properties. This review first focuses on the chemical diversity of natural and synthetic analogues of lycorine and their metabolites, and then on mechanisms of action and biological targets through which lycorine and its derivatives display their anti-tumor activity. Our analysis of the structure-activity relationships of this family of compounds highlights the existence of various potential leads for the development of novel anticancer agents.
