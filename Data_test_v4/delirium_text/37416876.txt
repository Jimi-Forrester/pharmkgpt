37416876|a|Cyclic anthraquinone derivatives (cAQs), which link two side chains of 1,5-disubstituted anthraquinone as a threading DNA intercalator, have been developed as G-quartet (G4) DNA-specific ligands. Among the cAQs, cAQ-mBen linked through the 1,3-position of benzene had the strongest affinity for G4 recognition and stabilization in vitro and was confirmed to bind to the G4 structure in vivo, selectively inhibiting cancer cell proliferation in correlation with telomerase expression levels and triggering cell apoptosis. RNA-sequencing analysis further indicated that differentially expressed genes regulated by cAQ-mBen were profiled with more potential quadruplex-forming sequences. In the treatment of the tumor-bearing mouse model, cAQ-mBen could effectively reduce tumor tissue and had less adverse effects on healthy tissue. These results suggest that cAQ-mBen can be a potential cancer therapeutic agent as a G4 binder.
