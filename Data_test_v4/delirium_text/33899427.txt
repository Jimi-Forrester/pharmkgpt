It is difficult to determine the atrophy areas, especially for patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) at different stages of AD, which results in a low diagnostic rate. Therefore, an early diagnosis model of AD based on 3-dimensional convolutional neural network (3DCNN) and genetic algorithm (GA) was proposed. Firstly, the 3DCNN was used to train a base classifier for each region of interest (ROI). And then, the optimal combination of the base classifiers was determined with the GA. Finally, the ensemble consisting of the chosen base classifiers was employed to make a diagnosis for a patient and the brain regions with significant classification capability were decided. The experimental results showed that the classification accuracy was 88.6% for AD vs. normal control (NC), 88.1% for MCI patients who will convert to AD (MCIc) vs. NC, and 71.3% for MCI patients who will not convert to AD (MCInc) vs. MCIc. In addition, with the statistical analysis of the behavioral domains corresponding to ROIs (i.e. brain regions), besides left hippocampus, medial and lateral amygdala, and left para-hippocampal gyrus, anterior superior temporal sulcus of middle temporal gyrus and dorsal area 23 of cingulate gyrus were also found with GA. It is concluded that the functions of the selected brain regions mainly are relevant to emotions, memory, cognition and the like, which is basically consistent with the symptoms of indifference, memory losses, mobility decreases and cognitive declines in AD patients. All of these show that the proposed method is effective.
