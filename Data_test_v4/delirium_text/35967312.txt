35967312|t|Multidimensional overview of neurofilament light chain contribution to comprehensively understanding multiple sclerosis.
35967312|a|Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory neurodegenerative disease characterized by demyelination, progressive axonal loss, and varying clinical presentations. Axonal damage associated with the inflammatory process causes neurofilaments, the major neuron structural proteins, to be released into the extracellular space, reaching the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and the peripheral blood. Methodological advances in neurofilaments' serological detection and imaging technology, along with many clinical and therapeutic studies in the last years, have deepened our understanding of MS immunopathogenesis. This review examines the use of light chain neurofilaments (NFLs) as peripheral MS biomarkers in light of the current clinical and therapeutic evidence, MS immunopathology, and technological advances in diagnostic tools. It aims to highlight NFL multidimensional value as a reliable MS biomarker with a diagnostic-prognostic profile while improving our comprehension of inflammatory neurodegenerative processes, mainly RRMS, the most frequent clinical presentation of MS.
