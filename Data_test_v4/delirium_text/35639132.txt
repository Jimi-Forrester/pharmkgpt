35639132|a|PURPOSE: To investigate the association between acute kidney injury (AKI) and use of second-generation antipsychotics (SGA) in older adults. METHODS: In a population-based cohort study using Danish national registries, new users of SGAs (aged >= 65) were identified during 2005-2015. Each SGA user was matched to 10 population controls on age, sex, and the SGA initiation date. The outcome was incident AKI within 90 days after the index date. Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), adjusting for potential confounders. RESULTS: In the study, 36,581 new SGA users and 365,810 controls were included. The 90-day incidence rate of AKI was 4.38 and 1.70 per 1000 person-years among SGA users and controls, respectively, corresponding to a crude HR of 2.57 (1.79-3.68). The fully adjusted HR (aHR) was 1.43 (0.89-2.27) for all SGAs. The risk differed among individual drugs with aHRs for olanzapine 3.50 (1.20-10.23), quetiapine 1.62 (0.81-3.26), and risperidone 0.68 (0.28-1.64). In sensitivity analyses, the aHR declined to 1.24 (0.95-1.61) at 1-year follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Olanzapine use was associated with a significantly increased 90-day AKI risk. For quetiapine, the risk was elevated but not significant, and risperidone had no association. CIs were wide and confounder adjustment largely impacted the estimates. Main limitations included residual confounding and incomplete recording of AKI diagnoses.
