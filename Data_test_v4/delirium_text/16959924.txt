16959924|a|The authors studied factors associated with referral of delirium patients to psychiatry consultation and its outcome implications. Characteristics and treatment outcomes of delirium patients referred to psychiatry were compared with those not referred. Referred patients were younger, had a more hyperactive subtype, greater substance abuse, less comorbid dementia, were more likely to be recognized as having delirium, and be prescribed medications. Improvement in referred patients was indicated by lower readmission rate postdischarge. No differences were noted in length of stay, discharge status, or mortality within 1 year of the index episode. Psychiatric interventions were moderately helpful. Patients' characteristics and delirium subtypes may influence referral and should inform future liaison efforts.
