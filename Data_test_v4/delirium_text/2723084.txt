2723084|t|Rey-Auditory Verbal Learning and Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Design performance in Alzheimer's disease and closed head injury.
2723084|a|Performance on the Rey-Auditory Verbal Learning (R-AVL) and Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Design (R-O CFD) tests was examined in patients (N = 94) with dementia of the Alzheimer's type (DAT) and closed head injury (CHI). On the R-AVL, DAT patients demonstrated considerably greater impairment than CHI patients, along with a flat learning/retention curve that showed negligible improvement with repeated trials, recency effects only, and an excessive number of word intrusions (confabulation) on the recognition trial. CHI patients demonstrated both a recency and primacy effect along with improvement over repeated trials (positive slope learning curve). Both groups demonstrated impairment R-O CFD recall; the DAT group again displayed substantially greater copying and recall deficits. Clinical guidelines are given for the use of the R-AVL and R-O CFD for these two patient populations.
