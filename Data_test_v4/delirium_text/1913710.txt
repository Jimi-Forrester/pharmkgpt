1913710|t|Nerve growth factor and Alzheimer's disease.
1913710|a|Clinical trials with cholinergic agents suggest that cholinergic hypertrophy may be beneficial in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent findings substantiate the view that nerve growth factor (NGF) selectively acts on cholinergic neurons. In adult rats and primates, intraventricular administration of nerve growth factor produces trophic actions on cholinergic neurons and prevents age related neuronal atrophy. These findings suggest the possibility of the eventual development of pharmacological applications of nerve growth factor for the treatment of AD.
