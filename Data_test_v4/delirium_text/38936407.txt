38936407|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Inhibitors of histone deacetylases (iHDACs) are promising drugs for neurodegenerative diseases. We have evaluated the therapeutic potential of the new iHDAC LASSBio-1911 in Abeta oligomer (AbetaO) toxicity models and astrocytes, key players in neuroinflammation and Alzheimer's disease (AD). EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Astrocyte phenotype and synapse density were evaluated by flow cytometry, Western blotting, immunofluorescence and qPCR, in vitro and in mice. Cognitive function was evaluated by behavioural assays using a mouse model of intracerebroventricular infusion of AbetaO. KEY RESULTS: LASSBio-1911 modulates reactivity and synaptogenic potential of cultured astrocytes and improves synaptic markers in cultured neurons and in mice. It prevents AbetaO-triggered astrocytic reactivity in mice and enhances the neuroprotective potential of astrocytes. LASSBio-1911 improves behavioural performance and rescues synaptic and memory function in AbetaO-infused mice. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: These results contribute to unveiling the mechanisms underlying astrocyte role in AD and provide the rationale for using astrocytes as targets to new drugs for AD.
