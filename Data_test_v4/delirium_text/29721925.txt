29721925|t|MicroRNA as Therapeutics for Age-Related Macular Degeneration.
29721925|a|MicroRNA (miRNA) are a class of endogenously expressed small non-coding RNA molecules that function by repressing or silencing post-transcriptional gene expression. While miRNAs were only identified in humans as recently as the turn of this century, some miRNA-based agents are already in Phase 2 clinical trials (Christopher et al. 2016). This rapid progress from initial discovery to drug development reflects the effectiveness of miRNAs as therapeutic targets. Further, their use as therapeutic agents in the treatment of diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (Wang et al. 2014) supports their use in other neurodegenerative diseases, such as Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD). However, despite ~300 miRNAs reportedly expressed in the human retina (Xu 2009), relatively little research has been conducted into the therapeutic potential of miRNAs for the treatment of AMD. This review will investigate the use of miRNAs as therapeutic and diagnostic molecules for AMD.
