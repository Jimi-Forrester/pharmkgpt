33172388|a|BACKGROUND: Cognitive decline is common in older adults. Similarly, the prevalence of renal dysfunction is also increased in the elderly population. We conducted this study to clarify the relationship between renal dysfunction and decline of cognitive function in community-dwelling elderly population. METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis was performed using data from the Korean Frailty and Aging Cohort Study, a nationwide cohort study. Total 2847 (1333 men, 1514 women) eligible participants were enrolled for this study. The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR, mL/min/1.73m2) was calculated using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation. Global cognitive function was assessed with the Mini-mental State Examination-Korean version. Other domains of cognitive function were tested with the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's disease and the Frontal Assessment Battery. RESULTS: The mean age of all participants was 76.0 +- 3.9 years and eGFR (all in mL/min/1.73 m2) was 77.5 +- 14.3. And the mean eGFR was 91.7 +- 3.2 in quartile 1, 84.9 +- 1.8 in quartile 2, 76.1 +- 3.7 in quartile 3, and 57.2 +- 10.8 in quartile 4. In baseline characteristics, participants with lower eGFR tend to have lower cognitive function scores than participant with higher eGFR. In linear regression analysis, eGFR was correlated with the word list memory (beta = 0.53, P = 0.005), word list recall (beta = 0.86, P < 0.001), and word list recognition (beta = 0.43, P = 0.030) after adjustment of confounding variables. Moreover, after multivariate adjustment the association with cognitive impairment in quartile 2 was stronger (adjusted OR: 1.535, 95% CI: 1.111-2.120, P = 0.009), and the ORs of cognitive impairment were 1.501 (95% CI: 1.084-2.079, P = 0.014) in quartile 3 and 1.423 (95% CI: 1.022-1.983, P = 0.037) in quartile 4. CONCLUSION: In older adults, the immediate, recent memory, and recognition domains were significantly related to renal function. Also, the mild renal dysfunction was independently associated with impairment of global cognitive function. These results suggest that the early stages of renal dysfunction could be an effective target to prevent worsening of cognitive impairment. Therefore, regular monitoring and early detection of mild renal dysfunction in elderly population might be needed.
