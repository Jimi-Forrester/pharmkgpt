16869261|a|Of all steroidal hormones, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and its sulphate form, DHEAS, are synthesized by the adrenal glands in the biggest quantities. In this review the authors consider the ways of the synthesis of the neurosteroids, possible mechanisms of the regulation of these processes, and their dynamics under stressful conditions. The paper presents analysis of experimental and clinical data on the role of DHEAS in the manifestation of different cerebral functions. The authors pay special attention to the results of substitutive therapy with DHEA(S) in patients with such CNS functional disorders, as Alzheimer's disease, depression, age-relative memory and sleep disturbances, etc.
