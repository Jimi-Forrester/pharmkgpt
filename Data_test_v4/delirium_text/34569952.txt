34569952|t|A Review of APOE Genotype-Dependent Autophagic Flux Regulation in Alzheimer's Disease.
34569952|a|Autophagy is a basic physiological process maintaining cell renewal, the degradation of dysfunctional organelles, and the clearance of abnormal proteins and has recently been identified as a main mechanism underlying the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The APOE e4 genotype is the strongest genetic determinant of AD pathogenesis and initiates autophagic flux at different times. This review synthesizes the current knowledge about the potential pathogenic effects of ApoE4 on autophagy and describes its associations with the biological hallmarks of autophagy and AD from a novel perspective. Via a remarkable variety of widely accepted signaling pathway markers, such as mTOR, TFEB, SIRT1, LC3, p62, LAMP1, LAMP2, CTSD, Rabs, and V-ATPase, ApoE isoforms differentially modulate autophagy initiation; membrane expansion, recruitment, and enclosure; autophagosome and lysosome fusion; and lysosomal degradation. Although the precise pathogenic mechanism varies for different genes and proteins, the dysregulation of autophagic flux is a key mechanism on which multiple pathogenic processes converge.
