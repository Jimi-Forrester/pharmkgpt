35836409|t|The Influence of Dementia Beliefs and Knowledge on Perceived Dementia Worry: An Empirical Study Among Adults in Rural China.
35836409|a|Alzheimer's disease and related dementias are more prevalent in rural areas than in urban areas in China. This study aims to examine the role of dementia beliefs and knowledge in influencing dementia worry among rural adults in China. Data were generated in a cross-sectional survey of 577 participants. Hierarchical regression analyses found that both the beliefs and knowledge of dementia contributed to higher levels of dementia worry. The propensity score matching method affirmed the robustness of regression results. In addition, those aged 45-64 reported higher worry about dementia than those aged 65 or older, while being married was related to lower dementia worry. As one of the first kind studies that examined dementia worry in rural Chinese population, our findings suggest that policy and practice efforts should address cultural beliefs of dementia as they contributed to higher worry about dementia in rural areas.
