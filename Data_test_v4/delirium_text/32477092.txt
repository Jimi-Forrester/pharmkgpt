32477092|t|Extracellular Sortilin Proteopathy Relative to beta-Amyloid and Tau in Aged and Alzheimer's Disease Human Brains.
32477092|a|Amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) are hallmark lesions of Alzheimer's disease (AD) related to beta-amyloid (Abeta) deposition and intraneuronal phosphorylated tau (pTau) accumulation. Sortilin C-terminal fragments (shortened as "sorfra") can deposit as senile plaque-like lesions within AD brains. The course and pattern of sorfra plaque formation relative to Abeta and pTau pathogenesis remain unknown. In the present study, cerebral and subcortical sections in postmortem human brains (n = 46) from aged and AD subjects were stained using multiple markers (6E10, beta-secretase 1, pTau, and sortilin antibodies, as well as Bielschowsky silver stain). The course and pattern of sorfra plaque formation relative to Thal Abeta and Braak NFT pathogenic stages were determined. Sorfra plaques occurred in the temporal, inferior frontal and occipital neocortices in cases with Thal 1 and Braak III stages. They were also found additionally in the hippocampal formation, amygdala, and associative neocortex in cases with Thal 2-4 and Braak IV-V. Lastly, they were also found in the primary motor, somatosensory, and visual cortices in cases with Thal 4-5 and Braak VI. Unlike Abeta and pTau pathologies, sorfra plaques did not occur in subcortical structures in cases with Abeta/pTau lesions in Thal 3-5/Braak IV-VI stages. We establish here that sorfra plaques are essentially a cerebral proteopathy. We believe that the development of sorfra plaques in both cortical and hippocampal regions proceeds in a typical spatiotemporal pattern, and the stages of cerebral sorfra plaque formation partially overlap with that of Abeta and pTau pathologies.
