38585100|t|Small Molecule Optical Probes for Detection of H2S in Water Samples: A Review.
38585100|a|Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is closely linked to not only environmental hazards, but also it affects human health due to its toxic nature and the exposure risks associated with several occupational settings. Therefore, detection of this pollutant in water sources has garnered immense importance in the analytical research arena. Several research groups have devoted great efforts to explore the selective as well as sensitive methods to detect H2S concentrations in water. Recent studies describe different strategies for sensing this ubiquitous gas in real-life water samples. Though many of the designed and developed H2S detection approaches based on the use of organic small molecules facilitate qualitative/quantitative detection of the toxic contaminant in water, optical detection has been acknowledged as one of the best, attributed to the simple, highly sensitive, selective, and good repeatability features of the technique. Therefore, this review is an attempt to offer a general perspective of easy-to-use and fast response optical detection techniques for H2S, fluorimetry and colorimetry, over a wide variety of other instrumental platforms. The review affords a concise summary of the various design strategies adopted by various researchers in constructing small organic molecules as H2S sensors and offers insight into their mechanistic pathways. Moreover, it collates the salient aspects of optical detection techniques and highlights the future scope for prospective exploration in this field based on the limitations of the existing H2S probes.
