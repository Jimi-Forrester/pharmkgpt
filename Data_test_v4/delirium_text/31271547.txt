31271547|t|Cerebrospinal Fluid Markers of Synaptic Injury and Functional Connectivity in Alzheimer Disease: Protocol for a Cross-Sectional Study.
31271547|a|BACKGROUND: Synaptic loss is the best surrogate for cognitive decline in Alzheimer disease (AD) and is more closely associated with cognitive function than amyloid or tau pathologies. Neurogranin (Ng) and synaptosome-associated protein-25 (SNAP-25) have demonstrated utility as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers of synaptic injury in presymptomatic and symptomatic AD. While these synaptic markers have been shown to correlate with cognitive impairment and whole brain or regional atrophy in previous studies of AD, to our knowledge, the relationship between fluid markers of synaptic injury and functional brain imaging has not been previously investigated. OBJECTIVE: The main objective of this study is to examine the relationship between CSF markers of synaptic injury (Ng and SNAP-25) and functional connectivity (FC) in the default mode and semantic memory networks in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and mild dementia due to AD (Clinical Dementia Rating [CDR] 0.5-1) and cognitively normal controls (CDR 0), adjusting for age, gender, and the apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) genotype. Secondary objectives include investigating the associations between CSF markers of amyloid and tau pathology (CSF tau, p-tau181, and Abeta42) and FC in the default mode and semantic memory networks in AD (CDR 0.5-1) and controls (CDR 0), adjusting for age, gender, and the APOE4 genotype. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study of individuals with MCI or mild dementia due to AD (CDR 0.5-1; n=20), and cognitively normal controls (CDR 0; n=20). Participants will undergo detailed clinical and neuropsychological assessments, CSF biomarker assessments (CSF Ng, SNAP-25, tau, p-tau181, and Abeta42 levels) and functional magnetic resonance imaging assessments, using a Siemens 3.0 Tesla Prisma scanner, during resting state and during the performance of a semantic memory task. All study procedures will be completed within 4 months of enrollment. Partial correlation analyses will examine associations of CSF biomarker measures with FC in the default mode and semantic memory networks in AD and controls. RESULTS: This study was funded by the Chronic Brain Injury Discovery Themes of the Ohio State University College of Medicine. Study enrollment began in April 2018. Study procedures and data analysis are currently underway. Results are expected by December 2019. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this study will further support the utility of CSF Ng and SNAP-25 as markers of synaptic injury by examining their associations with functional alterations in cortical networks affected by early AD pathology.
