38058485|t|Palliative Care in Drug Resistance Tuberculosis: An Overlooked Component in Management.
38058485|a|Palliative care should be an important component in the management of drug resistant tuberculosis (DRTB); however, it is not given much importance. Even in the current scenario, many patients and their caregivers consider multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) as a terminal illness and considering it almost as a death sentence, this group of patients also require palliative care. There is a misconception about considering palliative care as a treatment component in the terminal stage of an illness where curative treatment has no role in improving the survival of the patient. However, the real meaning of palliative care is to relieve suffering in all stages of the disease and is not limited to end-of-life care only. Palliative care in DRTB aims to improve the quality of life, intractable symptoms and physical, psychosocial and spiritual suffering of patients as well as their caregivers. There is an imminent need to train all TB healthcare workers regarding basic palliative care and integrate palliative care into the TB healthcare system.
