35031005|a|OBJECTIVE: We aimed to compare the effect of dexmedetomidine with remifentanil on hemodynamic stability, surgical field quality, and surgeon satisfaction during rhinoplasty. METHODS AND MATERIALS: In this double-blind randomized controlled-trial, 60 participants scheduled for rhinoplasty at the Mother and Child Hospital, Shiraz, Iran, was randomely divided into the dexmedetomidine group (IV infusion of 1 mug/kg dexmedetomidine over 20 min before induction of anesthesia then 0.6 mug/kg/hr. dexmedetomidine from the time of induction until the end of the operation) or in the the remifentanil group (an infusion rate of 0.25 mug/kg/min from the time of anesthesia induction until the end of the operation). Bleeding volume, surgeon satisfaction, postoperative pain (visual analog scale (VAS)), Level of sedation (Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS)), Patient satisfaction, Vital signs & recovery, and the Aldrete Score (used to discharge the patients from recovery) were measured for all participants. RESULTS: The patients in the dexmedetomidine group had less bleeding (p = 0.047) and shorter time to return of respiration, extubation, and the postoperative recovery time (p < 0.001). The surgeon satisfaction was higher in the dexmedetomidine group (p < 0.001). Patient satisfaction was significantly different between the two groups (p < 0.001). VAS scores, intaking paracetamol, and RASS score were significantly lower in the remifentanil group (p < 0.001). SBP, DBP, MAP, and heart rate were lower in dexmedetomidine group. CONCLUSION: Dexmedetomidine was associated with relatively stable hemodynamics, leading to decreased intraoperative bleeding, recovery time, and greater surgeon satisfaction and the level of consciousness in the recovery ward. However, painlessness and patient satisfaction were greater with the use of remifentanil. TRIAL REGISTRATION: IRCT20141009019470N112 .
