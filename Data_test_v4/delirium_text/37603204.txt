37603204|t|Comparison of the Novel Digital Multi-dimension Botong Score with the Brief Pain Inventory for Evaluating Cancer-Related Pain: A Randomized Crossover Trial.
37603204|a|INTRODUCTION: Pain is a common symptom in patients with cancer, and comprehensive assessments of pain are crucial for decision-making of treatment regimens. This study aimed to compare the practicality of the novel digital multi-dimension Botong score (BTS) and the brief pain inventory (BPI) for evaluating cancer-related pain. METHODS: This randomized crossover trial enrolled patients with cancer-related pain at the Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Shandong First Medical University between July and December 2022. The participants were randomized 1:1 to BTS evaluation followed by BPI or vice versa. The consistency of BTS and BPI was analyzed, including pain score and the impact of pain on emotions and sleep. The convenience, patient preference, and the filling time of the two tools were compared. The accuracy of BTS in detecting breakthrough pain and neuropathic pain was analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 308 patients with cancer-related pain were screened and 233 were finally included in the analysis. The Pearson correlation coefficients of pain score for BTS and BPI (4 relevant questions) were 0.583 for the worst pain score within 24 h, 0.394 for the mildest pain score within 24 h, 0.551 for the average pain score within 24 h, and 0.511 for the current pain score, respectively (all P < 0.01), indicating a positive correlation between the BTS and BPI pain scores. BTS was superior to BPI for filling time, convenience, and patient preference (191.03 vs. 256.76, 7.70 vs. 6.78, 7.58 vs. 6.70; all P < 0.01). The accuracy of BTS in detecting breakthrough pain and neuropathic pain was 98.28% and 97.42%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Pain scores evaluated by BTS have a positive correlation with those evaluated by BPI. BTS reduces the filling time, is more convenient to use, and is more favored by patients. In addition, BTS could help identify breakthrough pain and neuropathic pain. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: Chictr.org.cn, identifier: ChiCTR220062624.
