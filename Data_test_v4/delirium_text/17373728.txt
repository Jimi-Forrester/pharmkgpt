17373728|t|A primate model for Alzheimer's disease: investigation of the apolipoprotein E profile of the vervet monkey of St. Kitts.
17373728|a|The apolipoprotein E4 allele has been previously associated with late onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). The major neuropathology of AD, senile (amyloid) plaques, and neurofibrillary tangles, has been observed in the vervet monkey (Chlorocebus aethiops). To further assess the suitability of the vervet as a model for AD, we undertook to determine the sequence of the vervet apoE exon 4 and to genotype an unrelated group of 30 aged animals raging from 15 to 28 years of age. All 30 animals were homozygous for the E4 allele.
