35982410|t|Higher serum PGE2 is a predicative biomarker for postoperative delirium following elective orthopedic surgery in elderly patients.
35982410|a|BACKGROUND: Postoperative delirium (POD), one of the most common complications following major surgery, imposes a heavy burden on patients and society. The objective of this exploratory study was to conduct a secondary analysis to identify whether there exist novel and reliable serum biomarkers for the prediction of POD. METHODS: A total of 131 adult patients (>= 65 years) undergoing lower extremity orthopedic surgery with were enrolled in this study. Cognitive function was assessed preoperatively with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Delirium was diagnosed according to the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) criteria on preoperative day and postoperative days 1-3. The preoperative serum levels of a panel of 16 biochemical parameters were measured by ELISA. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients developed POD, with an incidence of 26.7%. Patients in POD group were older (P = 0.001) and had lower preoperative MMSE scores (P = 0.001). Preoperative serum levels of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2, P < 0.001), S100beta (P < 0.001), glial fibrillary acidic protein (P < 0.001) and neurofilament light (P = 0.002) in POD group were significantly increased. Logistic regression analysis showed that advanced age (OR = 1.144, 95%CI: 1.008 ~ 1.298, P = 0.037), higher serum neurofilament light (OR = 1.003, 95%CI: 1.000 ~ 1.005, P = 0.036) and PGE2 (OR = 1.031, 95%CI: 1.018 ~ 1.044, P < 0.001) levels were associated with the development of POD. In addition, serum level of PGE2 yielded an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.897 to predict POD (P < 0.001), with a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 83.3%. CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that higher preoperative serum PGE2 level might be a biomarker to predict the occurrence of POD in elderly patients undergoing elective orthopedic surgery.
