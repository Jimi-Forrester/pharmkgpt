39240643|t|Enhancing Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis and Care by Focusing on Plasma Biomarkers for Identifying Mild Cognitive Impairment.
39240643|a|Biomarkers that accurately identify mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are of greater importance for Alzheimer's disease (AD) management and treatment. On the other hand, blood-based biomarkers are not only more practical but also less invasive than the common cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers. In their report in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease, Wang and collaborators identified 67 upregulated and 220 downregulated long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). They further demonstrated that 4 of these lncRNAs could discriminate MCI from cognitively healthy individuals. Apart from their significance as potential biomarkers for MCI diagnosis, these lncRNAs can offer additional information on the cellular mechanisms of AD pathology.
