39831009|t|Challenges in the management of visual and tactile hallucinations in elderly people.
39831009|a|This letter provides a concise review of the pertinent literature on visual and tactile hallucinations in elderly patients. The discussion addresses differential diagnoses and potential underlying mechanisms, as well as the psychopathology associated with tactile hallucinations, and emphasizes the necessity for investigation into the possibility of coexisting delusional infestation (parasitosis). These symptoms frequently manifest in patients with primary psychotic disorders, organic mental disorders, and substance use disorders. The proposed pathophysiological mechanisms may involve dopaminergic imbalances and dysfunction of the striatal dopamine transporter.
