39027235|t|Monoclonal antibodies and aptamers: The future therapeutics for Alzheimer's disease.
39027235|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is considered the most common and prevalent form of dementia of adult-onset with characteristic progressive impairment in cognition and memory. The cure for AD has not been found yet and the treatments available until recently were only symptomatic. Regardless of multidisciplinary approaches and efforts made by pharmaceutical companies, it was only in the past two years that new drugs were approved for the treatment of the disease. Amyloid beta (Abeta) immunotherapy is at the core of this therapy, which is one of the most innovative approaches looking to change the course of AD. This technology is based on synthetic peptides or monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to reduce Abeta levels in the brain and slow down the advance of neurodegeneration. Hence, this article reviews the state of the art about AD neuropathogenesis, the traditional pharmacologic treatment, as well as the modern active and passive immunization describing approved drugs, and drug prototypes currently under investigation in different clinical trials. In addition, future perspectives on immunotherapeutic strategies for AD and the rise of the aptamer technology as a non-immunogenic alternative to curb the disease progression are discussed.
