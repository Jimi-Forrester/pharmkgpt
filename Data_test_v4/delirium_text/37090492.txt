37090492|a|The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a clear ultrafiltrate of blood that envelopes and protects the central nervous system while regulating neuronal function through the maintenance of interstitial fluid homeostasis in the brain. Due to its anatomic location and physiological functions, the CSF can provide a reliable source of biomarkers for the diagnosis and treatment monitoring of different neurological diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and primary and secondary brain malignancies. The incorporation of CSF biomarkers into the drug discovery and development can improve the efficiency of drug development and increase the chances of success. This review aims to consolidate the current use of CSF biomarkers in clinical practice and explore future perspectives for the field.
