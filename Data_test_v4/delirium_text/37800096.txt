37800096|t|Olfactory function, neurofilament light chain, and cognitive trajectory: A 12-year follow-up of the Shanghai Aging Study.
37800096|a|This study aimed to determine whether blood neurofilament light chain (NfL) modifies the association of olfactory dysfunction (OD) with long-term cognitive decline. A total of 1125 non-demented older adults in the Shanghai Aging Study were evaluated for baseline olfaction (12-item Sniffin' Sticks Smell Test) and cognitive trajectory by a 12-year follow-up. Baseline blood NfL was quantified using Single Molecular Array assay, and dichotomized into low and high levels based on the median value of concentration. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status-40 were used to assess participants' cognitive function. Cognitive decline was ascertained when dementia was diagnosed or documented in the medical record during follow-up, or the MMSE declining rate (slope) was 1.0 SD larger than the group mean. OD participants presented a steeper trajectory of MMSE score (p interaction = 0.004) and a high risk of cognitive decline (adjusted HR [95% CI], 1.82 [1.11, 2.98]) only in those with high NfL. Participants with combined OD and high NfL showed the highest risk of cognitive decline (adjusted HR, 2.43 [1.20, 4.92]). OD, especially in combination with high blood NfL concentration, may be able to identify individuals who later incur cognitive deterioration.
