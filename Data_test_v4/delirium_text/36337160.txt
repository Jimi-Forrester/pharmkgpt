36337160|t|Imaging findings of two patients with isolated infarction of the splenium during COVID-19.
36337160|a|Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the virus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In the literature, this virus has been associated with coagulation dysfunction and arterial thromboembolism. In clinical practice, corpus callosum infarcts are very rare, and the incidence of isolated splenium infarct is very low. Here, two cases of isolated splenium infarct after COVID-19 are reported with clinical and imaging findings. These findings are thought to be useful in daily practice for our colleagues. In addition, differential diagnoses of this entity will also be discussed in this case report.
