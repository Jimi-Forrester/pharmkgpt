22262194|t|Serum levels of matrix metalloproteinases: implications in clinical neurology.
22262194|a|Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are zinc-dependent enzymes involved in remodeling extracellular matrix and cell-matrix interactions. A pathogenic role of MMPs in neurological disorders is likely. This paper focuses on serological clinical aspects only. In multiple sclerosis, higher serum MMP-3 is seen during relapses. Lower serum MMP-8 and -9 levels correlate with fewer contrast-enhanced T(2)-weighted MRI lesions, and serum MMP-9 can be used in monitoring treatment. In myasthenia gravis, serum MMP-2, -3, and -9 levels are elevated in both generalized and ocular diseases. A proportion of the patients have markedly increased serum MMP-3. In acute stroke, higher serum MMP-9 correlates with larger infarct volume, stroke severity, and worse functional outcome, and serum MMP-3 is significantly lower than in several other neurological disorders and healthy controls. In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, serum MMP-2 correlates with disease progression, and both serum MMP-1 and -2 are elevated. In Alzheimer's disease, serum MMP-3, -9, and -10 are elevated. In migraine, serum MMP-2 is elevated, and also MMP-9 in those patients with migraine without aura. MMP-9 is implicated in the pathogenesis of experimental epilepsy. A pathogenic role of MMPs in these conditions could be related to their ability to degrade extracellular matrix. MMPs may also facilitate autoimmunity.
