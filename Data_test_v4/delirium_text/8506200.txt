8506200|t|Blind drunk: alcoholic pancreatitis and loss of vision.
8506200|a|Acute loss of vision and alcoholic intoxication suggests the possibility of methanol poisoning. In this report we describe an alcoholic patient who complained of blindness after recovering from alcoholic pancreatitis and delirium tremens. Visual acuity was severely impaired and fundoscopy revealed florid bilateral cotton wool spots and a cherry red spot at the right macula. Such appearances have previously been reported in cases of post-traumatic visual loss, and may share a common aetiology of fat embolization. The association between alcoholic pancreatitis and visual loss is rare, and fundal examination should be performed on all patients with pancreatitis, especially those who complain of visual disturbance.
