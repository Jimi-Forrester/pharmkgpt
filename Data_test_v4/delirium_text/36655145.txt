36655145|t|Evaluation of Caralluma edulis for its Potential Against Obesity, Atherosclerosis and Hypertension.
36655145|a|Obesity, a chronic metabolic condition, is an increase in fat mass and blood lipid levels mainly causing atherosclerosis and hypertension, which further lead to cardiovascular complications. The objective of the study was to investigate the crude extract of Caralluma edulis (CE.Cr) for its potential against high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity and its related complications. Hyperlipidemia was induced in Wistar albino rats with HFD (1% cholesterol + 0.5% cholic acid) for 28 days. Treatment groups were administered with different doses of CE.Cr (100, 300 and 500 mg/Kg, p.o.) and the standard group received atorvastatin. At the end of study, sera were analyzed for biochemical markers and the aorta was dissected for microscopic examination. Antioxidant potential was evaluated and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis was performed. The hypotensive potential of CE.Cr was evaluated through an invasive technique. HPLC analysis of CE.Cr showed the presence of chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, apigenin and naringenin. Histological examination of the aorta section showed anti-atherosclerotic effects which were also evident from decrease in serum total cholesterol, triglycerides and low-density lipoproteins levels. CE.Cr decreased mean arterial blood pressure and evoked significant hypotensive effects. The crude extract of C. edulis showed anti-obesity, antihypertensive, anti-atherosclerotic and antioxidant potential.
