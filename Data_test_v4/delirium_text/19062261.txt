19062261|t|Serum creatine kinase activity differentiates alcohol syndromes of dependence, withdrawal and delirium tremens.
19062261|a|Previous reports described significant differences in serum creatine kinase (CK) activity in bipolar disorder and various forms of depression. The comorbidity of depression and alcohol syndromes was also widely described. We aim to examine potential differences in serum CK level in different alcohol-related syndromes. We assessed morning serum CK activity in 114 inpatients, diagnosed by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV: Fifty-five subjects with alcohol dependence, 28 with alcohol withdrawal and 31 with delirium tremens (DT's). We found low normal CK activity for the alcohol dependence, higher for alcohol withdrawal and the highest for DT's. Peripheral CK activity of four patients that were admitted during each of the three phases showed similar pattern. These findings may be related to enhanced dopamine activity in alcohol dependence and conversely, to a significant decrease in dopamine activity during withdrawal syndromes. We suggest a supplementary simple laboratory tool for the detection of alcohol-related states.
