30845753|t|Adaptation and Validation of the Hydration Status Questionnaire in a Spanish Adolescent-Young Population: A Cross Sectional Study.
30845753|a|The achievement of adequate hydration status is essential for mental and physical performance and for health in general, especially in children and adolescents. Nevertheless, little is known about hydration status of this population, mainly due to the limited availability of research tools; thus, the objective of the current study was to adapt and validate our hydration status questionnaire in a Spanish adolescent-young population. The questionnaire was validated against important hydration markers: urine colour, urine specific gravity, haemoglobin, haematocrit and total body water and involved 128 subjects aged between 12-17 years. Water intake was also estimated through a three-day dietary record and physical activity was assessed through accelerometers. Participants completed the questionnaire twice. Water balance and water intake were correlated with urine specific gravity and with total body water content. Water intake obtained by the questionnaire was correlated with results from the three-day dietary record. The intraclass correlation coefficient indicated moderate concordance between both recordings and the Cronbach's alpha revealed high consistency. The Bland and Altman method indicated that the limits of agreement were acceptable to reveal the reliability of the estimated measures. In conclusion, this is the first time that a questionnaire is valid and reliable to estimate hydration status of adolescent-young populations.
