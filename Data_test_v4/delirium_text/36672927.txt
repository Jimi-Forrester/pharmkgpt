36672927|t|Analyses of lncRNAs, circRNAs, and the Interactions between ncRNAs and mRNAs in Goat Submandibular Glands Reveal Their Potential Function in Immune Regulation.
36672927|a|As part of one of the main ruminants, goat salivary glands hardly secrete digestive enzymes, but play an important role in immunity. The immune function of goat salivary glands significantly changes with age, while the expression profile and specific function of non-coding RNA during this process are unknown. In this study, transcriptome sequencing was performed on submandibular gland (SMG) tissues of 1-month-old, 12-month-old, and 24-month-old goats, revealing the expression patterns of lncRNA and circRNA at different ages. A total of 369 lncRNAs and 1699 circRNAs were found to be differentially expressed. Functional enrichment analyses showed that the lncRNA regulated target mRNAs and circRNA host genes were significantly enriched in immune-related GO terms and pathways. CeRNA network analysis showed that the key differentially expressed circRNAs and lncRNAs mainly regulate the key immune-related genes ITGB2, LCP2, PTPRC, SYK, and ZAP70 through competitive binding with miR-141-x, miR-29-y, and chi-miR-29b-3p, thereby affecting the natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity pathway, the T cell receptor signaling pathway, and other immune-related pathways. It should be noted that the expression of key circRNAs, lncRNAs, and key immune-related genes in goat SMGs decreased significantly with the growth of the goat. This is the first reporting of lncRNAs, circRNAs, and ceRNA network regulation in goat SMGs. Our study contributes to the knowledge of changes in the expression of non-coding RNAs during SMG development in goats and provides new insights into the relationship between non-coding RNAs and salivary gland immune function in goats.
