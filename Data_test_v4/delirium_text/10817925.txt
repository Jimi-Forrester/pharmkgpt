10817925|t|Oxidative damage in Alzheimer's disease: the metabolic dimension.
10817925|a|Cell bodies of neurons at risk of death in Alzheimer disease have increased lipid peroxidation, nitration, free carbonyls, and nucleic acid oxidation. These oxidative changes are uniform among neurons and are seen whether or not the neurons display neurofibrillary tangles and, in fact, are acutally reduced in the latter case. In consideration of this localization of damage, in this review, we provide a summary of recent work demonstrating some key abnormalities that may initiate and promote neuronal oxidatave damage.
