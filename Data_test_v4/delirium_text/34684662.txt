34684662|a|There have been many reports on the neuroprotective effects of Hericium erinaceus mycelium, in which the most well-known active compounds found are diterpenoids, such as erinacine A. Previously, erinacine A-enriched Hericeum erinaceus mycelium (EAHEM) was shown to decrease amyloid plaque aggregation and improve cognitive disability in Alzheimer's disease model APP/PS1 mice. However, its effects on brain aging have not yet been touched upon. Here, we used senescence accelerated mouse prone 8 (SAMP8) mice as a model to elucidate the mechanism by which EAHEM delays the aging of the brain. Three-month-old SAMP8 mice were divided into three EAHEM dosage groups, administered at 108, 215 and 431 mg/kg/BW/day, respectively. During the 12th week of EAHEM feeding, learning and memory of the mice were evaluated by single-trial passive avoidance and active avoidance test. After sacrifice, the amyloid plaques, induced nitric oxidase synthase (iNOS) activity, thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) and 8-OHdG levels were analyzed. We found that the lowest dose of 108 mg/kg/BW EAHEM was sufficient to significantly improve learning and memory in the passive and active avoidance tests. In all three EAHEM dose groups, iNOS, TBARS and 8-OHdG levels all decreased significantly and showed a dose-dependent response. The results indicate that EAHEM improved learning and memory and delayed degenerative aging in mice brains.
