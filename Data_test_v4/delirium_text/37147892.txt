37147892|t|Preoperative slow-wave sleep is associated with postoperative delirium after heart valve surgery: A prospective pilot study.
37147892|a|Postoperative delirium (POD) is a very common neurological complication after valve surgery. Some studies have shown that preoperative sleep disorder is associated with POD, but the correlation between preoperative slow wave sleep (SWS) and POD remains unclear. Therefore, this study aims to identify the correlation between preoperative slow wave sleep and postoperative delirium in patients with heart valve disease. This was a prospective, observational study of elective valve surgery patients admitted to the Heart Medical Center between November 2021 and July 2022. Polysomnography (PSG) was used to monitor sleep architecture from 9:30 p.m. for 1 night before surgery to 6:30 a.m. on the day of surgery. Patients were assessed for postoperative delirium from postoperative day 1 to extubation or day 5 by using the Richmond Agitation/Sedation Scale (RASS) and the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU). A total of 60 elective valve surgery patients were enrolled in this study. Prolonged N1 (11.44%) and N2 (58.62%) sleep, decreased N3 sleep (8.75%) and REM sleep (18.24%) within normal limits were the overall sleep architecture. Compared with patients without POD, patients with POD had less slow wave sleep 1 night before surgery (5.77% vs 10.88%, p < 0.001). After adjusting for confounding factors, slow wave sleep (OR: 0.647, 95% CI 0.493-0.851, p = 0.002) was found to be a protective factor for postoperative delirium. The preoperative SWS is a predictive factor of the POD in patients undergoing valve surgery. But further studies with larger sample sizes are still needed to elucidate the relationship between preoperative slow wave sleep and postoperative delirium.
