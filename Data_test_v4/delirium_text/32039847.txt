32039847|a|Blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability is a recognized early feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the present study, we examined consequences of increased BBB permeability on the development of AD-related pathology by tracking selected leaked plasma components and their interactions with neurons in vivo and in vitro. Histological sections of cortical regions of postmortem AD brains were immunostained to determine the distribution of amyloid-beta1-42 (Abeta42), cathepsin D, IgG, GluR2/3, and alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (alpha7nAChR). Results revealed that chronic IgG binding to pyramidal neurons coincided with internalization of Abeta42, IgG, GluR2/3, and alpha7nAChR as well as lysosomal compartment expansion in these cells in regions of AD pathology. To test possible mechanistic interrelationships of these phenomena, we exposed differentiated SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells to exogenous, soluble Abeta42 peptide and serum from AD and control subjects. The rate and extent of Abeta42 internalization in these cells was enhanced by serum containing neuron-binding IgG autoantibodies. This was confirmed by treating cells with individual antibodies specific for alpha7nAChR, purified IgG from AD or non-AD sera, and sera devoid of IgG, in the presence of 100 nM Abeta42. Initial co-localization of IgG, alpha7nAChR, and Abeta42 was temporally and spatially linked to early endosomes (Rab11) and later to lysosomes (LAMP-1). Abeta42 internalization was attenuated by treatment with monovalent F(ab) antibody fragments generated from purified IgG from AD serum and then rescued by coupling F(ab) fragments with divalent human anti-Fab. Overall, results suggest that cross-linking of neuron-binding autoantibodies targeting cell surface proteins can accelerate intraneuronal Abeta42 deposition in AD.
