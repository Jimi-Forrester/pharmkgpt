18046877|t|Citicoline (Cognizin) in the treatment of cognitive impairment.
18046877|a|Pharmacological treatment of cerebrovascular disorders was introduced at the beginning of the 20th Century. Since then, a multitude of studies have focused on the development of a consensus for a well defined taxonomy of these disorders and on the identification of specific patterns of cognitive deficits associated with them, but with no clear consensus. Nevertheless, citicoline has proved to be a valid treatment in patients with a cerebrovascular pathogenesis for memory disorders. A metanalysis performed on the entire database available from the clinical studies performed with this compound confirms the experimental evidence from the animal studies which have repeatedly described the multiple biological actions of citicoline in restoring both the cell lipid structures and some neurotransmitter functions.
