32573256|a|Understanding Alzheimer's disease (AD) dynamics is essential in diagnosis and measuring progression for clinical decision-making; however, clinical instruments are imperfect at classifying true disease stages. This research evaluates sensitivity and determinants of AD stage changes longitudinally using current classifications of "mild," "moderate," and "severe" AD, using Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog), and the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) thresholds. Age and pre-progression rate were significant determinants of AD progression using MMSE alone to stage AD, and pre-progression was found to impact disease progression with CDR-SB. Sensitivity of these instruments for identifying clinical stages of AD to correctly staging a "moderate" level of disease severity for outcomes MMSE, CDR-SB, and ADAS-Cog was 92%, 78%, and 92%, respectively. This research derives longitudinal sensitivity of clinical instruments used to stage AD useful for clinical decision-making. The MMSE and ADAS-Cog provided adequate sensitivity to classify AD stages.
