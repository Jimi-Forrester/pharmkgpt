27884599|a|The hallmark characteristics of plaque formation and neuronal cell death in Alzheimer's disease (AD) are caused principally by the amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta). Abeta sequence and lipid composition are essential variables to consider when elucidating the impact of biological membranes on Abeta structure and the effect of Abeta on membrane integrity. Atomistic molecular dynamics simulations testing two Abeta sequences, human and rat Abeta (HAbeta and RAbeta, respectively), and five lipid types were performed to assess the effect of these variables on membrane perturbation and potential link to AD phenotype differences based on differences in sequence. All metrics agree insomuch that monomeric HAbeta and RAbeta contribute to membrane perturbation by causing a more rigid, gel-like lipid phase. Differences between HAbeta and RAbeta binding on degree of membrane perturbation were based on lipid headgroup properties. Cholesterol was found to moderate the amount of perturbation caused by HAbeta and RAbeta in a model raft membrane. The difference in position of an arginine residue between HAbeta and RAbeta influenced peptide-membrane interactions and was determined to be the mediating factor in observed differences in lipid affinity and degree of membrane disruption. Overall, this work increases our understanding of the influence of sequence and lipid type on Abeta-membrane interactions and their relationship to AD.
