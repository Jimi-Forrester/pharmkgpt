22343156|a|BACKGROUND: The neuropeptide oxytocin, produced in the supraoptic (SON) and paraventricular nuclei (PVN) of the hypothalamus, is now understood to function as a neurotransmitter critical for various aspects of social cognition and pro-social behaviour. While patients with Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) display prominent and progressive deficits in such social behaviours, the integrity of these nuclei in FTD is not known. METHODS: We conducted a quantitative neuropathologic examination of the SON and PVN from patients with FTLD with TDP-43 proteinopathy, Alzheimer's disease, Lewy body disease and controls to determine whether significant pathologic changes or neuronal loss may contribute to the striking behavioural symptoms of FTD. RESULTS: Contrary to predictions, we found both nuclei to be free of significant pathologic change (TDP-43) in FTLD. In contrast, tau related pathology was found in the PVN in Alzheimer's disease, and alpha-synuclein pathology in the SON in patients with Lewy body dementia. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that the SON and PVN are resistant to FTLD TDP-43 pathology. They also support prior suggestions that the SON is resistant to Alzheimer's disease (AD) related pathology, and extend this to demonstrate SON susceptibility to alpha-synuclein pathology in patients with Lewy body dementia.
