18484674|a|OBJECTIVE: To estimate the effect of education on the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: 373 patients diagnosed with AD and 559 healthy control individuals without first degree relatives with known dementia, were included in a case-control study (2003-2006). All individuals were genotyped for APOE alleles. Odds ratio (OR) for developing AD was calculated by binary logistic regression, with the number of APOE epsilon 4 alleles and educational level as covariates. Analyses were carried out separately for men and women and for different age groups. RESULTS: Carriers of one APOE epsilon 4 allele had OR of 4.2, and carriers of two APOE epsilon 4 alleles OR of 12.4 for developing AD. When adjusted for the number of APOE epsilon 4 alleles, OR for developing AD was significantly reduced in participants with 8-9 years of education compared to those with only 6-7 years, and was reduced further for those with 10-18 years of education. These findings were obtained for all the age groups studied and for both men and women. CONCLUSIONS: Education had a consistently protective effect on the risk of developing clinical AD in a dose-dependent manner in both men and women, and in all age groups, also when adjusting for the number of APOE epsilon 4 alleles. Male gender was protective, probably at least in part because of a higher educational level.
