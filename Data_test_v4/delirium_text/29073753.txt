29073753|t|Lithium Intoxication: A Possible Interaction with Moxifloxacin.
29073753|a|Lithium is a well-known treatment for patients with mood disorders. Intoxication by lithium may be lethal particularly in elderly due to altered pharmacokinetics, renal impairment or multiple drug use. We presented a 74-year-old female patient who had been stabile with lithium carbonate 600 mg/day for 5 years and developed lithium intoxication after bronchiolitis. She presented with altered mental status. The neurological signs resolved slowly after lithium and moxifloxacin were stopped immediately and fluid resuscitation administered. Considering possible drug interactions on elderly patients receiving lithium is essential.
