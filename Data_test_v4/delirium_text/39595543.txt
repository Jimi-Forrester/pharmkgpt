39595543|a|Individuals affected by neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), are dramatically increasing worldwide. Thus, several efforts are being made to develop strategies for stopping or slowing the spread of these illnesses. Although causative genetic variants linked to the onset of these diseases are known, they can explain only a small portion of cases. The etiopathology underlying the neurodegenerative process in most of the patients is likely due to the interplay between predisposing genetic variants and environmental factors. Epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation, are central candidates in translating the effects of environmental factors in genome modulation, and they play a critical role in the etiology of AD, PD, and ALS. Among the main environmental exposures that have been linked to an increased risk for these diseases, accumulating evidence points to the role of heavy metals, pesticides, and air pollutants. These compounds could trigger neurodegeneration through different mechanisms, mainly neuroinflammation and the induction of oxidative stress. However, increasing evidence suggests that they are also capable of inducing epigenetic alterations in neurons. In this article, we review the available literature linking exposure to metals, pesticides, and air pollutants to DNA methylation changes relevant to neurodegeneration.
