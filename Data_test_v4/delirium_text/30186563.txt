30186563|a|OBJECTIVES: Chronic stress has been linked to the pathophysiology of mood disorders including anxiety and depression. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of troxerutin (TRX), as a flavonol, on stress-induced anxiety and depression. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 56 animals were randomly divided into seven groups (n=8 per group) as follows: control, saline, TRX 50, TRX 150, TRX 300, Diazepam, and Imipramine. Chronic mild stress (CMS) was induced by restraining animals in Plexiglas cylinders for 1 hr each day for 25 consecutive days. Different doses (50, 150, and 300 mg/kg, oral gavage) of troxerutin was gavaged for 14 consecutive days. At the end of treatments, anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors were tested using elevated plus-maze (EPM), open field test (OFT), and forced swimming test (FST). RESULTS: CMS significantly increased immobility (P<0.05) and decreased swimming (P<0.01) time in FST. However, different doses of troxerutin significantly decreased immobility (P<0.01) and increased swimming (P<0.001) time. CMS also significantly (P<0.01) decreased the percentage of open arm entrance (%OAE), whereas troxerutin significantly increased both %OAE and percentage of open arm time (%OAT) in the EPM. Moreover, CMS significantly decreased time spent in the center (P<0.001) and the number of center entrances (P<0.01) in the OFT. However, troxerutin significantly increased time spent in the center and number of the entrances crossing. Furthermore, CMS significantly increased serum cortisol levels and troxerutin decreased it. CONCLUSION: Troxerutin demonstrated anxiolytic- and antidepressant-like activities in rodents, which supports the use of herbal medicine in the mood disorders.
