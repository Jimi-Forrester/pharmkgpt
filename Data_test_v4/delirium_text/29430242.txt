29430242|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the gustatory function in patients with semantic dementia (SD). METHODS: Detection and recognition thresholds of the 4 basic tastes (sweet, salty, sour, and bitter), taste discrimination, and taste identification were evaluated in 18 patients with SD, 18 patients with Alzheimer disease (AD), and 22 healthy controls. RESULTS: Total detection and recognition threshold values were significantly higher in the SD and AD groups than in the control group. Patients with early-stage SD (Clinical Dementia Rating Scale score 0.5) exhibited significantly higher detection and recognition thresholds relative to controls, while increases in recognition threshold were only noted in patients with AD. Patients with SD exhibited significantly higher thresholds for the detection of sweet and salty tastes and the recognition of salty, sour, and bitter tastes, while patients with AD exhibited significantly higher thresholds only for the recognition of salty and sour tastes. Taste discrimination was preserved, whereas taste identification was disturbed, in both the SD and AD groups. CONCLUSIONS: Gustatory dysfunction at both the sensory and semantic levels may be among the early symptoms of SD. Although patients with SD had difficulty detecting sweet tastes, they more easily recognized these tastes than others, which may explain their strong preference for sweets.
