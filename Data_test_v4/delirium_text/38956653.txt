38956653|a|BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) are mutual risk factors, with both conditions inducing cognitive impairment and anxiety. However, whether OSA exacerbates cognitive impairment and anxiety in patients with T2DM remains unclear. Moreover, TREM2 upregulation has been suggested to play a protective role in attenuating microglia activation and improving synaptic function in T2DM mice. The aim of this study was to explore the regulatory mechanisms of TREM2 and the cognitive and anxiety-like behavioral changes in mice with OSA combined with T2DM. METHODS: A T2DM with OSA model was developed by treating mice with a 60% kcal high-fat diet (HFD) combined with intermittent hypoxia (IH). Spatial learning memory capacity and anxiety in mice were investigated. Neuronal damage in the brain was determined by the quantity of synapses density, the number and morphology of brain microglia, and pro-inflammatory factors. For mechanism exploration, an in vitro model of T2DM combined with OSA was generated by co-treating microglia with high glucose (HG) and IH. Regulation of TREM2 on IFNAR1-STAT1 pathway was determined by RNA sequencing and qRT-PCR. RESULTS: Our results showed that HFD mice exhibited significant cognitive dysfunction and anxiety-like behavior, accompanied by significant synaptic loss. Furthermore, significant activation of brain microglia and enhanced microglial phagocytosis of synapses were observed. Moreover, IH was found to significantly aggravate anxiety in the HFD mice. The mechanism of HG treatment may potentially involve the promotion of TREM2 upregulation, which in turn attenuates the proinflammatory microglia by inhibiting the IFNAR1-STAT1 pathway. Conversely, a significant reduction in TREM2 in IH-co-treated HFD mice and HG-treated microglia resulted in the further activation of the IFNAR1-STAT1 pathway and consequently increased proinflammatory microglial activation. CONCLUSIONS: HFD upregulated the IFNAR1-STAT1 pathway and induced proinflammatory microglia, leading to synaptic damage and causing anxiety and cognitive deficits. The upregulated TREM2 inT2DM mice brain exerted a negative regulation of the IFNAR1-STAT1 pathway. Mice with T2DM combined with OSA exacerbated anxiety via the downregulation of TREM2, causing heightened IFNAR1-STAT1 pathway activation and consequently increasing proinflammatory microglia.
