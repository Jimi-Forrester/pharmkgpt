39035239|t|Catatonia: A Narrative Review for Hospitalists.
39035239|a|Background: Catatonia is a complex psychomotor syndrome commonly associated with psychiatric disorders. However, hospitalists encounter this condition on medical floors, where it is typically due to an underlying medical, especially neurological, etiology. Delays in the diagnosis of catatonia are common and lead to worsened outcomes for patients, including a multitude of medical complications, such as venous thromboembolism and stasis ulcers. Catatonia due to a medical condition is less likely to respond to benzodiazepine therapy; identification and treatment of the underlying cause is crucial. Methods: This article provides a practical review of the catatonia literature, with a focus on diagnosis, workup, and management of catatonia for patients admitted to medical hospitals. Conclusions: With greater knowledge about catatonia, internists are uniquely positioned to recognize and initiate treatment.
