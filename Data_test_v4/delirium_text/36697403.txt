36697403|a|A correlation between COVID-19 and Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been proposed recently. Although the number of case reports on neuroinflammation in COVID-19 patients has increased, studies of SARS-CoV-2 neurotrophic pathology using brain organoids have restricted recapitulation of those phenotypes due to insufficiency of immune cells and absence of vasculature. Cerebral pericytes and endothelial cells, the major components of blood-brain barrier, express viral entry receptors for SARS-CoV-2 and response to systemic inflammation including direct cell death. To overcome the limitations, we developed cortical-blood vessel assembloids by fusing cortical organoid with blood vessel organoid to provide vasculature to brain organoids a nd obtained the characteristics of increased expression of microglia and astrocytes in brain organoids. Furthermore, we observed AD pathologies, including beta-amyloid plaques, which were affected by the inflammatory response from SARS-CoV-2 infection. These findings provide an advanced platform to investigate human neurotrophic diseases, including COVID-19, and suggest that neuroinflammation caused by viral infection facilitates AD pathology.
