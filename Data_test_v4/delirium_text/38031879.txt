38031879|a|Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG), hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), and the associated autoinflammatory syndromes, including pyogenic arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum, and acne (PAPA) syndrome, PSTPIP1-associated myeloid-related proteinemia inflammatory (PAMI) syndrome, pyoderma gangrenosum, acne, and hidradenitis suppurativa (PASH) syndrome, and pyogenic arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum, acne, and suppurative hidradenitis (PAPASH) syndrome are dermatological conditions characterized by chronic inflammation and tissue damage. Recent advances in genetic research have identified specific mutations associated with these disorders, shedding light on their underlying pathogenic mechanisms. This review aims to summarize the current knowledge of identified mutations and presumed pathophysiology in PG, HS, and the associated autoinflammatory syndromes.
