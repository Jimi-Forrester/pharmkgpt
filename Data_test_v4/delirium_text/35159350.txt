35159350|t|Dynamic Spatiotemporal Expression Pattern of the Senescence-Associated Factor p16Ink4a in Development and Aging.
35159350|a|A plethora of factors have been attributed to underly aging, including oxidative stress, telomere shortening and cellular senescence. Several studies have shown a significant role of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p16ink4a in senescence and aging. However, its expression in development has been less well documented. Therefore, to further clarify a potential role of p16 in development and aging, we conducted a developmental expression study of p16, as well as of p19ARF and p21, and investigated their expression on the RNA level in brain, heart, liver, and kidney of mice at embryonic, postnatal, adult, and old ages. P16 expression was further assessed on the protein level by immunohistochemistry. Expression of p16 was highly dynamic in all organs in embryonic and postnatal stages and increased dramatically in old mice. Expression of p19 and p21 was less variable and increased to a moderate extent at old age. In addition, we observed a predominant expression of p16 mRNA and protein in liver endothelial cells versus non-endothelial cells of old mice, which suggests a functional role specifically in liver endothelium of old subjects. Thus, p16 dynamic spatiotemporal expression might implicate p16 in developmental and physiological processes in addition to its well-known function in the build-up of senescence.
