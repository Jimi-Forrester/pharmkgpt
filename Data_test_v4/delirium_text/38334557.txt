38334557|t|Intracranial Gene Delivery Mediated by Albumin-Based Nanobubbles and Low-Frequency Ultrasound.
38334557|a|Research in the field of high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) for intracranial gene therapy has greatly progressed over the years. However, limitations of conventional HIFU still remain. That is, genes are required to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in order to reach the neurological disordered lesion. In this study, we introduce a novel direct intracranial gene delivery method, bypassing the BBB using human serum albumin-based nanobubbles (NBs) injected through a less invasive intrathecal route via lumbar puncture, followed by intracranial irradiation with low-frequency ultrasound (LoFreqUS). Focusing on both plasmid DNA (pDNA) and messenger RNA (mRNA), our approach utilizes LoFreqUS for deeper tissue acoustic penetration and enhancing gene transfer efficiency. This drug delivery method could be dubbed as the "Spinal Back-Door Approach", an alternative to the "front door" BBB opening method. Experiments showed that NBs effectively responded to LoFreqUS, significantly improving gene transfer in vitro using U-87 MG cell lines. In vivo experiments in mice demonstrated significantly increased gene expression with pDNA; however, we were unable to obtain conclusive results using mRNA. This novel technique, combining albumin-based NBs and LoFreqUS offers a promising, efficient, targeted, and non-invasive solution for central nervous system gene therapy, potentially transforming the treatment landscape for neurological disorders.
