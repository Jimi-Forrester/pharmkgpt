37937160|a|INTRODUCTION: Motoric cognitive risk syndrome (MCR) is a predementia syndrome that is characterized by cognitive complaints and slow gait. Cardiometabolic multimorbidity (CMM) is associated with an increased risk of dementia. However, the relationship between CMM and MCR is still unclear. METHODS: We included 4744 participants (aged 65+ years) without MCR at baseline from the National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS), who were followed-up from 2011 to 2018. CMM was defined as the presence of two or more cardiometabolic diseases (including diabetes mellitus, heart disease, and stroke). RESULTS: CMM was significantly associated with an increased risk of MCR (hazard ratio [HR] 1.41, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.13-1.75) in fully adjusted models. Consistent results were observed from stratified analyses of different subgroups. Increasing numbers of cardiometabolic diseases were dose-dependently associated with increased MCR risk (HR 1.33, 95% CI 1.20-1.48). DISCUSSION: CMM is associated with an increased risk of MCR in older adults. HIGHLIGHTS: Motoric cognitive risk syndrome (MCR) is a predementia syndrome characterized by slow gait speed and cognitive complaints.Cardiometabolic multimorbidity was associated with an increased MCR risk.An increased number of cardiometabolic diseases were dose-dependently associated with increased MCR risk.
