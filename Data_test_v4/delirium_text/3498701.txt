3498701|t|Topographical analysis of glucose metabolism, as measured with positron emission tomography, in dementia of the Alzheimer type: use of linear histograms.
3498701|a|A linear histogram method was employed to analyze brain images of glucose uptake obtained by positron emission tomography in patients with dementia of the Alzheimer type and in control subjects. A line was drawn by computer which traversed the image of a brain slice taken at 70 mm above and parallel to the inferior orbitomeatal line, and rCMRglc was plotted as a function of distance along this line in 3 brain areas: frontal, sensorimotor and parietal. Peak rCMRglc values were significantly decreased in moderately-to-severely demented patients relative to healthy age-matched controls, but not in mildly demented patients. Furthermore, both the mildly and the more severely demented patients differed from controls in having reduced ratios of parietal association to sensorimotor peak rCMRglc. The variances of right-left metabolic asymmetries did not differ significantly between Alzheimer patients and controls. Severity of dementia, as evaluated by scores on the Mini-Mental State Examination, correlated with ratios of peak rCMRglc in frontal and parietal cortex to that in sensorimotor cortex. These results indicate that measures of focal peak rCMRglc do not discriminate between mildly demented patients and controls, whereas focal ratios of rCMRglc, where the denominator corresponds to rCMRglc from a relatively spared region, provide useful measures of metabolic dysfunction in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease.
