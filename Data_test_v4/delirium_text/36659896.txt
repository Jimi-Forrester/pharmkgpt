36659896|a|Introduction: Knee dislocations are an uncommon complication following total knee arthroplasty (TKA). There are many causes of TKA dislocation; however, Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome is one uncommon neurologic condition that increases the risk of TKA dislocation. Case Report: A 71-year-old male with presented to a local community hospital with knee pain due to advanced osteoarthritis of the knee and subsequently underwent an uncomplicated TKA with a cruciate retaining prosthesis. He eventually returned to the hospital due to infection, medical instability, chronic knee instability, and posterior tibiofemoral dislocation. A revision process was required. Throughout the course of management, the patient had altered mental status and was admitted to the intensive care unit. The first procedure involved removing the cruciate retaining prosthesis and replacing it with a static cement antibiotic spacer. This prosthesis was eventually dislocated through the tibia and a second procedure requiring the placement of an intercalary fusion was needed. The patient has not followed up after the hospital admission. Conclusion: Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome is an uncommon condition that affects alcoholics and complicates treatment with joint replacement surgery. Patients with Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome provide a unique set of challenges that may require multiple surgeries and varying prostheses. Chronic posterior tibiofemoral dislocation is one specific complication that may affect the management of these patients. As orthopedic surgeons, it is important to consider alcohol use disorder and Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome when treating patients with total joint replacement.
