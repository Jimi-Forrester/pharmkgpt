3024794|a|Three patients with clinical Alzheimer's disease were found at postmortem examination to have Lewy-bodies and Lewy-like bodies in the cerebral cortex and the pigmented brainstem nuclei. Neuritic plaques were found in neocortical areas but no neurofibrillary tangles. The distribution of cortical neuronal inclusions correlated with the proposed projection of dopamine terminals. Neuronal cell loss was marked in the ventral tegmental area (paranigral nucleus) and the basal nucleus of Meynert, suggesting a defect in dopaminergic and cholinergic innervation of the cerebral cortex. Immunohistochemical investigations revealed positive staining of cortical Lewy- and Lewy-like bodies for monoclonal antibodies to phosphorylated neurofilaments (03-44, 06-17, 04-7). Also cerebral neurons containing no inclusions showed positivity, suggesting an early neurofilament abnormality, preceding the formation of Lewy-type inclusions.
