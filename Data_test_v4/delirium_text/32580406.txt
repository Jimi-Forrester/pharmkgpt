32580406|a|Despite extensive efforts in the development of drugs for complex neurodegenerative diseases, treatment often remains challenging or ineffective, and hence new treatment strategies are necessary. One approach is the design of multi-target drugs, which can potentially address the complex nature of disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. We report a method for high throughput virtual screening aimed at identifying new dual target hit molecules. One of the identified hits, N,N-dimethyl-1-(4-(3-methyl-[1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-a]pyrimidin-6-yl)phenyl)ethan-1-amine (Y;mir-2), has dual-activity as an acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor and as an alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (alpha7 nAChR) agonist. Using computational chemistry methods, parallel and independent screening of a virtual compound library consisting of 3,848,234 drug-like and commercially available molecules from the ZINC15 database, resulted in an intersecting set of 57 compounds, that potentially possess activity at both of the two protein targets. Based on ligand efficiency as well as scaffold and molecular diversity, 16 of these compounds were purchased for in vitro validation by Ellman's method and two-electrode voltage-clamp electrophysiology. Y;mir-2 was shown to exhibit the desired activity profile (AChE IC50 = 2.58 +- 0.96 microM; alpha7 nAChR activation = 7.0 +- 0.9% at 200 microM) making it the first reported compound with this particular profile and providing further evidence of the feasibility of in silico methods for the identification of novel multi-target hit molecules.
