38583416|a|INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study is to evaluate the features and benefits of different geriatric screening tools for enhancing the perioperative care of patients who undergo elective cancer surgery using cluster analysis. METHODS: This study was a retrospective, observational analysis of 1019 consecutive patients who had elective major cancer surgery in the urology department of our hospital from October 2019 to January 2023. Before the surgery, a trained nurse screened the patients using six tools: Eastern Clinical Oncology Group performance status (ECOG-PS), flemish version of the triage risk screening tool (fTRST), geriatric-8 (G8), instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), patient health questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2), and simple questionnaire to rapidly diagnose sarcopenia (SARC-F). The study grouped the patients into four clusters based on their scores on these tools and compared their outcomes after the surgery. The outcomes included overall survival, ambulation failure, delirium, and severe complications. The study also examined how each screening tool was associated with the outcomes. RESULTS: Based on their clinical data and screening results, we classified the patients into four groups: Healthy (73%), Depressive (11%), Intermediate (11%), and Unhealthy (5%). The Unhealthy group had the worst outcomes in overall survival (OS), ambulation failure, and delirium, followed by the Intermediate group. In addition, fTRST and SARC-F emerged as significant predictors of OS; ECOG-PS, fTRST, G8 and SARC-F of ambulation failure; ECOG-PS, fTRST and G8 of delirium; and G8 of severe complications. CONCLUSION: Various geriatric screening tools were found to have the potential to forecast diverse postoperative outcomes.
