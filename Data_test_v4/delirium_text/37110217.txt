37110217|t|Quality Control of Targeted Plasma Lipids in a Large-Scale Cohort Study Using Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry.
37110217|a|High-throughput metabolomics has enabled the development of large-scale cohort studies. Long-term studies require multiple batch-based measurements, which require sophisticated quality control (QC) to eliminate unexpected bias to obtain biologically meaningful quantified metabolomic profiles. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to analyze 10,833 samples in 279 batch measurements. The quantified profile included 147 lipids including acylcarnitine, fatty acids, glucosylceramide, lactosylceramide, lysophosphatidic acid, and progesterone. Each batch included 40 samples, and 5 QC samples were measured for 10 samples of each. The quantified data from the QC samples were used to normalize the quantified profiles of the sample data. The intra- and inter-batch median coefficients of variation (CV) among the 147 lipids were 44.3% and 20.8%, respectively. After normalization, the CV values decreased by 42.0% and 14.7%, respectively. The effect of this normalization on the subsequent analyses was also evaluated. The demonstrated analyses will contribute to obtaining unbiased, quantified data for large-scale metabolomics.
