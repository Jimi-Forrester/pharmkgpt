26437547|t|[Incidence, Risk Factors, and Effects on Outcome of Postoperative Delirium in Patients Undergoing Esophagectomy].
26437547|a|BACKGROUND: Postoperative delirium (POD) is a common but serious complication after major surgery. The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence and effects on outcome of POD in esophagectomy patients, and to identify risk factors for developing POD. METHODS: A retrospective medical record review was conducted for all patients who had received esophagectomy for esophageal cancer during a three-year period. RESULTS: In a total of 71 patients, the overall incidence of POD was 20%. Multivariable regression analysis identified two independent risk factors for POD: older age (70) and preoperative electrolyte abnormalities. Patients with delirium had a higher incidence of respiratory complications and longer hospital stays compared with the non-delirium patients. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of POD in patients undergoing esophagectomy is 20%. The risk factors of POD are older age and preoperative electrolyte abnormalities. POD negatively impacts postoperative respiratory complications and hospital stay.
