35005661|a|AIM: Early identification of patients at risk of serious adverse events (SAEs) is of vital importance, yet it remains a challenging task. We investigated the predictive power of National Early Warning Score (NEWS) 2, as compared to NEWS, among patients assessed by a Rapid response team (RRT). METHODS: Prospective, observational cohort study on 898 consecutive patients assessed by the RRTs in 26 Swedish hospitals. For each patient, NEWS and NEWS 2 scores were uniformly calculated by the study team. The associations of NEWS and NEWS 2 scores with unanticipated admissions to Intensive care unit (ICU), mortality and in-hospital cardiac arrests (IHCA) within 24 h, and the composite of these three events were investigated using logistic regression. The predictive power of NEWS and NEWS 2 was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curves. RESULTS: The prognostic accuracy of NEWS/NEWS 2 in predicting mortality was acceptable (AUROC 0.69/0.67). In discriminating the composite outcome and unanticipated ICU admission, both NEWS and NEWS 2 were relatively weak (AUROC 0.62/0.62 and AUROC 0.59/0.60 respectively); for IHCA the performance was poor. There were no differences between NEWS and NEWS 2 as to the predictive power. CONCLUSION: The prognostic accuracy of NEWS 2 to predict mortality within 24 h was acceptable. However, the prognostic accuracy of NEWS 2 to predict IHCA was poor. NEWS and NEWS 2 performed similar in predicting the risk of SAEs but their performances were not sufficient for use as a risk stratification tool in patients assessed by a RRT.
