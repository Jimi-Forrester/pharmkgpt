19930901|a|OBJECTIVE: To assess the medical community's awareness and practice regarding delirium in the intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS: One hundred and ten predesigned questionnaires were distributed to ICU practitioners in the affiliated hospitals of Zhejiang University. RESULTS: A total of 105 valid questionnaires were collected. Totally, 55.3% of the clinicians considered that delirium was common in the ICU. Delirium was believed to be a significant or serious problem by 70.5% of respondents, and under-diagnosis was acknowledged by 56.2% of the respondents. The incidence of ICU delirium is even more under-estimated by the pediatric doctors compared with their counterparts in adult ICU (P less than 0.05). Primary disease of the brain (agreed by 82.1% of the respondents) was believed to be the most common risk factor for delirium. None of the ICU professionals screened delirium or used a specific tool for delirium assessment routinely. The vast majority (92.4%) of respondents had little knowledge on the diagnosis and the standard treatment of delirium. CONCLUSIONS: Although delirium is considered as a serious problem by a majority of the surveyed ICU professionals, it is still under-recognized in routine critical care practice. Data from this survey show a disconnection between the perceived significance of delirium and the current practices of monitoring and treatment in ICU in China.
