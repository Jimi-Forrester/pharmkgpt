26836159|t|JNK: A Putative Link Between Insulin Signaling and VGLUT1 in Alzheimer's Disease.
26836159|a|In the present work, the involvement of JNK in insulin signaling alterations and its role in glutamatergic deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been studied. In postmortem cortical tissues, pJNK levels were increased, while insulin signaling and the expression of VGLUT1 were decreased. A significant correlation was found between reduced expression of insulin receptor and VGLUT1. The administration of a JNK inhibitor reversed the decrease in VGLUT1 expression found in a mice model of insulin resistance. It is suggested that activation of JNK in AD inhibits insulin signaling which could lead to a decreased expression of VGLUT1, therefore contributing to the glutamatergic deficit in AD.
