33125542|a|OBJECTIVE: To perform an updated review of the literature on the neurological manifestations of COVID-19-infected patients METHODS: A PRISMA-guideline-based systematic review was conducted on PubMed, EMBASE, and SCOPUS. Series reporting neurological manifestations of COVID-19 patients were studied. RESULTS: 39 studies and 68,361 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients were included. Up to 21.3% of COVID-19 patients presented neurological symptoms. Headache (5.4%), skeletal muscle injury (5.1%), psychiatric disorders (4.6%), impaired consciousness (2.8%), gustatory/olfactory dysfunction (2.3%), acute cerebrovascular events (1.4%), and dizziness (1.3%), were the most frequently reported neurological manifestations. Ischemic stroke occurred among 1.3% of COVID-19 patients. Other less common neurological manifestations were cranial nerve impairment (0.6%), nerve root and plexus disorders (0.4%), epilepsy (0.7%), and hemorrhagic stroke (0.15%). Impaired consciousness and acute cerebrovascular events were reported in 14% and 4% of patients with a severe disease, respectively, and they were significantly higher compared to non-severe patients (p < 0.05). Individual patient data from 129 COVID-19 patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) were extracted: mean age was 64.4 (SD +- 6.2), 78.5% had anterior circulation occlusions, the mean NIHSS was 15 (SD +- 7), and the intra-hospital mortality rate was 22.8%. Admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) was required among 63% of patients. CONCLUSION: This updated review of literature, shows that headache, skeletal muscle injury, psychiatric disorders, impaired consciousness, and gustatory/olfactory dysfunction were the most common neurological symptoms of COVID-19 patients. Impaired consciousness and acute cerebrovascular events were significantly higher among patients with a severe infection. AIS patients required ICU admission in 63% of cases, while intra-hospital mortality rate was close to 23%.
