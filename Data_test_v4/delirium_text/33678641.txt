33678641|a|With the advancement of disease treatments, the number of patients undergoing surgery worldwide is increasing. However, many patients still experience severe perioperative complications. Perioperative hypotension is one of the common side effects during surgery. Physiologically, perioperative hypotension can lead to insufficient perfusion of important organs and result in acute and chronic irreversible organ injury, which cause serious consequences for the patient's postoperative hospitalization and even the long-term outcome. Therefore, in order to optimize perioperative circulation management and improve the quality of life for patients after surgery, it is of great importance to investigate the relationship between perioperative hypotension and postoperative myocardial injury, ischemic stroke, postoperative delirium, acute kidney injury, and postoperative mortality. Individualized circulation management and reasonable application of vasoactive drugs may be the key point to early prevention and correct treatment of perioperative hypotension, which is of great significance for reducing perioperative related morbidity and mortality and improving the prognosis for the surgical patients.
