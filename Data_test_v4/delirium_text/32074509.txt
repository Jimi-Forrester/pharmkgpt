32074509|a|Despite that millions of people suffer from major depressive disorder (MDD), the mechanism underlying MDD remains elusive. Recently, it has been reported that entorhinal cortex (EC) functions on the regulation of depressive-like phenotype relying on the stimulation of glutamatergic afferent from EC to hippocampus. Based on this, we used liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method to explore metabolic alterations in the EC of mice after exposed to chronic restraint stress (CRS). Molecular validation was conducted via the application of western blot and RT-qPCR. Through this study, we found significant upregulation of glutamate, ornithine aspartic acid, 5-hydroxytryptophan, L-tyrosine and norepinephrine in CRS group, accompanied with downregulation of homovanillic acid. Focusing on these altered metabolic pathways in EC, we found that gene levels of GAD1, GLUL and SNAT1 were increased. Upregulation of SERT and EAAT2 in protein expression level were also validated, while no significant changes were found in TH, AADC, MAOA, VMAT2, GAD1, GLUL and SNAT1. Our findings firstly provide evidence about the alteration of metabolites and related molecules in the EC of mice model of depression, implying the potential mechanism in MDD pathology.
