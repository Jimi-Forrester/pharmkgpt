36753315|t|The Health Care Trajectories of Older People in Foster Families: Protocol for an Observational Study.
36753315|a|BACKGROUND: With aging of the population, the search for alternative models of care adapted to older people with dependency is necessary. In this setting, foster families (1-3 older people per family) could be an alternative to nursing homes, residential care facilities, or community- and home-based care. OBJECTIVE: The KArukera Study of Ageing in Foster Families is a prospective cohort study designed to investigate the care pathways of older people with dependency in foster care over a year. The 1-year hospitalization rate (main objective), cost of hospitalization, incidence of mortality, prevalence of geriatric syndromes, and quality of life of residents will be assessed. Quality of life and burnout of their respective foster caregivers will also be studied. METHODS: This study cohort will include 250 older people living in foster families in Guadeloupe (French West Indies), as well as their respective foster caregivers. Both older people and caregivers will be interviewed concurrently on site at three time points: (1) at baseline, (2) at 6 months, and (3) at 12 months. For older people, we will collect anthropometric measures, cognitive impairment, depressive and anxiety symptoms, functional abilities, physical frailty, information on general health status, quality of life, and care pathways (hospitalization, mortality, and medical and paramedical consultations). We will also assess the quality of life and burnout symptoms of family caregivers at each follow-up. A phone update of vital status (alive or death) and care pathways of residents will be carried out at 3 and 9 months after the baseline examination. RESULTS: Recruitment opened in September 2020 and ended in May 2021, with 109 older people recruited and 56 respective foster caregivers. The 1-year follow-up was ended in June 2022. Data analyses are ongoing and the first results are expected to be published in May 2023. CONCLUSIONS: Foster families are a potentially innovative way to accommodate dependent older people. This study could help define the clinical profile of older people adapted to foster families in the transition from frailty to dependency. The effectiveness of foster families, in terms of hospitalizations and mortality, will be compared with other models of care, particularly nursing homes. In this setting, a twin study carried out in nursing homes in Guadeloupe with similar aims and outcomes will be conducted. Beyond mortality and morbidity, the numerous outcomes will allow us to assess the evolution of geriatric syndromes over time.
