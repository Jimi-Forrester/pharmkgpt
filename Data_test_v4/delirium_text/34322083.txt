34322083|t|Multi-Dimensional Diffusion Tensor Imaging Biomarkers for Cognitive Decline From the Preclinical Stage: A Study of Post-stroke Small Vessel Disease.
34322083|a|Objectives: We aim to investigate whether multi-dimensional diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) measures can sensitively identify different cognitive status of cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) and to explore the underlying pattern of white matter disruption in CSVD. Methods: Two hundred and two participants were recruited, composed of 99 CSVD patients with mild cognitive impairment (VaMCI) and 60 with no cognitive impairment (NCI) and 43 healthy subjects as normal controls (NC). Full domain neuropsychological tests and diffusion-weighted imaging were performed on each subject. DTI metrics such as fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), the skeletonized mean diffusivity (PSMD), and structural brain network measures including network strength, global efficiency (EGlobal), and local efficiency (ELocal) were calculated. Region of interest (ROI) analysis of 42 white matter tracts was performed to examine the regional anatomical white matter disruption for each group. Results: Significant differences of multiple cognitive test scores across all cognitive domains especially processing and executive function existed among the three groups. DTI measures (FA, MD, and PSMD) showed significant group difference with the cognitive status changing. FA and EGlobal showed significant correlation with processing speed, executive function, and memory. ROI analysis found that white matter integrity impairment occurred from the preclinical stage of vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) due to CSVD. These lesions in the NCI group mainly involved some longitudinal fibers such as right superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF-R), right superior fronto-occipital fasciculus (SFO-R), and right uncinate fasciculus (UNC-R), which might be more vulnerable to the cerebrovascular aging and disease process. Conclusions: DTI measures are sensitive neuroimaging markers in detecting the early cognitive impairment and able to differentiate the different cognitive status due to CSVD. Subtle changes of some vulnerable white matter tracts may be observed from the preclinical stage of VCI and have a local to general spreading pattern during the disease progression.
