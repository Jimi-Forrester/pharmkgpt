38232903|a|Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is an irreversible and progressive neurological disease that has affected at least 50 million people around the globe. Considering the severity of the disease and the continuous increase in the number of patients, the development of new effective drugs or intervention strategies for AD has become urgent. AD is caused by a combination of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors, but its exact cause has not yet been clarified. Given the current challenges being faced in the clinical treatment of AD, such as complex AD pathological network and insufficient early diagnosis, herein, we have focused on the three core pathological features of AD, including amyloid-beta (Abeta) aggregation, tau phosphorylation and tangles, and activation of inflammatory factors. In this review, we have briefly underscored the primary evidence supporting each pathology and discuss AD pathological network among Abeta, tau, and inflammation. We have also comprehensively summarized the most instructive drugs and their treatment strategies against Abeta, tau, or neuroinflammation used in basic research and clinical trials. Finally, we have discussed and outlined the pros and cons of each pathological approach and looked forward to potential personalized diagnosis and treatment strategies that are beneficial to AD patients.
