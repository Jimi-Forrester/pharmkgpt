19925479|t|TGF-beta1 pathway as a new target for neuroprotection in Alzheimer's disease.
19925479|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects more than 37 million people worldwide. Current drugs for AD are only symptomatic, but do not interfere with the underlying pathogenic mechanisms of the disease. AD is characterized by the presence of ss-amyloid (Abeta) plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and neuronal loss. The identification of the molecular determinants underlying AD pathogenesis is a fundamental step to design new disease-modifying drugs. Recently, a specific impairment of transforming-growth-factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) signaling pathway has been demonstrated in AD brain. The deficiency of TGF-beta1 signaling has been shown to increase both Abeta accumulation and Abeta-induced neurodegeneration in AD models. The loss of function of TGF-ss1 pathway seems also to contribute to tau pathology and neurofibrillary tangle formation. Growing evidence suggests a neuroprotective role for TGF-beta1 against Abeta toxicity both in vitro and in vivo models of AD. Different drugs, such as lithium or group II mGlu receptor agonists are able to increase TGF-beta1 levels in the central nervous system (CNS), and might be considered as new neuroprotective tools against Abeta-induced neurodegeneration. In the present review, we examine the evidence for a neuroprotective role of TGF-beta1 in AD, and discuss the TGF-beta1 signaling pathway as a new pharmacological target for the treatment of AD.
