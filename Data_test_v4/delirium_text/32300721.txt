32300721|a|OBJECTIVES: Despite a rising clinical and research profile, there is limited information about how frailty and sarcopenia are diagnosed and managed in clinical practice. Our objective was to build a picture of current practice by conducting a survey of UK healthcare professionals. METHODS: We surveyed healthcare professionals in NHS organisations, using a series of four questionnaires. These focussed on the diagnosis and management of sarcopenia, and the diagnosis and management of frailty in acute medical units, community settings and surgical units. RESULTS: Response rates ranged from 49/177 (28%) organisations for the sarcopenia questionnaire to 104/177 (59%) for the surgical unit questionnaire. Less than half of responding organisations identified sarcopenia; few made the diagnosis using a recognised algorithm or offered resistance training. The commonest tools used to identify frailty were the Rockwood Clinical Frailty Scale or presence of a frailty syndrome. Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment was offered by the majority of organisations, but this included exercise therapy in less than half of cases, and medication review in only one-third to two-thirds of cases. CONCLUSIONS: Opportunities exist to improve consistency of diagnosis and delivery of evidence-based interventions for both sarcopenia and frailty.
