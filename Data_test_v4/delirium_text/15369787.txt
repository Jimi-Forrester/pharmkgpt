15369787|a|The underlying pathomechanisms in prion infections of the central nervous system are still insufficiently understood. The identification of genes with altered expression patterns in the diseased brain may provide insight into the disease development on the molecular level, which ultimately leads to neuronal loss. To provide a detailed analysis of changes in the molecular level in prion disease pathology we used a large-scale gene array based approach, which covers more than 11,000 functionally characterised sequences and expressed sequence tags, for the analysis of gene expression profile alterations in the cortex, medulla, and pons of scrapie-infected mice. The study identified in total 114 genes with altered mRNA levels, the majority of which were previously not known to be affected by the disease. Overall the gene array data demonstrate the presence of a strong inflammatory reaction and stress response, and show similarities to gene expression patterns found in brains affected by Alzheimer's disease and aging, respectively.
