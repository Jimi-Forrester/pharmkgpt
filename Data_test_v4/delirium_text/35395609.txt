Disruptions to specific attention subdomains might impair a wide range of everyday tasks, including road safety. As there are millions of COVID-19 patients with different socio-economic backgrounds, screening of attentional performance less dependent on education is needed. Here, we verified if physically recovered COVID-19 inpatients showed specific attention decrements at discharge. The Continuous Visual Attention Test (CVAT) is a Go/No-go task which is independent of participants' schooling. It detects visuomotor reaction time (RT = intrinsic alertness), variability of reaction time (VRT = sustained attention), omission (focused-attention), and commission errors (response-inhibition). Thirty physically functional COVID-19 inpatients at discharge and 30 non-infected controls underwent the CVAT. A MANCOVA was performed to examine differences between controls and patients, followed by post-hoc ANCOVAs. Then, we identified the percentile score for each patient within the distribution of the CVAT performance of 211 subjects mentally capable of driving (reference group). COVID-19 patients at discharge showed greater RT and VRT, and more omission errors than controls. Twenty-two patients (73%) had performance below the 5th percentile of the reference group in one or more subdomains. As slow visuomotor RT, deficits in focusing and difficulties in keeping visual attention are associated with traffic accidents, we concluded that most COVID-19 patients at discharge had deficits that may increase the risk of road injuries. As these deficits will probably affect other daily activities, a routine assessment with the CVAT could provide useful information on whom to send to post-COVID centers.
