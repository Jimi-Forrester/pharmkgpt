36622880|a|AIM: To prepare polymer-drug conjugates containing a combination of memantine, tacrine, and E)-N-(3-aminopropyl)cinnamide, promising therapeutics for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders. METHODS: The conjugates were characterised by 1HNMR, particle size analysis, SEM, LC-MS, TEM/EDX, and XRD, followed by in vitro anti-acetylcholinesterase and drug release studies. RESULTS: 1H NMR analysis revealed successful drug conjugation with drug mass percentages in the range of 1.3-6.0% w/w. The drug release from the conjugates was sustained for 10 h in the range of 20-36%. The conjugates' capability to inhibit acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity was significant with IC50 values in the range of 13-44.4 microm which was more effective than tacrine (IC50 =1698.8 microm). The docking studies further confirmed that the conjugation of the drugs into the polymer improved their anti-acetylcholinesterase activity. CONCLUSION: The drug release profile, particle sizes, and in vitro studies revealed that the conjugates are promising therapeutics for treating neurodegenerative disorders.
