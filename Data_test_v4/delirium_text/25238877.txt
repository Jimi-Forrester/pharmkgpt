25238877|a|BACKGROUND: We sought to determine the early and long-term results of in-situ bilateral internal mammary artery (BIMA) grafting in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG). METHODS: Between 1992 and 2011, 16,364 patients underwent primary isolated CABG involving at least one in-situ IMA at our institution. Among these, 1,977 patients underwent in-situ BIMA grafting: the right IMA was used to revascularize the right coronary artery system in 1,279, the circumflex system in 454 patients, and the left anterior descending (LAD) in 244. Logistic and Cox regression analyses were used to predict in-hospital mortality and cumulative late death. RESULTS: Late survival among BIMA patients was negatively and independently influenced by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (hazard ratio (HR) 2.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.6-3.4, p = 0.0005), age (HR 1.2, 95% CI 1.1-1.3, p < 0.001), and mediastinitis (HR 2.1, 95% CI 1.1-4.2, p < 0.03). Gender, body mass index, diabetes, choice of target for the second (non-LAD) IMA, and conduit grafted to the LAD (RIMA vs. LIMA) did not influence late survival among BIMA patients. A BIMA grafting strategy was significantly beneficial for younger patients. However, it was not associated with superior late survival for patients aged 66 years and above at the time of CABG, and showed a trend to harm among octogenarians (HR 1.05, 95% CI 0.70-1.56, p = 0.80). CONCLUSIONS: Female gender, non-insulin dependent diabetes, and the site of second IMA anastomosis did not influence early and long-term outcomes in patients undergoing CABG with in-situ BIMA grafting. The right and left IMAs are equally effective conduits for the LAD. However, advanced age, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and insulin-treated diabetes mellitus have a negative impact on late survival among patients with BIMA grafts.
