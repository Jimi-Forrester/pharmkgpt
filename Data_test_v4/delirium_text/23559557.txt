23559557|t|Palliative care for dementia--time to think again?
23559557|a|It is estimated that there are 35.6 million people with dementia worldwide and this is projected to increase to over 115 million by the year 2050. Dementia is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that significantly reduces survival. End-of-life care received by this group is often poor and does not equate to that offered in other life limiting illnesses. This review highlights results from a large UK study of informal carers of people with dementia to explore what are determinants of care for people with dementia and their family carers. New perspectives as to models of care for end-of-life care for patients with dementia are discussed together with how these may be implemented and delivered within wider community settings and contexts, where many people with dementia may be cared for in the future.
