33098368|t|Delirium, functional decline and quality of life after transcatheter aortic valve implantation: An explorative study.
33098368|a|AIM: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has become an important treatment option for older patients with severe aortic stenosis. However, not all patients benefit from this procedure in terms of functional outcome and quality of life. This complicates patient selection and shared decision-making. Postoperative delirium might negatively affect patient outcomes after TAVI. We therefore studied the potential relationship between postoperative delirium and functional outcome, and how this impacts quality of life after TAVI. METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study of 91 consecutive patients undergoing TAVI between 2015 and 2017 at an academic medical center. All patients underwent a Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment before TAVI. Delirium symptoms were assessed daily during hospitalization. Follow up was carried out between 6 and 12 months postprocedure. The primary outcome was functional decline or death at follow up. Secondarily, we measured quality of life at follow up. RESULTS: The incidence of postoperative delirium was 15.4%. In total, 38.5% of patients experienced functional decline, and 11.0% died during a median follow-up period of 7 months. Delirium resulted in a fourfold increased odds of the combined outcome of functional decline or death. Quality of life was lower in patients that experienced this outcome. CONCLUSION: In a cohort of TAVI patients, functional decline or death was a frequent outcome in the first year postprocedure. Postoperative delirium increased the odds for this outcome substantially. This suggests that delirium risk should be an important factor to consider in shared decision-making for TAVI patients. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2020; 20: 1202-1207.
