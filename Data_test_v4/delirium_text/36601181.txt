36601181|t|Peripheral Neuropathy in Beta-Thalassemia: Corneal Confocal Microscopy-Based Study.
36601181|a|Background Peripheral neuropathy is a controversial but serious complication of beta-thalassemia (beta-Th). Although few studies have reported no relationship between neuropathy and thalassemia, many have linked it with increasing age, iron overload, and iron chelator toxicity. This study aims to investigate the presence of neuropathy in beta-Th using corneal nerve fibers. Methodology A cross-sectional study was conducted using corneal confocal microscopy on individuals with intermediate and major beta-Th who were compared to healthy individuals. The main outcome variables were corneal main nerve and branch nerve densities which were calculated using Image J software. The comparison between groups was done using the independent-samples F-test and Bonferroni post-hoc analysis. Results There was reduced corneal main nerve and branch nerve density in beta-Th intermediate and major patients compared to the control group, and the results were statistically significant (p-value <0.05). However, a significant correlation was not observed between serum ferritin levels and corneal nerve parameters. Conclusions The reduction in corneal nerve parameters in beta-Th patients compared to healthy controls can be an indication of peripheral neuropathy in beta-Th. Further work is needed to confirm these findings.
