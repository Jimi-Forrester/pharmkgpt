38166670|t|Incidence of urinary incontinence after hip fracture surgery and associated risk factors: a prospective study.
38166670|a|BACKGROUND: The contribution of the postoperative process to developing or worsening urinary incontinence (UI) after hip fracture surgery (HFS) remains unclear. We aimed to evaluate UI incidence and worsening among older patients undergoing HFS, and explore associated risk factors. METHODS: This prospective cohort study included patients >= 75 years admitted between October 2019 and October 2021 to the Traumatology Service of three hospitals in the Consorci Sanitari de Alt-Penedes i Garraf (Barcelona, Spain) with hip fracture requiring surgical treatment. UI was assessed using the first two questions of the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire - Short Form (ICIQ-SF) at baseline and at days 30 (+- 3 days) and 90 (+- 3 days) after HFS. Surgery-related data and post-surgical complications were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 248 patients with a mean (SD) age of 85.8 (6.78) years were included; 77.8% were female and 154 (62.1%) had UI at baseline. After HFS, 3.24% experienced urinary tract infections (UTIs), 3.64%, acute urinary retention (AUR), 8.57%, constipation, and 53.9%, prolonged catheterization (> 24 h). Fifty-eight patients without baseline UI developed UI at 30 days, resulting in a UI incidence of 61.7% (95% CI 51.1-71.54) between days 0 and 30. Of the 248 patients, 146 (59.1%) experienced worsening of UI. AUR and UTIs were identified as risk factors for UI development and worsening after HFS, respectively. CONCLUSION: The incidence of UI in older patients after HFS is significant. Patient management protocols should consider AUR and UTIs to reduce or eliminate the incidence of UI in older patients undergoing HFS.
