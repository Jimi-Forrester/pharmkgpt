36573102|t|Updated Perspectives on the Management of Drug-Induced Parkinsonism (DIP): Insights from the Clinic.
36573102|a|Parkinsonism refers to the clinical combination of bradykinesia, rigidity, tremor, and postural instability. Parkinsonism is often neurodegenerative, but it can be secondary or iatrogenic, as in drug-induced parkinsonism (DIP), which is the topic of this review. We review the pathophysiology of DIP, differentiate DIP and idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD), list culprit medications in the development of DIP, discuss the diagnosis of DIP as well as the motor and nonmotor signs and symptoms that can help with differentiation of DIP and PD, and detail the management of DIP.
