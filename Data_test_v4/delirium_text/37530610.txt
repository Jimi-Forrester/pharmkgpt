37530610|t|Cholinesterase Inhibitors for Delusions and Hallucinations in Alzheimer Disease and Parkinson Disease: Questionably Significant Benefits.
37530610|a|Delusions and hallucinations are common in Alzheimer disease (AD) and Parkinson disease (PD), especially in the later stages of illness. Antipsychotic drugs are effective in treating these psychotic symptoms but are associated with an increased risk of serious adverse events, including mortality. There is therefore a need to explore other treatment approaches. In this context, a recent individual patient data meta-analysis of 17 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conducted in AD (12 RCTs) and PD (5 RCTs) found that the cholinesterase inhibitor (ChEI) drugs donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine attenuated the severity of both delusions and hallucinations in both AD and PD. Most of these trials were 24 weeks in duration. The effect sizes, expressed as standardized mean differences (SMDs), were, however, small, lying in the -0.08 to -0.14 range. These values are so small as to be perhaps clinically insignificant. When analyses were restricted to data from patients who actually had delusions and hallucinations at baseline, all effect sizes became larger, lying in the -0.13 to -0.39 range; however, after correcting for multiple hypothesis testing, only the finding for delusions in PD remained statistically significant. The meta-analysis did not provide information on what the best doses were, how long it took for improvement to become evident, and what proportion of patients showed remission from psychotic symptoms. Whereas the signal identified in this meta-analysis merits examination in appropriately designed RCTs, the findings of the meta-analysis may not much change current treatment strategies because patients with dementia would probably anyway receive a ChEI. Therefore, if psychotic symptoms persist for 24 weeks despite optimally dosed ChEI treatment, and if behavioral and psychosocial interventions do not help, clinicians may need to consider the potential benefits vs risks of other drugs, such as atypical antipsychotics and pimavanserin, in a shared decision-making process.
