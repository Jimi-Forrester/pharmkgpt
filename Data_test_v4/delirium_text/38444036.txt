38444036|a|Accurate differential diagnosis among various dementias is crucial for effective treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The study began with searching for novel blood-based neuronal extracellular vesicles (EVs) that are more enriched in the brain regions vulnerable to AD development and progression. With extensive proteomic profiling, GABRD and GPR162 were identified as novel brain regionally enriched plasma EVs markers. The performance of GABRD and GPR162, along with the AD molecule pTau217, was tested using the self-developed and optimized nanoflow cytometry-based technology, which not only detected the positive ratio of EVs but also concurrently presented the corresponding particle size of the EVs, in discovery (n = 310) and validation (n = 213) cohorts. Plasma GABRD+- or GPR162+-carrying pTau217-EVs were significantly reduced in AD compared with healthy control (HC). Additionally, the size distribution of GABRD+- and GPR162+-carrying pTau217-EVs were significantly different between AD and non-AD dementia (NAD). An integrative model, combining age, the number and corresponding size of the distribution of GABRD+- or GPR162+-carrying pTau217-EVs, accurately and sensitively discriminated AD from HC [discovery cohort, area under the curve (AUC) = 0.96; validation cohort, AUC = 0.93] and effectively differentiated AD from NAD (discovery cohort, AUC = 0.91; validation cohort, AUC = 0.90). This study showed that brain regionally enriched neuronal EVs carrying pTau217 in plasma may serve as a robust diagnostic and differential diagnostic tool in both clinical practice and trials for AD.
