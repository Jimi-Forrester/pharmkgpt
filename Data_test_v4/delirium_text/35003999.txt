35003999|t|Barriers and Facilitators in Rehabilitation in Chronic Diseases and After Surgery: Is It a Matter of Adherence?
35003999|a|Although it has been generally acknowledged that participating in rehabilitation programs is better for chronic diseases or post-surgery, the adherence rates of these programs remain lower than expected. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), adherence has been defined as follows: "the extent to which a person's behavior corresponds with agreed recommendations from a healthcare provider." In general, rehabilitation is well investigated, and in chronic diseases like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cardiovascular disease, neuromuscular disease, cancer, and even psychiatric diseases like depression, it has been shown that exercise therapy, in particular, has beneficial effects on morbidity, mortality, and convalescence of these patients. The aim of this review is to give an overview of the barriers and facilitators in rehabilitation practices and possible reasons why adherence rates remain low. Regarding potential future research, barriers and facilitators also need to be taken into account. Despite promising research in the field of preoperative exercise therapy (PET) and preoperative rehabilitation (prehab) and the enormous body of evidence in postoperative rehabilitation or rehabilitation in chronic diseases, it is also needed to take into account the accessibility of these prehab facilities in research and in clinical practice.
