32030485|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are the most common chronic neurodegenerative disorders, characterized by motoric dysfunction or cognitive decline in the early stage, respectively, but often by both symptoms in the advanced stage. Among underlying molecular pathologies that PD and AD patients have in common, more attention is recently paid to the central metabolic dysfunction presented as insulin resistant brain state (IRBS) and altered cerebral glucose metabolism, both also explored in animal models of these diseases. This review aims to compare IRBS and alterations in cerebral glucose metabolism in representative non-transgenic animal PD and AD models. The comparison is based on the selectivity of the neurotoxins which cause experimental PD and AD, towards the cellular membrane and intracellular molecular targets as well as towards the selective neurons/non-neuronal cells, and the particular brain regions. Mitochondrial damage and co-expression of insulin receptors, glucose transporter-2 and dopamine transporter on the membrane of particular neurons as well as astrocytes seem to be the key points which are further discussed in a context of alterations in insulin signalling in the brain and its interaction with dopaminergic transmission, particularly regarding the time frame of the experimental AD/PD pathology appearance and the correlation with cognitive and motor symptoms. Such a perspective provides evidence on IRBS being a common underlying metabolic pathology and a contributor to neurodegenerative processes in representative non-transgenic animal PD and AD models, instead of being a direct cause of a particular neurodegenerative disorder.
