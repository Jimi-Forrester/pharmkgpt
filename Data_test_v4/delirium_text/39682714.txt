39682714|a|Enhancement of neuronal plasticity by small-molecule therapeutics protects cognitive skills and also ameliorates progressive neurodegenerative pathologies like Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia. One such compound, a novel histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) inhibitor named JRM-28, was shown here to enhance dendritic strength, augment spine density, and upregulate post-synaptic neurotransmission in hippocampal neurons. The molecular basis for this effect correlates with JRM-28-induced upregulation of the transcription of cAMP response element-binding protein(CREB), induction of its transcriptional activity, and subsequent stimulation of expressions of CREB-dependent plasticity-associated genes, such as those encoding N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunit NR2A and the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor subunit GluR1. Specifically, JRM-28 stimulated the NMDA- and AMPA-receptor-sensitive ionotropic calcium influx in hippocampal neurons. Interestingly, JRM-28 did not induce NMDA- and AMPA-sensitive calcium influx in hippocampal neurons once the expression of CREB was knocked down by creb siRNA, suggesting the critical role of CREB in JRM-28-mediated upregulation of synaptic plasticity. Finally, JRM-28 upregulated CREB mRNA, CREB-dependent plasticity-associated markers, and ionotropic calcium influx in iPSC-derived AD human neurons, indicating its therapeutic implications in the amelioration of AD pathologies.
