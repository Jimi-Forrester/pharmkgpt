32111138|t|Alzheimer's Disease: From Amyloid to Autoimmune Hypothesis.
32111138|a|Although Alzheimer's disease (AD) was described over a century ago, there are no effective approaches to its prevention and treatment. Such a slow progress is explained, at least in part, by our incomplete understanding of the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of AD. Here, I champion a hypothesis whereby AD is initiated on a disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) caused by either genetic or non-genetic risk factors. The BBB disruption leads to an autoimmune response against pyramidal neurons located in the allo- and neocortical structures involved in memory formation and storage. The response caused by the adaptive immune system is not strong enough to directly kill neurons but may be sufficient to make them selectively vulnerable to neurofibrillary pathology. This hypothesis is based on the recent data showing that memory formation is associated with epigenetic chromatin modifications and, therefore, may be accompanied by expression of memory-specific proteins recognized by the immune system as "non-self" antigens. The autoimmune hypothesis is testable, and I discuss potential ways for its experimental and clinical verification. If confirmed, this hypothesis can radically change therapeutic approaches to AD prevention and treatment.
