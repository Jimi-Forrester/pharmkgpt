37904369|a|HIV-related neurocognitive disorders (HAND) have emerged as a significant concern in the context of HIV infection. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the diagnosis, treatment, and mental health implications associated with HAND. Diagnosis of HAND involves a multifaceted approach, combining clinical assessments, neurocognitive testing, and neuroimaging techniques. Various screening tools and standardized assessments have been developed to aid in the early detection and monitoring of HAND. Timely diagnosis allows for appropriate interventions and personalized treatment strategies. Treatment for HAND encompasses a multidisciplinary approach targeting different aspects of cognitive impairment. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) remains the cornerstone of treatment, effectively reducing viral load and preventing further neurocognitive decline. Adjunctive therapies, including cognitive rehabilitation, pharmacological interventions, and psychosocial support, play crucial roles in managing cognitive symptoms and enhancing overall quality of life. Mental health implications associated with HAND are profound and require special attention. Individuals with HAND are at higher risk of experiencing psychological distress, depression, anxiety, and reduced social functioning. Integrated care models that address physical and mental health aspects are vital in optimizing treatment outcomes and promoting mental well-being in this population. Furthermore, this paper highlights the need for ongoing research to unravel the underlying mechanisms of HAND and develop targeted interventions. Identifying risk factors, understanding the impact of HIV on the brain, and exploring novel treatment modalities are essential areas of focus. Additionally, living with HAND social and cultural aspects must be considered to ensure equitable access to care and support for all affected individuals.
