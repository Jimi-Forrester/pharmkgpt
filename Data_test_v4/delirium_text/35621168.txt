35621168|t|Cholinergic models of memory impairment in animals and man: scopolamine vs. biperiden.
35621168|a|Scopolamine has been used as a pharmacologic model for cognitive impairments in dementia and Alzheimer's disease. The validity of this model seems to be limited because findings in animals do not readily translate to novel treatments in humans. Biperiden is also a cholinergic deficit model for cognitive impairments but specifically blocks muscarinic M1 receptors. The effects of scopolamine and biperiden (and pirenzepine) are compared in animal studies and related to findings in humans. It is concluded that the effects on cognitive functions are different for scopolamine and biperiden, and they should be considered as different cognitive deficit models. Scopolamine may model more advanced stages of Alzheimer's disease whereas biperiden may model the early deficits in declarative memory in aging and mild cognitive impairment.
