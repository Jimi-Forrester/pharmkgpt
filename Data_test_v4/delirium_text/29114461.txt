29114461|a|The search for biomarkers in cognition has been the focus of a large part of the research on patients suffering from schizophrenia. The scientific literature is heterogeneous, and few studies establishing an integrative model of pathogenesis and therapeutic response are available in this field. In this review, we aimed to summarize three essential aspects correlated with cognitive performance: 1) the relationship between inflammation and cognition in schizophrenia, 2) the role of prolactin in cognition, and 3) the association between cognition and neurotrophic factors, particularly brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Several studies support the association of inflammatory markers with cognitive status in schizophrenia. In recent decades, the development of effective therapies for cognitive impairment in schizophrenia has focused on the search for anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory medications. Conversely, the implications of prolactin and its functions in cognition, the transition to psychosis and the diagnosis and prognosis of schizophrenia have been established independent of antipsychotic treatment. With regard to neurotrophic factors, a recent study has correlated BDNF levels with cognitive recovery in schizophrenic patients treated with cognitive remediation. We conclude that although there is a diversity of biomarkers focused on cognitive function in schizophrenia, BDNF is the biomarker that has accumulated the vast majority of evidence in the current literature.
