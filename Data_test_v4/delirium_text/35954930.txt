35954930|t|The Relationship between Mental Disorders and the COVID-19 Pandemic-Course, Risk Factors, and Potential Consequences.
35954930|a|In this review the authors discuss that COVID-19 has already had a direct impact on the physical health of many people and that it appears to have put at risk the mental health of large populations. In this review, we also discuss the relationship between mental disorders and the SARS-CoV-2 infection. We convey the disorders' risk factors and the more serious mental disorder consequences of COVID-19. People with mental health disorders could be more susceptible to the emotional responses brought on by the COVID-19 epidemic. The COVID-19 pandemic may adversely influence the mental health of patients with already diagnosed mental disorders. For the aim of dealing better with the psychological problems of people afflicted by the COVID-19 pandemic, new psychological procedures are required.
