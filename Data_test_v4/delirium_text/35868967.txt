35868967|t|Elucidating the binding and inhibitory potential of p-coumaric acid against amyloid fibrillation and their cytotoxicity: Biophysical and docking analysis.
35868967|a|P-Coumaric acid (p-CA) is a plant metabolite with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. Due to its therapeutic potential, p-CA has attracted much attention from the scientific community lately. Oxidative stress, amyloid formation, and impaired proteasomal degradation are hallmarks of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's (AD) and are targets for developing therapeutics against such conditions. Here, we have investigated the anti-amyloidogenic properties of p-coumaric acid on hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL). Heat, pH, and agitation (55  C, pH 2.0, 600 rpm) stress were used to induce amyloid formation in lysozyme. The aggregates characterization was done by turbidity, Rayleigh light scattering (RLS), and thioflavin-T (ThT) assays. Moreover, ANS (1-anilino naphthalene sulphate) binding assay and circular dichroism (CD) were employed to unveil protein hydrophobicity and secondary structure perturbation, respectively. Lysozyme demonstrated increased hydrophobicity and transition of alpha-helix to beta-sheet under aggregating conditions. Moreover, co-incubation of lysozyme with p-coumaric acid attenuates the process of amyloid in a concentration dependent manner. At 50 and 200 muM concentrations of p-coumaric acid, lysozyme retained its native-like folded structure. Cytotoxicity protection on human SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cell line was also observed using MTT assay and phase contrast microscopy. In addition, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) reaffirms the fibrillar nature of lysozyme aggregates and their attenuation by p-coumaric acid. The steady state fluorescence revealed that the mode of fluorescence quenching for the HEWL-p-coumaric acid interaction is static rather than dynamic. Moderate strength of binding in order of 104 M-1 exists between HEWL and p-coumaric acid. Thermodynamic parameters ( H and  S) obtained from van't Hoff plot suggested spontaneous reaction with hydrophobic interaction. A slight micro-environmental change in HEWL around Tyr residue was observed during the binding process with the help of synchronous fluorescence. Molecular docking analysis reported the involvement of amino acid residues (TRP63, LEU75, ASP101, LYS97) to form a complex between HEWL-p-coumaric acid. The observed anti-amyloidogenic and inherent antioxidative properties of p-coumaric acid could be helpful to design a neuroprotective agent.
