37606179|t|Cycle exercise training and muscle mass: A preliminary investigation of 17 lower limb muscles in older men.
37606179|a|Cycling exercise in older individuals is beneficial for the cardiovascular system and quadriceps muscles, including partially reversing the age-related loss of quadriceps muscle mass. However, the effect of cycling exercise on the numerous other lower limb muscles is unknown. Six older men (74 +- 8 years) underwent MRI before and after 12-weeks of progressive aerobic cycle exercise training (3-4 days/week, 60-180 min/week, 60%-80% heart rate reserve, VO2 max: +13%) for upper (rectus femoris, vastii, adductor longus, adductor magnus, gracilis, sartorius, biceps femoris long head, biceps femoris short head, semimembranosus, semitendinosus) and lower (anterior tibial, posterior tibialis, peroneals, flexor digitorum longus, lateral gastrocnemius, medial gastrocnemius, soleus) leg muscle volumes. In the upper leg, cycle exercise training induced hypertrophy (p <= 0.05) in the vastii (+7%) and sartorius (+6%), with a trend to increase biceps femoris short head (+5%, p = 0.1). Additionally, there was a trend to decrease muscle volume in the adductor longus (-6%, p = 0.1) and biceps femoris long head (-5%, p = 0.09). In the lower leg, all 7 muscle volumes assessed were unaltered pre- to post-training (-2% to -3%, p > 0.05). This new evidence related to cycle exercise training in older individuals clarifies the specific upper leg muscles that are highly impacted, while revealing all the lower leg muscles do not appear responsive, in the context of muscle mass and sarcopenia. This study provides information for exercise program development in older individuals, suggesting other specific exercises are needed for the rectus femoris and adductors, certain hamstrings, and the anterior and posterior lower leg muscles to augment the beneficial effects of cycling exercise for older adults.
