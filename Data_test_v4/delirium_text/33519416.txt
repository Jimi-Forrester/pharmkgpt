33519416|a|Recent research on Parkinson's disease (PD) has demonstrated the topological abnormalities of structural covariance networks (SCNs) using various morphometric features from structural magnetic resonance images (sMRI). However, the sulcal depth (SD)-based SCNs have not been investigated. In this study, we used SD to investigate the topological alterations of SCNs in 60 PD patients and 56 age- and gender-matched healthy controls (HC). SCNs were constructed by thresholding SD correlation matrices of 68 regions and analyzed using graph theoretical approaches. Compared with HC, PD patients showed increased normalized clustering coefficient and normalized path length, as well as a reorganization of degree-based and betweenness-based hubs (i.e., less frontal hubs). Moreover, the degree distribution analysis showed more high-degree nodes in PD patients. In addition, we also found the increased assortativity and reduced robustness under a random attack in PD patients compared to HC. Taken together, these findings indicated an abnormal topological organization of SD-based SCNs in PD patients, which may contribute in understanding the pathophysiology of PD at the network level.
