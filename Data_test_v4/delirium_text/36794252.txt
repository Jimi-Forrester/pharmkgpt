36794252|a|Oxidative stress and dysregulated inflammatory responses are the hallmarks of inflammatory disorders, which are key contributors to high mortality rates and impose a substantial economic burden on society. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are vital signaling molecules that promote the development of inflammatory disorders. The existing mainstream therapeutic approaches, including steroid and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and proinflammatory cytokine inhibitors with anti-leucocyte inhibitors, are not efficient at curing the adverse effects of severe inflammation. Moreover, they have serious side effects. Metallic nanozymes (MNZs) mimic the endogenous enzymatic process and are promising candidates for the treatment of ROS-associated inflammatory disorders. Owing to the existing level of development of these metallic nanozymes, they are efficient at scavenging excess ROS and can resolve the drawbacks of traditional therapies. This review summarizes the context of ROS during inflammation and provides an overview of recent advances in metallic nanozymes as therapeutic agents. Furthermore, the challenges associated with MNZs and an outline for future to promote the clinical translation of MNZs are discussed. Our review of this expanding multidisciplinary field will benefit the current research and clinical application of metallic-nanozyme-based ROS scavenging in inflammatory disease treatment.
