18662007|t|Grapes and human health: a perspective.
18662007|a|Grapes are a valuable source of numerous phytonutrients, including the intensively studied constituent, resveratrol. A question worth addressing is the potential of dietary grape consumption to positively modulate human health. Many studies have suggested cardiovascular benefits, and some work has indicated cancer chemopreventive activity. Data are particularly compelling in the area of skin cancer prevention. With financial support provided by the California Table Grape Commission, novel and exciting preliminary data are emerging from independent research suggesting beneficial activity against other less prevalent but devastating illnesses, such as Alzheimer's disease and urinary bladder dysfunction. It is further suggested that some of the copious amounts of data obtained with resveratrol may be relevant to grape consumption, especially responses that can be mediated by low concentrations of the substance. Whether future specific health claims will be sought from or allowed by regulatory authorities is not known, but based on existing data, it is clear that grapes should be considered an integral component of fruit and vegetable enriched diets that are recommended by health authorities and widely accepted as beneficial for human health and disease prevention.
