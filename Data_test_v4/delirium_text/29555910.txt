29555910|a|Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying Alzheimer's disease (AD) is necessary for the diagnosis and treatment of this neurodegenerative disorder. It is therefore important to detect the most important genes and miRNAs, which are associated with molecular events, and studying their interactions for recognition of AD mechanisms. Here we focus on the genes and miRNAs expression profile, which we have detected the miRNA target genes involved in AD. These are the most quintessential to find the most important miRNA, to target genes and their important pathways. A total of 179 differentially expressed miRNAs (DEmiRs) and 1404 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were obtained from a comprehensive meta-analysis. Also, regions specific genes with their molecular function in AD have been demonstrated. We then focused on miRNAs which regulated most genes in AD, alongside we analyzed their pathways. The miRNA-30a-5p and miRNA-335 elicited a major function in AD after analyzing the regulatory network, we showed they were the most regulatory miRNAs in the AD. In conclusion, we demonstrated the most important genes, miRNAs, miRNA-mRNA interactions and their related pathways in AD using Bioinformatics methods. Accordingly, our defined genes and miRNAs could be used for future molecular studies in the context of AD.
