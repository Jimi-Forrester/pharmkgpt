38098037|a|BACKGROUND: Elderly residents with physical and cognitive impairments in long-term care facilities are vulnerable to safety risks. PURPOSE: This study investigated factors that influence patient safety cultures in delirium nursing care in long-term care facilities. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 214 nurses working in 12 long-term care facilities using a structured questionnaire from February 15, 2022, to March 14, 2022. Data analysis was performed using Pearson's correlation coefficients and hierarchical analysis with SPSS/WIN 25.0 software. RESULTS: Significant factors associated with patient safety culture were identified. Organizational factors included the availability of delirium care manuals, nursing education and experience in delirium care, and the perceived necessity of delirium education. Individual factors included nurse-to-patient ratios, and nurses marital status. CONCLUSION: To foster a strong patient safety culture, attention should be given to the availability of delirium care resources, the promotion of specialized and ongoing education and experience, and adequate staffing levels.
