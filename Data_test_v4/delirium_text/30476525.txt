30476525|t|Zebrafish models of diabetes-related CNS pathogenesis.
30476525|a|Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a common metabolic disorder that affects multiple organ systems. DM also affects brain processes, contributing to various CNS disorders, including depression, anxiety and Alzheimer's disease. Despite active research in humans, rodent models and in-vitro systems, the pathogenetic link between DM and brain disorders remains poorly understood. Novel translational models and new model organisms are therefore essential to more fully study the impact of DM on CNS. The zebrafish (Danio rerio) is a powerful novel model species to study metabolic and CNS disorders. Here, we discuss how DM alters brain functions and behavior in zebrafish, and summarize their translational relevance to studying DM-related CNS pathogenesis in humans. We recognize the growing utility of zebrafish models in translational DM research, as they continue to improve our understanding of different brain pathologies associated with DM, and may foster the discovery of drugs that prevent or treat these diseases.
