34070628|t|Role of Iron Chelation and Protease Inhibition of Natural Products on COVID-19 Infection.
34070628|a|Although the epidemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 callings for international attention to develop new effective therapeutics, no specific protocol is yet available, leaving patients to rely on general and supportive therapies. A range of respiratory diseases, including pulmonary fibrosis, have been associated with higher iron levels that may promote the course of viral infection. Recent studies have demonstrated that some natural components could act as the first barrier against viral injury by affecting iron metabolism. Moreover, a few recent studies have proposed the combination of protease inhibitors for therapeutic use against SARS-CoV-2 infection, highlighting the role of viral protease in virus infectivity. In this regard, this review focuses on the analysis, through literature and docking studies, of a number of natural products able to counteract SARS-CoV-2 infection, acting both as iron chelators and protease inhibitors.
