35278341|a|INTRODUCTION: Identifying CSF-based biomarkers for the beta-amyloidosis that initiates Alzheimer's disease (AD) could provide inexpensive and dynamic tests to distinguish AD from normal aging and predict future cognitive decline. METHODS: We developed immunoassays specifically detecting all C-terminal variants of secreted amyloid beta-protein and identified a novel biomarker, the Abeta 37/42 ratio, that outperforms the canonical Abeta42/40 ratio as a means to evaluate the gamma-secretase activity and brain Abeta accumulation. RESULTS: We show that Abeta 37/42 can distinguish physiological and pathological status in (1) presenilin-1 mutant vs wild-type cultured cells, (2) AD vs control brain tissue, and (3) AD versus cognitively normal (CN) subjects in CSF, where 37/42 (AUC 0.9622) outperformed 42/40 (AUC 0.8651) in distinguishing CN from AD. DISCUSSION: We conclude that the Abeta 37/42 ratio sensitively detects presenilin/gamma-secretase dysfunction and better distinguishes CN from AD than Abeta42/40 in CSF. Measuring this novel ratio alongside promising phospho-tau analytes may provide highly discriminatory fluid biomarkers for AD.
