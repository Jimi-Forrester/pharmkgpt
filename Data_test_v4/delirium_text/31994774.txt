31994774|a|INTRODUCTION: People with Parkinson disease (PD) may be at increased risk of delirium and associated adverse outcomes. Delirium is an acute neuropsychiatric syndrome defined by confusion and inattention and is common in older adults. Previous studies may have underestimated the prevalence of delirium in PD because of overlapping symptoms, lack of awareness, and poorly defined criteria. We aimed to identify the prevalence and incidence of delirium in inpatients with PD. MEASUREMENTS: Participants were inpatients with PD admitted over a 4-month period. Delirium prevalence was classified using a standardised assessment at a single visit on the basis of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders fifth edition (DSM-5) criteria. To capture remaining time in hospital, incident delirium was diagnosed using detailed clinical vignettes and a validated consensus method. RESULTS: Forty-four PD patients consented to take part in the study, accounting for 53 admissions. Delirium prevalence was 34.0% (n = 18); reviewing participants over the duration of their hospital stay identified 30 (56.6%) incident delirium cases. The admitting team screened 24.5% for delirium, and delirium was documented in eight (14.8%) patients' medical notes. Patients with delirium were significantly older, had higher frailty scores, and had a longer hospital stay (P < .05 for all). CONCLUSIONS: Delirium is common in PD inpatients at admission and incidence increases during hospital stay, but delirium is commonly missed. Our results highlight the importance of screening for delirium throughout patients' stay in hospital. Future studies should consider frequent evaluation over the duration of hospital stay to identify emergent delirium during the admission.
