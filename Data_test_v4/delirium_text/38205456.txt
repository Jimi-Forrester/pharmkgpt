38205456|t|Impact of Quiet Time on Psychological Outcomes of Neonatal Intensive Care Unit Nurses in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia: A Cross-Sectional Study.
38205456|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Although quiet time is implemented in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) for the benefit of infants, it may also positively impact the psychological outcomes of healthcare professionals. Several studies have examined the impact of quiet-time implementation on patients; however, there is a paucity of research assessing its impact on the psychological outcomes of NICU nurses, particularly in Saudi Arabia. OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: This study aimed to assess the impact of quiet time on the psychological outcomes (stress, anxiety, and depression) of NICU nurses in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. A cross-sectional design was used for this study. A total of 87 NICU nurses from two hospitals participated in this study. One group did not practice quiet time, while the second group did. A questionnaire survey assessed participants' demographic characteristics, and their depression, anxiety, and stress were assessed using the depression, anxiety, and stress scale-21 (DASS-21). The data were analyzed for frequency, percentage, mean, and standard deviation (SD). Bivariate analysis, independent t-tests, and one-way analysis of variance were used to test the differences between variables and groups. Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) was used to analyze the relationships between continuous variables and perceived stress, anxiety, and depression. RESULTS: A substantial number of NICU nurses perceived stress, anxiety, and depression; however, there were no significant differences in perceived stress, anxiety, and depression between the nurses who worked in NICUs that applied quiet time and NICUs that did not (P <= 0.05). CONCLUSION: This study found no statistically significant relationship between quiet-time implementation and perceived stress, anxiety, or depression among NICU nurses. Further research with a larger sample size or increased quiet-time implementation may be required.
