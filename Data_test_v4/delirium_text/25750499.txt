25750499|a|A new type of tricyclic azaphenothiazines-1,8-diazaphenothiazines-was obtained in the reaction of 2,3- and 3,4-disubstituted pyridines. The reaction ran as the Smiles rearrangement. The 1,8-diazaphenothiazine system was determined using NOE experiment and 2D NMR spectra (COSY, HSQC, HMBC). 10H-1,8-diazaphenothiazine was transformed into 10-derivatives with alkyl, aminoalkyl, amidoalkyl, sulfonamidoalkyl, and nitrogen half-mustard groups. The compounds were tested for their effects on phytohemagglutinin A-induced proliferative response of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and lipopolysaccharide-induced tumor necrosis factor alpha production by human whole blood cultures. The compounds exhibited differential, dose-dependent inhibitory activities in these tests. All the compounds were low toxic against PBMC. The compounds showing the highest antiproliferative activity strongly inhibited the growth of leukemia L-1210 and colon cancer SW-948 cell lines, similarly as cisplatin, a reference drug.
