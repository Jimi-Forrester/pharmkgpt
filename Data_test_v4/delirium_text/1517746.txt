1517746|a|A 47-year-old man began to suffer from progressive truncal ataxia and mental alterations typical of Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome. He showed confusional state, hallucinations, delirium of jealousy and a serious impairment of recent memory. The symptomatology lasted 13 months, but only in the last weeks was it complicated by myoclonias. Triphasic pseudoperiodic sharp-waves characterized the EEG-recordings only in the final stage. Macroscopic examination of the brain showed marked atrophy of the mammillary bodies and superior vermis. However, the histological features were consistent with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) with focal accentuation of the changes in the latter structures. This case supports the hypothesis that CJD-changes begin focally in the CNS and, subsequently, spread along neuronal pathways, probably via central axons. Only in the final stage does the pathological process involve most parts of the gray matter. A focal accentuation of the CJD process in the cerebello-mammillo-thalamic system caused in this case a Wernicke-Korsakoff-like syndrome.
