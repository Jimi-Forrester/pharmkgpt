39022359|a|Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of amyloid-beta (Abeta) has emerged as a crucial strategy for early diagnosis and monitoring of therapeutic advancements targeting Abeta. In our previous first-in-human study, we identified that [18F]Florbetazine ([18F]92), featuring a diaryl-azine scaffold, exhibits higher cortical uptake in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients compared to healthy controls (HC). Building upon these promising findings, this study aimed to characterize the diagnostic potential of [18F]92 and its dimethylamino-modified tracer [18F]91 and further compare them with the benchmark [11C]PiB in the same cohort of AD patients and age-matched HC subjects. The cortical accumulation of these tracers was evident, with no significant radioactivity retention observed in the cortex of HC subjects, consistent with [11C]PiB images (correlation coefficient of 0.9125 and 0.7883 between [18F]Florbetazine/[18F]91 and [11C]PiB, respectively). Additionally, quantified data revealed higher standardized uptake value ratios (SUVR) (with the cerebellum as the reference region) of [18F]Florbetazine/[18F]91 in AD patients compared to the HC group ([18F]Florbetazine: 1.49 vs 1.16; [18F]91: 1.33 vs 1.20). Notably, [18F]Florbetazine exhibited less nonspecific bindings in myelin-rich regions, compared to the dimethylamino-substituted [18F]91, akin to [11C]PiB. Overall, this study suggests that [18F]Florbetazine displays superior characteristics to [18F]91 in identifying Abeta pathology in AD. Furthermore, the close agreement between the uptakes in nontarget regions for [18F]Florbetazine and [11C]PiB in this head-to-head comparison study underscores its suitability for both clinical and research applications.
