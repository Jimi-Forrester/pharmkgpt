39884484|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Qiangji Decoction (QJD), a Chinese medicine, is widely used in Traditional Chinese Medicine to treat amnesia and Alzheimer's disease (AD), showing significant anti-AD effects. However, the precise mechanisms behind these effects are not well understood and require more research. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study aims to elucidate the mechanisms by which QJD ameliorates neuronal damage, synaptic dysfunction, and mitochondrial impairment in AD through the regulation of ROCK2/Drp1-mediated mitochondrial dynamics. MATERIALS AND METHODS: UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS was used to identify active components in QJD extract. The study used SAMP8 mice for AD modeling and SAMR1 mice as controls. Cognitive function in SAMP8 mice was assessed with the Morris Water Maze after following treatment with QJD and the mitochondrial fission inhibitor Mdivi-1. Nissl and FJB staining evaluated QJD's effect on hippocampal injury. Synaptic integrity was examined with Golgi-Cox staining, transmission electron microscopy, and immunofluorescence. Mitochondrial function in hippocampal neurons was assessed using electron microscopy, JC-1 staining, and reagent kits. Western blot analyzed expression of proteins related to mitochondrial fission (ROCK2, Drp1, Fis1, Mff) and fusion (Mfn1, Mfn2, OPA1). RESULTS: The analysis of QJD extract via UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS led to the identification of 46 active compounds. In SAMP8 mice, administration of QJD resulted in decreased escape latency, increased platform crossings, and extended duration in the target quadrant. Additionally, QJD exhibited neuroprotective effects on the hippocampus of SAMP8 mice, effectively preventing neuronal loss and damage. QJD also facilitated the extension and thickening of dendritic spines, enhanced the ultrastructure of hippocampal synapses, and upregulated synaptic function-related proteins, including PSD95 and SYN1. Furthermore, QJD ameliorated mitochondrial damage, improved mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP content, and reduced ROS expression in hippocampal neurons of SAMP8 mice. These effects were mediated through the downregulation of ROCK2, phosphorylated Drp1 (Ser616), Fis1, and Mff, as well as the upregulation of Mfn1, Mfn2, and OPA1. CONCLUSIONS: QJD may reduce neuronal damage, synaptic dysfunction, and mitochondrial impairment in SAMP8 mice by regulating mitochondrial dynamics through the ROCK2/Drp1 pathway.
