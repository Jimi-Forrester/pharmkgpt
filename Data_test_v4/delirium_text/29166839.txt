29166839|t|The synergistic effect of treatment with triptolide and MK-801 in the rat neuropathic pain model.
29166839|a|Triptolide (T10), an active component of Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F, is reported to have potent anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects. Additionally, MK-801, a noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, can reduce glutamate toxicity and has a significant analgesic effect on chronic pain. In this study, we tested the possible synergistic analgesic ability by intrathecal administration of T10 and MK-801 for the treatment of neuropathic pain. Single T10 (3, 10, or 30 microg/kg), MK-801 (10, 30, or 90 microg/kg), or a combination of them were intrathecally administrated in rats with spinal nerve ligation. We found that single administration of T10 caused a slow-acting but long-term analgesic effect, while single administration of MK-801 caused a fast-acting but short-term effect. Administration of their combination showed obviously synergic analgesia and the 1:3 ratio of T10 to MK-801 reached the peak effect. Furthermore, application of T10 and/or MK-801 significantly inhibited the activation of microglia and astrocyte and phosphorylation of STAT3 and NR2B in the spinal dorsal horn induced by chronic neuropathic pain. Our data suggest that the combination of T10 and MK-801 may be a potentially novel strategy for treatment of neuropathic pain.
