38960665|t|Acaricidal activity of Erigeron acer L. root against Haemaphysalis longicornis and phytochemical profiling by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.
38960665|a|The present study is focused on evaluating acaricidal activity and chemical compositions of Erigeron acer root, which was identified as a promising candidate among fifteen Mongolian plant extracts tested for acaricidal activity. The acaricidal effect was evaluated against Haemaphysalis longicornis, assessed for toxicity to normal human skin fibroblast, and analyzed for its chemical constituents. The acetone extract of E. acer root showed significant activity against H. longicornis, with a lethal concentration (LC50) of 5.31 mg/mL and low toxicity, evidenced by a cytotoxic concentration (CC50) of 267.00 microg/mL. Using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and molecular networking, thirteen natural compounds were identified, including pyrrolidines, alkaloids, fatty acids, and flavonoids, highlighting the efficacy of E. acer root extract as an effective acaricide against H. longicornis and offering insights for developing new tick control solutions.
