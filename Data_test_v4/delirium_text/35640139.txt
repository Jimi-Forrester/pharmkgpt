35640139|a|Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified more than 75 genetic variants associated with Alzheimer's disease (ad). However, how these variants function and impact protein expression in brain regions remain elusive. Large-scale proteomic datasets of ad postmortem brain tissues have become available recently. In this study, we used these datasets to investigate brain region-specific molecular pathways underlying ad pathogenesis and explore their potential drug targets. We applied our new network-based tool, Edge-Weighted Dense Module Search of GWAS (EW_dmGWAS), to integrate ad GWAS statistics of 472 868 individuals with proteomic profiles from two brain regions from two large-scale ad cohorts [parahippocampal gyrus (PHG), sample size n = 190; dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), n = 192]. The resulting network modules were evaluated using a scale-free network index, followed by a cross-region consistency evaluation. Our EW_dmGWAS analyses prioritized 52 top module genes (TMGs) specific in PHG and 58 TMGs in DLPFC, of which four genes (CLU, PICALM, PRRC2A and NDUFS3) overlapped. Those four genes were significantly associated with ad (GWAS gene-level false discovery rate < 0.05). To explore the impact of these genetic components on TMGs, we further examined their differentially co-expressed genes at the proteomic level and compared them with investigational drug targets. We pinpointed three potential drug target genes, APP, SNCA and VCAM1, specifically in PHG. Gene set enrichment analyses of TMGs in PHG and DLPFC revealed region-specific biological processes, tissue-cell type signatures and enriched drug signatures, suggesting potential region-specific drug repurposing targets for ad.
