35062922|a|BACKGROUND: Cerebral palsy (CP) is a spectrum of non-progressive motor disorders caused by brain injury during fetal or postnatal periods. Current diagnosis of CP mainly relies on neuroimaging and motor assessment. Here, we aimed to explore novel biomarkers for early diagnosis of CP. METHODS: Blood plasma from five children with CP and their healthy twin brothers/sisters was analyzed by gene microarray to screen out differentially expressed RNAs. Selected differentially expressed circular RNAs (circRNAs) were further validated using quantitative real-time PCR. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to assess the specificity and sensitivity of hsa_circ_0086354 in discriminating children with CP and healthy controls. RESULTS: 43 up-regulated circRNAs and 2 down-regulated circRNAs were obtained by difference analysis (fold change > 2, p < 0.05), among which five circRNAs related to neuron differentiation and neurogenesis were chosen for further validation. Additional 30 pairs of children with CP and healthy controls were recruited and five selected circRNAs were further detected, showing that hsa_circ_0086354 was significantly down-regulated in CP plasma compared with control, which was highly in accord with microarray analysis. ROC curve analysis showed that the area under curve (AUC) to discriminate children with CP and healthy controls using hsa_circ_0086354 was 0.967, the sensitivity was 0.833 and the specificity was 0.966. Moreover, hsa_circ_0086354 was predicted as a competitive endogenous RNA for miR-181a, and hsa_circ_0086354 expression was negatively correlated to miR-181a expression in children with CP. CONCLUSION: Hsa_circ_0086354 was significantly down-regulated in blood plasma of children with CP, which may be a novel competent biomarker for early diagnosis of CP.
