36755014|t|Pyroptosis and degenerative diseases of the elderly.
36755014|a|Pyroptosis is a recently described mechanism of programmed cell death mediated by proteins of the gasdermin family. Widely recognized signaling cascades include the classical, non-classical, caspase-3-dependent gasdermin E and caspase-8-dependent gasdermin D pathways. Additional pyroptotic pathways have been subsequently reported. With the rising prevalence of advanced age, the role of pyroptosis in the degenerative diseases of the elderly has attracted increased research attention. This article reviews the primary mechanisms of pyroptosis and summarizes progress in the research of degenerative diseases of the elderly such as presbycusis, age-related macular degeneration, Alzheimer's disease, intervertebral disc degeneration, and osteoarthritis.
