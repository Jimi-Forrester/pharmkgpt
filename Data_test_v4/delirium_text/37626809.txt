37626809|a|Heart failure is a risk factor for adverse events such as sudden cardiac arrest, liver and kidney failure and death. The gut microbiota and its metabolites are directly linked to the pathogenesis of heart failure. As emerging studies have increased in the literature on the role of specific gut microbiota metabolites in heart failure development, this review highlights and summarizes the current evidence and underlying mechanisms associated with the pathogenesis of heart failure. We found that gut microbiota-derived metabolites such as short chain fatty acids, bile acids, branched-chain amino acids, tryptophan and indole derivatives as well as trimethylamine-derived metabolite, trimethylamine N-oxide, play critical roles in promoting heart failure through various mechanisms. Mainly, they modulate complex signaling pathways such as nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells, Bcl-2 interacting protein 3, NLR Family Pyrin Domain Containing inflammasome, and Protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase. We have also highlighted the beneficial role of other gut metabolites in heart failure and other cardiovascular and metabolic diseases.
