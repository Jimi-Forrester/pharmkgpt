38707155|t|Vitamin D Deficiency in Patients With Low-Energy Hip Fractures in Accordance With the Mediterranean Paradox.
38707155|a|Introduction Vitamin D deficiency (VDD) is considered one of the leading causes of poor bone quality. It may also be related to severe muscular weakness, especially in the elderly, which leads to frequent falls. Thus, VDD might be associated with fragility fractures of the hip, wrist, and spine in this age category. In this cross-sectional study, our goal was to present vitamin D levels in an elderly Mediterranean population with hip fractures and to assess whether its levels are related to the incidence or prevention of such injuries. Methods Between January and December 2021, 140 patients aged 65 years or older were hospitalized in our department with a fracture involving the hip joint. Serum calcium and vitamin D level control was performed upon admission, as well as recording whether anti-osteoporosis medication had been prescribed. Only patients with low-energy fractures were included, whereas oncologic patients and those with high-energy trauma were excluded. Results Thirty-eight men and 102 women, with a mean age of 83.12 and 84.88 years, respectively, participated in our study. Intertrochanteric fractures were the most common injuries (50.72%). Low vitamin D levels (<30 ng/mL) were observed in 132 patients (94.28%). A bone density scan during the last year had been conducted by only seven patients (5%), whereas in 136 patients (97.14%), no anti-osteoporotic medication was given. Conclusion There is an excessive percentage of aged patients with hip fractures in Greece, demonstrating a significant vitamin D insufficiency despite the high annual frequency of sunny days in this Mediterranean region. Presumably, most of these patients neither perform the routine bone density scan nor do they take any kind of preventive pharmaceutical treatment, which might reveal devaluation of osteoporosis from this age group due to contingent comorbidities.
