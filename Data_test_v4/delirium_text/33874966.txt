33874966|a|BACKGROUND: The inflammatory response plays essential roles in the pathological process and prognosis of Parkinson's disease (PD). This research investigated the predictive value of the neutrophil to high-density lipoprotein ratio (NHR), neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and monocyte to high-density lipoprotein ratio (MHR) for PD. METHODS: Patients with PD (n = 98) were divided into three groups according to disease duration: < 6 years (n = 55), 6-10 years (n = 29) and > 10 years (n = 14). Based on the classification system of Hoehn and Yahr, grades 1 ~ 2.5 were considered early-stage PD (n = 44), and grades 3 ~ 5 were considered advanced-stage PD (n = 54). In addition, healthy subjects (n = 98) matched to the above PD patients in the same period were selected as the control group. Differences in the NHR, NLR, MHR and other indicators among the groups were evaluated. RESULTS: Smoking, drinking, the neutrophil count and the NHR and NLR were remarkably greater and hypertension, index of body mass, the lymphocyte count, and the levels of cholesterol in total, triglycerides, lipoprotein cholesterol with low density and uric acid were sharply lower in the PD group compared with in the control group. Analysis of multifactor logistic regression indicated that the NHR (odds ratio (adjusted OR) = 1.576, 95% CI: 1.053 ~ 2.358, P = 0.027) and NLR (adjusted OR = 1.734, 95% CI: 1.046 ~ 2.876, P = 0.033) were factors of risk for PD, while the MHR was not significantly correlated with PD. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUCs) for the prediction of PD by the NHR and NLR were 0.654 (95% CI: 0.583 ~ 0.721, P = 0.0001) and 0.69 (95% CI: 0.62 ~ 0.754, P < 0.0001), respectively, and the optimal cutoff values were 1.848 x 109/mmol and 2.62 x 109/mmol. Spearman's correlation analysis indicated that the NHR was correlated with the disease duration significantly negatively and that the MHR was positively correlated with disease severity. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, the NHR not only has strong predictive value for PD but is also closely related to disease duration. The NHR may be a better prediction for the long-period clinical results in PD patients than the MHR and NLR.
