23536318|t|Distribution of different isoforms of receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase gamma (Ptprg-RPTP gamma) in adult mouse brain: upregulation during neuroinflammation.
23536318|a|The receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase gamma (Ptprg-RPTPgamma) is a receptor protein widely expressed in many tissues, including the central nervous system (CNS). Several RPTPgamma isoforms are expressed in the brain during development and in adulthood, but their distribution and role are unknown. In this study, we investigated the distribution of some RPTPgamma isoforms in the adult brain using antibodies against the epitopes localized in the C- and in the N-terminal domains of the full length isoform of RPTPgamma. We found a predominant and widespread neuronal positivity throughout the neocortex, hippocampus, striatum and in many nuclei of the brainstem and cerebellum. At least 2 distinct isoforms that can co-exist in various compartments in the same cell are detectable in different neuron types. Immunopositivity for epitopes located in both the N- and C-terminus domains were found in the neuropil of cortical and hippocampal neurons, whereas the N-terminal domain positivity was found in the soma, often without colocalization with its C-terminal counterpart. Among glial cells, some protoplasmic and perivascular astrocytes and the cerebellar Bergmann glia, express RPTPgamma. The astrocytic expression of RPTPgamma and putative processing isoforms of 120 and 80 kDa increases during neuroinflammation, in particular 24 h after LPS treatment. Activated astrocytes were found to be strongly positive for RPTPgamma also in a mice model of Alzheimer's disease. Our results confirm previous findings and enrich the current knowledge of RPTPgamma distribution in the CNS, highlighting a role of RPTPgamma during neuroinflammation processes.
