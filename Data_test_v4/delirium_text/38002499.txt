38002499|t|Detecting Central Auditory Processing Disorders in Awake Mice.
38002499|a|Mice are increasingly used as models of human-acquired neurological or neurodevelopmental conditions, such as autism, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer's disease. All these conditions involve central auditory processing disorders, which have been little investigated despite their potential for providing interesting insights into the mechanisms behind such disorders. Alterations of the auditory steady-state response to 40 Hz click trains are associated with an imbalance between neuronal excitation and inhibition, a mechanism thought to be common to many neurological disorders. Here, we demonstrate the value of presenting click trains at various rates to mice with chronically implanted pins above the inferior colliculus and the auditory cortex for obtaining easy, reliable, and long-lasting access to subcortical and cortical complex auditory processing in awake mice. Using this protocol on a mutant mouse model of autism with a defect of the Shank3 gene, we show that the neural response is impaired at high click rates (above 60 Hz) and that this impairment is visible subcortically-two results that cannot be obtained with classical protocols for cortical EEG recordings in response to stimulation at 40 Hz. These results demonstrate the value and necessity of a more complete investigation of central auditory processing disorders in mouse models of neurological or neurodevelopmental disorders.
