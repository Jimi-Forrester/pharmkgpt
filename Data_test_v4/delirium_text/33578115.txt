33578115|a|Electrochemical biosensors have been adopted into a wide range of applications in the study of biometal-protein interactions in neurodegenerative diseases. Transition metals such as zinc, copper, and iron that are significant to biological functions have been shown to have strong implications in the progressive neural degeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and prion protein diseases. This review presents a summative examination of the progress made in the design, fabrication, and applications of electrochemical biosensors in recent literature at understanding the metal-protein interactions in neurodegenerative diseases. The focus will be drawn on disease-causing biomarkers such as amyloid-beta (Abeta) and tau proteins for AD, alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) for PD, and prion proteins (PrP). Topics such as the use of electrochemical biosensing in monitoring biometal-induced conformational changes, elucidation of complexation motifs, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as well as the influence on downstream biomolecular interactions will be discussed. Major results and important concepts presented in these studies will be summarized in the hope to spark inspiration for the next generation of electrochemical sensors.
