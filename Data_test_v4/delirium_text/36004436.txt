36004436|t|Racial Disparities in Psychiatric Decisional Capacity Consultations.
36004436|a|OBJECTIVE: In this study, the authors examined potential disparities and biases in the placement and outcomes of decisional capacity evaluations across races, controlling for patient characteristics. METHODS: The authors reviewed 181 patient decisional capacity consultations requested for the consultation-liaison psychiatry service at a tertiary care medical center from 2018 to 2019. The racial distribution of patients in these consultations was compared with the racial distribution of hospital inpatient admissions from 2018 to 2019. The authors analyzed patient outcomes by using logistic regression that controlled for race, gender, age, education, primary insurance, type of capacity assessment, and psychiatric diagnosis. RESULTS: Decisional capacity consultations were placed disproportionately for Black (43% of consultations vs. 18% of total admissions) and Hispanic patients (26% of consultations vs. 21% of admissions) compared with White and Asian patients. Among 130 patients with a capacity determination, 95 (53% of total sample) were determined not to have capacity, an outcome that did not differ by race but was more likely to occur among patients diagnosed as having delirium. Sixty-seven patients with no capacity (37% of total sample) experienced a change in treatment, an outcome that was less likely to occur among Hispanic patients in the univariable analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Significant racial disparities were observed during the placement of a decisional capacity consultation. These findings reveal the potential biases introduced with both the initial challenge to a patient's capacity and the subsequent outcomes of the consultation. As such, the balance of risk versus benefit or utility of these consultations in certain populations must be carefully considered.
