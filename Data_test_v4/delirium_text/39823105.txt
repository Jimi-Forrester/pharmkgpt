39823105|a|BACKGROUND: Autologous fat injection in facial reconstruction is a common cosmetic surgery. Although cerebral fat embolism (CFE) as a complication is rare, it carries serious health risks. CASE SUMMARY: We present a case of a 29-year-old female patient who developed acute CFE following facial fat filling surgery. After the surgery, the patient experienced symptoms including headache, nausea, vomiting, and difficulty breathing, which was followed by neurological symptoms such as slurred speech and left-sided weakness. Comprehensive physical examination and auxiliary investigations, including blood tests, head and neck computed tomography angiography, and cranial magnetic resonance diffusion-weighted imaging, were performed upon admission. The clinical diagnosis was acute cerebral embolism following facial fat filling surgery. Treatment included measures to improve cerebral circulation, dehydration for intracranial pressure reduction, nutritional support, and rehabilitation therapy for left limb function. The patient showed a significant improvement in symptoms after 2 weeks of treatment. She recovered left limb muscle strength to grade 5, had clear speech, and experienced complete relief of headache. CONCLUSION: Our case highlights the potential occurrence of severe complications in patients undergoing fat injection in facial reconstruction. To prevent these complications, plastic surgeons should enhance their professional knowledge and skills.
