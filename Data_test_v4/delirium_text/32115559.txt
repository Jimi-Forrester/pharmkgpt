32115559|t|[Brain and Neuronal Aging: Aged Brain Controls via Gene Expression Fidelity and Master Regulatory Factors].
32115559|a|Providing plausible strategies for brain aging protection should be a critical concern for countries with large elderly populations including Japan. Age-related cognitive impairments and movement disorders, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, are caused by neurodegeneration that primarily initiates in the hippocampus and the midbrain substantia nigra, respectively. Neurons are postmitotic, and therefore, the accuracy of cellular metabolism should be crucial for maintaining neural functions throughout their life. Thus accuracy of protein synthesis is a critical concern in discussing mechanisms of aging. The essence of the so-called "error catastrophe theory" of aging was on the fidelity of ribosomal translation and/or aminoacylation of tRNA. There is evidence that reduced protein synthesis accuracy results in neurodegeneration. Similarly, reduced proteostasis via autophagy and proteasomes in aging is crucial for protein quality control and well documented as a risk for aging. In both neurodegeneration and protein quality controls, various proteins are involved in their regulation, but recent evidence suggests that repressor element-1 silencing transcription factor (REST) could be a master regulatory protein that is crucial for orchestrating the neural protecting events in human brain aging. REST is induced in the aged brain, and protects neurons against oxidative stress and protein toxicity. Interestingly, REST is identical with neuron-restrictive silencer factor (NRSF), the master regulator of neural development. Thus NRSF/REST play important roles in both neurogenesis and neurodegeneration. In this review, I summarize the interesting scientific crossover, and discuss the potential use of NRSF/REST as a pharmaceutical target for controlling aging, particularly in relation to brain aging.
