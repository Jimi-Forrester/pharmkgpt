38512674|t|Methods for Biochemical Isolation of Insoluble Tau in Rodent Models of Tauopathies.
38512674|a|The intracellular accumulation of microtubule-associated protein tau is a characteristic feature of tauopathies, a group of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease. Formation of insoluble tau aggregates is initiated by the abnormal hyperphosphorylation and oligomerization of tau. Over the past decades, multiple transgenic rodent models mimicking tauopathies have been develop, showcasing this neuropathological hallmark. The biochemical analysis of insoluble tau in these models has served as a valuable tool to understand the progression of tau-related pathology. In this chapter, we provide a comprehensive review of the two primary methods for isolating insoluble tau, namely, sarkosyl and formic acid extraction (and their variants), which are employed for biochemical analysis in transgenic mouse models of tauopathy. We also analyze the strengths and limitations of these methods.
