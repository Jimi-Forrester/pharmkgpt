28710429|t|The A2V mutation as a new tool for hindering Abeta aggregation: A neutron and x-ray diffraction study.
28710429|a|We have described a novel C-to-T mutation in the APP gene that corresponds to an alanine to valine substitution at position 673 in APP (A673V), or position 2 of the amyloid-beta (Abeta) sequence. This mutation is associated with the early onset of AD-type dementia in homozygous individuals, whereas it has a protective effect in the heterozygous state. Correspondingly, we observed differences in the aggregation properties of the wild-type and mutated Abeta peptides and their mixture. We have carried out neutron diffraction (ND) and x-ray diffraction (XRD) experiments on magnetically-oriented fibers of Abeta1-28WT and its variant Abeta1-28A2V. The orientation propensity was higher for Abeta1-28A2V suggesting that it promotes the formation of fibrillar assemblies. The diffraction patterns by Abeta1-28WT and Abeta1-28A2V assemblies differed in shape and position of the equatorial reflections, suggesting that the two peptides adopt distinct lateral packing of the diffracting units. The diffraction patterns from a mixture of the two peptides differed from those of the single components, indicating the presence of structural interference during assembly and orientation. The lowest orientation propensity was observed for a mixture of Abeta1-28WT and a short N-terminal fragment, Abeta1-6A2V, which supports a role of Abeta's N-terminal domain in amyloid fibril formation.
