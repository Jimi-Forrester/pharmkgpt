34769257|t|Why Have the Benefits of DHA Not Been Borne Out in the Treatment and Prevention of Alzheimer's Disease? A Narrative Review Focused on DHA Metabolism and Adipose Tissue.
34769257|a|Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an omega-3 fatty acid rich in seafood, is linked to Alzheimer's Disease via strong epidemiological and pre-clinical evidence, yet fish oil or other DHA supplementation has not consistently shown benefit to the prevention or treatment of Alzheimer's Disease. Furthermore, autopsy studies of Alzheimer's Disease brain show variable DHA status, demonstrating that the relationship between DHA and neurodegeneration is complex and not fully understood. Recently, it has been suggested that the forms of DHA in the diet and plasma have specific metabolic fates that may affect brain uptake; however, the effect of DHA form on brain uptake is less pronounced in studies of longer duration. One major confounder of studies relating dietary DHA and Alzheimer's Disease may be that adipose tissue acts as a long-term depot of DHA for the brain, but this is poorly understood in the context of neurodegeneration. Future work is required to develop biomarkers of brain DHA and better understand DHA-based therapies in the setting of altered brain DHA uptake to help determine whether brain DHA should remain an important target in the prevention of Alzheimer's Disease.
