29071696|t|Diagnosing and Managing Delirium in Cancer Patients.
29071696|a|Delirium is frequently encountered when caring for cancer patients, from initial diagnosis to the advanced stages of the disease; however, it is often missed. Oncologists need to be familiar with the various defining features of the condition, and should be able to identify common underlying causes. We present a systematic approach to the workup, as well as pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic approaches to management. We discuss the common practice of treatment with neuroleptics, as well as recent controversy surrounding their use.
