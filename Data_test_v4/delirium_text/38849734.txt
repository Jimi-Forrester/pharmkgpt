38849734|a|BACKGROUND: We aimed to compare the analgesic effects of intravenous ibuprofen to ketorolac after open abdominal hysterectomy. METHODS: This randomized double-blinded controlled trial included adult women scheduled for elective open abdominal hysterectomy. Participants were randomized to receive either 30 mg ketorolac (n = 50) or 800 mg ibuprofen (n = 50) preoperatively, then every 8 h postoperatively for 24 h. All participants received paracetamol 1 gm/6 h. Rescue analgesic was given if the visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain assessment was > 3. The primary outcome was the mean postoperative dynamic VAS during the first 24 h. Secondary outcomes were static VAS, intraoperative fentanyl consumption, postoperative morphine consumption, time to independent movement, and patient's satisfaction. RESULTS: Forty-six patients in the ibuprofen group and fifty patients in the ketorolac group were analyzed. The 24-h dynamic and static VAS were similar in the two groups. The median (quartiles) dynamic VAS was 1.1 (0.9, 1.9) in the ibuprofen group versus 1.0 (0.7, 1.3) in the ketorolac group, P-value = 0.116; and the median (quartiles) static VAS was 0.9 (0.6, 1.3) in the ibuprofen group versus 0.7 (0.4, 1.1) in the ketorolac group, P-value = 0.113. The intra- and postoperative analgesic requirements were also similar in the two groups. However, patient satisfaction was slightly higher in the ketorolac group than that in the ibuprofen group (median [quartiles]: 6 [5, 7] versus 5 [4, 7], respectively), P-value: 0.009. CONCLUSION: The two drugs, intravenous ibuprofen and ketorolac produced similar analgesic profile in patients undergoing open abdominal hysterectomy receiving multimodal analgesic regimen.
