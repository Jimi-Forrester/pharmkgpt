32517362|t|The Stemness of Human Ovarian Granulosa Cells and the Role of Resveratrol in the Differentiation of MSCs-A Review Based on Cellular and Molecular Knowledge.
32517362|a|Ovarian Granulosa Cells (GCs) are known to proliferate in the developing follicle and undergo several biochemical processes during folliculogenesis. They represent a multipotent cell population that has been differentiated to neuronal cells, chondrocytes, and osteoblasts in vitro. However, progression and maturation of GCs are accompanied by a reduction in their stemness. In the developing follicle, GCs communicate with the oocyte bidirectionally via gap junctions. Together with neighboring theca cells, they play a crucial role in steroidogenesis, particularly the production of estradiol, as well as progesterone following luteinization. Many signaling pathways are known to be important throughout the follicle development, leading either towards luteinization and release of the oocyte, or follicular atresia and apoptosis. These signaling pathways include cAMP, PI3K, SMAD, Hedgehog (HH), Hippo and Notch, which act together in a complex manner to control the maturation of GCs through regulation of key genes, from the primordial follicle to the luteal phase. Small molecules such as resveratrol, a phytoalexin found in grapes, peanuts and other dietary constituents, may be able to activate/inhibit these signaling pathways and thereby control physiological properties of GCs. This article reviews the current knowledge about granulosa stem cells, the signaling pathways driving their development and maturation, as well as biological activities of resveratrol and its properties as a pro-differentiation agent.
