39324658|a|Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is the leading cause of vascular dementia among the elderly. Neuropsychiatric symptoms are commonly manifested in cerebral amyloid angiopathy patients but are usually considered as consequences of cerebral amyloid angiopathy pathology. Here, it is reported that chronic stress promotes cerebral amyloid angiopathy progression, which enhances deposition of amyloid protein beta (Abeta) in brain blood vessels and exacerbates subsequent brain injury. Mechanistically, neutrophil is implicated in cerebral amyloid angiopathy development. Abeta that accumulates in brain vasculature induces neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) by activating STAT6 signaling, which inhibits neutrophil apoptosis and switches the programmed cell death toward NETosis. During chronic stress, circulatory Norepinephrine (NE) strengthens STAT6 activation in neutrophil and promotes NET formation, thus exacerbates the NET-dependent angiopathy. It is demonstrated that inhibiting neutrophil chemotaxis towards brain or suppressing NET formation both ameliorate cerebral amyloid angiopathy severity in the context of chronic stress. Therefore, it is proposed that stress-associated psychological disorders and NETs are promising therapeutic targets in cerebral amyloid angiopathy.
