20930313|a|Noninvasive detection of amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposits in the brain would be beneficial for an early and presymptomatic diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We developed THK-265 as a candidate near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) probe for the in vivo detection of amyloid deposits in the brain. The maximal emission wavelength of THK-265 was greater than 650nm and it showed high quantum yield and molar absorption coefficients. A fluorescence binding assay showed its high binding affinity to Abeta fibrils (Kd = 97 nM). THK-265 clearly stained amyloid plaques in AD neocortical brain sections and showed a moderate log p value (1.8). After intravenous administration of THK-265 in amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP) transgenic mice, amyloid deposits in the brain were clearly labeled with THK-265. Furthermore, in vivo NIRF imaging demonstrated significantly higher fluorescence intensity in the brains of AbetaPP transgenic mice than in those of wild-type mice. As THK-265 showed profound hyperchromic effect upon binding to Abeta fibrils, good discrimination between AbetaPP transgenic and wild-type mice was demonstrated even early after THK-265 administration. Furthermore, the fluorescence intensity of THK-265 correlated with amyloid plaque burden in the brains of AbetaPP transgenic mice. These findings strongly support the usefulness of THK-265 as an NIRF imaging probe for the noninvasive measurement of brain amyloid load.
