In order to test the sensitivity of spectral power and hemispheric coherence to changes in cholinergic transmission, we evaluated quantitative magnetoencephalogram (MEG) after intravenous injection of scopolamine. METHODS: MEG of 8 elderly healthy subjects (59-80 years) were measured with a whole-head magnetometer after intravenous injection of scopolamine. An injection of glycopyrrolate, a peripheral muscarinic antagonist, was used as the placebo in a double-blind, randomized, cross-over design. Spectral power and coherence were computed over 7 brain regions in 3 frequency bands. RESULTS: Scopolamine administration increased theta activity (4-8 Hz) and resulted in the abnormal pattern of MEG desynchronization in eyes-open vs. eyes-closed conditions in the alpha band (8-13 Hz). These effects were most prominent over the posterior regions. Interhemispheric and left intrahemispheric coherence was significantly decreased in the theta band (4-8 Hz). CONCLUSIONS: Spontaneous cortical activity at the theta and alpha range and functional coupling in the theta band are modulated by the cholinergic system. MEG may provide a tool for monitoring brain dynamics in neurological disorders associated with cholinergic abnormalities.
