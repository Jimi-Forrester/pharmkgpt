39203576|t|Gut Microbes Associated with Neurodegenerative Disorders: A Comprehensive Review of the Literature.
39203576|a|Evidence shows that neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders are influenced by alterations in the gut microbiome. Various diseases have been linked to microbiome dysbiosis, yet there are inconclusive data regarding which microorganisms are associated with each disorder. The aim of our study is to systematically review the recent literature of the past decade to clarify whether the gut microbiome contributes to the understanding of pathogenesis and progression of neurodegenerative disorders. Most included studies showed a strong correlation between the relative abundance of certain microorganisms, mainly species of the phyla Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, and disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). It is speculated that the microorganisms and their byproducts have a significant role in brain protein accumulation, neuro-inflammation, and gut permeability. The estimation of microbial populations could potentially improve clinical outcomes and hinder the progression of the disease. However, further research is needed to include more diseases and larger patient samples and identify specific species and subspecies associated with these disorders.
