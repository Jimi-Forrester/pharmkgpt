34690368|t|Regulation of autophagy by miRNAs in human diseases.
34690368|a|Autophagy is a homeostatic process designed to eliminate dysfunctional and aging organelles and misfolded proteins through a well-concerted pathway, starting with forming a double-membrane vesicle and culminating in the lysosomal degradation of the cargo enclosed inside the mature vesicle. As a vital sentry of cellular health, autophagy is regulated in every human disease condition and is an essential target for non-coding RNAs like microRNAs (miRNAs). miRNAs are short oligonucleotides that specifically bind to the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of target mRNAs, thus leading to mRNA silencing, degradation, or translation blockage. This review summarizes the recent findings regarding the regulation of autophagy and autophagy-related genes by different miRNAs in various pathological conditions, including cancer, kidney and liver disorders, neurodegeneration, cardiovascular disorders, infectious diseases, aging-related conditions, and inflammation-related diseases. As miRNAs are being identified as prime regulators of autophagy in human disease, pharmacological molecules and traditional medicines targeting these miRNAs are also being tested in disease models, thus initiating a new series of therapeutic interventions targeting autophagy.
