35935320|t|Comparison and Clinical Value of Ciprofol and Propofol in Intraoperative Adverse Reactions, Operation, Resuscitation, and Satisfaction of Patients under Painless Gastroenteroscopy Anesthesia.
35935320|a|Objective: To investigate the comparison and clinical value of ciprofol and propofol for painless gastroenteroscopy anesthesia in terms of intraoperative adverse reactions, operation, resuscitation, and satisfaction of patients. Methods: A total of 96 patients who underwent painless gastroenteroscopy anesthesia in our hospital from June 2021 to January 2022 were enrolled. The cases were randomly assigned into research group and control group. The control group received propofol anesthesia (n = 49), and the research group received ciprofol anesthesia (n = 47). The patients, physician satisfaction, vital signs, incidence of adverse reactions, anesthetic first dose, additional time, additional dose, total dose, induction time, insertion time, operation time, awake time, orientation recovery time, leaving room time, and injection pain score were compared. Results: The overall satisfaction of the study group was higher than that of the control group (p < 0.05). After taking medicine, the score of 1 min and MAP in the study group were higher than those in the control group. The incidence of adverse reactions in the study group was lower than that in the control group (p < 0.05). The satisfaction of doctors in the study group was higher than that in the control group (p < 0.05). The anesthesia induction time, intubation time, operation time, awake time, orientation recovery time, and leaving room time in the study group were significantly longer than those in the control group (p < 0.05). The incidence and degree of injection pain in the propofol group were significantly lower than those in the propofol group (p < 0.05). Conclusion: In painless gastroenteroscopy, compared with propofol, ciprofol is equally safe and effective for patients and will not cause early cognitive dysfunction after operation, which is a good choice in painless gastroenteroscopy anesthesia. In addition, ciprofol has significant advantages in patient and physician satisfaction, especially in injection pain. This trial is registered with ChiCTR2100045400.
