34319632|t|Variability in the type and layer distribution of cortical Abeta pathology in familial Alzheimer's disease.
34319632|a|Familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) is caused by autosomal dominant mutations in the PSEN1, PSEN2 or APP genes, giving rise to considerable clinical and pathological heterogeneity in FAD. Here we investigate variability in clinical data and the type and distribution of Abeta pathologies throughout the cortical layers of different FAD mutation cases. Brain tissue from 20 FAD cases [PSEN1 pre-codon 200 (n = 10), PSEN1 post-codon 200 (n = 6), APP (n = 4)] were investigated. Frontal cortex sections were stained immunohistochemically for Abeta, and Nissl to define the cortical layers. The frequency of different amyloid-beta plaque types was graded for each cortical layer and the severity of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) was determined in cortical and leptomeningeal blood vessels. Comparisons were made between FAD mutations and APOE4 status, with associations between pathology, clinical and genetic data investigated. In this cohort, possession of an APOE4 allele was associated with increased disease duration but not with age at onset, after adjusting for mutation sub-group and sex. We found Abeta pathology to be heterogeneous between cases although Abeta load was highest in cortical layer 3 for all mutation groups and a higher Abeta load was associated with APOE4. The PSEN1 post-codon 200 group had a higher Abeta load in lower cortical layers, with a small number of this group having increased cotton wool plaque pathology in lower layers. Cotton wool plaque frequency was positively associated with the severity of CAA in the whole cohort and in the PSEN1 post-codon 200 group. Carriers of the same PSEN1 mutation can have differing patterns of Abeta deposition, potentially because of differences in risk factors. Our results highlight possible influences of APOE4 genotype, and PSEN1 mutation type on Abeta deposition, which may have effects on the clinical heterogeneity of FAD.
