16497438|t|Evaluation of total cerebral blood flow volume in cerebral atrophy.
16497438|a|The goal of our study is to determine total cerebral blood flow volume (tCBFV) via extracranial Doppler ultrasound and to investigate its value in the differential diagnosis of dementia. Twenty-eight outpatients with cerebral atrophy confirmed by cranial computed tomography were enrolled into the study. Nine patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and nine patients with vascular dementia (VaD) based on neuropsychologic test and imaging findings, as well as 10 neurologically normal elderly subjects underwent Doppler sonographic examination of extracranial internal carotid artery (ICA) and vertebral artery (VA). Angle corrected time averaged flow velocity and cross-sectional areas of vessels have been measured. Flow volumes and tCBFV have been calculated. The measures of tCBFV, anterior CBFV (aCBFV), right CBFV (rCBFV) and right ICA flow volume were significantly lower in patients with dementia. The amounts of tCBFV, aCBFV, rCBFV and right ICA flow volume have been found to be low in AD and VaD patients compared with normal elderly group. Of all parameters measured for AD and VaD, no significant difference was found except Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reporting the CBF measurements using Doppler ultrasound of extracranial ICA and VA in the differential diagnosis of dementia in cerebral atrophy. The tCBFV, aCBFV, rCBFV and right ICA flow volumes and MMSE scores are significant in the diagnosis of dementia, whereas only MMSE scores are significant in the differential diagnosis of AD and VaD.
