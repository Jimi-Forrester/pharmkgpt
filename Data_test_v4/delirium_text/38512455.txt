38512455|a|OBJECTIVE: We examined cases in which delirium developed after thoracic surgery under general anesthesia at our hospital to determine the predictive factors for postoperative delirium, as well as the perioperative findings in cases showing postoperative delirium. METHODS: This retrospective study included 1674 patients who underwent surgery under general anesthesia at our hospital between 2012 and 2022, A psychiatrist diagnosed postoperative delirium using the Confusion Assessment Method. RESULTS: There were 99 (5.9%) patients with postoperative delirium in our study, including 85 (86%) men, of whom 31 (31%) had a history of cerebrovascular disease. The incidence of postoperative delirium in patients aged > 80 years was 20% (36/182). The postoperative delirium group showed significantly longer hospital stays and more frequent postoperative complications than the group without postoperative delirium. In univariate analysis, age >= 80 years, male sex, history of cerebrovascular disease, hypertension, history of atrial fibrillation, and history of smoking were identified as significant factors, while multivariate analysis identified age >= 80 years, male sex, history of cerebrovascular disease, hypertension, and history of smoking as significant factors (odds ratios = 5.15, 2.04, 3.10, 1.67, and 2.36, respectively). In the 169 cases with none of these five factors, the postoperative delirium risk was 0% (0/169). CONCLUSIONS: In patients undergoing thoracic surgery, predictive factors for postoperative delirium include age >= 80 years, male sex, history of cerebrovascular disease, hypertension, and smoking history. The findings also indicate that patients with these risk factors may require psychiatric consultation before surgery.
