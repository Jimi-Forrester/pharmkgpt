32703978|a|The molecular shield effect was studied for intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) that do not adopt compact and stable protein folds. IDPs are found among many stress-responsive gene products and cryoprotective- and drought-protective proteins. We recently reported that some fragments of human genome-derived IDPs are cryoprotective for cellular enzymes, despite a lack of relevant amino acid sequence motifs. This sequence-independent IDP function may reflect their molecular shield effect. This study examined the inhibitory activity of IDPs against fibril formation in an amyloid beta peptide (Abeta(1-42)) model system. Four of five human genome-derived IDPs (size range 20 to 44 amino acids) showed concentration-dependent inhibition of amyloid formation (IC50 range between 60 and 130 muM against 20 muM Abeta(1-42)). The IC50 value was two orders of magnitude lower than that of polyethylene-glycol and dextran, used as neutral hydrophilic polymer controls. Nuclear magnetic resonance with 15 N-labeled Abeta(1-42) revealed no relevant molecular interactions between Abeta(1-42) and IDPs. The inhibitory activities were abolished by adding external amyloid-formation seeds. Therefore, IDPs seemed to act only at the amyloid nucleation phase but not at the elongation phase. These results suggest that IDPs (0.1 mM or less) have a molecular shield effect that prevents aggregation of susceptible molecules.
