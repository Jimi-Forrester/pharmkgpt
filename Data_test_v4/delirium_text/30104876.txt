30104876|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are the two most common neurodegenerative diseases. Recent studies have sought to identify precursor symptoms of AD and PD that occur before the onset of the disease. We evaluated changes in the oral mucosa of patients with AD and PD using a stereological method. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included 29 patients with AD, 30 patients with idiopathic PD, and 30 healthy volunteers. Brush biopsies were obtained from all participants, and the nucleator method was used to estimate the volume of cells obtained from the buccal mucosa. RESULTS: Cytomorphometric analysis revealed that the nuclear volume was 484.39+-117.10 microm3 in the AD group, 509.71+-132.26 microm3 in PD patients, and 509.30+-100.21 microm3 in the control group. The cytoplasmic volume was 115,456.60+-30,664.98 microm3 in the AD group, 103,097.93+-25,034.65 microm3 in PD patients, and 109,528.45+-28,381.43 microm3 in the control group. The nuclear and cytoplasmic volumes were not significantly different among groups (P>0.05). CONCLUSION: The cytomorphometric analysis revealed no significant differences in the cytoplasmic and nuclear volumes of buccal cells obtained from patients with AD and PD and healthy volunteers.
