38220444|a|Objective: The present retrospective study aimed to analyses the ventilation efficacy and safety of new nasopharyngeal airway applied in left atrial appendage occlusion. Methods: A total of 37 advanced aged patients diagnosed with atrial fibrillation(>65 years)who underwent left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) in Xuanwu Hospital of Capital Medical University from March 2021 to March 2022 were enrolled in this study. All patients received supplemental oxygen by a new nasopharyngeal airway to ensure intraoperative ventilation. The primary outcome was the occurrence of hypoxemia. The secondary outcomes included the incidence of hypotension after anesthesia, the incidence of body movement during surgery, significant fluctuations of the vital signs such as mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), saturation of pulse oxygen (SpO2) and respiratory rate (RR) at different time points (T1: pre-operation; T2: at the time of placing nasopharyngeal airway; T3: at the time of placing transesophageal echocardiography(TEE); T4: at the time of TEE intraoperative exploration; T5: end of the surgery; T6: at the time of patient woke up), and the incidence of postoperative adverse events. Results: There were 24 males and 13 females with a mean age of (73.8+-7.7) years. The incidence of hypoxemia was 16.2% (6/37), which could return to normal after simple treatment. The incidence of hypotension was 27.0% (10/37), occurred after anesthesia induction mainly.32.4% (12/37) of the patients experienced movements, but no adverse events led to surgical termination. MAP at different time points was significantly different (P=0.001), but other vital signs of HR, SpO2 and RR were not significantly different(all P>0.05), without serious hemodynamic fluctuations. The incidence of postoperative adverse cardiovascular events was 10.8% (4/37), and delirium was 2.7% (1/37). All patients successfully completed the surgery and were safely discharged from the hospital. Conclusion: The new nasopharyngeal airway can meet the requirements of airway management during left atrial appendage occlusion under intravenous anesthesia without serious adverse events.
