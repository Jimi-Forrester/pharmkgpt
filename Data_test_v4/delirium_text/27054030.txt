27054030|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders in the elderly. Although the mechanisms underlying AD neurodegeneration are not fully understood, it is well recognized that inflammation plays a crucial role in the initiation and/or deterioration of AD neurodegeneration. Increasing evidence suggests that different cytokines, including interleukins, TNF-alpha, TGF-beta and IFN-gamma, are actively participated in AD pathogenesis and may serve as diagnostic or therapeutic targets for AD neurodegeneration. Here, we review the progress in understanding the important role that these cytokines or neuroinflammation has played in AD etiology and pathogenesis.
