35082259|a|Interactions between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria have received insufficient attention until recently. However, distorted contacts between the ER and mitochondria were identified as an important factor in the etiopathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In view of these new data, the mechanisms of ER-mitochondrial interactions are necessary to study in detail in order to develop new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to neurodegenerative diseases and to extend basic knowledge of the physiology of the eukaryotic cell. The review focuses on the functions of mitochondria-associated ER membranes (MAMs). Structural elements of the MAM system, their contributions to the vital cell functions (calcium and lipid homeostasis, autophagy, fusion and division of mitochondria, and the regulation of their number), and the role of MAM dysfunctions in the pathogenesis of various neurodegenerative diseases are considered.
