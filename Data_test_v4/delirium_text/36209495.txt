36209495|a|INTRODUCTION: The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) aims to validate biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD) clinical trials. To improve generalizability, ADNI4 aims to enroll 50-60% of its new participants from underrepresented populations (URPs) using new biofluid and digital technologies. ADNI4 has received funding from the National Institute on Aging beginning September 2022. METHODS: ADNI4 will recruit URPs using community-engaged approaches. An online portal will screen 20,000 participants, 4000 of whom (50-60% URPs) will be tested for plasma biomarkers and APOE. From this, 500 new participants will undergo in-clinic assessment joining 500 ADNI3 rollover participants. Remaining participants (~3500) will undergo longitudinal plasma and digital cognitive testing. ADNI4 will add MRI sequences and new PET tracers. Project 1 will optimize biomarkers in AD clinical trials. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: ADNI4 will improve generalizability of results, use remote digital and blood screening, and continue providing longitudinal clinical, biomarker, and autopsy data to investigators.
