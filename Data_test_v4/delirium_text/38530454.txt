38530454|t|Effectiveness of remimazolam in preventing postoperative delirium in elderly patients with proximal femoral fractures.
38530454|a|PURPOSE: Elderly patients with proximal femoral fractures are known to be a high-risk group for postoperative delirium (POD). The aim of this study was to determine the association of the benzodiazepine drug remimazolam with POD in elderly patients with proximal femoral fractures. METHODS: In this single-center retrospective observational study, we included patients aged 65 years or older who underwent general anesthesia for proximal femoral fractures. We collected data for the incidence of POD within 3 days after surgery. We also obtained data for complications, preoperative blood examinations, maintenance anesthetic and intraoperative vital data. The occurrence of POD in patients who received remimazolam for general anesthesia (remimazolam group) was compared to that in patients who received general anesthesia with other anesthetic agents (other group). We finally conducted a multivariate analysis to assess the independent association of remimazolam with the risk of POD. RESULTS: A total of 230 patients, including 54 patients who received remimazolam for maintenance anesthesia, were included in this study. The incidence of POD in the patients was 26.1%. The incidence of delirium within 3 days after surgery was significantly lower in the remimazolam group than in the other group (14.8% vs. 29.5%, p  =  0.03). The multivariate analysis showed that the use of remimazolam independently reduced the occurrence of POD (adjusted odds ratio  =  0.42, p  =  0.04). CONCLUSION: This retrospective observational study showed that the use of remimazolam is independently associated with a reduced incidence of POD. Remimazolam may be considered as an option to reduce POD in elderly patients with proximal femoral fractures.
