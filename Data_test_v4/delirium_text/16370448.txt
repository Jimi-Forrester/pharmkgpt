16370448|a|The number of older adults in the general population continues to grow. As their numbers rise, the elderly and the management of their medical problems must be of increasing concern for health-care professionals. Within this older population, cancer is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Although many studies have looked at the psychiatric implications of cancer in the general population, few studies tackle the issues that may face the older adult with cancer. This article focuses on the detection and treatment of depression, anxiety, fatigue, pain, delirium, and dementia in the elderly cancer patient.
