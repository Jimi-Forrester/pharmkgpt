22817324|a|Age-dependent accumulation of the amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) in the brain is a pre-condition for development of Alzheimer's disease. A relative increase in the generation of longer Abeta species such as Abeta42 and Abeta43 is critical for Abeta deposition, but the underlying mechanism remains unresolved. Here, we performed a cell-free assay using microsome fractions of temporal cortex tissues from 42 cynomolgus monkeys and found that Abeta40-generating gamma-secretase activity (gamma40) decreased with age, whereas Abeta42-generating gamma-secretase activity (gamma42) was unaltered. In ELISAs, more than 80% of monkeys over 20-years old showed evidence of Abeta accumulation in the temporal cortex. The ratio of gamma42 to gamma40 increased with age and correlated with the level of accumulated Abeta. These results suggest that gamma-secretase activity undergoes age-related, non-genetic modulation and that this modulation may cause Abeta accumulation in aging brains. Similar modulation may predispose aged human brains to Alzheimer's disease.
