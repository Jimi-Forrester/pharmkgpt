11606220|t|Identification of the molecular interaction site of amyloid beta peptide by using a fluorescence assay.
11606220|a|Beta-amyloid peptides (Abeta) are the main protein components of neuritic plaques and are important in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. It is reported that Abeta itself is not toxic; however, it becomes toxic to neuronal cells once it has aggregated into amyloid fibrils by peptide-peptide interactions. In this study, to specify the molecular mechanism of aggregation, a novel fluorescence assay was designed. For this purpose, possible partial peptides (38 types of 5-mer) were synthesized on solid-phase. The molecular interactions were examined by a fluorescence probe possessing Lys-Leu-Val-Phe-Phe (KLVFF) as a molecular recognition site. KLVFF is known to be a minimum sequence for formation of the Abeta aggregate. A specific interaction was observed between labeled and immobilized KLVFF. It suggests that the aggregation of Abeta was controlled by the recognition of KLVFF itself by hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions.
