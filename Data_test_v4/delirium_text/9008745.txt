9008745|a|Using explicit criteria contained in the DSM III R, we collected in a prospective cohort study clinical features, outcome and risk factors from two cohorts of delirium in hospitalized elderly patients: 138 hospitalized in geriatric department and 45 patients admitted to an acute and comprehensive care hospital. The clinical features were assessed using a quantitative scale (developed by Derouesne). Delirium was unrecognized or misdiagnosed by physicians in 34% of the cases. The onset was known only two thirds of cases. The incidence of hyperactive type, prolonged hospital stay, poor outcomes (persistent delirium leading up to dementia) were highest in subjects admitted in comprehensive hospital. The etiology of delirium is complex and multifactorial. An underlying cause was identified in 80% of patients. The length or the worsening of delirium was significantly higher in patients with psychiatric or dementia comorbidity (OR: 0.2; IC 95%: 0.1-0.5). The prognosis was better in patients without psychoactive medications (OR: 0.2; IC 95%: 0.1-0.4) or with metabolic abnormalities or acute diseases and disorders (OR: 3.3; IC 95%: 1.5-7.6). The predisposing factors to the development of dementia were prior use of psychoactive medications and signs of prior cognitive impairment. This article suggests delirium in elderly patients is associated with several outcomes. The prognosis should be improved at admission by specific scale and an evaluation of predisposing and precipitating factors.
