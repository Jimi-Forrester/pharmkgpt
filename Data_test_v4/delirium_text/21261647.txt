21261647|a|Stilbenoid compounds consist of a family of resveratrol derivatives. They have demonstrated promising activities in vitro and in vivo that indicate they may be useful in the prevention of a wide range of pathologies, such as cardiovascular diseases and cancers, as well have anti-aging effects. More recently stilbenoid compounds have shown promise in the treatment and prevention of neurodegenerative disorders, such as Huntington's, Parkinson's, and Alzheimer's diseases. This paper primarily focuses on the impact of stilbenoids in Alzheimer's disease and more specifically on the inhibition of beta-amyloid peptide aggregation.
