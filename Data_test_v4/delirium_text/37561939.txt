37561939|a|INTRODUCTION: Depressive symptomatology is often associated with the onset of dementia, although the exact form and directionality of this association is still unclear. The aim of this study is to investigate whether depressive symptomatology at the time of dementia diagnosis was predictive of cognitive, functional, and behavioral decline over 1 year. METHODS: In a Rural and Remote Memory Clinic, 375 patients consecutively diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer disease, or non-Alzheimer disease dementia completed the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale at first visit and 1-year follow-up to assess depressive symptomatology. The same cohort was evaluated for cognitive, functional, and behavioral decline through the completion of 5 clinical tests performed at the first visit and at 1-year follow-up. RESULTS: Depressive symptomatology at time of dementia diagnosis did not predict cognitive or functional decline over 1 year, although increases in depressive symptomatology over 1 year significantly correlated with higher caregiver ratings of neuropsychiatric symptom severity and related distress over that time. CONCLUSION: Increasingly severe depressive symptomatology over 1 year correlated with greater caregiver distress. This study points the way for future studies delineating the relationship between depression, dementia progression, and caregiver distress.
