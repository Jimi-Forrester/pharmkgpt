39497013|a|BACKGROUND: Septic encephalopathy is frequent but its pathophysiology is enigmatic. We studied expression of neurotransmitters, inflammation and integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in several brain regions during abdominal sepsis. We compared mice with either lethal or surviving phenotype in the first 4 sepsis days. Mature CD-1 females underwent cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). Body temperature (BT) was measured daily and predicted-to-die (within 24 h) mice (for P-DIE; BT < 28  C) were sacrificed together (1:1 ratio) with mice predicted-to-survive (P-SUR; BT > 35  C), and healthy controls (CON). Brains were dissected into neocortex, cerebellum, midbrain, medulla, striatum, hypothalamus and hippocampus. RESULTS: CLP mice showed an up to threefold rise of serotonin in the hippocampus, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic and homovanillic acid (HVA) in nearly all regions vs. CON. Compared to P-SUR, P-DIE mice showed a 1.7 to twofold rise of HVA (386 ng/g of tissue), dopamine (265 ng/g) and 3,4-Dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC; 140 ng/g) in the hippocampus, hypothalamus and medulla (174, 156, 82 ng/g of tissue, respectively). CLP increased expression of TNFalpha, IL-1beta and IL-6 mRNA by several folds in the midbrain, cerebellum and hippocampus versus CON. The same cytokines were further elevated in P-DIE vs P-SUR in the midbrain and cerebellum. Activation of astrocytes and microglia was robust across regions but remained typically phenotype independent. There was a similar influx of sodium fluorescein across the BBB in both P-DIE and P-SUR mice. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to survivors, the lethal phenotype induced a stronger deregulation of amine metabolism and cytokine expression in selected brain regions, but the BBB permeability remained similar regardless of the predicted outcome.
