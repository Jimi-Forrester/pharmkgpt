39040287|a|Background: Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA)-NONMMUT020270.2 is downregulated and co-expressed with inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor type 2 (ITPR2) in the hippocampus of Alzheimer's disease (AD) mice. However, whether the expression of ITPR2 was regulated by lncRNA-NONMMUT020270.2 remains unclear. we aimed to investigate regulating relationship of lncRNA-NONMMUT020270.2 and ITPR2. Methods: HT22 cells were firstly transfected with the pcDNA3.1-lncRNA-NONMMUT020270.2 overexpression plasmid or with the lncRNA-NONMMUT020270.2 smart silencer, and then were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 24h. The mRNA expression levels of lncRNA-NONMMUT020270.2 and ITPR2 were measured by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR. Cell viability was assessed using a Cell Counting Kit 8 assay. The expression of Abeta1-42 was detected by ELISA. The expression levels of p-tau, caspase-1, and inositol trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) proteins were detected by western-blotting. Nuclear morphological changes were detected by Hoechst staining. Flow cytometry and Fluo-3/AM were carried out to determine cell apoptosis and the intracellular Ca2+. Results: LPS significantly decreased cell viability, and ITPR2 mRNA and IP3R protein expression levels. While it markedly enhanced the expression levels of p-tau and Abeta1-42, cell apoptosis rate, as well as intracellular Ca2+ concentration (P < 0.05). In addition, lncRNA-NONMMUT020270.2 overexpression significantly increased the expressions levels of ITPR2 mRNA and IP3R protein (P < 0.05), and inhibited expression of p-tau and Abeta1-42, cell apoptosis rate, and reduced intracellular Ca2+ concentration (P < 0.05). By contrast, lncRNA-NONMMUT020270.2 silencing notably downregulated expressions levels of ITPR2 mRNA and IP3R protein (P < 0.05), and elevated expression levels of p-tau and Abeta1-42, cell apoptosis rate, and intracellular Ca2+ concentration (P < 0.05). Conclusion: lncRNA-NONMMUT020270.2 was positively correlated with ITPR2 expression in LPS-induced cell. Downregulating the lncRNA-NONMMUT020270.2 and ITPR2 may promote cell apoptosis and increase intracellular Ca2+ concentration.
