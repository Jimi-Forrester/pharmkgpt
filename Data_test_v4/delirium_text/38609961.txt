38609961|a|BACKGROUND: Polyalthia suberosa (Roxb.) Thwaites (Annonaceae) is a medicinal plant that has been reported for its various pharmacological potentials, such as its anti-inflammatory, analgesic, antioxidant, and neuropharmacological activities. This study aimed to analyze the leaf essential oils of P. suberosa (PSLO) collected in different seasons, to evaluate the acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity, and to corroborate the obtained results via in-silico molecular docking studies. METHODS: The leaf essential oils of P. suberosa collected in different seasons were analyzed separately by GC/MS. The acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity of the leaves oil was assessed via colorimetric assay. In-silico molecular docking studies were elucidated by virtual docking of the main compounds identified in P. suberosa leaf essential oil to the active sites in human acetylcholinesterase crystal structure. RESULTS: A total of 125 compounds were identified where D-limonene (0.07 - 24.7%), alpha-copaene (2.25 - 15.49%), E-beta-caryophyllene (5.17 - 14.42%), 24-noroleana-3,12-diene (12.92%), beta-pinene (0.14 - 8.59%), and alpha-humulene (2.49-6.9%) were the most abundant components. Results showed a noteworthy influence of the collection season on the chemical composition and yield of the volatile oils. The tested oil adequately inhibited acetylcholinesterase enzyme with an IC50 value of 91.94 microg/mL. Additionally, in-silico molecular docking unveiled that palmitic acid, phytol, p-cymene, and caryophyllene oxide demonstrated the highest fitting scores within the active sites of human acetylcholinesterase enzyme. CONCLUSIONS: From these findings, it is concluded that P. suberosa leaf oil should be evaluated as a food supplement for enhancing memory.
