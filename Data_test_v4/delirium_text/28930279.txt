28930279|t|Comparative Evaluation of Oxidative Stress Modulating and DNA Protective Activities of Aqueous and Methanolic Extracts of Acacia catechu.
28930279|a|Background: Plant-derived bioactive compounds are becoming immensely important as potential drugs. Different solvents are being used for extraction of these phytochemicals. Evaluation of biological activities of aqueous plant extracts is important as water soluble compounds would be more beneficial with respect to certification, safety and commercial issues. Oxidative stress is involved in development of many diseases; therefore, antioxidants are now being looked upon as convincing therapeutics against such diseases. Natural antioxidants are in high demand because of their lesser side effects. This study aims to compare the antioxidant activity of aqueous and methanolic extracts of Acacia catechu-a traditional medicinal plant. Methods: The activity was examined using different in vitro systems including radical scavenging activity, lipid peroxidation and inhibition of  OH radical induced DNA damage using standard protocols. Results: Both aqueous and methanolic extracts of Acacia catechu show significant activities with no differences in the efficacies of water and methanol soluble bioactive compounds. Conclusions: Present study revealed that aqueous extract of A. catechu has equal potential to be used as antioxidants as compared to methanolic extract. This can contribute to increased demand of physiologically compatible bioactive compounds of natural origin.
