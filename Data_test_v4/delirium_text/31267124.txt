31267124|t|Relationships between objectives sleep parameters and brain amyloid load in subjects at risk for Alzheimer's disease: the INSIGHT-preAD Study.
31267124|a|STUDY OBJECTIVES: Sleep changes have been associated with increased risks of developing cognitive disturbances and Alzheimer's disease (AD). A bidirectional relation is underlined between amyloid-beta (Ass) and sleep disruptions. The sleep profile in participants at risk to develop AD is not fully deciphered. We aim to investigate sleep-wake changes with objective sleep measurements in elderly participants without cognitive impairment depending on their brain amyloid status, positive (Ass+) or negative (Ass-) based on standard absorption ratios (SUVr) positron emission tomography-florbetapir imaging. METHODS: Sixty-eight participants without cognitive impairment who have accepted to be involved in the sleep ancillary study from the InveStIGation of Alzheimer's Predictors in Subjective Memory Complainers (INSIGHT-pre AD) cohort, aiming to record sleep profile based on the analyses of an ambulatory accelerometer-based assessment (seven consecutive 24-hour periods). Neuropsychological tests were performed and sleep parameters have been individualized by actigraph. Participants also underwent a magnetic resonance imaging scan to assess their hippocampal volume. Based on SUVr PET-florbetapir imaging, two groups Ass+ and Ass- were compared. RESULTS: Participants were divided into two groups: Ass+ (n = 24) and Ass- (n = 44). Except for the SUVr, the two subgroups were comparable. When looking to sleep parameters, increased sleep latency, sleep fragmentation (wake after sleep onset [WASO] score and awakenings) and worst sleep efficiency were associated with cortical brain amyloid load. CONCLUSION: Actigraphic sleep parameters were associated with cortical brain amyloid load in participants at risk to develop AD. The detection of sleep abnormalities in those participants may be of interest to propose some preventive strategies.
