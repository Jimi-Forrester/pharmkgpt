7309417|a|Central transmission time (CTT) between the first and fifth wave of the brainstem auditory evoked potential (BAEP) was assessed in a group of patients clinically diagnosed as suffering from presenile dementia of the Alzheimer's type. CTT was significantly longer in patients compared to healthy young and elderly volunteers. Age per se did not result in prolonged peak latencies or CTT. These results indicate that far-field and early near-field evoked potentials may be of utility in early diagnosis of central nervous system dysfunction associated with diffuse degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and related diseases.
