36982655|t|Altered Tryptophan-Kynurenine Pathway in Delirium: A Review of the Current Literature.
36982655|a|Delirium, a common form of acute brain dysfunction, is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, especially in older patients. The underlying pathophysiology of delirium is not clearly understood, but acute systemic inflammation is known to drive delirium in cases of acute illnesses, such as sepsis, trauma, and surgery. Based on psychomotor presentations, delirium has three main subtypes, such as hypoactive, hyperactive, and mixed subtype. There are similarities in the initial presentation of delirium with depression and dementia, especially in the hypoactive subtype. Hence, patients with hypoactive delirium are frequently misdiagnosed. The altered kynurenine pathway (KP) is a promising molecular pathway implicated in the pathogenesis of delirium. The KP is highly regulated in the immune system and influences neurological functions. The activation of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, and specific KP neuroactive metabolites, such as quinolinic acid and kynurenic acid, could play a role in the event of delirium. Here, we collectively describe the roles of the KP and speculate on its relevance in delirium.
