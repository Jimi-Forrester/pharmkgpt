38076133|t|Advances in the phytochemistry and pharmacology of plant-derived phthalides.
38076133|a|Phthalides are a class of unique compounds such as ligustilide, butylphthalide and butyldenephthalide, which have shown to possess multiple bioactivities in new drug research and development. Phthalides are naturally distributed in different plants that have been utilized as herbal treatments for various ailments with a long history in Asia, Europe and North America. Their extensive biological activity has led to a dramatic increase in the study of phthalide compounds in recent years. This review summarizes the latest research progress of plant-derived phthalides, and a total of 133 phthalide compounds are described based on the characteristics of chemical structures. Pharmacological properties of plant-derived phthalides are associated with hemorheological improvement, vascular function modulation and central nervous system protection. Potential treatments for a variety of diseases mainly including cardio-cerebrovascular disorders and neurological complications such as Alzheimer's disease are also concluded. In addition, key metabolic pathways have been clearly elucidated. Further investigations on the molecular mechanisms involved in biological activity are recommended for offering new insights into profound comprehension of phthalide applications.
