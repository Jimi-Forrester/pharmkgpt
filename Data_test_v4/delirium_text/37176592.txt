37176592|a|The goal of treatment for Alzheimer's dementia (AD) is the restoration of normal cognition. No drug regimen has ever achieved this. This article suggests that curing AD may be achieved by combination therapy as follows. First, with intranasal insulin to augment the body's natural counter-reaction to the changes in brain cell-types that produced the dementia. Second, with edaravone to decrease free radicals, which are increased and causal in AD. Third, as described elsewhere, with one or two drugs from among pioglitazone, fluoxetine, and lithium, which address the brain cell-types whose changed functions cause the dementia. Insulin restores cerebral glucose, which is the main nutrient for brain neurons whose depletion is responsible for the dementia; and edaravone decreases ROS, which are intrinsic causes of neuropathology in AD. This combination of drugs is a potential cure for many patients with AD, and should be tested in a clinical trial.
