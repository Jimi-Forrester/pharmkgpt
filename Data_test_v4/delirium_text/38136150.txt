38136150|t|Novel Fluorometric Assay of Antiglycation Activity Based on Methylglyoxal-Induced Protein Carbonylation.
38136150|a|Advanced glycation end products (AGEs), which can have multiple structures, are formed at the sites where the carbonyl groups of reducing sugars bind to the free amino groups of proteins through the Maillard reaction. Some AGE structures exhibit fluorescence, and this fluorescence has been used to measure the formation and quantitative changes in carbonylated proteins. Recently, fluorescent AGEs have also been used as an index for the evaluation of compounds that inhibit protein glycation. However, the systems used to generate fluorescent AGEs from the reaction of reducing sugars and proteins used for the evaluation of antiglycation activity have not been determined through appropriate research; thus, problems remain regarding sensitivity, quantification, and precision. In the present study, using methylglyoxal (MGO), a reactive carbonyl compound to induce glycation, a comparative analysis of the mechanisms of formation of fluorescent substances from several types of proteins was conducted. The analysis identified hen egg lysozyme (HEL) as a protein that produces stronger fluorescent AGEs faster in the Maillard reaction with MGO. It was also found that the AGE structure produced in MGO-induced in HEL was argpyrimidine. By optimizing the reaction system, we developed a new evaluation method for compounds with antiglycation activity and established an efficient evaluation method (HEL-MGO assay) with greater sensitivity and accuracy than the conventional method, which requires high concentrations of bovine serum albumin and glucose. Furthermore, when compounds known to inhibit glycation were evaluated using this method, their antiglycation activities were clearly and significantly measured, demonstrating the practicality of this method.
