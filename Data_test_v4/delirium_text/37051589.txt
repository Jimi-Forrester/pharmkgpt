37051589|a|Introduction: Acculturation-related characteristics, that is, factors directly connected to culture and familial relationships, are associated with engaged research participation within Latino communities. Despite this, little empirical data exists on whether acculturation changes over time in older Latinos, which has potential implications for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) research study design including longer duration clinical trial implementation. Methods: Self-identified Latinos (n = 222; mean age = 71, 76% female) participating in one of three ongoing longitudinal community-based cohort studies of aging who reported their nativity outside of the United States/District of Columbia (US/DC) contributed, on average, 4.0 +- 1.2 years of annually collected data. This included acculturation-related characteristics of total, language-, and social-based scores from the Short Acculturation Scale for Hispanics (SASH) and total and domain-specific scores from an abbreviated Sabogal Familism questionnaire. We used ordinal mixed effects models and linear mixed effects models (as appropriate) to assess change in acculturation metrics after adjusting for age, sex, education, income, and duration of time in the US/DC. Results: Although none of the SASH metrics changed over time (P-values >= 0.25), all Familism metrics declined over time (P-values <= 0.044). Additionally, select participant-based characteristics including years of education were significantly (and differentially) associated with level of, but not change in, acculturation-related outcomes. Discussion: Results suggest that specific acculturation-related factors (i.e., familism) change over time in older Latinos, and participant-based characteristics associated with baseline levels of (but not change in) acculturation more generally. Thus, acculturation-related characteristics are not all static, trait-like qualities but rather a multi-faceted, and at times evolving, construct. Considering this dynamic phenotyping is important when contextualizing older Latinos' lived experience, and when designing, adapting, and conducting ADRD clinical trials and other health-related interventions.
