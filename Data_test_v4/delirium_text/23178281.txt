23178281|t|Radiative-surface plasmon resonance for the detection of apolipoprotein E in medical diagnostics applications.
23178281|a|Surface plasmon resonance (SPR)-based sensors enable the rapid, label-free and highly sensitive detection of a large range of biomolecules. We have previously shown that, using silver-coated optical fibers with a high surface roughness, re-scattering of light from the surface plasmons is possible, turning SPR into a radiative process. The efficacy of this platform has proven for the detection of large biomolecules such as viruses, proteins and enzymes. Here, we demonstrate that by bringing together this novel emission-based fiber SPR platform with an improved surface functionalization process aimed at properly orienting the antibodies, it is possible to rapidly and specifically detect the regulation of human apolipoprotein E (apoE), a low-molecular-weight protein (~39 kDa) known to be involved in cardiovascular diseases, Alzheimer's disease and gastric cancer. The results obtained clearly show that this new sensing platform has the potential to serve as a tool for point-of-decision medical diagnostics. FROM THE CLINICAL EDITOR: In this study, a novel emission-based surface plasmon resonance platform using silver-coated optical fibers is described. Properly orienting antibodies on the surface enables rapid and specific detection of human apolipoprotein E (apoE).
