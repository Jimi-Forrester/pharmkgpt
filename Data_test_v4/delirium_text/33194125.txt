33194125|t|The cascade of benzodiazepine prescribing for hospitalized geriatric patients.
33194125|a|BACKGROUND: Hospitalists increasingly provide care for geriatric patients and little is known about the extent to which hospitalists adhere to evidence-based medication guidelines. This study aimed to characterize hospitalist adherence to BEERS guidelines for prescribing and monitoring benzodiazepines for older adults. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review of admitted patients aged 70-85 years who had been prescribed benzodiazepine. Charts from 351 patients were analyzed for documentation and decision rationale, which included 638 separate notes. RESULTS: Benzodiazepines were prescribed 28.2% of the time to address anxiety, which is inconsistent with the BEERS criteria; 39% had adequate data in the impression and plan section of the note to reflect why benzodiazepine was prescribed. Of note, the majority of notes had partial or missing data. CONCLUSION: Physicians tended to follow guidelines more than advance practice providers. Wide variation persists in prescribing practices and documentation related to benzodiazepines and both could potentially be addressed with further training.
