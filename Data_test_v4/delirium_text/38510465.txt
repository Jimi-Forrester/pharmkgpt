Although the detrimental effects of air pollution on respiratory and cardiovascular health are well-documented, its impact on neurological and cognitive disorders is an emerging area of concern. In this mini review, we explore the intricate mechanisms by which various air pollutants, such as particulate matter, nitrogen oxides, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, contribute to neurological pathologies. The focus lies on the role of oxidative stress and inflammation in exacerbating conditions like Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. By unraveling these connections, the paper sheds light on the broader implications of environmental factors on neurological health and underscores the urgent need for policy interventions to mitigate air pollution's impact on the nervous system.
