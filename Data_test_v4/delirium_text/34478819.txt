34478819|t|Mini-review: The suspected non-Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology.
34478819|a|Suspected non-Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology (SNAP) is a biomarker-based concept that underlying etiology has not been completely understood. Refers to a group of individuals that are negative for amyloid biomarkers and positive for p-Tau and/or neurodegeneration. SNAP causes great research interest because it is not clear if they have a different biological basis from Alzheimer's disease (AD), or are in an early stage of AD itself. The pathological processes behind SNAP need to be clarified. This mini-review aims to summarize the main characteristics of SNAP, besides reporting challenges and promising biomarkers related to the concept.
