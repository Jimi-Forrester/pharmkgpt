32357091|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the use of the aortic balloon occlusion technique to assist total aortic arch replacement (TAR) with frozen elephant trunk (FET) to shorten the lower body circulatory arrest (CA) time and raise the nadir temperature during cardiopulmonary bypass. METHODS: This retrospective study reviewed consecutive patients that underwent aortic balloon occlusion to assist TAR with FET and patients that received conventional TAR with FET procedures. Preoperative characteristics, perioperative characteristics and postoperative outcomes were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: The study included130 patients treated with aortic balloon occlusion and 230 patients treated with conventional TAR with FET. The 30-day mortality rate was similar between the aortic balloon occlusion and conventional groups (4.62% versus 7.83%, respectively). Multivariate analysis showed that aortic balloon occlusion reduced the incidence of acute kidney injury, hepatic injury and red blood cell transfusion. The application of aortic balloon occlusion reduced the mean +- SD CA time from 17.24 +- 4.36 min to 6.33 +- 5.74 min, with the target nadir nasal temperature being increased from 25 C to 28 C. CONCLUSION: The aortic balloon occlusion technique achieved significant improvements in reducing complications, but this did not translate into lower 30-day mortality.
