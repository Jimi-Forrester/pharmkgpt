10961425|t|Markers of apoptosis and models of programmed cell death in Alzheimer's disease.
10961425|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is neuropathologically marked by the presence of senile plaques composed of beta-amyloid peptide and by neurofibrillary tangles formed by abnormally phosphorylated tau protein. Many authors have also reported a neuronal loss in affected regions of the brain in AD patients. This neuronal degeneration could be linked to the triggering of intracellular pathways leading to apoptosis. Previous works were focused on the links between neuronal apoptosis and tau and amyloid precursor protein (APP) metabolisms. We have analyzed tau gene expression in primary neuronal cultures submitted to an apoptotic stress produced by excitotoxicity or serum deprivation. Glutamate induces an enhancement of tau gene expression in resistant neurons whereas a reduced expression is noted in apoptotic cells. This decrease is similar to what is observed after trophic support withdrawal in neuronal cultures. Neurons expressing phosphorylated tau are more resistant to experimental apoptosis than neurons positively labeled for dephosphorylated tau protein (AT8/Tau 1 epitope). In vitro apoptotic neurons are able to produce membrane blebbings (strongly immunopositive for APP and amyloidogenic fragments) that are secondary released in the extracellular space. Finally neurons overexpressing human mutated presenilin 1 (M146 L) are more prone to degenerate than neurons overexpressing human wild-type presenilin 1 after apoptosis induction.
