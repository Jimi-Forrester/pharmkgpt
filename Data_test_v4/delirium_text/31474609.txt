31474609|t|Exercise Physiologists: Key to Providing Early Mobilization in the Intensive Care Unit.
31474609|a|BACKGROUND: Patient immobility and a lack of physical activity in the intensive care unit results in a myriad of negative patient and hospital outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To report research findings related to the use of exercise physiologists in promoting and providing aggressive and progressive early mobilization within the intensive care unit. METHODS: This observational cohort study used the researcher-generated 12-point Activity Mobilization Evaluation Scale and delirium prevention bundle in 3 medical-surgical intensive care units to track patients' progress with mobilization. RESULTS: On average, most of the 216 patients in the study population realized a 1.6-point change (P < .001) in activity level with intervention by an exercise physiologist. Almost all of the study population (97%) maintained or increased the level of activity after receiving a minimum of 1 session with an exercise physiologist (mean, 3.5 sessions per day) during the 3-month study period. CONCLUSION: The introduction of exercise physiologists in the intensive care units proved to be a novel, safe, and effective strategy that maintained or increased the activity level of 97% of study patients.
