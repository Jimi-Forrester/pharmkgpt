33472580|a|Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) show homing capacity towards tumor sites. Numerous reports indicate that they are involved in multiple tumor-promoting processes through several mechanisms, including immunosuppression; stimulation of angiogenesis; transition to cancer-associated fibroblasts; inhibition of cancer cell apoptosis; induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT); and increase metastasis and chemoresistance. However, other studies have shown that MSCs suppress tumor growth by suppressing angiogenesis, incrementing inflammatory infiltration, apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, and inhibiting the AKT and Wnt signaling pathways. In this review, we discuss the supportive and suppressive impacts of MSCs on tumor progression and metastasis. We also discuss MSC-based therapeutic strategies for cancer based on their potential for homing to tumor sites.
