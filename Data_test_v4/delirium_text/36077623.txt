36077623|t|Adverse Renal Effects of Anticancer Immunotherapy: A Review.
36077623|a|Modern oncological therapy utilizes various types of immunotherapy. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-T) therapy, cancer vaccines, tumor-targeting monoclonal antibodies (TT-mAbs), bispecific antibodies and cytokine therapy improve patients' outcomes. However, stimulation of the immune system, beneficial in terms of fighting against cancer, generates the risk of harm to other cells in a patient's body. Kidney damage belongs to the relatively rare adverse events (AEs). Best described, but still, superficially, are renal AEs in patients treated with ICIs. International guidelines issued by the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) and the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) cover the management of immune-related adverse events (irAEs) during ICI therapy. There are fewer data concerning real occurrence and possible presentations of renal adverse drug reactions of other immunotherapeutic methods. This implies the need for the collection of safety data during ongoing clinical trials and in the real-life world to characterize the hazard related to the use of new immunotherapies and management of irAEs.
