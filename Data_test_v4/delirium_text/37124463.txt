37124463|t|Autoimmune Encephalitis Criteria in Clinical Practice.
37124463|a|Background and Objectives: To assess the clinical practice applicability of autoimmune encephalitis (AE) criteria (2016). Methods: Medical records of 538 adults diagnosed with AE or related autoimmune encephalopathy at Mayo Clinic (not including pure movement disorders) were reviewed and AE guideline criteria applied. Results: Of 538 patients, 288 were male (52%). The median symptom onset age was 55 years (range, 11-97 years; 16 had onset as children). All had other non-AE diagnoses reasonably excluded. Of 538 patients, 361 (67%) met at least possible criteria, having all 3 of subacute onset; memory deficits, altered mental status or psychiatric symptoms, and >=1 supportive feature (new focal objective CNS finding, N = 285; new-onset seizures, N = 283; supportive MRI findings, N = 251; or CSF pleocytosis, N = 160). Of 361 patients, AE subgroups were as follows: definite AE (N = 221, 61%, [87% AE-specific IgG positive]), probable seronegative AE (N = 18, 5%), Hashimoto encephalopathy (N = 20, 6%), or possible AE not otherwise categorizable (N = 102, 28%). The 221 patients with definite AE had limbic encephalitis (N = 127, 57%), anti-NMDA-R encephalitis (N = 32, 15%), ADEM (N = 8, 4%), or other AE-specific IgG defined (N = 54, 24%). The 3 most common definite AE-IgGs detected were as follows: LGI1 (76, 34%), NMDA-R (32, 16%), and high-titer GAD65 (23, 12%). The remaining 177 patients (33%) not meeting possible AE criteria had the following: seizures only (65, 12% of all 538 patients), brainstem encephalitis without supratentorial findings (55, 10%; none had Bickerstaff encephalitis), or other (57, 11%). Those 57 "others" lacked sufficient supportive clinical, radiologic, or CSF findings (N = 26), had insidious or initially episodic onset of otherwise typical disorders (N = 21), or had atypical syndromes without clearcut memory deficits, altered mental status, or psychiatric symptoms (N = 10). Fifteen of 57 were AE-specific IgG positive (26%). Among the remaining 42, evidence of other organ-specific autoimmunity (mostly thyroid) was encountered in 31 (74%, >=1 coexisting autoimmune disease [21, 50%] or >=1 non-AE-specific antibodies detected [23, 53%]), and all but 1 had an objective immunotherapy response (97%). Discussion: The 2016 AE guidelines permit autoimmune causation assessment in subacute encephalopathy and are highly specific. Inclusion could be improved by incorporating AE-IgG-positive patients with isolated seizures or brainstem disorders. Some patients with atypical presentations but with findings supportive of autoimmunity may be immune therapy responsive.
