37189726|t|Do Epilepsy Patients with Cognitive Impairment Have Alzheimer's Disease-like Brain Metabolism?
37189726|a|Although not classically considered together, there is emerging evidence that Alzheimer's disease (AD) and epilepsy share a number of features and that each disease predisposes patients to developing the other. Using machine learning, we have previously developed an automated fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) reading program (i.e., MAD), and demonstrated good sensitivity (84%) and specificity (95%) for differentiating AD patients versus healthy controls. In this retrospective chart review study, we investigated if epilepsy patients with/without mild cognitive symptoms also show AD-like metabolic patterns determined by the MAD algorithm. Scans from a total of 20 patients with epilepsy were included in this study. Because AD diagnoses are made late in life, only patients aged >=40 years were considered. For the cognitively impaired patients, four of six were identified as MAD+ (i.e., the FDG-PET image is classified as AD-like by the MAD algorithm), while none of the five cognitively normal patients was identified as MAD+ (chi2 = 8.148, p = 0.017). These results potentially suggest the usability of FDG-PET in prognosticating later dementia development in non-demented epilepsy patients, especially when combined with machine learning algorithms. A longitudinal follow-up study is warranted to assess the effectiveness of this approach.
