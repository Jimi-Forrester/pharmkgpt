39810446|a|Repurposing of drugs through nanocarriers (NCs) based platforms has been a recent trend in drug delivery research. Various routine drugs are now being repurposed to treat challenging neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer disease (AD). AD, at present is one of the challenging neurodegenerative disorders characterized by extracellular accumulation of amyloid-beta and intracellular accumulations of neurofibrillary tangles. In spite of catchy progress in drug development, effective treatment outcome in AD patients is far-fetched dream. Out of several proposed hypothesis in the development and progression of AD, potential role of microorganisms causing dementia and AD cannot be ruled out. Several recent researches have been documented a clear correlation in between microbial infection and neuronal damage leading to progression of AD. Thus, antimicrobial drugs repurposing has been emerged as alternate, potential, cost-effective strategy to check progression of AD. Further, for efficient delivery of antimicrobial drugs to brain tissue, novel NCs based platforms are the preferred option to bypass blood-brain barrier. Several polymeric and lipid NCs have been extensively studied over the past years to improve antimicrobial drug delivery to brain. The present review encompasses various repurposing strategy of antimicrobial drugs delivered through various NCs to target AD. Evidence-based research outcome compiled from authentic database like Scopus, PubMed, Web of science have been pooled to provide an updated review. Side by side some light has been thrown on the practical problems faced by nanodrug carriers during technology transfer.
