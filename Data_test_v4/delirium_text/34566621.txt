34566621|t|Total Cerebral Small Vessel Disease Burden on MRI Correlates With Medial Temporal Lobe Atrophy and Cognitive Performance in Patients of a Memory Clinic.
34566621|a|Background: Cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD) and neurodegeneration are the two main causes of dementia and are considered distinct pathological processes, while studies have shown overlaps and interactions between the two pathological pathways. Medial temporal atrophy (MTA) is considered a classic marker of neurodegeneration. We aimed to investigate the relationship of total cSVD burden and MTA on MRI using a total cSVD score and to explore the impact of the two MRI features on cognition. Methods: Patients in a memory clinic were enrolled, who underwent brain MRI scan and cognitive evaluation within 7 days after the first visit. MTA and total cSVD score were rated using validated visual scales. Cognitive function was assessed by using Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scales. Spearman's correlation and regression models were used to test (i) the association between MTA and total cSVD score as well as each cSVD marker and (ii) the correlation of the MRI features and cognitive status. Results: A total of 312 patients were finally enrolled, with a median age of 75.0 (66.0-80.0) years and 40.7% (127/312) males. All of them finished MRI and MMSE, and 293 subjects finished MoCA. Of note, 71.8% (224/312) of the patients had at least one of the cSVD markers, and 48.7% (152/312) of them had moderate-severe MTA. The total cSVD score was independently associated with MTA levels, after adjusting for age, gender, years of education, and other vascular risk factors (OR 1.191, 95% CI 1.071-1.324, P = 0.001). In regard to individual markers, a significant association existed only between white matter hyperintensities and MTA after adjusting for the factors mentioned above (OR 1.338, 95% CI 1.050-1.704, P = 0.018). Both MTA and total cSVD score were independent risk factors for MMSE <= 26 (MTA: OR 1.877, 95% CI 1.407-2.503, P < 0.001; total cSVD score: OR 1.474, 95% CI 1.132-1.921, P = 0.004), and MoCA < 26 (MTA: OR 1.629, 95% CI 1.112-2.388, P = 0.012; total cSVD score: OR 1.520, 95% CI 1.068-2.162, P = 0.020). Among all the cSVD markers, microbleed was found significantly associated with MMSE <= 26, while no marker was demonstrated a relationship with MoCA < 26. Conclusion: Cerebral small vessel disease was related to MTA in patients of a memory clinic, and both the MRI features had a significant association with cognitive impairment.
