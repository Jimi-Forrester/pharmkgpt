36616187|t|Bioassay Analysis and Molecular Docking Study Revealed the Potential Medicinal Activities of Active Compounds Polygonumins B, C and D from Polygonum minus (Persicaria minor).
36616187|a|Polygonumins B, C and D, derivative compounds of polygonumins A, were isolated from the stem of Polygonum minus. Based on NMR results, the structure of polygonumins derivatives is comprised of four phenylpropanoid units and a sucrose unit, with a similar structure to polygonumins A. However, the structural differences between polygonumins B (1), C (2) and D (3) can be distinguished based on the existence of methoxy, ethanoyl and hydroxyl groups and protons which bind to C-4, C-4' and C-3''. Interestingly, these bioactive compounds showed various medicinal properties based on our investigation on antioxidant, anticholinesterase and anti-HIV-1 protease activities. The IC50 value of DPPH and ABTS (antioxidant activities) was in the following descending order: polygonumins B > polygonumins C > polygonumins A > polygonumins D. In addition, almost similar pattern of antioxidant activity was observed for anti-acetylcholinesterase activity based on its IC50 value in descending order: polygonumins B > polygonumins C > polygonumins D > polygonumins A. On the other hand, polygonumins C and D showed inhibition of HIV-1 protease activity more than the positive control, pepstatin A. Finally, molecular docking studies on AChE and BChE proteins were carried out in order to gain insight into the mode of interactions between these compounds and the active residues for both enzymes. These remarkable findings indicate that these compounds have potential to be developed as targeted drugs for Alzheimer's disease or as anti-HIV drugs.
