24820014|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) might be conceptualized as a metabolic disease with progressive impairment of the brain's capacity to utilize glucose. One of the last glucose transporters discovered is GLUT12. The aim of the present work was to investigate the expression of GLUT12 in frontal cortex from AD patients. Human samples from young control donors barely expressed GLUT12. The level of expression of GLUT12 was significantly higher in AD compare to aged controls. Expression of GLUT12 and Ox-42, a microglia marker, correlate in controls but not in AD. The implications of these findings in AD are discussed further.
