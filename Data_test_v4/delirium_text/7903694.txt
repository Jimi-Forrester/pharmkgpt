7903694|t|A perspective on the management of delirium in terminally ill patients on a palliative care unit.
7903694|a|This article outlines the approach to the management of delirium developed by the staff of the palliative care unit at the Edmonton General Hospital. Delirium occurs commonly in the terminally ill and is associated with a poor prognosis. Management requires a clear understanding of what delirium is, how to assess it, investigations for reversible causes, and the medical treatments that are most useful. If not well managed, delirium can be a very distressing symptom for the patient and family as well as having a very destructive impact on the functioning of a palliative care unit.
