20641688|t|[<sup>123</sup>I]Iomazenil
20641688|a|[<sup>123</sup>I]Iomazenil ([<sup>123</sup>I]IMZ) is a ligand displaying high affinity for central-type benzodiazepine receptors, with high brain uptake and little nonspecific binding. It is a useful marker of neuronal viability. [<sup>123</sup>I]IMZ has been successfully used as a probe for single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in numerous clinical studies of diseases such Alzheimer s [PubMed], epilepsy [PubMed], or cerebral ischemia [PubMed], for which alterations of benzodiazepine receptors have been reported (1, 2).
