39879543|t|The Relationship between Removable Dental Prostheses and Brain Activity in Elderly Individuals: Systematic Review.
39879543|a|BACKGROUND: There is an increasing body of literature associating edentulism with cognitive impairment. The aim of this systematic review was to summarize the available data, emphasizing the role of removable dental prostheses in preventing cognitive deterioration and promoting brain health in elderly individuals. AIM: This systematic review investigates the relationship between the use of removable dental prostheses and physiological or adaptive changes at the cerebral level in partially and completely edentulous patients. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines, with an initial search across PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases. Studies published up to June 2023 in English were considered. A risk of bias assessment was performed for included studies. RESULTS: Of the 86 studies initially screened, 13 met the inclusion criteria. Findings indicate a positive association between the use of removable dental prostheses and improved cognitive function, with potential therapeutic implications for managing cognitive decline. CONCLUSION: Removable dental prostheses play a crucial role in enhancing neurological health and preventing cognitive decline, making them an important consideration in the management of neurodegenerative diseases.
