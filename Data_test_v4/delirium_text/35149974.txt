35149974|t|Factors Influencing Alzheimer's Disease Risk: Whether and How They are Related to the APOE Genotype.
35149974|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease featuring progressive cognitive impairment. Although the etiology of late-onset AD remains unclear, the close association of AD with apolipoprotein E (APOE), a gene that mainly regulates lipid metabolism, has been firmly established and may shed light on the exploration of AD pathogenesis and therapy. However, various confounding factors interfere with the APOE-related AD risk, raising questions about our comprehension of the clinical findings concerning APOE. In this review, we summarize the most debated factors interacting with the APOE genotype and AD pathogenesis, depict the extent to which these factors relate to APOE-dependent AD risk, and discuss the possible underlying mechanisms.
