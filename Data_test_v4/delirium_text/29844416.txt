29844416|t|Role of TREM-1 in pulmonary tuberculosis patients- analysis of serum soluble TREM-1 levels.
29844416|a|Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1 (TREM-1) amplifies inflammatory responses and is upregulated during sepsis and pulmonary infection. The association between serum soluble TREM-1 (sTREM-1) level and pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) disease deserves investigation. In the present study, patients with PTB, latent TB infection (LTBI), and non-TB, non-LTBI subjects were prospectively enrolled and serum levels of sTREM-1, sTREM-2, and C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured. We correlated serum biomarkers and clinical presentations and treatment outcomes of PTB cases. We also utilized immunohistochemistry (IHC) to visualize TREM-1-expressing cells in lung tissues from PTB patients. A total of 86 PTB, 41 LTBI, and 20 non-TB, non-LTBI subjects were enrolled. Serum levels of sTREM-1 and CRP significantly increased in PTB patients; these higher serum levels were correlated with more advanced involvement in chest films and higher bacteria burden in sputum. In multivariate analysis, serum levels of sTREM-1 >260 pg/mL and CRP >2.6 mg/L were independent predictors for on-treatment mortality. Abundant TREM-1-expressing macrophages were identified in lung tissues from PTB samples. In conclusion, serum levels of sTREM-1 correlated with disease severity and treatment outcomes in PTB patients.
