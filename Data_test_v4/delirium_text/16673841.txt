16673841|a|OBJECTIVE: Coprophagia or the ingestion of feces has long been associated with psychiatric illness. It is considered to be a variant of pica. This behavior requires an extensive medical and psychiatric differential diagnosis. Medical disorders associated with coprophagia include seizure disorders, cerebral atrophy, and tumors. Psychiatric disorders associated with coprophagia include mental retardation, alcoholism, depression, obsessive compulsive disorder, schizophrenia, fetishes, delirium, and dementia. In animals, coprophagia is associated with boredom, thiamine deficiency, and lesions of the amygdala. METHODS: A case of coprophagia in an elderly man is reported here. A 77-year-old man with mild mental retardation was referred for urgent psychiatric evaluation due to coprophagia. The case is discussed and the literature reviewed. RESULTS: Psychiatric evaluation revealed cognitive dysfunction and depression. Physical examination and laboratory evaluation were noncontributory. He was started on sertraline 25 mg daily with resolution of his coprophagia. Coprophagia has been treated using behavioral interventions, supportive psychotherapy, elemental diets, tricyclic anti-depressants, carbamazepine, haloperidol, and electroconvulsive therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Use of Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) may also be an effective treatment for coprophagia, particularly in the setting of depression or anxiety.
