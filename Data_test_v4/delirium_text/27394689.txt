27394689|t|Retinal nerve fibre layer thickness changes in Alzheimer's disease: Results from a 12-month prospective case series.
27394689|a|PURPOSE: To compare the 12-month peripapillary retinal nerve fibre layer (pRNFL) thickness change between AD patients and normal subjects. METHODS: In this prospective case series, thirty-six patients with a diagnosis of mild to moderate AD and 36 age-matched control subjects were included. All the subjects underwent neuropsychological (MMSE, ADAS-Cog and CDR) and ophthalmological evaluation, including spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), at baseline and after 12 months. RESULTS: Compared with controls, AD patients had a significant reduction of the total pRNFL thickness, as well as the pRNFL thickness of the inferior and superior quadrants (p=0.04, p=0.001, and p=0.01, respectively, adjusted for baseline pRNFL measurement, age, gender, and axial length). Correlation analysis showed a significant relationship between inferior pRNFL thickness change and ADAS-Cog scores change (r=-0.35, p=0.02) as well as CDR scores at 12 months (r=-0.39, p=0.008). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with controls, AD patients had a significant reduction in pRNFL thickness over a period of 12 months. The pRNFL reduction was more prominent in the inferior quadrant and paralleled patient's cognitive decline.
