35068454|t|Association Between Plasma L-Carnitine and Cognitive Impairment in Patients with Acute Ischemic Stroke.
35068454|a|BACKGROUND: L-carnitine has been shown to exert neuroprotective effects on cerebral ischemia, mainly by improving mitochondrial function and reducing inflammation. L-carnitine supplementation has also been promoted to enhance cognitive function. However, the relationship between L-carnitine and cognitive impairment after ischemic stroke has seldom been studied. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate the association between plasma L-carnitine and poststroke cognitive impairment. METHODS: The study sample population was drawn from the China Antihypertensive Trial in Acute Ischemic Stroke. Plasma L-carnitine were measured at baseline in 617 patients with ischemic stroke using ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Cognitive function was evaluated using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment at 3-month follow-up after ischemic stroke. RESULTS: Plasma L-carnitine were inversely associated with cognitive impairment at 3 months after ischemic stroke, and the adjusted odds ratio (95% CI) for the highest versus lowest quartiles of L-carnitine was 0.60 (0.37, 0.98; p for trend = 0.04). Each 1-SD increase in log-transformed L-carnitine concentration was significantly associated with a 15% (95% CI: 1%, 29%) reduction in the risk of cognitive impairment after stroke. The addition of L-carnitine to the model including conventional risk factors significantly improved the risk reclassification for cognitive impairment (net reclassification improvement: 17.9%, integrated discrimination improvement: 0.8%; both p < 0.05). Furthermore, joint effects of L-carnitine and inflammation markers were observed, and patients with higher L-carnitine and a lower inflammatory status simultaneously had the lowest risk of poststroke cognitive impairment. CONCLUSION: The present study provided prospective evidence on the inverse association between plasma L-carnitine and cognitive impairment after ischemic stroke.
