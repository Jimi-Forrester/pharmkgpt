33894924|a|Consent must be sought by the doctor and caregivers on the basis of clinical insight. The argumentation must be coherent and well thought out, in order to facilitate the patient's choice. The question of consent is more important in psychiatry because of the different pathologies. The example of schizophrenia with the expression of delirium, hallucinations or disorganization reflects the difficulties encountered in the search for consent. This can then be apprehended as a therapeutic tool promoting meeting and trust.
