39857634|t|Exploring the Molecular Modalities in the Pathogenesis of Diabetic Kidney Disease with a Focus on the Potential Therapeutic Implications.
39857634|a|Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is a leading cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease worldwide, affecting approximately 40% of individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and 30% of those with type 1 diabetes (T1DM). As the prevalence of diabetes continues to rise, the burden of DKD is expected to grow correspondingly. This review explores the roles of key molecular pathways, including the apelinergic system, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/VEGF receptor (VEGFR) axis, and nitric oxide (NO)/nitric oxide synthase (NOS) signaling, in DKD pathogenesis and potential therapeutic applications. The apelinergic system, involving apelin and its receptor (APLNR), influences endothelial function, glucose metabolism, and renal health. Preclinical studies highlight its dual role in renal protection and injury through anti-inflammatory and antioxidant pathways, while other evidence suggests that it may exacerbate DKD through podocyte damage and angiogenesis. Similarly, the VEGF/VEGFR axis demonstrates a complex contribution to DKD, where VEGF-A promotes pathological angiogenesis and glomerular damage, but its inhibition requires careful modulation to prevent adverse effects. The NO/NOS system, integral to vascular and renal homeostasis, also exhibits altered activity in DKD, with reduced bioavailability linked to oxidative stress and inflammation. This review underscores the intricate interplay between these pathways in DKD, revealing both challenges and opportunities in their therapeutic targeting. Further research is essential to refine strategies and develop effective interventions for DKD management.
