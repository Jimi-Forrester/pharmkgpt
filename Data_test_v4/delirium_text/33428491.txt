33428491|t|Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease - a patent review (2016-present).
33428491|a|Introduction - AD, the most common form of dementia, has a multifactorial etiology, and the current therapy (AChEIs and memantine) is unable to interrupt its progress and fatal outcome. This is reflected in the research programs that are oriented toward the development of new therapeutics able to operate on multiple targets involved in the disease progression.Areas covered - The patents from 2016 to present regarding the use of AChEIs in AD, concerns the development of new AChEIs, multitarget or multifunctional ligands, or the associations of currently used AChEIs with other compounds acting on different targets involved in the AD.Expert opinion - The development of new multitarget AChEIs promises to identify compounds with great therapeutic potential but requires more time and effort in order to obtain drugs with the optimal pharmacodynamic profile. Otherwise, the research on new combinations of existing drugs, with known pharmacodynamic and ADME profile, could shorten the time and reduce the costs to develop a new therapeutic treatment for AD. From the analyzed data, it seems more likely that a response to the urgent need to develop effective treatments for AD therapy could come more quickly from studies on drug combinations than from the development of new AChEIs.
