31453122|a|Effects of ethanolic extracts of leaf, seed and fruit of Datura metel on kidney function of male albino rats was investigated in this study. The result showed a non-significant (p > 0.05) increase of urea concentration in groups 2 and 3 administered low (300 mg/kg bw) and high (600 mg/kg bw) dose of leaf extract respectively and a non-significant (p > 0.05) decrease in all groups administered the seed and fruit extracts compared with normal control (group 1). Creatinine increased significantly (p < 0.05) in groups 4 and 7 administered low dose (300 mg/kg bw) of seed extract and high dose (600 mg/kg bw) of fruit extract respectively, but increased non-significantly in other groups (2, 3, 5 & 6) compared with normal control. Sodium, potassium and bicarbonate concentrations increased non-significantly (p > 0.05) in all groups administered the various extracts, except in group 4 in which sodium reduced non-significantly (p > 0.05) compared with normal control. Chloride increased significantly (p < 0.05) in group 5 and non-significantly (p > 0.05) in groups 3, 6 and 7, but reduced non-significantly (p > 0.05) in group 4 compared with normal control. The administration of some of the extracts in comparison with the normal control in histology of the animals show glomerular extrusion and glomerular collapse with resultant increased urinary space, dilated tubules, vacuolations in some epithelial lining of most of the tubules in the medulla and inflammatory cellular infiltration at some peritubular regions. The results showed that some parts of Datura metel posed mild negative effects, while some parts could possess nephroprotective potential by regulating the kidney function of male albino rats.
