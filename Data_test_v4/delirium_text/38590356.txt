38590356|a|Acute liver failure caused by hepatic ischemia reperfusion injury (HIRI) poses a severe threat to life, emphasizing the urgent need for precise and timely early diagnosis. Viscosity, a key parameter reflecting active analyte levels at the cellular level, remains underexplored in relation to HIRI. To address this gap, we have developed a groundbreaking near-infrared molecule rotator, PN, exhibiting exceptional characteristics. PN demonstrates remarkable sensitivity, with a 32-fold change in response to viscosity, ranging from PBS to glycerol solution. PN's distinctive features include maximum emission wavelength 790 nm, as well as an impressive Stokes shift 190 nm. Moreover, PN exhibits the ability to sensitively and selectively differentiate nystatin-induced viscosity changes within living cells, and can be used for the detection of viscosity changes in the HIRI mouse model. This capability enhances our understanding of cellular responses, opening avenues for potential applications within disease models. The versatility of PN extends to its potential role in guiding timely monitoring and imaging of viscosity, offering valuable insights into disease progression.
