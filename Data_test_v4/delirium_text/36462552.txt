36462552|t|Predictors of dementia amongst newly diagnosed non-valvular atrial fibrillation patients.
36462552|a|Atrial fibrillation (AF) confers a 2-to-3-fold increased risk of developing cognitive dysfunction and dementia, independent of age and past stroke. The purpose of study was to identify risk factors for developing dementia amongst AF patients in India. This was a single-centre, prospective, observational study wherein recently diagnosed, treatment naive, persistent non-valvular AF patients were enrolled. All patients were screened for dementia using the Mini-Mental state exam. Amongst a total of 108 patients enrolled, 40 (37%) had dementia. The most common cognitive deficits were in attention and calculation followed by memory deficits. Factors independently contributing to dementia were advanced age, female sex, presence of diabetes, elevated pulmonary artery pressures and a lower serum albumin.
