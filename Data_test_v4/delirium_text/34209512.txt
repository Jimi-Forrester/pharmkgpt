34209512|t|The Association between Tau Protein Level in Cerebrospinal Fluid and Cognitive Status: A Large-Scale Analysis of GAAIN Database.
34209512|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the associated neurodegenerative dementia have become of increasing concern in healthcare. The tau protein has been considered a key hallmark of progressive neurodegeneration. In this paper, a large-scale analysis of five datasets (more than 2500 people) from the Global Alzheimer's Association Interactive Network (GAAIN) databases was performed to investigate the association between the level of tau protein, including total tau and phosphorylated tau (p-tau), in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and cognitive status. Statistically significant (or marginally significant) high total tau or p-tau concentrations in CSF were observed in dementia patients compared with healthy people in all datasets. There is also a statistically significant (or marginally significant) negative correlation between p-tau concentrations in CSF and Folstein Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores. In addition, transcriptomic data derived from mouse microglial cells showed multiple genes upregulated in Toll-like receptor signaling and Alzheimer's disease pathways, including TNF, TLR2, IL-1beta, and COX subunits, suggesting that the mechanism of action that relates p-tau and MMSE scores may be through overactivation of pro-inflammatory microglial activity by Abeta peptides, TNF-mediated hyperphosphorylation of tau, and the infectious spread of pathological tau across healthy neurons. Our results not only confirmed the association between tau protein level and cognitive status in a large population but also provided useful information for the understanding of the role of tau in neurodegeneration and the development of dementia.
