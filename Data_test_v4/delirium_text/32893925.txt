New inflammatory indices derived from full cell blood count may be associated with increased risk of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) caused by CCAD. The goal of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic performances of neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and lymphocyte to monocyte ratio (LMR) in CCAD. METHOD: We retrospectively analyzed 52 patients with AIS caused by CCAD from emergency room (group I), 51 patients with CCAD from emergency room or clinic(group II) and 52 controls (group III), age and sex matched. Data were collected on the admission including NLR and LMR. RESULTS: Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio and LMR have significant differences among three groups, especially in group I vs both groups II and III (P < .001). There was a negative correlation between admission NLR and LMR. Low LMR level and high NLR level may be associated with severity of AIS caused by CCAD and significantly predict AIS in CCAD. The area under the curve of NLR and LMR were 0.77 and 0.71, respectively, on receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. The optimal cutoff values of NLR and LMR that best discriminated AIS were 2.35 (81% sensitivity and 63% specificity) and 3.67 (64% sensitivity and 77% specificity). CONCLUSIONS: Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio and LMR may contribute to the diagnostic evaluation and prompt immediate therapy in patients with CCAD.
