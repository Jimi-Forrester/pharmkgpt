38096525|t|TRAUMATIC PULMONARY HERNIATION: A RARE CHEST TRAUMA MANIFESTATION.
38096525|a|Traumatic pulmonary hernia is an uncommon occurrence resulting from chest trauma, typically covered by the skin. Chest trauma may arise from penetrating or blunt mechanisms, with blunt trauma being more frequently observed. When lung herniation transpires, various symptoms such as chest pain, dyspnea, subcutaneous emphysema, bone crepitation, and hemoptysis (in cases of lung parenchymal damage) may manifest. We present the case of a 66-year-old woman suffering from chest pain and dyspnea after blunt chest trauma due to a fall induced by delirium following alcohol abuse.
