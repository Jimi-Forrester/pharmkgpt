38344035|a|Aggregates of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides are thought to cause Alzheimer's disease. Polyphenolic compounds are known to inhibit Abeta aggregation. We applied replica permutation with solute tempering (RPST) to the system of Abeta fragments, Abeta(16-22), and polyphenols to elucidate the mechanism of inhibition of Abeta aggregation. The RPST molecular dynamics simulations were performed for two polyphenols, myricetin (MYC) and rosmarinic acid (ROA). Two Abeta fragments were distant, and the number of residues forming the intermolecular beta-sheet was reduced in the presence of MYC and ROA compared with that in the absence of polyphenols. MYC was found to interact with glutamic acid and phenylalanine of Abeta fragments. These interactions induce helix structure formation of Abeta fragments, making it difficult to form beta-sheet. ROA interacted with glutamic acid and lysine, which reduced the hydrophilic interaction between Abeta fragments. These results indicate that these polyphenols inhibit the aggregation of Abeta fragments with different mechanisms.
