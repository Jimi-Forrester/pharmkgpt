32565452|t|Study design and baseline characteristics of Shenzhen ageing-related disorder cohort in China.
32565452|a|PURPOSE: The Shenzhen ageing-related disorder cohort was designed to detect the associations of lifestyle, environmental and genetic factors with major ageing-related disorders, especially neurological and mental disorders. PARTICIPANTS: The cohort was a community-dwelling prospective study of 9411 elderly adults aged 60 to 92 years from 51 community health service centres in Luohu district of Shenzhen, China. The baseline data were collected between 2017 and 2018, including demographics and socioeconomics, lifestyles, medical history, family history of major non-communicable chronic disease, environmental exposures, clinical analysis of blood and urine, clinical imaging measurements, anthropometric measures and neurological function and mental health assessments. Blood and urinary samples were collected at baseline. All participants will be followed for physiological and psychological disorders and updated lifestyle and environmental exposures every 5 years. FINDINGS TO DATE: The mean age of the participants was 67.73 years at baseline, and 42.74% were males. The prevalences of individuals with unhealthy conditions were as follows: overweight/obesity (54.38%), hypertension (58.24%), diabetes mellitus (22.30%), dyslipidaemia (75.69%), chronic bronchitis (1.45%), myocardial infarction (0.55%), coronary heart disease (5.69%), stroke (1.10%), cancer (2.18%), arthritis (5.04%), Alzheimer's disease (0.18%), Parkinson's disease (0.23%), brain injury (5.75%), cognitive impairment (5.39%) and depression status (3.28%). The mean scores for the Lawton-Brody Activities of Daily Living Scale and the Social Support Rate Scale were 14.15 and 39.54, respectively. FUTURE PLANS: 2000 new entrants from Luohu district will be recruited every year until 2028. The data collection is expected to be ended at the end of 2030. The data will be used to assess the causality of ageing-related disorders, especially neurological and mental disorders through integrating environmental, genetic and lifestyle factors. The data sets generated and/or analysed during the current study are not publicly available at this stage, but are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.
