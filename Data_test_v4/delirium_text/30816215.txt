30816215|t|Optic disc cupping characteristics of normal pressure hydrocephalus patients with normal-tension glaucoma.
30816215|a|We examined the potential association of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) with the generation of normal-tension glaucoma (NTG), to explore possible relationships between intracranial pressure (ICP) and the presence of glaucoma, and to compare disc morphology of NTG patients with or without iNPH. We investigated 20 iNPH patients, examined the prevalence of glaucoma, and compared the optic discs of NTG patients with iNPH (n = 11) and age-matched NTG patients without iNPH (n = 16). All data were collected prior to the treatment of iNPH, to eliminate the possibility that the treatment may have contributed to the progression of NTG. The diagnoses of NTG were made using visual field data, intraocular pressure measurements, fundoscopy, and optical coherence tomography (OCT). Using OCT, the optic nerve disc depth was also measured. The ICP was higher in the iNPH with NTG compared to iNPH without NTG (p = 0.0425), and the cupping depths of the discs of NTG patients with iNPH were significantly shallower compared with those of NTG patients without iNPH (p = 0.0097). Based on the difference in cupping depth, NTG patients with iNPH may have a different morphology from typical glaucoma patients, which could in turn reflect a different pathogenesis compared to NTG patients without iNPH.
