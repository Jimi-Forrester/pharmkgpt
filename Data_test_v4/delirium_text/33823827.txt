33823827|a|BACKGROUND: With the population aging worldwide, adult degenerative scoliosis (ADS) is receiving increased attention. Frailty, instead of chronological age, is used for assessing the patient's overall physical condition. In ADS patients undergoing a posterior approach, long-segment corrective surgery, the association of frailty with the postsurgical outcomes remains undefined. METHODS: ADS patients who underwent a posterior approach, long-segment fusion at the Department of Orthopedics, Beijing Chaoyang Hospital, Capital Medical University (CMU), Beijing, China, in 2014-2017 were divided into the frailty and non-frailty groups according to the modified frailty index. Major postoperative complications were recorded, including cardiac complications, pneumonia, acute renal dysfunction, delirium, stroke, neurological deficit, deep wound infection, gastrointestinal adverse events, and deep vein thrombosis. Radiographic measurements and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) parameters were recorded preoperatively and at 2 postoperative years. RESULTS: A total of 161 patients were included: 47 (29.2%) and 114 (70.8%) in the frailty and non-frailty groups, respectively. Major postoperative complications were more frequent in the frailty group than the non-frailty group (29.8% vs. 10.5%, P = 0.002). Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that frailty was independently associated with major complications (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 2.77, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.12-6.89, P = 0.028). Radiographic and HRQOL parameters were improved at 2 years but with no significant between-group differences. CONCLUSIONS: Frailty is a risk factor for postoperative complications in ADS after posterior single approach, long-segment corrective surgery. Frailty screening should be applied preoperatively in all patients to optimize the surgical conditions in ADS.
