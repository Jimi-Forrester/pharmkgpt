38228092|t|Early Mobilization and Rehabilitation of Critically-Ill Patients.
38228092|a|>Post-intensive care unit (ICU) syndrome may occur after ICU treatment and includes ICU-acquired weakness (ICU-AW), cognitive decline, and mental problems. ICU-AW is muscle weakness in patients treated in the ICU and is affected by the period of mechanical ventilation. Diaphragmatic weakness may also occur because of respiratory muscle unloading using mechanical ventilators. ICU-AW is an independent predictor of mortality and is associated with longer duration of mechanical ventilation and hospital stay. Diaphragm weakness is also associated with poor outcomes. Therefore, pulmonary rehabilitation with early mobilization and respiratory muscle training is necessary in the ICU after appropriate patient screening and evaluation and can improve ICU-related muscle weakness and functional deterioration.
