38397046|t|Innovative Insights into Traumatic Brain Injuries: Biomarkers and New Pharmacological Targets.
38397046|a|A traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major health issue affecting many people across the world, causing significant morbidity and mortality. TBIs often have long-lasting effects, disrupting daily life and functionality. They cause two types of damage to the brain: primary and secondary. Secondary damage is particularly critical as it involves complex processes unfolding after the initial injury. These processes can lead to cell damage and death in the brain. Understanding how these processes damage the brain is crucial for finding new treatments. This review examines a wide range of literature from 2021 to 2023, focusing on biomarkers and molecular mechanisms in TBIs to pinpoint therapeutic advancements. Baseline levels of biomarkers, including neurofilament light chain (NF-L), ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase-L1 (UCH-L1), Tau, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in TBI, have demonstrated prognostic value for cognitive outcomes, laying the groundwork for personalized treatment strategies. In terms of pharmacological progress, the most promising approaches currently target neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptotic mechanisms. Agents that can modulate these pathways offer the potential to reduce a TBI's impact and aid in neurological rehabilitation. Future research is poised to refine these therapeutic approaches, potentially revolutionizing TBI treatment.
