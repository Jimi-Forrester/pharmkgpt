38306036|t|The Relationship Between Fermented Dairy Consumption with Cognitive Function Among Older US Adults: Data from the NHANES 2011-2014.
38306036|a|Background: The aging global population has led to an increased burden of cognitive impairment in older adults. Objective: This study examined the relationship between fermented dairy intake and cognitive function in this population. Methods: Yogurt, cheese, and fermented dairy consumption were assessed through two 24-hour dietary recall interviews, categorized into low, medium, and high intake groups. Multivariate linear regression was employed to examine the relationship between fermented dairy intake and cognitive tests, including the Alzheimer's Disease Word Learning Immediate Recall Test (CERAD-IRT), CERAD Delayed Recall Test (CERAD-DRT), Animal Fluency Test (AFT), Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST), and global cognitive z-scores, adjusting for potential confounding factors. Results: The study comprised 2,462 participants (average age 69.34+-6.75 years, 52.07% female). Among yogurt consumers, global cognition and AFT z-scores are notably higher than non-consumers. Conversely, individuals who consume cheese display significantly lower CERAD-DRT z-scores. Compared to participants not intake fermented dairy, consumers of fermented dairy show significantly higher AFT and DSST z-scores and lower CERAD-DRT z-scores. Moreover, when categorizing individuals based on their intake of fermented dairy, those with low and medium consumption show significantly higher AFT and DSST z-scores, as well as significantly lower CERAD-DRT z-scores compared to non-consumers. Conclusions: Our study suggests that moderate consumption of fermented dairy products is associated with better executive function and verbal fluency in the elderly.
