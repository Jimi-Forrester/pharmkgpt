34357102|a|Identification of potential pathological biomarkers has proved to be essential for understanding complex and fatal diseases, such as cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. Ion channels are involved in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. Moreover, loss of function and aberrant expression of ion channels and transporters have been linked to various cancers, and to neurodegeneration. The Chloride Intracellular Channel 1 (CLIC1), CLIC1 is a metamorphic protein belonging to a partially unexplored protein superfamily, the CLICs. In homeostatic conditions, CLIC1 protein is expressed in cells as a cytosolic monomer. In pathological states, CLIC1 is specifically expressed as transmembrane chloride channel. In the following review, we trace the involvement of CLIC1 protein functions in physiological and in pathological conditions and assess its functionally active isoform as a potential target for future therapeutic strategies.
