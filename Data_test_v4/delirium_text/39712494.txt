39712494|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major neurodegenerative disorder that courses with chronic neuroinflammation. Pleiotrophin (PTN) is an endogenous inhibitor of Receptor Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase (RPTP) beta/zeta which is upregulated in different neuroinflammatory disorders of diverse origin, including AD. To investigate the role of RPTPbeta/zeta in neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, we used eight-to ten-month-old APP/PS1 AD mouse model. They were administered intragastrically with MY10, an inhibitor of RPTPbeta/zeta, at different doses (60 and 90 mg/kg) every day for 14 days. Treatment with 90 mg/kg MY10 significantly reduced the number and size of amyloid beta (Abeta) plaques in the dorsal subiculum of the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice. In addition, we observed a significant decrease in the number and size of astrocytes in both sexes and in the number of microglial cells in a sex-dependent manner. This suggests that RPTPbeta/zeta plays an important role in modulating Abeta plaque formation and influences glial responses, which may contribute to improved Abeta clearance. In addition, MY10 treatment decreased the interaction of glial cells with Abeta plaques in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice. Furthermore, the analysis of proinflammatory markers in the hippocampus revealed that MY10 treatment decreased the mRNA levels of Tnfa and Hmgb1. Notably, treatment with MY10 increased Bace1 mRNA expression, which could be involved in enhancing Abeta degradation, and it decreased Mmp9 levels, which might reflect changes in the neuroinflammatory environment and impact Abeta plaque dynamics. These results support the therapeutic potential of inhibition of RPTPbeta/zeta in modulating Abeta pathology and neuroinflammation in AD.
