38772221|a|BACKGROUND: The recently discovered glymphatic system may support the removal of neurotoxic proteins, mainly during sleep, that are associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Disease. Diffusion tensor image analysis along the perivascular space (DTI-ALPS) has been suggested as a method to index the health of glymphatic system (with higher values indicating a more intact glymphatic system). Indeed, in small-scale studies the DTI-ALPS index has been shown to correlate with age, cognitive health, and sleep, and is higher in females than males. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether these relationships are stable we replicated previous findings associating the DTI-ALPS index with demographic, sleep-related, and cognitive markers in a large sample of participants from the UK Biobank. METHODS: We calculated the DTI-ALPS index in UK Biobank participants (n = 17723). Using Bayesian and Frequentist analysis approaches, we replicate previously reported relationships between the DTI-ALPS index. RESULTS: We found the predicted associations between the DTI-ALPS index and age, longest uninterrupted sleep window (LUSWT) on a typical night, cognitive performance, and sex. However, these effects were substantially smaller than those found in previous studies. Parameter estimates from this study may be used as priors in subsequent studies using a Bayesian approach. These results suggest that the DTI-ALPS index is consistently, and therefore predictably, associated with demographics, LUWST, and cognition. CONCLUSION: We propose that the metric, calculated for the first time in a large-scale, population-based cohort, is a stable measure, but one for which stronger links to glymphatic system function are needed before it can be used to understand the relationships between glymphatic system function and health outcomes reported in the UK Biobank.
