10076867|a|To clarify the effects of the proteolytic cleavage of presenilin 1 (PS1) and presenilin 2 (PS2) proteins on their functions, we established stable cell lines which expressed the physiologically cleaved N-terminal fragment (NTF) with or without mutations of familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD). We found that exogenous expression of the PS1-NTF or PS2-NTF harboring FAD mutations was insufficient for increased production of amyloidogenic A beta X-42 peptide and that the overexpressed NTFs had no effect on the accumulation of endogenous presenilin fragments.
