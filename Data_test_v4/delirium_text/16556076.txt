16556076|t|Targeting GSK-3: a promising approach for cancer therapy?
16556076|a|Glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3 has emerged as one of the most attractive therapeutic targets for the treatment of multiple neurological diseases, including Alzheimer's, stroke and bipolar disorders, as well as noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and inflammation. Although the prominent role of GSK-3 in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC)-beta-catenin destruction complex implies that inhibition of GSK-3 could possibly lead to tumor promotion through the activation of beta-catenin, several recent studies have shed new light on the activity of GSK-3 in cancer and provide insight into the molecular mechanisms by which it regulates tumor cell proliferation and survival of multiple human malignancies. In fact, GSK-3beta is a critical regulator of nuclear factor (NF)kappaB nuclear activity, suggesting that inhibition of GSK-3beta could be effective in the treatment of a wide variety of tumors with constitutively active NFkappaB. Herein, the authors will discuss the current understanding of the role of GSK-3 in human cancer and its potential as a therapeutic target.
