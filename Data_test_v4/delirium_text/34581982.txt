34581982|a|INTRODUCTION: Tapentadol has analgesic effects comparable to those of conventional opioids and is associated with fewer side effects, including gastrointestinal symptoms, drowsiness, and dizziness, than other opioids. However, the safety of tapentadol in the Japanese population remains unclear; the present multicentre study aimed to examine the safety of tapentadol and the characteristics of patients likely to discontinue this treatment owing to adverse events. METHODS: The safety of tapentadol was assessed retrospectively in patients with any type of cancer treated between August 18, 2014 and October 31, 2019 across nine institutions in Japan. Patients were examined at baseline and at the time of opioid discontinuation. Multivariate analysis was performed to identify factors associated with tapentadol discontinuation owing to adverse events. RESULTS: A total of 906 patients were included in this study, and 685 (75.6%) cases were followed up until tapentadol cessation for any reason. Among patients who discontinued treatment, 119 (17.4%) did so because of adverse events. Among adverse events associated with difficulty in taking medication, nausea was the most common cause of treatment discontinuation (4.7%), followed by drowsiness (1.8%). Multivariate analysis showed that those who were prescribed tapentadol by a palliative care physician (odds ratio [OR] 2.60, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.36-4.99, p = 0.004), patients switching to tapentadol due to side effects from previous opioids (OR 2.19, 95% CI 1.05-4.56, p = 0.037), and patients who did not use naldemedine (OR 5.06, 95% CI 2.47-10.37, p < 0.0001) had an increased risk of treatment discontinuation owing to adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: This study presents the safety profile of tapentadol and the characteristics of patients likely to discontinue this treatment owing to adverse events in the Japanese population. Prospective controlled trials are required to evaluate the safety of tapentadol and validate the present findings.
