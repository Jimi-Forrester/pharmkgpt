25178721|t|Sulforaphane interaction with amyloid beta 1-40 peptide studied by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry.
25178721|a|RATIONALE: Aggregation of amyloid beta 1-40 (Abeta) in the brain causes Alzheimer's disease (AD) and several small molecules are known to inhibit the aggregation process. Sulforaphane (SFN) is a natural isothiocyanate which is known to prevent various neurodegenerative processes. However, its interaction with Abeta is yet to be explored. Such studies could provide new mechanistic insights for its neuroprotective properties. METHODS: Liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LC/ESI-MS) and in-source fragmentation experiments were performed on an Orbitrap mass spectrometer. The solution of Abeta and SFN was incubated and analyzed by mass spectrometry. Isotopic distribution patterns, accurate mass values and theoretical product ions were used to analyze the mass spectrometry data. The nature of binding of SFN and its binding sites with Abeta were evaluated by LC/MS and trypsin digestion experiments. RESULTS: ESI-MS analysis of the incubated solution of Abeta and SFN showed a 1:1 complex of [Abeta+SFN]. LC/MS analysis revealed that the solution contains three different [Abeta+SFN] complexes due to covalent binding of SFN to Abeta at three different sites. The in-source fragmentation experiments revealed that SFN is binding to free NH(2) groups (N-terminal amino acid and lysines) in Abeta. Trypsin digestion experiments further confirmed the SFN binding sites in Abeta. CONCLUSIONS: The interaction of SFN, an anticancer agent, with Abeta was studied using ESI-MS. SFN is found to bind covalently and specifically with the free NH(2) group of N-terminal aspartic acid and the epsilon-amino group of lysine at positions 16 and 28. Aggregation assay studies showed a lesser inclination of Abeta to aggregate when SFN is present. Hence the present study helps in understanding the mechanism of the action of SFN on the Abeta peptide.
