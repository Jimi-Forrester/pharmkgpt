36163604|t|The Association Between Objectively-Measured Physical Activity and Cognitive Functioning in Middle-Aged and Older People Living with HIV.
36163604|a|Middle-aged and older people living with HIV (PWH) are at higher risk for cognitive impairment and engage in lower levels of physical activity (PA) than seronegative counterparts. Research examining the association between objectively-measured PA and cognitive function in this population is scarce. This cross-sectional study examined the association between accelerometry-measured PA and cognitive functioning among 75 PWH (mean age 55.63). Light PA was the PA variable with the most consistent associations with cognition, with more minutes per week of light PA (performed in bouts of >= 10 min) being associated with better executive function, working memory/attention, and speed of processing performance, adjusted for age and current CD4 count. Findings suggest that although middle-aged and older PWH engage in more light than moderate-to-vigorous PA, light PA may be beneficial to cognition. Longitudinal studies are needed to understand PA dose-response associations with cognitive trajectories, cognitive domain specificity of PA effects, and underlying neural mechanisms of PA.
