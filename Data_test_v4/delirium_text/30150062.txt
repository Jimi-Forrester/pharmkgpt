30150062|t|Leptin, hsCRP, TNF-alpha and IL-6 levels from normal aging to dementia: Relationship with cognitive and functional status.
30150062|a|Cognitive impairment, including mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia, compromises the patients' cognitive abilities and, to different extents, to carry out daily activities, accompanied by personality and behavioral changes. Studies suggest that leptin, an adipokine, has a neuroprotective role against Alzheimer's disease (AD) and that cytokines are associated with inflammatory processes and dementia. This study aimed to evaluate serum leptin, hsCRP, IL-6 and TNF-alpha levels in a cognitive continuum group from normal to demential status, and to assess whether they correlates to Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Functional Assessment Staging (FAST) scores. Forty-three participants were included, of whom 12 with probable AD, 18 with MCI and 13 with no objective cognitive decline. Serum leptin and hsCRP levels were evaluated by immunoturbidimetric method, and IL-6 and TNF-alpha by ELISA. Higher TNF-alpha levels were found in individuals with FAST stages 1/2 and normal scores evaluated by MMSE. hsCRP levels were inversely correlated with FAST stages. No association with function or global cognition was observed for leptin and IL-6 levels. However, women presented higher leptin serum levels than men while lower leptin and IL-6 levels were observed in individuals aged >=59 years. Our results suggest that TNF-alpha is associated with cognitive and functional decline and that inflammation could be a substrate of cognitive impairment at early clinical stages of dementia.
