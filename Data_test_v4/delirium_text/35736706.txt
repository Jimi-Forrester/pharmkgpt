35736706|a|This study examined the leaves of Baccharis macrantha to obtain extracts of Baccharis macrantha (EBM) and to determine the total flavonoid content (TFC) and the total polyphenol content (TPC). The main objective of this work was to quantify TPC and TFC of extracts of B. macrantha from Ecuador and evaluate its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities and inhibition of lipid peroxidation. The extraction method was optimized with solvents, ethanol, and methanol, at temperatures of 30-60  C and extraction times of 5-20 min. The optimal TFC extraction conditions were at EtOH25% at 50  C for 10 min. The optimal TPC extraction conditions were at EtOH50% at 50  C for 10 min. EBM was characterized by TLC and HPLC with three standards: gallic acid, catechin, and quercetin. EBM-EtOH25% and EBM-EtOH50% obtained at 50  C for 10 min were used to identify quercetin and evaluate biologicals activities. Quercetin was detected in EBM (EtOH25% and EtOH50%). EBM anti-inflammatory activity was evaluated with the red blood cell stabilization (RBC) method. The RBC model showed values of 49.72% of protection lysis RBC to EBM-EtOH25% and 50.71% of protection lysis RBC to EBM-EtOH50%. The EBM in vitro inhibition of lipid peroxidation showed a protection of 77.00% (EtOH25%) and 73.11% (EtOH50%) when the TBARs method was used. EBM-EtOH25% and EtOH50% showed high antioxidant activity. EBM-EtOH25% presented values of ABTS (1172 micromol TE/g EBM), DPPH (836 micromol TE/g, EBM), and FRAP (85.70 micromol TE/g, EBM).
