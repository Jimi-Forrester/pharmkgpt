29617684|t|Characteristics of Mild Cognitive Impairment Using the Thai Version of the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease Tests: A Multivariate and Machine Learning Study.
29617684|a|BACKGROUND: The Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) developed a neuropsychological battery (CERAD-NP) to screen patients with Alzheimer's dementia. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) has received attention as a pre-dementia stage. OBJECTIVES: To delineate the CERAD-NP features of MCI and their clinical utility to externally validate MCI diagnosis. METHODS: The study included 60 patients with MCI, diagnosed using the Clinical Dementia Rating, and 63 normal controls. Data were analysed employing receiver operating characteristic analysis, Linear Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, Adaptive Boosting, Neural Network models, and t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding (t-SNE). RESULTS: MCI patients were best discriminated from normal controls using a combination of Wordlist Recall, Wordlist Memory, and Verbal Fluency Test. Machine learning showed that the CERAD features learned from MCI patients and controls were not strongly predictive of the diagnosis (maximal cross-validation 77.2%), whilst t-SNE showed that there is a considerable overlap between MCI and controls. CONCLUSIONS: The most important features of the CERAD-NP differentiating MCI from normal controls indicate impairments in episodic and semantic memory and recall. While these features significantly discriminate MCI patients from normal controls, the tests are not predictive of MCI.
