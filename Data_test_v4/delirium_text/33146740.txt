33146740|a|Older people often report a decline in their cognitive functions - memory problems and difficulty finding words are frequently mentioned. In this context it is essential to differentiate between age-related cognitive decline and pathological processes as they occur in the context of dementia. Neuropsychological diagnostics make an important contribution to this distinction. Using cognitive tests, the quality and quantity of cognitive deficits can be determined. Moreover, the cognitive profile can be used to generate hypotheses about the etiology of the cognitive impairment. In order to avoid a misdiagnosis, factors such as drug side effects, loss of vision and hearing, the presence of depressive symptoms or states of delirium should be taken into account.
