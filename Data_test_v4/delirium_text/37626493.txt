37626493|t|COVID-19 and Neurological Manifestations.
37626493|a|Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a newly emerged coronavirus, has sparked a global pandemic with its airborne transmission and ability to infect with asymptomatic patients. The pathophysiology is thought to relate to the binding of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors in the body. These receptors are widely expressed in various body organs such as the lungs, the heart, the gastrointestinal tract (GIT), and the brain. This article reviews the current knowledge on the symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), highlighting the neurological symptoms that are associated with COVID-19, and discussing the possible mechanisms for SARS-CoV-2 virus infection in the body.
