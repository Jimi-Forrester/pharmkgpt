38791285|t|Combinatory Nanovesicle with siRNA-Loaded Extracellular Vesicle and IGF-1 for Osteoarthritis Treatments.
38791285|a|Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have been found to have the characteristics of their parent cells. Based on the characteristics of these EVs, various studies on disease treatment using mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-derived EVs with regenerative activity have been actively conducted. The therapeutic nature of MSC-derived EVs has been shown in several studies, but in recent years, there have been many efforts to functionalize EVs to give them more potent therapeutic effects. Strategies for functionalizing EVs include endogenous and exogenous methods. In this study, human umbilical cord MSC (UCMSC)-derived EVs were selected for optimum OA treatments with expectation via bioinformatics analysis based on antibody array. And we created a novel nanovesicle system called the IGF-si-EV, which has the properties of both cartilage regeneration and long-term retention in the lesion site, attaching positively charged insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) to the surface of the UCMSC-derived Evs carrying siRNA, which inhibits MMP13. The downregulation of inflammation-related cytokine (MMP13, NF-kB, and IL-6) and the upregulation of cartilage-regeneration-related factors (Col2, Acan) were achieved with IGF-si-EV. Moreover, the ability of IGF-si-EV to remain in the lesion site for a long time has been proven through an ex vivo system. Collectively, the final constructed IGF-si-EV can be proposed as an effective OA treatment through its successful MMP13 inhibition, chondroprotective effect, and cartilage adhesion ability. We also believe that this EV-based nanoparticle-manufacturing technology can be applied as a platform technology for various diseases.
