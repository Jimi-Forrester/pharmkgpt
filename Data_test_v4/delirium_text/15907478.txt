15907478|a|Markers of oxidative stress in peripheral blood from patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) were analyzed. Thirty-three AD patients were recruited. Plasma antioxidant power (AOP), plasma Cystatin C as well as Cathepsin D in PBL were evaluated. We found that the AOP levels were significantly decreased in AD patients if compared to healthy donors, while the plasma level of Cystatin C was significantly higher. Importantly, a significantly decreased expression of Cathepsin D in PBL was also observed. These results suggest that oxidative imbalance in the peripheral blood of AD patients could mirror oxidative changes previously described in the central nervous system.
