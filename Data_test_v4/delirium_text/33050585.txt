33050585|t|N-Alkylated Iminosugar Based Ligands: Synthesis and Inhibition of Human Lysosomal beta-Glucocerebrosidase.
33050585|a|The scope of a series of N-alkylated iminosugar based inhibitors in the d-gluco as well as d-xylo configuration towards their interaction with human lysosomal beta-glucocerebrosidase has been evaluated. A versatile synthetic toolbox has been developed for the synthesis of N-alkylated iminosugar scaffolds conjugated to a variety of terminal groups via a benzoic acid ester linker. The terminal groups such as nitrile, azide, alkyne, nonafluoro-tert-butyl and amino substituents enable follow-up chemistry as well as visualisation experiments. All compounds showed promising inhibitory properties as well as selectivities for beta-glucosidases, some exhibiting activities in the low nanomolar range for beta-glucocerebrosidase.
