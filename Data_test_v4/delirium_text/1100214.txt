1100214|t|Cucumber shaped and 35 nm particles in Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
1100214|a|A 63 year old female with the ataxic form of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is presented. In addition to amyloid plaques which were not associated with Alzheimer's neurofibrillary tangles, rare profiles similar to those reported in Scrapie were also seen. To our knowledge, these profiles have never been observed in CJD and their presence in this condition adds a further morphologic similarity between the human and animal forms of subacute spongiform "viral" encephalopathies.
