2572983|t|N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors and Alzheimer's disease.
2572983|a|The results of several studies now suggest that the density of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors is maintained in many Alzheimer's disease (AD) cases, although loss of these receptors can occur in specific regions as a consequence of severe neuronal loss. Recent findings demonstrate that there are at least two subtypes of the NMDA receptor which are allosterically regulated. To determine the status of the NMDA receptor in AD, studies are required which will examine the activation state of the NMDA receptor and the properties of subtypes in relation to neuronal density and structure.
