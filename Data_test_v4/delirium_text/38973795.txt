38973795|a|Introduction: Metastatic disease is one of the main causes of death and factors affecting overall survival. It is known that selected patients with pulmonary oligometastases whose primary tumor is under control and who have adequate respiratory capacity may benefit from metastasectomy by resecting all detected lesions. Aim: To report our findings on the use of video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) for pulmonary metastasectomy, with a focus on identifying suitable candidates. Material and methods: Between August 2010 and 2023 a total of 532 pulmonary metastasectomy procedures were performed in our institution. Metastasectomy was performed with VATS for 281 of those patients. Results: VATS metastasectomy was performed in 131 patients with a single lesion on preoperative imaging, while 110 patients underwent metastasectomy for multiple lesions. The rate was significantly (p < 0.05) lower in the group with multiple lesions removed during surgery (38 months) than in the group with only one lesion removed during surgery (60 months). The predicted survival time in the group with other tumor histology (79 months) was significantly (p < 0.05) higher than in the groups with tumor histology carcinoma (41.4 months) and sarcoma (55.5 months). Conclusions: The best prognosis after metastasectomy is provided in cases with a single nodule. Grade is also an important prognostic factor affecting survival, particularly for grade 1 tumor. The histopathological type of the primary tumor is also a significant prognostic factor affecting survival after pulmonary metastasectomy in secondary pulmonary neoplasms, particularly for sarcoma and carcinoma.
