38505174|t|Alcohol Withdrawal Severity Measures for Identifying Patients Requiring High-Intensity Care.
38505174|a|OBJECTIVES: Alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) may progress to require high-intensity care. Approaches to identify hospitalized patients with AWS who received higher level of care have not been previously examined. This study aimed to examine the utility of Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment Alcohol Revised (CIWA-Ar) for alcohol scale scores and medication doses for alcohol withdrawal management in identifying patients who received high-intensity care. DESIGN: A multicenter observational cohort study of hospitalized adults with alcohol withdrawal. SETTING: University of Chicago Medical Center and University of Wisconsin Hospital. PATIENTS: Inpatient encounters between November 2008 and February 2022 with a CIWA-Ar score greater than 0 and benzodiazepine or barbiturate administered within the first 24 hours. The primary composite outcome was patients who progressed to high-intensity care (intermediate care or ICU). INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN RESULTS: Among the 8742 patients included in the study, 37.5% (n = 3280) progressed to high-intensity care. The odds ratio for the composite outcome increased above 1.0 when the CIWA-Ar score was 24. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) at this threshold were 0.12 (95% CI, 0.11-0.13), 0.95 (95% CI, 0.94-0.95), 0.58 (95% CI, 0.54-0.61), and 0.64 (95% CI, 0.63-0.65), respectively. The OR increased above 1.0 at a 24-hour lorazepam milligram equivalent dose cutoff of 15 mg. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV at this threshold were 0.16 (95% CI, 0.14-0.17), 0.96 (95% CI, 0.95-0.96), 0.68 (95% CI, 0.65-0.72), and 0.65 (95% CI, 0.64-0.66), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Neither CIWA-Ar scores nor medication dose cutoff points were effective measures for identifying patients with alcohol withdrawal who received high-intensity care. Research studies for examining outcomes in patients who deteriorate with AWS will require better methods for cohort identification.
