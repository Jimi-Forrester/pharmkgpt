31547050|t|Functional Expression of Choline Transporters in the Blood-Brain Barrier.
31547050|a|Cholinergic neurons in the central nervous system play a vital role in higher brain functions, such as learning and memory. Choline is essential for the synthesis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine by cholinergic neurons. The synthesis and metabolism of acetylcholine are important mechanisms for regulating neuronal activity. Choline is a positively charged quaternary ammonium compound that requires transporters to pass through the plasma membrane. Currently, there are three groups of choline transporters with different characteristics, such as affinity for choline, tissue distribution, and sodium dependence. They include (I) polyspecific organic cation transporters (OCT1-3: SLC22A1-3) with a low affinity for choline, (II) high-affinity choline transporter 1 (CHT1: SLC5A7), and (III) choline transporter-like proteins (CTL1-5: SLC44A1-5). Brain microvascular endothelial cells, which comprise part of the blood-brain barrier, take up extracellular choline via intermediate-affinity choline transporter-like protein 1 (CTL1) and low-affinity CTL2 transporters. CTL2 is responsible for excreting a high concentration of choline taken up by the brain microvascular endothelial cells on the brain side of the blood-brain barrier. CTL2 is also highly expressed in mitochondria and may be involved in the oxidative pathway of choline metabolism. Therefore, CTL1- and CTL2-mediated choline transport to the brain through the blood-brain barrier plays an essential role in various functions of the central nervous system by acting as the rate-limiting step of cholinergic neuronal activity.
