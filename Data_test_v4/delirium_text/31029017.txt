31029017|a|Metabolic conditions during brain development may have long-term consequences on brain metabolism, thereby influencing the risk of neurodegenerative disease in later life. To ascertain the long-term consequences of omega-3 (omega3) fatty acid deficiency during brain development on oxidative fatty acid degradation in the brain and the development of Alzheimer-like pathology, wild-type (WT) female mice were fed diets that were either replete or deficient in omega3 fatty acids for 5 weeks. These females were then mated with hemizygous 5xFAD male transgenic (TG) mouse models of Alzheimer's disease, and the progeny were continued on diets that were either omega3-replete or omega3-deficient. When the progeny were 6 months of age, they received radiolabeled arachidonic acid (ARA) by intracerebroventricular injection. Five days after these injections, the brains were harvested and oxidative degradation of the radiolabeled ARA was characterized. Among the progeny of female mice on an omega3-replete diet, TG progeny had lower PSD-95 expression and higher oxidative ARA degradation than WT progeny. Progeny on an omega3-deficient diet, however, had no significant differences in PSD-95 expression between TG and WT mice, or in the extent of ARA degradation. In TG mice, an omega3-deficient diet reduced oxidative ARA degradation to a greater extent than in WT mice. The reductions in oxidative ARA degradation occurred even if the progeny of female mice on an omega3-deficient diet resumed an omega3-replete diet immediately on weaning. These results demonstrate that dietary omega3 fatty acid deficiency during development can cause long-term changes in the expression of a synaptic marker and long-term reductions in the rate of ARA degradation in the WT brain, which are not completely alleviated by an omega3-replete diet after weaning. The elimination of differences between TG and WT mice by an omega3-deficient diet suggests that mechanisms regulating PSD-95 expression and the oxidative degradation of ARA are related and that the timing of dietary omega3 intake during development may influence Alzheimer's disease-related pathological changes later in life.
