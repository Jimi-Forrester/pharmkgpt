33435577|t|Oxidative Stress and Neurodevelopmental Outcomes in Rat Offspring with Intrauterine Growth Restriction Induced by Reduced Uterine Perfusion.
33435577|a|Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality and is worldwide associated with delayed neurodevelopment. The exact mechanism involved in delayed neurodevelopment associated with IUGR is still unclear. Reduced uterine perfusion (RUP) is among the main causes of placental insufficiency leading to IUGR, which is associated with increases in oxidative stress. This study investigated whether oxidative stress is associated with delayed neurodevelopment in IUGR rat pups. Pregnant rats were exposed to RUP surgery on gestational day 14 to generate IUGR rat offspring. We evaluated offspring's morphometric at birth, and neurodevelopment on postnatal day 21 (PD21) as well as markers of oxidative stress in plasma and brain. Offspring from dams exposed to RUP showed significant (p < 0.05) lower birth weight compared to controls, indicating IUGR. Motor and cognitive deficits, and levels of oxidative stress markers, were significantly (p < 0.05) elevated in IUGR offspring compared to controls. IUGR offspring showed significant (p < 0.05) negative correlations between brain lipid peroxidation and neurocognitive tests (open field and novel object recognition) in comparison with controls. Our findings suggest that neurodevelopmental delay observed in IUGR rat offspring is associated with increased levels of oxidative stress markers.
