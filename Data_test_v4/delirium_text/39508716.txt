39508716|a|INTRODUCTION: Factors responsible for the deposition of pathological tau in the brain are incompletely understood. This study links macroscale tau deposition in the human brain to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow dynamics using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI). METHODS: Low-frequency (< 0.1 Hz) resting-state global brain activity is coupled with CSF flow and potentially reflects CSF dynamics-related clearance. We examined the correlation between rsfMRI measures of CSF inflow and global activity (gBOLD-CSF coupling) as a predictor, interacting with amyloid beta (Abeta), of tau and cortical thickness (dependent variables) across Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) participants from cognitively unimpaired through mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). RESULTS: Tau deposition in Abeta+ participants, accompanied by cortical thinning and cognitive decline, is associated with decreased gBOLD-CSF coupling. Tau mediates the relationship between coupling and thickness. DISCUSSION: Findings suggest that resting-state global brain activity and CSF movements comodulate Alzheimer's tau deposition, presumably related to CSF clearance. HIGHLIGHTS: A non-invasive functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) assessment of a CSF clearance-related process is carried out. Global brain activity is coupled with CSF inflow in human fMRI during resting state. Global fMRI-CSF coupling is correlated with tau in Alzheimer's disease (AD). This coupling measure is also associated with cortical thickness, mediated by tau.
