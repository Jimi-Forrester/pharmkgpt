32327906|a|A number of digestive and extra-digestive disorders, including inflammatory bowel diseases, irritable bowel syndrome, intestinal infections, metabolic syndrome and neuropsychiatric disorders, share a set of clinical features at gastrointestinal level, such as infrequent bowel movements, abdominal distension, constipation and secretory dysfunctions. Several lines of evidence indicate that morphological and molecular changes in intestinal epithelial barrier and enteric neuromuscular compartment contribute to alterations of both bowel motor and secretory functions in digestive and extra-digestive diseases. The present review has been conceived to provide a comprehensive and critical overview of the available knowledge on the morphological and molecular changes occurring in intestinal epithelial barrier and enteric neuromuscular compartment in both digestive and extra-digestive diseases. In addition, our intent was to highlight whether these morphological and molecular alterations could represent a common path (or share some common features) driving the pathophysiology of bowel motor dysfunctions and related symptoms associated with digestive and extra-digestive disorders. This assessment might help to identify novel targets of potential usefulness to develop original pharmacological approaches for the therapeutic management of such disturbances.
