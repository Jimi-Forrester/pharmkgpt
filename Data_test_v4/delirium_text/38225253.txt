38225253|t|Association of amyloid-beta with depression or depressive symptoms in older adults without dementia: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
38225253|a|Several lines of evidence have indicated that depression might be a prodromal symptom of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This systematic review and meta-analysis investigated the cross-sectional association between amyloid-beta, one of the key pathologies defining AD, and depression or depressive symptoms in older adults without dementia. A systematic search in PubMed yielded 689 peer-reviewed articles. After full-text screening, nine CSF studies, 11 PET studies, and five plasma studies were included. No association between amyloid-beta and depression or depressive symptoms were found using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (0.15; 95% CI: -0.08; 0.37), positron emission topography (PET) (Cohen's d: 0.09; 95% CI: -0.05; 0.24), or plasma (-0.01; 95% CI: -0.23; 0.22). However, subgroup analyses revealed an association in plasma studies of individuals with cognitive impairment. A trend of an association was found in the studies using CSF and PET. This systematic review and meta-analysis suggested that depressive symptoms may be part of the prodromal stage of dementia.
