32033424|t|Absorption and Intestinal Metabolic Profile of Oleocanthal in Rats.
32033424|a|Oleocanthal (OLC), a phenolic compound of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), has emerged as a potential therapeutic agent against a variety of diseases due to its anti-inflammatory activity. The aim of the present study is to explore its in vivo intestinal absorption and metabolism. An in situ perfusion technique in rats was used, involving simultaneous sampling from the luminal perfusate and mesenteric blood. Samples were analysed by UHPLC-MS-MS for the presence of oleocanthal (OLC) and its metabolites. OLC was mostly metabolized by phase I metabolism, undergoing hydration, hydrogenation and hydroxylation. Phase II reactions (glucuronidation of hydrogenated OLC and hydrated metabolites) were observed in plasma samples. OLC was poorly absorbed in the intestine, as indicated by the low effective permeability coefficient (2.23 +- 3.16 x 10-5 cm/s) and apparent permeability coefficient (4.12 +- 2.33 x 10-6 cm/s) obtained relative to the values of the highly permeable reference compound levofloxacin (LEV). The extent of OLC absorption reflected by the area under the mesenteric blood-time curve normalized by the inlet concentration (AUC) was also lower than that of LEV (0.25 +- 0.04 vs. 0.64 +- 0.03, respectively). These results, together with the observed intestinal metabolism, suggest that OLC has a moderate-to-low oral absorption; but higher levels of OLC are expected to reach human plasma vs. rat plasma.
