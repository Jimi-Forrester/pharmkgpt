34439462|a|Fisetin has numerous therapeutic properties, such as anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, and anticancer effects. However, the mechanism by which fisetin inhibits NLRP3 inflammasome remains unclear. In this study, we observed that fisetin bound to TLR4 and occluded the hydrophobic pocket of MD2, which in turn inhibited the binding of LPS to the TLR4/MD2 complex. This prevented the initiation of scaffold formation by the inhibition of MyD88/IRAK4 and subsequently downregulated the NF-kappaB signaling pathway. The result also demonstrated that fisetin downregulated the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome induced by LPS and ATP (LPS/ATP) and the subsequent maturation of IL-1beta. Fisetin also activated mitophagy and prevented the accumulation of damaged mitochondria and the excessive production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species. The transient knockdown of p62 reversed the inhibitory activity of fisetin on the LPS/ATP-induced formation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. This indicated that fisetin induces p62-mediated mitophagy for eliminating damaged mitochondria. Recently, the existence of inflammasomes in non-mammalian species including zebrafish have been identified. Treatment of an LPS/ATP-stimulated zebrafish model with fisetin aided the recovery of the impaired heart rate, decreased the recruitment of macrophage to the brain, and gradually downregulated the expression of inflammasome-related genes. These results indicated that fisetin inhibited the TLR4/MD2-mediated activation of NLRP3 inflammasome by eliminating damaged mitochondria in a p62-dependent manner.
