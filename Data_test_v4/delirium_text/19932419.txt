19932419|a|Obliterative vaginal surgery is an appropriate management option for pelvic organ prolapse in women who do not desire future vaginal intercourse. When colpoclesis is not technically feasible, constricting repairs can be performed. Obliterative surgery in older women has the advantages of fewer complications and less surgical time than reconstructive procedures, especially in those with medical comorbidities. Age-related changes in physiology should be kept in mind along with the risk of postoperative delirium. Candidates should be counseled regarding high success and satisfaction rates.
