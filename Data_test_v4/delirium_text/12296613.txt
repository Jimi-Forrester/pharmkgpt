12296613|t|Galantamine provides broad benefits in patients with 'advanced moderate' Alzheimer's disease (MMSE < or = 12) for up to six months.
12296613|a|We investigated whether galantamine (Reminyl), a cholinergic agent with a dual mode of action for the treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD), would benefit patients with more advanced illness. We performed a post hoc analysis on pooled data from four pivotal studies in patients with 'advanced moderate' AD: baseline Mini-Mental State Evaluation (MMSE) scores < or = 12 (range 10-12; mean MMSE score 11) or Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog) scores >30 (range 31-69; mean ADAS-cog score 39). Over 5-6 months, cognitive abilities were improved with galantamine versus placebo (p<0.001; mean treatment difference 6.5 points). At 6 months, galantamine benefited functional abilities (p<0.001 vs placebo). The first quartile of galantamine patients improved over baseline by 10.5 ADAS-cog points. Cognitive and functional abilities were maintained around baseline; behavioural symptoms were delayed. Over 6 months, galantamine provided a broad spectrum of benefits to patients with 'advanced moderate' AD.
