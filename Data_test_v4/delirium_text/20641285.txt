20641285|a|6-(3'-[<sup>18</sup>F]Fluoropropyl)-2-(4'-dimethylaminophenylimidazol[1,2-a]pyridine ([<sup>18</sup>F]FPPIP) is a radioligand that was developed for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of amyloid-b (Ab) plaques in the central nervous system (CNS) for detection of Alzheimer s disease (AD) (1). <sup>18</sup>F is a positron emitter with a physical <i>t</i><sub> </sub> of 109.7 min. Ab-peptide was sequenced from the meningeal blood vessels of AD patients and individuals with Downs syndrome (2). Ab peptides contain 40 42 amino acid residues and are metabolic products of the Ab precursor protein (APP) from cleavage by b- and g-secretases (3). Ab is also identified as the primary component of the neuritic plaques of AD patient brain tissue (4). The cloning of the gene that encodes the APP and its localization to chromosome 21 led to the hypothesis that Ab accumulation is the primary event in AD pathogenesis (2, 5). This hypothesis proposes that neuronal death in AD is related to the toxic effect of Ab on the adjacent cell bodies or cell processes (6). AD is a progressive, neurodegenerative disorders of the CNS, and is characterized by a common set of clinical and pathological features (3). In addition to Ab, the microtubule-associated protein tau is also found in the cell body and axons of neurons as neurofibrillary tangles. The search for a cure or effective treatment of AD requires <i>in vivo</i> detection and quantification of Ab in the brain for evaluation of the efficacy of AD therapy (3). Various amyloid-imaging probes have been developed for PET, single-photon emission computed tomography, and optical imaging. These compounds generally have high binding affinity for amyloid fibrils and adequate permeability of blood brain barrier (BBB) (7). Klunk et al. (8) studied [<sup>11</sup>C]6-OH-BTA-1 in AD patients and showed the potential usefulness of these probes. [<sup>123</sup>I]6-iodo-2(4'-<i>N</i>,<i>N</i>'-dimethylamino)phenylimidazol[1,2-a]pyridine ([<sup>123</sup>I]IMPY) has been reported as a potential SPECT agent for imaging Ab plaques. Because PET can provide more accurate quantitative imaging, Zeng et al. (1) developed <sup>18</sup>F-labeled IMPY analogs for PET imaging of AD plaques. [<sup>18</sup>F]FPPIP is produced by replacing the iodo group on IMPY with fluoropropyl.
