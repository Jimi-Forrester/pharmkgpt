The purpose of the present study was to reveal the underlying oncogene and mechanism that played a pivotal role in postmenopausal EC patients. METHODS: Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was conducted using the microarray dataset and clinical data of EC patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases to identify significant gene modules and hub genes associated with postmenopausal status in EC patients. LASSO regression was conducted to build and validate the risk model. Finally, expression of hub gene was validated in pre- and post-menopausal EC patients in our center. RESULTS: 1240 common genes were used to construct the WGCNA model. According to the WGCNA results, we identified a brown module with 471 genes which was significantly associated with postmenopausal status in EC patients. Furthermore, we constructed an 11-gene risk signature to predict the overall survival of EC patients. The Kaplan-Meier curve and area under the ROC curve (AUC) of this model showed high accuracy in prediction. We also validate the risk model in patients in our center and it also has a high accuracy. Among the 11 genes, PKD1 was recognized as a potential biomarker in the progression of EC patients with postmenopausal status. CONCLUSION: Taken together, we uncovered a common PKD1-mediated mechanism underlying postmenopausal EC patients' progression by integrated analyses. This finding may improve targeted therapy for EC patients.
