39415533|t|The Role of Propofol in Alcohol Withdrawal Syndrome: A Systematic Review.
39415533|a|The objective of this review was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of propofol in the treatment of critically ill patients diagnosed with alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS). A review was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) criteria, and Embase, MEDLINE (PubMed), Cochrane CENTRAL, and Web of Science were queried for results through June 2024. Studies providing efficacy or safety data associated with propofol with a reported diagnosis of AWS in critically ill patients were included. Studies evaluating pediatric patients, those without quantitative and qualitative outcome data, and those not readily translatable to English were excluded. Five retrospective cohort analyses of 218 patients were included in this systematic review. Patients were found to have both significant and non-significant increases in time to resolution of AWS symptoms when treated with propofol versus the AWS standard of care. Adjunct treatment with propofol was generally associated with reductions in total benzodiazepine use and increases in both ICU length of stay and duration of mechanical ventilation. The results of this systematic review provide the evidence necessary to support the use of propofol as an efficacious and safe medication in the management of severe and refractory AWS. Further investigation is required to determine optimal dosing strategies and durations of therapy. The results of this systematic review demonstrate the clinical utility of propofol as part of the management strategy for severe and refractory AWS.
