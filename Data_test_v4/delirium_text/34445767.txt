34445767|a|The c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) are implicated in many neuropathological conditions, including neurodegenerative diseases. To explore potential JNK3 inhibitors from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved drug library, we performed structure-based virtual screening and identified azelastine (Aze) as one of the candidates. NMR spectroscopy indicated its direct binding to the ATP-binding site of JNK3, validating our observations. Although the antihistamine effect of Aze is well documented, the involvement of the JNK pathway in its action remains to be elucidated. This study investigated the effects of Aze on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced JNK phosphorylation, pro-inflammatory mediators, and cell migration in BV2 microglial cells. Aze was found to inhibit the LPS-induced phosphorylation of JNK and c-Jun. It also inhibited the LPS-induced production of pro-inflammatory mediators, including interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and nitric oxide. Wound healing and transwell migration assays indicated that Aze attenuated LPS-induced BV2 cell migration. Furthermore, Aze inhibited LPS-induced IkappaB phosphorylation, thereby suppressing nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB. Collectively, our data demonstrate that Aze exerts anti-inflammatory and anti-migratory effects through inhibition of the JNK/NF-kappaB pathway in BV2 cells. Based on our findings, Aze may be a potential candidate for drug repurposing to mitigate neuroinflammation in various neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.
