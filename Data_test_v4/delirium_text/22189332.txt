22189332|a|It has been 5 years since the passage of the Basic Act on Countermeasures against Cancer and the Promotion of Cancer Countermeasures. In 2012, the early stage of cancer treatment was desired based on the revision of these master plans for all cancer patients as well as their families. One third of the 1 million annual deaths were caused by cancer in Japan, and predicted that the cancer mortality ratio has been increasing in trend. Less than 10% of the end-of-life stage cancer patients who prefer to die at home fulfill their desire causing a lot of problems. In order to solve the problems, the importance of medical treatment by a team consisted of multi -disciplinary professionals has been sought out. We have erected palliative care team and cancer consulting support center in our hospital to help the patient and their family since 2009. The contents of the consulting subjects were varied and wide, as we have reported in the 21st Japan Society for Home Therapy Research(2010). In case of the cancer patient who displayed with delirium symptom, for instance, there were many occasions we had to stop the home medical treatment. So we studied how to treat a home cancer patient when the patient encountered with delirium symptom.
