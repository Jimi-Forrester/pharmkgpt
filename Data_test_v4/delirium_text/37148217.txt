37148217|t|Pediatric Brucellosis: A Challenging Diagnosis-Case Report.
37148217|a|BACKGROUND: Brucellosis is the second most widely spread zoonotic disease. There is less literature on this disease in Pakistan, leading to delayed diagnosis, or the patient remains undiagnosed. This study aims to contribute to Pediatric brucellosis literature, epidemiological, clinical features, laboratory findings, and treatment. CASE PRESENTATION: We present an 11-year-old child who was admitted to the hospital due to abdominal pain for one month and a fever for 15 days. On abdominal ultrasound, she had hepato-splenomegaly with minimal pleural effusion. A comprehensive diagnostic workup for infectious and immunologic disorders confirmed brucellosis with the antibody tests report. She received doxycycline, rifampin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for three months. The treatment was continued with Syrup Doxycycline (50 mg/5 ml), and Syrup Rifampicin (2 g/100 ml) was prescribed for five weeks. Her symptoms were improved by the end of the treatment. CONCLUSION: Brucella is an intracellular pathogen affecting multi-systems of the human body; thus, the treatment is started with antimicrobials that have penetrative effects on a cell. The treatment can be adjusted based on the age group and the complication of the symptoms.
