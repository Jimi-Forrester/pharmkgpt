36294373|t|Effect of Choline Alphoscerate on the Survival of Glioblastoma Patients: A Retrospective, Single-Center Study.
36294373|a|Cognitive impairment often occurs in glioblastoma (GBM) patients due to the tumor itself and treatment side effects. Choline alphoscerate (L-alpha-glycerylphosphorylcholine, GPC) is frequently used to compensate for cognitive impairment in GBM patients. This study was conducted to determine whether GPC affects the overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) of GBM patients. From 2011 to 2020, 187 isocitrate dehydrongenase (IDH)-wild-type GBM patients were analyzed. The patients were classified based on whether GPC was continuously used for at least 3 or 12 months (mos) after GBM diagnosis. Although GPC usage (>=3 mos) did not make significant differences in survival extension, median OS in the long-term GPC group (>=12 mos) was longer with statistical significance, compared to the control group (<12 mos) (38.3 vs. 24.0 mos, p = 0.004). In addition to younger age, supratentorial location, complete resection, and MGMT promoter methylation, long-term use of GPC (>=12 mos) was significantly associated with longer OS in multivariate analysis (p = 0.019, hazard ratio [HR] 0.532, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.314-0.900). Despite the limitations of this study, long-term GPC use was possibly associated with prolonged survival in GBM patients. Multi-center prospective randomized studies with a large number of patients are needed to validate these findings.
