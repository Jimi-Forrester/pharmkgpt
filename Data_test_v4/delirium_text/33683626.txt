33683626|a|The severity of COVID-19 infection is surging day by day. With the cases increasing daily, it is becoming more and more essential to understand the pathogenic mechanisms underlying the severity of the disease. It is now well known that the infection manifests itself primarily as respiratory, but the involvement of the other organ systems has now been documented in many studies. SARS-CoV-2 can invade the nervous system by a multitude of proposed mechanisms that have been discussed in this review. NF-kappaB and Nrf2 are transcription factors that regulate genes responsible for inflammatory and anti-oxidant response respectively. Specific focus in this review has been given to NF-kappaB and Nrf2 pathways that are involved in the cytokine storm and oxidative stress that are the hallmarks of COVID-19. As the immune injury is an important mechanism of neuro-invasion and neuroinflammation, there is the possible involvement of these two pathways in the neurological complications. The crosstalk mechanisms of these signaling pathways have also been discussed. Immuno-modulators both synthetic and natural are promising candidates in catering to the pathologies targeted in the aforementioned pathways.
