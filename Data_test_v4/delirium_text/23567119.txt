23567119|a|The utility of a simple, low-cost detection platform for label-free electrochemical characterization of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition is demonstrated as a potential tool for screening of small-molecule therapeutic agents for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Technique validation was performed against the standard Ellman's colorimetric assay using the clinically established cholinesterase inhibitor (ChEI), Donepezil (Aricept( )). Electrochemical measurements were obtained by differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) performed using a portable potentiostat system for detection of the enzymatic product, thiocholine (TCh), by direct oxidation on unmodified gold screen-printed electrodes. The IC50 profiles for Donepezil measured in vitro were found to be comparable between both colorimetric and electrochemical detection methods for the analysis of purified human erythrocyte-derived AChE (28+-7 nM by DPV; 26+-8 nM by Ellman's method). The selectivity of this unmodified electrode system was compared to a range of biological sulfur-containing compounds including cysteine, homocysteine, glutathione and methionine as well as ascorbic acid. Preliminary studies also demonstrated the potential applicability of this electrochemical technique for the analysis of Donepezil in crude cholinesterase samples from anterior cortex homogenates of C57BL/6J mice.
