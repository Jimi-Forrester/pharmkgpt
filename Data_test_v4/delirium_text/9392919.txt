9392919|t|Assessment and knowledge in palliative care in second year family medicine residents.
9392919|a|Inadequate physician knowledge, particularly in areas of pain assessment and use of analgesics, has been identified as a major factor contributing to poor pain management in cancer patients. In most medical schools, teaching in Palliative Care at both the undergraduate and postgraduate levels is limited or nonexistent. Baseline knowledge and changes in knowledge in areas relevant to Palliative Care were assessed by the use of 2 16-question examinations (Exams A and B) in 78 second-year Family Medicine Residents from the University of Alberta Family Medicine Residency Program. The residents participated in a two-week rotation on the Acute Palliative Care Unit at the Edmonton General Hospital or Grey Nuns Community Health Centre between September 1991 and February 1996. The residents were randomly assigned on their first day (Time 1) to complete either Exam A or B and were subsequently crossed over on their final day of the rotation to complete the alternate Exam (Time 2). Six domains were represented in the Exams as follows: pain assessment, opioid use, adjuvant medications, delirium, urinary catheterization, and hydration. Improvements were noted in the mean percentage results in Time 2 compared with Time 1 for Exams A, B, and A and B combined. Mean global percentage results were 53 +/- 15 versus 73 +/- 13 (p < 0.001) at Times 1 and 2, respectively. There were significant improvements for domains in Time 2 compared to Time 1 (p < or = 0.05) for combined A and B Exam except for urinary catheterization. Despite these documented improvements in scores, serious deficiencies were identified particularly in the areas of pain assessment and opioid use, namely opioid sude effects and issues involving dependence, addiction, and tolerance. Examinations, such as the two used in this study, can be a useful aid in assessing physician knowledge in addition to structuring teaching in Palliative Care. Examination content will require updating as knowledge in Palliative Care evolves.
