33725225|a|PURPOSE: Flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy is frequently used in intensive care unit, but is a source of discomfort, dyspnea and anxiety for patients. Our objective was to assess the feasibility and tolerance of a sedation using remifentanil target-controlled infusion, to perform fiberoptic bronchoscopy in awake ICU patients. MATERIALS, PATIENTS AND METHODS: This monocentric, prospective observational study was conducted in awake patients requiring fiberoptic bronchoscopy. In accordance with usual practices in our center, remifentanil target-controlled infusion was used under close monitoring and adapted to the patient's reactions. The primary objective was the rate of successful procedures without additional analgesia or anesthesia. The secondary objectives were clinical tolerance and the comfort of patients (graded from "very uncomfortable" to "very comfortable") and operators (numeric scale from 0 to 10) during the procedure. RESULTS: From May 2014 to December 2015, 72 patients were included. Most of them (69%) were hypoxemic and admitted for acute respiratory failure. No additional medication was needed in 96% of the patients. No severe side-effects occurred. Seventy-eight percent of patients described the procedure as "comfortable or very comfortable". Physicians rated their comfort with a median [IQR] score of 9 [8-10]. CONCLUSION: Remifentanil target-controlled infusion administered to perform awake fiberoptic bronchoscopy in critically ill patients is feasible without requirement of additional analgesics or sedative drugs. Clinical tolerance as well as patients' and operators' comfort were good to excellent. This technique could benefit patients' experience.
