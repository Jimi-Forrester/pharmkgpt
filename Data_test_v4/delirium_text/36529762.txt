36529762|t|Confusion assessment method accurately screens for hepatic encephalopathy and predicts short-term mortality in hospitalized patients with cirrhosis.
36529762|a|Hepatic encephalopathy (HE), a subtype of delirium, is common in cirrhosis and associated with poor outcomes. Yet, objective bedside screening tools for HE are lacking. We examined the relationship between an established screening tool for delirium, Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) and short-term outcomes while comparing its performance with previously established measures of cognitive function such as West Haven criteria (WHC). Prospectively enrolled adults with cirrhosis who completed the CAM-ICU from 6/2014-6/2018 were followed for 90 days. Blinded provider-assigned West Haven Criteria (WHC) and other measures of cognitive function were collected. Logistic regression was used to test associations between CAM-ICU status and outcomes. Mortality prediction by CAM-ICU status was assessed using Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristics curves (AUROC). Of 469 participants, 11% were CAM-ICU( +), 55% were male and 94% were White. Most patients were Childs-Pugh class C (59%). CAM-ICU had excellent agreement with WHC (Kappa = 0.79). CAM-ICU( +) participants had similar demographic features to those CAM-ICU(-), but had higher MELD (25 vs. 19, p < 0.0001), were more often admitted to the ICU (28% vs. 7%, p < 0.0001), and were more likely to be admitted for HE and infection. CAM-ICU( +) participants had higher mortality (inpatient:37% vs. 3%, 30-day:51% vs. 11%, 90-day:63% vs. 23%, p < 0.001). CAM-ICU status predicted mortality with AUROC of 0.85, 0.82 and 0.77 for inpatient, 30-day and 90-day mortality, respectively. CAM-ICU easily screens for delirium/HE, has excellent agreement with WHC, and identifies a hospitalized cirrhosis cohort with high short-term mortality.
