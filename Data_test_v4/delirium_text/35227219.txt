35227219|t|Comparison of two different uses of underbody forced-air warming blankets for the prevention of hypothermia in patients undergoing arthroscopic shoulder surgery: a prospective randomized study.
35227219|a|BACKGROUND: Forced-air warming (FAW) is an effective method of preventing inadvertent perioperative hypothermia (IPH). However, its warming effects can be influenced by the style and position of the FAW blanket. This study aimed to compare the effects of underbody FAW blankets being placed under or over patients in preventing IPH. METHODS: Patients (n=100) undergoing elective arthroscopic shoulder surgery in the lateral decubitus position were randomized into either under body (UB) group or the over body (OB) group (50 per group). The body temperature of the patients was recorded from baseline to the end of anesthesia. The incidences of postoperative hypothermia and shivering were also collected. RESULTS: A steady decline in the body temperature was observed in both groups up to 60 minutes after the start of FAW. After 60 minutes of warming, the OB group showed a gradual increase in the body temperature. However, the body temperature still decreased in UB group until 75 minutes, with a low of 35.7C +- 0.4C. Then the body temperature increased mildly and reached 35.8C +- 0.4C at 90 minutes. After 45 minutes of warming, the body temperature between the groups was significantly different (P < 0.05). The incidence of postoperative hypothermia in the UB group was significantly higher than that in the OB group (P = 0.023). CONCLUSIONS: The body temperature was significantly better with the use of underbody FAW blankets placed over patients than with them placed under patients. However, there was not a clinically significant difference in body temperature. The incidence of postoperative hypothermia was much lower in the OB group. Therefore, placing underbody FAW blankets over patients is recommended for the prevention of IPH in patients undergoing arthroscopic shoulder surgery. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This single-center, prospective, RCT has completed the registration of the Chinese Clinical Trial Center at 13/1/2021 with the registration number ChiCTR2100042071 . It was conducted from 14/1/2021 to 30/10/2021 as a single, blinded trial in Sichuan Provincial Orthopedic Hospital.
