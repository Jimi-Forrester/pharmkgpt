28474001|t|Pharmaceutical Use and Spending Trend in Medicare Beneficiaries With Dementia, From 2006 to 2012.
28474001|a|Objectives: The aim of the study was to examine the trend in incidence and prevalence of dementia, use and spending of antidementia and antipsychotic drugs among dementia patients. Methods: Using 2006-2012 Medicare claims data, we identified individuals with diagnosis of dementia and collected their pharmacy claims in 2006-2012. We built regression models to test the trend in number of prescriptions and spending on antidementia, antipsychotic, and other drugs. Results: The prevalence of dementia did not change during our study period. Spending on antidementia and antipsychotic drugs creased to increase in 2011, following the patent expiration of Aricept, Zyprexa, and Seroquel; and total pharmaceutical spending did not change in 2006-2012. Use of antidementia drugs increased during our study period; however, the off-label use of antipsychotic drugs did not decrease. Discussion: Pharmaceutical spending associated with dementia may not be as concerning for Medicare as previously thought; nevertheless, policies that discourage the nonevidence-based off-label use of drugs are warranted.
