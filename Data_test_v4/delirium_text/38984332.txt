38984332|a|BACKGROUND: Depression is a common, chronic, and recurrent mood disorder that has become a worldwide health hazard. Fluoxetine hydrochloride, a common treatment method, can inhibit 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) recycling in the presynaptic membrane; however, the efficacy of a single drug is inadequate. At present, mild-to-moderate depression can be treated with acupuncture of ghost caves, but the clinical curative effect of combined therapy with fluoxetine hydrochloride has not been sufficiently reported. AIM: To evaluate the clinical effect of acupuncture at ghost points combined with fluoxetine hydrochloride in the treatment of mild-to-moderate depression. METHODS: This retrospective study included 160 patients with mild-to-moderate depression who were admitted to Shanghai Hospital of Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine, Affiliated to Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, between January 2022 and June 2023. Patients were separated into a single-agent group (fluoxetine hydrochloride treatment, n = 80) and a coalition group (fluoxetine hydrochloride treatment combined with acupuncture at ghost points, n = 80). Pre-treatment symptoms were recorded, and the clinical curative effect and adverse reactions [Asberg Antidepressant Side Effects Scale (SERS)] were assessed. Depression before and after treatment [Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD)-24], neurotransmitter levels [5-HT, norepinephrine (NE), dopamine (DA)], oxidative stress indicators [superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA)], and sleep quality [Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)] were compared. RESULTS: The total efficacy rate was 97.50% in the coalition group and 86.25% in the single-agent group (P < 0.05). After 2, 4, 6, and 8 wk of treatment, the HAMD, self-rating depression scale, and SERS scores of the coalition and single-agent groups decreased compared with pre-treatment, and the decrease was more significant in the coalition group (P < 0.05). After 8 wk of treatment, the levels of NE, DA, 5-HT, and SOD in the coalition and single-agent groups increased, while the levels of MDA decreased; the increases and decrease in the coalition group were more significant (P < 0.05). The PSQI scores of the coalition and single-agent groups decreased, and the decrease was more significant in the coalition group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Acupuncture at ghost points combined with paroxetine tablets can safely improve depressive symptoms and sleep disorders, regulate neurotransmitter levels, and reduce stress responses in patients with mild-to-moderate depression.
