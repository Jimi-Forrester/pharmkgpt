28234256|t|Association between Mid-Regional Proadrenomedullin Levels and Progression of Deep White Matter Lesions in the Brain Accompanying Cognitive Decline.
28234256|a|BACKGROUND: Adrenomedullin (ADM) is a vasoreactive physiological peptide with anti-inflammatory effects and vasodilative and immunomodulatory actions that is widely distributed throughout the vascular system of the brain. OBJECTIVE: To investigate mid-regional proADM (MR-proADM), a stable fragment of the ADM precursor, and cerebral deep white matter lesions (DWMLs) in association with cognitive decline. METHODS: The study participants were 288 patients (194 men, 94 women) who gave consent to participate in a 5-year longitudinal survey on arteriosclerosis from 2008 to 2013. The Fazekas classification system (Grade [G] 0 [normal] to G3 [severe]) was used for the evaluation of DWMLs on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In addition, all participants were asked to undergo cognitive function tests regarding word/letter fluency, the results of which were assessed for correlations with MR-proADM levels. RESULTS: MR-proADM levels significantly increased with DWML grade progression. The odds ratio for high MR-proADM levels was 3.08 (95% confidence interval: 1.49-5.17) in the groups graded G3 on brain MRI, suggesting that a high level of MR-proADM is an independent risk factor for DWMLs. A significant inverse correlation was observed between MR-proADM levels and cognitive test scores. MR-proADM levels were significantly increased in the G3 group in 2013 compared with 2008. CONCLUSION: MR-proADM levels were significantly different between the DWML groups and inversely correlated with cognitive function test scores, suggesting that high MR-proADM levels and DWMLs are associated with cognitive decline. Therefore, the MR-proADM level may be an effective candidate as a potential diagnostic surrogate marker of cognitive decline.
