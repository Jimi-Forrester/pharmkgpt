32435042|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) are two major types of dementia. Due to shared signs and symptoms, accurate diagnosis of these dementia subtypes is a clinical challenge. We assessed the sensitivity and specificity of the combined use of neuropsychological testing and brain imaging data for the differential diagnosis of these conditions. The study population included 77 patients with either AD or DLB. Ala score was calculated from Mini-Mental State Exam subscores, and the cingulate island sign score (CIScore) was obtained from image analysis of brain perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography. Correlation between Ala score and CIScore values was observed in the subgroup of patients aged <=79 years (r = 0.485, P = 0.002), and the scatter plot revealed that 70% of DLB patients were within the range of cut-off values for DLB. In the group aged >=80 years, there was poor correlation between the Ala and CIScores (r = 0.285, P = 0.083), the average CIScore exceeded the cut-off value, and the scatter plot showed lower sensitivity, illustrating the challenge of discriminating AD from DLB in an older patient population. The concurrent use of Ala score and CIScore enhanced the specificity and the area under the curve in both subgroups, indicating the improved ability of these tests to aid in the differential diagnosis of AD from DLB. Our findings suggest that the use of these methodologies in routine medical practice may increase the sensitivity and specificity of the diagnosis of dementia subtypes.
