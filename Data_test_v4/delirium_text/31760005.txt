31760005|a|Folic acid a synthetic form of folate, is the oxidized form of folate which acts as a coenzyme in one carbon transfer reactions required in the biosynthesis of DNA and RNA and its deficiency could be related to diseases such as neural tube defects, Alzheimer's disease, pregnancy complications and cancer. Inulin is a polydisperse polysaccharide comprising mostly of fructosyl fructose units. An oxidized derivative of this inulin was prepared and used as a complexing agent for folic acid to obtain a polysaccharide bound folic acid conjugate. The aldehyde content and degree of oxidation of the oxidized inulin were determined by acid-base titrations. All the products were characterized by sophisticated spectroscopic and thermal methods of analysis. Release studies of folic acid from conjugates were carried out in different pH media and the results demonstrate the pH-sensitive behavior of the inulin-based delivery system towards the controlled release of folic acid.
