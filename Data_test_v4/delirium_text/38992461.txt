38992461|a|The formation of amyloid beta (Abeta) deposits (senile plaques) is one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study investigates what processes are primarily responsible for their formation. A model is developed to simulate the diffusion of amyloid beta (Abeta) monomers, the production of free Abeta aggregates through nucleation and autocatalytic processes, and the deposition of these aggregates into senile plaques. The model suggests that efficient degradation of Abeta monomers alone may suffice to prevent the growth of senile plaques, even without degrading Abeta aggregates and existing plaques. This is because the degradation of Abeta monomers interrupts the supply of reactants needed for plaque formation. The impact of Abeta monomer diffusivity is demonstrated to be small, enabling the application of the lumped capacitance approximation and the derivation of approximate analytical solutions for limiting cases with both small and large rates of Abeta aggregate deposition into plaques. It is found that the rate of plaque growth is governed by two competing processes. One is the deposition rate of free Abeta aggregates into senile plaques. If this rate is small, the plaque grows slowly. However, if the rate of deposition of Abeta aggregates into senile plaques is very large, the free Abeta aggregates are removed from the intracellular fluid by deposition into the plaques, leaving insufficient free Abeta aggregates to catalyze the production of new aggregates. This suggests that under certain conditions, Abeta plaques may offer neuroprotection and impede their own growth. Additionally, it indicates that there exists an optimal rate of deposition of free Abeta aggregates into the plaques, at which the plaques attain their maximum size.
