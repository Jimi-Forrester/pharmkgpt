33644165|t|Serum neuron-specific enolase: A promising biomarker of silicosis.
33644165|a|BACKGROUND: Silicosis is a type of chronic pulmonary fibrosis caused by long-term inhalation of silica dust particles. There has been no ideal biomarker for the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of silicosis until now. Studies have found that elevated neuron-specific enolase (NSE) concentration in the serum of silicosis patients is helpful for diagnosis and severity assessment of the disease. However, the number of cases in these studies was not enough to arouse attention. AIM: To investigate the clinical significance of serum NSE in the diagnosis and staging of silicosis. METHODS: From January 2017 to June 2019, 326 cases of silicosis confirmed in Quanzhou First Hospital Affiliated to Fujian Medical University were included in the silicosis group. A total of 328 healthy individuals or medical patients without silicosis were included in the control group. Serum NSE concentrations of all subjects were determined by electrochemical luminescence. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in sex, age, smoking index and complications between the silicosis and control groups. The mean serum NSE concentration was 26.57 +- 20.95 ng/mL in the silicosis group and 12.42 +- 2.68 ng/mL in the control group. The difference between the two groups was significant (U = 15187, P = 0.000). Among the 326 patients with silicosis, 103 had stage I silicosis, and the mean serum NSE concentration was 15.55 +- 6.23 ng/mL. The mean serum NSE concentration was 21.85 +- 12.05 ng/mL in 70 patients with stage II silicosis. The mean serum NSE concentration was 36.14 +- 25.72 ng/mL in 153 patients with stage III silicosis. Kruskal-Wallis H test suggested that the difference in serum NSE concentration in silicosis patients in the three groups was significant (H = 130.196, P = 0.000). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis indicated that the area under the curve was 0.858 (95% confidence interval: 0.828-0.888; P = 0.000). When the NSE concentration was 15.82 ng/mL, the Jorden index was the largest, the sensitivity was 72%, and the specificity was 90%. CONCLUSION: Serum NSE concentration may be a promising biomarker for the diagnosis and assessment of severity of silicosis.
