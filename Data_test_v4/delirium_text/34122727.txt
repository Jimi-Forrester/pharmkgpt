34122727|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second-most common neurodegenerative chronic disease affecting both cognitive performance and motor functions in aged people. Yet despite the prevalence of this disease, the current therapeutic options for the management of PD can only alleviate motor symptoms. Research has explored novel substances for naturally derived antioxidant phytochemicals with potential therapeutic benefits for PD patients through their neuroprotective mechanism, targeting oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, abnormal protein accumulation, mitochondrial dysfunction, endoplasmic reticulum stress, neurotrophic factor deficit, and apoptosis. The aim of the present study is to perform a comprehensive evaluation of naturally derived antioxidant phytochemicals with neuroprotective or therapeutic activities in PD, focusing on their neuropharmacological mechanisms, including modulation of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity, growth factor induction, neurotransmitter activity, direct regulation of mitochondrial apoptotic machinery, prevention of protein aggregation via modulation of protein folding, modification of cell signaling pathways, enhanced systemic immunity, autophagy, and proteasome activity. In addition, we provide data showing the relationship between nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and PD is supported by studies demonstrating that antiparkinsonian phytochemicals can activate the Nrf2/antioxidant response element (ARE) signaling pathway and Nrf2-dependent protein expression, preventing cellular oxidative damage and PD. Furthermore, we explore several experimental models that evaluated the potential neuroprotective efficacy of antioxidant phytochemical derivatives for their inhibitory effects on oxidative stress and neuroinflammation in the brain. Finally, we highlight recent developments in the nanodelivery of antioxidant phytochemicals and its neuroprotective application against pathological conditions associated with oxidative stress. In conclusion, naturally derived antioxidant phytochemicals can be considered as future pharmaceutical drug candidates to potentially alleviate symptoms or slow the progression of PD. However, further well-designed clinical studies are required to evaluate the protective and therapeutic benefits of phytochemicals as promising drugs in the management of PD.
