37626967|t|Metabolic Reprogramming toward Aerobic Glycolysis and the Gut Microbiota Involved in the Brain Amyloid Pathology.
37626967|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the formation of senile plaques consisting of fibrillated amyloid-beta (Abeta), dystrophic neurites, and the neurofibrillary tangles of tau. The oligomers/fibrillar Abeta damages the neurons or initiates an intracellular signaling cascade for neuronal cell death leading to Abeta toxicity. The Abeta is a 4 kDa molecular weight peptide originating from the C-terminal region of the amyloid precursor protein via proteolytic cleavage. Apart from the typical AD hallmarks, certain deficits in metabolic alterations have been identified. This study describes the emerging features of AD from the aspect of metabolic reprogramming in the main pathway of carbohydrate metabolism in the human brain. Particularly, the neurons in patients with AD favor glycolysis despite a normal mitochondrial function indicating a Warburg-like effect. In addition, certain dietary patterns are well known for their properties in preventing AD. Among those, a ketogenic diet may substantially improve the symptoms of AD. An effective therapeutic method for the treatment, mitigation, and prevention of AD has not yet been established. Therefore, the researchers pursue the development and establishment of novel therapies effective in suppressing AD symptoms and the elucidation of their underlying protective mechanisms against neurodegeneration aiming for AD therapy in the near future.
