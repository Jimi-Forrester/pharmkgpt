29416872|a|BACKGROUND: Evidence has shown a relationship between dehydration, falls, and pulmonary aspiration among older adults in nursing homes, all of which contribute to loss of independence and quality of life. It is believed that improving communication among healthcare professionals in nursing homes (physicians, nurses, rehabilitation team, psychologist, social workers, dieticians and medical assistants) decreases the number of adverse events in institutionalized patients. This study will evaluate the feasibility of using a set of written signs, designed to caution against the risk of falls, dehydration, and pulmonary aspiration, and will enable the proposal of tailored interventions to manage these events in nursing homes. METHODS/DESIGN: All patients from Campus Neurologico Senior (CNS) nursing home, at risk of falls and/ordysphagia and/or dehydration will be invited to participate in the study. Patients will undertake a screeningrisk assessment and the corresponding risk prompts will be attributed. Study duration will be a minimum ofthree months per participant, including daily record of falls, dehydration and pulmonary aspiration eventsand monthly interview assessments, conducted by a member of the research team. Data of the events that occur will be compared with historical data extracted retrospectively from medical and nursing charts. This study has been approved by the Ethics Committee of the Medical Academic Center of Lisbon, Faculty of Medicine, University of Lisbon (Ref. 176/15). All participants will give their written informed consent before entering the study. DISCUSSION: This study is unique in evaluating the feasibility of a communication system in preventing the three major risks in nursing home. Thoughtful selection and display of proper risk prompts in nursing homes could be an essential step along a path toward efficient communication of risks among healthcare teams. We expect that the displays will be easily applicable given their simplicity, low complexity, and minimal physical requirements. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT03123601. March 7, 2017.
