39311040|t|Comparison of a Fully Automated Platform and an Established ELISA for the Quantification of Neurofilament Light Chain in Patients With Cognitive Decline.
39311040|a|BACKGROUND: Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is the most-used method for neurofilament light chain (NfL) quantification in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Recently, fully automated immunoassays for NfL measurement in CSF and blood have allowed high reproducibility among laboratories, making NfLs suitable for routine use in clinical practice. In this study, we compared the Uman Diagnostics NF-light ELISA with the fully automated platform Lumipulse. METHODS: We enrolled 60 patients with cognitive decline, including Alzheimer disease (AD). CSF NfL levels were measured by a NF-light ELISA kit (UmanDiagnostics), and chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay (CLEIA) on the Lumipulse G1200 platform (Fujirebio Diagnostics). Serum NfLs levels were measured by CLEIA on the Lumipulse G1200. RESULTS: We found a significant, very strong correlation [Spearman rho = 0.94 (0.90-0.96)] between CLEIA and ELISA in CSF, and a significant moderate correlation between CSF and serum with both analytical methods [CLEIA vs serum CLEIA 0.41 (0.16-0.61); ELISA vs serum CLEIA 0.40 (0.15-0.60)]. It is worth noting that CSF CLEIA measurements were approximately 136.12 times higher than the serum measurements. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show a robust correlation between ELISA Uman Diagnostic and the standardized Lumipulse G1200 platform for CSF NfL measurements.
