38052130|t|The effect of black mulberry (Morus nigra) consumption on cognition in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's dementia: A pilot feasibility study.
38052130|a|The purpose of this study was to test the feasibility and the possible effects of black mulberry on cognitive functions in Alzheimer's disease (AD). A total of 39 participants aged 65+ with mild-to-moderate AD were involved and 20 subjects were administered 20g of black mulberry concentrate daily for 12 weeks (intervention group), while 19 received no intervention (control group). Cognitive assessment utilized with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and AD Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog) tests; Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15) used for depression screening. At the end of the study, although MMSE scores decreased (p = 0.003) and GDS-15 scores increased (p = 0.034) in control group, there was no change in intervention group. On the contrary, ADAS-Cog scores decreased in intervention group (p = 0.002) while the control group showed no improvement. This study showed that treatment of black mulberry (Morus nigra) for 12 weeks may slightly improve cognitive function in patients with AD.
