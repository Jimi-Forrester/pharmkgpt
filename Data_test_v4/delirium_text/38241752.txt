38241752|t|Turkish adaptation, reliability, and validity of the detection test for language impairments in adults and the aged.
38241752|a|There is no quick, valid, and reliable screening tool in Turkish that can be used for screening language disorders associated with major neurocognitive disorders (MND). To fill this gap, we designed three distinct studies. In the first study, we adapted the Detection Test for Language Impairments in Adults and the Aged into the Turkish language (DTLA-Tr). In the second study, we collected data from 175 Turkish individuals to determine the normative data of the DTLA-Tr. In the last study, we investigated the psychometric properties of the DLTA-Tr by comparing 17 healthy individuals with 17 patients with Alzheimer's disease and determining its test-retest reliability. As a result of Study 1, the DTLA was adapted to the Turkish adult population. In Study 2, the normative data of the DTLA-Tr were provided. The results of this study indicated a positive correlation between educational level and DTLA-Tr total score. The results of Study 3 showed that the DTLA-Tr has high predictive validity and good test-retest reliability. The DTLA-Tr is a valid and reliable tool for assessing language abilities in both adults and the elderly. The findings of this study have significant implications for the evaluation of language in Turkish-speaking patients with MND.
