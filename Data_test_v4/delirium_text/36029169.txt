36029169|t|The effect of Zingiber Officinale Extract on Preventing Demyelination of Corpus Callosum in a Rat Model of Multiple Sclerosis
36029169|a|Background: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most prevalent neurological disability of young adults. Anti-inflammatory drugs have relative effects on MS. The anti-inflammatory and antioxidative effects of Zingiber officinale (ginger) have been proven in some experimental and clinical investigations. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of ginger extract on preventing myelin degradation in a rat model of MS. Methods: Forty nine male Wistar rats were used in this study and divided into four control groups: the normal group, cuprizone-induced group, sham group (cuprizone [CPZ] + sodium carboxymethyl cellulose [NaCMC]), standard control group (fingolimod + cuprizone), including three experimental groups of CPZ, each receiving three different doses of ginger extract: 150, 300, and 600mg/kg /kg/day. Results: Ginger extract of 600 mg/kg prevented corpus callosum from demyelination; however, a significant difference was observed in the fingolimod group (p < 0.05). Difference in the CPZ group was quite significant (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Treatment with ginger inhibited demyelination and alleviated remyelination of corpus callosum in rats. Therefore, it could serve as a therapeutic agent in the MS.
