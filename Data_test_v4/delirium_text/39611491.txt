39611491|t|Ferroptosis in schizophrenia: Mechanisms and therapeutic potentials (Review).
39611491|a|Schizophrenia, a complex psychiatric disorder, presents with multifaceted symptoms and important challenges in treatment, primarily due to its pathophysiological complexity, which involves oxidative stress and aberrant iron metabolism. Recent insights into ferroptosis, a unique form of iron-dependent cell death characterized by lipid peroxidation and antioxidant system failures, open new avenues for understanding the neurobiological foundation of schizophrenia. The present review explores the interplay between ferroptosis and schizophrenia, emphasizing the potential contributions of disrupted iron homeostasis and oxidative mechanisms to the pathology and progression of this disease. The emerging evidence linking ferroptosis with the oxidative stress observed in schizophrenia provides a compelling narrative for re-evaluating current therapeutic strategies and exploring novel interventions targeting these molecular pathways, such as the glutathione peroxidase 4 pathway and the ferroptosis suppressor protein 1 pathway. By integrating recent advances in ferroptosis research, the current review highlights innovative therapeutic potentials, including N-acetylcysteine, selenium, omega-3 fatty acids and iron chelation therapy, which could address the limitations of existing treatments and improve clinical outcomes for individuals with schizophrenia.
