22323831|t|Use of dietary supplements for cognitive health: results of a national survey of adults in the United States.
22323831|a|We studied use of vitamins, minerals, herbs, and other dietary supplements for cognitive health. We refer to these products as supplements. Data were from the 2007 National Health Interview Survey, which asked about complementary and alternative medicine (n = 22 783). Chi-square and multivariate logistic analyses were weighted for national representativeness, accounting for the survey design. Among supplement users, about 8.8% of those without cognitive problems used them for cognitive health; 15.7% of those with cognitive problems did so. Fish oil, Ginkgo biloba, and vitamins were commonly used for cognitive health. Among supplement users, 38% did not tell health care providers. In adjusted results, adults reporting cognitive problems were more likely than others to use supplements for cognitive health (odds ratio 1.77, confidence interval 1.39-2.25). Adults are more likely to use supplements to treat or cure cognitive problems than to prevent them. Many do not discuss this use with health care providers.
