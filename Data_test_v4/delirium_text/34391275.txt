34391275|a|INTRODUCTION: Depressed level of consciousness and delirium are associated with multiple complications in cognitive, perceptual and sensory functions in the patients of the intensive care units. The present study aimed to determine the effect of foot massage by a nurse and patient's family on the level of consciousness and delirium in patients admitted to the intensive care units (ICU). METHODS: This was a randomized parallel single-blind controlled trial. Seventy-five ICU were assigned in three groups (massage by a nurse, massage by patient's family and control group) by stratified block randomization method. Both feet were massaged with Swedish massage (10 min) once a day for six days by a nurse or patient's family. Delirium and level of consciousness was measured before, and post-intervention. RESULTS: The mean level of consciousness in all the three groups increased significantly one-week post-intervention. However, there was no significant difference in the level of consciousness among the three groups during the study. The frequency of delirium in the massage group by the family was 20% before the intervention, which decreased to 12% after intervention. In the massage group by a nurse and control group, 16% of the samples had delirium before the intervention. After the intervention, the prevalence of delirium was 8% in the massage group by a nurse, and it decreased to 12% in the control group, none of which was statistically significant. CONCLUSION: The use of Swedish foot massage did not change the level of consciousness and delirium of patients admitted to the ICU.
