9447451|t|Motor/psychomotor dysfunction in normal aging, mild cognitive decline, and early Alzheimer's disease: diagnostic and differential diagnostic features.
9447451|a|To determine the association between cognitive dysfunction and motor behavior in older adults, 41 cognitively normal elderly (NL), 25 nondemented patients exhibiting mild cognitive impairment (MI) and at risk for future decline to dementia, and 25 patients with mild (early) Alzheimer's disease (AD) were examined using a wide array of motor/psychomotor and cognitive assessments. The three groups were recruited from an aging and dementia research center and were composed of well-characterized physically healthy volunteers, with similar ages and gender distributions. The outcome measures included 16 motor/psychomotor tests categorized a priori into gross, fine, and complex, as well as eight cognitive tests of memory and language. Relative to the NL group, MI individuals performed poorly on cognitive, fine, and complex motor measures but not on gross motor tests; AD patients performed worse on cognitive and all motor domains. Differences in complex motor function persisted after adjustment for performance on cognitive and on less complex motor tests. Classification analyses showed similar accuracies in discriminating NL from MI and NL from AD cases for both complex motor (79% and 92% accuracy, respectively) and cognitive tests (80% and 93% accuracy, respectively). Less complex motor tests produced poorer accuracies. Among nondemented subjects, education correlated with several cognitive scores but no motor scores. These results indicate that motor impairment is an important aspect of cognitive decline in older adults. Motor/psychomotor assessments were found to be comparably sensitive to traditional tests of cognitive function in identifying persons affected by the earliest stages of AD pathology and may improve identification of at-risk nondemented elderly, especially among diversely educated individuals.
