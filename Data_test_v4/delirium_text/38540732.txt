38540732|t|Emerging Roles of Extracelluar Vesicles Derived from Bacteria, Mammalian or Plant Cells in the Pathogenesis and Clinical Application of Neurodegenerative Diseases.
38540732|a|A growing number of studies have indicated that extracellular vesicles (EVs), such as exosomes, are involved in the development of neurodegenerative diseases. Components of EVs with biological effects like proteins, nucleic acids, or other molecules can be delivered to recipient cells to mediate physio-/pathological processes. For instance, some aggregate-prone proteins, such as beta-amyloid and alpha-synuclein, had been found to propagate through exosomes. Therefore, either an increase of detrimental molecules or a decrease of beneficial molecules enwrapped in EVs may fully or partly indicate disease progression. Numerous studies have demonstrated that dysbiosis of the gut microbiota and neurodegeneration are tightly correlated, well-known as the "gut-brain axis". Accumulating evidence has revealed that the gut bacteria-derived EVs play a pivotal role in mediating microbe-host interactions and affect the function of the "gut-brain axis", which subsequently contributes to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we first briefly discuss the role of EVs from mammalian cells and microbes in mediating the progression of neurodegenerative diseases, and then propose a novel strategy that employs EVs of plants (plant cell-derived exosome-like nanoparticles) for treating neurodegeneration.
