36529828|t|Lipocalin 2-not only a biomarker: a study of current literature and systematic findings of ongoing clinical trials.
36529828|a|Lipocalin 2 (Lcn2), also known as neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, is an innate immune protein encoded by the LCN2 gene. In this study, we investigated various roles and functions of Lcn2 characterized in a systems-based format and evaluated its therapeutic potentials and clinical relevance for diagnosis and prognosis. An additional systematic presentation was presented for 70 ongoing clinical trials utilizing Lcn2 in the diagnostic and prognostic setting as a key outcome measure. With trials being conducted through December 2030, Lcn2 will become all the more relevant given its associations with diseases as a prognostic biomarker. Data also suggests that it plays a role in pathological conditions. The gaps in our understanding of Lcn2, once filled, may improve the immune mediation of acute and chronic disease.
