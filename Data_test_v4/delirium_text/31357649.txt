31357649|t|Isolation of Strong Antioxidants from Paeonia Officinalis Roots and Leaves and Evaluation of Their Bioactivities.
31357649|a|Paeonia officinalis extracts from leaves and roots were tested for their antioxidant potential using in vitro chemical (Folin-Ciocalteu, 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH), 2,2'-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS), oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC), hydroxyl radical antioxidant capacity (HORAC), hydroxyl radical scavenging capacity HOSC)) and cellular antioxidant activity (CAA) assays. Leaf extracts were stronger antioxidants than root extracts, while methanol was a more effective solvent than water in chemical assays. However, the selected water extract of leaves was a stronger antioxidant in CAA than the methanol extract (0.106 vs. 0.046 micromol quercetin equivalents/mg). Twenty compounds were identified by ultra performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole-time-of-flight (UPLC-Q-TOF) mass spectrometer, while on-line screening of their antioxidant capacity by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with a DPPH -scavenging detector revealed that gallic acid derivatives are the major peony antioxidants. Root water and leaf methanol extracts inhibited alpha-amylase in a dose dependent manner. The IC50 value for the strongest inhibitor, the methanol extract of leaves, was 1.67 mg/mL. In addition, the cytotoxicity assessment of extracts using human Caco-2 cells demonstrated that none of them possessed cytotoxic effects.
