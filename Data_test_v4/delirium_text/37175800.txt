37175800|t|Interplay between LncRNAs and microRNAs in Breast Cancer.
37175800|a|(1) Although long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are known to be precursors of microRNAs (miRNAs), they frequently act as competing endogoneous RNAs (ceRNAs), yet still their interplay with miRNA is not well known. However, their interaction with miRNAs may result in the modulation of miRNA action. (2) To determine the contribution of these RNA molecules in tumor resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs, it is essential to consider not only the oncogenic and tumor suppressive function of miRNAs but also the impact of lncRNAs on miRNAs. Therefore, we performed an extensive search in different databases including PubMed. (3) The present study concerns the interplay between lncRNAs and miRNAs in the regulatory post-transcriptional network and their impact on drugs used in the treatment of breast cancer. (4) Consideration of this interplay may improve the search for new drugs to circumvent chemoresistance.
