38613051|t|Study on the Dose-Response Relationship between Magnesium and Type 2 Diabetes of Childbearing Women in the China Adult Chronic Disease and Nutrition Surveillance 2015.
38613051|a|Background: Magnesium (Mg) is an essential element and participates in many metabolic pathways. Many studies have found a certain negative correlation between magnesium and blood glucose parameters, but the dose-response relationship between them is still a relatively narrow research field. We aim to explore the dose-response relationship between plasma and dietary Mg and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) among childbearing women in a nationally representative sample. And we will also initially explore the threshold of dietary and plasma magnesium in the prevention of T2DM and their consistency. Methods: A total of 2912 18-44 year-old childbearing women were recruited from the China Adult Chronic Disease and Nutrition Surveillance (2015). Multivariate logistic regression was used to explore the dose-response relationship between plasma and dietary Mg and glucose parameters. The threshold effect between Mg and T2DM was explored by a restricted cubic spline regression. Results: It was found that when plasma Mg was increased by 0.041 mmol/L, the risk of T2DM, impaired fasting glucose (IFG), and HbA1c-hyperglycemia was reduced by 18%, 19%, and 18%, respectively. The possible threshold value for plasma Mg to prevent the risk of T2DM was 0.87 mmol/L. Through the quality control of the sample dietary survey data, 2469 cases were finally included for dietary analysis. And the possible threshold value for dietary Mg to prevent the risk of T2DM was 408 mg/d. Taking the recommended dietary Mg intake of 330 mg/d as the reference group, when the Mg intake reached 408 mg/d, the risk of T2DM was significantly reduced. And the average plasma Mg level of the people whose dietary intake reached 408 mg/d was 0.87 mmol/L. Conclusions: These results indicate that dietary Mg and plasma Mg have good consistency on the threshold effect of glucose parameters in women of childbearing age.
