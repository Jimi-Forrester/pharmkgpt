32894748|a|BACKGROUND: the aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of emergency department (ED) stay-associated delirium on older patient's functional and cognitive status at 60 days post ED visit. METHODS: this study was part of the multi-centre prospective cohort INDEED study. This project took place between March 2015 and July 2016 in five participating EDs across the province of Quebec. Independent non-delirious patients aged >=65, with an ED stay >=8 hours, were monitored for delirium until 24 hours post ward admission. A 60-day follow-up phone assessment was conducted. Participants were screened for delirium using the Confusion Assessment Method. Functional and cognitive statuses were assessed at baseline and at the 60-day follow-up using OARS and TICS-m. RESULTS: a total of 608 patients were recruited, 393 of which completed the 60-day follow-up. The Confusion Assessment Method was positive in 69 patients (11.8%) during ED stay or within the first 24 hours following ward admission. At 60 days, delirium patients experienced an adjusted loss of -2.9/28 [95%CI: -3.9, -2.0] points on the OARS scale compared to non-delirious patients who lost -1.6 [95%CI: -1.9, -1.3] (P = 0.006). A significant adjusted difference in cognitive function was also noted at 60 days, as TICS-m scores in delirious patients decreased by -1.6 [95%CI: -3.5, 0.2] compared to non-delirious patients, who showed a minor improvement of 0.5 [95%CI: -0.1, 1.1] (P = 0.03). CONCLUSION: seniors who developed ED stay-associated delirium have lower baseline functional and cognitive status than non-delirious patients, and they will experience a more significant decline at 60 days post ED visit.
