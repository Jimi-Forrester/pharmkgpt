38669543|t|NB-02 Protects Neurons and Astrocytes from Oligomeric Amyloid-beta-Mediated Damage.
38669543|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease with limited therapeutic strategies. NB-02 is a novel botanical drug that has shown promise as a protective and therapeutic treatment for AD in an APP/PS1 preclinical mouse model. In this paper, we investigate the underlying mechanisms by which NB-02 provides these therapeutic advantages using in vitro neuron-astrocyte co-cultures. Pretreatment with NB-02 prevented pathological calcium elevations in neurons and astrocytes after application of toxic soluble amyloid-beta (Abeta) oligomers. NB-02 also prevented cell death associated with the addition of soluble Abeta oligomers suggesting NB-02 is effective at protecting both neurons and astrocytes from Abeta-mediated damage.
