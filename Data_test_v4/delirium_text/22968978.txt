22968978|t|QT dispersion in mild cognitive impairment: a possible tool for predicting the risk of progression to dementia?
22968978|a|OBJECTIVE: The aim of this research was to investigate relationships between cognitive function and non-invasive, repeatable cardiac parameters in elderly subjects suffering from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: Two hundred and twenty-four community-living elderly subjects, 31 AD patients, 77 MCI patients, and 116 cognitively normal subjects (CNS), were evaluated for cognitive abilities (Mini Mental State Examination score (MMSE)) and for electrocardiographic [corrected heart rate QT interval dispersion (QTcD)] and echocardiographic [Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)] parameters. RESULTS: Mean values of LVEF were not significantly different between the three groups; QTcD mean values were significantly lower in CNS group than in subjects with MCI and AD. The Pearson Product Moment Correlation test, carried out in the three study groups, showed a significant inverse correlation between QTcD and MMSE score (r = -0.357; p < 0.01) in the group of MCI patients, only. In multivariable-adjusted linear regression tests, QTcD (p = 0.030) and education (p = 0.021) are associated with MMSE score in MCI group. Only the parameter of education appears to predict MMSE in CNS group; none of these parameters appear to predict MMSE in the group of patients with AD. CONCLUSION: The association between QTcD and MMSE requires cautious interpretation and further extensive investigation. However, if confirmed by longitudinal studies, the finding could play a role in the management of the subjects with MCI.
