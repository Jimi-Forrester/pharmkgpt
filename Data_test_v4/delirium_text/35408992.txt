35408992|t|Nutraceuticals as Modulators of Autophagy: Relevance in Parkinson's Disease.
35408992|a|Dietary supplements and nutraceuticals have entered the mainstream. Especially in the media, they are strongly advertised as safe and even recommended for certain diseases. Although they may support conventional therapy, sometimes these substances can have unexpected side effects. This review is particularly focused on the modulation of autophagy by selected vitamins and nutraceuticals, and their relevance in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, especially Parkinson's disease (PD). Autophagy is crucial in PD; thus, the induction of autophagy may alleviate the course of the disease by reducing the so-called Lewy bodies. Hence, we believe that those substances could be used in prevention and support of conventional therapy of neurodegenerative diseases. This review will shed some light on their ability to modulate the autophagy.
