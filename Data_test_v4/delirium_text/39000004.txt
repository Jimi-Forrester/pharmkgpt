39000004|t|The Purinergic P2X7 Receptor as a Target for Adjunctive Treatment for Drug-Refractory Epilepsy.
39000004|a|Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological diseases worldwide. Anti-seizure medications (ASMs) with anticonvulsants remain the mainstay of epilepsy treatment. Currently used ASMs are, however, ineffective to suppress seizures in about one third of all patients. Moreover, ASMs show no significant impact on the pathogenic mechanisms involved in epilepsy development or disease progression and may cause serious side-effects, highlighting the need for the identification of new drug targets for a more causal therapy. Compelling evidence has demonstrated a role for purinergic signalling, including the nucleotide adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) during the generation of seizures and epilepsy. Consequently, drugs targeting specific ATP-gated purinergic receptors have been suggested as promising treatment options for epilepsy including the cationic P2X7 receptor (P27XR). P2X7R protein levels have been shown to be increased in the brain of experimental models of epilepsy and in the resected brain tissue of patients with epilepsy. Animal studies have provided evidence that P2X7R blocking can reduce the severity of acute seizures and the epileptic phenotype. The current review will provide a brief summary of recent key findings on P2X7R signalling during seizures and epilepsy focusing on the potential clinical use of treatments based on the P2X7R as an adjunctive therapeutic strategy for drug-refractory seizures and epilepsy.
