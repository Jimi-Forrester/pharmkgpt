23435411|t|Molecular mechanism of tau aggregation induced by anionic and cationic dyes.
23435411|a|Abnormal tau filaments are a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. Anionic dyes such as Congo Red, Thiazine Red, and Thioflavin S are able to induce tau fibrillization in vitro. SH-SY5Y cells were incubated with each dye for seven days leading to intracellular aggregates of tau protein, with different morphological characteristics. Interestingly, these tau aggregates were not observed when the Methylene Blue dye was added to the cell culture. In order to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon, we developed a computational model for the interaction of the tau paired helical filament (PHF) core with every dye by docking analysis. The polar/electrostatic and nonpolar contribution to the free binding energy in the tau PHF core-anionic dye interaction was determined. We found that the tau PHF core can generate a positive net charge within the binding site localized at residuesLys311 and Lys340 (numbering according to the longest isoform hTau40). These residues are important for the binding affinity of the negative charges present in the anionic dyes causing an electrostatic environment that stabilizes the complex. Tau PHF core protofibril-Congo Red interaction has a stronger binding affinity compared to Thiazine Red or Thioflavin S. By contrast, the cationic dye Methylene Blue does not bind to nor stabilize the tau PHF core protofibrils. These results characterize the driving forces responsible for the binding of tau to anionic dyes leading to their self-aggregation and suggest that Methylene Blue may act as a destabilizing agent of tau aggregates.
