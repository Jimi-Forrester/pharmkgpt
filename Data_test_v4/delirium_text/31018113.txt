31018113|a|Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder and the most common and devastating form of dementia. It affects mainly older people, accounting for 50-80% of dementia cases. The age is the main associated risk factor and based on the onset age, early-onset (EOAD) or late-onset (LOAD) forms are distinguished. AD has a strong impact both on the life-style of patients and their families and on the society, due to the high costs related to social and medical care. So far, despite the great advances in understanding of the AD pathogenesis, there is no a cure for this form of dementia and current available treatments are limited to temporarily relieve symptoms. In this review, firstly we give an overview of the current knowledge of the genetic basis of both forms of AD with a particular emphasis on the insights in the understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms of this disorder. Then we discuss the promising relevance of "omics sciences" and the open challenges of the application of Big Data in promoting precision medicine for AD.
