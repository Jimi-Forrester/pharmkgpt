30466057|t|A case of autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy with prolonged delirium.
30466057|a|Autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy (AAG) is a rare acquired immune-mediated disorder that leads to autonomic failure. It is sometimes complicated by mental and behavioral symptoms. We report a case of 72-year-old male with AAG who was admitted to the psychiatric department for prolonged severe delirium. Repeated loss of consciousness attributed to severe orthostatic hypotension disturbed recovery from delirium. In addition, intracerebral hemorrhage occurred during hospitalization, and this cerebrovascular event may have been substantially affected by unstable blood pressure due to AAG. This case suggests importance of differential diagnosis of AAG in patients with mental and behavioral symptoms accompanying severe autonomic failure.
