31423476|t|Wilson disease and psychiatric symptoms: A brief case report.
31423476|a|Wilson disease (WD) is an uncommon recessive genetic disorder affecting copper metabolism. Cardiac, neurological, hepatic and renal manifestations are well defined, nevertheless approximately 30% of patients debut with neuropsychiatric symptoms. These psychiatric alterations resulting from the accumulation of this heavy metal in the basal ganglia are some how less specific. We present a short review of psychiatric symptoms of WD and describe a case of a 37-year-old woman diagnosed with WD who presented neuropsychiatric symptoms and had a consequent delay in diagnosis and causal treatment. Patients who develop WD starting with a predominance of neuropsychiatric symptoms tend to manifest hepatic symptoms later, therefore have a longer delay of diagnosis and a poorer outcome than patients with hepatic symptoms. An early diagnosis of WD can avoid irreversible neurological damage.
