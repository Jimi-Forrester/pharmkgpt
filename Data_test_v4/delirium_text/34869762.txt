34869762|a|Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD), as one of the common postoperative complications, mainly occurs after surgery and anesthesia, especially in the elderly. It refers to cognitive function changes such as decreased learning and memory ability and inability to concentrate. In severe cases, there could be personality changes and a decline in social behavior. At present, a great deal of research had been carried out on POCD, but its specific mechanism remains unclear. The release of peripheral inflammation-related factors, the degradation and destruction of the blood-brain barrier, the occurrence of central inflammation, and the neuronal apoptosis and synaptic loss could be promoted by neuroinflammation indicating that inflammatory mechanisms may play key roles in the occurrence of POCD.
