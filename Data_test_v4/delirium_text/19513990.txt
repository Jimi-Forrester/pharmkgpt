19513990|a|OBJECTIVES: To investigate the relation of plasma levels of Abeta peptides (Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42) and apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype to dementia status, and the duration of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in adults with Down syndrome (DS). METHODS: Adults with DS were recruited from community settings and followed up for a mean period of 6.7 years. Plasma levels Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42 and APOE genotype were determined at the last visit. RESULTS: There were 83 nondemented participants and 44 participants with prevalent AD. Overall, plasma levels of Abeta1-42, Abeta1-40 and the ratio Abeta1-42/Abeta1-40 did not differ significantly between the adults with DS. Among demented participants, the mean level of Abeta1-40 was significantly lower (157.0 vs. 195.3) and the ratio of Abeta1-42/Abeta1-40 was significantly higher (0.28 vs. 0.16) in those with more than 4 years duration of dementia than in those with 4 or fewer years' duration of dementia. This pattern was generally similar in those with and without an APOE epsilon4 allele. CONCLUSIONS: There is an association between plasma Abeta peptide levels and the duration of AD in older persons with DS. The predictive and diagnostic roles of Abeta1-42 and Abeta1-40 measurements for AD, however, remain controversial. Change in Abeta peptide levels with onset of AD and with the duration of dementia may account for a lack of difference between prevalent cases and nondemented individuals and for variation in the predictive power of Abeta peptide levels.
