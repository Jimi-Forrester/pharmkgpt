33643021|t|Altered Insular Subregional Connectivity Associated With Cognitions for Distinguishing the Spectrum of Pre-clinical Alzheimer's Disease.
33643021|a|Background: Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) are regarded as part of the pre-clinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) spectrum. The insular subregional networks are thought to have diverse intrinsic connectivity patterns that are involved in cognitive and emotional processing. We set out to investigate convergent and divergent altered connectivity patterns of the insular subregions across the spectrum of pre-clinical AD and evaluated how well these patterns can differentiate the pre-clinical AD spectrum. Method: Functional connectivity (FC) analyses in insular subnetworks were carried out among 38 patients with SCD, 56 patients with aMCI, and 55 normal controls (CNs). Logistic regression analyses were used to construct models for aMCI and CN, as well as SCD and CN classification. Finally, we conducted correlation analyses to measure the relationship between FCs of altered insular subnetworks and cognition. Results: Patients with SCD presented with reduced FC in the bilateral cerebellum posterior lobe and increased FC in the medial frontal gyrus and the middle temporal gyrus. On the other hand, patients with aMCI largely presented with decreased FC in the bilateral inferior parietal lobule, the cerebellum posterior lobe, and the anterior cingulate cortex, as well as increased FC in the medial and inferior frontal gyrus, and the middle and superior temporal gyrus. Logistic regression analyses indicated that a model composed of FCs among altered insular subnetworks in patients with SCD was able to appropriately classify 83.9% of patients with SCD and CN, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of 0.876, 81.6% sensitivity, and 81.8% specificity. A model consisting of altered insular subnetwork FCs in patients with aMCI was able to appropriately classify 86.5% of the patients with aMCI and CNs, with an AUC of 0.887, 80.4% sensitivity, and 83.6% specificity. Furthermore, some of the FCs among altered insular subnetworks were significantly correlated with episodic memory and executive function. Conclusions: Patients with SCD and aMCI are likely to share similar convergent and divergent altered intrinsic FC patterns of insular subnetworks as the pre-clinical AD spectrum, and presented with abnormalities among subnetworks. Based on these abnormalities, individuals can be correctly differentiated in the pre-clinical AD spectrum. These results suggest that alterations in insular subnetworks can be utilized as a potential biomarker to aid in conducting a clinical diagnosis of the spectrum of pre-clinical AD.
