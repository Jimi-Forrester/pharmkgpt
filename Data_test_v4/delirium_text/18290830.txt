18290830|t|Is there any role for computed tomography measurements of medial temporal lobe atrophy in dementia? A review of the literature and case series from a memory clinic.
18290830|a|Neuroimaging in dementia has focused on documenting any burden of vascular disease or excluding any reversible intracranial pathology. We review the use of computed tomography to examine for medial temporal lobe atrophy in dementia and compare this with a case series of such measurements from our memory clinic. Measures of medial temporal lobe atrophy were used to separate patients with Alzheimer's disease from those with normal cognition, mood disorders or other forms of early dementia.
