32024303|t|Impending Low Intake Dehydration at Admission to A Geriatric Ward- Prevalence and Correlates in a Cross-Sectional Study.
32024303|a|Dehydration risk increases with frailty and functional dependency, but a limited number of studies have evaluated this association in hospitalized geriatric patients. This cross-sectional study aimed to assess the prevalence and determinants of dehydration in patients admitted to the geriatric ward. Dehydration was diagnosed when calculated osmolarity was above 295 mMol/L. Logistic regression analyses (direct and stepwise backward) were used to assess determinants of impending dehydration. 358 of 416 hospitalized patients (86.1%) were included: 274 (76.5%) women, and 309 (86.4%) 75+ year-old. Dehydration was diagnosed in 209 (58.4%) cases. Significantly higher odds for impending dehydration were observed only for chronic kidney disease with trends for diabetes and procognitive medication when controlling for several health, biochemical, and nutritional parameters and medications. After adjusting for "dementia" the negative effect of "taking procognitive medications" became a significant one. Chronic kidney disease, diabetes, taking procognitive medications and hypertension were the main variables for the outcome prediction according to the stepwise backward regression analysis. This may indicate an additional benefit of reducing the risk of dehydration when using procognitive drugs in older patients with dementia.
