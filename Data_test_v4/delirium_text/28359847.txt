28359847|t|Abeta propagation and strains: Implications for the phenotypic diversity in Alzheimer's disease.
28359847|a|The progressive nature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is thought to occur, at least in part, by the self-replication and spreading of Abeta and Tau aggregates through a prion mechanism. Evidence now exists that structural variants of Abeta prions can propagate their distinct conformations through template-directed folding of naive Abeta peptides. This notion implicates that the first self-propagating Abeta assembly to emerge in the brain dictates the conformation, anatomical spread and pace of subsequently formed deposits. It is hypothesized that a prion mechanism defines the molecular basis underlying the diverse clinicopathologic phenotypes observed across the spectrum of AD patients. Thus, distinct AD strains might require further sub-classification based on biochemical and structural characterization of aggregated Abeta. Here, we review the evidence for distinct, self-propagating Abeta strains, and discuss potential cellular mechanisms that might contribute to their manifestation. From this perspective, we also explore the implications of Abeta strains for current FDA-approved medical imaging probes and therapies for amyloid. Ultimately, the discovery of new molecular tools to differentiate Abeta strains and dissect the heterogeneity of AD may lead to the development of more informative diagnostics and strain-specific therapeutics.
