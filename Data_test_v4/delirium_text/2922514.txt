2922514|t|[The treatment of severe, therapy-resistant depression using infusions of antidepressants].
2922514|a|Infusion-therapy with antidepressants has been of value in severe as well as therapy resistant depressive states. In addition to doses lower than those used for oral treatment, a more rapid onset of therapeutic effect and a better tolerance, the beneficial effect seems also to depend on the setting in which the treatment takes place. Infusion-therapy is a combined pharmacopsychotherapeutic procedure. Next to infusion-treatment a pretreatment with neuroleptics is advised either via the oral or parenteral route. In extremely refractory depression the infusion-therapy can be applied twice a day; in some cases we resort to continuous infusion for a few days. Infusion-therapy is not applicable in patients prone to epileptic seizures or with serious cerebral dysfunction with a risk of delirium. In case of doubt an EEG is mandatory. Tricyclic antidepressants may not be used in cardiac diseases especially those with troubles of the conduction propagation or repolarization.
