27046230|a|This work describes the synthesis and the biological evaluation of novel benzylidenephenylpyrrolizinones as potential antioxidant, metal chelating or amyloid beta (betaA) aggregation inhibitors. Some derivatives exhibited interesting results in regard to several of the performed evaluations and appear as valuable Multi-Target Directed Ligands with potential therapeutic interest in Alzheimer's disease. Among them, compound 29 particularly appears as a valuable radical and NO scavenger, a Cu(II) and Fe(II) chelating agent and exhibits moderate betaA aggregation inhibition properties. These activities, associated to a good predictive bioavailability and a lack of cytotoxicity, design it as a promising hit for further in vivo investigation.
