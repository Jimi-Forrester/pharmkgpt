37090957|t|Distinguishing Semantic Variant Primary Progressive Aphasia from Alzheimer's Disease.
37090957|a|The differentiation of semantic variant primary progressive aphasia from dementia and Alzheimer's disease can be difficult, particularly when the semantic anomia is pronounced. This report describes a patient who presented with complaints of memory loss and proved to have prominent semantic loss of all types of nouns, common and proper, concrete and abstract, yet continued to live independently and maintain his activities of daily living. The evaluation was consistent for semantic variant primary progressive aphasia with degradation of semantic knowledge and focal anterior temporal atrophy and hypometabolism. This report summarizes the literature and discusses the differential diagnosis of this disorder from Alzheimer's disease and related dementias.
