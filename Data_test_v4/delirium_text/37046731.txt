37046731|a|Improved serological biomarkers are needed for the early detection, risk stratification and treatment surveillance of patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). We performed an exploratory study using advanced, highly specific, DNA-aptamer-based serum proteomics (SOMAscan, 1305-plex) to identify distinct proteomic changes in patients with OSCC pre- vs. post-resection and compared to healthy controls. A total of 63 significantly differentially expressed serum proteins (each p < 0.05) were found that could discriminate between OSCC and healthy controls with 100% accuracy. Furthermore, 121 proteins were detected that were significantly altered between pre- and post-resection sera, and 12 OSCC-associated proteins reversed to levels equivalent to healthy controls after resection. Of these, 6 were increased and 6 were decreased relative to healthy controls, highlighting the potential relevance of these proteins as OSCC tumor markers. Pathway analyses revealed potential pathophysiological mechanisms associated with OSCC. Hence, quantitative proteome analysis using SOMAscan technology is promising and may aid in the development of defined serum marker assays to predict tumor occurrence, progression and recurrence in OSCC, and to guide personalized therapies.
