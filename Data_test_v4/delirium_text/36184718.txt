36184718|t|Global Scientific Research Landscape on Aluminum Toxicology.
36184718|a|This study aimed to identify the landscape of current aluminum toxicity based on knowledge mapping of the 100 most-cited articles on toxicological aspects of aluminum in biological organisms. The research was searched in the Web of Science Core Collection (WoS-CC) with publications between 1945 and 2022. Data regarding authorship, title, journal, year of publication, citation count, country, keywords, study design, and research hotspots were extracted and all elected articles were analyzed. Our results showed that among the articles selected, literature review and in vivo studies were the most common study designs. The USA and England were found as the countries with most publications. Alzheimer's disease (AD), aluminum, and neurotoxicity were found as the most frequent keywords. The articles most cited in world literature suggested that aluminum exposure is associated with Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease (PD), dialysis encephalopathy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, neurodegeneration changes, cognitive impairment, such as bone damage, oxidative alterations, and cytotoxicity.
