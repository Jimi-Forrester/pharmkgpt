37682140|t|MRI measurements of brain hippocampus volume in relation to mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis.
37682140|a|BACKGROUND: This is the first meta-analysis conducted to compare the hippocampal volume measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in healthy normal subjects, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer disease (AD), and to analyze the relationship between hippocampal volume changes and MCI and AD. METHODS: English literatures published from January 2004 to December 2006 were extracted from PubMed, Embase, Wanfang Medical, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure databases. Statistical analysis was carried out with Stata/SE 16.0 software. RESULTS: The smaller the volume of the hippocampus measured by MRI, the more severe the cognitive impairment or AD. Different MRI post-measurement correction methods have different measurement results: Left hippocampal volume measured by MRI Raw volume method is negatively correlated with MCI and AD (OR [odds ratio] = 0.58, 95%CI [confidence interval]: 0.42, 0.75) right hippocampal volume measured was not associated with MCI OR AD (OR = 0.87, 95%CI: 0.56, 1.18); left hippocampal volume measured by MRI total intracranial volume (TIV) Correction was not associated with MCI and AD (OR = 0.90, 95%CI: 0.62, 1.19), measured right hippocampal volume was not associated with MCI OR AD (OR = 0.81, 95%CI: 0.49, 1.12); left hippocampal volume measured by MRI TIV Correction was not associated with MCI and AD (OR = 0.90, 95%CI: 0.62, 1.19), measured right hippocampus volume was negatively associated with MCI and AD (OR = 0.49, 95%CI: 0.35, 0.62). CONCLUSION: The shrinkage of hippocampus volume is closely related to MCI and AD. MRI measurement of hippocampus volume is not only an auxiliary diagnostic tool for MCI and AD, but also a good prognosis assessment tool.
