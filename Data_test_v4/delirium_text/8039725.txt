8039725|t|Alzheimer's disease: a comprehensive approach to patient management.
8039725|a|Despite advances in our understanding of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the diagnosis is still made from the clinical history and assessment of cognitive function. The physical, neurologic exam, and laboratory testing help you look for any other condition that may be contributing to the dementia. Once the diagnosis is made, your role becomes that of a resource to the patient and family. Drug therapies may be needed to manage AD-related depression, sleep/wake cycle alterations, and aggressive behaviors. Some patients with mild to moderate cognitive deficits may be candidates for tacrine or enrollment in clinical trials of experimental therapies. Community resources, advocacy, and driving safety should be discussed with each patient and his/her family.
