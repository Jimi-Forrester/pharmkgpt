31175580|t|Melatonin Receptors Agonistic Activities of Phenols from Gastrodia elata.
31175580|a|Gastrodia elata is a famous traditional Chinese herb with medicinal and edible application. In this study, three new polybenzyls, gastropolybenzylols G-I (1-3) were isolated from the EtOAc extract of G. elata. Their structures were identified by extensive spectroscopic analyses involving HRESIMS, UV, IR, 1D and 2D NMR. Compound 1 showed agonistic effects on MT1 and MT2 receptors with agonistic rates of 55.91+-4.84% and 165.13+-5.65% at the concentration of 0.5 mM, respectively, and an EC50 value of 76.24 muM on MT2 receptor.
