31755298|t|The Turkish Version of the Telephone Cognitive Screen for Detecting Cognitive Impairment in Older Adults.
31755298|a|The ability to screen Turkish-speaking older adults for cognitive impairment by phone is lacking. The aim of this study was to translate the existing version of the telephone cognitive screen (T-CogS) into Turkish version (T-CogS-TR) and evaluate its reliability and validity in community-dwelling older adults. We prospectively recruited 104 community-dwelling participants with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) and healthy controls. The T-CogS-TR was administered twice via telephone at home, first within 3 days of an in-person administration and again 4 weeks later. We observed acceptable internal consistency (Cronbach alpha coefficient = 0.738) and internal reliability. The test-retest reliability was excellent. The T-CogS-TR demonstrated significant correlations with Instrumental Activities of Daily Living, Mini-Mental State Examination, Clock-Drawing Test, and Clinician Dementia Rating (P's < .0001). The cutoff value of <=22 exhibited sensitivity of 96.8%, specificity of 90.2%, positive predictive value of 93.9%, and negative predictive value of 94.9%. The T-CogS-TR can be useful as a valid and reliable tool for detecting AD in Turkish elderly patients. Also, this tool may be considered suitable for patients who need more frequent follow-up and cannot easily return to in-person visits.
