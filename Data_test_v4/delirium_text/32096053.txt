32096053|t|Dementia Therapy Targeting Tau.
32096053|a|Tau is a microtubule-associated tau proteins but it has also non-microtubular functions. It aggregates in Alzheimer's disease and many neurodegenerative disorders referred to as tauopathies. Such aggregation may result from mutations on the tau gene, MAPT, dysregulation in alternative splicing, post-translational modifications or truncation. This final chapter addresses some of the various researches on a therapeutic potential around the tau protein and its gene, MAPT. Many therapeutic strategies are ongoing but they are hampered by the lack of knowledge on tau physiological functions.
