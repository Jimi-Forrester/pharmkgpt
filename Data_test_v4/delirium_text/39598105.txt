39598105|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder that presents a significant health concern, often leading to substantial cognitive decline among older adults. A prominent feature of AD is progressive dementia, which eventually disrupts daily functioning and the ability to live independently. A major challenge in addressing AD is its prolonged pre-symptomatic phase, which makes early detection difficult. Moreover, the disease's complexity and the inefficiency of current diagnostic methods impede the development of targeted therapies. Therefore, there is an urgent need to enhance diagnostic methodologies for detection and treating AD even before clinical symptoms appear. Exosomes are nanoscale biovesicles secreted by cells, including nerve cells, into biofluids. These exosomes play essential roles in the central nervous system (CNS) by facilitating neuronal communication and thus influencing major physiological and pathological processes. Exosomal cargo, particularly microRNAs (miRNAs), are critical mediators in this cellular communication, and their dysregulation affects various pathological pathways related to neurodegenerative diseases, including AD. This review discusses the significant roles of exosomal miRNAs in the pathological mechanisms related to AD, focusing on the promising use of exosomal miRNAs as diagnostic biomarkers and targeted therapeutic interventions for this devastating disease.
