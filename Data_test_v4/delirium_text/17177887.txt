17177887|t|Convenient method for monitoring Abeta aggregation by quartz-crystal microbalance.
17177887|a|We have found that a quartz-crystal microbalance is a facile and useful tool for detecting the specific aggregation of the amyloid-beta peptides responsible for Alzheimer's disease. This method greatly reduces the time and samples (corresponds to 1 Hz frequency decrease per 30 pg mass increase on a 4.9 mm(2) electrode) that are needed in the aggregation assay, and is also applicable to molecular interactions between smaller amyloid-beta fragment peptides such as the pentapeptide KLVFF.
