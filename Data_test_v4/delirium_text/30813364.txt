30813364|t|Simultaneous Quantification of L-arginine and Monosaccharides during Fermentation: An Advanced Chromatography Approach.
30813364|a|Increasing demand for L-arginine by the food and pharmaceutical industries has sparked the search for sustainable ways of producing it. Microbial fermentation offers a suitable alternative; however, monitoring of arginine production and carbon source uptake during fermentation, requires simple and reliable quantitative methods compatible with the fermentation medium. Two methods for the simultaneous quantification of arginine and glucose or xylose are described here: high-performance anion-exchange chromatography coupled to integrated pulsed amperometric detection (HPAEC-IPAD) and reversed-phase ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography combined with charged aerosol detection (RP-UHPLC-CAD). Both were thoroughly validated in a lysogeny broth, a minimal medium, and a complex medium containing corn steep liquor. HPAEC-IPAD displayed an excellent specificity, accuracy, and precision for arginine, glucose, and xylose in minimal medium and lysogeny broth, whereas specificity and accuracy for arginine were somewhat lower in medium containing corn steep liquor. RP-UHPLC-CAD exhibited high accuracy and precision, and enabled successful monitoring of arginine and glucose or xylose in all media. The present study describes the first successful application of the above chromatographic methods for the determination and monitoring of L-arginine amounts during its fermentative production by a genetically modified Escherichia coli strain cultivated in various growth media.
