38871799|a|The mechanism by which subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) leads to chronic neurologic deficits is unclear. One possibility is that blood activates microglia to drive inflammation that leads to synaptic loss and impaired brain function. Using the endovascular perforation model of SAH in rats, we investigated short-term effects on microglia together with long-term effects on EEG and neurologic function for up to 3 months. Within the first week, microglia were increased both at the site of injury and diffusely across the cortex (2.5-fold increase in SAH compared to controls, p = 0.012). Concomitantly, EEGs from SAH animals showed focal increases in slow wave activity and diffuse reduction in fast activity. When expressed as a fast-slow spectral ratio, there were significant interactions between group and time (p < 0.001) with less ipsilateral recovery over time. EEG changes were most pronounced during the first week and correlated with neurobehavioral impairment. In vitro, the blood product hemin was sufficient to increase microglia phagocytosis nearly six-fold (p = 0.032). Immunomodulatory treatment with fingolimod after SAH reduced microglia, improved neurological function, and increased survival. These findings, which parallel many of the EEG changes seen in patients, suggest that targeting neuroinflammation could reduce long-term neurologic dysfunction following SAH.
