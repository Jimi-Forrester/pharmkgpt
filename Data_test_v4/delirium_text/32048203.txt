32048203|a|BACKGROUND: Emergence delirium occurs in children during recovery from general anesthesia. The aim of the study was to examine the effects of mask and intravenous sevoflurane anesthesia induction on emergence delirium in children undergoing tonsillectomy with or without adenoidectomy. METHODS: This single-blinded, prospective, randomized clinical trial was conducted in the operating room and the post-operative recovery area at a university hospital. Sixty-seven children (aged 3-12 years) were randomly assigned to receive either mask induction (group M) or intravenous induction (group IV). Vascular access was provided in group M after 8% sevoflurane and 60% nitrous oxide in oxygen were given through a mask. In the IV cohort, an intravenous cannula was inserted prior to induction. The incidence of emergence delirium was assessed using the Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium (PAED) scale after arrival in the post-anesthesia care unit. Post-operative pain was assessed using the Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, and Consolability (FLACC) scale. RESULTS: PAED scores were significantly higher in group M at 5 min (group M = 12.2 +- 4.215, group IV = 9.1 +- 4.0; mean difference = 3.094, 95% CI [1.108; 5.081]; P = 0.003), at 15 min (group M = 8.0 +- 2.6, group IV = 5.1 +- 2.3; mean difference = 2.942, 95% CI [1.586-4.301]; P < 0.001), and at 30 min (group M = 5.1 +- 2.8, group IV = 2.5 +- 1.8; mean difference = 2.620, 95% CI [1.457; 3.783]; P < 0.001) than in group IV. The FLACC scale scores were similar between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Mask induction for pediatric patients undergoing tonsillectomy with or without adenoidectomy increased Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium scores more than intravenous induction.
