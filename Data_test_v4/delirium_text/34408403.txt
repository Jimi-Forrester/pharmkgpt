34408403|a|PURPOSE: Emerging evidence has indicated that oxidative stress (OS) contributes to periodontitis. Periodontal ligament cells (PDLCs) are important for the regeneration of periodontal tissue. Quercetin, which is extracted from fruits and vegetables, has strong antioxidant capabilities. However, whether and how quercetin affects oxidative damage in PDLCs during periodontitis remains unknown. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of quercetin on oxidative damage in PDLCs and alveolar bone loss in periodontitis and underlying mechanisms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The tissue block culture method was used to extract human PDLCs (hPDLCs). First, a cell counting kit 8 (CCK-8) assay was used to identify the optimal concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and quercetin. Subsequently, a 2,7-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) probe, RT-qPCR, Western blotting and other methods were used to explore the effects of quercetin on OS in hPDLCs and the underlying mechanism. Finally, quercetin was administered to mice with periodontitis through gavage, and the effect of quercetin on the level of OS and alveolar bone resorption in these mice was observed by immunofluorescence, microcomputed tomography (micro-CT), hematoxylin and eosin staining (H&E) staining and so on. RESULTS: Quercetin at 5 muM strongly activated NF-E2-related factor 2 (NRF2) signaling, alleviated oxidative damage and enhanced the antioxidant capacity of hPDLCs. In addition, quercetin reduced cellular senescence and protected the osteogenic ability of hPDLCs. Finally, quercetin activated NRF2 signaling in the periodontal ligaments, reduced the OS level of mice with periodontitis, and slowed the absorption of alveolar bone in vivo. CONCLUSION: Quercetin can increase the antioxidant capacity of PDLCs and reduce OS damage by activating the NRF2 signaling pathway, which alleviates alveolar bone loss in periodontitis.
