38539607|t|Clinical Potential of Transcranial Focused Ultrasound for Neurorehabilitation in Pediatric Cancer Survivors.
38539607|a|Cancer survivors are at a high risk for treatment-related late effects, particularly neurocognitive impairment in the attention and executive function domains. These can be compounded in pediatric populations still undergoing neural development, which has increased interest in survivorship studies and neurorehabilitation approaches to mitigate these effects. Cognitive training regimens have shown promise as a therapeutic intervention for improving cognitive function. Therapist-guided and computerized training programs with adaptive paradigms have been successfully implemented in pediatric populations, with positive outcomes on attention and working memory. Another interventional approach is neuromodulation to alter plasticity. Transcranial electrical stimulation can modulate cortical surface activity, and cranial nerve stimulation alters autonomic activity in afferent brainstem pathways. However, they are more systemic in nature and have diffuse spatial targeting. Transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) modulation overcomes these limitations with high spatial specificity and the ability to target deeper brain regions. In this review, we discuss the efficacy of tFUS for modulating specific brain regions and its potential utility to augment cognitive training programs as a complementary intervention.
