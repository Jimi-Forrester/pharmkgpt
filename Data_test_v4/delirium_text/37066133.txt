37066133|t|Severe Abdominal Pain as a Presentation of Lead Poisoning: A Case Presentation.
37066133|a|Background: Lead poisoning is a rare but serious disease. The clinical manifestations of lead poisoning are various and nonspecific, such as abdominal pain, headache, dizziness, nightmare, fatigue and so on. Rapid diagnosis of lead poisoning is challenging because it does not have special symptoms and the morbidity is very low. Case Presentation: A 31-year-old woman presented with epigastric discomfort without any obvious cause. The patient was diagnosed with lead poisoning, as the blood levels of heavy metals were detected and the lead was 463.17 microg/L, which was very high (normal value was less than 100 microg/L). The patient was treated with intravenous drip of calcium sodium edentate and got better. The patient achieved good recovery and there was no recurrence. Conclusion: Lead poisoning is a rare disease and easy to be misdiagnosed as acute abdomen disease when present with abdominal pain. Lead poisoning should be considered when common causes of abdominal pain are excluded, especially patients with anemia and abnormal liver function. The diagnosis of lead poisoning is mainly replied on the blood or urine lead concentrations. Then we should firstly cut off the contact with lead and use metal complexing agent to facilitate lead excretion.
