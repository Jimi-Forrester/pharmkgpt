36997928|t|Association between preoperative anxiety and postoperative delirium in older patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
36997928|a|BACKGROUND: Postoperative delirium (POD) is a common postoperative complication associated with multiple adverse consequences on patient outcomes and higher medical expenses. Preoperative anxiety has been suggested as a possible precipitating factor for the development of POD. As such, we aimed to explore the association between preoperative anxiety and POD in older surgical patients. METHODS: Electronic databases including MEDLINE (via PubMed), EMBASE (via Embase.com), Web of Science Core Collection, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL Complete; via EBSCOhost) and clinical trial registries were systematically searched to identify prospective studies examining preoperative anxiety as a risk factor for POD in older surgical patients. We used Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist for Cohort Studies to assess the quality of included studies. The association between preoperative anxiety and POD was summarized with odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using DerSimonian-Laird random-effects meta-analysis. RESULTS: Eleven studies were included (1691 participants; mean age ranging between 63.1-82.3 years). Five studies used a theoretical definition for preoperative anxiety, with the Anxiety subscale of Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS-A) as the instrument being most often used. When using dichotomized measures and within the HADS-A subgroup analysis, preoperative anxiety was significantly associated with POD (OR = 2.17, 95%CI: 1.01-4.68, I2 = 54%, Tau2 = 0.4, n = 5; OR = 3.23, 95%CI: 1.70-6.13, I2 = 0, Tau2 = 0, n = 4; respectively). No association was observed when using continuous measurements (OR = 0.99, 95%CI: 0.93-1.05, I2 = 0, Tau2 = 0, n = 4), nor in the subgroup analysis of STAI-6 (six-item version of state scale of Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, OR = 1.07, 95%CI: 0.93-1.24, I2 = 0, Tau2 = 0, n = 2). We found the overall quality of included studies to be moderate to good. CONCLUSIONS: An unclear association between preoperative anxiety and POD in older surgical patients was found in our study. Given the ambiguity in conceptualization and measurement instruments used for preoperative anxiety, more research is warranted in which a greater emphasis should be placed on how preoperative anxiety is operationalized and measured.
