32867843|a|Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is essential for the development and function of human neurons, therefore it is a promising target for neurodegenerative disorders treatment. Here, we studied BDNF-based electrostatic complex with dendrimer nanoparticles encapsulated in polyethylene glycol (PEG) in neurotoxin-treated, differentiated neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells, a model of neurodegenerative mechanisms. PEG layer was adsorbed at dendrimer-protein core nanoparticles to decrease their cellular uptake and to reduce BDNF-other proteins interactions for a prolonged time. Cytotoxicity and confocal microscopy analysis revealed PEG-ylated BDNF-dendrimer nanoparticles can be used for continuous neurotrophic factor delivery to the neurotoxin-treated cells over 24 h without toxic effect. We offer a reliable electrostatic route for efficient encapsulation and controlled transport of fragile therapeutic proteins without any covalent cross-linker; this could be considered as a safe drug delivery system. Understanding the polyvalent BDNF interactions with dendrimer core nanoparticles offers new possibilities for design of well-ordered protein drug delivery systems.
