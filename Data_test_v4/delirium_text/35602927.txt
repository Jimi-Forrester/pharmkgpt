35602927|t|Rehabilitation Strategies for Cognitive and Neuropsychiatric Manifestations of COVID-19.
35602927|a|Purpose of Review: Extrapulmonary manifestations of COVID-19 are abundant, including after recovery of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. This review seeks to explore the cognitive and neuropsychiatric manifestations of COVID-19 and post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC), including Long COVID syndromes. Furthermore, the review will discuss rehabilitation strategies for the emerging neurological consequences of COVID-19 to help those experiencing long-term effects of COVID-19. Recent Findings: There is emerging evidence depicting the neural involvement of COVID-19. Health priorities have shifted from understanding pathogenesis and treatment of pulmonary symptoms to targeting the acute and chronic sequelae of COVID-19, including cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms. The sequelae of COVID-19 often co-occur with other medical problems and is best managed by assessment and care across multiple disciplines. Symptoms following infection are similar to those found by other syndromes and disorders that disrupt the central nervous system. Summary: The acute and chronic sequelae of COVID-19 have become major targets of current health care providers given its significant public health impact, inclusive of cognitive and neuropsychiatric sequelae. Assessment and referral to rehabilitation based on each individual's needs and symptoms can decrease morbidity and improve quality of life.
