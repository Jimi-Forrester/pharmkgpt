37212120|t|Exercise for Preventing Falls in People with Dementia: Time to Work Together.
37212120|a|Since the last two decades, many systematic reviews and meta-analyses found contradicting results on the effect of exercise in reducing falls in people with dementia. The recently published systematic review in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease found positive results in reducing falls in only two studies. The authors conclude that insufficient data remains in reducing the number of falls by exercise interventions. This commentary focuses on interdisciplinary approaches that could reduce the number of falls in this vulnerable population.
