36288306|t|LC3-associated endocytosis and the functions of Rubicon and ATG16L1.
36288306|a|LC3-associated endocytosis (LANDO) is a noncanonical function of the autophagy machinery, in which LC3 (microtubule-associated protein light chain) is conjugated to rab5-positive endosomes, using a portion of the canonical autophagy pathway. LANDO was initially discovered in a murine model of Alzheimer's disease as a critical regulator of amyloid-beta receptor recycling in microglial cells, playing a protective role against neuronal loss and memory impairment. Recent evidence suggests an emerging role of LANDO in cytokine receptor signaling and innate immunity. Here, we discuss the regulation of two crucial effectors of LANDO, Rubicon and ATG16L1, and their impact on endocytosis, autophagy, and phagocytosis.
