7312098|t|Choline chloride fails to improve cognition of Alzheimer's disease.
7312098|a|Seven mildly to moderately demented patients with Alzheimer's disease were treated with either placebo or choline chloride (50, 100 and 200 mg/kg/24 hrs) in a double blind, crossover study. Detailed psychometric analysis was carried out at the end of each two-week period of drug or placebo administration. No subjects showed significant overall improvement at any dose level despite more than a doubling of the baseline plasma choline level.
