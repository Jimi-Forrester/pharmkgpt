39731590|a|BACKGROUND: Little is known about how younger and older hospitalized patients differ with respect to reasons for admission, comorbidities, diagnostics, treatment and intercurrent problems. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to compare the previously named characteristics in the clinical profile of patients > 90 years old (nonagenarians) with a control group of patients 70-75 years old admitted to an emergency hospital department for internal medicine and cardiology. MATERIAL AND METHOD: The study included all consecutive nonagenarians and gender-matched control patients who were admitted during 2011. The reason for admission, comorbidities, diagnostics, treatment, intercurrent problems and discharge medication were taken from the patient records. Data on 8-year mortality were obtained by comparison of the death data. RESULTS: Nonagenarians (n = 117; 81 females) had a mean age of 92 +- 2.5 years and the control patients 72 +- 1.6 years. Nonagenarians were hospitalized more often because of neurological symptoms (19% vs. 7%), suffered more from kidney failure (85% vs. 67%), heart failure (35% vs. 21%), malignancies (29% vs. 8%), dementia (28% vs. 4%) and stroke (15% vs. 6%), developed confusion more often (27% vs. 7%) and fell more often (15% vs. 0%) than control patients. Control patients had a higher body mass index (29 +- 5.3 vs. 24 +- 4.1). Nonagenarians received fewer diagnostic measures (1.6 vs. 2.3), more often intravenous fluid (77% vs. 51%), diuretics (31% vs. 18%) and physiotherapy (24% vs. 8%). Polypharmacy (> 5 medications) in the discharge letter was frequent in both groups (67% vs. 75%). The yearly mortality of the nonagenarians was 27% and of the control group 6%. CONCLUSION: Acute internal diseases in nonagenarians are frequently manifested with neurological symptoms. In hospitalized nonagenarians, prevention of falls and delirium are of clinical relevance. Polypharmacy is a relevant problem in nonagenarians as well as in control patients.
