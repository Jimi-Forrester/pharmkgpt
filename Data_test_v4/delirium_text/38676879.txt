38676879|t|Products of Selenite/Thiols Interaction Have Reducing Properties, Cleave Plasmid DNA and Decrease Rat Blood Pressure and Tension of Rat Mesenteric Artery.
38676879|a|Selenium compounds exert their antioxidant activity mostly when the selenium atom is incorporated into selenoproteins. In our work, we tested the possibility that selenite itself interacts with thiols to form active species that have reducing properties. Therefore, we studied the reduction of 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,5-dihydro-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1H-imidazol-1-yloxy-3-oxide radical ( cPTIO), damage of plasmid DNA (pDNA), modulation of rat hemodynamic parameters and tension of isolated arteries induced by products of interaction of selenite with thiols. We found that the products of selenite interaction with thiols had significant reducing properties that could be attributed mainly to the selenide and that selenite had catalytic properties in the access of thiols. The potency of thiols to reduce  cPTIO in the interaction with selenite was cysteine > homocysteine > glutathione reduced > N-acetylcysteine. Thiol/selenite products cleaved pDNA, with superoxide dismutase enhancing these effects suggesting a positive involvement of superoxide anion in the process. The observed  cPTIO reduction and pDNA cleavage were significantly lower when selenomethionine was used instead of selenite. The products of glutathione/selenite interaction affected several hemodynamic parameters including rat blood pressure decrease. Notably, the products relaxed isolated mesenteric artery, which may explain the observed decrease in rat blood pressure. In conclusion, we found that the thiol/selenite interaction products exhibited significant reducing properties which can be used in further studies of the treatment of pathological conditions caused by oxidative stress. The results of decreased rat blood pressure and the tension of mesenteric artery may be perspective in studies focused on cardiovascular disease and their prevention.
