METHODS: We conducted focus groups and interviews of hospitalists, anesthesiologists, and nurses using a semi-structured approach. We rigorously analyzed transcribed data using a constant comparative method. RESULTS: We conducted six focus groups and 14 interviews. Participants included 20 hospitalists, 9 anesthesiologists, and 21 nurses. Clinicians identified three communication approaches as effective when communicating with family of delirium patients: Provide reassurance, educate families, and engage in family-centered communication. CONCLUSION: In communicating with families of patients with post-operative delirium, clinicians work to reassure and educate families using family-centered communication. Different approaches are used by different types of clinicians to accomplish this goal. Clinicians recognized the importance of involving family members in the patients' recovery. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Though clinically common and familiar to clinicians, delirium may be a new diagnosis for family members and thus compassion and education are vital. Due to the different clinical roles, education may be different for each discipline.
