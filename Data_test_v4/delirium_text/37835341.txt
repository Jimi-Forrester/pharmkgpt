37835341|t|Free Radical-Mediated Grafting of Natural Polysaccharides Such as Chitosan, Starch, Inulin, and Pectin with Some Polyphenols: Synthesis, Structural Characterization, Bioactivities, and Applications-A Review.
37835341|a|Polyphenols and polysaccharides are very important natural products with special physicochemical properties and extensive biological activities. Recently, polyphenol-polysaccharide conjugates have been synthesized to overcome the limitations of polysaccharides and broaden their application range. Grafted copolymers are produced through chemical coupling, enzyme-mediated, and free radical-mediated methods, among which the free radical-induced grafting reaction is the most cost-effective, ecofriendly, safe, and plausible approach. Here, we review the grafting reactions of polysaccharides mediated by free radicals with various bioactive polyphenols, such as gallic acid (GA), ferulic acid (FA), and catechins. A detailed introduction of the methods and their mechanisms for free radical-mediated grafting is given. Structural characterization methods of the graft products, including thin-layer chromatography (TLC), ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis, and X-ray diffraction (XRD) are introduced. Furthermore, the biological properties of polyphenol-polysaccharide conjugates are also presented, including antioxidant, antibacterial, antidiabetic, and neuroprotection activities, etc. Moreover, the potential applications of polyphenol-polysaccharide conjugates are described. Finally, the challenges and research prospects of graft products are summarized.
