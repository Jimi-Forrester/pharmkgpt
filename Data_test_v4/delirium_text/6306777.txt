6306777|a|The effectiveness of sultopride in acute psychiatric syndromes with prominent agitation was tested in patients seen in the emergency department of a general hospital. Among 32 patients, 26 were given a single injection of 200 mg and 6 had two injections. Seven items were evaluated at ten minute intervals for one hour. Results showed excellent control of agitation and anxiety but little effect on delirium, hallucinations and depression. Furthermore, the patients' unwillingness to be cared for can be overcome by this agent and diagnosis, therapy and orientation can be established. These good results are partly achieved as early as 20 minutes after the injection. Psychomotor agitation thus appears to be the choice indication of sultopride.
