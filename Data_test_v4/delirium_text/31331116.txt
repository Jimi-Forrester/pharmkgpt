31331116|t|Multicomponent Synthesis of Polyphenols and their in vitro Evaluation as Potential beta-Amyloid Aggregation Inhibitors.
31331116|a|While plant polyphenols possess a variety of biological properties, exploration of chemical diversity around them is still problematic. Here, an example of application of the Ugi multicomponent reaction to the combinatorial assembly of artificial, yet "natural-like", polyphenols is presented. The synthesized compounds represent a second-generation library directed to the inhibition of beta-amyloid protein aggregation. Chiral enantiopure compounds, and polyphenol-beta-lactam hybrids have been prepared too. The biochemical assays have highlighted the importance of the key pharmacophores in these compounds. A lead for inhibition of aggregation of truncated protein AbetapE3-42 was selected.
