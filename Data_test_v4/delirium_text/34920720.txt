34920720|a|BACKGROUND: Advancements in the field of oncological therapies during the last decades have led to a significantly prolonged survival of cancer patients. This has led to an increase in the incidence of spinal metastases. The purpose of this study was to assess risk factors for wound-related complications after surgical stabilization of spinal metastases with a special focus on the effect of postoperative RT and its timing. METHODS: Patients who had been treated for metastatic spine disease by surgical stabilization followed by radiotherapy between 01/2012 and 03/2019 were included and a retrospective chart review was performed. RESULTS: Of 604 patients who underwent stabilizing surgery for spinal metastases, 237 patients (mean age 66 years, SD 11) with a mean follow-up of 11 months (SD 7) were eligible for further analysis. Forty-one patients (17.3%) had wound-related complications, 32 of them before and 9 after beginning of the RT. Revision surgery was necessary in 26 patients (11.0%). Body weight (p = 0.021), obesity (p = 0.018), ASA > 2 (p = 0.001), and start of radiation therapy within 21 days after surgery (p = 0.047) were associated with an increased risk for wound complications. Patients with chemotherapy within 3 weeks of surgery (12%) were more likely to have a wound-related surgical revision (p = 0.031). CONCLUSION: Body weight, obesity and ASA > 2 were associated with an increased risk for wound complications. Patients with chemotherapy within 3 weeks of the surgery were more likely to have a wound-related revision surgery. Patients who had begun radiation therapy within 21 days after surgery were more likely to have a wound complication compared to patients who waited longer.
