12968400|a|The peripheral nervous system is often involved in patients with mixed cryoglobulinemia (MC), while there are few reports of central nervous system involvement. We describe a case of HCV-related type II MC with peripheral and central nervous system involvement. A 61-year-old woman, suffering from flaccid tetraparesis, was referred to our department because of an increasing disability. The presence of delirium prompted us to also investigate the central nervous system. MMSE, EEG, EMG, brain CT-scan, color-Doppler of neck vessels, retinal fluorangiography and brain MRI were performed. These investigations suggested a cerebral vasculitis. The finding of very low C4 serum levels, together with high rheumatoid factor serum levels, suggested the search for cryoglobulins. The laboratory findings showed a HCV-related type II (IgMk) MC. A marked improvement of symptoms and of laboratory data was obtained by treatment with methylprednisolone + cyclophosphamide.
