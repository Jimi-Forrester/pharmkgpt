18021208|t|The coming of age of a joint elderly medicine-psychiatric ward: 18 years' experience.
18021208|a|INTRODUCTION: There is a large population of elderly medical inpatients with co-existent medical and mental health disorders who pose a significant management challenge for medical, nursing and allied staff. Our hospital has a joint elderly medicine-psychiatry unit to cater for this patient group; this article reviews how this unit was set up and presents a representative sample of inpatients. RESULTS: The mean age was 81 years with a female preponderance. The mean length of stay was 44 days. The commonest medical conditions were cerebrovascular disease, urinary tract infections, chest infections and falls. The commonest mental health diagnoses were cognitive impairment, delirium and depression. The mortality rate was 21%; of the remainder, 55% were discharged to long-term care, 40% returned home and 5% were transferred to the local psychiatric hospital. DISCUSSION: This cohort of elderly patients has complex medical, nursing and therapy needs in addition to complex discharge planning needs. Our unit has a shared care approach, with joint responsibility shared by a consultant in Medicine for the Elderly and a Consultant in Old Age Psychiatry. This, in combination with a multidisciplinary team approach, provides an effective means of delivering care to this patient group. CONCLUSION: A joint elderly medicine-old age psychiatry ward provides a high standard of care for elderly patients with co-existent physical and mental health needs. We hope that the information presented in this article will be of use to those hoping to set up a similar unit in their own hospitals.
