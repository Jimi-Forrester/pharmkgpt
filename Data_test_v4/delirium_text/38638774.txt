38638774|t|The Efficacy of the Combination of Continuous Femoral Nerve Block and Intravenous Parecoxib on Rehabilitation in Patients Undergoing Total Knee Arthroplasty: A Double-Blind, Randomized Clinical Trial.
38638774|a|BACKGROUND AND AIM: The optimal strategy for the management of postoperative pain after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) remains challenging, while its treatment is crucial to increase patients' outcomes. This study aimed to investigate the effects of parecoxib as add-on therapy, in a standard postoperative pain management protocol, represented by the continuous femoral nervous block. We studied its influence on rehabilitation indices and pain scores in patients undergoing TKA. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This is a single-center, prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. All patients were operated with the use of subarachnoid anesthesia, and divided into two groups for postoperative analgesia. Both groups received a continuous femoral nerve block. One of the groups received intravenous parecoxib, while the other received a placebo. The primary investigated outcome was the range of motion (ROM). Recordings were noted at different times postoperatively. Bromage score (BS), visual analog scale (VAS), and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) were also studied. RESULTS: A total of 90 patients were included and analyzed. ROM was significantly better (p<0.001) and pain scores were significantly lower (p=0.007) in the parecoxib group. No statistically significant difference was found with regard to BS between the two groups. A significant correlation was found between ROM and VAS pain scores at 12 hours (p=0.02), while ROM was inversely correlated with STAI postoperatively. CONCLUSIONS: The use of intravenous parecoxib is effective in improving rehabilitation indices and provides decreased postoperative pain scores after TKA.
