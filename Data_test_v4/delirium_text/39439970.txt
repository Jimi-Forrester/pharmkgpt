39439970|a|Aotearoa New Zealand's population is ageing. Increasing life expectancy is accompanied by increases in prevalence of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and ageing-related disorders. The multicentre Dementia Prevention Research Clinic longitudinal study aims to improve understanding of AD and dementia in Aotearoa, in order to develop interventions that delay or prevent progression to dementia. Comprising research clinics in Auckland, Christchurch and Dunedin, this multi-disciplinary study involves community participants who undergo biennial investigations informed by international protocols and best practice: clinical, neuropsychological, neuroimaging, lifestyle evaluations, APOE genotyping, blood collection and processing. A key research objective is to identify a 'biomarker signature' that predicts progression from mild cognitive impairment to AD. Candidate biomarkers include: blood proteins and microRNAs, genetic, neuroimaging and neuropsychological markers, health, cultural, lifestyle, sensory and psychosocial factors. We are examining a range of mechanisms underlying the progression of AD pathology (e.g. faulty blood-brain barrier, excess parenchymal iron, vascular dysregulation). This paper will outline key aspects of the Dementia Prevention Research Clinic's research, provide an overview of data collection, and a summary of 266 participants recruited to date. The national outreach of the clinics is a strength; the heart of the Dementia Prevention Research Clinics are its people.
