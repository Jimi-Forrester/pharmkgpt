31774942|a|AIM: Thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) is an astrocyte-derived synaptogenesis-related factor. It was previously reported to be increased by chronic treatment of electroconvulsive seizure, a model of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), in rat hippocampus. The aim of this study was to examine whether serum levels of TSP-1 are associated with depression and ECT. METHODS: Serum TSP-1 levels of major depressive disorder (MDD) patients (n = 36) and age- and gender-matched healthy controls (n = 36) were measured by TSP-1 ELISA. MDD patients were diagnosed according to the Diagnostics and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV-TR and underwent ECT. MDD patients were also analyzed for serum TSP-1 levels pre- and post-ECT. Evaluation of symptoms was obtained using the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. RESULTS: Serum TSP-1 levels showed significant decreases specific to female MDD patients. However, TSP-1 did not change pre- and post-ECT, did not correlate with symptoms, nor was not affected by the dose of antidepressants. CONCLUSION: Serum TSP-1 is a possible female-specific factor that reflects depressive trait, but not state.
