35056603|a|Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, is typically presented with acute symptoms affecting upper and lower respiratory systems. As the current pandemic progresses, COVID-19 patients are experiencing a series of nonspecific or atypical extra-pulmonary complications such as systemic inflammation, hypercoagulability state, and dysregulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). These manifestations often delay testing, diagnosis, and the urge to seek effective treatment. Although the pathophysiology of these complications is not clearly understood, the incidence of COVID-19 increases with age and the presence of pre-existing conditions. This review article outlines the pathophysiology and clinical impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on extra-pulmonary systems. Understanding the broad spectrum of atypical extra-pulmonary manifestations of COVID-19 should increase disease surveillance, restrict transmission, and most importantly prevent multiple organ-system complications.
