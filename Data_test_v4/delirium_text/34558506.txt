34558506|a|The clinical "gold standard" technique for attempting to restore function to nerves with a gap is to bridge the gap with sensory autografts. However, autografts induce good to excellent recovery only across short nerve gaps, in young patients, and when repairs are performed a short time post nerve trauma. Even under the best of conditions, < 50% of patients recover good recovery. Although many alternative techniques have been tested, none is as effective as autografts. Therefore, alternative techniques are required that increase the percentage of patients who recover function and the extent of their recovery. This paper examines the actions of lithium, and how it appears to trigger all the cellular and molecular events required to promote axon regeneration, and how both in animal models and clinically, lithium administration enhances both the extent of axon regeneration and neurological recovery. The paper proposes more extensive clinical testing of lithium for its ability and reliability to increase the extent of axon regeneration and functional recovery.
