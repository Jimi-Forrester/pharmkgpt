36030976|a|Biodegradable poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)(PLGA) nanoparticles have been used extensively in delivering drugs to target tissues due to their excellent biocompatibility. Evidence suggests that PLGA-conjugated drugs/agents can attenuate pathology in cellular/animal models of Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is initiated by increased level/aggregation of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide generated from amyloid precursor protein (APP). The beneficial effects were attributed to conjugated-drugs rather than to PLGA nanoparticles. Interestingly, we recently reported that PLGA without any drug/agent (native PLGA) can suppress Abeta aggregation/toxicity. However, very little is known about the internalization, subcellular localization or effects of PLGA in neurons. In this study, using primary mouse cortical neurons, we first showed that native PLGA is internalized by an energy-mediated clathrin-dependent/-independent pathway and is localized in endosomal-lysosomal-autophagic vesicles. By attenuating internalization, PLGA can protect neurons against Abeta-mediated toxicity. Additionally, PLGA treatment altered expression profiles of certain AD-associated genes and decreased the levels of APP, its cleaved products alpha-/beta-CTFs and Abeta peptides in mouse as well as iPSC-derived neurons from control and AD patients. Collectively, these results suggest that native PLGA not only protects neurons against Abeta-induced toxicity but also influences the expression of AD-related genes/proteins - highlighting PLGA's implication in normal and AD-related pathology.
