34842123|t|More than just anti-NMDAR: the many facets of autoimmune encephalitis.
34842123|a|This editorial expands on a Praxis article published by Beattie and colleagues in the trainees' section of this journal. The authors describe an interesting case of anti-N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (anti-NMDAR) encephalitis, outline the clinical presentation and make suggestions on ways to approach this rare disorder. Here we provide an overview of autoimmune conditions that result in the production of autoantibodies targeting central nervous system proteins mediating autoimmune encephalitis and offer a perspective on approaches to diagnosis and treatment.
