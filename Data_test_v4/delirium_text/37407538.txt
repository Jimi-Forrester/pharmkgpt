37407538|a|Parkinson's disease(PD)is the second most common neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer's disease,with high morbidity and high disability rate.Since the early symptoms of PD are not typical and often similar to those of normal aging or other diseases.It is easy to missed diagnosis and misdiagnosis,which seriously affects the diagnosis and treatment of this disease and aggravetes the burden on the patients' life.MicroRNAs(miRNA)are a class of endogenous non-coding RNAs that are involved in post-transcriptional regulation by binding to target messenger RNAs(mRNA).They are highly conserved,short,easy to obtain,and can stably exist in peripheral body fluids.They have been used as biomarkers for a variety of diseases.Recent studies have demonstrated that miRNA play an important role in the development of PD.This paper reviews the recent research progress of miR-7/124/155,three mature miRNA in PD,aiming to provide reference for clarifying the pathogenesis and guiding the diagnosis and treatment of PD.
