11333432|a|BACKGROUND: Although individuals with Down's syndrome (DS) are uniquely at risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, the diagnosis of dementia in DS is problematic because of the difficulty in detecting cognitive decline in individuals with pre-existing learning disability. AIM: To determine if dementia in DS is associated with Medial Temporal Lobe (MTL) atrophy as measured by temporal lobe-oriented CT scanning. METHOD: Ten individuals with DS who were experiencing functional decline had CT scans with temporal lobe-oriented views. All individuals were assessed for the presence of dementia according to modified DSM-IIIR criteria. The minimal thickness of the MTL, corrected for age-related atrophy was measured using a computer calipers at the level of the mid-brainstem by a radiologist blind to the dementia diagnosis. RESULTS: All six individuals who met modified DSM-IIIR criteria for dementia showed significant MTL atrophy. CONCLUSIONS: The utility of temporal lobe-oriented CT scanning as an adjunct to the diagnosis of dementia in DS appears promising and warrants further study.
