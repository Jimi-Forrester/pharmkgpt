35804216|t|Silent Brain Infarction, Delirium, and Cognition in Three Invasive Cardiovascular Procedures: a Systematic Review.
35804216|a|Silent brain infarctions (SBIs) are brain lesions noted on neuroimaging that are not associated with clinical symptoms. SBIs are associated with a number of vascular risk factors and are common following invasive cardiovascular procedures such as atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation, coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), and transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Although not eliciting signs of clinical stroke, SBIs are associated with increased frailty, and motor and mood features. Less is known, however, about the relationship between SBI, cognition, and delirium following invasive cardiac procedures and most investigations into these relationships have been reported in large-scale epidemiological studies. In the current paper, we conducted a systematic review to evaluate evidence of a relationship between SBI, delirium, and cognitive decline following CABG, AF ablation, and TAVR. Twenty studies met inclusion criteria. In general, our review identified conflicting results for each cardiac procedure, with some studies suggesting a relationship between SBI, cognitive impairment, and delirium, whereas others showed no relationship between SBI, cognitive impairment, and delirium. Potential reasons for this discrepancy as well as suggestions for future research are discussed.
