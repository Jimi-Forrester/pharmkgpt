37693630|t|Hybrid Amyloid Quantum Dot Nanoassemblies to Probe Neuroinflammatory Damage.
37693630|a|Various oligomeric species of amyloid-beta have been proposed to play different immunogenic roles in the cellular pathology of Alzheimer's Disease. However, investigating the role of a homogenous single oligomeric species has been difficult due to highly dynamic oligomerization and fibril formation kinetics that convert between many species. Here we report the design and construction of a quantum dot mimetic for larger spherical oligomeric amyloid species as an "endogenously" fluorescent proxy for this cytotoxic species to investigate its role in inducing inflammatory and stress response states in neuronal and glial cell types.
