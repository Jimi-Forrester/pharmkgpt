34563374|t|Neurocritical care for neurological incapacitated patients.
34563374|a|Admission to ICU for patients with long-term disease is always the result of a reflection for short and long term benefit. When the disease is about functional or cognitive autonomy, we have to think with ethical considerations to allow the patient to find acceptable quality of life after Intensive Care Unit (ICU). ICU complications through the prism of neurological incapacitated patients will be described. As neurodegenerative disorder like Parkinson's disease shares common points with delirium or sepsis associated encephalopathy (SAE), there is a theoretic link to think that ICU could worsen cognitive function among patients with neurodegenerative disorder (ND). However, clinical data are still very poor. Regarding long term sequelae after ICU stay and probable synergy between ICU and incapacitated patients to worsen their handicap, different angles should be considered when those patients are referred to ICU.
