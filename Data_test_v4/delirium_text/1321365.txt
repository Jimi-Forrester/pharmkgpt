1321365|a|Autoradiographic experiments were performed on brains of Siberian hamsters (Phodopus sungorus) injected with tritiated 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol. Nuclear labeling was prevented in the presence of excess unlabeled hormone. Strong nuclear concentration of radioactivity was observed in neurons of the nucleus basalis of Meynert, the medial septal nucleus, the nucleus of the diagonal band of Broca and the central amygdaloid group. The latter has been defined as consisting of the central nucleus of the amygdala, its extension into the sublenticular part of the substantia innominata of Reichert, and the lateral division of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. All these structures have been reported to be involved in memory and other cognitive processes, and to be affected by age-dependent neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. Corresponding localization of 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol receptor sites in these select basal forebrain nuclei of the Siberian hamster may implicate vitamin D (soltriol), the steroid hormone of sunlight, in memory processing.
