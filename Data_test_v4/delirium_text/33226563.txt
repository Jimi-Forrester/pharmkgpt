33226563|a|Depression and dementia are predicted to increase within aging global populations. Pathophysiological effects of phosphate toxicity, dysregulated amounts of accumulated phosphorus in body tissue, are under-investigated in association with stress, inflammation, depression, and dementia. A comparative analysis of concepts in cited sources from the research literature was used to synthesize novel themes exploring the disease-oriented neuroscience effects of phosphate toxicity. Phosphate toxicity is associated with activation of cellular stress response systems and inflammation. Cortisol released by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis responds to stress and inflammation associated with phosphate toxicity and depression. In a reciprocal interaction, phosphate toxicity is capable of harming adrenal gland function, possibly leading to adrenal insufficiency and depression. Furthermore, Alzheimer's disease is associated with hyperphosphorylated tau which self-assembles into neurofibrillary tangles from excessive amounts of phosphate in the brain and central nervous system. Future research should investigate dietary phosphate modification to reduce potential pathophysiological effects of phosphate toxicity in stress, inflammation, depression, and cognitive decline which affects global populations.
