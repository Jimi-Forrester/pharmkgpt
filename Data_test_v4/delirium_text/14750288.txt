14750288|t|[Acral skin necrosis in a patient with malaria].
14750288|a|A case of acral skin necrosis in a 21-year-old farm workman, associated with Plasmodium falciparum malaria is reported. Patient presented jaundice, disorientation and delirium, high parasitemia, hypoglycemia, anemia, low platelets, and dark necrotic maculae surrounded by an erythematous halo, circumscribed to toes. After malaria treatment, the clinical evolution was uneventful and the skin lesions also improved without sequels. The possibility that some of the skin changes, eventually observed in malaria patients, may be related with responses to Plasmodium infection is emphasized.
