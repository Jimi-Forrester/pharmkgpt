39100114|t|Systemic inflammatory markers and their association with Alzheimer's disease: A cross-sectional analysis.
39100114|a|Aim: To investigate the possible role of systemic inflammatory markers (interleukin; IL-6, C-reactive protein; CRP, and albumin levels) in the development of Alzheimer's dementia (AD) and also find their association with the severity of disease. Material and Methods: It was a cross-sectional study. Patients with Alzheimer's dementia (AD) and vascular dementia (VaD) from outpatient settings in tertiary care hospitals and non-demented controls (NDC) were recruited from the community. Individuals aged 50 years and older (n = 110) were included. Serum levels of IL-6, CRP, and albumin levels in patients with AD, VaD, and NDC were measured. The clinical Dementia Rating Scale was used for staging the severity of dementia. Serum levels of IL-6, CRP, and serum albumin were compared in study subjects and also analyzed with the severity of dementia in dementia subgroups. Results: Our main finding was that serum levels of IL-6 were significantly elevated in patients with AD and VaD (7.79 and 6.60) as compared to NDC (2.98) (P < 0.001). No significant difference in CRP or albumin levels was observed between the three groups. Serum IL-6 and CRP showed a positive correlation with the severity of AD, though the correlation was significant only for IL-6 (r = 0.777). The serum albumin levels showed a statistically significant negative correlation with the severity of AD (r > 0.3 but <0.5). Conclusion: The study demonstrates a notable association between systemic inflammatory markers, particularly IL-6, and the severity of AD, indicating their potential role in its pathogenesis. These findings suggest that targeting these markers could offer new insights into therapeutic strategies for AD.
