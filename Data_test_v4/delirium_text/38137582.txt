38137582|t|The Analysis of Multiple Outcomes between General and Regional Anesthesia in Hip Fracture Surgery: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.
38137582|a|Surgical interventions in hip fracture have been associated with multiple adverse events, including perioperative hypotension and mortality, making the choice of the anesthetic method for this procedure crucial. There is still no consensus on whether regional (RA) or general (GA) anesthesia should be used to maintain hemodynamic stability and more favorable outcomes. Therefore, this meta-analysis examines the differences between RA and GA groups in the incidence of mortality, intraoperative hypotension, and other intra- and postoperative complications. The comparison is essential given the rising global prevalence of hip fractures and the need to optimize anesthesia strategies for improved patient outcomes, particularly in an aging population. We followed PRISMA guidelines (PROSPERO #CRD42022320413). We conducted the search for studies published in English before March 2022 in PubMed, Google Scholar, and the Cochrane Library. We included RCTs that compared general and regional anesthesia in adult patients having hip fracture surgical interventions. The primary outcome was perioperative mortality. The secondary outcomes were peri- or postoperative complications and duration of hospital stay. We conducted a meta-analysis in RevMan (version 5.4). We examined the quality of the methodology with the Cochrane risk of bias 2 tool, while the quality of evidence was determined with GRADE. Fifteen studies with 4110 patients were included. Our findings revealed no significant difference between general and regional anesthesia in risk of perioperative mortality (RR = 1.42 [0.96, 2.10], p-value = 0.08), intraoperative complications, or duration of hospital length of stay. Our results suggest that regional anesthesia and general anesthesia have comparable safety and can be used as alternatives based on specific patient requirements.
