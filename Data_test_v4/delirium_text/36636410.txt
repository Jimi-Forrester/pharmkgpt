36636410|a|Background: Patients with lung cancer are more likely to have comorbidities [e.g., interstitial lung disease (ILD)], chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) and metastases that may affect dyspnea and the effectiveness and safety of opioids for dyspnea than other cancer types. Therefore, this study examined the effectiveness and safety of opioids for dyspnea, among the patients with lung cancer. Methods: The present study is a secondary analysis of a multicenter prospective observational study examining the effectiveness and safety of opioids for dyspnea in patients with cancer in Japan. For this secondary analysis, patients with lung cancer with a documented dyspnea Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) at baseline were included. The primary outcome was dyspnea NRS, and Integrated Palliative care Outcome Scale/Support Team Assessment Schedule (IPOS/STAS) scores change between baseline and 24 hours after baseline. As secondary outcomes, we investigated the predictors of opioid effectiveness for dyspnea improvement and adverse events (nausea, somnolence, and delirium). Results: This study analyzed 124 patients with lung cancer with known dyspnea NRS at baseline. The median age was 74, and the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 107 patients were 3-4. Both NRS and IPOS/STAS score of dyspnea significantly improved 24 hours after opioid initiation [-1.64, 95% confidence interval (CI): -2.12 to -1.17, P<0.001; -1.03; 95% CI: -1.21 to -0.85, P<0.001; respectively]. Moreover, the improvement of NRS score was greater than the minimal clinically important difference of 1 point. In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, ILD was significantly associated with a better improvement [(hazard ratio (HR): 3.39, 95% CI: 1.34-11.09, P=0.043]. Somnolence was the most common grade 3-4 adverse event (n=16), followed by delirium (n=9). Conclusions: Opioids were effective and safe for treating dyspnea in patients with lung cancer. Furthermore, lung cancer patients with ILD may benefit more from opioids.
