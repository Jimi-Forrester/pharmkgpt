35646648|t|XGBG: A Novel Method for Identifying Ovarian Carcinoma Susceptible Genes Based on Deep Learning.
35646648|a|Ovarian carcinomas (OCs) represent a heterogeneous group of neoplasms consisting of several entities with pathogenesis, molecular profiles, multiple risk factors, and outcomes. OC has been regarded as the most lethal cancer among women all around the world. There are at least five main types of OCs classified by the fifth edition of the World Health Organization of tumors: high-/low-grade serous carcinoma, mucinous carcinoma, clear cell carcinoma, and endometrioid carcinoma. With the improved knowledge of genome-wide association study (GWAS) and expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analyses, the knowledge of genomic landscape of complex diseases has been uncovered in large measure. Moreover, pathway analyses also play an important role in exploring the underlying mechanism of complex diseases by providing curated pathway models and information about molecular dynamics and cellular processes. To investigate OCs deeper, we introduced a novel disease susceptible gene prediction method, XGBG, which could be used in identifying OC-related genes based on different omics data and deep learning methods. We first employed the graph convolutional network (GCN) to reconstruct the gene features based on both gene feature and network topological structure. Then, a boosting method is utilized to predict OC susceptible genes. As a result, our model achieved a high AUC of 0.7541 and an AUPR of 0.8051, which indicates the effectiveness of the XGPG. Based on the newly predicted OC susceptible genes, we gathered and researched related literatures to provide strong support to the results, which may help in understanding the pathogenesis and mechanisms of the disease.
