26823711|a|Synapsin I is a neuronal phosphoprotein contained in the synaptic vesicles of mammalian central and peripheral nervous systems. It regulates both neurotransmitter release and synaptic formation. Variations in synapsin I expression in the brain have been reported to cause brain malfunction. In severe malaria, neurological complications, such as convulsion, delirium and coma, suggest abnormalities in the release of neurotransmitters. This study evaluated synapsin I expression in cerebral malaria (CM). An immunohistochemical method was used to study the semi-quantitative and qualitative expression of synapsin I in the brain of CM patients (10 cases) who died with Plasmodium falciparum, compared with non-cerebral malaria (NCM) (4 cases), and control brain tissues (5). Synapsin I was expressed in the gray matter of the cerebral cortex and the molecular layer of the cerebellum, as a diffusely dense precipitate pattern in the neuropil, with no immunoreactivity in the neurons, neuronal dendrites, glial cells, endothelial cells, and Purkinje cells. The findings were similarly demonstrated in CM, NCM, and control brain tissues. However, in the granular layer of the cerebellum, a significant increase in synapsin I expression was observed in the granule cells, and the glomerular synaptic complex, from the CM group, compared with the NCM, and control brain tissues (all P < 0.05). Parasitemia showed a positive correlation with synapsin I expression in the granule cells (on admission: Spearman's rho = 0.600, P = 0.023) (before death: Spearman's rho = 0.678, P = 0.008), and glomerular synaptic complex (before death: Spearman's rho = 0.571, P = 0.033). It was hypothesized that CM causes pre-synaptic excitation and eventually activation of synapsin I, leading to increased neurotransmitter release. Synapsin I inhibitor should be investigated further as a target for a therapeutic intervention to alleviate neurological symptoms in severe malaria.
