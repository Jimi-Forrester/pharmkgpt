34198733|t|Cathepsin D-Managing the Delicate Balance.
34198733|a|Lysosomal proteases play a crucial role in maintaining cell homeostasis. Human cathepsin D manages protein turnover degrading misfolded and aggregated proteins and favors apoptosis in the case of proteostasis disruption. However, when cathepsin D regulation is affected, it can contribute to numerous disorders. The down-regulation of human cathepsin D is associated with neurodegenerative disorders, such as neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis. On the other hand, its excessive levels outside lysosomes and the cell membrane lead to tumor growth, migration, invasion and angiogenesis. Therefore, targeting cathepsin D could provide significant diagnostic benefits and new avenues of therapy. Herein, we provide a brief overview of cathepsin D structure, regulation, function, and its role in the progression of many diseases and the therapeutic potentialities of natural and synthetic inhibitors and activators of this protease.
