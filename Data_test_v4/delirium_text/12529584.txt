12529584|t|[Mild Cognitive Impairment: potential therapeutics].
12529584|a|Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is an emerging concept used to describe memory decline and probably attention disturbances in otherwise intellectually intact individuals. MCI may be considered in 12 to 15 p. 100 of the cases as announcing an Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Although still speculative, the debate concerning the drugs susceptible to normalize symptoms of MCI or to stop conversion to AD must be raised. For that purpose, several long term clinical trials are running (antioxidants, nootropics, anticholinesterasics.) and new molecules in the pipe-line should be assessed in patients with the diagnosis of MCI.
