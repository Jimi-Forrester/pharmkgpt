23401757|a|Objectives and Methods. This was an observational study of the efficacy of short-term psychodynamic psychotherapy (STPP) in a sample of 35 (30 women and 5 men) patients with moderate-to-severe "male depression" (Gotland Scale for Male Depression (GSMD) >= 13) comorbid with unipolar mood disorder (dysthymia and major depression) or anxiety disorder. Outcome measures were GSMD and BHS (Beck Hopelessness Scale) score changes from baseline. Results. Patients had a strong response to STPP on the GSMD (estimated mean score change (+- SE) = -9.08 +- 2.74; P < 0.01; partial eta squared = 0.50), but not on the BHS (estimated mean score change (+- SE) = -0.92 +- 1.55; P = 0.57; partial eta squared   = 0.03). BHS score changes were significantly associated with GSMD score changes (Pearson's r = 0.56; P < 0.001), even when controlling for the severity of hopelessness at the baseline (partial r = 0.62; P < 0.001). Conclusions. STPP proved to be effective in patients suffering from "male depression" although hopelessness was only marginally reduced by this treatment which points to the need to better understand how STPP can be involved in the reduction of suicide risk.
