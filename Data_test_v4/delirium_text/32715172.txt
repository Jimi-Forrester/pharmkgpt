32715172|t|Endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair in a centenarian.
32715172|a|As the general population ages, there will be an increasing number of vascular patients in their 90s and older. However, geriatric patients have historically been turned down for abdominal aortic aneurysm repair despite high aneurysm-related mortality in the unrepaired. Herein, we describe the perioperative considerations and the successful, uncomplicated operative course of a 100-year-old woman who underwent an elective endovascular aortic aneurysm repair for an expanding 5.3-cm abdominal aortic aneurysm. Given a suitable patient, there is acceptable risk profile of an endovascular approach, even in centenarians.
