37671222|t|Outcomes of Cancer Patients Who Seek Outpatient Visits Despite Post-chemotherapy Decline.
37671222|a|INTRODUCTION: The medical needs of cancer patients are complex and increase with the disease's progression. However, Japan's aging population and increased medical needs have produced challenges like a shortage of hospital beds. Therefore, patients who have completed chemotherapy are recommended home-based care or referred to local palliative care facilities, especially when cancer treatment is no longer a viable option and outpatient visits become unfeasible. However, some patients still strive to continue outpatient visits, which could result in increased pain and possible urgent hospitalization. These patients may spend their final days in the hospital, which may not have been their desired outcome. Therefore, we examined the outcomes of patients who were recommended home-based care. METHODS: The study population comprised 34 cancer patients undergoing treatment at the Oncology Outpatient Department of Edogawa Hospital who were recommended home-based care owing to their difficulty attending outpatient visits. Data regarding home-based care recommendations were obtained from the lists of medical social welfare interventions and hospitalized patients. Patients were classified based on whether they opted for home-based care and their caregivers' caregiving capacity. Survival was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier curve and the log-rank test, and the groups were compared using Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: The median interval between the initial consultation with an oncologist and the date of recommendation for home-based care was six and a half months. Home-based care was mostly recommended because of the progression of cachexia (23 cases) and the worsening of symptoms (11 cases). The median survival for the groups with cachexia and worsening symptoms was 25 days and 35 days, respectively. Ten patients refused home-based care. Of them, six refused it because they wished to continue with outpatient visits. Of the home-based care group (24 patients), only one required an emergency room (ER) visit, while four of the non-home-based care group required ER visits. Regarding end-of-life care, 19 from the home-based care group and four from the non-home-based care group received end-of-life care at home. Additionally, one of the two patients who lived alone and two of the six patients whose caregivers were deemed to have insufficient caregiving capacity received end-of-life care at home. Of the remaining 24 patients, 22 received end-of-life care at home. CONCLUSION: The short survival period of the group with cachexia indicates that it would be beneficial for patients, their family members, and home-based care providers to facilitate earlier referral to home-based care. However, while home-based care is beneficial for patients who wish to spend their final days at home and for their family members, short-term and achievable goals, such as attending the next outpatient visit, may alleviate anxiety in cancer patients and enable them to live their daily lives without constant awareness of death. Additionally, while non-home-based care could lead to extended pain due to the lack of readily accessible medical personnel, ER visits, and hospital-based end-of-life care, home-based care can be mentally and physically strenuous for the primary caregiver. Therefore, comprehensive information about palliative care options should be provided early on during the outpatient visits of cancer patients who wish for home-based care for informed decision-making.
