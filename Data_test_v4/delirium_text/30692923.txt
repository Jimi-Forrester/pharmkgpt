30692923|a|The diagnosis of PD might be in difficulty, especially in the early stages. Therefore, the identification of novel biomarkers is imperative for the diagnosis and monitoring disease progression in PD. DJ-1 and alpha-synuclein, are two proteins that are critically involved in the pathogenesis of PD, and they have been examined as disease biomarkers in studies. However, no study exists regarding DJ-1 in plasma neural-derived exosomes. In the present study, the levels of DJ-1 and alpha-synuclein in plasma neural-derived exosomes were studied together in order to investigate novel biomarkers for PD. DJ-1 and alpha-synuclein in plasma and plasma neural-derived exosomes of the patients with PD and controls were quantified by ELISAs. The data revealed that the levels of DJ-1 and alpha-synuclein in plasma neural-derived exosomes and the ratio of plasma neural-derived exosomal DJ-1 to total DJ-1 were significantly higher in patients with PD, compared with controls, while levels of the two proteins in plasma exhibited no difference between the patients with PD and controls. However, no relationship was identified between biomarkers and disease progression. In addition, significant positive correlations between DJ-1 and alpha-synuclein in plasma neural-derived exosomes were found in the patients with PD and in healthy individuals. We hypothesize that DJ-1 in plasma neural-derived exosomes may be used as a potential biomarker as alpha-synuclein in PD and they might participate in the mechanism of PD together.
