38284498|t|The effectiveness of preoperative delirium prevention in intermediate to high-risk older surgical patients: A systematic review.
38284498|a|BACKGROUND: Few reviews have addressed delirium prevention among intermediate to high-risk older surgical patients. AIMS: To map preoperative delirium prevention interventions for older surgical patients at intermediate to high risk of developing delirium, assess outcomes and identify gaps in knowledge. DESIGN: Systematic narrative review of randomised controlled trials reported following the PRISMA checklist. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted of the literature published from 1990 to October 2022 in Medline, CINAHL and Ageline and of the grey literature in Google Scholar. Randomised controlled trials were retrieved that assessed the effectiveness of preoperative delirium prevention interventions for older surgical patients at intermediate to high risk of delirium. Data were extracted using a data extraction tool, and results were tabulated. Studies were assessed for bias using the Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias tool. RESULTS: Twenty-one studies met the selection criteria including N = 5096 participants. Two studies tested cognitive training, two studies tested fascia iliaca compartment block and one study assessed femoral nerve block. Ten studies tested prophylactic medications including methylprednisolone. Five studies investigated geriatric assessment and management. One study assessed transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation. In the two studies testing fascia iliaca compartment block, there was a reduction in postoperative delirium for orthopaedic patients. Methylprednisolone reduced postoperative delirium in orthopaedic patients and in those undergoing gastrointestinal surgery. Results of all other interventions on the occurrence of postoperative delirium and additional outcomes including the severity and duration of delirium were inconclusive. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the promising results for fascia iliaca compartment block and methylprednisolone, there is limited knowledge regarding evidence-based delirium prevention interventions. Most studies had small sample sizes indicating that the current evidence is exploratory. There is an urgent need for the funding and conduct of trials to test preventative interventions for older surgical patients at intermediate to high risk of developing delirium.
