34573100|t|Signaling Overlap between the Golgi Stress Response and Cysteine Metabolism in Huntington's Disease.
34573100|a|Huntington's disease (HD) is caused by expansion of polyglutamine repeats in the protein huntingtin, which affects the corpus striatum of the brain. The polyglutamine repeats in mutant huntingtin cause its aggregation and elicit toxicity by affecting several cellular processes, which include dysregulated organellar stress responses. The Golgi apparatus not only plays key roles in the transport, processing, and targeting of proteins, but also functions as a sensor of stress, signaling through the Golgi stress response. Unlike the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response, the Golgi stress response is relatively unexplored. This review focuses on the molecular mechanisms underlying the Golgi stress response and its intersection with cysteine metabolism in HD.
