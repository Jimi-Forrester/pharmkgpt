36998592|t|MR Template-Based Individual Brain PET Volumes-of-Interest Generation Neither Using MR nor Using Spatial Normalization.
36998592|a|For more anatomically precise quantitation of mouse brain PET, spatial normalization (SN) of PET onto MR template and subsequent template volumes-of-interest (VOIs)-based analysis are commonly used. Although this leads to dependency on the corresponding MR and the process of SN, routine preclinical/clinical PET images cannot always afford corresponding MR and relevant VOIs. To resolve this issue, we propose a deep learning (DL)-based individual-brain-specific VOIs (i.e., cortex, hippocampus, striatum, thalamus, and cerebellum) directly generated from PET images using the inverse-spatial-normalization (iSN)-based VOI labels and deep convolutional neural network model (deep CNN). Our technique was applied to mutated amyloid precursor protein and presenilin-1 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. Eighteen mice underwent T2-weighted MRI and 18F FDG PET scans before and after the administration of human immunoglobin or antibody-based treatments. To train the CNN, PET images were used as inputs and MR iSN-based target VOIs as labels. Our devised methods achieved decent performance in terms of not only VOI agreements (i.e., Dice similarity coefficient) but also the correlation of mean counts and SUVR, and CNN-based VOIs was highly accordant with ground-truth (the corresponding MR and MR template-based VOIs). Moreover, the performance metrics were comparable to that of VOI generated by MR-based deep CNN. In conclusion, we established a novel quantitative analysis method both MR-less and SN-less fashion to generate individual brain space VOIs using MR template-based VOIs for PET image quantification.
