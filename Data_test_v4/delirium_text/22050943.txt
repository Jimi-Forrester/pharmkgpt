22050943|a|Each year in the United States, approximately 1.7 million people are diagnosed with a traumatic brain injury (TBI), about 75% of which are classified as mild TBIs or concussions. Although symptoms typically resolve in a matter of weeks, both children and adults may suffer from postconcussion syndrome for months or longer. A progressive tauopathy, chronic traumatic encephalopathy, is believed to stem from repeated brain trauma. Alzheimer-like dementia, Parkinsonism, and motor neuron disease are also associated with repetitive brain trauma. Effective diagnoses, treatments, and education plans are required to reduce the future burden and incidence of long-term effects of head injuries.
