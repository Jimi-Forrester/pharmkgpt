32005158|a|BACKGROUND: This paper aims to identify whether health care staff perceive a 12-week online facilitated, multimodal, person-centred care, dementia education program influences their knowledge, skills, behaviour and practice improvement activities in dementia care. In particular it will examine a dementia education program 'Positive Approach to Care of the Older Person with Dementia' (The Program). METHODS: Three clusters of online questions were developed. Participants completed the first cluster at course completion (N = 1455;2013-2016). The second cluster was added into the 2015-2016 exit-surveys to measure clinical practice improvement (CPI) activities implementation (N = 520). Thirdly, all participants were invited to a 2018 follow-up survey (N = 343). The Program was also matched with key factors that are likely to result in effective online dementia education programs. RESULTS: The Program had a 78% completion rate. At course completion (2013-2016, N = 1455), 62% felt that the online forums generated useful discussion and 92% thought their work would support implementing their new knowledge and skills. In 2015-16, participants (N = 520) reported that The Program had influenced their practice in terms of new knowledge (87%), understanding (87%), awareness (88%), and new ideas about delivering dementia care (80%). Almost all (95%) participants indicated they had changed 'an aspect of their own professional practice'. Sixty-three percent had planned to develop a CPI activity. Of those (N = 310), 40% developed a new or improved tool and 21% planned to deliver education or create new resources. The most common CPI activities reported in the 2018 follow-up survey (N = 343) included education (49%) and role modelling of new behaviour (47%). Additionally, 75% indicated their CPI influenced their practice and had influenced patients (53%) and colleagues (53%). Fifty-seven percent reported their projects were sustained for 12 months or more. CONCLUSION: The Positive Approach to Care of the Older Person with Dementia education program can potentially improve training the dementia workforce. Participants perceived that a multimodal online platform facilitated by clinical champions influences knowledge transfer, skills and behaviour, encourages workplace CPI activities. Further effort could be directed towards empowering and supporting care staff on system, procedure and practice change and engaging management to translate training activities into practice.
