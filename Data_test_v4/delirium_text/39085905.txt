39085905|a|BACKGROUND: With the introduction of transcatheter aortic valve implantation, the role of surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) in elderly patients has been called into question. We investigated the short-term outcomes of SAVR in the elderly population. METHODS: All patients aged >= 70 years who underwent isolated SAVR in our centre between 2008 and 2017 were included in the study. Survival at 30 days and 1 year were compared for patients aged 70-79 years (n = 809) versus patients aged >= 80 years (n = 322). Factors associated with poorer survival outcomes were identified using multivariable Cox regression analysis. RESULTS: Patients aged 70-79 years and patients aged >= 80 years had similar survival rates at 30 days (98.1% vs. 98.4%, p = 0.732) and 1 year (96.0% vs. 94.1%, p = 0.162) post-SAVR. This remained true after multivariable adjustment. Risk factors for 30 day all-cause mortality included insulin dependent diabetes (HR 6.17, 95% CI 1.32-28.92, p = 0.021) and increasing cardiopulmonary bypass time (HR 2.72, 95% CI 1.89-3.91, p < 0.0001). Significant risk factors for 1 year all-cause mortality were New York Heart Association (NYHA) class IV (HR 6.25, 95% CI 1.55-25.24, p = 0.010) and longer cardiopulmonary bypass time (HR 1.94, 95% CI 1.40-2.69, p < 0.0001). Similar results were obtained for cardiac-specific mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Short-term outcomes of SAVR are excellent in elderly patients and age alone is not a predictor of poorer outcomes. However, the increased risk of mortality in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes and those with severe functional impairment (NYHA class IV) should be carefully considered when selecting patients for SAVR in this elderly population.
