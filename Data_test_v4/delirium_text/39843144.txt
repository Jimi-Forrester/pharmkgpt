39843144|a|The neuronal cytoskeleton has remained a less explored area of research in establishing neuroprotection. HDAC6 has been studied with respect to many neurodegenerative diseases, especially AD. It exhibits the ability to interact with various cytoskeletal proteins and to promote migration in cells. Podosomes are actin microstructures that help cells to migrate in the extracellular environment. The aim of this review is to bring into focus the significance of studies on the involvement of podosomes in Alzheimer's disease. We have suggested that Histone Deacetylase 6 plays a vital role in AD, through its interactions with the various signalling processes in the cell, most importantly the cytoskeletal remodelling machinery within the podosomes.
