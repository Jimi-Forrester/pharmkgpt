37047843|t|Imbalance of Essential Metals in Traumatic Brain Injury and Its Possible Link with Disorders of Consciousness.
37047843|a|Dysfunction of the complex cerebral networks underlying wakefulness and awareness is responsible for Disorders of Consciousness (DoC). Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is a common cause of DoC, and it is responsible for a multi-dimensional pathological cascade that affects the proper functioning of the brainstem and brain consciousness pathways. Iron (Fe), Zinc (Zn), and Copper (Cu) have a role in the neurophysiology of both the ascending reticular activating system, a multi-neurotransmitter network located in the brainstem that is crucial for consciousness, and several brain regions. We aimed to summarize the role of these essential metals in TBI and its possible link with consciousness alterations. We found that TBI alters many neuronal molecular mechanisms involving essential metals, causing neurodegeneration, neural apoptosis, synaptic dysfunction, oxidative stress, and inflammation. This final pattern resembles that described for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other neurological and psychiatric diseases. Furthermore, we found that amantadine, zolpidem, and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)-the most used treatments for DoC recovery-seem to have an effect on essential metals-related pathways and that Zn might be a promising new therapeutic approach. This review summarizes the neurophysiology of essential metals in the brain structures of consciousness and focuses on the mechanisms underlying their imbalance following TBI, suggesting their possible role in DoC. The scenario supports further studies aimed at getting a deeper insight into metals' role in DoC, in order to evaluate metal-based drugs, such as metal complexes and metal chelating agents, as potential therapeutic options.
