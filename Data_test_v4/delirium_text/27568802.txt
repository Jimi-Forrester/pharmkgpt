27568802|a|STUDY OBJECTIVES: Emerging evidence suggests a role for sleep in contributing to the progression of Alzheimer disease (AD). Slow wave sleep (SWS) is the stage during which synaptic activity is minimal and clearance of neuronal metabolites is high, making it an ideal state to regulate levels of amyloid beta (Abeta). We thus aimed to examine relationships between concentrations of Abeta42 in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and measures of SWS in cognitively normal elderly subjects. METHODS: Thirty-six subjects underwent a clinical and cognitive assessment, a structural MRI, a morning to early afternoon lumbar puncture, and nocturnal polysomnography. Correlations and linear regression analyses were used to assess for associations between CSF Abeta42 levels and measures of SWS controlling for potential confounders. Resulting models were compared to each other using ordinary least squared linear regression analysis. Additionally, the participant sample was dichotomized into "high" and "low" Abeta42 groups to compare SWS bout length using survival analyses. RESULTS: A significant inverse correlation was found between CSF Abeta42 levels, SWS duration and other SWS characteristics. Collectively, total SWA in the frontal lead was the best predictor of reduced CSF Abeta42 levels when controlling for age and ApoE status. Total sleep time, time spent in NREM1, NREM2, or REM sleep were not correlated with CSF Abeta42. CONCLUSIONS: In cognitively normal elderly, reduced and fragmented SWS is associated with increases in CSF Abeta42, suggesting that disturbed sleep might drive an increase in soluble brain Abeta levels prior to amyloid deposition.
