36561151|t|Prevalence of Cervical Canal Stenosis in Patients with Femoral Fracture: A Retrospective Single-Center Study.
36561151|a|Introduction: Cervical spine surgery reduces falls and subsequent femoral fractures. Nonetheless, current evidence on the prevalence of cervical cord compression (CCC) and increased signal intensity (ISI) in patients with femoral fractures is limited. We aimed to determine the prevalence of CCC and ISI and characterize the physical status and imaging findings using cervical spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and brain computed tomography (CT) in patients with femoral fractures. Methods: This study included 173 patients (140 women, 33 men) with femoral fractures caused by falling, who underwent both cervical spine MRI and brain CT. CCC cases classified as grade 2 (compression of less than one-third of the spinal cord) or higher were investigated. The ISI of the severely affected intervertebral disc level was evaluated using T2-weighted MRI. Hand grip strength and myelopathic signs were also evaluated. Data analysis was performed using the chi2 test, Fisher's exact test, and Student's t-test. Results: Among the 173 patients, 83 (48.0%) had CCC, 29 (16.8%) had ISI, and 68 (39.3%) had abnormal brain CT findings. There was no ISI in patients in the non-CCC group. The patients' average age in the CCC group was significantly higher than that in the non-CCC group. There was no significant difference in the proportion of myelopathic sign and abnormal brain CT findings between the CCC and non-CCC groups or between the ISI and non-ISI groups. Bilateral hand grip strength was significantly negatively correlated with the stenosis rate (right, p=0.047; left, p=0.0018). Conclusions: In conclusion, our study showed that patients with femoral fractures had a high frequency of cervical canal stenosis and intracranial lesions using cervical spine MRI and brain CT.
