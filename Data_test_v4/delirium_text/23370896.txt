23370896|a|Therapeutic strategies in Alzheimer's disease (AD) must take into account the characteristics of elderly people, who often have somatic comorbidities. Moreover, demented patients are more frequently frailer than older people. They have a higher number of admissions to hospital, a greater prevalence of complications and an increased risk of death. Therapeutic decisions for these patients have to be approached cautiously: aging, a more elevated comorbidity/polytherapy index and frailty contribute to enhance the risk of pharmacological adverse events and drug interactions. The aim of the present study was to focus on risk-benefit profile of pharmacological therapy for AD in relation to somatic comorbidities that often affect these patients. A Medline search (from 2001 to 2012) was performed using as key words dementia, Alzheimer's disease, drug treatment, somatic comorbidities, side effects/adverse events and elderly. Cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) and memantine represent the main pharmacological strategies effective in reducing the progression of cognitive decline and functional loss in AD. Many conditions very common in the elderly may restrict the use of ChEIs and/or treatment efficacy in AD patients. Memantine has a good efficacy and tolerability profile with better safety in pulmonary, cardiovascular and central nervous system comorbidities compared to ChEIs. Drug interactions with memantine are also more favorable since they concern mostly drugs not commonly used in the elderly. Only a careful evaluation of the associated somatic diseases, taking into account different drugs safety indexes and tolerability, can lead to personalized treatment management, in order to maximize drug efficacy and optimize quality of life.
