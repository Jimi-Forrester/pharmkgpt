Toxicity associated biological characterization of these chemicals is challenging and inefficient, even with available high-throughput technologies. In this report, we describe a novel computational method for characterizing toxicity, associated biological perturbations and disease outcome, called the Chemo-Phenotypic Based Toxicity Measurement (CPTM). CPTM is used to quantify the EC "toxicity score" (Zts), which serves as a holistic metric of potential toxicity and disease outcome. CPTM quantitative toxicity is the measure of chemical features, biological phenotypic effects, and toxicokinetic properties of the ECs. For proof-of-concept, we subject ECs obtained from the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) database to the CPTM. We validated the CPTM toxicity predictions by correlating 'Zts' scores with known toxicity effects. We also confirmed the CPTM predictions with in-vitro, and in-vivo experiments. In in-vitro and zebrafish models, we showed that, mixtures of the motor oil and food additive 'Salpn' with endogenous nuclear receptor ligands such as Vitamin D3, dysregulated the nuclear receptors and key transcription pathways involved in Colorectal Cancer. Further, in a human patient derived cell organoid model, we found that a mixture of the widely used pesticides 'Tetramethrin' and 'Fenpropathrin' significantly impacts the population of patient derived pancreatic cancer cells and 3D organoid models to support rapid PDAC disease progression. The CPTM method is, to our knowledge, the first comprehensive toxico-physicochemical, and phenotypic bionetwork-based platform for efficient high-throughput screening of environmental chemical toxicity, mechanisms of action, and connection to disease outcomes.
