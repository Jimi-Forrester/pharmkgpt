34073365|t|Expression and Prognostic Characteristics of Ferroptosis-Related Genes in Colon Cancer.
34073365|a|Ferroptosis is a new type of programmed cell death, which occurs with iron dependence. Previous studies have showed that ferroptosis plays an important regulatory role in the occurrence and development of tumors. Colon cancer is one of the major morbidities and causes of mortality in the world. This study used RNA-seq and colon cancer clinical data to explore the relationship between ferroptosis-related genes and colon cancer. Based on the fifteen prognostic ferroptosis-related genes, two molecular subgroups of colon cancer were identified. Surprisingly, we also found cluster2 was characterized by lower mutation burden and expression of checkpoint genes, better survival, and higher expression of NOX1. Moreover, cluster2 has fewer BRAF mutations. We also found the expression of NOX1 is related to the status of BRAF. Finally, using 15 ferroptosis-related genes from The Cancer Genome Atlas cohort, we constructed a prognosis model, and this model may be used to predict the prognosis of patients in clinics.
