15118358|a|The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of quetiapine in the treatment of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) in patients with senile dementia of Alzheimer type (SDAT). Sixteen SDAT patients with BPSD were recruited and quetiapine (25- 200 mg/day) was prescribed for 8 weeks. BPSD were evaluated with the Behavioral Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale (BEHAVE-AD) and Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI) at week 0 (baseline) and week 8 (endpoint). The severity of the extrapyramidal symptoms was also assessed by the Drug-Induced Extrapyramidal Symptoms Scale (DIEPSS) at baseline and endpoint. Significant improvements were seen in the CMAI total score and in the BEHAVE-AD subscales of delusions, activity disturbances, aggressiveness, diurnal rhythm disturbances and in the BEHAVE-AD overall severity. There was no significant difference between the baseline and endpoint in the DIEPSS score. These data indicate that quetiapine is effective in controlling BPSD with favorable adverse-event profiles.
