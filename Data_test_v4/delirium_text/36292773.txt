36292773|t|Epigenetic and Proteomic Biomarkers of Elevated Alcohol Use Predict Epigenetic Aging and Cell-Type variation Better Than Self-Report.
36292773|a|Excessive alcohol consumption (EAC) has a generally accepted effect on morbidity and mortality, outcomes thought to be reflected in measures of epigenetic aging (EA). As the association of self-reported EAC with EA has not been consistent with these expectations, underscoring the need for readily employable non-self-report tools for accurately assessing and monitoring the contribution of EAC to accelerated EA, newly developed alcohol consumption DNA methylation indices, such as the Alcohol T Score (ATS) and Methyl DetectR (MDR), may be helpful. To test that hypothesis, we used these new indices along with the carbohydrate deficient transferrin (CDT), concurrent as well as past self-reports of EAC, and well-established measures of cigarette smoking to examine the relationship of EAC to both accelerated EA and immune cell counts in a cohort of 437 young Black American adults. We found that MDR, CDT, and ATS were intercorrelated, even after controlling for gender and cotinine effects. Correlations between EA and self-reported EAC were low or non-significant, replicating prior research, whereas correlations with non-self-report indices were significant and more substantial. Comparing non-self-report indices showed that the ATS predicted more than four times as much variance in EA, CDT4 cells and B-cells as for both the MDR and CDT, and better predicted indices of accelerated EA. We conclude that each of the non-self-report indices have differing predictive capacities with respect to key alcohol-related health outcomes, and that the ATS may be particularly useful for clinicians seeking to understand and prevent accelerated EA. The results also underscore the likelihood of substantial underestimates of problematic use when self-report is used and a reduction in correlations with EA and variance in cell-types.
