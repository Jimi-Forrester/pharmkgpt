29321405|t|Reversible Parkinsonism and Multiple Cerebral Infarctions after Pulmonary Endarterectomy in a Patient with Antiphospholipid Syndrome.
29321405|a|Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is a cause of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) and it is associated with an increased risk of postoperative neurological complications. We experienced a case of reversible parkinsonism after pulmonary endarterectomy (PEA) and subsequent multiple cerebral infarctions under standard anticoagulation therapy in a patient with CTEPH associated with APS. Strict management using a combination of antiplatelet and anticoagulation therapy should be considered in patients with a high titer of triple antiphospholipid antibodies in the perioperative period. We should be aware of the high risk of postoperative neurologic manifestations in patients with APS.
