35987277|t|Kinetic and structural studies on the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase by a series of multitarget-directed galantamine-peptide derivatives.
35987277|a|Complex neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, are one of the major therapeutic areas to which multitarget drug discovery strategies have been applied in the last twenty years. Due to the complex multifactorial etiopathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, it has been proposed that to be successful the pharmaceutical agents should act on multiple targets in order to restore the complex disease network and to provide disease modifying effects. Here we report on the synthesis and the anticholinergic activity profiles of seven multitarget anti-Alzheimer compounds designed by combining galantamine, a well-known acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, with different peptide fragments endowed with inhibitory activity against BACE-1. A complementary approach based on molecular docking simulations of the galantamine-peptide derivatives in the active sites of acetylcholinesterase and of the related butyrylcholinesterase, as well as on inhibition kinetics, by global fitting of the reaction progress curves, allowed to gain insights into the enzyme-inhibitor mechanism of interaction. The resulting structure-activity relationships pave the way towards the design of more effective pharmacodynamic/pharmacokinetic multitarget inhibitors.
