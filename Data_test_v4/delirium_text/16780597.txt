16780597|t|Sedation in the intensive care unit with remifentanil/propofol versus midazolam/fentanyl: a randomised, open-label, pharmacoeconomic trial.
16780597|a|INTRODUCTION: Remifentanil is an opioid with a unique pharmacokinetic profile. Its organ-independent elimination and short context-sensitive half time of 3 to 4 minutes lead to a highly predictable offset of action. We tested the hypothesis that with an analgesia-based sedation regimen with remifentanil and propofol, patients after cardiac surgery reach predefined criteria for discharge from the intensive care unit (ICU) sooner, resulting in shorter duration of time spent in the ICU, compared to a conventional regimen consisting of midazolam and fentanyl. In addition, the two regimens were compared regarding their costs. METHODS: In this prospective, open-label, randomised, single-centre study, a total of 80 patients (18 to 75 years old), who had undergone cardiac surgery, were postoperatively assigned to one of two treatment regimens for sedation in the ICU for 12 to 72 hours. Patients in the remifentanil/propofol group received remifentanil (6- max. 60 microg kg(-1) h(-1); dose exceeds recommended labelling). Propofol (0.5 to 4.0 mg kg(-1) h(-1)) was supplemented only in the case of insufficient sedation at maximal remifentanil dose. Patients in the midazolam/fentanyl group received midazolam (0.02 to 0.2 mg kg(-1) h(-1)) and fentanyl (1.0 to 7.0 microg kg(-1) h(-1)). For treatment of pain after extubation, both groups received morphine and/or non-opioid analgesics. RESULTS: The time intervals (mean values +/- standard deviation) from arrival at the ICU until extubation (20.7 +/- 5.2 hours versus 24.2 h +/- 7.0 hours) and from arrival until eligible discharge from the ICU (46.1 +/- 22.0 hours versus 62.4 +/- 27.2 hours) were significantly (p < 0.05) shorter in the remifentanil/propofol group. Overall costs of the ICU stay per patient were equal (approximately euro1,700 on average). CONCLUSION: Compared with midazolam/fentanyl, a remifentanil-based regimen for analgesia and sedation supplemented with propofol significantly reduced the time on mechanical ventilation and allowed earlier discharge from the ICU, at equal overall costs.
