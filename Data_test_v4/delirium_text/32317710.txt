32317710|t|Relationship between lumbar lordosis and the ratio of the spinous process height to the anterior spinal column height.
32317710|a|Purpose Global sagittal imbalance with lumbar hypo-lordosis leads to various problems in elderly populations and is often treated with long-segment fusion and osteotomy. These highly invasive procedures result in a wide range of rigid spines with a high rate of complications. Although some reports have mentioned the primary aetiology of hypo-lordosis, there is limited evidence. Thus, understanding the exact underlying mechanism is required for developing minimally invasive procedures. This study aimed to investigate the factors related to lumbar lordosis (LL) in elderly people. Methods A total of ninety consecutive patients aged >= sixty years at a single spine centre were included. We measured LL, the anterior spinal column height consisting of vertebral bodies and intervertebral discs from L1 to L5 (ASC-5) and the sum of the spinous process heights from L1 to L5 (SP-5) with computed tomography in a supine position. The relationship between LL and the SP-5/ASC-5 ratio, SP-5, and ASC-5 was analysed. Results The Pearson correlation coefficients between LL and the SP-5/ASC-5 ratio, SP-5, and ASC-5 were -0.80 (p < 0.001), -0.43 (p < 0.001) and 0.36 (p < 0.001), respectively. Conclusion LL was significantly related to the SP-5/ASC-5 ratio of the lumbar spine in elderly people. In addition to shortening of the ASC, elongation of the SP-5 also contributed to a loss of LL.
