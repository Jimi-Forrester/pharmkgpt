38473307|t|Self-Completion Questionnaire on Sleep Evaluation in Patients Undergoing Oxaliplatin Therapy: An Observational Study.
38473307|a|Sleep is a fundamental human need; sleep disruption, in fact, causes an increase in the activity of the sympathetic nervous system and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, metabolic effects, changes in circadian rhythms, and pro-inflammatory responses. The scientific literature is finally starting to pay attention to the central role of sleep alterations in patients health. Oxaliplatin is extensively used for the treatment of gastrointestinal cancer and other malignancies, with an increased frequency of use in recent years. This study aims to understand the effects of sleep complaints on health and quality of life in cancer patients treated with oxaliplatin. A study has been conducted through the creation and distribution of questionnaires to patients to investigate their complaints about sleep quality. We observed significant differences between males and females in evaluating sleep hygiene scores, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and previous difficulty sleeping. Moreover, in females, stress, worries, and anxiety seem to play a negative role in the sleep hygiene score. The obtained results could improve the interest of healthcare personnel and caregivers in sleep quality in patients undergoing chemotherapy.
