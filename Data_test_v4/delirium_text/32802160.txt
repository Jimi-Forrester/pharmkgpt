32802160|a|Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells have an unprecedented positive curative effect for hematological malignances. Most notably, cluster of differentiation 19 (CD19) CAR T-cell therapy for pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia is associated with a high complete remission rate and has aroused considerable attention in the medical field. However, it also causes a series of adverse reactions and increases the risk of recurrence. The present review examines the results of CD19 CAR T-cell therapy and lists its adverse effects. In addition, some of the mechanisms of recurrence are characterized and applicable strategies to address this challenging problem are proposed.
