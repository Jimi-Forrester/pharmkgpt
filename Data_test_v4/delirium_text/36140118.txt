36140118|t|Nanomaterial-Based Electrochemical Nanodiagnostics for Human and Gut Metabolites Diagnostics: Recent Advances and Challenges.
36140118|a|Metabolites are the intermediatory products of metabolic processes catalyzed by numerous enzymes found inside the cells. Detecting clinically relevant metabolites is important to understand their physiological and biological functions along with the evolving medical diagnostics. Rapid advances in detecting the tiny metabolites such as biomarkers that signify disease hallmarks have an immense need for high-performance identifying techniques. Low concentrations are found in biological fluids because the metabolites are difficult to dissolve in an aqueous medium. Therefore, the selective and sensitive study of metabolites as biomarkers in biological fluids is problematic. The different non-electrochemical and conventional methods need a long time of analysis, long sampling, high maintenance costs, and costly instrumentation. Hence, employing electrochemical techniques in clinical examination could efficiently meet the requirements of fully automated, inexpensive, specific, and quick means of biomarker detection. The electrochemical methods are broadly utilized in several emerging and established technologies, and electrochemical biosensors are employed to detect different metabolites. This review describes the advancement in electrochemical sensors developed for clinically associated human metabolites, including glucose, lactose, uric acid, urea, cholesterol, etc., and gut metabolites such as TMAO, TMA, and indole derivatives. Different sensing techniques are evaluated for their potential to achieve relevant degrees of multiplexing, specificity, and sensitivity limits. Moreover, we have also focused on the opportunities and remaining challenges for integrating the electrochemical sensor into the point-of-care (POC) devices.
