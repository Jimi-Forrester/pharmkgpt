39382682|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, but the disease lacks convenient and cost-effective alternative biomarkers currently. We utilized targeted lipid metabolomics based on nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to identify plasma biomarkers in AD patients. Our study was a cross-sectional study that enrolled 58 AD patients and 40 matched health controls (HCs). Firstly, we identified plasma lipid metabolites that were significantly different between the two groups based on P < 0.05 and variable importance in the projection (VIP) > 1. Then we examined the correlation between the lipid metabolites and cognitive function using partial correlation analysis and assessed the diagnostic ability of the lipid metabolites using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Seventeen lipoproteins showed significant differences between AD patients and HCs among 114 lipid metabolites. All 17 lipoproteins were subtypes of low-density lipoprotein (LDL). Among them, LDL-3 particle number, LDL-3 apolipoprotein-B, LDL-3 phospholipids, LDL free cholesterol and LDL phospholipids were significantly correlated with cognitive function. The ROC curves showed that LDL-2 triglycerides (TG) and LDL-3 TG could significantly distinguish AD patients from HCs, with the area under the curve (AUC) above 0.7. In addition, we explored a strategy of combined diagnosis that significantly improved the diagnostic efficacy for AD (AUC = 0.879). Our study provides insight into the lipoprotein alterations associated with AD and potential biomarkers for its diagnosis and cognitive function assessment.
