33681713|a|BACKGROUND: The present systematic review and meta-analysis of diagnostic test accuracy summarizes the last three decades in advances on diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in developed and developing countries. OBJECTIVE: To determine the accuracy of biomarkers in diagnostic tools in AD, for example, cerebrospinal fluid, positron emission tomography (PET), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), etc. METHODS: The authors searched PubMed for published studies from 1990 to April 2020 on AD diagnostic biomarkers. 84 published studies were pooled and analyzed in this meta-analysis and diagnostic accuracy was compared by summary receiver operating characteristic statistics. RESULTS: Overall, 84 studies met the criteria and were included in a meta-analysis. For EEG, the sensitivity ranged from 67 to 98%, with a median of 80%, 95% CI [75, 91], tau-PET diagnosis sensitivity ranged from 76 to 97%, with a median of 94%, 95% CI [76, 97]; and MRI sensitivity ranged from 41 to 99%, with a median of 84%, 95% CI [81, 87]. Our results showed that tau-PET diagnosis had higher performance as compared to other diagnostic methods in this meta-analysis. CONCLUSION: Our findings showed an important discrepancy in diagnostic data for AD between developed and developing countries, which can impact global prevalence estimation and management of AD. Also, our analysis found a better performance for the tau-PET diagnostic over other methods to diagnose AD patients, but the expense of tau-PET scan seems to be the limiting factor in the diagnosis of AD in developing countries such as those found in Asia, Africa, and Latin America.
