36532180|t|Alzheimer's disease and depression in the elderly: A trajectory linking gut microbiota and serotonin signaling.
36532180|a|The occurrence of neuropsychiatric symptoms in the elderly is viewed as an early sign of subsequent cognitive deterioration and conversion from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease. The prognosis in terms of both the severity and progression of clinical dementia is generally aggravated by the comorbidity of neuropsychiatric symptoms and decline in cognitive function. Undeniably, aging and in particular unhealthy aging, is a silent "engine of neuropathology" over which multiple changes take place, including drastic alterations of the gut microbial ecosystem. This narrative review evaluates the role of gut microbiota changes as a possible unifying concept through which the comorbidity of neuropsychiatric symptoms and Alzheimer's disease can be considered. However, since the heterogeneity of neuropsychiatric symptoms, it is improbable to describe the same type of alterations in the bacteria population observed in patients with Alzheimer's disease, as well as it is improbable that the variety of drugs used to treat neuropsychiatric symptoms might produce changes in gut bacterial diversity similar to that observed in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease. Depression seems to be another very intriguing exception, as it is one of the most frequent neuropsychiatric symptoms in dementia and a mood disorder frequently associated with brain aging. Antidepressants (i.e., serotonin reuptake inhibitors) or tryptophan dietary supplementation have been shown to reduce Amyloid beta-loading, reinstate microbial diversity and reduce the abundance of bacterial taxa dominant in depression and Alzheimer's disease. This review briefly examines this trajectory by discussing the dysfunction of gut microbiota composition, selected bacterial taxa, and alteration of tryptophan and serotonin metabolism/neurotransmission as overlapping in-common mechanisms involved with depression, Alzheimer's disease, and unhealthy aging.
