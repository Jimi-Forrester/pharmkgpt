38361318|a|INTRODUCTION: Cigarette smoking increases both the risk for insulin resistance and amyloid-beta (Abeta) aggregation, and impaired brain insulin/insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) signaling might increase risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD). We aimed to investigate the association among cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) insulin sensitivity/IGF1, glucose/lactate, and Abeta42 and further explore whether insulin sensitivity contributed to the risk for AD in active smokers. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, levels of insulin, IGF1, and lactate/glucose of 75 active smokers and 78 nonsmokers in CSF were measured. Three polymorphisms regulating IGF1 were genotyped. Analysis of variance was used to compare differences of variables between groups. Partial correlation was performed to test the relationship between CSF biomarkers and smoking status. General linear models were applied to test the interaction of the effect of single nucleotide polymorphisms and cigarette smoking on CSF IGF1 levels. RESULTS: In the CSF from active smokers, IGF1 and lactate levels were significantly lower (p = .016 and p = .010, respectively), whereas Abeta42 (derived from our earlier research) and insulin levels were significantly higher (p < .001 and p = .022, respectively) as compared to the CSF from nonsmokers. The AG + GG genotype of rs6218 in active smokers had a significant effect on lower CSF IGF1 levels (p = .004) and lower CSF insulin levels in nonsmokers (p = .016). CONCLUSIONS: Cigarette smoking as the "at-risk" factor for AD might be due to lower cerebral insulin sensitivity in CSF, and the subjects with rs6218G allele seem to be more susceptible to the neurodegenerative risks for cigarette smoking.
