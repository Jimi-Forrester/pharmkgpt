38022349|t|Our Hidden Enemy: Ultra-Processed Foods, Inflammation, and the Battle for Heart Health.
38022349|a|Over the past few decades, we have witnessed unprecedented growth in new data that has fundamentally changed our traditional understanding of the progression of atherosclerotic plaques, as well as our strategies for preventing cardiovascular diseases, especially atherosclerosis. It was once believed that atherosclerosis was primarily caused by abnormal lipid buildup in the vessel intima, leading to plaque growth and luminal stenosis, with or without rupture. This perspective has now evolved to encompass more complex pathways, wherein the accumulation of abnormal products of oxidation and inflammation are the most likely factors mediating the growth of atherosclerotic plaques. The review aims to provide a comprehensive and detailed exploration of the relationship between ultra-processed foods, chronic inflammation, cardiovascular diseases, obesity, insulin resistance, and the role of the gut microbiota. It touches on several important aspects of modern diet and health.
