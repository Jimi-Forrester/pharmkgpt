30938150|t|Ultrasensitive Fluorescence Detection of Alzheimer's Disease Based on Polyvalent Directed Peptide Polymer Coupled to a Nanoporous ZnO Nanoplatform.
30938150|a|Amyloid-beta 42 (Abeta42), the key biomarker of Alzheimer's disease (AD), aggregates to form neurotoxic amyloid plaques. In this work, we modified two fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled Abeta42-targeting peptides and designed an Abeta42-specific ultrasensitive polyvalent-directed peptide polymer (PDPP) to enhance AD diagnosis sensitivity. The dissociation constant of Abeta42 by PDPP was 103-fold higher than the single-site-directed peptide. The improved binding was due to the ability of PDPP to detect multiple receptors on the target. The power of the PDPP diagnostic probe was verified in its application to detect Abeta42 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which showed a lower limit of detection (LOD) in the fg mL-1 range that is more sensitive than detection by antibodies or single peptides. In addition, we present a novel ultrasensitive diagnostic system using an array of nanoporous ZnO nanoparticles, which play a role in fluorescence signal amplification, to further improve AD diagnosis sensitivity. We enhanced the signal on the basis of the properties of nanoporous ZnO nanoparticles and measured and quantified an ultralow concentration (ag mL-1 range) of Abeta42. This PDPP coupled to the nanoporous ZnO-based system is a novel approach to AD diagnosis that might also be useful for the detection of other target biomarkers and clinical applications.
