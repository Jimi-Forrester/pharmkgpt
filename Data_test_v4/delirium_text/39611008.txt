39611008|a|Alzheimer's disease, a progressive neurodegenerative disorder marked by cognitive decline, affects millions worldwide. The presence of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain is the key pathological feature, leading to neuronal dysfunction and cell death. Current treatment options include pharmacological approaches such as cholinesterase inhibitors, as well as non-pharmacological strategies like cognitive training and lifestyle modifications. Recently, the potential role of probiotics, particularly strains, such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, in managing neurodegenerative diseases through the gut-brain axis has garnered significant attention. Probiotics can modulate inflammation, produce neurotransmitters, and support neuronal health, potentially slowing disease progression and alleviating symptoms, such as stress and anxiety. Optimizing the pharmacotherapeutic effects of probiotics is critical and involves advanced formulation techniques, such as microencapsulation and nanoencapsulation. Microencapsulation employs natural or synthetic polymers to protect probiotic cells, enhancing their viability and stability against environmental stressors. Methods like extrusion, emulsion, and spray-drying are used to create microcapsules suited for various applications. Nanoencapsulation, on the other hand, operates at the nanoscale, utilizing polymeric or lipid-based nanoparticles to improve the bioavailability and shelf life of probiotics. Techniques, such as nanoprecipitation and emulsification, are employed to ensure stable nanocapsule formation, thereby augmenting the therapeutic potential of probiotics as nutraceutical agents. This study delves into the essential formulation aspects of microencapsulation and nanoencapsulation for beneficial probiotic strains, aimed at managing Alzheimer's disease by optimizing the gut-brain axis. The insights gained from these advanced techniques promise to enhance probiotic delivery efficacy, potentially leading to improved health outcomes for patients suffering from neurodegenerative disorders.
