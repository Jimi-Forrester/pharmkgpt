37877062|a|We present a rare case of hydatidiform molar pregnancy, which led to the development of thyroid storm, followed by a rare complication of takotsubo cardiomyopathy in the setting of a COVID-19 infection. A 21-year-old female of 22 weeks gestational age presented with heavy vaginal blood loss, brown emesis, tachycardia, and lethargy. Through clinical presentation and ultrasound confirmation, a molar pregnancy was diagnosed. Laboratory data and clinical presentation of thyrotoxicosis supported a diagnosis of thyroid storm. Test for COVID-19 was positive. The patient was treated with dilation and curettage, antithyroid medication, and blood transfusions, resulting in symptom resolution. Thereafter, echocardiography confirmed takotsubo cardiomyopathy. It is suspected that the homology in structure between the human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and thyroid stimulating hormone subunits resulted in thyroid storm secondary to receptor cross-reactivity. We speculate that subsequent cardiovascular stress of b-hCG-induced thyroid storm with superimposed COVID-19 infection facilitated the development of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.
