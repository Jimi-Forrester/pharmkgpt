31329447|t|Proteomic Profile of a Chronic Binge Ethanol Exposure Model.
31329447|a|Chronic binge alcohol drinking is known to increase risky decision through pathological impulsive behaviors. Recently, we established a novel rodent model of ethanol-induced waiting impulsivity using 5-choice serial reaction time task (5-CSRTT) in mice. However, molecular mechanisms underlying the chronic binge ethanol-induced waiting impulsivity is not well characterized. Among brain regions involved in impulsivity, the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is a major neural substrate for mediating the 5-CSRTT-based waiting impulsivity. Thus, we sought to determine the ACC proteomic profile using label-free proteomics of mice exhibiting ethanol-induced impulsivity. Ingenuity pathway analysis revealed that impulsivity-related proteins involved in ion channel complexes such as KCNIP3 (potassium voltage-gated channel interacting protein 3) and CACNG2 (calcium voltage-gated channel auxiliary subunit gamma 2) are downregulated in the ACC. We identified significant protein expression changes in the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) canonical pathway between control and ethanol-induced impulsive mice. Impulsive mice showed over 60% of proteins involved in the mTOR canonical pathway have been altered. This pathway has been previously implicated in the neuroadaptation in drugs of abuse and impulsivity. We found substantial changes in the protein levels involved in neurological disorders such as schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease. Our findings provide a neuroproteomic profile of ethanol-induced impulsive mice.
