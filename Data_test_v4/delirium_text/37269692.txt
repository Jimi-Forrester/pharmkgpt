37269692|t|Foodomics revealed the effects of ultrasonic extraction on the composition and nutrition of cactus fruit (Opuntia ficus-indica) seed oil.
37269692|a|Cactus is a tropical fruit with a high nutritional value; however, little information is available regarding the comprehensive utilization of its byproducts. This study aimed to explore the composition and nutritional value of cactus fruit seed oil (CFO) and reveal the effects of ultrasound-assisted extraction and traditional solvent extraction on oil quality. Foodomics analysis showed that CFO extracted using a traditional solvent is rich in linolenic acid (9c12cC18:2, 57.46 +- 0.84 %), alpha-tocopherol (20.01 +- 1.86 mg/100 g oil), and canolol (200.10 +- 1.21 mug/g). Compared to traditional solvent extraction, ultrasound-assisted extraction can significantly increase the content of lipid concomitants in CFO, whereas excessive ultrasound intensity may lead to the oxidation of oils and the formation of free radicals. Analysis of the thermal properties showed that ultrasound had no effect on the crystallization or melting behavior of CFO. To further demonstrate the nutritional value of CFO, a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced lipid metabolism imbalance model was used. Lipidomics analysis showed that CFO significantly reduced the content of oxidized phospholipids stimulated by LPS and increased the content of highly bioactive metabolites such as ceramides, thus alleviating LPS-induced damage in C. elegans. Hence, CFO is a functional oil with high value, and ultrasound-assisted extraction is advocated. These findings provide new insights into the comprehensive utilization of cactus fruits.
