38951391|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a condition initiated by the assimilation of beta-amyloid plaques (Abeta) and tau tangles, leading to neurodegeneration. It involves frequently cognitive decline as well as memory impairment in patients. Efforts in therapeutic interventions are currently facing challenges in identifying targets within this scaffold that can significantly alter the clinical course for individuals with AD. Moreover, in AD, neurons release a protein called endostatin, which accumulates in Abeta plaques and enhances AD. This accumulation of Abeta in the triggers a cascade of events leading to synaptic dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and ultimately neuronal death. Environmental factors nowadays increase the risk of AD with prolonged exposure of heavy metals such as copper (Cu), lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), cadmium (Cd), and other pesticides. It has been observed that these factors can cause the aggregation of Abeta and tau which initiates the plaque formation and hence leads to enhanced pathogenesis of AD. This review summarizes the interlinking between heavy metals, environmental factors, pesticides, endostatin, and progression of AD has been deliberated with recent findings.
