30883357|t|Rationale and Design of a Clinical Trial of Adapted Tango to Improve Negative Health Impacts in Middle Aged African-American Female Caregivers of Persons with Alzheimer's Disease (ACT Trial).
30883357|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating progressive neurodegenerative disease resulting in memory loss and a severe reduction in ability to perform activities of daily living. The role of caring for someone with AD frequently falls to female family members, often daughters. The burden of caregiving can increase stress and anxiety and cause health decline in the caregiver. The combination of ethnicity-related genetic factors promoting the development of dementias among African-Americans (AA) and the increased risk among women for developing AD means that AA women who are caregivers of a parent with AD are at great risk for developing dementias including AD. The proposed study would compare the cognitive, motor, and psychosocial benefits of a well-established 12 week, 20-lesson adapted Argentine Tango intervention (N = 30) to a no-contact control group (N = 10) in middle-aged (45-65 years) AA women who are caregivers of a parent with AD in the metro Atlanta area.
