32822060|t|Neuroradiologic manifestations of COVID-19: what the emergency radiologist needs to know.
32822060|a|Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a global pandemic with a wide spectrum of clinical signs and symptoms. Neurologic manifestations are relatively common, with severe cases often demonstrating striking findings on neuroimaging. Because the neuroradiologic findings may be the first evidence of COVID-19, the emergency radiologist has a critical role to play in not only the detection and management of the disease but also in the safety of other patients and hospital staff. Therefore, radiologists, especially those who specialize in emergency radiology, need to be aware of the neuroradiologic manifestations of COVID-19.
