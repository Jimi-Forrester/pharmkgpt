36077221|t|A Double-Edged Sword: The Two Faces of PARylation.
36077221|a|Poly ADP-ribosylation (PARylation) is a post-translational modification process. Following the discovery of PARP-1, numerous studies have demonstrated the role of PARylation in the DNA damage and repair responses for cellular stress and DNA damage. Originally, studies on PARylation were confined to PARP-1 activation in the DNA repair pathway. However, the interplay between PARylation and DNA repair suggests that PARylation is important for the efficiency and accuracy of DNA repair. PARylation has contradicting roles; however, recent evidence implicates its importance in inflammation, metabolism, and cell death. These differences might be dependent on specific cellular conditions or experimental models used, and suggest that PARylation may play two opposing roles in cellular homeostasis. Understanding the role of PARylation in cellular function is not only important for identifying novel therapeutic approaches; it is also essential for gaining insight into the mechanisms of unexplored diseases. In this review, we discuss recent reports on the role of PARylation in mediating diverse cellular functions and homeostasis, such as DNA repair, inflammation, metabolism, and cell death.
