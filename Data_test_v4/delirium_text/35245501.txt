35245501|t|Recent structural insights into the mechanism of ClpP protease regulation by AAA+ chaperones and small molecules.
35245501|a|ClpP is a highly conserved serine protease that is a critical enzyme in maintaining protein homeostasis and is an important drug target in pathogenic bacteria and various cancers. In its functional form, ClpP is a self-compartmentalizing protease composed of two stacked heptameric rings that allow protein degradation to occur within the catalytic chamber. ATPase chaperones such as ClpX and ClpA are hexameric ATPases that form larger complexes with ClpP and are responsible for the selection and unfolding of protein substrates prior to their degradation by ClpP. Although individual structures of ClpP and ATPase chaperones have offered mechanistic insights into their function and regulation, their structures together as a complex have only been recently determined to high resolution. Here, we discuss the cryoelectron microscopy structures of ClpP-ATPase complexes and describe findings previously inaccessible from individual Clp structures, including how a hexameric ATPase and a tetradecameric ClpP protease work together in a functional complex. We then discuss the consensus mechanism for substrate unfolding and translocation derived from these structures, consider alternative mechanisms, and present their strengths and limitations. Finally, new insights into the allosteric control of ClpP gained from studies using small molecules and gain or loss-of-function mutations are explored. Overall, this review aims to underscore the multilayered regulation of ClpP that may present novel ideas for structure-based drug design.
