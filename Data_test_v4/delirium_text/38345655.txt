38345655|t|Assessment of quadriceps muscle mass by ultrasound in the postoperative period of cardiac surgery.
38345655|a|BACKGROUND: Patients undergoing cardiac surgery are exposed to many factors that activate catabolic and inflammatory pathways, which affect skeletal muscle and are, therefore, related to unfavorable hospital outcomes. Given the limited information on the behavior of muscle mass in critically ill patients, the objective of this study was to evaluate the impact on quantitative and qualitative measurements of quadriceps muscle mass using ultrasound after cardiac surgery. To accomplish this, a prospective, descriptive, and correlational study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital. Quadriceps muscle mass was evaluated via ultrasound in 31 adult patients in the postoperative period of cardiac surgery, with daily follow-up until postoperative day 7, as well as an assessment of associations with negative outcomes at 28 days. RESULTS: A 16% reduction in the cross-sectional area of the rectus femoris was found (95% CI 4.2-3.5 cm2; p 0.002), as well as a 24% reduction in the pennation angle of the rectus femoris (95% CI 11.1-8.4 degrees; p: 0.025). However, changes in the thickness of the rectus femoris, vastus internus, vastus lateralis, the length of the fascicle of the vastus lateralis, the pennation angle of the vastus lateralis, the sarcopenia index, and the Hekmat score were not statistically significant. There was no significant association between quadriceps muscle mass measurements and Intensive Care Unit (ICU) length stay or 28-day mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Patients in the postoperative period of cardiac surgery evaluated by ultrasound exhibit both quantitative and qualitative changes in quadriceps muscle mass. A significant reduction in muscle mass is observed but this is not associated with unfavorable outcomes.
