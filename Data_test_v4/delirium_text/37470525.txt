37470525|a|Objective: Evaluate the effects of ketamine versus propofol when used for induction of anesthesia in elderly, high-risk cardiac surgical patients on postoperative complications including cognitive dysfunction, delirium, and acute kidney injury. Methods: Prospective, randomized study performed at a tertiary medical center. A total of 52 patients aged >=70 and older presenting for complex cardiac surgery were randomized to receive either ketamine or propofol for induction of anesthesia. Patients underwent a battery of cognitive testing preoperatively and postoperatively and the incidence of delirium and acute kidney injury were measured. Norepinephrine (NEE) equivalents following induction were assessed for each group. Results: A total of 49 patients were included, 25 in the ketamine group and 24 in the propofol group with 3 patients excluded from the analysis. No difference was found between groups in either postoperative cognitive dysfunction or delirium incidence. Acute kidney injury occurred in 6 (24%) patients in the ketamine group in 12 (50%) patients in the propofol group, but the difference did not meet statistical significance (P = 0.08; Relative Risk = 2.1, 95% CI 0.9-4.7). NEE equivalents were lower in the ketamine group, 9.6 +- 22.2 versus 32.7 +- 46.0, P < 0.03. Conclusions: The use of ketamine versus propofol for induction of anesthesia did not impact the incidence of postoperative cognitive dysfunction or delirium. Twice as many patients in the propofol group developed acute kidney injury, although not reaching statistical significance and warranting further investigation. In elderly, high-risk patients, ketamine was associated with a significantly reduced need for vasopressor support following induction.
