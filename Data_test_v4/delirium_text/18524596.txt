18524596|a|OBJECTIVE: Delirium is a frequent and serious problem in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Several international guidelines recommend daily monitoring for ICU-delirium. The purpose of this article is to give an up-to-date overview of the current status of monitoring and treatment of ICU-delirium in the Netherlands. DESIGN: Nation-wide, telephone-based questionnaire survey. PARTICIPANTS: Head nurse of all ICUs and a random sample of intensivists. RESULTS: Only 14% (n=14) of all Dutch ICUs (n=103) monitored for ICU-delirium. Of these, only half (7%) used a tool that is validated in ICU patients. In 31% of Dutch ICUs, a protocol was used to treat ICU-delirium. Responses were obtained from 100% of ICUs. CONCLUSION: Despite an international guideline, not more than 7% of ICUs in our study routinely evaluated the presence of delirium with a validated instrument. Fewer than one-third of Dutch ICUs use a protocol to treat ICU-delirium.
