33763183|t|A Retrospective Review of Morbidity and Mortality Associated with Acute Benzodiazepine Withdrawal at a Midwestern Academic Medical Center.
33763183|a|INTRODUCTION: There is concern that acute benzodiazepine (BZD) withdrawal may result in morbidity and mortality. However, there is a paucity of medical literature regarding clinical characteristics and outcomes of acute BZD withdrawal. We sought to characterize acute BZD withdrawal and its associated clinical outcomes and treatment at a midwestern academic medical center. METHODS: This was a retrospective study. The medical records of the University of Kansas Hospital, a tertiary academic medical center, were queried for patients with a diagnosis of BZD withdrawal, drug withdrawal, sedative-hypnotic withdrawal, or withdrawal-NOS from January 1, 2009 to January 1, 2016. Data collected included age, sex, month/year of encounter, initial vital signs, type of drug withdrawal (alcohol, opioid, BZD, or other), type of BZD withdrawing from, disposition, duration of hospitalization, seizures, endotracheal intubation, mortality, and pharmacological treatment. RESULTS: Eighty-two cases were identified. Cases per year increased over the study period. Thirty-one (38%) cases involved concurrent drug withdrawal with opioids most common (n = 25). Alprazolam (n = 32) was the most common BZD implicated in BZD withdrawal. Thirty-nine cases (47%) were admitted including seven to the ICU. Seizures were reported in 8 (10%) cases. Endotracheal intubation occurred in three (3.6%). Sixty-seven patients (81%) were treated with a BZD, with lorazepam (n = 42) most used. There were no deaths. Upon discharge, 40 (49%) patients received a prescription for a benzodiazepine. CONCLUSIONS: Cases of acute BZD withdrawal increased over the study period but were associated with only occasional morbidity and no mortality. Further multi-center studies are warranted to characterize the incidence and characteristics of acute BZD withdrawal better.
