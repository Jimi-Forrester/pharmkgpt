16764936|t|The X11/Mint family of adaptor proteins.
16764936|a|The X11 protein family are multidomain proteins composed of a conserved PTB domain and two C-terminal PDZ domains. They are involved in formation of multiprotein complexes and two of the family members, X11alpha and X11beta, are expressed primarily in neurones. Not much is known about the principal function of X11s, but through interactions with other neuronal proteins, they are believed to be involved in regulating neuronal signaling, trafficking and plasticity. Furthermore, they have been shown to modulate processing of APP and accumulation of Abeta, making them potential therapeutic targets for Alzheimer's disease. This article reviews the known interactions of the different X11s and their involvement in Alzheimer's disease.
