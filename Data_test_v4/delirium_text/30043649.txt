30043649|a|AIM: The aim of present study is to investigate the relationship between gut microbiota and Alzheimer's disease (AD) using Drosophila model. MATERIALS & METHODS: The microbiota was characterized by Illumina sequencing of 16S rRNA gene. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometer was performed to measure the level of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), metabolites of the commensal microbiota. RESULTS: The diversity of the gut microbiota increased in AD Drosophila. As the most enriched bacteria at genus level, the proportions of Acetobacter and Lactobacillus decreased dramatically. Acetate was the most abundant SCFA derived from the dysregulated microbiota and markedly downregulated in AD Drosophila. CONCLUSION: Our study on Drosophila model suggests that dysregulation of gut microbiota may participate in AD pathogenesis by influencing SCFA level.
