35882973|a|Although the regular administration of antihypertensive drugs is a risk factor for falls in older adults, whether their anti-inflammatory effects confer a survival benefit in older adults remains unknown. This single-center retrospective cohort study examined patients with trauma aged >= 65 admitted to our hospital between January 2018 and December 2020. Patients who had not received antihypertensive drugs before admission (i.e., AHT(-) group) and those who had received the drugs (i.e., AHT(+) group) were compared using a 1:1 propensity score-matched analysis. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, and the secondary outcomes were in-hospital mortality and the incidence of complications during the hospital stay. In total, 637 patients were analyzed. After propensity score matching, each study group had 223 patients. No significant difference was observed in the primary outcome (28-day mortality: AHT(-) group, 3.6% vs. AHT(+) group, 3.6%; adjusted relative risk: 1.00, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.38-2.62); only the in-hospital incidence of delirium was significantly low in the AHT(+) group (25.1% vs. 13.9%; adjusted relative risk: 0.55, 95% CI: 0.37-0.82). Overall, the regular use of antihypertensive drugs did not affect outcomes in geriatric trauma patients; however, the incidence of delirium was reduced in those regularly receiving antihypertensive drugs.
