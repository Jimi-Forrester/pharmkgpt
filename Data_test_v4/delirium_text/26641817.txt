26641817|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Abnormalities of oculomotor control accompany the pathological changes underlying many neurodegenerative diseases. Clinical examination of eye movements can contribute to differential diagnosis, whereas quantitative laboratory measures can provide detailed insight into the disease process. In this review of eye movements in neurodegenerative disease, we summarise recent empirical findings and conceptual advances. RECENT FINDINGS: Oculomotor researchers continue to be particularly prolific in studying Parkinson's disease but there is also substantial activity in Alzheimer's disease and spinocerebellar ataxia. Interesting findings have been reported in Huntington's, motor neuron disease, and glaucoma. Most studies report laboratory-based investigations but useful progress in clinical description continues to be made. SUMMARY: Eye movements remain an active field of investigation across a variety of neurodegenerative conditions. Progress continues to be made at the clinical level as well by using laboratory techniques.
