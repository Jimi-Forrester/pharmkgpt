38283784|t|Molecular Insights into Cu/Zn Metal Response to the Amyloid beta-Peptide (1-42).
38283784|a|Abeta1-40 peptide and Abeta1-42 peptide are the building units of beta-amyloid plaques present in Alzheimer's disease (AD)-affected brain. The binding affinity of various divalent metal ions such as Cu and Zn present in AD-affected brain with different amino acids available in Abeta-peptide became the focus to explore their role in soluble neurotoxic oligomer formation. Cu2+ metal ions are known to enhance the neurotoxicity of the Abeta1-42 peptide by catalyzing the formation of soluble neurotoxic oligomers. The competitive preference of both Cu2+ and Zn2+ simultaneously to interact with the Abeta-peptide is unknown. The divalent Cu and Zn ions were inserted in explicit aqueous Abeta1-42 peptide configurations to get insights into the binding competence of these metal ions with peptides using classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The metal-ion interactions reveal that competitive binding preferences of various peptide sites become metal-ion-specific and differ significantly. For Cu2+, interactions are found to be more significant with respect to those of Asp-7, His-6, Glu-11, and His-14. Asp-1, Glu-3, Asp-7, His-6, Glu-11, and His-13 amino acid residues show higher affinity toward Zn2+ ions. MD simulations show notable variation in the solvent-accessible surface area in the hydrophobic region of the peptide. Infinitesimal mobility was obtained for Zn2+ compared to Cu2+ in an aqueous solution and Cu2+ diffusivity deviated significantly at different time scales, proving its labile features in aqueous Abeta1-42 peptides.
