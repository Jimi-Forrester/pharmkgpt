38863776|t|The Role of Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR) in Urosepsis-Associated Delirium.
38863776|a|Introduction Urosepsis is a systemic, dysregulated, inflammatory reaction to a urinary tract infection and can have severe effects on all systems, which can often lead to multi-organ failure and death. Sepsis-associated delirium is a common complication in critically ill patients, contributing to adverse outcomes and prolonged hospital stays. The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) has emerged as a potential biomarker for sepsis severity and prognosis. Material and methods Our study investigates the utility of NLR in the diagnostic strategies for urosepsis-associated delirium in a cohort of 76 patients with sepsis and septic shock admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). We performed a single-centre retrospective observational study in the Craiova Clinical Emergency Hospital between June and October 2023. Results Patients with urological conditions that were diagnosed with urosepsis included 76 patients. These patients were clustered as follows: a group with delirium (37 patients, 48.7%) and another group without delirium (39 patients, 51.3%). Complete blood count parameters were obtained upon admission, and delirium was assessed using standardized diagnostic criteria. We identified a strong significant positive correlation between elevated NLR values on ICU admission and the development of delirium during hospitalization in urosepsis patients. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis showed similar diagnostic performance for NLR score. Conclusions The findings suggest that NLR may serve as a valuable biomarker for early detection, risk stratification, and guiding therapeutic interventions in urosepsis-associated delirium, thus improving outcomes in critically ill patients.
