37511307|t|Biochemical and Anthropometric Parameters for the Early Recognition of the Intrauterine Growth Restriction and Preterm Neonates at Risk of Impaired Neurodevelopment.
37511307|a|BACKGROUND: S100B and Tau are implicated with both brain growth and injury. Their urinary levels in 30-to-40-day-old full-term, preterm, IUGR, and preterm-IUGR subjects were measured to investigate their possible relationship with future delayed neurodevelopment. METHODS: Values were related to the neuro-behavioral outcome at two years of age, as well as to brain volumes and urinary NGF assessed at the same postnatal time point. RESULTS: Using the Griffiths III test, cognitive and motor performances were determined to establish subgroups characterized by either normal or impaired neuro-behavior. The latter included preterm, IUGR, and preterm-IUGR individuals who exhibited significantly higher and lower S100B and Tau levels, respectively, along with markedly reduced cerebral volumes and urinary NGF, as previously demonstrated. Contrary to NGF, however, Tau and S100B displayed a weak correlation with brain volumes. CONCLUSIONS: Delayed cognitive and motor performances observed in two-year-old preterm and IUGR-born individuals were also found to be associated with anomalous urinary levels of S100B and Tau, assessed at 30-40 days of the postnatal period, and their changes did not correlate with brain growth. Thus, our data suggests that, in addition to cerebral volumes and NGF, urinary S100B and Tau can also be considered as valuable parameters for the early detection of future neurodevelopmental abnormalities.
