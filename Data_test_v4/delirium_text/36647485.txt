36647485|t|Clinical characteristics and survival of esophageal cancer patients: annual report of the surgical treatment in Shanghai Chest Hospital, 2016.
36647485|a|Background: Esophageal cancers present a significant burden of disease and remain one of the most lethal of cancers worldwide, particular in China. Surgical treatment remains the cornerstone of esophageal cancers, and a real-world data from a high-volume esophageal cancer center have guiding significance in evaluation of the current clinical practice. This report describes the clinical characteristics, treatment outcomes, and survival of surgical treatment in patients with esophageal cancer in Shanghai Chest Hospital (SCH). Methods: All patients diagnosed with esophageal cancer who received esophagectomy or endoscopic resection at SCH in 2016 were included in this study. The baseline characteristics, treatment-related outcomes, and follow-up data were collated from the medical records and a prospectively maintained database. The clinicopathological characteristics, surgical complications, and oncologic outcomes were summarized. Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate their survival and Cox regression model was used to estimate the associated risk factors. Results: In 2016, a total of 546 patients with esophageal cancer received surgical or endoscopic resection at SCH (including 517 esophagectomies and 29 endoscopic resections). Most patients (52.4%) were between 60-69 years old, 79.5% were male, and for more than half of all patients (51.3%), the tumor was located at the middle thoracic esophagus. Overall, 11.0% (60/546) of patients received neoadjuvant therapy and 45.8% (250/546) of patients were treated with adjuvant therapy. Minimally invasive esophagectomy (including thoracoscopy and robot-assisted) was performed in 58.0% of patients and the R0 resection rate was 90.3%. The postoperative 30- and 90-day mortality was 0.73% and 1.1%, respectively. For the esophagectomy cohort, the 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-year overall survival (OS) rates were 86.5%, 67.8%, 59.9%, 54.5%, 51.8%, and for cancer specific survival (CSS), the rates were 91.8%, 74.2%, 66.6%, 61.2%, and 59.1%, respectively. Conclusions: Through a standardized surgical procedure, the short- and long-term outcomes of patients with esophageal cancer were acceptable with good safety and oncological control in a high-volume center in China. This study reveals important surgical treatment effects of esophageal cancer patients and contributes to improvement of clinical management and future treatment development.
