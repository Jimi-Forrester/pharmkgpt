11389903|t|Catalytic activity of ADAM28.
11389903|a|ADAMs are membrane-anchored glycoproteins containing a disintegrin and metalloprotease domain that have important roles in fertilization, development, and diseases such as Alzheimer's dementia. Here we present the first evidence for catalytic activity of ADAM28, a protein that is highly expressed in the epididymis and lymphocytes. Recombinant ADAM28 cleaves myelin basic protein at two sites. The catalytic activity of ADAM28 is not sensitive to tissue inhibitors of metalloproteases 1 and 2, but can be abolished by a mutation in the catalytic site. Catalytically active ADAM28 will be valuable for further studies of its role in sperm maturation and lymphocyte function.
