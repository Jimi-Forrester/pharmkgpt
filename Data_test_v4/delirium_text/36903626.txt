36903626|t|The Chemopreventive Effects of Chlorogenic Acids, Phenolic Compounds in Coffee, against Inflammation, Cancer, and Neurological Diseases.
36903626|a|Coffee is one of the most widely consumed beverages, which has several effects on the human body. In particular, current evidence suggests that coffee consumption is associated with a reduced risk of inflammation, various types of cancers, and certain neurodegenerative diseases. Among the various constituents of coffee, phenolic phytochemicals, more specifically chlorogenic acids, are the most abundant, and there have been many attempts to utilize coffee chlorogenic acid for cancer prevention and therapy. Due to its beneficial biological effect on the human body, coffee is regarded as a functional food. In this review article, we summarize the recent advances and knowledge on the association of phytochemicals contained in coffee as nutraceuticals, with a particular focus on phenolic compounds, their intake, and nutritional biomarkers, with the reduction of disease risk, including inflammation, cancer, and neurological diseases.
