37575817|t|An Unusual Case of Post-Operative Functional Stridor After Emergence From General Anesthesia.
37575817|a|Post-anesthesia stridor due to laryngospasm, laryngeal edema, or any other organic cause is a life-threatening condition requiring immediate intervention. The very rare functional stridor or psychogenic stridor following emergence from general anesthesia may sometimes mimic stridor due to an organic cause, but it is neither fatal nor require immediate airway management. However, if the condition is not diagnosed timely, it may lead to unnecessary manipulation of the airway, such as endotracheal intubation or tracheostomy. We report herein a case of functional stridor in a 48-year-old woman who underwent abdominal-perineal resection for carcinoma rectum. The case was timely diagnosed by the attending anesthetist, and the patient recovered spontaneously, thus avoiding any unindicated airway handling and its associated complications.
