34270750|t|LATE Neuropathologic Changes with Little or No Alzheimer Disease is Common and is Associated with Cognitive Impairment but Not Frontotemporal Dementia.
34270750|a|Limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy neuropathologic changes (LATE-NC) often occur in aged brains that also contain appreciable Alzheimer disease neuropathologic changes (ADNC). Question has arisen as to whether LATE-NC can occur independently of ADNC. We evaluated data from the University of Kentucky Alzheimer's Disease Research Center autopsy cohort (383 included subjects) to address 2 questions: (i) Is LATE-NC seen in the absence of ADNC, outside of persons who had the frontotemporal dementia (FTD) clinical syndrome? and (ii) is LATE-NC associated with cognitive impairment across the full spectrum of ADNC severity? In the present study, the pathologic combination of LATE-NC (Stage >1) and low/no ADNC was common: 8.9% (34/383) of all subjects (including demented and non-demented individuals) showed this combination. There were no FTLD-TDP cases to be included from the community-based cohort. Across a broad range of ADNC severity, the presence of LATE-NC was associated with impaired cognition but was never associated with a FTD clinical syndrome.
