37038823|a|BACKGROUND: Three therapeutic strategies have radically changed the therapeutic scenario for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). However, therapeutic response differs between individuals. There is a need to identify biomarkers to further assess therapeutic response and to better understand which variables determine the extent of response. METHODS: We conducted a study using an optimized digital droplet PCR-based method for the ultra-sensitive detection of SMN transcript in serum EVs from SMA 2 individuals treated with nusinersen over 14 months. In parallel, we investigated levels of serum and CSF neurofilament heavy chain (pNF-H) in the same cohort. RESULTS: Expression of flSMN transcript in EVs of SMA 2 individuals prior to nusinersen was lower than in controls (0.40 vs 2.79 copies/ul; p <  0.05) and increased after 14 months of nusinersen (0.40 vs 1.11 copies/ul; p <  0.05). The increase in flSMN with nusinersen was significantly higher in younger individuals (p <  0.05). Serum pNF-h was higher in non-treated individuals with SMA 2 than in controls (230.72 vs 22.88 pg/ml; p <  0.05) and decreased with nusinersen (45.72 pg/ml at 6 months, 39.02 pg/ml at 14 months). CSF pNF-h in SMA 2 individuals also decreased with nusinersen (248.04 pg/ml prior to treatment, 197.10 pg/dl at 2 months, 104.43 pg/dl at 6 months, 131.03 pg/dl at 14 months). CONCLUSIONS: We identified an increase decline of flSMN transcript in serum EVs of SMA 2 individuals treated with nusinersen that was more pronounced in the younger individuals. Our results indicate that flSMN transcript expression in serum EVs is a possible biomarker in SMA to predict or monitor the response to treatment.
