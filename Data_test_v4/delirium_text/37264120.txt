37264120|t|Does modulation of tau hyperphosphorylation represent a reasonable therapeutic strategy for Alzheimer's disease? From preclinical studies to the clinical trials.
37264120|a|Protein kinases (PKs) have emerged as one of the most intensively investigated drug targets in current pharmacological research, with indications ranging from oncology to neurodegeneration. Tau protein hyperphosphorylation was the first pathological post-translational modification of tau protein described in Alzheimer's disease (AD), highlighting the role of PKs in neurodegeneration. The therapeutic potential of protein kinase inhibitors (PKIs)) and protein phosphatase 2 A (PP2A) activators in AD has recently been explored in several preclinical and clinical studies with variable outcomes. Where a number of preclinical studies demonstrate a visible reduction in the levels of phospho-tau in transgenic tauopathy models, no reduction in neurofibrillary lesions is observed. Amongst the few PKIs and PP2A activators that progressed to clinical trials, most failed on the efficacy front, with only a few still unconfirmed and potential positive trends. This suggests that robust preclinical and clinical data is needed to unequivocally evaluate their efficacy. To this end, we take a systematic look at the results of preclinical and clinical studies of PKIs and PP2A activators, and the evidence they provide regarding the utility of this approach to evaluate the potential of targeting tau hyperphosphorylation as a disease modifying therapy.
