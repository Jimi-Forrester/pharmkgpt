27853903|a|The prevalence of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease are increased by age. Alleviation of their symptoms and protection of normal neurons against degeneration are the main aspects of the research to establish novel therapeutic strategies. Iron as the one of most important cation not only play important role in the structure of electron transport chain proteins but also has pivotal duties in cellular activities. But disruption in iron hemostasis can make it toxin to neurons which causes lipid peroxidation, DNA damage and etc. In patients with Alzheimer and Parkinson misbalancing in iron homeostasis accelerate neurodegeneration and cause neuroinflmmation. mTOR as the common signaling pathway between cancer and neurodegenerative disorders controls iron uptake and it is in active form in both diseases. Anti-cancer drugs which target mTOR causes iron deficiency and dual effects of mTOR inhibitors can candidate them as a therapeutic strategy to alleviate neurodegeneration/inflammation because of iron overloading.
