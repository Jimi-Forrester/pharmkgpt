31332445|a|The failure of recent clinical trials in Alzheimer's disease has highlighted the need for the development of a more complete understanding of the pathogenesis of the disorder and also a belief that therapies may only work if given very early in the disease process before overt symptoms occur. The rare, early onset forms of the disease are all caused by mutations which make amyloid deposition a more likely event. Here we discuss the recent data showing that, in contrast, much of the risk of late onset disease is encoded by loci involved in lipid metabolism and/or encoded by microglia. We discuss these finding and suggest that amyloid induced membrane damage may be a key factor in disease and also review the evidence that genome wide genetic analysis can substantially help in the prediction of those individuals at high risk of disease in the general population.
