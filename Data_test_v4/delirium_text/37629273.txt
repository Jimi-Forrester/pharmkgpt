37629273|a|The association and interaction between the central nervous system (CNS) and enteric nervous system (ENS) is well established. Essentially ENS is the second brain, as we call it. We tried to understand the structure and function, to throw light on the functional aspect of neurons, and address various disease manifestations. We summarized how various neurological disorders influence the gut via the enteric nervous system and/or bring anatomical or physiological changes in the enteric nervous system or the gut and vice versa. It is known that stress has an effect on Gastrointestinal (GI) motility and causes mucosal erosions. In our literature review, we found that stress can also affect sensory perception in the central nervous system. Interestingly, we found that mutations in the neurohormone, serotonin (5-HT), would result in dysfunctional organ development and further affect mood and behavior. We focused on the developmental aspects of neurons and cognition and their relation to nutritional absorption via the gastrointestinal tract, the development of neurodegenerative disorders in relation to the alteration in gut microbiota, and contrariwise associations between CNS disorders and ENS. This paper further summarizes the synergetic relation between gastrointestinal and neuropsychological manifestations and emphasizes the need to include behavioral therapies in management plans.
