Sleep disorder has been proposed as an early sign of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) in Alzheimer's disease. Although several clinical studies have been conducted to assess sleep and association with early MCI, reliable and efficient algorithms to detect MCI in home-based sleep studies are needed in order to address both healthcare costs and patient discomfort in hospital/lab-based sleep studies. METHODS: In this paper, an innovative MCI detection method is proposed using an overnight recording of movements associated with sleep combined with advanced signal processing and artificial intelligence. A new diagnostic parameter is introduced which is extracted from the correlation between high frequency, sleep-related movements and respiratory changes during sleep. The newly defined parameter, Time-Lag (TL), is proposed as a distinguishing criterion that indicates movement stimulation of brainstem respiratory regulation that may modulate hypoxemia risk during sleep and serve as an effective parameter for early detection of MCI in ADRD. By implementing Neural Networks (NN) and Kernel algorithms with choosing TL as the principle component in MCI detection, high sensitivity ( 86.75% for NN and 65% for Kernel method), specificity ( 89.25% and 100%), and accuracy ( 88% and 82.5%) have been achieved.
