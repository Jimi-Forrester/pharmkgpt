23436150|a|Presenilins (PSs) are catalytic components of the gamma-secretase complex that produces Abeta peptides. Substrates of gamma-secretase are membrane-bound protein fragments deriving from the cleavage of extracellular sequence of cell surface proteins. APP-derived gamma-secretase substrates are cleaved at gamma (gamma) sites to produce Abeta while cleavage at the epsilon (epsilon) site produces AICD proposed to function in transcription. In addition to APP, gamma-secretase promotes the epsilon-cleavage of a large number of cell surface proteins producing cytosolic peptides shown to function in cell signaling. A common hypothesis suggests that Alzheimer's disease (AD) is caused by Abeta peptides or their products. Treatment of patients with inhibitors of Abeta production however, showed no therapeutic benefits while inducing cytotoxicity. Similarly, treatments with anti-Abeta antibodies yielded disappointing results. Importantly, recent evidence shows that PS familial AD (FAD) mutations cause a loss of gamma-secretase cleavage activity at epsilon site of substrates thus inhibiting production of biologically important cell signaling peptides while promoting accumulation of membrane-bound cytotoxic substrates. These data support a hypothesis that FAD mutations may increase neurotoxicity by inhibiting the gamma-secretase-catalyzed epsilon cleavage of substrates thus interfering with cell signaling while also promoting accumulation of cytotoxic peptides. Similar mechanisms may explain gamma-secretase inhibitor-associated toxicities observed in clinical trials. Here we discuss evidence that FAD neurodegeneration may be caused by loss of gamma-secretase cleavage function at epsilon sites of substrates.
