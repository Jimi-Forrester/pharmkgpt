38003263|t|Multi-Omics Analysis of Circulating Exosomes in Adherent Long-Term Treated OSA Patients.
38003263|a|Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a highly prevalent chronic disease affecting nearly a billion people globally and increasing the risk of multi-organ morbidity and overall mortality. However, the mechanisms underlying such adverse outcomes remain incompletely delineated. Extracellular vesicles (exosomes) are secreted by most cells, are involved in both proximal and long-distance intercellular communication, and contribute toward homeostasis under physiological conditions. A multi-omics integrative assessment of plasma-derived exosomes from adult OSA patients prior to and after 1-year adherent CPAP treatment is lacking. We conducted multi-omic integrative assessments of plasma-derived exosomes from adult OSA patients prior to and following 1-year adherent CPAP treatment to identify potential specific disease candidates. Fasting morning plasma exosomes isolated from 12 adult patients with polysomnographically-diagnosed OSA were analyzed before and after 12 months of adherent CPAP therapy (mean >= 6 h/night) (OSAT). Exosomes were characterized by flow cytometry, transmission electron microscopy, and nanoparticle tracking analysis. Endothelial cell barrier integrity, wound healing, and tube formation were also performed. Multi-omics analysis for exosome cargos was integrated. Exosomes derived from OSAT improved endothelial permeability and dysfunction as well as significant improvement in tube formation compared with OSA. Multi-omic approaches for OSA circulating exosomes included lipidomic, proteomic, and small RNA (miRNAs) assessments. We found 30 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs), 72 lipids (DELs), and 13 miRNAs (DEMs). We found that the cholesterol metabolism (has04979) pathway is associated with lipid classes in OSA patients. Among the 12 subjects of OSA and OSAT, seven subjects had complete comprehensive exosome cargo information including lipids, proteins, and miRNAs. Multi-omic approaches identify potential signature biomarkers in plasma exosomes that are responsive to adherent OSA treatment. These differentially expressed molecules may also play a mechanistic role in OSA-induced morbidities and their reversibility. Our data suggest that a multi-omic integrative approach might be useful in understanding how exosomes function, their origin, and their potential clinical relevance, all of which merit future exploration in the context of relevant phenotypic variance. Developing an integrated molecular classification should lead to improved diagnostic classification, risk stratification, and patient management of OSA by assigning molecular disease-specific therapies.
