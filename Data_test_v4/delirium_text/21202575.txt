21202575|t|1-Phenyl-6,7,8,9-hexa-hydro-1H,5H-cyclo-hepta-[1',2':2,3]pyrido[6,5-c]pyrazol-4-amine: a new tacrine analogue.
21202575|a|The title compound, C(17)H(18)N(4), contains a pyrazolopyridine system fused with a seven-membered carbocyclic ring. The pyrazole ring is coplanar with the pyridine ring, while the phenyl ring is twisted by a dihedral angle of 14.38 (14)  with respect to the pyridine ring. The seven-membered ring displays a chair conformation. The packing is stabilized by N-H N hydrogen bonds and N-H pi(arene) inter-actions.
