30816172|t|Hyper-acidic fusion minipeptides escort the intrinsic antioxidative ability of the pattern recognition receptor CRP in non-animal organisms.
30816172|a|C-reactive protein (CRP) is widely used as a biomarker of inflammation. It plays important roles in innate immunity response as a member of pattern recognition receptors, by binding oxidation-specific epitopes including some intermediates of lipid oxidative chain reaction. The inferred antioxidative ability of CRP was ever demonstrated by only few in vitro evidences, and needs to be clarified especially in vivo. Herein, we expressed human CRP in three representative non-animal organisms (Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and tobacco) inherently lacking the milieu for CRP signalling, and found CRP did possess an intrinsic antioxidative ability. Heterologous CRP could confer increased oxidative resistance in its recombinant E. coli and yeast cells and transgenic tobaccos. We also revealed a positive correlation between the antioxidative effect of CRP and its solubility. Only soluble CRP could exhibit distinct antioxidative activity, while the CRP aggregates might be instead toxic (probably pro-oxidative) to cells. Moreover, fusion with hyper-acidic minipeptides could remarkably improve CRP solubility, and meanwhile guarantee or enhance CRP antioxidative ability. These results not only provide a new insight for understanding the etiology of CRP-involved inflammations and diseases, and also endorse a potential of CRP biotechnological applications in developing new pharmaceutical therapies and improving plant oxidative resistance.
