OBJECTIVE: We would explore whether blood levels of NfL and TDP-43 could predict the long-term progression to dementia, and the relationship of TDP-43 levels between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood. METHODS: A total of 86 non-dementia elderly received 7-year follow-up, and were divided into 49 stable normal control (NC)/mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects, 19 subjects progressing from NC to MCI, and 18 subjects progressing from NC/MCI to dementia. Blood TDP-43 and NfL levels, and cognitive functions were measured in all subjects. Furthermore, another cohort of 23 dementia patients, including 13 AD and 10 non-AD patients received blood and CSF measurements of TDP-43. RESULTS: In cohort 1, compared to stable NC/MCI group, there were higher levels of blood TDP-43 at baseline in subjects progressing from NC/MCI to dementia. The combination of baseline blood TDP-43 levels with demographics including age, education, and diabetes had the detection for dementia occurrence. Baseline blood levels of NfL are negatively associated with cognitive function at 7-year follow-up. In cohort 2, we found there were no relationship between CSF and blood levels of TDP-43. Moreover, the levels of TDP-43 in CSF was positively associated with the age of patients, especially in AD group. CONCLUSION: Single blood TDP-43 could not estimate dementia occurrence; however, TDP-43 combined with demographics has the predictive effect for dementia occurrence and NfL level is associated with a decrease of cognitive function.
