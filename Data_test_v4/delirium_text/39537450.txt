39537450|t|Neonatal delirium.
39537450|a|Delirium is a common and serious complication of critical illness that has been increasingly recognized in pediatric patients. There have been several published cases of delirium in newborns and infants over the last decade, though research on neonatal delirium is severely lacking. The true prevalence of delirium and its associated consequences in this population remain unknown, although the risk of delirium in this population appears to be elevated compared to older youth. The current approach to management of delirium in neonates is extrapolated from older children. In the present review, the pathophysiology and clinical presentation of delirium are outlined. Strategies for prevention, evaluation, and management of delirium in neonates are explored.
