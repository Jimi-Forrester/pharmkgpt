METHODS: Eighty patients within 7 days of acute ischemic stroke and 35 age- and sex-matched controls were enrolled. In the patients with stroke, brain magnetic resonance imaging and dynamic CA were obtained at baseline, and dynamic CA was followed up at 3 months and 1 year. Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was performed at 3 months and 1 year. Patients with a MoCA score <23 at 1 year were defined as having PSCI, and those with a MoCA score that decreased by 2 points or more between the 3-month and 1-year assessments were defined as having progressive cognitive decline. RESULTS: In total, 65 patients completed the study and 16 developed PSCI. The patients with PSCI exhibited poorer results for all cognitive domains than did those without PSCI. The patients with PSCI also had poorer CA (lower phase shift between cerebral blood flow and blood pressure waveforms in the very low frequency band) compared with that of the patients without PSCI and controls at baseline and 1 year. CA was not different between the patients without PSCI and controls. In the multivariate analysis, low education level, lobar microbleeds, and impaired CA (very low frequency phase shift [<=46 ] within 7 days of stroke), were independently associated with PSCI. In addition, impaired CA was associated with progressive cognitive decline. INTERPRETATION: Low education level, lobar microbleeds, and impaired CA are involved in the pathogenesis of PSCI.
