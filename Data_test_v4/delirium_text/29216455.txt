29216455|t|Seeds of Destruction: New Mechanistic Insights into the Role of Apolipoprotein E4 in Alzheimer's Disease.
29216455|a|Apolipoprotein E4 (apoE4) is the strongest genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. Despite nearly 25 years of research, the mechanism by which apoE4 confers increased risk for Alzheimer's disease remains enigmatic. In this issue of Neuron, Liu et al. (2017) and Huynh et al. (2017) shed new light on this important question.
