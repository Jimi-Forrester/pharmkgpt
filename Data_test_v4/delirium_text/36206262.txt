36206262|a|BACKGROUND: Malaria remains a major public health challenge in Africa where annually, ~250,000 children with malaria experience a neurologic injury with subsequent neuro-disability. Evidence indicates that a higher temperature during the acute illness is a risk factor for post-infectious neurologic sequelae. As such, aggressive antipyretic therapy may be warranted among children with complicated malaria at substantial risk of brain injury. Previous clinical trials conducted primarily in children with uncomplicated malaria and using only a single antipyretic medication have shown limited benefits in terms of fever reduction; however, no studies to date have examined malaria fever management using dual therapies. In this clinical trial of aggressive antipyretic therapy, children hospitalized with central nervous system (CNS) malaria will be randomized to usual care (acetaminophen every 6 hours for a temperature >= 38.5 C) vs. prophylactic acetaminophen and ibuprofen every 6 hours for 72 hours. METHODS: In this double-blinded, placebo controlled, two-armed clinical trial, we will enroll 284 participants from three settings at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in Blantyre, Malawi; at the University Teaching Hospitals Children's Hospital in Lusaka, Zambia and at Chipata Central Hospital, Chipata, Zambia. Parents or guardians must provide written informed consent. Eligible participants are 2-11 years with evidence of P. falciparum malaria infection by peripheral blood smear or rapid diagnostic test with CNS symptoms associated with malaria. Eligible children will receive treatment allocation randomization either to standard of care for fever management or to prophylactic, scheduled treatment every 6 hours for 72 hours with dual antipyretic therapies using acetaminophen and ibuprofen. Assignment to treatment groups will be with 1:1 allocation using blocked randomization. The primary outcome will be maximum temperature in the 72 hours after enrolment. Secondary outcomes include parasite clearance as determined by quantitative Histidine Rich Protein II and seizures through 72 hours after enrolment. DISCUSSION: This clinical trial seeks to challenge the practice paradigm of limited fever treatment based upon hyperpyrexia by evaluating the fever-reduction efficacy of more aggressive antipyretic using two antipyretics and prophylactic administration and will elucidate the impact of antipyretics on parasite clearance and acute symptomatic seizures. If aggressive antipyretic therapy is shown to safely reduce the maximum temperature, a clinical trial evaluating the neuroprotective effects of temperature reduction in CNS malaria is warranted.
