36479306|t|Upregulation of Glutaminyl Cyclase Contributes to ERS-Induced Apoptosis in PC12 Cells.
36479306|a|Glutaminyl cyclase (QC) is responsible for converting the N-terminal glutaminyl and glutamyl of the proteins into pyroglutamate (pE) through cyclization. It has been confirmed that QC catalyzes the formation of neurotoxic pE-modified Abeta in the brain of AD patients. But the effects of upregulated QC in diverse diseases have not been much clear until recently. Here, RNA sequencing was applied to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in PC12 cells with QC overexpressing or knockdown. A total of 697 DEGs were identified in QC overexpressing cells while only 77 in QC knockdown cells. Multiple bioinformatic approaches revealed that the DEGs in QC overexpressing group were enriched in endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) related signaling pathways. The gene expression patterns of 23 DEGs were confirmed by RT-qPCR, in which the genes related to ERS showed the highest consistency. We also revealed the protein levels of GRP78, PERK, CHOP, and PARP-1, and caspase family was significantly upregulated by overexpressing QC. Moreover, overexpressing QC significantly increased apoptosis of PC12 cells in a time dependent manner. However, no significant alteration was observed in QC knockdown cells. Therefore, our study indicated that upregulated QC could induce ERS and apoptosis, which consequently trigger diseases by catalyzing the generation of pE-modified mediators.
