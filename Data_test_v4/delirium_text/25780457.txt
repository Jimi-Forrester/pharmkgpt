25780457|a|The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of vitamins E (VE) and C (VC), combined with beta-carotene (beta-C), on cognitive function in the elderly. A total of 276 elderly subjects completed the prospective study following treatment with VE, VC and different doses of beta-C or with VE only. Cognitive function was assessed by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Hasegawa Dementia Scale (HDS) tests. The plasma levels of amyloid-beta (Abeta) and estradiol (E2) were determined by radioimmunoassay (RIA). Results from the MMSE and HDS assessments indicated that the treatment strategy of VE and VC combined with beta-C significantly improved cognitive function in the elderly subjects, particularly with higher doses of beta-C. Furthermore, RIA suggested that treatment with these vitamins could markedly reduce plasma Abeta levels and elevate plasma E2 levels. The present findings suggest that treatment with VE, VC and beta-C results in promising improvements in cognitive function in the elderly.
