33838306|t|Discovery of effective phosphodiesterase 2 inhibitors with antioxidant activities for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
33838306|a|The multi-target-directed-ligand (MTDL) strategy has been widely applied in the discovery of novel drugs for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) because of the multifactorial pathological mechanisms of AD. Phosphodiesterase-2 (PDE2) has been identified to be a novel and promising target for AD. However, MTDL combining with the inhibitory activity against PDE2A and other anti-AD factors such as antioxidants has not been developed yet. Herein, a novel series of PDE2 inhibitors with antioxidant capacities were designed, synthesized, and evaluated. Most compounds showed remarkable inhibitory activities against PDE2A as well as antioxidant activities. Compound 6d was selected, which showed good IC50 of 6.1 nM against PDE2A, good antioxidant activity (ORAC (Trolox) = 8.4 eq.) and no cytotoxicity to SH-SY5Y cells. Molecular docking and dynamics simulations were applied for the rational design and explanation of structure-activity relationship (SAR) of lead compounds.
