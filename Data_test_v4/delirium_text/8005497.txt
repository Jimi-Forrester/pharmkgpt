8005497|t|Sharing the caring: family caregivers' views of their relationships with nursing home staff.
8005497|a|Using data from focus groups and individual interviews with family caregivers who had a spouse or a parent with Alzheimer's disease, we examined their reports of interactions with staff in formal care settings. Families most often discussed nurses' aides; they emphasized their desire for an ongoing relationship with staff members; and, they interpreted staff behaviors in terms of high-quality care that was based on the social and emotional care given to their resident as much as on the technical tasks involved in caring for them. These results point to the families' desire for emotionally sensitive care and not just for technically competent performance of tasks.
