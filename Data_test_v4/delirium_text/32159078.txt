32159078|t|Prophylactic Right Ventricular Assist Device for High-Risk Patients Undergoing Valve Corrective Surgery.
32159078|a|BACKGROUND: Right ventricular failure (RVF) after cardiac surgery is associated with poor outcomes. Treatment commonly consists of afterload reduction, contractility optimization, and systemic vasopressors. The aim of this study was to propose a novel strategy of prophylactic right ventricular assist device (RVAD) insertion during valve corrective surgery for patients at high risk for RVF. METHODS: Between 2014 and 2017, 10 consecutive patients at high risk for RVF (severe baseline right ventricular dysfunction or systemic pulmonary artery pressures) underwent valve reconstructive surgery with prophylactic RVAD insertion. We reviewed patient characteristics and outcomes. RESULTS: All 10 patients had successful RVAD insertion, support and wean, and survival to hospital discharge. Generally, the right ventricle showed echocardiographic evidence of worsening function perioperatively but recovery of function at the time of follow-up. Patients required minimal inotropic support, and no patients required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Major complications included prolonged mechanical ventilation (n = 4), metabolic encephalopathy (n = 1), and sternal wound infection (n = 2). At a mean follow-up of 445.1 +- 230.9 days, 7 of 8 patients had clinically New York Heart Association functional class 1 (n = 7), and 1 patient had New York Heart Association functional class 2 (n = 1). There were 2 late mortalities. CONCLUSION: Prophylactic RVAD insertion may be useful in supporting patients at high risk for RVF perioperatively when undergoing high-risk valve corrective surgery. Further investigation is warranted.
