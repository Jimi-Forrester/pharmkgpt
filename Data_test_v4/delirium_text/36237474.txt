36237474|t|Susceptibility-Weighted Imaging as a Distinctive Imaging Technique for Providing Complementary Information for Precise Diagnosis of Neurologic Disorder.
36237474|a|Various sequences have been developed for MRI to aid in the radiologic diagnosis. Among the various MR sequences, susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) is a high-spatial-resolution, three-dimensional gradient-echo MR sequence, which is very sensitive in detecting deoxyhemoglobin, ferritin, hemosiderin, and bone minerals through local magnetic field distortion. In this regard, SWI has been used for the diagnosis and treatment of various neurologic disorders, and the improved image quality has enabled to acquire more useful information for radiologists. Here, we explain the principle of various signals on SWI arising in neurological disorders and provide a retrospective review of many cases of clinically or pathologically proven disease or components with distinctive imaging features of various neurological diseases. Additionally, we outline a short and condensed overview of principles of SWI in relation to neurological disorders and describe various cases with characteristic imaging features on SWI. There are many different types diseases involving the brain parenchyma, and they have distinct SWI features. SWI is an effective imaging tool that provides complementary information for the diagnosis of various diseases.
