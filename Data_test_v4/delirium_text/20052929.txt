MATERIAL, METHODS: We performed 38 LA between 2003-2008. We use computer tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the initial evaluation. Indication for procedure is made in cooperation with endocrinologist. We use transperitoneal approach with 3 or 5 ports. RESULTS: Mean age was 57.7 +/- 11.7 year (range 32-74.9 year). Nine LA were made in men (24%), in women 29 (76%). Sixteen tumours (42%) were hormonal active (7 pheochromocytoma, 6 primary hyperaldosteronism, 3 peripheral hypercortisolism). Twenty-two tumours were without hormonal activity. Mean tumour size was 4.1 +/- 2 cm (range 1-10.1 cm), mean operation time was 89 +/- 38 minutes (range 32-220 minutes), mean blood loss was 33 +/- 75 ml (range 0-400 ml), mean hospitalization time was 6.1 days (range 3-12 days). There were histologically 15 cortical adenomas, 5 nodular cortical hyperplasia, 1 calcificated hematoma, 3 cysts, 2 potentional malignant tumours on interface between adenoma and carcinoma, 1 cortical carcinoma and 7 pheochromocytoma. We found 3 metastases of renal carcinoma in adrenal gland and one metastasis mesenchymal chondrosarcoma too. Transperitoneal approach was chosen in 20 patients (53%) after previous abdominal operation (open cholecystectomy, appendectomy, transperitoneal nephrectomy, aortofemoral bypass). Complications were in 3 cases from 38 (8%). It was one perforation of diaphragm, which was resolve with laparoscopic suture, one postoperative delirium with fudge and agitation, one abscess in wound after extraction of specimen. We have got any conversion in our collection. The body mass index was higher than 38 in 3 patients. CONCLUSION: LA is a quick and safe procedure with minimal morbidity and mortality. This procedure requires very experienced surgeon. Patients profit especially from miniinvasivity and short convalescence. Especially benign tumours of smaller size (by 8 cm) are indicated, extensive and especially malignant tumours remain a domain of open approach. Previous operations in abdominal cavity do not have to be a contraindication for LA and operation is possible in patients with monster obesity.
