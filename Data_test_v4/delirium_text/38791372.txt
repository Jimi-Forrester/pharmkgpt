38791372|a|Mulberry is a rapidly growing plant that thrives in diverse climatic, topographical, and soil types, spanning temperature and temperate countries. Mulberry plants are valued as functional foods for their abundant chemical composition, serving as a significant reservoir of bioactive compounds like proteins, polysaccharides, phenolics, and flavonoids. Moreover, these compounds displayed potent antioxidant activity by scavenging free radicals, inhibiting reactive oxygen species generation, and restoring elevated nitric oxide production induced by LPS stimulation through the downregulation of inducible NO synthase expression. Active components like oxyresveratrol found in Morus demonstrated anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting leukocyte migration through the MEK/ERK signaling pathway. Gallic and chlorogenic acids in mulberry leaves (ML) powder-modulated TNF, IL-6, and IRS1 proteins, improving various inflammatory conditions by immune system modulation. As we delve deeper into understanding its anti-inflammatory potential and how it works therapeutically, it is crucial to refine the extraction process to enhance the effectiveness of its bioactive elements. Recent advancements in extraction techniques, such as solid-liquid extraction, pressurized liquid extraction, superficial fluid extraction, microwave-assisted extraction, and ultrasonic-assisted extraction, are being explored. Among the extraction methods tested, including Soxhlet extraction, maceration, and ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE), UAE demonstrated superior efficiency in extracting bioactive compounds from mulberry leaves. Overall, this comprehensive review sheds light on the potential of mulberry as a natural immunomodulatory agent and provides insights into its mechanisms of action for future research and therapeutic applications.
