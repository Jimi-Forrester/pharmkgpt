35044088|t|MST1-knockdown protects against impairment of working memory via regulating neural activity in depression-like mice.
35044088|a|We reported that over-expression of MST1 induced the impairment of spatial memory via disturbing neural oscillation patterns in mice. Meanwhile, the P-MST1 is increased in the hippocampus after chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS). However, it is unclear if MST1 knockdown protects against stress-induced memory deficits via modulating neural activities. In the study, a CUMS mouse model was established and an intrahippocampal injection of AAV-shMST1 was used to knockdown MST1 in the hippocampus. The data showed that there were memory deficits with over-expressed P-MST1 level in CUMS mice. However, MST1 knockdown can significantly prevent the damages of CUMS-induced working memory and synaptic plasticity via regulating neural oscillation patterns. It suggests that MST1 down-regulation effectively protected against stress-induced behavioral dysfunctions. Moreover, as a more convenient way, neural oscillation analysis could provide some assistance for the auxiliary diagnosis and treatment of depression.
