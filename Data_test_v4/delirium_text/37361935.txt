37361935|a|Background: Pneumonia infected by Chlamydia abortus (C. abortus) is rare, especially complicated with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). Case Presentation: We presented the clinical details of a 44-year-old male who was diagnosed with C. abortus pneumonia, which rapidly progressed and ultimately led to ARDS, sepsis and MODS. Although he was initially diagnosed with pneumonia upon admission, no pathogenic bacteria were detected in sputum by conventional tests. Empirical intravenous infusion of meropenem and moxifloxacin was administered, but unfortunately, his condition deteriorated rapidly, especially respiratory status. On Day 2 after extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) initiation, metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) was performed on the patient's bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, which indicated an infection with C. abortus. The patient's antimicrobial therapy was adjusted to oral doxycycline (0.1g every 12h), intravenous azithromycin (0.5g every day), and imipenem and cilastatin sodium (1g every 6h). The patient's condition improved clinically and biologically. However, the patient was discharged due to financial reasons and unfortunately passed away eight hours later. Conclusion: Infections with C. abortus can result in severe ARDS and serious visceral complications which necessitate prompt diagnosis and active intervention by clinicians. The case highlights the significance of mNGS as an essential diagnostic tool for uncommon pathogens. Tetracyclines, macrolides or their combinations are effective choices for treatment of C. abortus pneumonia. Further study is needed to explore the transmission routes of C. abortus pneumonia and establish precise guidelines for antibiotic treatment.
