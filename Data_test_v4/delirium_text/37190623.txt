37190623|t|High-Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein, Its Change, and Cognitive Function: A National Population-Based Cohort Study.
37190623|a|This study aimed to evaluate the associations of baseline high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (Hs-CRP) and its change with subsequent cognitive decline and cognitive impairment. Data for this study were obtained from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study, a national community-based prospective cohort study. Hs-CRP level and cognitive function were measured repeatedly over a 7-year follow-up. Linear mixed models and cox proportional hazard models were used to evaluate the associations. The study comprised 7385 participants (50.67% women, mean age 59.08 +- 8.86 years) with baseline Hs-CRP ranging from 0.03 to 178.10 mg/L (median: 1.01 mg/L, IQR: 0.55-2.11 mg/L). During a median of 5.79 years follow-up, the highest quartile of the Hs-CRP group showed a faster rate of cognitive decline (-0.0053 SD/year, p = 0.006) and a higher risk of cognitive impairment (HR 1.0814, p = 0.044) than those in the lowest quartile. Individuals in the elevated group of Hs-CRP change had a significantly faster cognitive decline (-0.0070 SD/year, p = 0.016) compared with those in the stable group. In this study, significant longitudinal associations between baseline Hs-CRP, elevated Hs-CRP, and long-term cognitive deterioration were observed. Hs-CRP level could perhaps serve as a predictor for cognitive deterioration in middle-aged and older adults.
