34754412|t|Pareidolia in Parkinson's Disease and Multiple System Atrophy.
34754412|a|Pareidolia is a visual illusion of meaningful objects that arise from ambiguous forms embedded in visual scenes. Previous studies showed that pareidolias are frequently observed in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) as well as dementia with Lewy bodies. However, whether pareidolias are useful for differentiating PD from other neurodegenerative parkinsonism disorders including multiple system atrophy (MSA) is unclear. The noise pareidolia test (NPT) was performed in 40 and 48 patients with PD and MSA, respectively. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to evaluate sensitivity and specificity. Results of neuropsychological tests were also compared between patients with PD with and without pareidolias. Visual hallucinations were present in none of the subjects. Pareidolic response in the NPT was observed in 47.5% and 18.8% of patients with PD and MSA, respectively. The number of pareidolic responses in patients with PD was significantly larger compared with patients with MSA (P=0.001). ROC curve analyses showed the sensitivity and specificity at 33% and 98%, respectively. Among patients with PD, those with pareidolias demonstrated higher State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-state (P=0.044) and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-trait (P=0.044) than those without pareidolias. Pareidolias can be found in patients with PD without visual hallucinations, and the pareidolia test may be a highly specific test for differentiating PD from MSA. Thus, anxiety may be associated with pareidolias in patients with PD.
