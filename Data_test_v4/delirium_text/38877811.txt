38877811|t|The Bispectral Electroencephalography Method Quantifies Postoperative Delirium-Like States in Young and Aged Male Mice After Head-Mount Implantation Surgery.
38877811|a|Delirium, a syndrome characterized by an acute change in attention, awareness, and cognition, is commonly observed in older adults, although there are few quantitative monitoring methods in the clinical setting. We developed a bispectral electroencephalography (BSEEG) method capable of detecting delirium and can quantify the severity of delirium using a novel algorithm. Preclinical application of this novel BSEEG method can capture a delirium-like state in mice following lipopolysaccharide administration. However, its application to postoperative delirium (POD) has not yet been validated in animal experiments. This study aimed to create a POD model in mice with the BSEEG method by monitoring BSEEG scores following EEG head-mount implantation surgery and throughout the recovery. We compared the BSEEG scores of C57BL/6J young (2-3 months old) with aged (18-19 months old) male mice for quantitative evaluation of POD-like states. Postoperatively, both groups displayed increased BSEEG scores and a loss of regular diurnal changes in BSEEG scores. In young mice, BSEEG scores and regular diurnal changes recovered relatively quickly to baseline by postoperative day (PO-Day) 3. Conversely, aged mice exhibited prolonged increases in postoperative BSEEG scores and it reached steady states only after PO-Day 8. This study suggests that the BSEEG method can be utilized as a quantitative measure of POD and assess the effect of aging on recovery from POD in the preclinical model.
