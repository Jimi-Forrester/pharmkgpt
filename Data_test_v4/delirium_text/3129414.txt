3129414|t|In vitro conditions for the self-polymerization of the microtubule-associated protein, tau factor.
3129414|a|One of the microtubule associated proteins, tau factor, that appears associated to the paired helical filaments of Alzheimer's disease presents, by itself, after urea treatment, the ability of polymerizing in vitro as tested by immunoelectronmicroscopy. These polymers resemble in their width and appearance those of the paired helical filaments. The conditions required for this assembly have been studied and determined the protein concentration needed, the influence of salt concentration and pH as well as the possible modifications (deamination, acylation) which may be implied in such in vitro polymerization.
