35459383|a|Thanks to advances in intensive care, number of patients discharged from intensive care units is increasing. Along with that, there is also growing interest in long-term outcomes monitoring. A large proportion of patients suffers from cognitive, psychiatric and physical disabilities after discharge from intensive care unit. A set of these disabilities is called Post-intensive care syndrome (PICS). Along with patients, also their relatives could be affected, especially by mental disorders (PICS-Family, PICS-F). Long term or permanent consequences can lead to the loss of self-sufficiency, reduced quality of life, frequent rehospitalizations and numerous other health and economical consequences. A set of preventive procedures, applied during ICU hospitalization, is essential in preventing the development of PICS. In particular, prevention of extensive sedation, delirium management and early mobilization and thorough rehabilitation is needed. A much discussed topic is further outpatient monitoring of discharged patients in various post-intensive care facilities.
