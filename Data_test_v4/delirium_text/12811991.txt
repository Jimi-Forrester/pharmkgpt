12811991|a|At a time when they are losing skills in virtually all arenas of life, persons with Alzheimer's disease can experience significant, esteem-building achievements in physical fitness and mood through supervised participation in an exercise program. The effects of physical exercise plus cognitive and social stimulation on persons with early stage Alzheimer's disease were assessed in a longitudinal study. Twenty-four such individuals, aged 54 to 88 at program entry, participated in 16 to 20 exercise sessions and 10 community activity sessions per semester for two to eight semesters. Half of the weekly exercise sessions included memory and language stimulation activities. Students, supplemented by family caregivers, supervised the sessions. Exercise sessions consisted of flexibility, balance, aerobic, and weight resistance activities. Preparticipation and semiannual post-testing of aerobic fitness and duration and upper and lower body strength was done. Highly significant fitness gains (p < .001) were achieved in the six-minute walk test, upper and lower body strength, and duration of aerobic exercise. Five participants, aged 86 to 91, completed six to eight semesters and were doing 27 to 45 minutes of aerobics per session at program's end. Five participants scored within the normal range for age-matched healthy active adults on the six-minute walk test at baseline. Nine others achieved and three exceeded the normal range during treatment. Cognitive decline was slowed and mood improved. First-year cognitive outcomes have been published elsewhere. An article reporting final cognitive outcomes is in preparation; Outcome data is summarized on the project website: www.u.arizona.edu/ ~sarkin/elderrehab.html. The benefits of physical exercise can be made available at nominal cost to Alzheimer's patients and other elderly persons by using students to provide transportation, supervision, and the motivational support that is key to exercise adherence. Further research is needed to determine the relative contributions of each program component to the positive outcomes.
