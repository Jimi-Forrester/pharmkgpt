37384067|t|Perioperative Care of the Pediatric Patient and an Algorithm for the Treatment of Intraoperative Bronchospasm.
37384067|a|Asthma remains a common comorbid condition in patients presenting for anesthetic care. As a chronic inflammatory disease of the airway, asthma is known to increase the risk of intraoperative bronchospasm. As the incidence and severity of asthma and other chronic respiratory conditions that alter airway reactivity is increasing, a greater number of patients at risk for perioperative bronchospasm are presenting for anesthetic care. As bronchospasm remains one of the more common intraoperative adverse events, recognizing and mitigating preoperative risk factors and having a pre-determined treatment algorithm for acute events are essential to ensuring effective resolution of this intraoperative emergency. The following article reviews the perioperative care of pediatric patients with asthma, discusses modifiable risk factors for intraoperative bronchospasm, and outlines the differential diagnosis of intraoperative wheezing. Additionally, a treatment algorithm for intraoperative bronchospasm is suggested.
