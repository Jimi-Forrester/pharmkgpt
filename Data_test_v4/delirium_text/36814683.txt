36814683|t|New Insight Into Mechanisms of Hepatic Encephalopathy: An Integrative Analysis Approach to Identify Molecular Markers and Therapeutic Targets.
36814683|a|Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a set of complex neurological complications that arise from advanced liver disease. The precise molecular and cellular mechanism of HE is not fully understood. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from microarray technologies are powerful approaches to obtain new insight into the pathophysiology of HE. We analyzed microarray data sets of cirrhotic patients with HE from Gene Expression Omnibus to identify DEGs in postmortem cerebral tissues. Consequently, we uploaded significant DEGs into the STRING to specify protein-protein interactions. Cytoscape was used to reconstruct the genetic network and identify hub genes. Target genes were uploaded to different databases to perform comprehensive enrichment analysis and repurpose new therapeutic options for HE. A total of 457 DEGs were identified in 2 data sets totally from 12 cirrhotic patients with HE compared with 12 healthy subjects. We found that 274 genes were upregulated and 183 genes were downregulated. Network analyses on significant DEGs indicated 12 hub genes associated with HE. Enrichment analysis identified fatty acid beta-oxidation, cerebral organic acidurias, and regulation of actin cytoskeleton as main involved pathways associated with upregulated genes; serotonin receptor 2 and ELK-SRF/GATA4 signaling, GPCRs, class A rhodopsin-like, and p38 MAPK signaling pathway were related to downregulated genes. Finally, we predicted 39 probable effective drugs/agents for HE. This study not only confirms main important involved mechanisms of HE but also reveals some yet unknown activated molecular and cellular pathways in human HE. In addition, new targets were identified that could be of value in the future study of HE.
