19748159|t|Progression from MCI to AD: predictive value of CSF Abeta42 is modified by APOE genotype.
19748159|a|OBJECTIVE: To study CSF biomarkers amyloid-beta 1-42 (Abeta42) and total tau (tau) in relation to APOE genotype in their ability to predict progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: In 100 MCI patients CSF Abeta42, tau and APOE genotype were determined. At follow-up of 18 (13-24) months 58 patients remained non-progressive and 42 progressed to AD. RESULTS: Cox proportional hazards models showed an interaction between Abeta42 and APOE genotype (p<0.05). Stratification for APOE revealed HR (95% CI) for abnormal Abeta42 of 8.2 (2.1-31.9) for epsilon4 non-carriers, 3.9 (0.8-18.5) for heterozygotes and 0.3 (0.0-1.7) for homozygotes. Inversely, stratification for Abeta42 revealed that in patients with normal levels of Abeta42, epsilon4 homozygotes had a strongly increased risk of progression to AD with HR (95% CI) 20.8 (2.4-182.8). Tau and APOE independently predicted progression to AD. CONCLUSIONS: Abeta42 was a stronger predictor of progression to AD in APOE epsilon4 non-carriers than in carriers. Furthermore, the risk of progression for epsilon4 homozygotes was very high, also in patients with normal levels of Abeta42.
