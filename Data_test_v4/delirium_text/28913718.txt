28913718|t|Identify a shared neural circuit linking multiple neuropsychiatric symptoms with Alzheimer's pathology.
28913718|a|Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are common in Alzheimer's disease (AD)-associated neurodegeneration. However, NPS lack a consistent relationship with AD pathology. It is unknown whether any common neural circuits can link these clinically disparate while mechanistically similar features with AD pathology. Here, we explored the neural circuits of NPS in AD-associated neurodegeneration using multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) of resting-state functional MRI data. Data from 98 subjects (70 amnestic mild cognitive impairment and 28 AD subjects) were obtained. The top 10 regions differentiating symptom presence across NPS were identified, which were mostly the fronto-limbic regions (medial prefrontal cortex, caudate, etc.). These 10 regions' functional connectivity classified symptomatic subjects across individual NPS at 69.46-81.27%, and predicted multiple NPS (indexed by Neuropsychiatric Symptom Questionnaire-Inventory) and AD pathology (indexed by baseline and change of beta-amyloid/pTau ratio) all above 70%. Our findings suggest a fronto-limbic dominated neural circuit that links multiple NPS and AD pathology. With further examination of the structural and pathological changes within the circuit, the circuit may shed light on linking behavioral disturbances with AD-associated neurodegeneration.
