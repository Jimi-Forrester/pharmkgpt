37181536|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia and the fifth leading cause of death in the adult population has a complex pathophysiological link with hypertension (HTN). A growing volume of published literature on a parallel elevation of blood pressure (BP), amyloid plaques, and neurofibrillary tangles formation in post-middle of human brain cells has developed new, widely accepting foundations on this association. In particular, HTN in elderly life mediates cerebral blood flow dysfunction, neuronal dysfunction, and significant decline in cognitive impairment, primarily in the late-life populace, governing the onset of AD. Thus, HTN is an established risk factor for AD. Considering the impact of AD, 1.89 million deaths annually, and the failure of palliative therapies to cure AD, the scientific research community is looking to adopt integrated approaches to target early modified risk factors like HTN to reduce AD burden. The current review highlights the significance and impact of HTN-based prevention in lowering the AD burden in the elderly by providing a comprehensive overview of the physiological relationship between AD and HTN with an in-detail explanation of the role and applications of pathological biomarkers in this clinical association. The review will gain worth in presenting new insights and providing inclusive discussion on the correlation between HTN and cognitive impairment. It will increase across a wider scientific audience to expand understanding of this pathophysiological association.
