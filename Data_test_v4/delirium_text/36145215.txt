36145215|t|A Comparative Study between the Three Waves of the Pandemic on the Prevalence of Oropharyngeal Dysphagia and Malnutrition among Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19.
36145215|a|BACKGROUND: The phenotype of patients affected by COVID-19 disease changed between the waves of the pandemic. We assessed the prevalence of oropharyngeal dysphagia (OD), malnutrition (MN), and mortality between the first three waves of COVID-19 patients in a general hospital. METHODS: a prospective observational study between April 2020-May 2021. Clinical assessment for OD was made with the volume-viscosity swallowing test; nutritional assessment was performed consistent with GLIM criteria. A multimodal intervention was implemented in the second and third wave, including (a) texturized diets-fork mashable (1900 kcal + 90 g protein) or pureed (1700 kcal + 75 g protein), (b) oral nutritional supplements (500-600 kcal + 25-30 g protein), and (c) fluid thickening (250 mPa s or 800 mPa s). RESULTS: We included 205 patients (69.3 +- 17.6 years) in the 1st, 200 (66.4 +- 17.5 years) in the 2nd, and 200 (72.0 +- 16.3 years;) in the 3rd wave (p = 0.004). On admission, prevalence of OD was 51.7%, 31.3% and 35.1%, and MN, 45.9%, 36.8% and 34.7%, respectively; mortality was 10.7%, 13.6% and 19.1%. OD was independently associated with age, delirium, and MN; MN, with age, OD, diarrhea and ICU admission; mortality, with age, OD and MN. (4) Conclusions: Prevalence of OD, MN and mortality was very high among COVID-19 patients. OD was independently associated with MN and mortality. An early and proactive multimodal nutritional intervention improved patients' nutritional status.
