30456288|a|INTRODUCTION: Little empirical work has been done to examine differences between mild cognitive impairment (MCI) diagnosed in research settings with longitudinal data (incident MCI) and MCI diagnosed in clinical settings (prevalent MCI). Because Alzheimer's disease progresses over a clinicopathological continuum, we examined the cognitive differences between these two different sources of MCI patients. METHODS: We compared 52 consecutively identified patients with prevalent amnestic MCI with 53 incident amnestic MCI participants from the Arizona APOE study. Neuropsychological data from common tests were compared encompassing four cognitive domains and one global indicator. RESULTS: Prevalent MCI cases performed significantly worse than incident MCI cases on global as well as domain-specific measures. DISCUSSION: By the time patients seek evaluation for memory loss, they have more severe single domain, amnestic MCI than research subjects with incident MCI. Studies of MCI should distinguish incident and prevalent not just single- and multiple-domain MCI.
