36240738|a|Although women are at higher risk for Alzheimer's disease and other tauopathies, the underlying mechanisms are unclear. In this issue of Cell, Yan et al. show that aberrantly high activity of X-linked USP11 deubiquitinase in women impairs clearance of tau, the principal component of neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer's disease.
