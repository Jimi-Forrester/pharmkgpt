36140994|t|Determination of Maximum Oil Yield, Quality Indicators and Absorbance Spectra of Hulled Sunflower Seeds Oil Extraction under Axial Loading.
36140994|a|The present study aims to estimate the maximum oil yield of hulled sunflower seed samples in a uniaxial process under a load of 40 kN and speed of 4 mm/min. The oil samples were assessed for their quality parameters and spectra curves within the wavelength range of 325-600 nm. The results show that heating temperatures in the range of 40  C to 80  C increased the oil output; however, a maximum oil yield of 48.869 +- 6.023% with a minimum energy of 533.709 +- 65.644 J at the fifth repeated pressing was obtained from the unheated sample compared to the heated samples. The peroxide values ranged from 6.898 +- 0.144 to 7.290 +- 0.507 meq O2/kg, acid values from 1.043 +- 0.166 to 1.998 +- 0.276 mg KOH/g oil and free fatty acid values from 0.521 +- 0.083 to 0.999 +- 0.138 mg KOH/g oil, which were within the recommended quality threshold. There were significant spectral differences among the oil samples. A single absorbance peak was observed at 350 nm for all oil samples, indicating low levels of pigment molecules in the oil. The study revealed the need for repeated pressings to recover the considerable residual oil remaining in the seedcake after the first pressing.
