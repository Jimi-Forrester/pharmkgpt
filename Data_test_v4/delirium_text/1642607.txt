1642607|t|General practitioners' reported knowledge about depression and dementia in elderly patients.
1642607|a|Previous studies have shown that general practitioners often fail to detect dementia and depression in their elderly patients. The present study aimed to find out how much knowledge general practitioners have of these disorders. The knowledge of 36 general practitioners was assessed and it was found that they had a limited knowledge of the symptoms and signs of dementia and depression. Furthermore, almost 60% of the general practitioners did not know that Alzheimer's disease is the most common dementing disorder.
