36499174|t|Complete and Prolonged Inhibition of Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1 Infection In Vitro by CRISPR/Cas9 and CRISPR/CasX Systems.
36499174|a|Almost all people become infected with herpes viruses, including herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), during their lifetime. Typically, these viruses persist in a latent form that is resistant to all available antiviral medications. Under certain conditions, such as immunosuppression, the latent forms reactivate and cause disease. Moreover, strains of herpesviruses that are drug-resistant have rapidly emerged. Therefore, it is important to develop alternative methods capable of eradicating herpesvirus infections. One promising direction is the development of CRISPR/Cas systems for the therapy of herpesvirus infections. We aimed to design a CRISPR/Cas system for relatively effective long-term and safe control of HSV-1 infection. Here, we show that plasmids encoding the CRISPR/Cas9 system from Streptococcus pyogenes with a single sgRNA targeting the UL30 gene can completely suppress HSV-1 infection of the Vero cell line within 6 days and provide substantial protection within 9 days. For the first time, we show that CRISPR/CasX from Deltaproteobacteria with a single guide RNA against UL30 almost completely suppresses HSV-1 infection of the Vero cell line for 3 days and provides substantial protection for 6 days. We also found that the Cas9 protein without sgRNAs attenuates HSV-1 infection. Our results show that the developed CRISPR/Cas systems are promising therapeutic approaches to control HSV-1 infections.
