30893872|t|Structure Based Design and Molecular Docking Studies for Phosphorylated Tau Inhibitors in Alzheimer's Disease.
30893872|a|The purpose of our study is to identify phosphorylated tau (p-tau) inhibitors. P-tau has recently received great interest as a potential drug target in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The continuous failure of Abeta-targeted therapeutics recommends an alternative drug target to treat AD. There is increasing evidence and growing awareness of tau, which plays a central role in AD pathophysiology, including tangles formation, abnormal activation of phosphatases/kinases, leading p-tau aggregation in AD neurons. In the present study, we performed computational pharmacophore models, molecular docking, and simulation studies for p-tau in order to identify hyperphosphorylated sites. We found multiple serine sites that altered the R1/R2 repeats flanking sequences in the tau protein, affecting the microtubule binding ability of tau. The ligand molecules exhibited the p-O ester scaffolds with inhibitory and/or blocking actions against serine residues of p-tau. Our molecular docking results revealed five ligands that showed high docking scores and optimal protein-ligand interactions of p-tau. These five ligands showed the best pharmacokinetic and physicochemical properties, including good absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) and admetSAR toxicity tests. The p-tau pharmacophore based drug discovery models provide the comprehensive and rapid drug interventions in AD, and tauopathies are expected to be the prospective future therapeutic approach in AD.
