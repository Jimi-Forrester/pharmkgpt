34944470|t|Inflammatory Biomarkers in Addictive Disorders.
34944470|a|Substance use disorders are a group of diseases that are associated with social, professional, and family impairment and that represent a high socio-economic impact on the health systems of countries around the world. These disorders present a very complex diagnosis and treatment regimen due to the lack of suitable biomarkers supporting the correct diagnosis and classification and the difficulty of selecting effective therapies. Over the last few years, several studies have pointed out that these addictive disorders are associated with systemic and central nervous system inflammation, which could play a relevant role in the onset and progression of these diseases. Therefore, identifying different immune system components as biomarkers of such addictive disorders could be a crucial step to promote appropriate diagnosis and treatment. Thus, this work aims to provide an overview of the immune system alterations that may be biomarkers of various addictive disorders.
