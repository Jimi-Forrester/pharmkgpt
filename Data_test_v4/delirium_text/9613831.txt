9613831|a|Until now 'c-series' polysialogangliosides were known to exist in human brain only during development and in some pathological conditions like Alzheimer's disease. Using thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and immunostaining with Q211 antibody (TLC-overlay technique) we have analysed 'c-series' gangliosides in four human cerebella (age 20, 47, 52 and 54 years). Four distinct ganglioside bands, most probably corresponding to GT1c, GQ1c, GP1c and GH1c were found to exist in the analysed brains, which is convincing demonstration of the existence of 'c-series' gangliosides in normal adult human brain. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed to locate polysialogangliosides in the analysed tissue. Q211 antibody was found to bind specifically to a single subpopulation of neurons in the molecular layer of adult cerebellum. According to their position and morphology these cells correspond to stellate neurons.
