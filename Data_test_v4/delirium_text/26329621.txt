26329621|t|[Assessment of Feasibility of Early Ambulation and Food-intake on the Operative Day after Lung Resection].
26329621|a|To decrease the risk of morbidity, we have started an early ambulation and food-intake program conducted on the same day as pulmonary resection. This protocol was developed with consideration of the characteristics of lung surgery and conducted through an interdisciplinary team-approach. The assessment of feasibility and clinical effectiveness of this protocol was evaluated in 64 consecutive patients. No apparent adverse effect relating to this protocol was recorded. Fifty-five of 64 patients( 80%) were able to accomplish ambulation to the up-right standing position. Thirty-four of 64 patients( 53%) were able to consume more than half the amount of their hospital supper. No patients, including 5 patients who had had a past-history of postoperative delirium after their previous surgery, developed postoperative delirium after conducting this protocol. This protocol, which consisted of extraordinary early ambulation and food-intake on the operative day, was done safely and is expected to have some benefit as a postoperative management protocol for lung surgery.
