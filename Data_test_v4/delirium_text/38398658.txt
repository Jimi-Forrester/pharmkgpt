38398658|a|Dendrobium nobile is a traditional Chinese herb with anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and neuroprotective properties. However, its antiaging effects are unclear. Herein, we studied the aging-related functions and the mechanism of action of the alcohol extract of Dendrobium nobile (DnAE) in the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans. The results indicated that 1 mg/mL DnAE slowed lipofuscin accumulation, decreased the levels of reactive oxygen species, elevated superoxide dismutase activity, enhanced oxidative and heat stress resistance, extended the lifespan of nematodes, protected their dopamine neurons from 6-hydroxydopamine-induced neurodegeneration, and reduced Abeta-induced neurotoxicity. DnAE upregulated the mRNA expression of the transcription factors DAF-16 and HSF-1, promoted the nuclear localization of DAF-16, and enhanced the fluorescence intensity of HSP-16.2. However, it had no effect on the lifespan of DAF-16 mutants. Thus, DnAE can significantly extend lifespan, enhance heat stress tolerance, and delay age-related diseases through a DAF-16-dependent pathway.
