39588176|t|A Review of Datasets, Optimization Strategies, and Learning Algorithms for Analyzing Alzheimer's Dementia Detection.
39588176|a|Alzheimer's Dementia (AD) is a progressive neurological disorder that affects memory and cognitive function, necessitating early detection for its effective management. This poses a significant challenge to global public health. The early and accurate detection of dementia is crucial for several reasons. First, timely detection facilitates early intervention and planning of treatment. Second, precise diagnostic methods are essential for distinguishing dementia from other cognitive disorders and medical conditions that may present with similar symptoms. Continuous analysis and improvements in detection methods have contributed to advancements in medical research. It helps to identify new biomarkers, refine existing diagnostic tools, and foster the development of innovative technologies, ultimately leading to more accurate and efficient diagnostic approaches for dementia. This paper presents a critical analysis of multimodal imaging datasets, learning algorithms, and optimisation techniques utilised in the context of Alzheimer's dementia detection. The focus is on understanding the advancements and challenges in employing diverse imaging modalities, such as MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging), PET (Positron Emission Tomography), and EEG (ElectroEncephaloGram). This study evaluated various machine learning algorithms, deep learning models, transfer learning techniques, and generative adversarial networks for the effective analysis of multi-modality imaging data for dementia detection. In addition, a critical examination of optimisation techniques encompassing optimisation algorithms and hyperparameter tuning strategies for processing and analysing images is presented in this study to discern their influence on model performance and generalisation. Thorough examination and enhancement of methods for dementia detection are fundamental for addressing the healthcare challenges posed by dementia, facilitating timely interventions, improving diagnostic accuracy, and advancing research in neurodegenerative diseases.
