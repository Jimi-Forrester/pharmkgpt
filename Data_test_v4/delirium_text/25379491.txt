25379491|a|OBJECTIVE: To determine whether cognitive function is associated with white matter hyperintensities (WMH) in patients with infratentorial stroke. METHODS: This was a retrospective, cross-sectional study. Twenty-four first-ever infratentorial stroke patients between 18 and 60 years of age were enrolled. WMH was evaluated by the Fazekas scale and the Scheltens scale. Cognitive functions were assessed using the Korean Mini-Mental Status Examination (K-MMSE), Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test, and the Seoul Computerized Neuropsychological Test Battery (SCNT) at one month after stroke. All participants were divided into two groups based on the presence of WMH (no-WMH group and WMH group). General characteristics and cognitive functions were compared between the groups. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in general characteristics, such as age, stroke type, hypertension history, and education level between the two groups. However, K-MMSE in the WMH group was significantly lower compared to the no-WMH group (p<0.05). The verbal learning test score in SCNT was significantly higher in the no-WMH group compared to the WMH group (p<0.05). Executive function in the no-WMH group tended to be higher compared to the WMH group. CONCLUSION: Impairment of cognitive function in patients with infratentorial stroke appeared to be associated with WMH. WMH should be carefully evaluated during rehabilitation of infratentorial stroke patients.
