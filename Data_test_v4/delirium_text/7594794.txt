7594794|t|[A case of gas-containing liver abscess with multiple metastatic lesions].
7594794|a|A 63-year-old male was admitted to our hospital because of high fever and delirium. He had been diagnosed as diabetes mellitus five years before but not treated at all. An abdominal CT scan showed gas-containing abscess in the right lobe of the liver. Klebsiella pneumoniae and Bacteroides distasonis were cultured both from the punctured specimen of the abscess and from arterial blood. Catheter drainage was carried out percutaneously under guidance with ultrasonography and antibiotics was administered intravenously. He was diagnosed as purulent meningitis by lumbar puncture on admission and as endophthalmitis because of swelling of the left eyeball on hospital day 4. CT scan also showed multiple metastatic lesions in the cerebrum and in the lung. After three months, he was discharged from the hospital in good condition, except for loss of vision of the left eye.
