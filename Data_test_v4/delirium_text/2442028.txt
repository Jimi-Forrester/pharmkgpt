2442028|a|Reactivity to antibodies directed against phosphorylated neurofilament epitopes is normally present in axons. Phosphorylated neurofilament immunoreactivity is not generally found in neuronal perikarya, except in abnormal states such as Alzheimer's disease. We found that cytoplasm of neurons of the nucleus tractus mesencephalici nervi trigemini in normal mice and rats reacts with monoclonal antibodies against phosphorylated epitopes on neurofilaments. This suggests either that phosphorylated epitopes on neurofilaments are localized in the perikarya of some normal neurons or that the antibodies that were used (SMI 31 and SMI 34) recognize more than phosphorylated epitopes.
