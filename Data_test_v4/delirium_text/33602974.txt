33602974|a|Precocious puberty (PP) is an important endocrine disorder affecting children globally. Several genes, SNPs and comorbidities are reported to be associated with PP; however, this data is scattered across scientific literature and has not been systematically collated and analysed. In this study, we present PrecocityDB as the first manually curated online database on genes and their ontology terms, SNPs, and pathways associated with PP. A tool for visualizing SNP coordinates and allelic variation on each chromosome, for genes associated with PP is also incorporated in PrecocityDB. Pathway enrichment analysis of PP-associated genes revealed that endocrine and cancer-related pathways are highly enriched. Disease enrichment analysis indicated that individuals with PP seem to be highly likely to suffer from reproductive and metabolic disorders such as PCOS, hypogonadism, and insulin resistance. PrecocityDB is a useful resource for identification of comorbid conditions and disease risks due to shared genes in PP. PrecocityDB is freely accessible at http://www.precocity.bicnirrh.res.in . The database source code and content can be downloaded through GitHub ( https://github.com/bic-nirrh/precocity ).
