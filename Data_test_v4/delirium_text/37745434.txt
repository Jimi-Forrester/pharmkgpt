37745434|t|Global brain activity and its coupling with cerebrospinal fluid flow is related to tau pathology.
37745434|a|Amyloid-beta (Abeta) and tau deposition constitute Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathology. Cortical tau deposits first in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus and then propagates to neocortex in an Abeta-dependent manner. Tau also tends to accumulate earlier in higher-order association cortex than in lower-order primary sensory-motor cortex. While previous research has examined the production and spread of tau, little attention has been paid to its clearance. Low-frequency (<0.1 Hz) global brain activity during the resting state is coupled with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow and potentially reflects glymphatic clearance. Here we report that tau deposition in subjects with evaluated Abeta, accompanied by cortical thinning and cognitive decline, is strongly associated with decreased coupling between CSF flow and global brain activity. Substantial modulation of global brain activity is also manifested as propagating waves of brain activation between higher- and lower-order regions, resembling tau spreading. Together, the findings suggest an important role of resting-state global brain activity in AD tau pathology. One Sentence Summary: Resting-state global brain activity affects tau deposition through the potential involvement of a glymphatic clearance function.
