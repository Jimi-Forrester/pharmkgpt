37976553|a|Caregivers of people living with dementia are pillars of the care community. Providing them with adequate support throughout their caregiving journey is essential to their quality of life and may also contribute to improving the care of people living with dementia. Nav-CARE (Navigation - Connecting, Advocating, Resourcing, Engaging) is a volunteer-led navigation program that provides support to older adults with life-limiting illnesses who are living in the community. However, Nav-CARE does not provide support directly to caregivers of people living with dementia. To adapt Nav-CARE to support caregivers, we needed to establish caregivers' needs and the competencies volunteer navigators should be trained in to support caregivers to meet these needs. To do so, a modified e-Delphi method was utilized, which consisted of administering three sequential questionnaires to a panel of 35 individuals with expertise in a variety of dementia related domains. Through this, two final lists of 46 caregivers' needs and 41 volunteer competencies were established to inform the development of volunteer navigator training curriculum. Findings suggest that trained volunteer navigators may be able to support caregivers of people living with dementia throughout the disease trajectory and can be used to inform the development of future dementia navigation programs.
