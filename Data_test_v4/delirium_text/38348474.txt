38348474|t|Structure of Amyloid Peptide Ribbons Characterized by Electron Microscopy, Atomic Force Microscopy, and Solid-State Nuclear Magnetic Resonance.
38348474|a|Polypeptides often self-assemble to form amyloid fibrils, which contain cross-beta structural motifs and are typically 5-15 nm in width and micrometers in length. In many cases, short segments of longer amyloid-forming protein or peptide sequences also form cross-beta assemblies but with distinctive ribbon-like morphologies that are characterized by a well-defined thickness (on the order of 5 nm) in one lateral dimension and a variable width (typically 10-100 nm) in the other. Here, we use a novel combination of data from solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR), dark-field transmission electron microscopy (TEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and cryogenic electron microscopy (cryoEM) to investigate the structures within amyloid ribbons formed by residues 14-23 and residues 11-25 of the Alzheimer's disease-associated amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta14-23 and Abeta11-25). The ssNMR data indicate antiparallel beta-sheets with specific registries of intermolecular hydrogen bonds. Mass-per-area values are derived from dark-field TEM data. The ribbon thickness is determined from AFM images. For Abeta14-23 ribbons, averaged cryoEM images show a periodic spacing of beta-sheets. The combined data support structures in which the amyloid ribbon growth direction is the direction of intermolecular hydrogen bonds between beta-strands, the ribbon thickness corresponds to the width of one beta-sheet (i.e., approximately the length of one molecule), and the variable ribbon width is a variable multiple of the thickness of one beta-sheet (i.e., a multiple of the repeat distance in a stack of beta-sheets). This architecture for a cross-beta assembly may generally exist within amyloid ribbons.
