33333795|t|Characterisation of Drug Delivery Efficacy Using Microstructure-Assisted Application of a Range of APIs.
33333795|a|Polymer-based solid microstructures (MSts) have the potential to significantly increase the quantity and range of drugs that can be administered across the skin. MSt arrays are used to demonstrate their capacity to bypass the skin barrier and enhance permeability by creating microchannels through the stratum corneum, in a minimally invasive manner. This study is designed to demonstrate the ability of MSts to exceed the current boundaries for transdermal delivery of compounds with different molecular weights, partition coefficients, acid dissociation constants, melting points, and water solubilities. In vitro permeation of a range of selected molecules, including acetyl salicylic acid (aspirin), galantamine, selegiline hydrochloride (Sel-HCl), insulin, caffeine, hydrocortisone (HC), hydrocortisone 21-hemisuccinate sodium salt (HC-HS) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) has been studied across excised porcine skin with and without poke and patch application of MSts. Permeation of the molecules was monitored using Franz diffusion cells over 24 h. MSts significantly increased the permeation of all selected molecules up to 40 times, compared to topical applications of the molecules without MSts. The greatest increase in permeation was observed for caffeine with 70 +- 8% permeation and the lowest enhancement was observed for HC with a 2.4 +- 1.3% increase in permeation. The highest obtained flux was BSA (8133 +- 1365 mug/cm2/h) and the lowest flux observed for HC (11 +- 4 mug/cm2/h). BSA and HC also showed the highest (16,275 +- 3078 mug) and the lowest (73 +- 47 mug) permeation amount after 24 h respectively. MSt-treated skin exhibits greatly increased permeation. The molecule parameters (size, acid dissociation constant, partition coefficient and solubility)-traditional hurdles associated with passive diffusion through intact skin-are overcome using MSt skin treatment.
