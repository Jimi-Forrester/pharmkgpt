37034594|t|Circadian disturbances and frailty risk in older adults: a prospective cohort study.
37034594|a|Frailty is characterized by diminished resilience to stressor events. It associates with adverse future health outcomes and impedes healthy aging. The circadian system orchestrates a ~24-h rhythm in bodily functions in synchrony with the day-night cycle, and disturbed circadian regulation plays an important role in many age-related health consequences. We investigated prospective associations of circadian disturbances with incident frailty in over 1,000 older adults who had been followed annually for up to 16 years. We found that decreased rhythm strength, reduced stability, or increased variation, were associated with a higher risk of incident frailty, and faster worsening of the overall frailty symptoms over time. Perturbed circadian rest-activity rhythms may be an early sign or risk factor for frailty in older adults.
