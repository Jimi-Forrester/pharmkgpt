38112925|t|Lithium prescription trends in psychiatric inpatient care 2014 to 2021: data from a Bavarian drug surveillance project.
38112925|a|OBJECTIVES: Lithium (Li) remains one of the most valuable treatment options for mood disorders. However, current knowledge about prescription practices in Germany is limited. The objective of this study is to estimate the prevalence of current Li use over time and in selected diagnoses, highlighting clinically relevant aspects such as prescription rates in elderly patients, concomitant medications, important drug-drug interactions, and serious adverse events. METHODS: We conducted a descriptive analysis of Li prescriptions, analyzing data from the ongoing Bavarian multicenter drug safety project Pharmaco-Epidemiology and Vigilance (Pharmako-EpiVig) from the years 2014-2021. Our study included 97,422 inpatients, 4543 of whom were prescribed Li. RESULTS: The Li prescription rate in unipolar depression (UD) remained constant at 4.6% over the observational period. In bipolar disorder (BD), the prescription rate increased significantly from 28.8% in 2014 to 34.4% in 2019. Furthermore, 30.3% of patients with Li prescriptions did not have a diagnosis of BD or UD, and 15.3% of patients with schizoaffective disorder were prescribed Li. The majority (64%) of patients with Li prescriptions were prescribed five or more drugs. Most of the 178 high-priority drug-drug interactions were due to hydrochlorothiazide (N = 157) followed by olmesartan (N = 16). CONCLUSION: Our study does not substantiate concerns about a decline in Li prescription. The decline in prescription rates observed in some diagnostic groups in 2020 and 2021 may be associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. The symptom-oriented use of Li beyond BD and UD is common. Polypharmacy and drug-drug interactions present a challenge in Li therapy. Old age and comorbid substance use disorder do not appear to be major deterrents for clinicians to initiate Li therapy.
