33515559|t|A review on advances of treatment modalities for Alzheimer's disease.
33515559|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifactorial neurodegenerative disease which is mainly characterized by progressive impairment in cognition, emotion, language and memory in older population. Considering the impact of AD, formulations of pharmaceutical drugs and cholinesterase inhibitors have been widely propagated, receiving endorsement by FDA as a form of AD treatment. However, these medications were gradually discovered to be ineffective in removing the root of AD pathogenesis but merely targeting the symptoms so as to improve a patient's cognitive outcome. Hence, a search for better disease-modifying alternatives is put into motion. Having a clear understanding of the neuroprotective mechanisms and diverse properties undertaken by specific genes, antibodies and nanoparticles is central towards designing novel therapeutic agents. In this review, we provide a brief introduction on the background of Alzheimer's disease, the biology of blood-brain barrier, along with the potentials and drawbacks associated with current therapeutic treatment avenues pertaining to gene therapy, immunotherapy and nanotherapy for better diagnosis and management of Alzheimer's disease.
