20110220|t|Morvan syndrome following B-cell lymphoma.
20110220|a|Morvan syndrome is a rare autoimmune disease named after the French physician Augustin Marie Morvan. It is characterized by multiple, irregular contractions of the long muscles, weakness, pruritus, hyperhidrosis, insomnia, and delirium. Here, we describe a 17-year-old young man, previously diagnosed with B-cell lymphoma, who presented with multiple asynchronous fasciculations of the long muscles of his lower extremities accompanied by numbness. The patient responded initially to pulse corticosteroids with diminution of the fasciculations. He achieved complete remission following 7 consecutive, monthly intravenous immunoglobulin injections. The present case is described in the context of the available literature.
