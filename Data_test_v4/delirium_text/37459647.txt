37459647|a|Alzheimer's is one of the most common neurodegenerative illnesses that affect brain cellular function. In this disease, the neurons in the brain are considered to be decaying steadily but consistently by the accumulation of amyloid mass, particularly the beta-amyloids, amyloid proteins, and Tau proteins. The most responsible amyloid-proteins are amyloid-40 and amyloid-42, which have a high probability of accumulating in excess over the brain cell, interfering with normal brain cell function and triggering brain cell death. The advancement of pharmaceutical sciences leads to the development of Nanotheranostics technology, which may be used to diagnose and treat Alzheimer's. They are the colloidal nanoparticles functionalised with the therapeutic moiety as well as a diagnostic moiety. This article discusses the prognosis of Alzheimer's, various nanotheranostics approaches (nanoparticles, quantum dots, aptamers, dendrimers, etc), and their recent advancement in managing Alzheimer's. Also, various in-vitro and in-vivo diagnostic methodologies were discussed with respect to nanotheranostics.
