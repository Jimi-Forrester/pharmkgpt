22150361|t|A case of semantic variant primary progressive aphasia with severe insular atrophy.
22150361|a|Insular degeneration has been linked to symptoms of frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Presented in this case is a patient exhibiting semantic variant primary progressive aphasia, behavioral disturbance. Upon autopsy, he was found to have severe insular atrophy. In addition, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors were ineffective in reducing symptoms of obsessive-compulsive behaviors or emotional blunting. This case suggests that  Seeley et al.'s (2007 , Alzheimer Disease & Associated Disorders, 21, S50) hypothesis that von Economo neurons and fork cell-rich brain regions, particularly in the insula, are targeted in additional subtypes of FTD beyond the behavioral variant.
