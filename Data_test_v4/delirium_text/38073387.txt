38073387|t|Delirium Prevention in Early Rehabilitation During Acute Hospitalization and Implementation of Programs Specifically Tailored to Older Patients with Cognitive Impairment: A Scoping Review with Meta-Analysis.
38073387|a|BACKGROUND: No systematic review on delirium prevention within early, hospital-based rehabilitation on implementation of approaches specifically tailored for patients with cognitive impairment (PwCI), such as Alzheimer's disease or vascular dementia, has been published despite the high relevance of specific medical care in this vulnerable population. OBJECTIVE: To document design and effectiveness of delirium prevention programs by early rehabilitation during acute, hospital-based medical care and implementation of programs specifically tailored to PwCI. METHODS: In a three-step approach, we first identified published systematic reviews of hospital-based, early rehabilitation interventions for older persons (>65 years) in relevant databases. In a second step, we screened each single trial of included reviews according to predefined inclusion criteria. In a third step, we analyzed studies with focus on delirium prevention. RESULTS: Among n = 25 studies identified, almost all intervention programs did not specifically target cognitive impairment (CI). Interventions were heterogeneous (modules: n = 2-19); almost all study samples were mixed/unspecified for cognitive status with more affected patients excluded. Only one study exclusively included delirium patients, and only one included CI patients. Results of random effect meta-analysis showed significant effects of generic programs to reduce delirium incidence during hospitalization by 41% (p < 0.001, odds ratio, 95% confidence interval: 0.59 [0.49, 0.71] with modest heterogeneity (I2: 30%). CONCLUSIONS: Study results document a lack of implementation for delirium prevention programs specifically tailored to PwCI by early, hospital-based rehabilitation. Specifying existing rehab concepts or augmenting them by CI-specific modules may help to develop, optimize, and implement innovative delirium prevention in PwCI in acute medical care.
