37983528|t|The role of myelin in neurodegeneration: implications for drug targets and neuroprotection strategies.
37983528|a|Myelination of axons in the central nervous system offers numerous advantages, including decreased energy expenditure for signal transmission and enhanced signal speed. The myelin sheaths surrounding an axon consist of a multi-layered membrane that is formed by oligodendrocytes, while specific glycoproteins and lipids play various roles in this formation process. As beneficial as myelin can be, its dysregulation and degeneration can prove detrimental. Inflammation, oxidative stress, and changes in cellular metabolism and the extracellular matrix can lead to demyelination of these axons. These factors are hallmark characteristics of certain demyelinating diseases including multiple sclerosis. The effects of demyelination are also implicated in primary degeneration in diseases such as glaucoma and Alzheimer's disease, as well as in processes of secondary degeneration. This reveals a relationship between myelin and secondary processes of neurodegeneration, including resultant degeneration following traumatic injury and transsynaptic degeneration. The role of myelin in primary and secondary degeneration is also of interest in the exploration of strategies and targets for remyelination, including the use of anti-inflammatory molecules or nanoparticles to deliver drugs. Although the use of these methods in animal models of diseases have shown to be effective in promoting remyelination, very few clinical trials in patients have met primary end points. This may be due to shortcomings or considerations that are not met while designing a clinical trial that targets remyelination. Potential solutions include diversifying disease targets and requiring concomitant interventions to promote rehabilitation.
