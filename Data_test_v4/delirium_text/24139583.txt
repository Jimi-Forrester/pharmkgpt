24139583|t|Discovery of 2-methylpyridine-based biaryl amides as gamma-secretase modulators for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
24139583|a|gamma-Secretase modulators (GSMs) are potentially disease-modifying treatments for Alzheimer's disease. They selectively lower pathogenic Abeta42 levels by shifting the enzyme cleavage sites without inhibiting gamma-secretase activity, possibly avoiding known adverse effects observed with complete inhibition of the enzyme complex. A cell-based HTS effort identified the sulfonamide 1 as a GSM lead. Lead optimization studies identified compound 25 with improved cell potency, PKDM properties, and it lowered Abeta42 levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of Sprague-Dawley rats following oral administration. Further optimization of 25 to improve cellular potency is described.
