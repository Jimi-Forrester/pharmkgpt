39125262|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative process responsible for almost 70% of all cases of dementia. The clinical signs consist in progressive and irreversible loss of memory, cognitive, and behavioral functions. The main histopathological hallmark is the accumulation of amyloid-ss (Ass) peptide fibrils in the brain. To date, the origin of Ass has not been determined. Recent studies have shown that the gut microbiota produces Ass, and dysbiotic states have been identified in AD patients and animal models of AD. Starting from the hypothesis that maintaining or restoring the microbiota's eubiosis is essential to control Ass's production and deposition in the brain, we used a mixture of probiotics and prebiotics (symbiotic) to treat APPPS1 male and female mice, an animal model of AD, from 2 to 8 months of age and evaluated their cognitive performances, mucus secretion, Abeta serum concentration, and microbiota composition. The results showed that the treatment was able to prevent the memory deficits, the reduced mucus secretion, the increased Abeta blood levels, and the imbalance in the gut microbiota found in APPPS1 mice. The present study demonstrates that the gut-brain axis plays a critical role in the genesis of cognitive impairment, and that modulation of the gut microbiota can ameliorate AD's symptomatology.
