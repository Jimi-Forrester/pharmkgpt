37304245|a|Calcium signaling is decisive for cellular functions. This calcium random walk stipulates neuronal functions. Calcium concentration could provoke gene transcription, apoptosis, neuronal plasticity, etc. A malformation in calcium could change the neuron's intracellular behavior. Calcium concentration balancing is a complex cellular mechanism. This occurrence can be handled with the Caputo fractional reaction-diffusion equation. In this mathematical modeling, we have included the STIM-Orai mechanism and Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) flux, Inositol Triphosphate Receptor (IPR), SERCA, plasma membrane flux, voltage-gated calcium entry, and different buffer interactions. A hybrid integral transform and Green's function approach were taken to solve the initial boundary problem. A closed-form solution of a Mittag-Leffler family function plotted using MATLAB software. Different parameters impact changes in the spatiotemporal behavior of the calcium concentration. Specific roles of organelles involved in Alzheimer's disease-affected neurons are computed. Ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid (EGTA), 1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane N,N,N,N-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA), and S100B protein effects are also observed. In all simulations, we can say S100B and the STIM-Orai effect cannot be neglected. This model lights up the different approaches for calcium signaling pathway simulation. As a consequence, we determine that a generalized reaction-diffusion approach is a better fit realistic model.
