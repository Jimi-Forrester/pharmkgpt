26074330|t|Schisandrin C Ameliorates Learning and Memory Deficits by Abeta1-42 -induced Oxidative Stress and Neurotoxicity in Mice.
26074330|a|Schisandrin C (SCH-C) is a main and typical antioxidative lignan isolated from the fruits of Schisandra chinensis (Trucz.) Baill (a widely used traditional Chinese medicine). The present study aimed to characterize the effect of SCH-C on memory impairment and further research on pathological changes in Abeta1-42 -induced Alzheimer's disease mice. Mice were administration with SCH-C daily for 5 days in the lateral cerebral ventricles using sterotaxically implanted cannula. Cognitive functions were assessed by Y-maze test, active avoidance test and Morris water maze test in all groups, and the level of Abeta1-42 and neuronal injury induced by Abeta1-42 were reversed remarkably following SCH-C treatment compared with sham group; meanwhile the impairment of short-term or working memory was dramatically improved. In addition, SCH-C significantly inhibited total cholinesterase (ChEtotal), and increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-px) activity glutathione (GSH) levels in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex. It can be speculated that SCH-C offers protection against Abeta1-42 -induced dysfunction in learning and memory by inhibiting ChEtotal and its antioxidant action.
