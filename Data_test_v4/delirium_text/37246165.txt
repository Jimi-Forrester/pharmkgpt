37246165|t|Identifying Novel Drug Targets for Epilepsy Through a Brain Transcriptome-Wide Association Study and Protein-Wide Association Study with Chemical-Gene-Interaction Analysis.
37246165|a|Epilepsy is a severe neurological condition affecting 50-65 million individuals worldwide that can lead to brain damage. Nevertheless, the etiology of epilepsy remains poorly understood. Meta-analyses of genome-wide association studies involving 15,212 epilepsy cases and 29,677 controls of the ILAE Consortium cohort were used to conduct transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) and protein-wide association studies (PWAS). Furthermore, a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was generated using the STRING database, and significant epilepsy-susceptible genes were verified using chip data. Chemical-related gene set enrichment analysis (CGSEA) was performed to determine novel drug targets for epilepsy. TWAS analysis identified 21,170 genes, of which 58 were significant (TWASfdr < 0.05) in ten brain regions, and 16 differentially expressed genes were verified based on mRNA expression profiles. The PWAS identified 2249 genes, of which 2 were significant (PWASfdr < 0.05). Through chemical-gene set enrichment analysis, 287 environmental chemicals associated with epilepsy were identified. We identified five significant genes (WIPF1, IQSEC1, JAM2, ICAM3, and ZNF143) that had causal relationships with epilepsy. CGSEA identified 159 chemicals that were significantly correlated with epilepsy (Pcgsea < 0.05), such as pentobarbital, ketone bodies, and polychlorinated biphenyl. In summary, we performed TWAS, PWAS (for genetic factors), and CGSEA (for environmental factors) analyses and identified several epilepsy-associated genes and chemicals. The results of this study will contribute to our understanding of genetic and environmental factors for epilepsy and may predict novel drug targets.
