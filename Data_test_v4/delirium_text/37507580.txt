37507580|a|BACKGROUND: Post-COVID-19 syndrome (PCS) is a lingering disease with ongoing symptoms such as fatigue and cognitive impairment resulting in a high impact on the daily life of patients. Understanding the pathophysiology of PCS is a public health priority, as it still poses a diagnostic and treatment challenge for physicians. METHODS: In this prospective observational cohort study, we analyzed the retinal microcirculation using Retinal Vessel Analysis (RVA) in a cohort of patients with PCS and compared it to an age- and gender-matched healthy cohort (n = 41, matched out of n = 204). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: PCS patients exhibit persistent endothelial dysfunction (ED), as indicated by significantly lower venular flicker-induced dilation (vFID; 3.42% +- 1.77% vs. 4.64% +- 2.59%; p = 0.02), narrower central retinal artery equivalent (CRAE; 178.1 [167.5-190.2] vs. 189.1 [179.4-197.2], p = 0.01) and lower arteriolar-venular ratio (AVR; (0.84 [0.8-0.9] vs. 0.88 [0.8-0.9], p = 0.007). When combining AVR and vFID, predicted scores reached good ability to discriminate groups (area under the curve: 0.75). Higher PCS severity scores correlated with lower AVR (R = - 0.37 p = 0.017). The association of microvascular changes with PCS severity were amplified in PCS patients exhibiting higher levels of inflammatory parameters. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that prolonged endothelial dysfunction is a hallmark of PCS, and impairments of the microcirculation seem to explain ongoing symptoms in patients. As potential therapies for PCS emerge, RVA parameters may become relevant as clinical biomarkers for diagnosis and therapy management. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study was previously registered at ClinicalTrials ("All Eyes on PCS-Analysis of the Retinal Microvasculature in Patients with Post-COVID-19 Syndrome". NCT05635552. https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05635552 ). Persistent endothelial dysfunction in post-COVID-19 syndrome. Acute SARS-CoV-2 infection indirectly or directly causes endotheliitis in patients. N = 41 PCS patients were recruited and retinal vessel analysis was performed to assess microvascular endothelial function. Images of SVA and DVA are illustrative for RVA data analysis. For each PCS patient and healthy cohort, venular vessel diameter of the three measurement cycles was calculated and plotted on a diameter-time curve. Patients exhibited reduced flicker-induced dilation in veins (vFID) measured by dynamic vessel analysis (DVA) and lower central retinal arteriolar equivalent (CRAE) and arteriolar-venular ratio (AVR) and a tendency towards higher central retinal venular equivalent (CRVE) when compared to SARS-CoV-2 infection naive participants.
