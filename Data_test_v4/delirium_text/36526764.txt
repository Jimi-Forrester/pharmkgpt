36526764|t|Professional delays in referral of patients with mouth cancer: six case histories.
36526764|a|Professional delay is an important delay in referral of patients with suspected mouth cancer. Missing the possibility of cancer might not only result in worse outcomes in respect to function and survival, but also have medicolegal implications. The aim of this article was to review a consecutive cohort of patients over a two-year period with mouth cancer diagnosis and identify those with professional delay and illustrate the main types of presentations using short case histories. The multi-disciplinary team records were used to identify case notes of a two-year (2019 and 2020) consecutive cohort of patients diagnosed with mouth cancer, including referrals from primary and secondary care. Professional delay was considered if red flag symptoms were not referred within two weeks or if there was initial misdiagnosis. In total, 246 patients with mouth cancer were discussed with the multi-disciplinary team: 35 had delay in referral or misdiagnosis of mouth cancer. Six common scenarios were identified: 1) sudden onset paraesthesia; 2) dental abscess; 3) temporomandibular joint dysfunction syndrome (TMJD) and abscess; 4) TMJD; 5) trauma/facial fracture; and 6) non-healing socket following dental extraction. To conclude, it can be difficult to accurately diagnose mouth cancer in primary dental and medical care and an index of suspicion is essential in order to minimise the possibility of professional delay.
