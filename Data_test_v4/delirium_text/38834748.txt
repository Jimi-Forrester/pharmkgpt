38834748|a|PURPOSE: Understanding the complex bidirectional interactions between neurons and glioma cells could help to identify new therapeutic targets. Herein, the techniques and application of novel neuroscience tools implemented to study the complex interactions between brain and malignant gliomas, their results, and the potential therapeutic opportunities were reviewed. METHODS: Literature search was performed on PubMed between 2001 and 2023 using the keywords "glioma", "glioblastoma", "circuit remodeling", "plasticity", "neuron networks" and "cortical networks". Studies including grade 2 to 4 gliomas, diffuse midline gliomas, and diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas were considered. RESULTS: Glioma cells are connected through tumour microtubes and form a highly connected network within which pacemaker cells drive tumorigenesis. Unconnected cells have increased invasion capabilities. Glioma cells are also synaptically integrated within neural circuitry. Neurons promote tumour growth via paracrine and direct electrochemical mechanisms, including glutamatergic AMPA-receptors. Increased glutamate release in the tumor microenvironment and loss of peritumoral GABAergic inhibitory interneurons result in network hyperexcitability and secondary epilepsy. Functional imaging, local field potentials and subcortical mapping, performed in awake patients, have defined patterns of malignant circuit remodeling. Glioma-induced remodeling is frequent in language and even motor cortical networks, depending on tumour biological parameters, and influences functional outcomes. CONCLUSION: These data offer new insights into glioma tumorigenesis. Future work will be needed to understand how tumor intrinsic molecular drivers influence neuron-glioma interactions but also to integrate these results to design new therapeutic options for patients.
