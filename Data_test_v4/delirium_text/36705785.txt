36705785|a|BACKGROUND: The present study aimed to determine whether patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD), semantic verbal fluency (SVF), and the semantic-phonemic discrepancy (SPD) could predict abnormal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) phosphorylated tau (P-tau181) and total tau (T-tau) levels. METHODS: Phonemic verbal fluency (PVF) and SVF scores of N = 116 Abeta-positive patients with either MCI due to AD (N = 39) or probable AD dementia (ADD; N = 77) were retrospectively collected. The SPD was computed by subtracting PVF scores from SVF ones (positive and negative values corresponding to a semantic and phonemic advantage, respectively). Patients were cognitively phenotyped via a thorough test battery and profiled according to the amyloidosis/tauopathy/neurodegeneration (ATN) framework via CSF analyses. Two separate sets of logistic regressions were run to predict normal vs. abnormal P-tau181 and T-tau levels by encompassing as predictors SVF + PVF and SPD and covarying for demographic, disease-related features, and cognitive profile. RESULTS: Lower SVF, but not PVF, scores, as well as a greater phonemic advantage (i.e., negative SPD values), predicted abnormal CSF P-tau181 levels (p <= .01). Moreover, lower SVF scores were selectively predictive of abnormal CSF T-tau levels too (p = .016), while the SPD was not. DISCUSSION: SVF and the SPD are able to predict tauopathy across the AD spectrum, thus supporting their status of valid, and sufficiently specific, cognitive markers of AD.
