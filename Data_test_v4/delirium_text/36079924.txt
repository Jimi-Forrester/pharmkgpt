36079924|a|Hyperglycemia is one of the important causes of neurodegenerative disorders and aging. Aquilaria crassna Pierre ex Lec (AC) has been widely used to relieve various health ailments. However, the neuroprotective and anti-aging effects against high glucose induction have not been investigated. This study aimed to investigate the effects of hexane extract of AC leaves (ACH) in vitro using human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells and in vivo using nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. SH-SY5Y cells and C. elegans were pre-exposed with high glucose, followed by ACH treatment. To investigate neuroprotective activities, neurite outgrowth and cell cycle progression were determined in SH-SY5Y cells. In addition, C. elegans was used to determine ACH effects on antioxidant activity, longevity, and healthspan. In addition, ACH phytochemicals were analyzed and the possible active compounds were identified using a molecular docking study. ACH exerted neuroprotective effects by inducing neurite outgrowth via upregulating growth-associated protein 43 and teneurin-4 expression and normalizing cell cycle progression through the regulation of cyclin D1 and SIRT1 expression. Furthermore, ACH prolonged lifespan, improved body size, body length, and brood size, and reduced intracellular ROS accumulation in high glucose-induced C. elegans via the activation of gene expression in the DAF-16/FoxO pathway. Finally, phytochemicals of ACH were analyzed and revealed that beta-sitosterol and stigmasterol were the possible active constituents in inhibiting insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGFR). The results of this study establish ACH as an alternative medicine to defend against high glucose effects on neurotoxicity and aging.
