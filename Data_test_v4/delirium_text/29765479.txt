29765479|a|Evodiamine, a major component of Evodia rutaecarpa, has been reported to possess various pharmacological activities, including anti-inflammatory, antioxidative stress, and neuroprotective effects. Our previous study has shown that the potential effects of evodiamine on the learning and memory impairments in the transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The present study was designed to investigate neuroprotective mechanism and therapeutic potential of evodiamine against intracerebroventricular streptozotocin (ICV-STZ)-induced experimental sporadic Alzheimer's disease in mice. STZ was injected twice intracerebroventrically (3 mg/kg ICV) on alternate days (day 1 and day 3) in mice. Daily oral administration with evodiamine (50 or 100 mg/kg per day) starting from the first dose of STZ for 21 days showed an improvement in STZ induced cognitive deficits as assessed by novel object recognition and Morris water maze test. Evodiamine significantly decreased STZ induced elevation in acetylcholinesterase activity and malondialdehyde level, and significantly increased STZ induced reduction in glutathione activities and superoxide dismutase activities in the hippocampus compared to control. Furthermore, evodiamine inhibited significantly glial cell activation and neuroinflammation (TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6 levels) in the hippocampus. Moreover, evodiamine increased the activity of AKT/GSK-3beta signalling pathway and inhibited the activity of nuclear factor kappaB. In summary, our study suggests that evodiamine can be a novel therapeutic agent for the management of sporadic AD.
