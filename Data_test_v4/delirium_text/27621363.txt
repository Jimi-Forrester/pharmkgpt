27621363|a|Intracellular trafficking is an essential and conserved eukaryotic process. Rab GTPases are a family of proteins that regulate and provide specificity for discrete membrane trafficking steps by harnessing a nucleotide-bound cycle. Global proteomic screens have revealed many Rab GTPases as phosphoproteins, but the effects of this modification are not well understood. Using the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rab GTPase Sec4p as a model, we have found that phosphorylation negatively regulates Sec4p function by disrupting the interaction with the exocyst complex via Sec15p. We demonstrate that phosphorylation of Sec4p is a cell cycle-dependent process associated with cytokinesis. Through a genomic kinase screen, we have also identified the polo-like kinase Cdc5p as a positive regulator of Sec4p phosphorylation. Sec4p spatially and temporally localizes with Cdc5p exclusively when Sec4p phosphorylation levels peak during the cell cycle, indicating Sec4p is a direct Cdc5p substrate. Our data suggest the physiological relevance of Sec4p phosphorylation is to facilitate the coordination of membrane-trafficking events during cytokinesis.
