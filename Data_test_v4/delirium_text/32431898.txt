32431898|t|Design, synthesis, molecular modelling and in vitro screening of monoamine oxidase inhibitory activities of novel quinazolyl hydrazine derivatives.
32431898|a|A new series of N'-substituted benzylidene-2-(4-oxo-2-phenyl-1,4-dihydroquinazolin-3(2H)-yl)acetohydrazide (5a-5h) has been synthesized, characterized by FT-IR, NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry and tested against human monoamine oxidase (MAO) A and B. Only (4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzylidene) substituted compounds gave submicromolar inhibition of MAO-A and MAO-B. Changing the phenyl substituent to methyl on the unsaturated quinazoline ring (12a-12d) decreased inhibition, but a less flexible linker (14a-14d) resulted in selective micromolar inhibition of hMAO-B providing insight for ongoing design.
