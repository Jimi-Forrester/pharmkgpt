16100990|t|[Semantic dementia: clinical and neuroimaging evaluation. Case report].
16100990|a|Semantic dementia is a clinical syndrome in the spectrum of frontotemporal lobar degeneration group. We report on a 63 years old man who presented with memory disorder of semantic nature for visual and mainly verbal material when he was 57 years old. Mild behavior impairment was present and related to exaggerated responses to algic stimuli and repetitive behavior. Structural and functional neuroimaging methods disclosed asymmetric bitemporal damage, mainly on the left. Differential diagnosis should be considered with Alzheimer's disease, another subtypes of the frontotemporal lobar degeneration group and any other syndrome that presents with a fluent aphasic progressive disorder.
