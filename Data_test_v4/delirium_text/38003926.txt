38003926|t|Clinical Characteristics of Spinal versus General Anaesthesia in Older Patients Undergoing Hip Fracture Repair Surgery in Jordan: A Multicentre Study.
38003926|a|BACKGROUND: The primary aim of this study was to examine the clinical characteristics and outcomes of older patients who underwent hip fracture repair surgery. The secondary aims were to assess the predictors of the choice of spinal or general anaesthesia and to explore the risk factors for all-cause mortality. METHODS: This three-tertiary centres study was conducted at a tertiary care centre in Jordan. Clinical data include previous fracture history; medication details; comorbidities; surgical approach; and postoperative pain management. RESULTS: Overall, 1084 patients who underwent hip fracture repair were included in this study. The mean age of patients was 78 years, and 55.2% were women. Twenty-four were treated with bisphosphonates before the fracture, whereas 30 were in steroid therapy. Overall, 61.8% of patients underwent spinal anaesthesia, whereas 38.2% underwent general anaesthesia. Spinal anaesthesia group had a lower prevalence of cardiovascular accidents (16.3% vs. 22.3%, p = 0.014) and Alzheimer's (3.4% vs. 1.4%, p = 0.049) than the general anaesthesia group. In the spinal anaesthesia group, postoperative opioid administration (p = 0.025) and postoperative blood transfusion (p = 0.011) occurred more frequently than general anaesthesia group. In hospital, 30-day and all-cause mortality were comparable between both groups. Diabetes mellitus (HR = 2.6; 95%CI = 1.5-4.4; p = 0.001); cemented hip hemiarthroplasty (HR = 2.4; 95%CI = 1.1-5.1; p = 0.025); deep venous thrombosis/pulmonary embolism (HR = 5.0; 95%CI = 1.2-12.9; p = 0.001); and readmission within 1 month from surgery (HR = 3.6; 95%CI = 2.0-6.3; p < 0.001) were all significant predictors of mortality. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides insights into the outcomes and factors associated with different anaesthesia types in hip fracture repair surgery. The anaesthesia type does not affect all-cause mortality in patients undergoing hip fracture repair.
