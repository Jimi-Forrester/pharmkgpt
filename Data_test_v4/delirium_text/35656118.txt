35656118|t|Intestinal Flora: A Potential New Regulator of Cardiovascular Disease.
35656118|a|Although substantial progress has been made in reducing the burden of the disease by preventing the risk factors of cardiovascular disease (CVD), potential risk factors still exist and lead to its progression. In recent years, numerous studies have revealed that intestinal flora can interfere with the physiological processes of the host through changes in composition and function or related metabolites. Intestinal flora thus affects the occurrence and development of a variety of CVDs, including atherosclerosis, ischemic heart disease, and heart failure. Moreover, studies have found that interventions for intestinal flora and its metabolites provide new opportunities for CVD treatment. This article mainly discusses the interaction between the human intestinal flora and its metabolites, the occurrence and development of CVD, and the potential of intestinal flora as a new target for the diagnosis and treatment of CVD.
