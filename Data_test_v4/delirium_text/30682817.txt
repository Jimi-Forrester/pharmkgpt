30682817|t|Emerging Roles of Ephexins in Physiology and Disease.
30682817|a|Dbl (B-cell lymphoma)-related guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), the largest family of GEFs, are directly responsible for the activation of Rho family GTPases and essential for a number of cellular events such as proliferation, differentiation and movement. The members of the Ephexin (Eph-interacting exchange protein) family, a subgroup of Dbl GEFs, initially were named for their interaction with Eph receptors and sequence homology with Ephexin1. Although the first Ephexin was identified about two decades ago, their functions in physiological and pathological contexts and regulatory mechanisms remained elusive until recently. Ephexins are now considered as GEFs that can activate Rho GTPases such as RhoA, Rac, Cdc42, and RhoG. Moreover, Ephexins have been shown to have pivotal roles in neural development, tumorigenesis, and efferocytosis. In this review, we discuss the known and proposed functions of Ephexins in physiological and pathological contexts, as well as their regulatory mechanisms.
