32357528|t|Pharmacogenomics of Cognitive Dysfunction and Neuropsychiatric Disorders in Dementia.
32357528|a|Symptomatic interventions for patients with dementia involve anti-dementia drugs to improve cognition, psychotropic drugs for the treatment of behavioral disorders (BDs), and different categories of drugs for concomitant disorders. Demented patients may take >6-10 drugs/day with the consequent risk for drug-drug interactions and adverse drug reactions (ADRs >80%) which accelerate cognitive decline. The pharmacoepigenetic machinery is integrated by pathogenic, mechanistic, metabolic, transporter, and pleiotropic genes redundantly and promiscuously regulated by epigenetic mechanisms. CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4/5 geno-phenotypes are involved in the metabolism of over 90% of drugs currently used in patients with dementia, and only 20% of the population is an extensive metabolizer for this tetragenic cluster. ADRs associated with anti-dementia drugs, antipsychotics, antidepressants, anxiolytics, hypnotics, sedatives, and antiepileptic drugs can be minimized by means of pharmacogenetic screening prior to treatment. These drugs are substrates, inhibitors, or inducers of 58, 37, and 42 enzyme/protein gene products, respectively, and are transported by 40 different protein transporters. APOE is the reference gene in most pharmacogenetic studies. APOE-3 carriers are the best responders and APOE-4 carriers are the worst responders; likewise, CYP2D6-normal metabolizers are the best responders and CYP2D6-poor metabolizers are the worst responders. The incorporation of pharmacogenomic strategies for a personalized treatment in dementia is an effective option to optimize limited therapeutic resources and to reduce unwanted side-effects.
