38299253|a|OBJECTIVE: To examine the clinical characteristics of over-the-counter (OTC) drug abusers in psychiatric practice in Japan. METHOD: We examined the attributes, ICD-10 subcategory, and comorbid mental disorders of patients who mainly abuse OTC products and compared the clinical characteristics of single product and multiple products abusers, using the database of the "2022 Nationwide Mental Hospital Survey of Drug-related Disorders." RESULTS: Among the 2468 subjects included in this survey, 273 (11.1%) used OTC products as main drugs. Of these, 209 (78.3%) and 58 (21.7%) were classified into the single product group and the multiple products group, respectively. Six were excluded for unknown ingredients. By comparing these groups, we found that many of the multiple products group consisted of young women who were recently treated for drug problems. Many subjects in the group also had a short treatment period. No differences were observed between the groups regarding the ICD-10 F1 subcategory, but many subjects in the multiple products group fulfilled the criteria of F6 "disorders of adult personality and behavior." CONCLUSION: OTC products are easily accessible drugs of abuse for young women in Japan. The results of this study indicate the necessity to reconsider the educational approach for preventing drug abuse, which has focused on illicit drugs. The study also indicates that some OTC products, which contain ingredients banned overseas due to their harmful effects, are still sold in Japan and that abusers for those products exist. Measures by the government are considered urgently needed.
