36233197|t|ATR-FTIR Biosensors for Antibody Detection and Analysis.
36233197|a|Quality control of drug products is of paramount importance in the pharmaceutical world. It ensures product safety, efficiency, and consistency. In the case of complex biomolecules such as therapeutic proteins, small variations in bioprocess parameters can induce substantial variations in terms of structure, impacting the drug product quality. Conditions for obtaining highly reproducible grafting of 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid were determined. On that basis, we developed an easy-to-use, cost effective, and timesaving biosensor based on ATR-FTIR spectroscopy able to detect immunoglobulins during their production. A germanium crystal, used as an internal reflection element (IRE) for FTIR spectroscopy, was covalently coated with immunoglobulin-binding proteins. This thereby functionalized surface could bind only immunoglobulins present in complex media such as culture media or biopharmaceutical products. The potential subsequent analysis of their structure by ATR-FTIR spectroscopy makes this biosensor a powerful tool to monitor the production of biotherapeutics and assess important critical quality attributes (CQAs) such as high-order structure and aggregation level.
