33543759|t|Systemic Opioid Prescribing Patterns and Total Cost of Care in Patients Initiating Spinal Cord Stimulation Therapy: A Retrospective Analysis.
33543759|a|BACKGROUND: Few studies have evaluated patterns of systemic opioid use among patients initiating spinal cord stimulation therapy for chronic pain. This study evaluated systemic opioid discontinuation and/or dose reduction and total health care cost after the start of spinal cord stimulation therapy. METHODS: Using a commercial insurance claims database (2008-2017), we analyzed opioid utilization patterns in patients initiating spinal cord stimulation therapy over a 1-year baseline and 2-year follow-up. The primary end point was defined as either discontinuation (>=365-day gap between prescription fills or total days' supply in follow-up <=30 days) or >=50% reduction in average daily morphine milligram equivalent dose. "Costs" were defined as total payer plus patient out-of-pocket payments. RESULTS: A total of 5,878 patients met the selection criteria. Of these, 152 (2.6%) showed no opioid prescription data at any point in the study period. Among patients with one or more prescriptions, 42.0% met the primary end point (22.0% discontinued, and 20.0% reduced their dose by 50% or more). Mean total adjusted costs were significantly reduced in years 1 and 2 of follow-up relative to baseline (excluding device insertion costs). The average time to breakeven when accounting for device trial and permanent insertion cost was 3.1 years among those who met the composite end point and 4.2 years among those who did not. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis shows that among patients who continued spinal cord stimulation therapy for at least 2 years, a significant proportion were able to reduce and/or discontinue systemic opioid use, with costs after the start of therapy significantly reduced relative to baseline.
