39085273|t|Comparative efficacy of totally thoracoscopic, mini-thoracotomy, and mini-sternotomy approaches in aortic valve replacement.
39085273|a|Aortic valve replacement (AVR) is a critical procedure for patients with aortic valve diseases. This study compares the effectiveness of three minimally-invasive surgical approaches for AVR: totally thoracoscopic (TT), right anterior mini-thoracotomy, and upper mini-sternotomy. We analyzed retrospective data from 130 patients who underwent one of these surgeries, focusing on various factors such as duration of hospital stay, operation time, times for cardiopulmonary bypass and aortic cross-clamping, postoperative complications, levels of cardiac biomarkers, pain intensity using the Visual Analog Scale, and mid-term survival rates. Results show that while the TT method had the longest operation times, it also had the shortest hospital stays and faster pain reduction post-surgery. Although the TT group initially showed higher cardiac biomarker levels after surgery, these levels normalized by the third day, similar to the other groups. There were no significant differences in mid-term survival and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular event (MACCE) rates among the groups. These findings suggest that the TT method, despite longer surgical times, offers a quicker initial recovery, making it a viable option for AVR.
