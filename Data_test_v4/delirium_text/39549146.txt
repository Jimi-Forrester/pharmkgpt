39549146|a|It is well known that the development of neurodegeneration, and especially Alzheimer's disease (AD), is often accompanied by impaired olfaction which precedes memory loss. A neuropeptidase neprilysin (NEP)-a principal amyloid-degrading enzyme in the brain-was also shown to be involved in olfactory signalling. Previously we have demonstrated that 5xFAD mice develop olfactory deficit by the age of 6 months which correlated with reduced NEP expression in the brain areas involved in olfactory signalling. The aim of this study was to analyse the effect of administration of a histone deacetylase inhibitor, valproic acid (VA), to adult 5xFAD mice on their olfaction and memory as well as on brain morphology and NEP expression in the parietal cortex (PC) and hippocampus (Hip). The data obtained demonstrated that administration of VA to 7-month-old mice (200 mg/kg of body weight) for 28 days resulted in improvement of their memory in the Morris water maze as well as olfaction in the odor preference and food search tests. This correlated with increased expression of NEP in the PC and Hip as well as a reduced number of amyloid plaques in these brain areas. This strongly suggests that NEP can be considered an important therapeutic target not only in AD but also in olfactory loss.
