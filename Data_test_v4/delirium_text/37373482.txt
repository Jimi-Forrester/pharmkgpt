37373482|a|Advances in spine surgery enable technically safe interventions in older patients with disabling spine disease, yet postoperative delirium (POD) poses a serious risk for postoperative recovery. This study investigates biomarkers of pro-neuroinflammatory states that may help objectively define the pre-operative risk for POD. This study enrolled patients aged >=60 scheduled for elective spine surgery under general anesthesia. Biomarkers for a pro-neuroinflammatory state included S100 calcium-binding protein beta (S100beta), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), Gasdermin D, and the soluble ectodomain of the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (sTREM2). Postoperative changes of Interleukin-6 (IL-6), Interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), and C-reactive protein (CRP) were assessed as markers of systemic inflammation preoperatively, intraoperatively, and early postoperatively (up to 48 h). Patients with POD (n = 19, 75.7 +- 5.8 years) had higher pre-operative levels of sTREM2 (128.2 +- 69.4 pg/mL vs. 97.2 +- 52.0 pg/mL, p = 0.049) and Gasdermin D (2.9 +- 1.6 pg/mL vs. 2.1 +- 1.4 pg/mL, p = 0.29) than those without POD (n = 25, 75.6 +- 5.1 years). STREM2 was additionally a predictor for POD (OR = 1.01/(pg/mL) [1.00-1.03], p = 0.05), moderated by IL-6 (Wald-chi2 = 4.06, p = 0.04). Patients with POD additionally showed a significant increase in IL-6, IL-1beta, and S100beta levels on the first postoperative day. This study identified higher levels of sTREM2 and Gasdermin D as potential markers of a pro-neuroinflammatory state that predisposes to the development of POD. Future studies should confirm these results in a larger cohort and determine their potential as an objective biomarker to inform delirium prevention strategies.
