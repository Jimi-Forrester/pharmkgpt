35038708|t|Prevalence of Delirium in End-of-Life Palliative Care Patients: An Observational Study.
35038708|a|OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of delirium, using the Assessment Test for Delirium and Cognitive Impairment (4AT) in end-of-life palliative care patients. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted on end-of-life patients in a hospice or at home. All patients were evaluated with the 4AT for the presence of delirium. RESULTS: Of the 461 patients analyzed, 76 (16.5%) were inpatients and 83.5% (385) outpatients. The median age was 79.5 (72-86) years, and 51.0% were female. According to the 4AT score, 126 patients (27.3%) had delirium (A4T >=4) at admission, 28 (36.8%) were inpatients, and 98 (25.5%) outpatients. Around 33.8% of the cancer inpatients had delirium, while 20.6% of the cancer outpatients had delirium. The prevalence of delirium varied according to the setting, clinical condition, and life expectancy. In addition, 55.0% (11) actively dying inpatients, within 3 days, had delirium, and 56.7% (17) outpatients had delirium; while among those with life expectancy longer than 4 days, 30.4% (17) inpatients and 22.8% (81) outpatients were with delirium. CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms that delirium is common in cancer and noncancer palliative care patients. Further research on delirium in end-of-life palliative care patients should consider the complexity of palliative care of this population as well as of the characteristics of the settings.
