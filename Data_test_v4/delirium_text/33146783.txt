33146783|a|BACKGROUND: With an ageing population, it is paramount for surgeons to comprehend the implications of age on surgical outcomes. This study aims to identify the effects of age on perioperative outcomes post-hepatectomy. METHODS: Between 2001 and 2017, 357 hepatectomies were performed in our centre for malignancy. Data recorded include demographic, histopathology and perioperative outcomes. Patients were divided into three age groups (Group 1 < 65 years, Group 2 65-74 years, Group 3 >= 75 years). RESULTS: With increasing age, there was a trend towards patient having: ASA >= 3 (from 32.1% to 60.9%, p < 0.0001), clear margins (from 80.4% to 88.3%, p = 0.2256), days of hospitalisation (from 9.5 +- 6.9 to 12 +- 8.0, p = 0.0003), days of ICU admission (from 2.3 +- 2.8 to 2.8 +- 12.9, p = 0.0790) and morbidity (from 39% to 58.5%, p = 0.0073). Cardiovascular complications and postoperative delirium increase with age. There was no significant difference in mortality across the three groups. Univariate and bivariate binary logistic regressions found no association between mortality and age. When adjusted for age, 30- and 90-day mortality was significantly associated with Clavien-Dindo >= 3, length of hospital and cardiac complications. Additionally, 90-day mortality was significantly associated with ASA score >=3, mass of liver resected, length of ICU stay and hepatobiliary, pulmonary and genitourinary complications. CONCLUSION: Increased age is associated with increased post-hepatectomy complications, prolonged hospital stay and ICU admission. However, age itself is not a contraindication for hepatectomy and is not associated with increased mortality. Good histopathology outcomes and low mortality rates are achievable with careful patient selection and appropriate perioperative management.
