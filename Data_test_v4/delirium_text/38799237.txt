38799237|a|Obesity and related metabolic syndromes have been recognized as important disease risks, in which the role of adipokines cannot be ignored. Adiponectin (ADP) is one of the key adipokines with various beneficial effects, including improving glucose and lipid metabolism, enhancing insulin sensitivity, reducing oxidative stress and inflammation, promoting ceramides degradation, and stimulating adipose tissue vascularity. Based on those, it can serve as a positive regulator in many metabolic syndromes, such as type 2 diabetes (T2D), cardiovascular diseases, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), sarcopenia, neurodegenerative diseases, and certain cancers. Therefore, a promising therapeutic approach for treating various metabolic diseases may involve elevating ADP levels or activating ADP receptors. The modulation of ADP genes, multimerization, and secretion covers the main processes of ADP generation, providing a comprehensive orientation for the development of more appropriate therapeutic strategies. In order to have a deeper understanding of ADP, this paper will provide an all-encompassing review of ADP.
