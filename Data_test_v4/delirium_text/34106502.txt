34106502|t|Characterizing white matter alterations subject to clinical laterality in drug-naive de novo Parkinson's disease.
34106502|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by a range of motor and nonmotor symptoms, often with the motor dysfunction initiated unilaterally. Knowledge regarding disease-related alterations in white matter pathways can effectively help improve the understanding of the disease and propose targeted treatment strategies. Microstructural imaging techniques, including diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), allows inspection of white matter integrity to study the pathogenesis of various neurological conditions. Previous voxel-based analyses with DTI measures, such as fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity have uncovered changes in brain regions that are associated with PD, but the conclusions were inconsistent, partially due to small patient cohorts and the lack of consideration for clinical laterality onset, particularly in early PD. Fixel-based analysis (FBA) is a recent framework that offers tract-specific insights regarding white matter health, but very few FBA studies on PD exist. We present a study that reveals strengthened and weakened white matter integrity that is subject to symptom laterality in a large drug-naive de novo PD cohort using complementary DTI and FBA measures. The findings suggest that the disease gives rise to tissue degeneration and potential re-organization in the early stage.
