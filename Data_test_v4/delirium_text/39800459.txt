39800459|a|INTRODUCTION: Informal care estimates for use in health-economic models are lacking. We aimed to estimate the association between informal care time and dementia symptoms across Europe. METHODS: A secondary analysis was performed on 13,529 observations in 5,369 persons from 9 European pooled cohort or trial studies in community-dwelling persons with dementia. A mixed regression model was fitted to time spent on instrumental or basic activities of daily living using disease severity and demographic characteristics. RESULTS: Daily informal care time was 0.5 hours higher in moderate compared to mild and 1.3h higher in severe compared to mild cognitive impairment. Likewise, this was 1.2h and 2.7h for functional disability and 0.3h and 0.6h for behavioral symptoms in the same directions. DISCUSSION: Estimates can be used in both single- and multi-domain health-economic models for dementia in European settings.
