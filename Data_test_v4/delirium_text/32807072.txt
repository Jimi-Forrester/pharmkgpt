32807072|a|Neuropathic pain (NP) is a sustained and nonreversible condition characterized by long-term devastating physical and psychological damage. Therefore, it is urgent to identify an effective treatment for NP. Unfortunately, the precise pathogenesis of NP has not been elucidated. Currently, the microbiota-gut-brain axis has drawn increasing attention, and the emerging role of gut microbiota is investigated in numerous diseases including NP. Gut microbiota is considered as a pivotal regulator in immune, neural, endocrine, and metabolic signaling pathways, which participates in forming a complex network to affect the development of NP directly or indirectly. In this review, we conclude the current understanding of preclinical and clinical findings regarding the role of gut microbiota in NP and provide a novel therapeutic method for pain relief by medication and dietary interventions.
