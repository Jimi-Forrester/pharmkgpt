34929080|t|Quantum Sensing of Free Radicals in Primary Human Dendritic Cells.
34929080|a|Free radicals are crucial indicators for stress and appear in all kinds of pathogenic conditions, including cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and infection. However, they are difficult to detect due to their reactivity and low abundance. We use relaxometry for the detection of radicals with subcellular resolution. This method is based on a fluorescent defect in a diamond, which changes its optical properties on the basis of the magnetic surroundings. This technique allows nanoscale MRI with unprecedented sensitivity and spatial resolution. Recently, this technique was used inside living cells from a cell line. Cell lines differ in terms of endocytic capability and radical production from primary cells derived from patients. Here we provide the first measurements of phagocytic radical production by the NADPH oxidase (NOX2) in primary dendritic cells from healthy donors. The radical production of these cells differs greatly between donors. We investigated the cell response to stimulation or inhibition.
