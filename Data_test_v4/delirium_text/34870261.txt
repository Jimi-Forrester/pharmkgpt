34870261|a|BACKGROUND: Post-COVID-19 disease is not yet clearly described, presenting significant clinical variability across populations and patients. This paper compares post-COVID symptoms in three patient groups with mild, moderate, and severe infections in Ecuadorian outpatients. METHODS: An epidemiological, observational, descriptive, and cross-sectional study was performed, and carried out in Quito, Ecuador. 1,366 non-hospitalized participants between 12 to 85 years, diagnosed with COVID-19 infection by molecular RT-PCR were included in the study. Demographic characteristics, including age groups, sex, ethnic group, work type, residence type, comorbidities, diagnosis, symptoms, and treatment were studied. FINDINGS: 1,366 outpatient Ecuadorian patients were analysed with SARS-CoV2 infection confirmed with a PCR+ test. The mean age was 39 (+- 10) years, distributed by age groups ranging between 12 and 85 years; 81.41% were between 18 and 54 years. 50.29% were men, and 49.71% were women. INTERPRETATION: 64.3% of patients had symptoms between 4 to 6 weeks after infection, 21.1% showed ongoing symptoms between 6 to 12 weeks, and 14.6% had symptoms for more than 12 weeks. The most common symptom was fatigue in 67.3% of patients, followed by headache in 45.2%, body pain in 42.3%, and sleep disorders (insomnia, sleep apnoea, restless leg syndrome) in 36.5%. 69.3% of patients showed mild infection, 21.7% moderate, and 9.0% severe infection. On average, patients' daily life activities showed a 6.8% mean degree of impact following infection. A sedentary lifestyle (walking less than 30 minutes a day) was the most critical risk factor (40.3%), followed by being a health worker (11.87%). Patients aged >=55 years with HTN, CKD, smoking, and sedentary lifestyle were 4.39, 1.92, 9.19, 4.07, and 2.42 times more likely to have a severe infection level. At least 30% of patients do not feel recovered from COVID-19 infection. FUNDING: The author declares that the financial resources for the preparation of this research come from their self-management.
