26178596|t|A Functional Role for Abeta in Metal Homeostasis? N-Truncation and High-Affinity Copper Binding.
26178596|a|Accumulation of the beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptide in extracellular senile plaques rich in copper and zinc is a defining pathological feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The Abeta1-x (x=16/28/40/42) peptides have been the primary focus of Cu(II) binding studies for more than 15 years; however, the N-truncated Abeta4-42 peptide is a major Abeta isoform detected in both healthy and diseased brains, and it contains a novel N-terminal FRH sequence. Proteins with His at the third position are known to bind Cu(II) avidly, with conditional log K values at pH 7.4 in the range of 11.0-14.6, which is much higher than that determined for Abeta1-x peptides. By using Abeta4-16 as a model, it was demonstrated that its FRH sequence stoichiometrically binds Cu(II) with a conditional Kd value of 3x10(-14)  M at pH 7.4, and that both Abeta4-16 and Abeta4-42 possess negligible redox activity. Combined with the predominance of Abeta4-42 in the brain, our results suggest a physiological role for this isoform in metal homeostasis within the central nervous system.
