36722495|t|Subsystem mechanisms of default mode network underlying white matter hyperintensity-related cognitive impairment.
36722495|a|Functional changes of default mode network (DMN) have been proven to be closely associated with white matter hyperintensity (WMH) related cognitive impairment (CI). However, subsystem mechanisms of DMN underlying WMH-related CI remain unclear. The present study recruited WMH patients (n = 206) with mild CI and normal cognition, as well as healthy controls (HC, n = 102). Static/dynamic functional connectivity (FC) of the DMN's three subsystems were calculated using resting-state functional MRI. K-means clustering analyses were performed to extract distinct dynamic connectivity states. Compared with the WMH-NC group, the WMH-MCI group displayed lower static FC within medial temporal lobe (MTL) and core subsystem, between core-MTL subsystem, as well as between core and dorsal medial prefrontal cortex subsystem. All these static alterations were positively associated with information processing speed (IPS). Regarding dynamic FC, the WMH-MCI group exhibited higher dynamic FC within MTL subsystem than the HC and WMH-NC groups. Altered dynamic FC within MTL subsystem mediated the relationship between WMH and memory span (indirect effect: -0.2251, 95% confidence interval [-0.6295, -0.0267]). Additionally, dynamic FCs of DMN subsystems could be clustered into two recurring states. For dynamic FCs within MTL subsystem, WMH-MCI subjects exhibited longer mean dwell time (MDT) and higher reoccurrence fraction (RF) in a sparsely connected state (State 2). Altered MDT and RF in State 2 were negatively associated with IPS. Taken together, these findings indicated static/dynamic FC of DMN subsystems can provide relevant information on cognitive decline from different aspects, which provides a comprehensive view of subsystem mechanisms of DMN underlying WMH-related CI.
