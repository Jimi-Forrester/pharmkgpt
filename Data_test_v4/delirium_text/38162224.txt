38162224|t|Immigration and access to dementia diagnostics and treatment: A nationwide study in Sweden.
38162224|a| Compared to Swedish-born people, foreign-born people were less likely to receive dementia diagnostic tests. Being born in Africa or Europe was associated with lower chance of receiving cholinesterase inhibitors. Asian-born people had higher chance of receiving cholinesterase inhibitors, but were less likely to receive memantine. Disparities existed in dementia diagnostics and treatment between Swedish-born and foreign-born people, but were not consistent after adjusting for MMSE scores.
