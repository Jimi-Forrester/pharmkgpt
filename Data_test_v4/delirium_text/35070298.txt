35070298|a|The application of next-generation sequencing (NGS) in routine clinical analysis is still limited. The significance of NGS in the identification of pathogens of lower respiratory tract infection should be assessed as part of routine clinical bacterial examinations and chest imaging results. In the present study, the alveolar lavage fluid samples of 30 patients (25 males and 5 females, aged 19-92 years old, with a median age of 62) were examined by routine bacterial culture and NGS, and the results of pathogen detection and identification were compared. Chest imaging showed consolidation in all 30 patients (100%), and pleural effusion in 13 of the 30 patients (43.33%). The routine bacterial culture of the lavage solution was only positive in 14 of the 30 patients (46.6%), and negative in 16 patients (53.33%). However, the positive rate of NGS test results of the lavage fluid was 100%. A total of 12 cases (40%) were completely consistent with the routine bacterial culture test, with 56 other pathogens of mixed infection detected, accounting for the short comings of the routine bacterial examination. Although NGS cannot distinguish between live and dead bacteria, it is still a useful detection technology for accurate diagnosis of clinical infectious diseases. It is worthy of adaptation in the clinic for more effective clinical management and treatment of the lower respiratory airway infection in addition to the routine bacterial culture testing.
