28840566|t|Photo-Induced Oxidative Stress Impairs Mitochondrial Metabolism in Neurons and Astrocytes.
28840566|a|Photodynamic therapy is selective destruction of cells stained with a photosensitizer upon irradiation with light at a specific wavelength in the presence of oxygen. Cell death upon photodynamic treatment is known to occur mainly due to free radical production and subsequent development of oxidative stress. During photodynamic therapy of brain tumors, healthy cells are also damaged; considering this, it is important to investigate the effect of the treatment on normal neurons and glia. We employed live-cell imaging technique to investigate the cellular mechanism of photodynamic action of radachlorin (200 nM) on neurons and astrocytes in primary rat cell culture. We found that the photodynamic effect of radachlorin increases production of reactive oxygen species measured by dihydroethidium and significantly decrease mitochondrial membrane potential. Mitochondrial depolarization was independent of opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pore and was insensitive to blocker of this pore cyclosporine A. However, irradiation of cells with radachlorin dramatically decreased NADH autofluorescence and also reduced mitochondrial NADH pool suggesting inhibition of mitochondrial respiration by limitation of substrate. This effect could be prevented by inhibition of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) with DPQ. Thus, irradiation of neurons and astrocytes in the presence of radachlorin leads to activation of PARP and decrease in NADH that leads to mitochondrial dysfunction.
