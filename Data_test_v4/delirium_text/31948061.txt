31948061|t|Senile Osteoporosis: The Involvement of Differentiation and Senescence of Bone Marrow Stromal Cells.
31948061|a|Senile osteoporosis has become a worldwide bone disease with the aging of the world population. It increases the risk of bone fracture and seriously affects human health. Unlike postmenopausal osteoporosis which is linked to menopause in women, senile osteoporosis is due to aging, hence, affecting both men and women. It is commonly found in people with more than their 70s. Evidence has shown that with age increase, bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) differentiate into more adipocytes rather than osteoblasts and undergo senescence, which leads to decreased bone formation and contributes to senile osteoporosis. Therefore, it is necessary to uncover the molecular mechanisms underlying the functional changes of BMSCs. It will benefit not only for understanding the senile osteoporosis development, but also for finding new therapies to treat senile osteoporosis. Here, we review the recent advances of the functional alterations of BMSCs and the related mechanisms during senile osteoporosis development. Moreover, the treatment of senile osteoporosis by aiming at BMSCs is introduced.
