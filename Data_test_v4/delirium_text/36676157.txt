36676157|a|Turmeric is a strong-taste component of spices characteristic of Indian cuisine. It is obtained from the turmeric rhizome (Curcumae longae rhizoma) and has been used for thousands of years not only for culinary purposes, but also for medicinal purposes. It contains a group of organic compounds called curcuminoids. Curcumin is the main representative of this group of compounds which is also most frequently studied. In recent years, bioactive curcuminoids (including curcumin in the first place) have become more and more popular due to a wide spectrum of their biological activity. The anticancer, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and antiaging effects of curcumin have been confirmed by numerous in vitro and in vivo studies, as well as in clinical trials. However, an obstacle to simple, clinical application of curcumin is its poor bioavailability (which is due to its hydrophobic nature) and its very weak water solubility. Therefore, many scientists are working on improving the solubility of curcumin in water, which is the topic of the present article. Attempts have been made to combine curcumin with nanoparticles (polysaccharide or silica). Nanosuspensions or complexes with cyclodextrins are also considered. A promising direction is the search for new polymorphic varieties as well as obtaining cocrystals with curcumin which are characterized by better water solubility.
