39377601|t|Genomic characterization and clinical evaluation of prosthetic joint infections caused by Cutibacterium acnes.
39377601|a|Cutibacterium acnes is a major skin commensal that may act as an opportunistic pathogen. It is difficult to interpret findings of C. acnes in tissue cultures obtained during arthroplasty revision surgery, since they may represent true infection or contamination. This study investigated whether C. acnes obtained from prosthetic joint infections (PJIs) were related and shared common genomic traits that might correlate with clinical courses and patient outcomes. C. acnes isolates from revision surgery of patients with PJIs of the hip, shoulder, and knee were characterized using molecular methods to determine the sequence type (ST) and the presence of possible virulence determinants (Christie-Atkins-Munch-Peterson factors, dermatan sulfate-binding adhesion 1, hyaluronidase lyase, and linear plasmid). A standardized review of the patients' medical charts was performed. The study included 37 patients with C. acnes culture-positive tissue samples where multiple isolates of C. acnes belonged to the same ST. Most of the isolates belonged to phylotype IA1. Phylogenetic analysis of virulence determinants revealed no shared pattern among PJI isolates. Seven patients had a polymicrobial infection. Exchange revision was performed in 70% of the patients, and >50% of all patients received antibiotic treatment for >=3 months. Failure was noted in seven patients. No specific ST or any identifiable unique feature among virulence determinants were found among C. acnes isolated from PJIs of hips and shoulders. The majority of patients had low inflammatory markers and were treated successfully, even polymicrobial infections. However, failure was more common among shoulder infections compared with hip infections. IMPORTANCE: Prosthetic joint infection (PJI) is a rare complication after arthroplasty surgery. The infection seldom resolves without a combination of both surgical and antibiotic treatment and can cause significant suffering among affected patients. Cutibacterium acnes is a common skin bacterium that is most often found in shoulder PJIs but can also infect other prostheses. In this study, we conducted a review of patients with previously verified PJIs involving C. acnes in hip or shoulder prostheses, along with a genomic analysis of the bacteria causing the infections. The majority of patients had successful outcomes. We did not identify any specific phylogenetic lineage or specific molecular signature of virulence factors among these PJI-associated C. acnes isolates that seemed to be associated with increased potential to cause infection among this species. This indicates that C. acnes isolated from PJIs originates from the patients' own skin microbiome and is inoculated during the arthroplasty surgery.
