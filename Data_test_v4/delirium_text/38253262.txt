38253262|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD), a primary cause of dementia globally, is traditionally diagnosed via cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) measures and positron emission tomography (PET). The invasiveness, cost, and limited accessibility of these methods have led to exploring blood-based biomarkers as a promising alternative for AD diagnosis and monitoring. Recent advancements in sensitive immunoassays have identified potential blood-based biomarkers, such as Abeta42/Abeta40 ratios and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) species. This paper briefly evaluates the clinical utility and reliability of these biomarkers across various AD stages, highlighting challenges like refining plasma Abeta42/Abeta40 assays and enhancing the precision of p-tau, particularly p-tau181, p-tau217, and p-tau231. The discussion also covers other plasma biomarkers like neurofilament light (NfL), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and synaptic biomarkers, assessing their significance in AD diagnostics. The need for ongoing research and development of robust assays to match the performance of CSF and PET biomarkers is underscored. In summary, blood-based biomarkers are increasingly crucial in AD diagnosis, follow-up, prognostication, treatment response evaluation, and population screening, particularly in primary care settings. These developments are set to revolutionize AD diagnostics, offering earlier and more accessible detection and management options.
