38385622|a|AIMS: Disturbances in the circadian rhythm are positively correlated with the processes of aging and related neurodegenerative diseases, which are also associated with brain iron accumulation. However, the role of brain iron in regulating the biological rhythm is poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the impact of brain iron levels on the spontaneous locomotor activity of mice with altered brain iron levels and further explored the potential mechanisms governing these effects in vitro. RESULTS: Our results revealed that conditional knockout of ferroportin 1 (Fpn1) in cerebral microvascular endothelial cells led to brain iron deficiency, subsequently resulting in enhanced locomotor activity and increased expression of clock genes, including the circadian locomotor output cycles kaput protein (Clock) and brain and muscle ARNT-like 1 (Bmal1). Concomitantly, the levels of period circadian regulator 1 (PER1), which functions as a transcriptional repressor in regulating biological rhythm, were decreased. Conversely, the elevated brain iron levels in APP/PS1 mice inhibited autonomous rhythmic activity. Additionally, our findings demonstrate a significant decrease in serum melatonin levels in Fpn1cdh5 -CKO mice compared with the Fpn1flox/flox group. In contrast, APP/PS1 mice with brain iron deposition exhibited higher serum melatonin levels than the WT group. Furthermore, in the human glioma cell line, U251, we observed reduced PER1 expression upon iron limitation by deferoxamine (DFO; iron chelator) or endogenous overexpression of FPN1. When U251 cells were made iron-replete by supplementation with ferric ammonium citrate (FAC) or increased iron import through transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) overexpression, PER1 protein levels were increased. Additionally, we obtained similar results to U251 cells in mouse cerebellar astrocytes (MA-c), where we collected cells at different time points to investigate the rhythmic expression of core clock genes and the impact of DFO or FAC treatment on PER1 protein levels. CONCLUSION: These findings collectively suggest that altered iron levels influence the circadian rhythm by regulating PER1 expression and thereby modulating the molecular circadian clock. In conclusion, our study identifies the regulation of brain iron levels as a potential new target for treating age-related disruptions in the circadian rhythm.
