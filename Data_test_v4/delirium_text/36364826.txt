36364826|t|Diet in the Prevention of Alzheimer's Disease: Current Knowledge and Future Research Requirements.
36364826|a|Alzheimer's disease is a progressive brain disease that is becoming a major health problem in today's world due to the aging population. Despite it being widely known that diet has a significant impact on the prevention and progression of Alzheimer's disease, the literature data are still scarce and controversial. The application of the principles of rational nutrition for the elderly is suggested for Alzheimer's disease. The diet should be rich in neuroprotective nutrients, i.e., antioxidants, B vitamins, and polyunsaturated fatty acids. Some studies suggest that diets such as the Mediterranean diet, the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet, and the MIND (Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay) diet have a beneficial effect on the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease.
