36871334|a|Although poor sleep quality and extreme sleep durations have been associated with brain atrophy and dementia, it is unclear whether sleep disturbances contribute to neural injury in the absence of neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment. In 146 dementia-free older adults of the Rancho Bernardo Study of Healthy Aging (76.7 +- 7.8 years at MRI), we examined associations of restriction spectrum imaging metrics of brain microstructure with self-reported sleep quality 6.3 +- 0.7 years prior, and with sleep duration reported 25, 15 and 9 years prior. Worse sleep quality predicted lower white matter restricted isotropic diffusion and neurite density and higher amygdala free water, with stronger associations between poor sleep quality and abnormal microstructure for men. Among women only, short or long sleep duration 25 and 15 years before MRI predicted lower white matter restricted isotropic diffusion and increased free water. Associations persisted after accounting for associated health and lifestyle factors. Sleep patterns were not related to brain volume or cortical thickness. Optimizing sleep behaviors throughout the life-course may help to preserve healthy brain aging.
