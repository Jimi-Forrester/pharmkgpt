Since there were no data on the safety and tolerability of divalproex sodium in outpatients with dementia, we undertook a pilot study to inform the design of the ADCS study. METHODS: We recruited 20 outpatients with probable AD, MMSE 10-20, without history of agitation or psychosis. This was a 10-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study assessing the safety and tolerability of 1,000 mg/day and 1,500 mg/day of divalproex sodium delayed-release for 8 weeks followed by extended-release for 2 weeks. Other outcome measures addressed cognition, function, global status, side effects, and laboratory data. RESULTS: Participants assigned to active treatment ingested approximately 30% less of their prescribed study medication compared to those receiving placebo (p < .05 Wilcoxon Rank Sum test). The average tolerated dose for all participants at week 8 was 810 mg/day or 11.5 mg/kg/day, similar to the dose tolerated by nursing home patients. The most common side effects were sleepiness and tiredness, with worse cognitive performance in those assigned to 1500 mg/day. CONCLUSIONS: These results were used to design the multi-center ADCS trial. Doses of less than 1000 mg/day of divalproex sodium were the maximum tolerated by these outpatients with AD. A larger study of divalproex sodium dose tolerability is needed to define treatment in outpatients with Alzheimer's disease.
