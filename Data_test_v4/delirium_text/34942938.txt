34942938|a|Craniotomy involves procedures with high incidences of postoperative pain. Dexmedetomidine, a highly selective a2-adrenoreceptor agonist, has been shown to be beneficial in neuroanaesthesia. The purpose of this narrative review was to assess the effect and safety of dexmedetomidine given intraoperatively during anaesthesia compared to placebo and demonstrate the effect on acute postoperative pain in adult patients undergoing craniotomy. Literature published from 1996 until 2021 were analysed through a search of PubMed, Medline and Embase. Randomised controlled trials investigating intraoperative administration of Dexmedetomidine with evaluation of postoperative pain were included. Medical Subject Headings terms and free-text words were used to identify articles related to the intraoperative use of Dexmedetomidine and postcraniotomy pain. Thirteen distinct randomized controlled trials with 882 recruited patients undergoing craniotomy were identified as eligible for final inclusion. Intraoperative administration of dexmedetomidine is associated with decreased postoperative pain and opioid consumption, and it assures haemodynamic stability. Dexmedetomidine is an efficacious adjunct in craniotomy in adults, showing benefits in reduction of postoperative pain and analgesic consumption. Dexmedetomidine also offers haemodynamic stability. However, widespread methodological heterogeneity of the papers prohibits a valid meta-analysis.
