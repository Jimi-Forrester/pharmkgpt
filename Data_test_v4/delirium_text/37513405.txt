37513405|t|Potentiality Assessment of the Acetylcholinesterase-Inhibitory Activity of Olive Oil with an Additive Edible Insect Powder.
37513405|a|Edible insects (Alphitobius diaperinus Panzer, Gryllus campestris, Tenebrio molitor, Chorthippus biguttulus) are rich in nutrients that potentially inhibit acetylcholinesterase (AChE), but also improve cognition. The aim of this study was to evaluate four varied species of freeze-dried edible insects (purchased from a store); their nutrient composition, including fat, total phenolic compounds, vitamins, and antioxidant properties; and the potential inhibitory effect of AChE. An additional goal was to obtain olive oil with the addition of edible insects. Such oil was characterized by high oxidizing properties and showed high affinity to AChE. The results showed that mealworms and grasshoppers had the highest content of fats (PUFA/SFA) and phenolic compounds. These insects also showed a high content of vitamins, which correlated with the highest affinity for AChE. Therefore, they were added as a functional additive to olive oil. Olive oil with the addition of edible insects showed a higher affinity for AChE and enriched the olive oil with vitamin C and B vitamins.
