34070899|t|New and Innovative Treatments for Neovascular Age-Related Macular Degeneration (nAMD).
34070899|a|Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is one of the most common causes of vision loss. Advanced forms of AMD are seen in primarily two types-neovascular AMD (nAMD) with the presence of choroid neovascularization and non-neovascular AMD (nnAMD) with geographic atrophy. Neovascular AMD is characterized by choroidal neovascularization (CNV), which leads to a cascade of complications, including exudation, leakage, and ultimately fibrosis with photoreceptor loss. Inhibition of VEGF represents the current standard of care. However, there is a tremendous gap between the outcomes in randomized clinical trials and real-world settings. New agents for nAMD might offer the potential to improve treatment outcomes and reduce treatment of frequent intravitreal injections. We summarize all the newer molecules, their pivotal clinical trial results, and their unique mechanisms of action; these include longer-acting agents, combination strategies, sustained release, and genetic therapies.
