34881090|t|A Unique Type of Highly-Activated Microglia Evoking Brain Inflammation via Mif/Cd74 Signaling Axis in Aged Mice.
34881090|a|Senescence-associated alterations of microglia have only recently been appreciated in the aged brain. Although our previous study has reported chronic inflammation in aged microglia, the mechanism remains poorly understood. Here, we performed morphological detection and transcriptomic analysis of aged microglia at the single cell level. Aged mice showed a large quantity and a large body volume of microglia in the brain. Six subgroups of microglia with unique function were identified by single cell RNA sequencing. Three out of six subgroups showed dramatic variations in microglia between aged and young mice. A unique type of highly-activated microglia (HAM) was observed in aged mice only, with specific expression of several markers, including Lpl, Lgals3, Cst7, and Cd74. Gene clusters with functional implications in cell survival, energy metabolism, and immuno-inflammatory responses were markedly activated in HAM. Mechanistically, neuron-released Mif, acting through Cd74 receptor in HAM, promoted the immunochemotactic activity of microglia, which then triggered immuno-inflammatory responses in aged brains. These findings may reveal new targets for reducing age-related brain inflammation to maintain brain health.
