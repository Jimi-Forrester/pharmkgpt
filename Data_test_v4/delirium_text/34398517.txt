34398517|t|Enantioselective Total Synthesis of (+)-Garsubellin A.
34398517|a|Garsubellin A is a meroterpene capable of enhancing the enzyme choline acetyltransferase whose decreased level is believed to play a central role in the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. Due to the potentially useful biological activity together with the novel bridged and fused cyclic molecular architecture, garsubellin A has garnered substantial synthetic interest, but its absolute stereostructure has been undetermined. We report here the first enantioselective total synthesis of (+)-garsubellin A. Our synthesis relies on stereoselective fashioning of a cyclohexanone framework and double conjugate addition of 1,2-ethanedithiol that promotes aldol cyclization to build the bicyclic [3.3.1] skeleton. The twelve-step, protecting group-free synthetic route has enabled the syntheses of both the natural (-)-garsubellin A and its unnatural (+)-antipode for biological evaluations.
