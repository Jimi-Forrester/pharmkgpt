33318757|t|The role of palliative care in the management of patients with lung cancer.
33318757|a|Palliative care (PC) is the care of patients and their families with serious illness and is rapidly becoming an important part of the care of cancer patients. Patients with advanced lung cancer are a highly symptomatic population of patients and clearly experience benefits in quality of life and potentially benefits in overall survival when PC is incorporated early on after diagnosis. However, referrals to PC are still reliant on clinical judgment of patient prognosis and symptom burden. Moving forward, improving the integration of PC and lung cancer care will require more efficient real-time screening of patient symptoms, which may be accomplished through the use of patient-reported outcomes.
