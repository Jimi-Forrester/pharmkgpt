36695550|t|Inflammatory cell death: how macrophages sense neighbouring cell infection and damage.
36695550|a|Programmed cell death is a critical host defence strategy during viral infection. Neighbouring cells deal with this death in distinct ways depending on how the infected cell dies. While apoptosis is considered immunologically silent, the lytic pathways of necroptosis and pyroptosis trigger inflammatory responses by releasing inflammatory host molecules. All these pathways have been implicated in influenza A virus infection. Here, we review how cells sense neighbouring infection and death and how sensing shapes ensuing inflammatory responses.
