37253966|a|BACKGROUND: Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E)-based frozen section (FS) pathology is presently the global standard for intraoperative tumor assessment (ITA). Preparation of frozen section is labor intensive, which might consume up-to 30 minutes, and is susceptible to freezing artifacts. An FS-alternative technique is thus necessary, which is sectioning-free, artifact-free, fast, accurate, and reliably deployable without machine learning and/or additional interpretation training. METHODS: We develop a training-free true-H&E Rapid Fresh digital-Pathology (the-RFP) technique which is 4 times faster than the conventional preparation of frozen sections. The-RFP is assisted by a mesoscale Nonlinear Optical Gigascope (mNLOG) platform with a streamlined rapid artifact-compensated 2D large-field mosaic-stitching (rac2D-LMS) approach. A sub-6-minute True-H&E Rapid whole-mount-Soft-Tissue Staining (the-RSTS) protocol is introduced for soft/frangible fresh brain specimens. The mNLOG platform utilizes third harmonic generation (THG) and two-photon excitation fluorescence (TPEF) signals from H and E dyes, respectively, to yield the-RFP images. RESULTS: We demonstrate the-RFP technique on fresh excised human brain specimens. The-RFP enables optically-sectioned high-resolution 2D scanning and digital display of a 1 cm2 area in <120 seconds with 3.6 Gigapixels at a sustained effective throughput of >700 M bits/sec, with zero post-acquisition data/image processing. Training-free blind tests considering 50 normal and tumor-specific brain specimens obtained from 8 participants reveal 100% match to the respective formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE)-biopsy outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: We provide a digital ITA solution: the-RFP, which is potentially a fast and reliable alternative to FS-pathology. With H&E-compatibility, the-RFP eliminates color- and morphology-specific additional interpretation training for a pathologist, and the-RFP-assessed specimen can reliably undergo FFPE-biopsy confirmation.
