37487365|a|BACKGROUND: Cognitive-motor interference (CMI) is a common deficit in Alzheimer's (AD) disease and Parkinson's disease (PD) and may have utility in identification of prodromal neurodegeneration. There is lack of consensus regarding measurement of CMI resulting from dual task paradigms. RESEARCH QUESTION: How are individuals with AD, PD, and prodromal neurodegeneration impacted by CMI as measured by dual-task (DT) performance? METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed in six datasets using the PRISMA guidelines. Studies were included if they had samples of participants with AD, PD, or prodromal neurodegeneration and reported at least one measure of cognitive-motor DT performance. RESULTS: 4741 articles were screened and 95 included as part of this scoping review. Articles were divided into three non-mutually exclusive groups based on diagnoses, with 26 articles in AD, 56 articles in PD, and 29 articles in prodromal neurodegeneration, and results presented accordingly. SIGNIFICANCE: Individuals with AD and PD are both impacted by CMI, though the impact is likely different for each disease. We found a robust body of evidence regarding the utility of measures of DT performance in the detection of subtle deficits in prodromal AD and some signals of utility in prodromal PD. There are several key methodological challenges related to DT paradigms for the measurement of CMI in neurodegeneration. Overall, DT paradigms show good potential as a clinical method to probe specific brain regions, networks, and function; however, task selection and effect measurement should be carefully considered.
