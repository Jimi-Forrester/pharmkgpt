25080621|a|The word "psychosis", designing a group of worse psychical pathologies, has been progressively substituted, since 1850, to the word "madness" in the psychiatric literature. Without any consensus on a precise etiology of all kinds of psychosis, there is a large convergence on a clinical diagnostic with one main symptom: the loss of a sens of reality. This loss is supposed to derive from an alteration of the body diagram of the subject. This alteration implies the non-separation between the subject and the word, and then, a blockage of any authentic communication with the Other. Being so blocked, the temporal perception impeaches the fulfilling of the subjectivity's usual goals. The loss of reality could also induce a delirium, which tries to rebuild another kind of relation with the world. The issue about psychosis brings us to that ultimate question, so what we need to root the psychical distortion in the ordinary perceptive life, because our life is frequently inhabited by dreams, phantasms, and moreover hallucinations. Therefore, we need to examine and to question the meaning and the legitimacy of the strict boarder currently established beetween reason and insanity.
