39070648|a|Introduction: Dementia is one of the most pressing health concerns in ageing population, posing significant burdens not only on the well-being and independence of people with dementia (PWD), but also on their families and communities. Building capacity for nursing students is essential for effectively enhancing the quality of life for affected people. However, various studies have highlighted knowledge gaps concerning dementia among nursing students worldwide. This study aimed to examine knowledge and attitude preparedness for dementia care among nursing students in Vietnam and associated factors. Methods: We used cross-sectional study design with four medical schools in northern, central and southern Vietnam which were selected based on convenience. Participants included full-time diploma senior nursing students (N = 600). A self-administered questionnaire consisted of 34 true-false questions evaluating students' knowledge about dementia (ADKS) and 20 items using a 5-point Likert scale assessing their attitudes toward dementia (DAS). The tools were piloted and validated with 60 students with good internal reliability. Results: Nursing students exhibited insufficient knowledge of dementia but displayed positive attitudes towards dementia. Engaging four-year diploma (beta = 0.501), being female (beta = 0.827), and achieving greater academic performance (beta = 0.795) statistically influenced nursing students' knowledge of dementia (p < 0.05). Similarly, being female (beta = 2.179), and possessing better knowledge of dementia (beta = 2.740) statistically effected nursing students' attitude toward dementia (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Students with greater academic achievement and females demonstrated better knowledge and attitudes toward dementia. To better nursing students' preparedness for dementia care, education on dementia care, especially practical training should be paid more attention.
