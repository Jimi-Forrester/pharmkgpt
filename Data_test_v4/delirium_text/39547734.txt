39547734|t|ICU Delirium.
39547734|a|Delirium is not a harmless transient event during ICU hospitalization; rather, it is a severe complication of critical illness associated with increased mortality, morbidity, and persistent disability. Despite being recognized for decades, it remains underdiagnosed. Employing validated tools for detection helps reduce missed cases. Early detection facilitates prompt management. Sedatives, opioids, and antipsychotics should be avoided whenever possible. Optimizing environmental triggers, minimizing iatrogenicity, and treating underlying critical illness constitute the basis of the currently recommended approach to diminish the burden of delirium in ICU patients.
