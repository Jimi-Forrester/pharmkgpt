38560035|t|Utilization of RNA sequencing to investigate olfactory dysfunction in chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps: A pilot study.
38560035|a|Objectives: Prior research on olfactory dysfunction in chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) has focused on patients with polyps and suggests that direct inflammation of the olfactory cleft mucosa plays a contributory role. The purpose of this study was to evaluate gene expression in superior turbinate mucosal specimens, comparing normosmic and dysosmic CRS patients without polyps (CRSsNP). Methods: Tissue samples were obtained from the superior turbinates of patients with CRSsNP at the time of endoscopic sinus surgery. Samples subsequently underwent RNA sequencing and functional analysis to investigate biological pathways associated with differentially expressed genes between dysosmic (n = 7) and normosmic (n = 4) patients. Results: Differential gene expression analysis comparing dysosmic and normosmic CRSsNP patients showed upregulation of 563 genes and downregulation of 327 genes. Using stringent criteria for multiple comparisons, one upregulated gene (Immediate Early Response 3 [IER3]) had an false discovery rate (FDR) correction adjusted P value considered statistically significant (P < 0.001, fold change 2.69). Reactome functional analysis revealed eight biological pathways significantly different between dysosmic and normosmic patients (P < 0.05, FDR correction) including IL-4 and IL-13 signaling, IL-10 signaling, and rhodopsin-like receptors. Conclusions: RNA sequencing of the superior turbinates in patients with CRSsNP can provide valuable information regarding biological pathways and genes involved in olfactory dysfunction. This study supports literature suggesting that Type 2 inflammation may play a role in olfactory dysfunction in at least some patients with CRSsNP. This study also prompts questions regarding the role of IL-10, rhodopsin-like receptors, and IER3 in the pathogenesis of olfactory dysfunction.
