37887299|t|Epithelial Transport in Disease: An Overview of Pathophysiology and Treatment.
37887299|a|Epithelial transport is a multifaceted process crucial for maintaining normal physiological functions in the human body. This comprehensive review delves into the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying epithelial transport and its significance in disease pathogenesis. Beginning with an introduction to epithelial transport, it covers various forms, including ion, water, and nutrient transfer, followed by an exploration of the processes governing ion transport and hormonal regulation. The review then addresses genetic disorders, like cystic fibrosis and Bartter syndrome, that affect epithelial transport. Furthermore, it investigates the involvement of epithelial transport in the pathophysiology of conditions such as diarrhea, hypertension, and edema. Finally, the review analyzes the impact of renal disease on epithelial transport and highlights the potential for future research to uncover novel therapeutic interventions for conditions like cystic fibrosis, hypertension, and renal failure.
