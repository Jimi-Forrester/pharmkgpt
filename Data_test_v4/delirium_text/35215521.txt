35215521|t|Dietary Intervention Effectiveness, Clinical Outcomes and Nutrient and Salicylate Intakes in Older Adults Living in Long-Term Care Homes: The Results from the Senior's Plate Project.
35215521|a|Optimal nutrition is an important part of the therapeutic process offered to patients in long-term care, as it can significantly influence their nutritional and health status. The aim of this study was to assess the impacts of a dietary intervention on the nutritional status, clinical outcomes and selected nutrient and salicylate intakes among older adults living in a long-term care nursing home. To achieve the research goal, a prospective, non-randomized, baseline-controlled intervention study was conducted. The study was conducted within the framework of the "Senior's Plate Project", a project established in 2018 by the Polish Society of Dietetics. METHODS: A 3 month dietary intervention, which included one serving of supplementary food, served as a second breakfast (Nestle Sinlac). Energy, nutrients and salicylates intakes were estimated on the basis of the menus. Food and beverage intakes among residents were verified by health care personnel. Anthropometric measurements and clinical examinations were conducted according to standard procedures at baseline and after intervention. RESULTS: Of the 38 residents qualified for the study, 29 completed the program. Residents' body mass index (BMI) values ranged from 13.3 kg/m2 to 34 kg/m2. A BMI < 22 kg/m2, indicating underweight, was found in 19 subjects. The dietary intervention resulted in increased body weight (57.8 +- 12.3 vs. 59.4 +- 12.6 kg), BMI (22.4 +- 4.0 vs. 23.0 +- 4.1 kg/m2) and body fat (19.2 +- 8.7 vs. 20.6 +- 8.9 kg). Significant changes in the levels of biochemical parameters, including serum calcium (8.7 vs. 9.5 mg/dL), potassium (4.1 +- 0.6 vs. 4.5 +- 0.5 mmol/L) and zinc (74.1 +- 10.9 vs. 109.0 +- 20.4 microg/dL), were observed. Energy, protein, fat and carbohydrate intakes were significantly higher in the third month of the intervention as compared to the baseline. The estimated medial daily intake of salicylates was low and ranged from 0.34 mg to 0.39 mg. CONCLUSIONS: The dietary intervention resulted in beneficial and significant changes in the nutritional status, biochemical parameters and nutrition of residents of the long-term care home. These results suggest that practical and individualized approaches are required to improve the nutritional status and clinical outcomes of nursing homes residents.
