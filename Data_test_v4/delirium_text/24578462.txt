24578462|t|Screening for Mild Cognitive Impairment Using the Dementia Rating Scale-2.
24578462|a|This study examined the sensitivity and specificity of the Dementia Rating Scale-2 (DRS-2) to distinguish individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from both patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and healthy controls (HCs). A total of 50 HCs, 98 patients with MCI, and 49 patients with AD completed a neurological examination and battery of neuropsychological tests that included the DRS-2. Across almost all subscales of the DRS-2, patients with AD scored significantly worse than patients with MCI who in turn performed more poorly than the HCs. The only exception was the construction subscale where no significant difference was found between patients with MCI and the HCs. At a cutoff of 136, the sensitivity was 71% and specificity was 86% for distinguishing between patients with MCI and the HCs. Sensitivity was 82% and specificity was 78% for distinguishing between patients with MCI and patients with AD (cutoff score <124). For distinguishing between patients (with MCI and AD) and the HCs, sensitivity was 81% and specificity was 86% at a cutoff of 136. Our findings suggest the DRS-2 is a brief, easily administered cognitive test that appears to be useful in assisting with the detection of MCI.
