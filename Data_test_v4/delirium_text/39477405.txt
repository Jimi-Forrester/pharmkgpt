39477405|t|Bioinformatics Analysis and Experimental Validation of Epigallocatechin-3-gallate Against Iopromide-induced Injury in HEK-293 Cells via Anti-oxidative and Anti-inflammation Pathways.
39477405|a|BACKGROUND/AIM: The administration of contrast agents can adversely affect kidney function. Nevertheless, the nephrotoxicity of iopromide in human renal cells, potential therapeutic agents, and the underlying molecular mechanisms have not been thoroughly investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The proliferation of HEK-293 kidney cells was assessed using the 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazoliumbromide (MTT) assay. Apoptotic cell death was examined using the TUNEL assay and caspase-3 activity measurements. The impacts and potential pathways of epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) on iopromide-induced renal damage were analyzed through whole transcriptome sequencing. The redox state was assessed by measuring reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and 2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity. RESULTS: Iopromide-induced inhibition of cell proliferation and apoptosis in HEK-293 cells was counteracted by EGCG co-treatment. Pathway analysis revealed that molecules related to antioxidant and anti-inflammatory responses, such as ERK1/2, STAT1, and NF-[Formula: see text]B, were pivotal in the action of EGCG. CONCLUSION: Iopromide-induced ROS production, decreased DPPH scavenging ability, DNA strand breaks, elevated caspase-3 activity, and reduced cell proliferation were all reversed by EGCG co-treatment in HEK-293 cells. The mechanisms likely involve the attenuation of oxidative stress, inflammatory responses, and apoptosis, with regulation through the ERK1/2, STAT1, and NF-[Formula: see text]B pathways. Further research is necessary to confirm the protective effects of EGCG on renal function, particularly against damage induced by contrast agents like iopromide.
