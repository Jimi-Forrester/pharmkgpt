31309679|t|Activatable Small-Molecule Photoacoustic Probes that Cross the Blood-Brain Barrier for Visualization of Copper(II) in Mice with Alzheimer's Disease.
31309679|a|Copper enrichment in the brain is highly related to Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis, but in vivo tracing of Cu2+ in the brain by imaging techniques is still a great challenge. In this work, we developed a series of activatable photoacoustic (PA) probes with low molecular weights (less than 438 Da), RPS1-RPS4, which can specifically chelate with Cu2+ to form radicals with turn-on PA signals in the near-infrared (NIR) region. Introducing the electron-donating group N,N-dimethylaniline into the probe was found to significantly enhance the radical stability and PA intensity. The best probe in the series, RPS1, showed a fast response (within seconds) to Cu2+ with high selectivity and a low PA detection limit of 90.9 nm. Owing to the low molecular weight and amphiphilic structure, RPS1 could effectively cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and thus allowed us, for the first time, to visualize Cu2+ in vivo via PA imaging in the brains of AD mice.
