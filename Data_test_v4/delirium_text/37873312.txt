37873312|a|INTRODUCTION: Detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathophysiology among cognitively unimpaired individuals and those experiencing subjective cognitive decline (SCD) remains challenging. Plasma p-tau217 is one of the most promising of the emerging biomarkers for AD. However, accessible methods are limited. METHODS: We employed a novel p-tau217 immunoassay (UGOT p-tau217) in four independent cohorts (n=308) including a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker-classified cohort (Discovery), two cohorts consisting mostly of cognitively unimpaired participants (MYHAT and Pittsburgh), and a population-based cohort of individuals with SCD (beta-AARC). RESULTS: UGOT p-tau217 showed high accuracy (AUC= 0.80-0.91) identifying Abeta pathology, determined either by Abeta positron emission tomography or CSF Abeta42/40 ratio. In individuals experiencing SCD, UGOT p-tau217 showed high accuracy identifying those with a positive CSF Abeta42/40 ratio (AUC= 0.91). DISCUSSION: UGOT p-tau217 can be an easily accessible and efficient way to screen and monitor patients with suspected AD pathophysiology, even in the early stages of the continuum.
