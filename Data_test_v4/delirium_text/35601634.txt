35601634|t|A Comparison of Short-Term Outcomes between Laparoscopic and Open Liver Resection in Elderly Patients.
35601634|a|Purpose: The aim of this study was to compare the short-term outcomes between laparoscopic liver resection (LLR) and open liver resection (OLR) in elderly patients with hepatic tumors. Methods: From January 2013 to December 2019, a retrospective study was conducted for a total of 143 patients with over 70 years of age, who underwent liver resection for hepatic tumors. Forty-five patients who received biliary reconstruction at the same time were excluded. According to surgical approaches, 98 patients were classified into LLR and OLR groups. All postoperative complications were classified according to the Clavien-Dindo grading system and the Comprehensive Complication Index (CCI). Results: Incidence of the postoperative complications was not statistically different between LLR and OLR groups. The CCI was significantly lower in the LLR group, with a median of 8.556, and a median of 19.698 in the OLR group (p=0.042). The length of hospital stay in the LLR group was significantly shorter than in the OLR group (p=0.008). Conclusion: LLR is safe and feasible as a treatment for hepatic tumor in elderly patients with potentially less postoperative complications compared to OLR.
