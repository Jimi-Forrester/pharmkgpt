39369442|a|The progressive form of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurological condition marked by decline in older people's memory and cognition. Scopolamine is a behavioral technique that is frequently used to study cognitive disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease. This investigation aimed to determine the protective effects of ethanolic extracts derived from Sterculia guttata (ESG) on neurological & pathological changes induced by Scopolamine in rats with Alzheimer's. The ESG procured through a 48-hour hot maceration, followed by column chromatography, isolation and characterization using techniques such as FTIR, 1HNMR, 13CNMR and mass spectra. A flavonoid called Diosmin was identified in the extract. Rats were segregated into five groups: normal, scopolamine, scopolamine + Donepezil, scopolamine + ESG (200mg per kg orally), & scopolamine + ESG (400mg per kg orally) for a study of 14 day duration. Memory & learning abilities were assessed using the rectangular maze and Cook's pole climbing model. Additionally, biochemical parameters and brain histology were analyzed. ESG treatment mitigated scopolamine-induced changes in acetylcholinesterase, dopamine, serotonin, glutamate, and GABA levels, suggesting neuroprotection. These findings propose that ethanolic extracts of Sterculia guttata (ESG) show promise as effective preventive or therapeutic agents due to their potential for neuroprotection & cognitive enhancement in AD.
