32580525|t|DNA Hypermethylation and Unstable Repeat Diseases: A Paradigm of Transcriptional Silencing to Decipher the Basis of Pathogenic Mechanisms.
32580525|a|Unstable repeat disorders comprise a variable group of incurable human neurological and neuromuscular diseases caused by an increase in the copy number of tandem repeats located in various regions of their resident genes. It has become clear that dense DNA methylation in hyperexpanded non-coding repeats induces transcriptional silencing and, subsequently, insufficient protein synthesis. However, the ramifications of this paradigm reveal a far more profound role in disease pathogenesis. This review will summarize the significant progress made in a subset of non-coding repeat diseases demonstrating the role of dense landscapes of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) as a common disease modifier. However, the emerging findings suggest context-dependent models of 5mC-mediated silencing with distinct effects of excessive DNA methylation. An in-depth understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying this peculiar group of human diseases constitutes a prerequisite that could help to discover novel pathogenic repeat loci, as well as to determine potential therapeutic targets. In this regard, we report on a brief description of advanced strategies in DNA methylation profiling for the identification of unstable Guanine-Cytosine (GC)-rich regions and on promising examples of molecular targeted therapies for Fragile X disease (FXS) and Friedrich ataxia (FRDA) that could pave the way for the application of this technique in other hypermethylated expansion disorders.
