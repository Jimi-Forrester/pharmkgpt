8909427|a|Administering the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), we examined the behavioral symptoms of 22 patients with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), 50 patients with Alzheimer's disease, and 40 controls. PSP patients exhibited apathy (91%), disinhibition (36%), dysphoria (18%) and anxiety (18%), but rarely (< 9%) irritability, abnormal motor behaviors, or agitation. Apathy in PSP was significantly associated with executive dysfunction. The presence of high apathy and low agitation and anxiety scale scores correctly identified the PSP patients 85% of the time. Evaluating the behavioral abnormalities of patients with neurodegenerative disorders will aid diagnosis and facilitate management.
