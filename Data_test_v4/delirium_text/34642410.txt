34642410|t|Life expectancy of older people living in aged care facilities after a hip fracture.
34642410|a|To the authors' knowledge, no study has been conducted on life expectancy for aged care facility residents with hip fracture. We assessed life expectancy of 240 residents of aged care facilities in Australia who experienced recent hip fracture treated with surgery. 149 deaths occurred over a mean follow-up of 1.2 years. Being female and having better cognition were associated with longer life expectancy. Increased age was associated with shorter life expectancy. The cumulative mortality rate within three months after hip fracture was 25.0% while the cumulative mortality rate for the whole study period was 62.1%. Life expectancy was 8.2 years, 4.8 years and 2.8 years for 70, 80 and 90-years old female patients. Life expectancy was 3.8 years, 2.2 years and 1.3 years for 70, 80 and 90 years old male patients, respectively. In conclusion, age, gender and cognition level were associated with life expectancy of hip fracture patients living in aged care facilities and their life expectancy was much shorter than that of the general Australian population.
