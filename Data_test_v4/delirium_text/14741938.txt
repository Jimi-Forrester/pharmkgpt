14741938|a|OBJECTIVE: The main objective of the problem-based teaching unit reported in this paper was to introduce psychosocial and psychiatric concepts to first year medical students using an integrated approach. METHOD: A total of 131 undergraduate students studied a case of delirium. Students were encouraged to understand the problem from a number of perspectives and approaches. In particular, the patient's view was emphasised. This was partially achieved by employing a standardised patient, who answered students' questions about what it was like to be unwell and hospitalised. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluations of the teaching project were conducted. RESULTS: Overall, the teaching project was well received. However, as an introduction to a complex and unfamiliar area, students were concerned that material was difficult to grasp. CONCLUSIONS: As a foundation for future teaching in psychiatry, the case and our methods appear appropriate. However, this initial teaching should be reinforced and expanded upon in all years of the medical curriculum.
