29758938|a|BACKGROUND: Studies have shown the frequent coexistence of Lewy pathology (LP) in Alzheimer's Disease (AD). OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the influence of LP on the clinical and cognitive phenotype in a cohort of patients with a neuropathological diagnosis of AD. METHODS: We reviewed neuropathologically proven AD cases, reaching Braak stages V and VI in the brain banks of Lille and Paris between 1993 and 2016, and classified them according to LP extension (amygdala, brainstem, limbic, or neocortical). We then searched patient files for all available clinical and neuropsychiatric features and neuropsychological data. RESULTS: Thirty-three subjects were selected for this study, among which 16 were devoid of LP and 17 presented AD with concomitant LP. The latter were stratified into two subgroups according to LP distribution: 7 were AD with amygdala LP and 10 were AD with 'classical' (brainstem, limbic or neocortical) LP. When analyzing the incidence of each clinical feature at any point during the disease course, we found no significant difference in symptom frequency between the three groups. However, fluctuations appeared significantly earlier in patients with classical LP (2+-3.5 years) than in patients without LP (7+-1.7 years) or with amygdala LP (8+-2.8 years; p < 0.01). There was no significant difference in cognitive profiles. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the influence of LP on the clinical phenotype of AD is subtle. Core features of dementia with Lewy bodies do not allow clinical diagnosis of a concomitant LP on a patient-to-patient basis.
