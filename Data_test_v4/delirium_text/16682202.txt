16682202|t|3-Substituted gem-cyclohexane sulfone based gamma-secretase inhibitors for Alzheimer's disease: conformational analysis and biological activity.
16682202|a|Previously, chemistry effort on the gem-cyclohexane series of gamma-secretase inhibitors has focused on the 4-position of the cyclohexane ring. Recently chemistry has been directed towards the 3-position and substitution here has also provided compounds with high gamma-secretase activity.
