37856121|t|Visual Impairment Risk After Alcohol Abstinence in Patients With Newly Diagnosed Open-Angle Glaucoma.
37856121|a|Importance: Recent studies indicate that alcohol consumption is linked to increased intraocular pressure and higher prevalence of open-angle glaucoma (OAG). However, there is insufficient evidence to establish any correlation between alcohol abstinence and improved outcomes in patients with OAG. Objective: To evaluate the association between alcohol consumption status (and its changes) and risk of incident severe visual impairment (VI) or blindness in patients with newly diagnosed OAG. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective, nationwide, population-based cohort study used the Korean National Health Insurance Service's claims and health examination database to enroll patients who were newly diagnosed with OAG between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2011, and had been alcohol drinkers before their OAG diagnosis. The cohort was followed up until December 2020. The data were analyzed from February to December 2022. Exposures: The patients were categorized into 2 groups based on their post-OAG diagnosis alcohol consumption status: sustainers and abstainers. The risks of severe VI or blindness were compared using weighted Cox proportional hazards regression models along with inverse probability of treatment weighting. Main Outcomes and Measures: Incident severe VI or blindness. Results: Among 13 643 patients with newly diagnosed OAG (mean [SD] age, 53.7 [11.9] years; 12 066 men [88.4%]) who were drinkers, 2866 (21.0%) quit drinking after the diagnosis. During 91 366 person-years of follow-up, patients abstaining from alcohol after their OAG diagnosis had a lower risk of severe VI or blindness than did those who had sustained drinking (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR] after inverse probability of treatment weighting, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.45-0.87). Among the sustained drinkers, both mild consumption (<105 g/wk; AHR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.01-2.28) and moderate to heavy consumption (>=105 g/wk; AHR, 1.78; 95% CI, 1.11-2.86) after OAG diagnosis were associated with higher risk of severe VI or blindness relative to abstainers. Frequent drinking (>=4 d/wk) also was associated with a higher risk of severe VI or blindness (AHR, 2.56; 95% CI, 1.52-4.33) compared with abstinence. Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study of patients with OAG who were drinkers, abstaining from alcohol after an OAG diagnosis was associated with lower risk of severe VI or blindness. These findings suggest that lifestyle interventions, such as alcohol abstinence, could be essential for patients with newly diagnosed OAG.
