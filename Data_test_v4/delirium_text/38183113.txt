38183113|a|BACKGROUND: Numerous studies have demonstrated the impact of beverage consumption on overall health and oral health. Specifically, high consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages and coffee has been associated with an increased risk of metabolic disorders and periodontitis. Conversely, high intake of plain water has been linked to various health benefits, including weight management and reduced energy intake. However, no previous studies have explored the potential association between plain water intake and the risk of periodontitis. OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to investigate the relationship between plain water consumption and periodontitis in a middle-aged and elderly population. METHODS: The present cross-sectional study was conducted among participants aged >= 45 in the 2009-2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys. Multivariable regression analysis, subgroup analysis and smooth fitting tests were conducted to explore the independent relationship between plain water intake and periodontitis. RESULTS: A total of 5,882 participants were enrolled,62.02% have periodontitis. Periodontitis patients have lower plain water intake. The multivariable regression tests showed that the risk of periodontitis decreased with increased plain water intake quartiles (Q4 OR = 0.78; 95%CI 0.62-0.96) after fully adjustment. Subgroup analysis and interaction tests showed that gender, age, smoking, diabetes, hypertension or BMI does not significantly interact with the association. However, the relation was significant in males (Q4 OR = 0.64; 95%CI 0.47-0.86) but not in females (Q4 OR = 0.97;95% CI 0.71-1.31). In the smoothed curve fits stratified by gender, the curve for male participants displayed as a U-shape, with an optimal plain water intake at 1200 ml/day. For males drinking plain water less than 1200 ml/day, the risk of periodontitis decreased by 24% with each increase of 500 ml plain water intake (OR = 0.76, 95%CI 0.66-0.87, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Together, the results showed that plain water intake is negatively associated with periodontitis risk in US middle aged and elderly population. Further studies are needed to investigate the mechanism unites this association. Attention should be given to adequate plain water intake when considering dietary suggestions to the population at high risk of developing periodontitis, especially for men.
