Individuals vary in their capacity to tolerate episodes of extreme heat. Because skin is the organ tasked with heat dissipation, it is important for dermatologists to be versed in the physiology of cutaneous heat dissipation and cognizant of clinical settings in which the skin's thermoregulatory responses may be impaired. When the external temperature is lower than that of the skin, the skin releases internal heat through direct thermal exchange with the environment, a process that is aided by an expansion of cutaneous blood flow and eccrine sweating. Cooling through the evaporation of sweat is effective even when the external temperature exceeds that of skin. Many factors, including environmental and physiological (e.g., age and sex), and pathological (e.g., preexisting illnesses, disorders of eccrine function, and medications) considerations, affect the skin's capacity to thermoregulate. Identification of individuals at increased risk for heat-related morbidity and mortality will become increasingly important in the care of patients.
