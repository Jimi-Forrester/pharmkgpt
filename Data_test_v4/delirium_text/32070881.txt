32070881|t|Redox-dependent regulation of mitochondrial dynamics by DJ-1 paralogs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
32070881|a|Mitochondria are indispensable organelles that perform critical cellular functions, including energy metabolism, neurotransmission, and synaptic maintenance. Mitochondrial dysfunction and impairment in the organellar homeostasis are key hallmarks implicated in the progression of neurodegenerative disorders. The members of DJ-1/ThiJ/PfpI family are highly conserved, and loss of DJ-1 (PARK7) function in humans results in the impairment of mitochondrial homeostasis, which is one of the key cellular etiology implicated in the progression of Parkinson's Disease. However, the underlying molecular mechanism involved in mitochondrial maintenance and other cellular processes by DJ-1 paralogs is poorly understood. By utilizing genetic approaches from S. cerevisiae, we uncovered intricate mechanisms associated with the mitochondrial phenotypic variations regulated by DJ-1 paralogs. The deletion of DJ-1 paralogs led to respiratory incompetence and the accumulation of enhanced functional mitochondrial mass. The lack of DJ-1 paralogs also displayed enriched mitochondrial interconnectivity due to upregulation in the fusion-mediating proteins, facilitated by the elevation in the basal cellular ROS and oxidized glutathione levels. Intriguingly, these mitochondrial phenotypes variations cause cell size abnormalities, partially suppressed by reestablishing redox balance and upregulation of fission protein levels. Besides, in the absence of DJ-1 paralogs, cells exhibited a significant delay in the cell-cycle progression in the G2/M phase, attributed to mitochondrial hyperfusion and partial DNA damage. Additionally, the aberrations in mitochondrial dynamics and cell-cycle induce cell death mediated by apoptosis. Taken together, our findings first-time provide evidence to show how DJ-1 family members regulate mitochondrial homeostasis and other intricate cellular processes, including cell cycle and apoptosis.
