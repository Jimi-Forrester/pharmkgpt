36289077|t|Neutrophils as emerging protagonists and targets in chronic inflammatory diseases.
36289077|a|INTRODUCTION: Neutrophils are the key cells of our innate immune system with a primary role in host defense. They rapidly arrive at the site of infection and display a range of effector functions including phagocytosis, degranulation, and NETosis to eliminate the invading pathogens. However, in recent years, studies focusing on neutrophil biology have revealed the highly adaptable nature and versatile functions of these cells which extend beyond host defense. Neutrophils are now referred to as powerful mediators of chronic inflammation. In several chronic inflammatory diseases, their untoward actions, such as immense infiltration, hyper-activation, dysregulation of effector functions, and extended survival, eventually contribute to disease pathogenesis. Therefore, a better understanding of neutrophils and their effector functions in prevalent chronic diseases will not only shed light on their role in disease pathogenesis but will also reveal them as novel therapeutic targets. METHODS: We performed a computer-based online search using the databases, PubMed.gov and Clinical trials.gov for published research and review articles. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: This review provides an assessment of neutrophils and their crucial involvement in various chronic inflammatory disorders ranging from respiratory, neurodegenerative, autoimmune, and cardiovascular diseases. In addition, we also discuss the therapeutic approach for targeting neutrophils in disease settings that will pave the way forward for future research.
