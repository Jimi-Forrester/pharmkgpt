26092575|t|Emerging Role of Melatonin and Melatonin Receptor Agonists in Sleep and Delirium in Intensive Care Unit Patients.
26092575|a|Delirium, an acute state of mental confusion, can lead to many adverse sequelae in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Although the etiology of ICU delirium is often multifactorial, and at times not fully understood, sleep deprivation is considered to be a major contributing factor to its development. It has been postulated that administration of exogenous melatonin and melatonin receptor agonists such as ramelteon may prevent delirium by promoting nocturnal sleep in ICU patients. The purpose of this review is to summarize the pharmacology of melatonin and melatonin receptor agonists and investigate their potential roles in sleep promotion and delirium prevention in ICU patients. Although few studies evaluating the impact of melatonergic agents on sleep and delirium in the ICU have been completed, some data suggest their potential positive effects on sleep and delirium. However, large-scale randomized controlled trials are warranted to determine the optimal role of melatonergic agents in the prevention of ICU delirium.
