17565502|a|Three synchronization measures are applied to scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) data collected from 20 patients diagnosed to have either: (1) no dementia, (2) mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or (3) Alzheimer's disease (AD). We apply the three synchronization measures--the phase synchronization, and two measures of nonlinear interdependency--to the data collected from awake patients resting with eyes closed. We show that the synchronization in potential between electrodes near the left and right occipital lobes provides a statistically significant discriminant between the healthy and AD subjects, and the MCI and AD subjects. None of the three measures appears able to distinguish between the healthy and MCI subjects, although MCI subjects show synchronization values intermediate between healthy subjects (with high synchronization values) and AD subjects (with low synchronization values) on average.
