29478325|t|Carcinogenesis and Reactive Oxygen Species Signaling: Interaction of the NADPH Oxidase NOX1-5 and Superoxide Dismutase 1-3 Signal Transduction Pathways.
29478325|a|SIGNIFICANCE: Reduction/oxidation (redox) balance could be defined as an even distribution of reduction and oxidation complementary processes and their reaction end products. There is a consensus that aberrant levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), commonly observed in cancer, stimulate primary cell immortalization and progression of carcinogenesis. However, the mechanism how different ROS regulate redox balance is not completely understood. Recent Advances: In the current review, we have summarized the main signaling cascades inducing NADPH oxidase NOX1-5 and superoxide dismutase (SOD) 1-3 expression and their connection to cell proliferation, immortalization, transformation, and CD34+ cell differentiation in thyroid, colon, lung, breast, and hematological cancers. CRITICAL ISSUES: Interestingly, many of the signaling pathways activating redox enzymes or mediating the effect of ROS are common, such as pathways initiated from G protein-coupled receptors and tyrosine kinase receptors involving protein kinase A, phospholipase C, calcium, and small GTPase signaling molecules. FUTURE DIRECTIONS: The clarification of interaction of signal transduction pathways could explain how cells regulate redox balance and may even provide means to inhibit the accumulation of harmful levels of ROS in human pathologies.
