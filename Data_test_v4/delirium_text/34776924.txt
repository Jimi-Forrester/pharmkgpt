34776924|t|Serum miR-214 Serves as a Biomarker for Prodromal Parkinson's Disease.
34776924|a|Circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) have been proposed to be accessible biomarkers for Parkinson's disease (PD). However, there is a lack of known miRNAs that can serve as biomarkers for prodromal PD (pPD). We previously identified that miR-31 and miR-214 were dysregulated in PD. The aim of this study was to explore the roles of miR-31 and miR-214 in pPD. We recruited 25 pPD patients, 20 patients with de novo PD (dnPD), 24 advanced PD (aPD) patients and 21 controls. Next, we investigated the expression of miR-31 and miR-214. Compared to controls, miR-214 was found to be significantly upregulated in pPD patients while miR-31 was significantly upregulated in aPD patients. In addition, the expression of miR-214 was lower in aPD patients compared to both dnPD or pPD patients, while the expression of miR-31 was higher in aPD patients compared to dnPD patients. In order to predict pPD via miRNA expression, the receiver operating characteristic curve was constructed and the area under curve (AUC) was calculated. For pPD prediction by miR-214, the AUC was 0.756. The optimal cut-off value of miR-214 was 0.1962, and the sensitivity and specificity were 72.0% and 76.2%, respectively. On the other hand, the AUC for aPD detection by miR-31 was 0.744. The optimal cut-off value for miR-31 was 0.0148, with a sensitivity of 87.5% and a specificity of 71.4%. In conclusion, miR-214 can distinguish pPD patients from controls and may be used as a potential biomarker for pPD diagnosis.
