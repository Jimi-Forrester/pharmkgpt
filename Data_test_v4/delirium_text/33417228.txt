33417228|t|Modified Snake alpha-Neurotoxin Averts beta-Amyloid Binding to alpha7 Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor and Reverses Cognitive Deficits in Alzheimer's Disease Mice.
33417228|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of senile dementia and one of the greatest medical, social, and economic challenges. According to a dominant theory, amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide is a key AD pathogenic factor. Abeta-soluble species interfere with synaptic functions, aggregate gradually, form plaques, and trigger neurodegeneration. The AD-associated pathology affects numerous systems, though the substantial loss of cholinergic neurons and alpha7 nicotinic receptors (alpha7AChR) is critical for the gradual cognitive decline. Abeta binds to alpha7AChR under various experimental settings; nevertheless, the functional significance of this interaction is ambiguous. Whereas the capability of low Abeta concentrations to activate alpha7AChR is functionally beneficial, extensive brain exposure to high Abeta concentrations diminishes alpha7AChR activity, contributes to the cholinergic deficits that characterize AD. Abeta and snake alpha-neurotoxins competitively bind to alpha7AChR. Accordingly, we designed a chemically modified alpha-cobratoxin (mToxin) to inhibit the interaction between Abeta and alpha7AChR. Subsequently, we examined mToxin in a set of original in silico, in vitro, ex vivo experiments, and in a murine AD model. We report that mToxin reversibly inhibits alpha7AChR, though it attenuates Abeta-induced synaptic transmission abnormalities, and upregulates pathways supporting long-term potentiation and reducing apoptosis. Remarkably, mToxin demonstrates no toxicity in brain slices and mice. Moreover, its chronic intracerebroventricular administration improves memory in AD-model animals. Our results point to unique mToxin neuroprotective properties, which might be tailored for the treatment of AD. Our methodology bridges the gaps in understanding Abeta-alpha7AChR interaction and represents a promising direction for further investigations and clinical development.
