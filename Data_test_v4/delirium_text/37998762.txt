37998762|t|Adverse Events Associated with Prolonged Antibiotic Therapy for Periprosthetic Joint Infections-A Prospective Study with a Special Focus on Rifampin.
37998762|a|Periprosthetic Joint Infection (PJI) is a significant contributor to patient morbidity and mortality, and it can be addressed through a range of surgical interventions coupled with antibiotic therapies. Following surgical intervention(s), prolonged administration of oral antibiotics is recommended to cure PJI. There is a lack of reports on the adverse events (AEs) associated with oral antibiotics, particularly rifampin. This investigation sought to elucidate the occurrence of antibiotic-related AEs after an initial regimen of intravenous antibiotic administration, supplemented by an extended course of oral antibiotics. A prospective study of patients diagnosed with PJI of the hip, knee, or shoulder who underwent single-stage exchange arthroplasty (SSE) (10%), two-stage exchange arthroplasty (TSE) (81%), or debridement, antibiotics, and implant retention (DAIR) (6%) was performed. The primary outcome of interest was the detection of AEs, the secondary outcome the detection of a correlation between rifampin use and the incidence of AEs, and the tertiary outcome was whether oral antibiotic treatment needed to be adjusted or discontinued due to AEs. In addition, subjective tolerability was monitored throughout the study. A total of 336 events were identified for 73 out of 80 patients. The most frequently used antibiotics were rifampin and co-trimoxazole. Most AEs occurred in the gastrointestinal tract (46%). The most frequent AEs were nausea, inappetence, diarrhea, and skin rash. In 6% of cases, the AEs led to antibiotic discontinuation, and in 29% of cases, a dose adjustment of the oral therapy occurred, mainly with amoxicillin or co-trimoxazole. The majority of patients (55%) rated the subjective tolerability as good. In conclusion, AEs during antibiotic treatment for PJI are common. They mainly affect the gastrointestinal tract. Rifampin use might be a reason for the higher incidence of AEs compared to non-rifampin antibiotic treatment.
