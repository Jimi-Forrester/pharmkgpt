36316858|t|Prophylactic melatonin for delirium in critically ill patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis with trial sequential analysis.
36316858|a|BACKGROUND: Up to 80% of patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) suffer from delirium. Studies on the preventative use of melatonin in the ICU have produced mixed results. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate whether early administration of melatonin reduces the prevalence of delirium in critically ill patients. METHODS: We searched Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Library for randomized controlled trials comparing melatonin or melatonin agonists to placebo in ICU setting. The population included adult patients in the ICU. The primary outcome was the prevalence of delirium. Secondary outcomes included duration of delirium, delirium-free day, serum melatonin concentration, need for sedation, duration of mechanical ventilation, hospital and ICU length of stay (LOS), all-cause mortality, sleep quality, and adverse events. Trial sequential analysis (TSA) was performed on the primary outcome to prevent the risk of random error and multiplicity phenomenon as a result of repeated significance testing across all the included trials. RESULTS: Twelve trials with a total of 2538 patients were analyzed. When all trials were pooled, the incidence of delirium in ICU patients who received melatonin was significantly lower than in those who received placebo (risk ratio, 0.77; 95% confidence interval: 0.61-0.96; I2 = 56%). There were no significant differences in secondary outcomes including duration of delirium, duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU LOS, hospital LOS, and mortality. TSA indicated that Z-curve crossed the traditional boundary, but did not cross the monitoring boundary for benefit, which indicated that it is still inconclusive that melatonin affects the incidence of delirium. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis found that early administration of melatonin may result in a decreased delirium prevalence in critically ill patients. However, the sensitivity analysis of high-quality studies did not support this finding. In addition, TSA demonstrated that the result may have false-positive error. Therefore, this finding should be interpreted with caution. Further studies are needed to examine the effectiveness of prophylactic melatonin on the prevalence and duration of ICU delirium in the future.
