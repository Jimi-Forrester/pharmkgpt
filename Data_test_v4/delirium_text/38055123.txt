38055123|t|Preoperative nutritional optimization for adult spinal deformity: Review.
38055123|a|PURPOSE: The main objective of this review article is to examine the role that nutrition has on adult spinal deformity. The information presented in this review aims to provide spine surgeons with a broad overview of screening, assessment, and interventional strategies that may be used for presurgical nutritional optimization. METHODS: A comprehensive literature review utilizing three biomedical databases was performed to generate articles of interest. Published articles related to nutrition, adult spinal deformity, spine surgery and orthopaedics were reviewed for the composition of this article. Nutrition may play a role in optimizing postoperative outcomes following adult spinal deformity surgeries, such as limiting delirium, length of stay, blood transfusion, and other medical complications. The use of screening tools, such as the PNI and CONUT score can assess preoperative nutritional status and may provide some utility in evaluating nutrition status in patients undergoing deformity surgery. Balancing both macronutrients and micronutrients, notably, carbohydrates, protein, albumin, and vitamin D can play a role in preoperative optimization. CONCLUSION: Adult spinal deformity patients are at an increased risk for malnutrition. These patients should be assessed for nutrition status to prime them for surgery, minimize complications, and maximize their outcomes. However, further studies are needed to determine how nutrition ultimately affects adult spinal deformity patients in the postoperative period and to establish specific nutritional recommendations for this unique population.
