38254589|t|A Review of the Pro-Health Activity of Asparagus officinalis L. and Its Components.
38254589|a|The genus Asparagus comprises about 300 species, including A. curilus, A. filicinus, A. reacemosus, and A. officinalis L. A particularly well-known member of the genus is Asparagus officinalis L., also known as "the king of vegetables". Consuming A. officinalis makes an excellent contribution to a healthy diet. Modern studies have shown it to have a diuretic effect and promote defecation; it also demonstrates high levels of basic nutrients, including vitamins, amino acids and mineral salts. Moreover, it is rich in fiber. Asparagus contains large amounts of folic acid (10 cooked shoots provide 225 micrograms, or almost 50% of the daily requirement) and vitamin C (10 cooked shoots provide 25 mg). The present review describes the current literature concerning the pro-health properties of various parts of A. officinalis L., with a particular focus on its spears. It is based on studies identified in electronic databases, including PubMed, ScienceDirect, Web of Knowledge, Sci Finder, Web of Science, and SCOPUS. The data indicate that the various parts of A. officinalis, especially the spears, contain many bioactive compounds. However, although the extracts and chemical compounds isolated from A. officinalis, especially saponins, appear to have various biological properties and pro-health potential, these observations are limited to in vitro and animal in vivo models.
