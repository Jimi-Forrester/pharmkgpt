36708440|t|Associations of an eye-tracking task and pupillary metrics with age and ASA physical status score in a preoperative cohort.
36708440|a|Advanced age, American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status (ASA) classification and the presence of cognitive impairment are associated with an elevated risk of postoperative morbidity and mortality. The visual paired comparison (VPC) task, which relies on recognition of novel images, examines declarative memory. VPC scores have demonstrated the ability to detect mild cognitive impairment and track progression of neurodegenerative disease. Quantitative pupillometry may have similar value. We evaluate for associations between these variables of interest and the feasibility of performing these tests in the preoperative clinic. Prospective data from 199 patients seen in the preoperative clinic at a tertiary academic center were analyzed. A 5 min VPC task (Neurotrack Technologies, Inc, Redwood City, CA) was administered during their scheduled preoperative clinic visit. Pupillary light reflexes were measured at the same visit (PLR-3000 , Neuroptics Corp, Irvine, California).Thirty-four percent of patients were categorized as ASA 2 and 58% as ASA 3. Median age was 57 (IQR: 44-69). Associations were demonstrated between age and ASA physical status (Mann-Whitney U Test, p < 0.0001), maximum pupil size (Spearman Rank Correlation, r = - 0.40, p < 0.0001), and maximum constriction velocity (Spearman Rank Correlation, r = - 0.39, p < 0.0001). Our data also revealed an association between VPC score and age (Spearman Rank Correlation, p = 0.0016, r = - 0.21) but not ASA score (Kruskal-Wallis Test, p = 0.14). When compared to a nonsurgical cohort with no history of memory impairment, our population scored worse on the VPC task (Mann-Whitney U Test, p = 0.0002). A preoperative 5 min VPC task and pupillometry are feasible tests in the preoperative setting and may provide a valuable window into an individual's cognition prior to elective surgery.
