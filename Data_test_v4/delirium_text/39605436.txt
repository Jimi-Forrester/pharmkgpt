39605436|t|Identifying Alzheimer's disease-associated genes using PhenoGeneRanker.
39605436|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurogenerative disease that affects millions worldwide with no effective treatment. Several studies have been conducted to decipher to genomic underpinnings of AD. Due to its complex nature, many genes have been found to be associated with AD. Despite these findings, the pathophysiology of the disease is still elusive. To discover new putative AD-associated genes, in this study, we integrated multimodal gene and phenotype datasets of AD using network biology methods to prioritize potential AD-related genes. We constructed a multiplex heterogeneous network composed of patient and gene similarity networks utilizing phenotypic and omics datasets of AD patients from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. We applied PhenoGeneRanker to traverse this network to discover potential AD-associated genes. To assess the impact of each network layer and seed gene, we also run PhenoGeneRanker on different variants of the network and seed genes. Our results showed that top-ranked genes captured several known AD-related genes and were enriched in Gene Ontology (GO) terms related to AD. We also observed that several top-ranked genes that are not in AD-associated gene list had literature supporting their potential relevance to AD.
