34822523|t|Retinaldehyde Dehydrogenase Inhibition-Related Adverse Outcome Pathway: Potential Risk of Retinoic Acid Synthesis Inhibition during Embryogenesis.
34822523|a|Retinoic acid (RA) is one of the factors crucial for cell growth, differentiation, and embryogenesis; it interacts with the retinoic acid receptor and retinoic acid X receptor to eventually regulate target gene expression in chordates. RA is transformed from retinaldehyde via oxidization by retinaldehyde dehydrogenase (RALDH), which belongs to the family of oxidoreductases. Several chemicals, including disulphiram, diethylaminobenzaldehyde, and SB-210661, can effectively inhibit RALDH activity, potentially causing reproductive and developmental toxicity. The modes of action can be sequentially explained based on the molecular initiating event toward key events, and finally the adverse outcomes. Adverse outcome pathway (AOP) is a conceptual and theoretical framework that describes the sequential chain of casually liked events at different biological levels from molecular events to adverse effects. In the present review, we discussed a recently registered AOP (AOP297; inhibition of retinaldehyde dehydrogenase leads to population decline) to explain and support the weight of evidence for RALDH inhibition-related developmental toxicity using the existing knowledge.
