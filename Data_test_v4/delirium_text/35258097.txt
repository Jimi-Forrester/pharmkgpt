35258097|a|Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the most concerning health issues in which the normal brain function may be disrupted as a result of a blow, bump, or jolt to the head. Loss of consciousness, amnesia, focal neurological defects, alteration in mental state, and destructive diseases of the nervous system such as cognitive impairment, Parkinson's, and Alzheimer's disease. Parkinson's disease is a chronic progressive neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by the early loss of striatal dopaminergic neurons. TBI is a major risk factor for Parkinson's disease. Existing therapeutic approaches have not been often effective, indicating the necessity of discovering more efficient therapeutic targets. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway responds to different environmental cues to modulate a large number of cellular processes such as cell proliferation, survival, protein synthesis, autophagy, and cell metabolism. Moreover, mTOR has been reported to affect the regeneration of the injured nerves throughout the central nervous system (CNS). In this context, recent evaluations have revealed that mTOR inhibitors could be potential targets to defeat a group of neurological disorders, and thus, a number of clinical trials are investigating their efficacy in treating dementia, autism, epilepsy, stroke, and brain injury, as irritating neurological defects. The current review describes the interplay between mTOR signaling and major CNS-related disorders (esp. neurodegenerative diseases), as well as the mTOR signaling-TBI relationship. It also aims to discuss the promising therapeutic capacities of mTOR inhibitors during the TBI.
