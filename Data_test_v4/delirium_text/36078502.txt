36078502|t|Falls at the Geriatric Hospital Ward in the Context of Risk Factors of Falling Detected in a Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment.
36078502|a|It is only by knowing the most common causes of falls in the hospital that appropriate and targeted fall prevention measures can be implemented. This study aimed to assess the frequency of falls in a hospital geriatrics ward and the circumstances in which they occurred and evaluate the parameters of the comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) correlating with falls. We considered medical, functional, and nutritional factors associated with falls and built multivariable logistic regression analysis models. A total of 416 (median age 82 (IQR 77-86) years, 77.4% women) hospitalizations in the geriatrics ward were analyzed within 8 months. We compared the results of a CGA (including health, psycho-physical abilities, nutritional status, risk of falls, frailty syndrome, etc.) in patients who fell and did not fall. Fourteen falls (3.3% of patients) were registered; the rate was 4.4 falls per 1000 patient days. They most often occurred in the patient's room while changing position. Falls happened more frequently among people who were more disabled, had multimorbidity, were taking more medications (certain classes of drugs in particular), had Parkinson's disease and diabetes, reported falls in the last year, and were diagnosed with orthostatic hypotension. Logistic regression determined the significant independent association between in-hospital falls and a history of falls in the previous 12 months, orthostatic hypotension, Parkinson's disease, and taking statins, benzodiazepines, and insulin. Analysis of the registered falls that occurred in the hospital ward allowed for an analysis of the circumstances in which they occurred and helped to identify people at high risk of falling in a hospital, which can guide appropriate intervention and act as an indicator of good hospital care.
