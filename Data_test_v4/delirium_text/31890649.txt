31890649|a|BACKGROUND: Intravascular large B-cell lymphoma (IVLBCL) is a rare and aggressive subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma with a varied presentation and no pathognomonic findings. Early diagnosis is critical to altering the disease course as early treatment with chemoimmunotherapy is required to prevent a rapidly fatal outcome. Strategies including improved awareness of this clinical entity through publication of cases with unique presentations are essential to prompt consideration of IVLBCL early in the disease workup. Here, we present a case of IVLBCL presenting with altered mental status and systemic organ dysfunction. CASE SUMMARY: A 61-year-old male patient presented with flu-like symptoms and a high fever. He experienced rapid clinical deterioration with liver, kidney failure, and shock despite rapid antibiotic administration and supportive care. A broad infectious workup was negative. Intracranial imaging revealed nonspecific changes to the corpus callosum suspicious for vasculitis. Renal biopsy was non-diagnostic. After further progression of his symptoms, the family elected to withdraw care and the patient died shortly thereafter. Post-mortem analysis revealed clear multi-organ involvement by IVLBCL, prompting re-examination of the ante-mortem renal biopsy that also identified IVLBCL involvement. CONCLUSION: IVLBCL is a rare disease. Communication with specialties and early biopsy is critical to establishing the diagnosis and initiating therapy.
