31669201|a|The present study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of fenofibrate and pioglitazone in a mouse model of amyloidogenesis induced by amyloidbeta (betaA) peptide. Mice were injected intracerebroventricularly with betaA1-40 (400 pmol/mouse) once, followed by treatment with fenofibrate (300 mg/kg), pioglitazone (30 mg/kg),or both. After 21 days of daily treatment, memory impairment and cognitive function were evaluated by Morris water maze (MWM), Y-maze and object recognition tests. On the 22nd day, mice were sacrificed, and their hippocampi were dissected to determine the levels of alpha- and beta-secretase, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPARalpha and beta), Wnt and beta-catenin. Significant memory impairment and cognitive dysfunction were observed in the mouse model group. This finding was associated with a significant increase in alpha- and beta-secretase levels and a significant decrease in Wnt, beta-catenin, and PPARalpha and beta levels. Neuronal damage was also evident after histopathological examination. Treatment with fenofibrate, pioglitazone and their combination resulted in a significant improvement in the behavioural and neurochemical changes induced by betaA injection. The present findings indicate that the combined administration of fenofibrate and pioglitazone was more effective than monotherapy in ameliorating the behavioural, neurochemical and histopathological changes in amyloidogenesis model mice and provide a promising therapeutic approach in the management of Alzheimer's disease complicated by diabetes and hypercholesterolemia.
