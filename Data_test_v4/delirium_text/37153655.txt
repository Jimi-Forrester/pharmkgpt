37153655|a|Given the complexity of cerebral pathology in patients with acute brain injury, various neuromonitoring strategies have been developed to better appreciate physiologic relationships and potentially harmful derangements. There is ample evidence that bundling several neuromonitoring devices, termed "multimodal monitoring," is more beneficial compared to monitoring individual parameters as each may capture different and complementary aspects of cerebral physiology to provide a comprehensive picture that can help guide management. Furthermore, each modality has specific strengths and limitations that depend largely on spatiotemporal characteristics and complexity of the signal acquired. In this review we focus on the common clinical neuromonitoring techniques including intracranial pressure, brain tissue oxygenation, transcranial doppler and near-infrared spectroscopy with a focus on how each modality can also provide useful information about cerebral autoregulation capacity. Finally, we discuss the current evidence in using these modalities to support clinical decision making as well as potential insights into the future of advanced cerebral homeostatic assessments including neurovascular coupling.
