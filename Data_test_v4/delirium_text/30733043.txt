30733043|a|BACKGROUND: Patients with cancer frequently experience neuropsychiatric symptoms due to their medical illness or its treatment. In recent decades, psychiatrists have become increasingly involved in the care of patients with cancer. However, psychiatrists may be less familiar with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), a distinct cancer treatment modality associated with multiple neuropsychiatric sequelae. OBJECTIVE: To provide an overview of HSCT, and describe the prevalence, impact, risk factors, and suggested management of psychiatric consequences of HSCT. METHODS: We performed literature searches in PubMed and PsychInfo to identify articles describing neuropsychiatric symptoms, including depression, anxiety, distress, post-traumatic stress disorder, delirium and cognitive impairment, resulting from HSCT in adults. Those articles most relevant to this manuscript were included. RESULTS: Psychiatrists may be involved in the treatment of patients before, during, or after inpatient hospitalization for HSCT. Each phase of treatment introduces unique stressors that may lead to or exacerbate psychiatric disorders. Appropriate management requires evaluation of HSCT-related medications, an understanding of the impact of complications from HSCT, and consideration of how the patient's underlying medical condition should influence psychiatric recommendations. CONCLUSION: To optimize patient outcomes, consulting psychiatrists should be familiar with the basic principles of HSCT, and the neuropsychiatric sequelae that may result from treatment. Further research is needed to identify strategies to manage psychiatric complications in this unique population.
