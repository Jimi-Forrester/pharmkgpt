36517647|a|BACKGROUND: The postulated benefits of the ketogenic diet in the management of multiple medical conditions have seen more patients who are in therapeutic ketosis attending 18F-FDG PET scans. This study aimed to investigate the effect of ketosis on cerebral glucose metabolism in a clinical PET scanning environment using 18F-FDG uptake as a surrogate marker. METHODS: A retrospective audit was conducted of the brain 18F-FDG uptake in 52 patients who underwent PET scans for possible cardiac sarcoidosis or suspected intracardiac infection, following a ketogenic diet and prolonged fasting. SUVbw for whole brain and separate brain regions was compared with serum glucose and serum ketone body (beta-hydroxybutyrate) levels. RESULTS: The expected negative association between serum glucose levels and whole brain 18F-FDG uptake was confirmed. A reduction in SUVbw due to increasing serum ketones levels was also observed that was independent of and in addition to the effects of glucose. The magnitude of the reduction in SUVbw related to serum glucose level and serum ketone level was found to be greater in the precuneus than in the cerebellum or whole brain. CONCLUSION: In a real-world clinical PET setting, cerebral 18F-FDG uptake appears to be affected by glycaemia and ketonaemia. This means when assessing the brain, both serum glucose and ketone levels need to be considered when SUVs are used to distinguish between pathologic and physiologic states. The magnitude of this effect appears to vary between different brain regions. This regional difference should be taken into consideration when selecting the appropriate brain region for SUV normalisation, particularly when undertaking database comparison in the assessment of dementia.
