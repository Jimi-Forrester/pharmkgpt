25400096|a|Although it is well documented that soluble beta amyloid (Abeta) oligomers are critical factors in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) by causing synaptic dysfunction and neuronal death, the primary mechanisms by which Abeta oligomers trigger neurodegeneration are not entirely understood. We sought to investigate whether toxic small Abeta(1-42) oligomers induce changes in plasma membrane potential of cultured neurons and glial cells in rat cerebellar granule cell cultures leading to neuronal death and whether these effects are sensitive to the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA-R) antagonist MK801. We found that small Abeta(1-42) oligomers induced rapid, protracted membrane depolarization of both neurons and microglia, whereas there was no change in membrane potential of astrocytes. MK801 did not modulate Abeta-induced neuronal depolarization. In contrast, Abeta1(-42) oligomer-induced decrease in plasma membrane potential of microglia was prevented by MK801. Small Abeta(1-42) oligomers significantly elevated extracellular glutamate and caused neuronal necrosis, and both were prevented by MK801. Also, small Abeta(1-42) oligomers decreased resistance of isolated brain mitochondria to calcium-induced opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pore. In conclusion, the results suggest that the primary effect of toxic small Abeta oligomers on neurons is rapid, NMDA-R-independent plasma membrane depolarization, which leads to neuronal death. Abeta oligomers-induced depolarization of microglial cells is NMDA-R dependent.
