38539799|t|Understanding the Factors That Influence the Antioxidant Activity of Manganosalen Complexes with Neuroprotective Effects.
38539799|a|Manganosalen complexes are a class of catalytic antioxidants with beneficial effects against different neurological disorders according to various in vitro and in vivo studies. The interest in the factors that determine their antioxidant activity is based on the fact that they are key to achieving more efficient models. In this work, we report a set of new manganosalen complexes, thoroughly characterized in the solid state and in solution by different techniques. The chelating Schiff base ligands used were prepared from condensation of different substituted hydroxybenzaldehydes with 1,2-diaminoethane and 1,3-diaminopropane. The antioxidant activity of the new models was tested through superoxide dismutase and catalase probes in conjunction with the studies about their neuroprotective effects in human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells in an oxidative stress model. The ability to scavenge excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) varied depending on the manganosalen models, which also yielded different improvements in cell survival. An assessment of the different factors that affect the oxidant activity for these complexes, and others previously reported, revealed the major influence of the structural factors versus the redox properties of the manganosalen complexes.
