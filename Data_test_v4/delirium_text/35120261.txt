35120261|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder, and there is a pressing need to identify disease-modifying factors and devise interventional strategies. The circadian clock, our intrinsic biological timer, orchestrates various cellular and physiological processes including gene expression, sleep, and neuroinflammation; conversely, circadian dysfunctions are closely associated with and/or contribute to AD hallmarks. We previously reported that the natural compound Nobiletin (NOB) is a clock-enhancing modulator that promotes physiological health and healthy aging. In the current study, we treated the double transgenic AD model mice, APP/PS1, with NOB-containing diets. NOB significantly alleviated beta-amyloid burden in both the hippocampus and the cortex, and exhibited a trend to improve cognitive function in these mice. While several systemic parameters for circadian wheel-running activity, sleep, and metabolism were unchanged, NOB treatment showed a marked effect on the expression of clock and clock-controlled AD gene expression in the cortex. In accordance, cortical proteomic profiling demonstrated circadian time-dependent restoration of the protein landscape in APP/PS1 mice treated with NOB. More importantly, we found a potent efficacy of NOB to inhibit proinflammatory cytokine gene expression and inflammasome formation in the cortex, and immunostaining further revealed a specific effect to diminish astrogliosis, but not microgliosis, by NOB in APP/PS1 mice. Together, these results underscore beneficial effects of a clock modulator to mitigate pathological and cognitive hallmarks of AD, and suggest a possible mechanism via suppressing astrogliosis-associated neuroinflammation.
