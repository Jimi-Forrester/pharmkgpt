25677850|a|Amyloid-beta (Abeta)-degrading enzymes are known to degrade Abeta peptides, a causative agent of Alzheimer's disease. These enzymes are responsible for maintaining Abeta concentration. However, loss of such enzymes or their Abeta-degrading activity because of certain genetic as well as nongenetic reasons initiates the accumulation of Abeta peptides in the human brain. Considering the limitations of the human enzymes in clearing Abeta peptide, the search for microbial enzymes that could cleave Abeta is necessary. Hence, we built a three-dimensional model of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) from Stigmatella aurantiaca using homology modeling technique. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation techniques were used to outline the possible cleavage mechanism of Abeta peptide. These findings suggest that catalytic residue Glu 434 of the model could play a crucial role to degrade Abeta peptide between Asp 7 and Ser 8. Thus, ACE from S. aurantiaca might cleave Abeta peptides similar to human ACE and could be used to design new therapeutic strategies against Alzheimer's disease.
