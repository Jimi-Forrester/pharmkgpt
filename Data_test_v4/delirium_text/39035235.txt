39035235|a|Objective: To develop, assess, and refine an online educational tool, Plan for Clarity, to support financial and legal planning in dementia. Methods: A Delphi mixed-method study with three rounds of anonymous review by lay and professional stakeholders was designed to reach consensus about the content of the online tool and explore the socio-cultural and behavioral factors that could affect access and use. Results: Consensus showed that the online tool covered key information, knowledge, and communication skills for financial and legal planning. Study themes: 1) the online tool had to be easy to navigate with relevant, easily understood information; 2) people with early signs of memory difficulties would be able to use the tool; 3) a referral from a trusted source is a primary way to facilitate access and use of the tool; and 4) discussions about financial and legal issues should be held early, ahead of barriers that can block discussion. Conclusion: These data suggest this online tool is relevant and feasible for dementia care and support as well as aging more generally. Innovation: Plan for Clarity is innovative as an evidence and theory-driven online education tool to address financial and legal planning for dementia care, particularly among underserved older adults.
