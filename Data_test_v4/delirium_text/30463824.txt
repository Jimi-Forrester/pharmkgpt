30463824|t|Effect of dexmedetomidine on postoperative delirium in elderly patients undergoing hip fracture surgery.
30463824|a|Dexmedetomidine is a highly selective central alpha2 adrenergic receptor agonist, which has anti sympathetic, sedative and analgesic effects. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of dexmedetomidine on postoperative delirium in elderly patients undergoing hip fracture surgery. The results showed that the dosage of sufentanil and propofol decreased significantly in the experimental group (P<0.05). The price-henry pain scores of 10min, 1H and 6h in the experimental group were significantly reduced after the operation. At the same time, there were 3 cases (4.28%) of postoperative delirium in the experimental group, which were significantly less than 12 cases (17.14%) in the control group. The dosage of propofol in the operation is a risk factor for postoperative delirium. Dexmedetomidin can significantly reduce the amount of propofol in the operation and it has a neuroprotective effect, which can reduce the incidence of postoperative delirium in the elderly. In the elderly patients with hip surgery, its adjuvant to general anesthesia can effectively reduce narcotic drug dosage and reduce the incidence of postoperative delirium.
