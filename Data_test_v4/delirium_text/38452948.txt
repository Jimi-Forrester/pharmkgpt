38452948|a|Neuroinflammation contributes to the pathology and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and it can be observed even with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a prodromal phase of AD. Free water (FW) imaging estimates the extracellular water content and has been used to study neuroinflammation across several neurological diseases including AD. Recently, the role of gut microbiota has been implicated in the pathogenesis of AD. The relationship between FW imaging and gut microbiota was examined in patients with AD and MCI. Fifty-six participants underwent neuropsychological assessments, FW imaging, and gut microbiota analysis targeting the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. They were categorized into the cognitively normal control (NC) (n = 19), MCI (n = 19), and AD (n = 18) groups according to the neuropsychological assessments. The correlations of FW values, neuropsychological assessment scores, and the relative abundance of gut microbiota were analyzed. FW was higher in several white matter tracts and in gray matter regions, predominantly the frontal, temporal, limbic and paralimbic regions in the AD/MCI group than in the NC group. In the AD/MCI group, higher FW values in the temporal (superior temporal and temporal pole), limbic and paralimbic (insula, hippocampus and amygdala) regions were the most associated with worse neuropsychological assessment scores. In the AD/MCI group, FW values in these regions were negatively correlated with the relative abundances of butyrate-producing genera Anaerostipes, Lachnospiraceae UCG-004, and [Ruminococcus] gnavus group, which showed a significant decreasing trend in the order of the NC, MCI, and AD groups. The present study showed that increased FW in the gray matter regions related to cognitive impairment was associated with low abundances of butyrate producers in the AD/MCI group. These findings suggest an association between neuroinflammation and decreased levels of the short-chain fatty acid butyrate that is one of the major gut microbial metabolites having a potentially beneficial role in brain homeostasis.
