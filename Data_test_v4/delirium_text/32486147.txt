32486147|t|Genista tridentata L.: A Rich Source of Flavonoids with Anti-inflammatory Activity.
32486147|a|: Background: Genista tridentata L. is an endemic species from the Iberian Peninsula used in Portuguese traditional medicine to treat inflammation-related diseases; this and other health-promoting effects are usually associated with the flavonoids produced by this species. In fact, anti-inflammatory properties were established for several of these flavonoid derivatives. Methods: A careful survey of the reported data, using mainly the Scopus database and Genista tridentata and Pterospartum tridentatum as keywords, was done. We have examined the papers involving the plant and those about the most relevant flavonoids anti-inflammatory activity. Results: The literature survey demonstrates that species are used to treat several health problems such as antihyperglycemia, hypertension, and inflammatory episodes. It was also possible to establish its richness in flavonoid derivatives, from which several are potential anti-inflammatory agents. Conclusions: From our described and discussed analysis, it can be concluded that Genista tridentata is an excellent source of bioactive flavonoids. Moreover, its traditional use to treat inflammation episodes may be due to its flavonoid content, from which genistein, biochanin A, rutin, and daidzein can be emphasized.
