35061226|t|Diagnosis of Generalized Pustular Psoriasis.
35061226|a|Generalized pustular psoriasis (GPP) is a severe rare skin disease characterized by widespread eruption of sterile superficial macroscopic pustules with or without systemic inflammation. Generalized pustular psoriasis flares may lead to life-threatening multiorgan complications, which highlights the need for rapid and accurate diagnosis. However, the rarity of the disease and its heterogeneous cutaneous and extracutaneous symptoms, and the resemblance of symptoms to other skin conditions, pose considerable challenges to the timely diagnosis and treatment of patients with GPP. Current laboratory tests used for GPP diagnosis are generally not GPP specific, and are mainly focused on the assessment of inflammatory markers and clinical and histopathologic features of GPP, and emerging genetic screening approaches. A differential diagnosis to distinguish GPP from other similar conditions requires careful assessment of the patient's skin symptoms, potential disease triggers, medical history, histopathologic features, laboratory tests, and clinical disease course. The comprehensive interpretation of these assessments can be challenging owing to the lack of standardized global guidelines. While there is currently a lack of standardized international guidelines for the diagnosis of GPP, recent advances in our understanding of the genetics and pathogenesis of the disease have provided new opportunities to enhance diagnosis. In the future, defining specific GPP subtypes using genetic and histopathologic strategies will guide therapeutic decisions, allowing patients to achieve their treatment goals without delay. In this article, we provide an overview of the current diagnostic methods, differential diagnostic strategies, and future advances in the diagnosis of GPP, as well as features of GPP variants.
