39589951|a|BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) are a very important medical problem. The key role of mitochondrial dysfunction (MD) in the occurrence and progression of NCDs has been proven. However, the etiology and pathogenesis of MD itself in many NCDs has not yet been clarified, which makes it one of the most serious medical problems in the modern world, according to many scientists. METHODS: An extensive research in the literature was implemented in order to elucidate the role of MD and NCDs' risk factors in the pathogenesis of NCDs. RESULTS: The authors propose to take a broader look at the problem of the pathogenesis of NCDs. It is important to understand exactly how NCD risk factors lead to MD. The review is structured in such a way as to answer this question. Based on a systematic analysis of scientific data, a theoretical concept of modern views on the occurrence of MD under the influence of risk factors for the occurrence of NCDs is presented. This was done in order to update MD issues in clinical medicine. MD and NCDs progress throughout a patient's life. Based on this, the review raised the question of the existence of an NCDs continuum. CONCLUSIONS: MD is a universal mechanism that causes organ dysfunction and comorbidity of NCDs. Prevention of MD involves diagnosing and eliminating the factors that cause it. Mitochondria are an important therapeutic target.
