11166713|a|Our previous studies have shown that a minor isoform of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is increased in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. In the present study, the glycosylation of butyrycholinesterase (BuChE) was found to be altered in AD CSF. By combining an analysis of CSF AChE and BuChE glycosylation, it is possible to identify cases of AD with more than 90% sensitivity and specificity.
