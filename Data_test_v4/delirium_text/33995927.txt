33995927|a|INTRODUCTION: Parkinson Disease (PD), the second most common chronic neurodegenerative disorder, is characterized by tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity, and postural instability. SHANK3 (SH3 and multiple ankyrin repeat domain 3) belongs to the extremely conserved ProSAP/Shank family of synaptic scaffolding proteins. Meanwhile, rs9616915 is a non-synonymous SNP (T>C) located in the exon 6 of the SHANK3 gene, which induces substitution of isoleucine to threonine and affects the function of the resulted protein. The present study aimed to evaluate whether rs9616915 polymorphism of SHANK3 is involved in the susceptibility to PD. METHODS: The study subjects were 100 patients diagnosed with PD and 100 control volunteers. The obtained samples were evaluated by the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method. RESULTS: A significant association was found in genotype distribution between cases and controls. Individuals with TC genotype had increased risk of PD (P=0.035, OR=1.98, 95% CI=1.04 - 3.74). No significant difference was found in allele distribution (P=0.7). CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that the SHANK3 rs9616915 polymorphism is associated with an increased risk of PD in the population. Further studies are needed to confirm the role of the SHANK3 gene in PD.
