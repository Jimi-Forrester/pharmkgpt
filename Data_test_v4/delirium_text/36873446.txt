36873446|t|Glymphatic system impairment in nonathlete older male adults who played contact sports in their youth associated with cognitive decline: A diffusion tensor image analysis along the perivascular space study.
36873446|a|Background and purpose: Exposure to contact sports in youth causes brain health problems later in life. For instance, the repetitive head impacts in contact sports might contribute to glymphatic clearance impairment and cognitive decline. This study aimed to assess the effect of contact sports participation in youth on glymphatic function in old age and the relationship between glymphatic function and cognitive status using the analysis along the perivascular space (ALPS) index. Materials and methods: A total of 52 Japanese older male subjects were included in the study, including 12 who played heavy-contact sports (mean age, 71.2 years), 15 who played semicontact sports (mean age, 73.1 years), and 25 who played noncontact sports (mean age, 71.3 years) in their youth. All brain diffusion-weighted images (DWIs) of the subjects were acquired using a 3T MRI scanner. The ALPS indices were calculated using a validated semiautomated pipeline. The ALPS indices from the left and right hemispheres were compared between groups using a general linear model, including age and years of education. Furthermore, partial Spearman's rank correlation tests were performed to assess the correlation between the ALPS indices and cognitive scores (Mini-Mental State Examination and the Japanese version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment [MoCA-J]) after adjusting for age years of education and HbA1c. Results: The left ALPS index was significantly lower in the heavy-contact and semicontact groups than that in the noncontact group. Although no significant differences were observed in the left ALPS index between the heavy-contact and semicontact groups and in the right ALPS index among groups, a trend toward lower was found in the right ALPS index in individuals with semicontact and heavy-contact compared to the noncontact group. Both sides' ALPS indices were significantly positively correlated with the MoCA-J scores. Conclusion: The findings indicated the potential adverse effect of contact sports experience in youth on the glymphatic system function in old age associated with cognitive decline.
