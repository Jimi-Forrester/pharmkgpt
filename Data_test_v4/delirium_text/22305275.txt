22305275|t|Ropren( ) is a polyprenol preparation from coniferous plants that ameliorates cognitive deficiency in a rat model of beta-amyloid peptide-(25-35)-induced amnesia.
22305275|a|This study assesses the efficacy of a fixed dose of Ropren( ) (a plant preparation isolated from the neutral fraction of an extract of spruce needles) on cognitive impairment in rats with beta-amyloid peptide-(25-35)-induced amnesia. Ropren( ) was administered at a dose of 8.6mg/kg for 28 days, per os, to rats with beta-amyloid peptide-(25-35)-induced amnesia. Cognitive performance was assessed using the passive avoidance paradigm and the Morris water maze and behavior was assessed using the open field test. After four weeks, Ropren( ) treatment significantly improved non-spatial and spatial learning in rats with beta-amyloid peptide-(25-35)-induced amnesia. The results of the present study suggest that Ropren( ), a novel plant preparation, ameliorates cognitive deficiencies in an animal model relevant to Alzheimer's disease.
