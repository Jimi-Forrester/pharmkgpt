2085920|t|[Cerebral blood flow and cerebral oxygen metabolism in patients with dementia of frontal lobe type].
2085920|a|This study was designed to investigate the differences in cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) between patients with dementia of frontal lobe type and patients with Alzheimer's disease. Positron emission tomography (PET) using 15O steady state inhalation technique was carried out in 5 patients with a clinical diagnosis of dementia of frontal lobe type and 7 patients with a clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. CBF and CMRO2 were significantly decreased in the frontal cortex except for precentral region in patients with dementia of frontal lobe type in comparison to those values in patients with Alzheimer's disease. However, in patients with dementia of frontal lobe type CBF and CMRO2 in the parietal cortex and the occipital cortex were relatively preserved when compared with patients with Alzheimer's disease. In comparison with values for CBF and CMRO2 in the posterior part of brain [frontal or temporal/(parietal + occipital)/2 ratio], both values in the frontal cortex were markedly decreased in all 5 patients with dementia of frontal lobe type, but there was no marked reduction in the frontal cortex in patients with Alzheimer's disease. In addition, in 2 patients with dementia of frontal lobe type whose duration of the disease was more than 7 years, CBF and CMRO2 in the temporal cortex were markedly reduced in comparison with values in the posterior part of brain. These results suggested that PET findings of marked reduction in CBF and CMRO2 in the frontal cortex are useful to distinguish dementia of frontal lobe type from Alzheimer's disease.
