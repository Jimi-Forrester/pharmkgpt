36138485|a|BACKGROUND: This study aimed to identify cases of potential prodromal DLB in very late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis (VLOSLP), using indicative biomarkers of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and to evaluate the characteristics of psychosis as prodromal DLB. METHODS: Data of patients with VLOSLP without dementia and Parkinsonism, who underwent testing for at least one indicative biomarker of DLB, were retrospectively collected from the database of the psychiatry clinic at the Osaka University Hospital. Patients were divided into two groups based on the positive (VLOSLP+LB) and negative (VLOSLP-LB) results of the indicative biomarkers of DLB. Age, gender, cognitive battery scores, prevalence of each type of delusions and hallucinations, cerebral volume, and cerebral perfusion were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: Eleven VLOSLP+LB and 23 VLOSLP-LB participants were enrolled. There were no significant differences in age, proportion of females, and MMSE scores between the two groups. The standardized score of the digit symbol substitution test was significantly lower in the VLOSLP+LB than in VLOSLP-LB group (6.9 [3.1] vs. 10.0 [2.7], p = 0.005). The prevalence of visual hallucinations was significantly higher in the VLOSLP+LB group than in the VLOSLP-LB group (81.8% vs. 26.1%, p = 0.003). Auditory hallucinations were prevalent in both groups (43.5% in VLOSLP-LB, and 45.5% in VLOSLP+LB). Among patients with auditory hallucinations, auditory hallucinations without coexistent visual hallucinations tended to be more prevalent in VLOSLP-LB (7 out of 10) than in VLOSLP+LB patients (1 out of 5). Although cerebral volume was not different in any region, cerebral perfusion in the posterior region, including the occipital lobe, was significantly lower in the VLOSLP+LB group. CONCLUSIONS: Psychomotor slowing, visual hallucinations, and reduced perfusion in the occipital lobe may be suggestive of prodromal DLB in VLOSLP patients, even though the clinical manifestations were similar in many respects between VLOSLP+LB and VLOSLP-LB. Although auditory hallucinations were prevalent in both groups, most patients in VLOSLP+LB complained of auditory hallucinations along with visual hallucinations. Future studies with a larger number of patients without selection bias are desirable.
