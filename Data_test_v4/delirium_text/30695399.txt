30695399|t|[A Therapeutic Target for Inhibition of Neurodegeneration: Autophagy].
30695399|a|The role of autophagy in cell survival and suppression of neurodegeneration was considered. We discussed its involvement in Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's diseases connected with accumulation of amy- loid-beta, alpha-synuclein, and huntingtin, respectively. Autophagy is reduced in these diseases and in aging as well to various extent. Elimination of accumulated toxic proteins and structures is performed by autophagy mech- anisms (chaperon-mediated autophagy, macroautophagy, selected autophagy) in an interaction with ubiqui- tin-proteasome system. In many cases activation of mTOR-dependent autophagy and mTOR-independent regulatory pathways lead to the therapeutic effect of inhibition of neurodegeneration in cell cultures and an- imal models. Some autophagy enhancers such as resveratrol, metformin, rilmenidine, lithium, and curcumin are tested now in clinical trials.
