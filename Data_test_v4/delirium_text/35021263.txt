35021263|t|Effect of earplug/eye mask on sleep and delirium in intensive care patients.
35021263|a|BACKGROUND: Environmental factors such as loud sounds and bright lights in intensive care units can cause sleep disorders and delirium. AIM: The present study aims to investigate the effects of the overnight use of earplugs and eye masks by intensive care patients on their sleep quality and the degree of delirium. STUDY DESIGN: This randomized controlled experimental study was conducted on the patients admitted to a coronary intensive care unit. METHODS: The patients in the experimental group used earplugs and eye masks during the night, while those in the control group received only routine care. Data were collected using an information form, the Richards-Campbell sleep questionnaire (RCSQ), and the intensive care delirium screening checklist (ICDSC). RESULTS: The study included a total of 84 patients, 42 in the experimental group and 42 in the control group. The baseline average score of the patients in the experiment group on the RCSQ was 40.11 +- 16.55, with a Time 1 average score of 64.09 +- 14.07 and a Time 2 average score of 72.07 +- 11.75; their baseline average score on the ICDSC was 0.47 +- 0.50, with a Time 1 average score of 0.33 +- 065 and a Time 2 average score of 0.19 +- 039. The baseline average score of the patients in the control group on the RCSQ was 44.07 +- 7.30, with a Time 1 average score of 46.97 +- 9.22 and a Time 2 average score of 47.04 +- 11.53; the baseline average score of the control group on the ICDSC was 0.42 +- 0.50, with a Time 1 average score of 0.50 +- 0.70 and a Time 2 average score of 0.57 +- 0.66. A statistically significant difference was found between the Time 1 and Time 2 average scores of the experimental and control groups on the RCSQ and between the Time 2 average scores of the experimental and control groups on the ICDSC (U = 198.00, P < .001; U = 70.000, P < .001; U = 614.000, P =  004 respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The earplugs and eye masks used by the intensive care patients overnight were associated with an increase in sleep quality and a decrease in the degree of delirium. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The use of earplugs and eye masks is recommended for intensive care units in supporting sleep quality and preventing delirium.
