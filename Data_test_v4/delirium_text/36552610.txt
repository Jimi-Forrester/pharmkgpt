36552610|t|Therapeutics of Alzheimer's Disease: Recent Developments.
36552610|a|With increasing aging, dementia is a growing public health concern globally. Patients with dementia have multiple psychological and behavioral changes, including depression, anxiety, inappropriate behavior, paranoia, agitation, and hallucinations. The major types of dementia are Alzheimer's disease (AD), vascular dementia (VCID), Lewy body dementia (LBD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and mixed dementia (MiAD). Among these, AD is the most common form of dementia in the elderly population. In the last three decades, tremendous progress has been made in understanding AD's biology and disease progression, particularly its molecular basis, biomarker development, and drug discovery. Multiple cellular changes have been implicated in the progression of AD, including amyloid beta, phosphorylated tau, synaptic damage, mitochondrial dysfunction, deregulated microRNAs, inflammatory changes, hormonal deregulation, and others; based on these changes, therapeutic strategies have been developed, which are currently being tested in animal models and human clinical trials. The purpose of our article is to highlight recent therapeutic strategies' developments, critically discuss current strategies' failures, and propose new strategies to combat this devasting mental illness.
