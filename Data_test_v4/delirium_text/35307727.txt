35307727|t|Clinical Application of Enteral Nutrition Combined with Microbial Preparation for Intestinal Preparation in Elderly Patients with Colorectal Cancer.
35307727|a|BACKGROUND The purpose of this study was to determine the safety and efficacy of enteral nutrition in combination with microbial preparations for bowel preparation in elderly patients with colorectal cancer. MATERIAL AND METHODS Were divided 160 patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer into a control group (n=80) and an experimental group (n=80) by random number table method. The control group took the traditional intestinal preparation, and the experimental group took oral enteral nutrition combined with microbial preparations. Both groups were treated by the same medical team. The postoperative recovery, complications, nutritional status, inflammation, and other indicators of the 2 groups were compared. RESULTS The nutritional status of the experimental group was significantly better than that of the control group, the incidence of tissue inflammation and postoperative complications was significantly lower than that of the control group, and the stool test results of patients with postoperative diarrhea were better than those of the control group, and the difference between groups was statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS The intestinal preparation using enteral nutrition combined with microbial preparations can alleviate the systemic inflammatory response in elderly patients, improve the nutritional status, reduce the occurrence of postoperative complications, and facilitate rapid postoperative recovery.
