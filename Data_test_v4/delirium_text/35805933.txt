35805933|a|Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has ushered in a new era in cancer treatment. Remarkable outcomes have been demonstrated in patients with previously untreatable relapsed/refractory hematological malignancies. However, optimizing efficacy and reducing the risk of toxicities have posed major challenges, limiting the success of this therapy. The tumor microenvironment (TME) plays an important role in CAR T cell therapy's effectiveness and the risk of toxicities. Increasing research studies have also identified various biomarkers that can predict its effectiveness and risk of toxicities. In this review, we discuss the various aspects of the TME and biomarkers that have been implicated thus far and discuss the role of creating scoring systems that can aid in further refining clinical applications of CAR T cell therapy and establishing a safe and efficacious personalised medicine for individuals.
