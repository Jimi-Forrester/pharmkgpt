29962617|t|Comparison of Ketamine with Midazolam versus Ketamine with Fentanyl for Pediatric Extracorporeal Shock Wave Lithotripsy Procedure: A Randomized Controlled Study.
29962617|a|OBJECTIVES: To compare the effects of ketamine-fentanyl (KF) and ketamine-midazolam (KM) combinations on hemodynamic parameters, recovery properties, pain, and side effects in pediatric patients undergoing extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) procedure. METHODOLOGY: In this double-blinded, randomized trial, 60 pediatric patients aged between 1 and 13 years with American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status Classes I and II, who scheduled for ESWL procedure, were included in the study. Patients were randomly divided into two groups: Group KM received 0.1 mg/kg of midazolam +1-1.5 mg/kg of ketamine and Group KF received 1 mug/kg of fentanyl +1-1.5 mg/kg of ketamine intravenously. RESULTS: There were similar demographic properties, recovery, and discharge times between groups. No statistically significant difference was found in peripheral oxygen saturation, mean and diastolic blood pressure, Ramsey sedation scores, modified Aldrete recovery scores, side effects, and recovery times (Group KM, 16.067 +- 1.2 min; Group KF, 19.46 +- 0.86 min) between groups (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: KF combination offers better hemodynamic properties, less side effects with lower visual analog scores, and face, legs, activity, cry, and consolability scores than KM in the pediatric ESWL procedure.
