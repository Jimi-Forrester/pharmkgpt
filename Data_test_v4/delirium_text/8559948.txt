8559948|t|The phenomenology of perceptual hallucinations in alcohol-induced delirium tremens.
8559948|a|In a qualified detoxication, states of anxiety caused by hallucinations can be specifically assimilated and psychologically reduced. Knowledge of the hallucinations experienced promotes the subsequent motivation phase. A semistandardized investigation of 64 patients with alcohol-induced delirium tremens was carried out over a period of 14 months in order to establish the nature of their perceptual hallucinations. Visual hallucinations predominated followed by auditory and tactile perceptual hallucinations. Amongst visual hallucinations pertaining to animals, the well-known 'white mice' were only reported once. Hallucinated cats, dogs, and snakes were most frequent, and were only then followed by mice (in general).
