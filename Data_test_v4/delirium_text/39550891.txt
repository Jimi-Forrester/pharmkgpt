39550891|t|Exploring the rhodanine universe: Design and synthesis of fluorescent rhodanine-based derivatives as anti-fibrillar and anti-oligomer agents against alpha-synuclein and 2N4R tau.
39550891|a|Tau and alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) are prone-to-aggregate proteins that can be responsible for pathological lesions found in the brains of Alzheimer's disease (AD), Lewy body dementia (LBD), and Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. The early-stage oligomers and protofibrils of tau are believed to be strongly linked to human cognitive impairment while the toxic alpha-syn oligomers are associated with behavioral motor deficits. Therefore, concurrent targeting of both proteinaceous aggregates and oligomers are very challenging. Herein, rhodanine-based compounds were designed and synthesized to target the fibrils and oligomers of tau and alpha-syn proteins. In particular, the indole-containing rhodanines 5l and 5r displayed significantly high anti-aggregation activity towards alpha-syn fibrils by reducing of the thioflavin-T (ThT) fluorescence to less than 5 %. Moreover, 5r showed a remarkable decrease in the fluorescence of thioflavin-S (ThS) when incubated with the non-phosphorylated tau 0N4R and 2N4R, as well as the hyperphosphorylated tau isoform 1N4R. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses validated the powerful anti-fibrillar activity of 5l and 5r towards both protein aggregates. In addition, both 5l and 5r highly suppressed 0N4R tau and alpha-syn oligomer formation using the photo-induced cross-linking of unmodified protein (PICUP) assay. The fluorescence emission intensity of 5l was quenched to almost half in the presence of both protein fibrils at 510 nm. 5r showed a similar fluorescence response upon binding to 2N4R fibrils while no quenching effect was observed with alpha-syn aggregates. Ex vivo disaggregation assay using extracted human Abeta plaques was employed to confirm the ability of 5l and 5r to disaggregate the dense fibrils. Both inhibitors reduced the Abeta fibrils isolated from AD brains. 5l and 5r failed to show activity toward the cell-based alpha-syn inclusion formation. However, another indolyl derivative 5j prevented the alpha-syn inclusion at 5 microM. Collectively, the indolyl-rhodanine scaffold could act as a building block for further structural optimization to obtain dual targeting disease-modifying candidates for AD, LBD, and PD.
