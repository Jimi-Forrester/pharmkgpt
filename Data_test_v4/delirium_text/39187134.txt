39187134|t|Sarcopenia and cognitive impairment in older adults: Long-term prognostic implications based on the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2011-2014).
39187134|a|AIMS: The relationship between sarcopenia and cognitive impairment in older adults remains contentious. This study investigates this association and examines the long-term prognosis for individuals with both conditions. METHODS: Utilizing data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2011 to 2014, this study focuses on the correlation between sarcopenia and cognitive impairment, as well as the extended prognosis for individuals managing these conditions. RESULTS: The study cohort comprised 2890 participants, with 648 (22.4 %) diagnosed with sarcopenia. Multivariable logistic regression analysis identified a significant association between sarcopenia and an increased risk of cognitive impairment (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 1.68, 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1.30-2.17). Over a median follow-up period of 48 months, 200 individuals (6.9 %) succumbed to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases (CCVDs), including hypertension, congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, and stroke, as well as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Participants had comorbid conditions such as CCVDs and diabetes mellitus. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and the Cox proportional hazards model indicated that individuals with both sarcopenia and cognitive impairment had the highest mortality risk from CCVDs and AD (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]: 2.73, 95 % CI: 1.48-5.02). Individuals with sarcopenia and comorbidities exhibited a higher mortality risk from CCVDs or AD compared to those without sarcopenia but with comorbidities (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]: 2.71, 95 % CI: 1.37-5.37). CONCLUSION: Sarcopenia is independently associated with cognitive impairment. Older adults with both sarcopenia and cognitive impairment or concurrent comorbidities face increased mortality risks from CCVDs or AD compared to their healthy counterparts. CLINICAL IMPLICATION:
