12697263|a|The N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-selective subtype of ionotropic glutamate receptor is of importance in neuronal differentiation and synapse consolidation, activity-dependent forms of synaptic plasticity, and excitatory amino acid-mediated neuronal toxicity [Neurosci. Res. Program Bull. 19 (1981) 1; Lab. Invest. 68 (1993) 372]. NMDA receptors exist in vivo as tetrameric or pentameric complexes comprising proteins from two families of homologous subunits, designated NR1 and NR2(A-D) [Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 185 (1992) 826]. The gene coding for the human NR1 subunit (hNR1) is composed of 21 exons, three of which (4, 20 and 21) can be differentially spliced to generate a total of eight distinct subunit variants. We detail here a competitive RT-PCR (cRT-PCR) protocol to quantify endogenous levels of hNR1 splice variants in autopsied human brain. Quantitation of each hNR1 splice variant is performed using standard curve methodology in which a known amount of synthetic ribonucleic acid competitor (internal standard) is co-amplified against total RNA. This method can be used for the quantitation of hNR1 mRNA levels in response to acute or chronic disease states, in particular in the glutamatergic-associated neuronal loss observed in Alzheimer's disease [J. Neurochem. 78 (2001) 175]. Furthermore, alterations in hNR1 mRNA expression may be reflected at the translational level, resulting in functional changes in the NMDA receptor.
