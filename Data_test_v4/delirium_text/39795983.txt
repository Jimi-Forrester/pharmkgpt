39795983|a|Chronic diseases, including cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases and cancer, are significant global health challenges. Oxidative stress, characterized by an imbalance between reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and antioxidant defenses, is a critical factor in the progression of these pathologies. Lactoferrin (Lf), a multifunctional iron-binding glycoprotein, has emerged as a promising therapeutic agent due to its potent antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and iron-regulating properties. Lf plays a pivotal role in iron homeostasis by chelating iron, modulating its cellular uptake, and reducing ROS production, thereby mitigating oxidative stress-related tissue damage. Lf also demonstrates neuroprotective potential in diseases like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's, where it alleviates oxidative damage, regulates iron metabolism, and enhances antioxidant defenses. Furthermore, its ability to enhance endogenous antioxidant mechanisms, such as superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase, underscores its systemic protective effects. Lf's anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial activities also contribute to its broad-spectrum protective role in chronic diseases. This review consolidates evidence of Lf's mechanisms in mitigating oxidative stress and highlights its therapeutic potential as a versatile molecule for preventing and managing chronic conditions linked to oxidative damage.
