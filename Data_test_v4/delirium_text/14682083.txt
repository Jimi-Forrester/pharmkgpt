14682083|a|This study examined 1) whether patients diagnosed with dementia of the Alzheimer type spontaneously form verbal labels to remember nonmeaningful sequences of hand movements, 2) whether an instruction for a verbal labeling (VL) strategy could enhance memory performance, and 3) whether a relationship exists between the memory span for hand movements and a score on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Of 18 Alzheimer's patients, 16 did not use the VL strategy spontaneously. However, if instructed, 12 of these 16 were able to use the technique. Of these 12, four were able to retain the strategy. There was a significant correlation only between the movement memory span and the MMSE. Meta-memory of VL seems independent of visuospatial memory and cognitive status.
