6685171|a|The present investigation was designed to study the ultrastructural integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in the cerebral microvasculature of scrapie-infected mice showing clinical illness. Cerebral microvessels from either IM, VM, or C57BL/6J mice, terminally affected with various strains of scrapie agent showed a focal leakage of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) in all agent-strain and mouse-strain combinations. This leakage was most pronounced in and near the primary site of agent inoculation, but was also observed in microvessels scattered throughout the brain. Cytochemical studies also revealed a redistribution of plasmalemma-bound alkaline phosphatase in the endothelial cells. In control mice, the enzymatic activity was mainly concentrated in the luminal plasmalemma, while in the scrapie-infected mice the activity also appeared in the abluminal side in the majority of microvessels. Our observations are evidence that the BBB of the mouse is altered in some way by the scrapie agent. Such an alteration may have important implications for human disease, since the scrapie agent is related to the group of "slow" viral infections, including kuru and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Scrapie may also serve as an important model for the study of senile dementia of the Alzheimer type (SDAT).
