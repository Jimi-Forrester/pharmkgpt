30210292|a|The triggers of late-onset sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) are still poorly understood. Impairment of protein phosphorylation with age is well-known; however, the role of the phosphorylation in beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) is not studied sufficiently. Zinc-induced oligomerization of Abeta represents a potential seeding mechanism for the formation of neurotoxic Abeta oligomers and aggregates. Phosphorylation of Abeta by Ser8 (pS8-Abeta), localized inside the zinc-binding domain of the peptide, may significantly alter its zinc-induced oligomerization. Indeed, using dynamic light scattering, we have shown that phosphorylation by Ser8 dramatically reduces zinc-induced aggregation of Abeta, and moreover pS8-Abeta suppresses zinc-driven aggregation of non-modified Abeta in an equimolar mixture. We have further analyzed the effect of pS8-Abeta on the progression of cerebral amyloidosis with serial retro-orbital injections of the peptide in APPSwe/PSEN1dE9 murine model of AD, followed by histological analysis of amyloid burden in hippocampus. Unlike the non-modified Abeta that has no influence on the amyloidosis progression in murine models of AD, pS8-Abeta injections reduced the number of amyloid plaques in the hippocampus of mice by one-third. Recently shown inhibition of Na+,K+-ATPase activity by Abeta, which is thought to be a major contributor to neuronal dysfunction in AD, is completely reversed by phosphorylation of the peptide. Thus, several AD-associated pathogenic properties of Abeta are neutralized by its phosphorylation.
