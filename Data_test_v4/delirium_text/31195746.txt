31195746|t|Interference with Amyloid-beta Nucleation by Transient Ligand Interaction.
31195746|a|Amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) is an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) associated with Alzheimer's disease. The structural flexibility and aggregation propensity of Abeta pose major challenges for elucidating the interaction between Abeta monomers and ligands. All-D-peptides consisting solely of D-enantiomeric amino acid residues are interesting drug candidates that combine high binding specificity with high metabolic stability. Here we characterized the interaction between the 12-residue all-D-peptide D3 and Abeta42 monomers, and how the interaction influences Abeta42 aggregation. We demonstrate for the first time that D3 binds to Abeta42 monomers with submicromolar affinities. These two highly unstructured molecules are able to form complexes with 1:1 and other stoichiometries. Further, D3 at substoichiometric concentrations effectively slows down the beta-sheet formation and Abeta42 fibrillation by modulating the nucleation process. The study provides new insights into the molecular mechanism of how D3 affects Abeta assemblies and contributes to our knowledge on the interaction between two IDPs.
