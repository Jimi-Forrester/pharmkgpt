20164573|t|Genetic association between CALHM1, 2, and 3 polymorphisms and Alzheimer's disease in a Japanese population.
20164573|a|A recent paper reported that a variant (rs2986017) of the calcium homeostasis modulator 1 (CALHM1) gene affects risk for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study aims to investigate whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the CALHM1 gene are associated with AD. SNPs in the genes of two other CALHM subtypes, CALHM2 and CALHM3, were also studied. Our study failed to detect any association between the SNPs of the three genes and AD. Although rs729211 showed marginal association in the APOE4 negative group, the linkage disequilibrium analysis results suggest this to be a false positive.
