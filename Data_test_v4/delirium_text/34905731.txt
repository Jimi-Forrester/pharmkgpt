34905731|a|Blood reperfusion of ischemic cerebral tissue may cause cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (CIR) injury. Necroptosis and inflammation have been demonstrated to be involved in the disease-related process of CIR injury. The E3 ubiquitin ligase carboxyl terminus of Hsp70-interacting protein (CHIP) can modulate multiple cellular signaling processes, including necroptosis and inflammation. Numerous studies have demonstrated the neuroprotective effects of CHIP on multiple central nervous system (CNS) diseases. However, the effects of CHIP on CIR injury have not been fully explored. We hypothesize that CHIP can exert neuroprotective effects by attenuating necroptosis and inflammation during CIR injury. In the present study, adult wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 mice and CHIP knock-in (KI) mice with a C57BL/6 background and CHIP overexpression in neural tissue underwent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) surgery to simulate CIR onset. Our data indicated that CHIP expression in the peri-infarct tissue was markedly increased after MCAO surgery. Compared with WT mice, CHIP KI mice significantly improved neurological deficit scores, decreased cerebral infarct volume, and attenuated brain edema and neuronal damage. Meanwhile, CHIP overexpression attenuated necroptosis and inflammation induced by MCAO surgery. These findings indicated that overexpression of CHIP might exert neuroprotective effects by attenuating necroptosis and inflammation during CIR injury, and increasing CHIP levels may be a potential strategy in cerebrovascular disease therapy.
