33208187|t|Peripheral vascular disease - a new vascular disease associated with normal tension glaucoma: a case report.
33208187|a|INTRODUCTION: Normal-tension glaucoma is known as a multifactorial optic neuropathy. A number of lines of evidence suggested that vascular factors played a significant role in the development of normal-tension glaucoma. The mechanisms underlying the abnormal ocular blood flow in normal-tension glaucoma are still not clear. Peripheral vascular disease seems to be associated with glaucoma populations independent of other cardiovascular risk factors. We found this presentation, for the first time, to our knowledge, as another probable vascular abnormality related to our patient with normal-tension glaucoma, although it is necessary to confirm its pathological effect in future studies. CASE PRESENTATION: Our patient was a 48-year-old Spanish man without any personal and family history of interest except for circulatory problems of the lower limbs with repetitive ulcers at the frontal and lateral aspects of his legs. His chief complaint was vision loss when he came to consult us. In exploration, his best corrected visual acuity was 20/20 in both eyes; initial intraocular pressure in the right eye was 14-16 mmHg and in the left eye was 16-18 mmHg, with a mild sclerosis of the lens in slit-lamp examination. No inflammation or pigmented lesion was detected in the anterior chamber. Open angle confirmed by Goldman four quadrants gonioscopy. Funduscopic examination revealed a vertical cup disc ratio of 0.6 in the right eye and 0.8 in the left eye. The patient's neuroretinal rim was normal in the right eye, and superior thinning in the left eye was determined. Examination of the patient's visual field showed inferior mild probable nasal scotoma in the right eye and an inferior deep arcuate scotoma defect in the left eye. His optical coherence tomography examination revealed thinning of the peripapillary nerve fiber layer thickness in the left eye and superior loss of macular retinal ganglion cells in the left eye. Normal intraocular pressure values were measured on the intraocular pressure curve without treatment (maximum value, 18-20 mmHg), discarding higher intraocular pressures measured out of office. Ultrasonic pachymetry measured 515/520 mum, and normal intraocular pressure measured with a PASCAL tonometer ruled out probable corneal biomechanical underestimations. The patient's polysomnography study was normal and excluded sleep apnea syndrome. The patient's serial mean blood pressure was normal, especially in the lower limbs (mean value, 125/70 mmHg), ruling out the possibility of systemic hypotension. Thyroidal and coagulation abnormalities, autoimmune disease, and inflammatory disease were excluded. Normal immunologic study and normal vascular biopsy were observed, as well as normal brain magnetic resonance imaging and a normal carotid vascular study. The primary diagnosis was moderate medium peripheral arterial disease in the lower limbs, which was confirmed by echography after ruling out other probable vascular abnormalities related to normal-tension glaucoma. CONCLUSION: After ruling out other systemic diseases and vascular abnormalities related to normal-tension glaucoma, we found peripheral arterial disease as a probable vascular abnormality related to normal-tension glaucoma in our patient. To our knowledge, this is the first time such a case has been reported. Thus, further research is needed to determine the relevance of these results to the general population.
