32235426|t|Zinc Adequacy Is Essential for the Maintenance of Optimal Oral Health.
32235426|a|Zinc, a metal found in the Earth's crust, is indispensable for human health. In the human body, around 60% of zinc is present in muscles, 30% in bones, and the remaining 10% in skin, hair, pancreas, kidneys and plasma. An adequate zinc balance is essential for the maintenance of skeletal growth, development and function. It is also necessary for basic cellular functions including enzyme activation, cell signaling and energy metabolism. Inadequate zinc status is associated with a wide variety of systemic disorders including cardiovascular impairment, musculoskeletal dysfunctions and oromaxillary diseases. In this article, we briefly discuss the role of zinc deficiency in the genesis of various oromaxillary diseases, and explain why adequate zinc homeostasis is vital for the maintenance of oral and general health.
