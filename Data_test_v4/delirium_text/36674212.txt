36674212|t|Microarray Profiling of Differentially Expressed Genes in Coronary Artery Bypass Grafts of High-Risk Patients with Postoperative Cognitive Dysfunctions.
36674212|a|Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is cognitive decline after surgery. The authors hypothesized that gene-level changes could be involved in the pathogenesis of POCD. The present study evaluated the incidence of POCD and its associated differentially expressed genes. This was a prospective cohort study conducted on high-risk coronary artery bypass graft patients aged 40 to 75 years. POCD classification was based on a one standard deviation decline in the postoperative scores compared to the preoperative scores. The differentially expressed genes were identified using microarray analysis and validated using quantitative RT-PCR. Forty-six patients were recruited and completed the study. The incidence of POCD was identified using a set of neurocognitive assessments and found to be at 17% in these high-risk CABG patients. Six samples were selected for the gene expression analyses (3 non-POCD and 3 POCD samples). The findings showed five differentially expressed genes in the POCD group compared to the non-POCD group. The upregulated gene was ERFE, whereas the downregulated genes were KIR2DS2, KIR2DS3, KIR3DL2, and LIM2. According to the results, the gene expression profiles of POCD can be used to find potential proteins for POCD diagnostic and predictive biomarkers. Understanding the molecular mechanism of POCD development will further lead to early detection and intervention to reduce the severity of POCD, and hence, reduce the mortality and morbidity rate due to the condition.
