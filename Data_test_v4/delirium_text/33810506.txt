33810506|t|Genetic Neuropathy Due to Impairments in Mitochondrial Dynamics.
33810506|a|Mitochondria are dynamic organelles capable of fusing, dividing, and moving about the cell. These properties are especially important in neurons, which in addition to high energy demand, have unique morphological properties with long axons. Notably, mitochondrial dysfunction causes a variety of neurological disorders including peripheral neuropathy, which is linked to impaired mitochondrial dynamics. Nonetheless, exactly why peripheral neurons are especially sensitive to impaired mitochondrial dynamics remains somewhat enigmatic. Although the prevailing view is that longer peripheral nerves are more sensitive to the loss of mitochondrial motility, this explanation is insufficient. Here, we review pathogenic variants in proteins mediating mitochondrial fusion, fission and transport that cause peripheral neuropathy. In addition to highlighting other dynamic processes that are impacted in peripheral neuropathies, we focus on impaired mitochondrial quality control as a potential unifying theme for why mitochondrial dysfunction and impairments in mitochondrial dynamics in particular cause peripheral neuropathy.
