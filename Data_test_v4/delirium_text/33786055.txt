33786055|a|BACKGROUND: The present study aimed to control mebendazole drug release from ethyl cellulose nanofibers containing guar gum produced by Electrospinning Method (ESM) on mortality of hydatid cyst protoscoleces under laboratory conditions. METHODS: The study was conducted in Arak Islamic Azad University, 2019. After preparation of ethyl cellulose nanofibers containing guar gum with concentrations 10, 250, 50 and 500 ppm with ESM, the uniformity and fineness of nanofibers were investigated by electron microscope. By determining the absorption of nanofibers during 312 h via spectrophotometry method, the amount of drug release was obtained. Then, the mortality of live protoscoleces in-vitro with nanofibers made with different concentrations was studied during 13 days. RESULTS: Guar gum nanofiber with four concentrations of 10, 50, 250 and 500 ppm had 0.78512, 0.83729, 1.0098 and 1.0633 absorption respectively and showed drug release 42.09%, 39.95%, 33.05% and 30.96% after 312 hours. Therefore, the survival of protoscoleces in the presence of guar gum with four concentrations was zero after 3, 6, 11 and 13 days (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: To produce nanofibers carrying the drug for research related to the treatment of hydatid cysts, the electrospinning technique can be considered as a reliable method.
