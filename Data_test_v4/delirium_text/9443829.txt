9443829|a|Cholinergic neurons of the septum are preferentially subject to degeneration in Alzheimer's disease. There is evidence that nerve growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor, insulin-like growth factors, and estrogen all have effects on survival of this specific population of neurons at risk. We used a bilaminar culturing method to grow embryonic septal neurons from the rat in the presence of a separate glial plane but in the absence of serum. These neurons were treated with a number of factors, and neurite development of cholinergic neurons was assessed. Basic fibroblast growth factor and estrogen altered the number of primary neurites, number of secondary neurites, and mean total neurite lengths, while none of the other factors affected these end points. This would suggest a mechanism for the effects of these factors on memory.
