We sought to elucidate brain regions associated with olfactory dysfunction in patients with MCI and early AD by using 123I-IMP-SPECT to detect regional cerebral blood flow (CBF). METHODS: We included 218 patients diagnosed with AD or MCI, who underwent a comprehensive battery of neuropsychiatric and neuropsychological tests, Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Part (ADAS-Cog), and forward- and backward-digit span. Olfactory function was assessed using T&T olfactometry of five odors; patients stated whether they experienced any smell (detection test) and identified the odor (identification test). The association between single-photon emission computerized tomography based regional CBF and olfactory function was examined by voxel-by-voxel multiple regression analysis, considering sex, age, and education as covariate parameters. RESULTS: Of the 218 patients, 78 had mildly impaired olfactory detection and 15 had olfactory detection loss; additionally, 213 had mild olfactory identification impairment. The odor detection score correlated significantly with the ADAS-Cog word recall score (r = 0.193, p = 0.004). The odor identification score correlated significantly with the ADAS memory (r = 0.408, p < 0.001) and ADAS orientation (r = 0.292, p < 0.001) scores. The odor identification score correlated negatively with CBF in the left temporal pole, entorhinal area, and bilateral frontal poles (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Olfactory identification dysfunction in patients with MCI and AD is attributable to reduced CBF of the left temporal pole, entorhinal area, and bilateral frontal pole.
