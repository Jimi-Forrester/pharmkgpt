8866678|a|Down syndrome (DS) subjects develop Alzheimer disease (AD) histopathology before they develop dementia. We compared the resting and flash stimulated electroencephalogram (EEG) of nondemented adult DS and age-matched control subjects, in search of EEG abnormalities that might correlate with AD histopathology. DS subjects had increased absolute power in all the EEG bands, independent of cognition functions measured by the Mini Mental State Examination and Picture Absurdities Test scores. In the power spectrum of the resting EEG, we found a cognition-related increase in power at 4.5 and 8.8 Hz, indicative of alpha-slowing, as in AD patients. In the stimulated EEG, we found several cognition-related abnormalities, such as decreased responses to 12-Hz stimulation and decreased integral of beta- and gamma-band responses, indicative of decreased responsiveness to photic stimulation, as in AD patients. Therefore, nondemented DS and AD patients share several cognition related EEG abnormalities which are probably due to AD histopathology.
