8916142|a|Advanced glycation end-products (AGE) are formed in the late phase of the non-enzymatic glycosylation reaction in conditions such as diabetes mellitus and aging. In amyloidosis, AGE have been found in the A beta 2M amyloid associated with long-term hemodialysis and in the beta-protein in Alzheimer's disease. Murine AApoAII and AA amyloidosis were examined immunohistochemically using anti-AGE monoclonal antibody, 6D12. AApoAII amyloid deposits studied in one senescence-accelerated mouse P1 (SAMP1), congenic mice that have the amyloidogenic apolipoprotein A-II of SAMP1 mice, and AKR mice all reacted with biotinylated 6D12 by formic acid pretreatment, whereas AA amyloid deposits did not react with the antibody. The immunoreaction with anti-apolipoprotein A-II for amyloid deposits in senile mice was approximately homogeneous in intensity; on the other hand the reaction with biotinylated 6D12 was irregular in distribution and intensity over the amyloid deposits. These findings suggest that amyloid precursor proteins are not associated uniformly with AGE modification before deposition as amyloid; it is more likely that the AGE modification progresses gradually and unevenly after amyloid deposition. Murine amyloidosis may be a useful model to elucidate the role of AGE in amyloidosis.
