35207180|a|The cardiovascular system and the central nervous system (CNS) closely cooperate in the regulation of primary vital functions. The autonomic nervous system and several compounds known as cardiovascular factors, especially those targeting the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), the vasopressin system (VPS), and the oxytocin system (OTS), are also efficient modulators of several other processes in the CNS. The components of the RAS, VPS, and OTS, regulating pain, emotions, learning, memory, and other cognitive processes, are present in the neurons, glial cells, and blood vessels of the CNS. Increasing evidence shows that the combined function of the RAS, VPS, and OTS is altered in neuropsychiatric/neurodegenerative diseases, and in particular in patients with depression, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, autism, and schizophrenia. The altered function of the RAS may also contribute to CNS disorders in COVID-19. In this review, we present evidence that there are multiple causes for altered combined function of the RAS, VPS, and OTS in psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders, such as genetic predispositions and the engagement of the RAS, VAS, and OTS in the processes underlying emotions, memory, and cognition. The neuroactive pharmaceuticals interfering with the synthesis or the action of angiotensins, vasopressin, and oxytocin can improve or worsen the effectiveness of treatment for neuropsychiatric/neurodegenerative diseases. Better knowledge of the multiple actions of the RAS, VPS, and OTS may facilitate programming the most efficient treatment for patients suffering from the comorbidity of neuropsychiatric/neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases.
