31140638|t|Lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2: The story continues.
31140638|a|Inflammation is thought to play an important role in the pathogenesis of vascular diseases. Lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) mediates vascular inflammation through the regulation of lipid metabolism in blood, thus, it has been extensively investigated to identify its role in vascular inflammation-related diseases, mainly atherosclerosis. Although darapladib, the most advanced Lp-PLA2 inhibitor, failed to meet the primary endpoints of two large phase III trials in atherosclerosis patients cotreated with standard medical care, the research on Lp-PLA2 has not been terminated. Novel pathogenic, epidemiologic, genetic, and crystallographic studies regarding Lp-PLA2 have been reported recently, while novel inhibitors were identified through a fragment-based lead discovery strategy. More strikingly, recent clinical and preclinical studies revealed that Lp-PLA2 inhibition showed promising therapeutic effects in diabetic macular edema and Alzheimer's disease. In this review, we not only summarized the knowledge of Lp-PLA2 established in the past decades but also emphasized new findings in recent years. We hope this review could be valuable for helping researchers acquire a much deeper insight into the nature of Lp-PLA2, identify more potent and selective Lp-PLA2 inhibitors, and discover the potential indications of Lp-PLA2 inhibitors.
