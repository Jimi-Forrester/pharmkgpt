32548234|a|INTRODUCTION: Informal caregiving is an essential element of health-care delivery. Little data describes how caregivers structure care recipients' lives and impact their functional status. METHODS: We performed observational studies of community dwelling persons with dementia (PWD) to measure functional status by simultaneous assessment of physical activity (PA) and lifespace (LS). We present data from two caregiver/care-recipient dyads representing higher and average degrees of caregiver involvement. RESULTS: We acquired >42,800 (subject 1); >41,300 (subject 2) PA data points and >154,500 (subject 1); >119,700 (subject 2) LS data points over 15 months of near continuous observation. PA and LS patterns provided insights into the caregiver's role in structuring the PWD's day-to-day function and change in function over time. DISCUSSION: We show that device-enabled functional monitoring (FM) can successfully gather and display data at resolutions required for dementia care studies. Objective quantification of individual caregiver/care-recipient dyads provides opportunities to implement patient-centered care.
