37927935|t|Cachexia index as a prognostic predictor after resection of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.
37927935|a|Aim: This study was performed to investigate the relationship between the preoperative cachexia index (CXI) and long-term outcomes in patients who have undergone radical resection of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Methods: In total, 144 patients who underwent pancreatic resection for treatment of PDAC were retrospectively analyzed. The relationship between the CXI and the patients' long-term outcomes after PDAC resection was investigated. The CXI was calculated based on the preoperative skeletal muscle index, serum albumin level, and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio. After propensity-score matching, we compared clinicopathological features and outcomes. Results: The multivariate analysis showed that lymph node metastasis (hazard ratio [HR], 1.93; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.16-3.23; P = 0.0118), R1 resection (HR, 57.20; 95% CI, 9.39-348.30; P < 0.0001), and a low CXI (HR, 2.10; 95% CI, 1.27-3.46; P = 0.0038) were independent and significant predictors of disease-free survival (DFS) after PDAC resection. Moreover, a low CXI (HR, 3.14; 95% CI, 1.71-5.75; P = 0.0002) was an independent and significant predictor of overall survival (OS) after PDAC resection. After propensity-score matching, the low CXI group had a significantly worse prognosis than the high CXI group for both DFS and OS. Conclusion: The CXI can be a useful prognostic factor for DFS and OS after pancreatic resection for treatment of PDAC.
