38904550|a|Neurological disorders (NDs) are diseases that seriously affect the health of individuals worldwide, potentially leading to a significant reduction in the quality of life for patients and their families. Herbal medicines have been widely used in the treatment of NDs due to their multi-target and multi-pathway features. Ginkgo biloba leaves (GBLs), one of the most popular herbal medicines in the world, have been demonstrated to present therapeutic effects on NDs. However, the pharmacological mechanisms of GBLs in the treatment of neurological disorders have not been systematically summarized. This study aimed to summarize the molecular mechanism of GBLs in treating NDs from the cell models, animal models, and clinical trials of studies. Four databases, i.e., PubMed, Google Scholar, CNKI, and Web of Science were searched using the following keywords: "Ginkgo biloba", "Ginkgo biloba extract", "Ginkgo biloba leaves", "Ginkgo biloba leaves extract", "Neurological disorders", "Neurological diseases", and "Neurodegenerative diseases". All items meeting the inclusion criteria on the treatment of NDs with GBLs were extracted and summarized. Additionally, PRISMA 2020 was performed to independently evaluate the screening methods. Out of 1385 records in the database, 52 were screened in relation to the function of GBLs in the treatment of NDs; of these 52 records, 39 were preclinical trials and 13 were clinical studies. Analysis of pharmacological studies revealed that GBLs can improve memory, cognition, behavior, and psychopathology of NDs and that the most frequently associated GBLs are depression, followed by Alzheimer's disease, stroke, Huntington's disease, and Parkinson's disease. Additionally, the clinical studies of depression, AD, and stroke are the most common, and most of the remaining ND data are available from in vitro or in vivo animal studies. Moreover, the possible mechanisms of GBLs in treating NDs are mainly through free radical scavenging, anti-oxidant activity, anti-inflammatory response, mitochondrial protection, neurotransmitter regulation, and antagonism of PAF. This is the first paper to systematically and comprehensively investigate the pharmacological effects and neuroprotective mechanisms of GBLs in the treatment of NDs thus far. All findings contribute to a better understanding of the efficacy and complexity of GBLs in treating NDs, which is of great significance for the further clinical application of this herbal medicine.
