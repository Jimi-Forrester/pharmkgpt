39071825|t|Total Joint Arthroplasty and Sleep: The State of the Evidence.
39071825|a|Background: As the number of total hip and knee arthroplasties (TJA) performed increases, there is heightened interest in perioperative optimization to improve outcomes. Sleep is perhaps one of the least understood perioperative factors that affects TJA outcomes. The purpose of this article is to review the current body of knowledge regarding sleep and TJA and the tools available to optimize sleep perioperatively. Methods: A manual search was performed using PubMed for articles with information about sleep in the perioperative period. Articles were selected that examined: sleep and pain in the perioperative period; the effect of surgery on sleep postoperatively; the relationship between sleep and TJA outcomes; risk factors for perioperative sleep disturbance; the effect of anesthesia on sleep; and the efficacy of interventions to optimize sleep perioperatively. Results: Sleep and pain are intimately associated; poor sleep is associated with increased pain sensitivity. Enhanced sleep is associated with improved surgical outcomes, although transient sleep disturbances are normal postoperatively. Risk factors for perioperative sleep disturbance include increasing age, pre-existing sleep disorders, medical comorbidities, and type of anesthesia used. Interventions to improve sleep include optimizing medical comorbidities preoperatively, increasing sleep time perioperatively, appropriating sleep hygiene, using cognitive behavioral therapy, utilizing meditation and mindfulness interventions, and using pharmacologic sleep aids. Conclusions: Sleep is one of many factors that affect TJA. As we better understand the interplay between sleep, risk factors for suboptimal sleep, and interventions that can be used to optimize sleep, we will be able to provide better care and improved outcomes for patients.
