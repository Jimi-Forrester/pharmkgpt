28560384|a|Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has been demonstrated to have various effects on mitochondrial function. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of H2S on mitochondrial fission and the potential underlying mechanisms of these effects. Transmission electron microscopy analysis demonstrated that sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS, a donor of H2S) inhibited mitochondrial fission in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Treating neuro-2a (N2a) mouse neuroblastoma cells with 400 microM NaHS for 16 h significantly increased the % of elongated mitochondria and reduced the number of mitochondria per cell compared with untreated cells. In addition, the viability and ATP generation of N2a cells that were treated with various concentrations of NaHS was examined. The results demonstrated that treatment with 400 and 600 microM NaHS increased cell viability and ATP generation compared with untreated cells. To further understand the effects of H2S on mitochondrial morphology, the protein and mRNA expression levels of dynamin 1 like (Dnm1l, also known as Drp1) were examined, and the results demonstrated that NaHS dose-dependently reduced Drp1 mRNA and protein levels, consistent with the mitochondrial morphology changes. To determine whether H2S affects mitochondrial morphology through Drp1 expression, Drp1 was overexpressed in N2a cells using a lentivirus encoding the Drp1 cDNA. It was observed that Drp1 overexpression reversed the effects of NaHS. Furthermore, NaHS promoted the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2, and the effects of NaHS on Drp1 expression were abolished by an ERK1/2 inhibitor (PD98059). The results of the present study indicate that the H2S-induced decrease in Drp1 mRNA and protein levels and mitochondrial fission may involve the ERK1/2 signaling pathway. The present study suggests that H2S may be used in the future as a potential therapeutic for diseases that may be mediated by abnormal mitochondria fragmentation, such as Alzheimer's disease.
