32947876|t|Prevalence of Swallowing and Eating Difficulties in an Elderly Postoperative Hip Fracture Population-A Multi-Center-Based Pilot Study.
32947876|a|Elderly patients operated for hip fracture are characterized by high age and high degree of comorbidity and need of care, factors previously found to be associated with swallowing and eating difficulties. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of swallowing and eating difficulties in an elderly postoperative hip fracture population and to identify factors associated with swallowing and eating difficulties. A cross-sectional multi-center pilot study was performed, including patients >=65 years, operated for hip fracture, and able to participate in a swallowing and eating assessment. A clinical assessment was conducted using Danish versions of the standardized tools Volume-Viscosity Swallow Test and Minimal Eating Observation Form-version II. Demographic data and clinical characteristics were examined. A total of 78 patients (mean age 81.4 years (SD 7.8), 30.8% male) were included. Swallowing and eating difficulties were present in 60 patients (77%). Swallowing and eating difficulties were significantly associated with living in a nursing home before hospital admission (p = 0.014), low habitual New Mobility Score (p = 0.018), and absence of cardiac comorbidity (p = 0.023). The results underline the importance of focusing on swallowing and eating difficulties in elderly patients operated for hip fracture to ensure effectivity and safety and optimize the prognosis for the patient.
