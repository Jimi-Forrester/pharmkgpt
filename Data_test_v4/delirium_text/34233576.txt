34233576|a|Accumulating evidence has unveiled the pivotal roles of N6-methyladenosine (m6A) in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD). However, there are not many researches to predict the prognosis of PAAD using m6A-related long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). Raw data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC), and the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx) were utilized to comprehensively analyze the expression and prognostic performances of 145 m6A-related lncRNAs in PAAD and to develop and validate a novel m6A-related multi-lncRNA prognostic signature (m6A-LPS) for PAAD patients. In total, 57 differentially expressed m6A-related lncRNAs with prognostic values were identified. Based on LASSO-Cox regression analysis, m6A-LPS was constructed and verified by using five-lncRNA expression profiles for TCGA and ICGC cohorts. PAAD patients were then divided into high- and low-risKBIE_A_1933868k subgroups with different clinical outcomes according to the median risk score; this was further verified by time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curves. Risk scores were significantly associated with clinical parameters such as histological grade and cancer status among PAAD patients. A nomogram consisting of risk score, grade, and cancer status was generated to predict the survival probability of PAAD patients, as also demonstrated by calibration curves. Discrepancies in cellular processes, signaling pathways, and immune status between the high- and low-risk subgroups were investigated by functional and single-sample gene set enrichment analyses. In conclusion, the novel m6A-LPS for PAAD patients was developed and validated, which might provide new insight into clinical decision-making and precision medicine.
