37151140|t|Inflammatory Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy: A Broad Clinical Spectrum.
37151140|a|Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is a common central nervous system (CNS) vasculopathy, which in some cases is associated with subacute encephalopathy, seizures, headaches, or strokes due to vascular inflammation directed against vascular amyloid accumulation. The pathological subtypes of inflammatory CAA include CAA-related inflammation (CAAri) with mostly perivascular lymphocytic infiltrates, or amyloid-beta (Abeta)-related angiitis (ABRA) with transmural granulomatous inflammation. CAAri and ABRA probably represent part of the spectrum of CNS vasculopathies, intermediate between CAA and primary CNS vasculitis, and they are closely related to Abeta-related imaging abnormalities and other manifestations of an inflammatory response directed against Abeta in the leptomeninges and cerebral parenchyma. As treatment strategies in Alzheimer's disease shift toward potentially effective antiamyloid immunotherapy, the incidence rate of inflammatory CAA (which is probably an underrecognized condition) is likely to increase. Its clinical features are varied and include subacute encephalopathy, behavioral symptoms, headaches, seizures, and focal neurological deficits, which necessitate a high degree of suspicion for this disorder that often responds to treatment. The recent definition of the typical clinical and radiological syndrome has increased its recognition and may eliminate the need for invasive histological sampling in at least some affected patients. Here we review the pathophysiology, clinical spectrum, and approach to diagnosis, and discuss illustrative cases that highlight the wide range of clinical presentations.
