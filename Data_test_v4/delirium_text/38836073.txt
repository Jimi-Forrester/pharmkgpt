38836073|t|Incidence of Postoperative Delirium among Elderly Patients after Elective Surgeries under Anesthesia in the Charity Services of the Philippine General Hospital.
38836073|a|Background: Due to the increasing number of elderly patients being referred to anesthesia for surgical procedures, there is a growing interest with regard to the incidence of postoperative delirium and its contributing factors. Objectives: The primary objective of this study is to determine the incidence of postoperative delirium in the charity elderly patients at the Philippine General Hospital (PGH). Methods: The incidence of postoperative delirium was assessed in an analytic prospective study conducted at the PGH among elderly patients undergoing elective surgeries. Through interviews and chart reviews, the collected data focused on baseline intellectual status, age, gender, ASA classification, level of education, comorbidities, vices, previous surgeries, maintenance medications, preoperative diagnostics, duration of surgery, duration of anesthesia, type of anesthetic technique, and pain scores at the recovery room and 24 hours postoperatively. Responses to the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (SPMSQ), the Preoperative and Postoperative assessment forms and the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) instrument were analyzed. Results: It was observed that there was a 2.5% incidence of postoperative delirium in the study population and among the risk factors assessed, polypharmacy and presence of moderate to severe pain scores on the first day following surgery were significant contributors in its occurrence. Conclusion: In this preliminary study, the incidence of postoperative delirium as well as the significant contributing factors were described. In succeeding investigations, it is recommended to extend the observation and follow-up periods.
