Mitochondrial enzyme alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (alpha-KGDHC) seems to play a dual-edged sword role in cytotoxic insult. Here, using succinyl phosphonate (SP), a specific alpha-KGDHC inhibitor, we aimed to examine its potential action on AD progression. METHODS: Male Wistar rats were assigned to two separate experiments. First, they were bilaterally microinjected into the dorsal CA1 area by amyloid-beta (Abeta)25-35 for four consecutive days. Seven days after the last injection, they were trained to acquire Morris Water Maze (MWM) task for three successive days when they were treated with SP after each training session. In the second experiment, SP was administered 30 min after the first Abeta microinjection and behavioral tests were performed one week after the last Abeta administration. The activity of glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH), and glutamine synthetase (GS), as key enzymes involved in glutamate-glutamine homeostasis and histological assays were evaluated in the hippocampi. RESULTS: Our behavioral results indicated that post-training SP treatment enhanced task acquisition but did not change memory performance in Abeta-treated rats. However, administration of SP at the time of Abeta injection precludes the deteriorative effect of Abeta and neuronal injury on both spatial learning and memory performances indicating its preventive action against Abeta pathology at its early stages. Measurement of enzymes activity shows that alpha-KGDHC activity was reduced in the Abeta treated group, and SP administration restored its activity; also, GDH and GS activities were increased and decreased respectively due to Abeta, and SP reversed the action of Abeta on these enzymes. CONCLUSIONS: This study proposes that SP possibly a promising therapeutic approach to improve memory impairment in AD, especially in the early phases of this disease.
