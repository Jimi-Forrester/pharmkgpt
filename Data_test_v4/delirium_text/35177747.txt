35177747|a|No study has evaluated the effect of dexmedetomidine in patients who received surgery for type A aortic dissection. This is the first study to evaluate the effect of dexmedetomidine in aortic dissection patients. This study was executed using data from the Chang Gung Research Database in Taiwan. The CGRD contains the multi-institutional standardized electronic medical records from seven Chang Gung Memorial hospitals, the largest medical system in Taiwan. We retrospectively evaluate patients who received surgery for acute type A aortic dissection between January 2014 and December 2018. Overall, 511 patients were included, of whom 104 has received dexmedetomidine infusion in the postoperative period. One-to-two propensity score-matching yielded 86 cases in the dexmedetomidine group and 158 cases in the non-dexmedetomidine group. The in-hospital mortality and composite outcome including all-cause mortality, acute kidney injury, delirium, postoperative atrial fibrillation, and respiratory failure, were considered primary outcomes. The in-hospital mortality and composite outcome were similar between groups. The risk of Acute Kidney Injury Network stage 3 acute kidney injury was significantly lower in the dexmedetomidine group than in the non-dexmedetomidine group (8.1% vs 19.0%; OR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.17-0.86; p = 0.020. The risk of newly-onset dialysis was also significantly lower in the dexmedetomidine group than in the non-dexmedetomidine group (4.7% vs 13.3%; OR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.11-0.90; p = 0.031). Post-operative dexmedetomidine infusion significantly reduced the rate of severe acute kidney injury and newly-onset dialysis in patients who received surgery for acute type A aortic dissection.
