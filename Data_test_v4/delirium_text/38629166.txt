38629166|t|Recognition and Management of Delirium in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit: Case Series From a Single-Center Level IV Intensive Care Unit.
38629166|a|Delirium often goes unrecognized in neonates and children because of lack of experience in evaluating behavior and cognition, insufficient awareness of the prevalence, and nondistinctive symptoms in this population. Although there are increasing reports of the presence of delirium in neonates, there are little data to guide the pharmacologic treatment in this population. In this retrospective single-center case series, we present our experience using quetiapine to treat delirium in 9 medically complex neonates. Based on an extensive literature review, expert opinion, and institutional experience, we propose an approach for monitoring and treating delirium in neonates and infants.
