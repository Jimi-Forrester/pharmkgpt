37196573|t|Associations between cognitive function and a range of significant life events in an elderly essential tremor cohort study.
37196573|a|BACKGROUND: Although essential tremor (ET) is associated with cognitive decline, we know little about how specific cognitive changes predict significant events in patients' lives. We examined the relations of attention, executive function, language, memory, and visuospatial performance to the occurrence of near falls, falls, walking aid use, home health aide use, non-independent living and hospitalizations within a prospective, longitudinal study of ET cases. We expected executive function and memory to be most strongly associated with these events. METHODS: 131 ET cases (mean age at baseline = 76.4 +- 9.4 years; 109 normal cognition; 17 mild cognitive impairment, 5 demented) completed questionnaires (clinical history and occurrence of life events) and a battery of neuropsychological tests at baseline and at 18, 36, and 54 months. We assessed associations between cognitive functioning and outcomes via regression equations. RESULTS: Cases with lower baseline levels of executive function reported more near falls, p < 0.006, and were more likely to use a walking aid, p < 0.03, odds ratio (OR) = 2.89 during the follow-up period, than were other cases. Decline in executive function was associated with home health aide use during follow-up, p < 0.04, OR = 3.34. Baseline visuospatial performance also bore a marginally significant association with non-independent living arrangements during follow-up, p < 0.06, OR = 2.13. These effects were independent of age and tremor severity. CONCLUSION: These data establish the important role that cognitive decline, and executive function specifically, play in the experiences of ET patients. Moreover, these associations are of sufficient magnitude to have significant clinical implications.
