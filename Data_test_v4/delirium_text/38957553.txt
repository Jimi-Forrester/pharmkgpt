38957553|a|Aim: There is limited evidence regarding the feasibility of living-donor liver transplantation (LDLT) for patients aged over 70. The aims of this study were to assess postoperative outcomes in elderly recipients and to ascertain the potential feasibility and acceptability of LDLT. Methods: Data were collected from 762 recipients, including 26 in the elderly group (aged >=70) and 736 in the younger group (aged <70), and reviewed even by propensity score matching (PSM). Results: No significant differences were observed in the frequency of postoperative complications between the two groups. Additionally, both groups exhibited a comparable 30-day mortality rate after LDLT (3.9% in both) and similar hospital stays (36 days vs. 40 days). The 1-, 3-, and 5-year graft survival rates in the elderly group were 92.0%, which was comparable to those in the younger group (p = 0.517), as confirmed by PSM. Notably, all donors for elderly patients were the children of the recipients, with an average age of 41.6 years, and grafts from donors aged >=50 years were not utilized, signifying the use of high-quality grafts. Our inclusion criterion for elderly recipients was strictly defined as an ECOG-PS score of 0-2, which played a pivotal role in achieving favorable postoperative outcomes. Conclusion: LDLT can be performed safely for elderly patients aged 70 years or older, provided they have a preserved PS and receive high-quality grafts from younger donors, inevitably all children of elderly recipients. This approach yields acceptable long-term outcomes. Consequently, age alone should not serve as an absolute contraindication for LDLT.
