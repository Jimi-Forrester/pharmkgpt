38547819|t|Related factors of delirium after transsphenoidal endoscopic pituitary adenoma resection-A matched retrospective cohort study.
38547819|a|OBJECTIVES: The primary aim of this study is to explore the factors associated with delirium incidence in postoperative patients who have undergone endoscopic transsphenoidal approach surgery for pituitary adenoma. METHODS: The study population included patients admitted to Tianjin Huanhu Hospital's Skull Base Endoscopy Center from January to December 2022, selected through a retrospective cohort study design. The presence of perioperative delirium was evaluated using the 4 'A's Test (4AT) scale, and the final diagnosis of delirium was determined by clinicians. Statistical analysis included Propensity Score Matching (PSM), chi2 Test, and Binary Logistic Regression. RESULTS: A total of 213 patients were included in this study, and the incidence of delirium was found to be 29.58 % (63/213). Among them, 126 patients were selected using PSM (delirium:non-delirium = 1:1), ensuring age, gender, and pathology were matched. According to the results of univariate analysis conducted on multiple variables, The binary logistic regression indicated that a history of alcoholism (OR = 6.89, [1.60-29.68], P = 0.010), preoperative optic nerve compression symptoms (OR = 4.30, [1.46-12.65], P = 0.008), operation time >=3 h (OR = 5.50, [2.01-15.06], P = 0.001), benzodiazepines for sedation (OR = 3.94, [1.40-11.13], P = 0.010), sleep disorder (OR = 3.86, [1.40-10.66], P = 0.009), and physical restraint (OR = 4.53, [1.64-12.53], P = 0.004) as independent risk factors for postoperative delirium following pituitary adenoma surgery. CONCLUSIONS: For pituitary adenoma patients with a history of alcoholism and presenting symptoms of optic nerve compression, as well as an operation time >=3 h, enhancing communication between healthcare providers and patients, improving perioperative sleep quality, and reducing physical restraint may help decrease the incidence of postoperative delirium.
