35673257|t|Factors Influencing Trace Element Levels in the Blood of Tin Smelting Workers.
35673257|a|BACKGROUND: This study is to assess the correlation between blood concentration ranges of eight elements of tin smelting workers from Guangxi Liuzhou and their job type, working years, age, and sex. METHODS: We collected blood samples of 218 tin smelting workers from a Chinese tin smelting factory and determined the levels of elements by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Within the blood concentrations of eight metal elements of the objects, the blood concentration of copper and zinc is affected by the job type of comprehensive work; that of arsenic and mercury is affected by refining; and that of chromium, cadmium, and lead is affected by primary smelting. CONCLUSIONS: We present the remarkable influence of four job types on the blood concentration of seven trace elements.
