37194047|t|A blood-based composite panel that screens Alzheimer's disease.
37194047|a|BACKGROUND: Blood tests would be much easier to implement in the clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) as minimally invasive measurements. Multiple inspection technologies promoted AD-associated blood biomarkers' exploration. However, there was a lack of further screening and validation for these explored blood-based biomarkers. We selected four potential biomarkers to explore their plasma levels in AD and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and developed a composite panel for AD and aMCI screening. METHOD: The plasma concentrations of soluble low-density lipoprotein receptor-associated protein 1 (sLRP1), Gelsolin (GSN), Kallikrein 4 (KLK4) and Caspase 3 were measured in the discovery and validation cohort. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was generated to assess the classification panel with the area under the curve (AUC). RESULTS: A total of 233 participants (26 CN, 27 aMCI, and 26 AD in the discovery cohort, and 51 CN, 50 aMCI, and 53 AD in the validation cohort) with complete data were included in the study. The plasma concentrations of sLRP1 and Caspase 3 were significantly decreased in AD and aMCI when compared with those in the CN group. Compared with the CN group, the concentrations of KLK4 and GSN were increased in AD, but not in MCI. Interestingly, one of four proteins, sLRP1 in plasma level was higher in Apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon4 non-carriers than that in APOE epsilon4 carriers, especially among CN and MCI. No significant difference was found between females and males in the plasma levels of four proteins. The composite panel is based on four blood biomarkers accurately classifying AD from CN (AUC = 0.903-0.928), and MCI from CN (AUC = 0.846-0.865). Moreover, dynamic changes in the plasma levels of four proteins exhibited a significant correlation with cognitive assessment. CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, these findings indicate that the plasma levels of sLRP1, KLK4, GSN and Caspase 3 changed with the progression of AD. And their combination could be used to develop a panel for classifying AD and aMCI with high accuracy, which would provide an alternative approach for developing a blood-based test for AD and aMCI screening.
