36636607|t|Network Pharmacology Approach to Investigate the Mechanism of Danggui-Shaoyao-San against Diabetic Kidney Disease.
36636607|a|Background: Danggui-Shaoyao-San (DSS) is a traditional Chinese medicine formula that has been widely used to treat a variety of disorders, including renal diseases. Despite being well-established in clinical practice, the mechanisms behind the therapeutic effects of DSS on diabetic nephropathy (DN) remain elusive. Methods: To explore the therapeutic mechanism, we explored the action mechanism of DSS on DN using network pharmacology strategies. All ingredients were selected from the relevant databases, and active ingredients were chosen on the basis of their oral bioavailability prediction and drug-likeness evaluation. The putative proteins of DSS were obtained from the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology (TCMSP) database, whereas the potential genes of DN were obtained from the GeneCards and OMIM databases. Enrichment analysis using gene ontology (GO) and the Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) was performed to discover possible hub targets and gene-related pathways. Afterwards, the underlying molecular mechanisms of DSS against DN were validated experimentally in vivo against db/db mice. Results: We identified 91 phytochemicals using the comprehensive network pharmacology technique, 51 of which were chosen as bioactive components. There were 40 proteins and 20 pathways in the target-pathway network. The experimental validation results demonstrated that DSS may reduce the expression of TNF-alpha, IL-6, and ICAM-1, as well as extracellular matrix deposition, by blocking the JNK pathway activation, which protects against kidney injury. Conclusion: This study discovered the putative molecular mechanisms of action of DSS against diabetic kidney damage through a network pharmacology approach and experimental validation.
