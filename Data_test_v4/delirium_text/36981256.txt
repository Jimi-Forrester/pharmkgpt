36981256|t|Changes in the Quality of High-Oleic Sunflower Oil during the Frying of Shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei).
36981256|a|Shrimp fried in vegetable oil is a very popular food, so it is important to study the changes in the quality of the oil during frying. In order to more precisely study the nature of frying oil during the cooking process, this study investigated the quality changes of high-oleic sunflower oil during the frying of South American white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei). The oxidation and hydrolysis products of frying oils were investigated by integrating the proton nuclear magnetic resonance technique with traditional oil evaluation indexes in an integrated manner. The results showed that the color difference as measured using the DeltaE* value increased gradually during the process. Moreover, the acid value, carbonyl value, and total oxidation significantly increased with prolonged frying time. The major oxidation products formed during frying were (E,E)-2-alkenals, (E,E)-2,4-alkadienals, and E,E-conjugated hydroperoxides. This indicated that longer treatment times corresponded with an increased accumulation of aldehydes and ketones, and an increased degree of oxidative deterioration of the oil. However, the proportion of oleic acid in the frying oil increased with the frying of shrimp, reaching 80.05% after 24 h. These results contribute to our understanding of the oxidative deterioration of high-oleic oils during frying, and provide an important reference for the application properties of high-oleic oils.
