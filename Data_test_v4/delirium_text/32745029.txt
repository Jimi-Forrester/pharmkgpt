32745029|t|Prevention as Intervention: Reducing Incident Delirium in Heart Failure.
32745029|a|BACKGROUND: Delirium, an acute confusional state, is a health problem complicating the course of illness of hospitalized and ICU patients, including acute decompensated heart failure patients. The use of prevention protocols will necessitate education of clinicians, as an interdisciplinary team is developed. OBJECTIVE: Assess the impact of a 1-hour lecture and PowerPoint educational program on delirium and prevention protocols on nurses' knowledge. METHODS: A literature review was conducted on delirium risk in heart failure, prevention, and education. Nurses participated in a 1-hour nursing educational intervention on delirium prevention using lecture and PowerPoint. RESULTS: Results demonstrated a statistically significant difference between the means of the pre- and post- assessment scores, t (19) = 5.29, p = .00004 <   = 0.05. McNemar's tests showed statistically significant differences in the in the pre- and post- assessment questions numbered 1, p = 0.001 and 3, p = 0.031. CONCLUSIONS: Effective education, driven by the severity of outcomes and high healthcare costs, will increase nursing knowledge of delirium prevention, thereby permitting nurses to tailor delirium prevention strategies consistent with high-quality nursing care. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Nurses, who are equipped to tailor individual prevention strategies, will be strong advocates for the safety, mental and physical health of heart failure patients.
