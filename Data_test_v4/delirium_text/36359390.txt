36359390|t|Beta-Boswellic Acid Reverses 3-Nitropropionic Acid-Induced Molecular, Mitochondrial, and Histopathological Defects in Experimental Rat Model of Huntington's Disease.
36359390|a|Huntington's disease (HD) is distinguished by a triple repeat of CAG in exon 1, an increase in poly Q in the Htt gene, and a loss of GABAergic medium spiny neurons (MSN) in the striatum and white matter of the cortex. Mitochondrial ETC-complex dysfunctions are involved in the pathogenesis of HD, including neuronal energy loss, synaptic neurotrophic decline, neuronal inflammation, apoptosis, and grey and white matter destruction. A previous study has demonstrated that beta Boswellic acid (beta-BA), a naturally occurring phytochemical, has several neuroprotective properties that can reduce pathogenic factors associated with various neurological disorders. The current investigation aimed to investigate the neuroprotective potential of beta-BA at oral doses of 5, 10, and 15 mg/kg alone, as well as in conjunction with the potent antioxidant vitamin E (8 mg/kg, orally) in 3-NP-induced experimental HD rats. Adult Wistar rats were separated into seven groups, and 3-NP, at a dose of 10 mg/kg, was orally administered to each group of adult Wistar rats beginning on day 1 and continuing through day 14. The neurotoxin 3-NP induces neurodegenerative, g, neurochemical, and pathological alterations in experimental animals. Continuous injection of 3-NP, according to our results, aggravated HD symptoms by suppressing ETC-complex-II, succinate dehydrogenase activity, and neurochemical alterations. beta-BA, when taken with vitamin E, improved behavioural dysfunctions such as neuromuscular and motor impairments, as well as memory and cognitive abnormalities. Pharmacological treatments with beta-BA improved and restored ETC complexes enzymes I, II, and V levels in brain homogenates. beta-BA treatment also restored neurotransmitter levels in the brain while lowering inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress biomarkers. beta-BA's neuroprotective potential in reducing neuronal death was supported by histopathological findings in the striatum and cortex. As a result, the findings of this research contributed to a better understanding of the potential role of natural phytochemicals beta-BA in preventing neurological illnesses such as HD.
