35439990|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis is associated with amyloid-beta (Abeta)-induced neuroinflammation. In AD, the activation of microglia caused by Abeta accumulation is followed by the synthesis and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha), and ultimately leads to cognitive impairments. Clausena harmandiana (CH) is a medicinal plant in the Rutaceae family and has been used in folk medicine to relieve illnesses such as stomachache and headache, and as a health tonic. Interestingly, CH root extract (CHRE) has several anti-inflammatory and other pharmacological activities, but there are no studies in AD-like animal models. OBJECTIVES: This study aims to evaluate the effects of CHRE on cognitive impairments, increased Abeta1-42 protein levels, and neuroinflammation in Abeta1-42-induced rats. METHODS: Forty-eight adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (250-300 g) were randomly divided into 6 groups (n = 8) of the sham control, V + Abeta, CB + Abeta CHRE125 + Abeta, CHRE250 + Abeta, and CHRE500 + Abeta. Sodium carboxymethylcellulose, Celebrex (10 mg/kg BW) and CHRE (125, 250, and 500 mg/kg BW) were given orally or without any treatment for 35 days. On day 21, aggregated Abeta1-42 at a concentration of 1 mug/mul were injected into both lateral ventricles (1 mul/side) of all treated rats, while sterilized normal saline were injected to untreated rats. Ten days later, the novel object recognition test was performed to assess their recognition memory. At the end of the test period, an overdose of thiopental sodium (120 mg/kg BW) and transcardial perfusion with 0.9% normal saline solution were used to euthanize all rats. Then Abeta1-42 protein levels and the expression of inflammatory markers (CD11b-positive microglia, IL-1beta, and TNFalpha) were investigated in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. RESULTS: Pretreatment with CHRE at all doses could attenuate short- and long-term impairments in recognition memory. Additionally, CHRE also inhibited the increase of Abeta1-42 protein levels and the expression of inflammatory markers in both brain regions as well as receiving Celebrex. CONCLUSIONS: This suggests that preventive treatment of CHRE might be a potential therapy against cognitive impairments via reducing Abeta1-42 protein levels and neuroinflammation caused by Abeta1-42.
