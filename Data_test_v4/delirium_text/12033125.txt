12033125|a|The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a nursing and medical intervention programme for the prevention and treatment of delirium in elderly patients treated for femoral neck fractures. Forty-nine patients consecutively admitted to an orthogeriatric rehabilitation unit in a county hospital in northern Sweden were compared with historical cohorts of corresponding patients in the same and other hospitals. There was a total reorganization of nursing and medical care of patients with femoral neck fractures. The intervention programme consisted of staff education, co-operation between orthopaedic surgeons and geriatricians, individual care and planning of rehabilitation, improved ward environment, active nutrition, improved continuity of care and prevention and treatment of complications associated with delirium. The main result of the study was that the incidence of delirium was significantly lower than in all previously published studies. The incidence of other postoperative complications was also lower, and a larger proportion of the patients regained independent walking ability and could return to their previous living conditions on discharge. It can be concluded that the intervention programme reduced the incidence and duration of delirium and improved functional outcome for elderly patients treated for femoral neck fractures.
