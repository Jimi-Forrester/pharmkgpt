39394603|t|Investigating the effects of indoor lighting on measures of brain health in older adults: protocol for a cross-over randomized controlled trial.
39394603|a|BACKGROUND: The worldwide number of adults aged 60 years and older is expected to double from 1 billion in 2019 to 2.1 billion by 2050. As the population lives longer, the rising incidence of chronic diseases, cognitive disorders, and behavioral health issues threaten older adults' health span. Exercising, getting sufficient sleep, and staying mentally and socially active can improve quality of life, increase independence, and potentially lower the risk for Alzheimer's disease or other dementias. Nonpharmacological approaches might help promote such behaviors. Indoor lighting may impact sleep quality, physical activity, and cognitive function. Dynamically changing indoor lighting brightness and color throughout the day has positive effects on sleep, cognitive function, and physical activity of its occupants. The aim of this study is to investigate how different indoor lighting conditions affect such health measures to promote healthier aging. METHODS: This protocol is a randomized, cross-over, single-site trial followed by an exploratory third intervention. Up to 70 older adults in independent living residences at a senior living facility will be recruited. During this 16-week study, participants will experience three lighting conditions. Two cohorts will first experience a static and a dynamic lighting condition in a cluster-randomized cross-over design. The static condition lighting will have fixed brightness and color to match lighting typically provided in the facility. For the dynamic condition, brightness and color will change throughout the day with increased brightness in the morning. After the cross-over, both cohorts will experience another dynamic lighting condition with increased morning brightness to determine if there is a saturation effect between light exposure and health-related measures. Light intake, sleep quality, and physical activity will be measured using wearable devices. Sleep, cognitive function, mood, and social engagement will be assessed using surveys and cognitive assessments. DISCUSSION: We hypothesize participants will have better sleep quality and greater physical activity during the dynamic lighting compared to the static lighting condition. Additionally, we hypothesize there is a maximal threshold at which health-outcomes improve based on light exposure. Study findings may identify optimal indoor lighting solutions to promote healthy aging for older adults. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05978934.
