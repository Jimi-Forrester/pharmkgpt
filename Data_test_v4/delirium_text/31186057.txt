31186057|t|Sublingual microcirculation: a case report.
31186057|a|INTRODUCTION: Sublingual microcirculation monitoring is suitable for bedside use in critically ill patients. We present a case in which severely impaired sublingual microcirculation was the first alarming sign of an early deterioration of the patient's medical situation. CASE PRESENTATION: This is the case of a 58-year-old white woman admitted to our intensive care unit after the removal of parts of her small intestine due to a volvulus. Her microcirculation was checked the day after surgery in terms of an ongoing study and predicted a massive deterioration of her clinical situation. CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights the potential value of monitoring the microcirculation in critically ill patients. Two full hours could have been saved for diagnostic workup and earlier treatment had we considered the impaired microcirculation alone as a warning sign. Regardless of the supposed cause, impaired microcirculation should alert the responsible physician and should be followed by a diagnostic workup. Sublingual microcirculation monitoring can be useful in intensive care units to detect a deteriorated microcirculation earlier than with standard monitoring.
