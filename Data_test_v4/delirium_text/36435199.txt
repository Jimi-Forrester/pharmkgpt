36435199|t|IFITM proteins: Understanding their diverse roles in viral infection, cancer, and immunity.
36435199|a|Interferon-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) are broad spectrum antiviral factors that inhibit the entry of a wide range of clinically important pathogens including influenza A virus, HIV-1, and Dengue virus. IFITMs are thought to act primarily by antagonizing virus-cell membrane fusion in this regard. However, recent work on these proteins has uncovered novel post-entry viral restriction mechanisms. IFITMs are also increasingly thought to have a role regulating immune responses, including innate antiviral and inflammatory responses as well as adaptive T-cell and B-cell responses. Further, IFITMs may have pathological activities in cancer, wherein IFITM expression can be a marker of therapeutically resistant and aggressive disease courses. In this review, we summarize the respective literatures concerning these apparently diverse functions with a view to identifying common themes and potentially yielding a more unified understanding of IFITM biology.
