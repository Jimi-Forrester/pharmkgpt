3541046|a|Dementia of Alzheimer type is not form of accelerated aging. Blood flow, oxygen consumption and glucose utilization of the normally aged brain are maintained unchanged from the 3rd to the 7th decade of life. Thereafter, these parameters may decrease. Brain blood flow and oxidative metabolism is reduced in dementia of Alzheimer type and thus is different from the aged-matched mentally healthy subjects. There is evidence that the predominant impairment among these parameters may occur in cerebral glucose metabolism. This disturbance may precede changes in cerebral oxygen consumption and blood flow. Cerebral hypometabolism of glucose is accentuated in the temporo-parietal cortex. This finding may be helpful in diagnosing dementia of Alzheimer type.
