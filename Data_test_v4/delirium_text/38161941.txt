38161941|t|Vitamin D and Cardiovascular Diseases: An Update.
38161941|a|Vitamin D is a vital nutrient that plays a significant part in several physiological processes within the human body, including calcium metabolism, bone health, immune function, and cell growth and differentiation. It is obtained mainly through exposure to sunlight but can be acquired from certain foods and supplements as well. Vitamin D deficiency (VDD) could be the risk factor for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), such as heart disease and stroke. In blood vitamin D low levels have been linked with an enhanced risk of developing CVDs. However, it is unclear whether vitamin D levels are the leading cause or consequence of these conditions. While some studies highlight that taking vitamin D supplements could decrease the risk of CVD; however, more research is required to better understand the association between vitamin D and cardiovascular health. In this review, we aimed to summarize the currently available evidence supporting the association between vitamin D and CVDs and anesthesia considerations.
