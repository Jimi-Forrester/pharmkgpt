37211175|t|Neurogenomics of Alzheimer's Disease (AD): An Asian Population Review.
37211175|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is on the rise worldwide. Generally, AD is considered neurodegenerative when the production and clearance of amyloid-beta (Abeta) are imbalanced. Recent research on genome-wide association studies (GWAS) has been explosive; GWAS indicates a relationship between single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and AD. GWAS also reveals ethnic differences between Caucasians and Asians. This indicates that pathogenesis between ethnic groups is distinct. According to current scientific knowledge, AD is a disease with a complex pathogenesis that includes impaired neuronal cholesterol regulation, immunity regulation, neurotransmitters regulation, Abeta clearance, Abeta production, and vascular regulation. Here, we demonstrate the pathogenesis of AD in an Asian population and the SNP risk of AD for future AD screening before onset. According to our knowledge, this is the first review of Alzheimer's disease to demonstrate the pathogenesis of AD based on SNP in an Asian population.
