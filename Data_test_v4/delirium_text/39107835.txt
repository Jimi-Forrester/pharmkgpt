39107835|t|Tau in neurodegenerative diseases: molecular mechanisms, biomarkers, and therapeutic strategies.
39107835|a|The deposition of abnormal tau protein is characteristic of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and a class of neurodegenerative diseases called tauopathies. Physiologically, tau maintains an intrinsically disordered structure and plays diverse roles in neurons. Pathologically, tau undergoes abnormal post-translational modifications and forms oligomers or fibrous aggregates in tauopathies. In this review, we briefly introduce several tauopathies and discuss the mechanisms mediating tau aggregation and propagation. We also describe the toxicity of tau pathology. Finally, we explore the early diagnostic biomarkers and treatments targeting tau. Although some encouraging results have been achieved in animal experiments and preclinical studies, there is still no cure for tauopathies. More in-depth basic and clinical research on the pathogenesis of tauopathies is necessary.
