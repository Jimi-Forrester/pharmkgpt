2284375|t|Application of Piagetian measures of cognition in severe Alzheimer's disease.
2284375|a|Conventional psychometric measures uniformly yield zero or near zero scores (i.e., "bottom-out") as patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) progress to the more severe stages of the illness. Consequently, there are no psychometric measures which objectively assess the mental abilities of AD patients with very severe cognitive impairment. We explored the hypothesis that mental function in AD patients with very severe cognitive impairment can be effectively assessed using test measures developed to assess the earliest stage of cognitive development as proposed by Piaget. We also investigated the relationship between decline on these experimental cognitive measures and progressive functional disability in patients with severe cognitive impairment. The results indicate that modified instruments derived from measures developed to assess Piaget's sensorimotor stage of cognitive development provide useful information about the cognitive abilities of very severely impaired AD patients. These modified instruments provide a measure of cognition in these extremely impaired patients that has acceptable validity and demonstrable reliability.
