39061379|t|New Perspectives of Deep Brain Stimulation Indications for Parkinson's Disease: A Critical Review.
39061379|a|Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is an effective treatment option for patients with dopaminergic complications of Parkinson's disease (PD) and drug-refractory PD tremor. However, DBS and its indications can be challenging, and they are not often debated in the medical community. Through a critical narrative review, the objective of this paper is to improve the comprehension of DBS indications and help to solve the puzzle that this process can be. Proper patient selection is the first step for a good surgical outcome. In this review, then, relevant considerations are discussed, involving PD genes, PD phenotypes, indications of early stages, non-motor symptoms, neuroimaging predictors, comorbidities, and age. Individualized approaches are encouraged, including clinical and radiological factors. Social support during the whole follow-up and expectations alignment are necessary through this process and are also debated.
