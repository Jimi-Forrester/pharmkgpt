30413359|t|Single-Blinded Randomized Controlled Study on Use of Interactive Distraction Versus Oral Midazolam to Reduce Pediatric Preoperative Anxiety, Emergence Delirium, and Postanesthesia Length of Stay.
30413359|a|PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to compare effects of tablet-based interactive distraction (TBID; 1 minute preseparation) with oral midazolam (15 to 45 minutes of preseparation) on preoperative anxiety, emergence delirium, and postanesthesia length of stay in children, 4 to 12 years undergoing outpatient surgery. DESIGN: Single-blinded prospective design with randomized assignment to TBID or oral midazolam group was conducted at a large pediatric hospital in southwestern United States. METHODS: A total of 102 children and caregivers were enrolled. Outcome measures included anxiety scores at baseline, separation, and mask induction; postemergence delirium scores; caregiver ratings of child anxiety and satisfaction; and time from postanesthesia care unit arrival to discharge and posthospital behaviors. FINDINGS: The TBID group demonstrated significantly lower anxiety at separation and mask induction (P < .001) and emergence delirium at 15 minutes postawakening (P = .001), were extubated earlier (P = .007), arrived to phase II earlier (P = .03), and discharged earlier (P = .0001). CONCLUSIONS: TBID was more effective than oral midazolam in reducing preoperative anxiety, emergence delirium, and postanesthesia length of stay.
