39019626|a|OBJECTIVES: To assess the impact of a patient-based self-assessed fatigue intervention aimed at promoting early postoperative ambulation. DESIGN: Prospective randomised controlled trial. SETTING: Single-centre, conducted at the Obstetrics and Gynaecology Department of the Xiangyang Central Hospital, China. PARTICIPANTS: Eligible were adult patients undergoing elective gynaecologic oncologic surgery. INTERVENTIONS: The intervention group utilised a modified Borg Rating of Perceived Experience (RPE) scale for self-assessment of fatigue levels. The control group followed fixed-activity distance guidelines postoperatively. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the self-reported the time to first flatus postoperatively. Secondary outcomes encompassed the time to first defecation, incidence of moderate-to-severe abdominal distention, ileus, postambulation adverse events (nausea, vomiting and dizziness), patient satisfaction with early ambulation instructions, compliance with early ambulation and average hospital costs and length of stay. RESULTS: Between June 2021 and October 2022, 552 patients were enrolled. The self-assessed fatigue intervention group demonstrated non-inferior the time to first flatus compared with the fixed-activity distance assessment group (25.59+-14.59 hours vs 26.10+-14.19 hours, pnon-inferiority<0.001). Compliance with activity was higher in the intervention group (49.40% vs 36.02%, p<0.001), although it did not reach 50%. The intervention group also exhibited significantly higher mean hospital costs, length of stay and incidence of moderate-to-severe abdominal distention (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The self-assessed fatigue intervention for early postoperative ambulation in gynaecologic oncology patients shows promise as an effective strategy; however, compliance is suboptimal. An intervention based on mandatory, yet reasonable, fixed-activity distance may represent the most viable current approach. Further research is warranted to confirm these findings.
