32703424|a|Our previous reports demonstrated that the novel peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors alpha and gamma (PPARalpha/gamma) dual agonist propane-2-sulfonic acid octadec-9-enyl-amide (N15) alleviates cognitive ability in the chronic phase of ischemic stroke. However, the potential effects of N15 on Alzheimer's disease (AD) animal models have not been elucidated. In the present study, we investigated the effects of N15 on scopolamine-induced cognitive dysfunction and cholinergic system ability. N15 (50, 100 or 200 mg/kg) was administered to mice via oral gavage for 21 days, and spatial cognitive dysfunction was induced via an intraperitoneal injection of scopolamine (4 mg/kg) for 6 days. We found that N15 pretreatment markedly ameliorated scopolamine-induced spatial cognitive impairment and enhanced cholinergic system reactivity in the hippocampus. N15 pretreatment also significantly increased the expression levels of growth-associated protein-43, synaptophysin, brain-derived neurotrophic factor and neurotrophin-3 in the hippocampus. Our data demonstrate that N15 has an anti-amnesic effect, which may be mediated by enhancing cholinergic activity and synaptic plasticity. These findings support N15 as a potent neuropharmacological drug against AD.
