33600171|a|An interruption in Abeta homeostasis leads to the deposit of neurotoxic amyloid plaques and is associated with Alzheimer's disease. A supramolecular strategy based on the assembly of peptidomimetic agents into functional vesicles has been conceived for the simultaneous inhibition of Abeta42 fibrillation and expedited clearance of Abeta42 aggregates. Tris-pyrrolamide peptidomimetic, ADH-353, contains one hydrophobic N-butyl and two hydrophilic N-propylamine side chains and readily forms vesicles under physiological conditions. These vesicles completely rescue both mouse neuroblastoma N2a and human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells from the cytotoxicity that follows from Abeta42 misfolding likely in mitochondria. Biophysical studies, including confocal imaging, demonstrate the biocompatibility and selectivity of the approach toward this aberrant protein assembly in cellular milieu.
