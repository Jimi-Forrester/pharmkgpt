36998706|a|Poor cognitive ability is a consequence of a wide variety of neurobehavioral disorders and is a growing health problem, especially among the elderly and patients with diabetes. The precise underlying cause of this complication is not well-defined. However, recent studies have highlighted the possible role of insulin hormone signaling in brain tissue. Insulin is a metabolic peptide integral to whole body energy homeostasis; it does, however, have extrametabolic impacts, such as upon neuronal circuits. Therefore, it has been suggested that insulin signaling may modify cognitive ability by yet unknown pathways. In the current review, we discuss the cognitive role of brain insulin signaling and consider the possible links between brain insulin signaling and cognitive ability.
