35505662|a|Adeno-associated virus (AAV)-induced dorsal root ganglia (DRG) toxicity has been observed in several nonclinical species, where lesions are characterized by neuronal degeneration/necrosis, nerve fiber degeneration, and mononuclear cell infiltration. As AAV vectors become an increasingly common platform for novel therapeutics, non-invasive biomarkers are needed to better characterize and manage the risk of DRG neurotoxicity in both nonclinical and clinical studies. Based on biological relevance, reagent availability, antibody cross-reactivity, DRG protein expression, and assay performance, neurofilament light chain (NF-L) emerged as a promising biomarker candidate. Dose- and time-dependent changes in NF-L were evaluated in male Wistar Han rats and cynomolgus monkeys following intravenous or intrathecal AAV injection, respectively. NF-L profiles were then compared against microscopic DRG lesions on day 29 post-dosing. In animals exhibiting DRG toxicity, plasma/serum NF-L was strongly associated with the severity of neuronal degeneration/necrosis and nerve fiber degeneration, with elevations beginning as early as day 8 in rats (>=5 x 1013 vg/kg) and day 14 in monkeys (>=3.3 x 1013 vg/dose). Consistent with the unique positioning of DRGs outside the blood-brain barrier, NF-L in cerebrospinal fluid was only weakly associated with DRG findings. In summary, circulating NF-L is a promising biomarker of AAV-induced DRG toxicity in nonclinical species.
