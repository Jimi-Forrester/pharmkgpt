38611617|a|An improved understanding of the pathobiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) should lead ultimately to an earlier and more accurate diagnosis of AD, providing the opportunity to intervene earlier in the disease process and to improve outcomes. The known hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease include amyloid-beta plaques and neurofibrillary tau tangles. It is now clear that an imbalance between production and clearance of the amyloid beta protein and related Abeta peptides, especially Abeta42, is a very early, initiating factor in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis, leading to aggregates of hyperphosphorylation and misfolded tau protein, inflammation, and neurodegeneration. In this article, we review how the AD diagnostic process has been transformed in recent decades by our ability to measure these various elements of the pathological cascade through the use of imaging and fluid biomarkers. The more recently developed plasma biomarkers, especially phosphorylated-tau217 (p-tau217), have utility for screening and diagnosis of the earliest stages of AD. These biomarkers can also be used to measure target engagement by disease-modifying therapies and the response to treatment.
