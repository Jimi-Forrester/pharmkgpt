34733131|t|Increased Signal Delays and Unaltered Synaptic Input Pattern Recognition in Layer III Neocortical Pyramidal Neurons of the rTg4510 Mouse Model of Tauopathy: A Computer Simulation Study With Passive Membrane.
34733131|a|Abnormal tau proteins are involved in pathology of many neurodegenerative disorders. Transgenic rTg4510 mice express high levels of human tau protein with P301L mutation linked to chromosome 17 that has been associated with frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism. By 9 months of age, these mice recapitulate key features of human tauopathies, including presence of hyperphosphorylated tau and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in brain tissue, atrophy and loss of neurons and synapses, and hyperexcitability of neurons, as well as cognitive deficiencies. We investigated effects of such human mutant tau protein on neuronal membrane, subthreshold dendritic signaling, and synaptic input pattern recognition/discrimination in layer III frontal transgenic (TG) pyramidal neurons of 9-month-old rTg4510 mice and compared these characteristics to those of wild-type (WT) pyramidal neurons from age-matched control mice. Passive segmental cable models of WT and TG neurons were set up in the NEURON simulator by using three-dimensionally reconstructed morphology and electrophysiological data of these cells. Our computer simulations predict leakage resistance and capacitance of neuronal membrane to be unaffected by the mutant tau protein. Computer models of TG neurons showed only modest alterations in distance dependence of somatopetal voltage and current transfers along dendrites and in rise times and half-widths of somatic Excitatory Postsynaptic Potential (EPSPs) relative to WT control. In contrast, a consistent and statistically significant slowdown was detected in the speed of simulated subthreshold dendritic signal propagation in all regions of the dendritic surface of mutant neurons. Predictors of synaptic input pattern recognition/discrimination remained unaltered in model TG neurons. This suggests that tau pathology is primarily associated with failures/loss in synaptic connections rather than with altered intraneuronal synaptic integration in neurons of affected networks.
