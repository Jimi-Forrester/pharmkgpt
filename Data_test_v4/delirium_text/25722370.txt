25722370|a|In neural stem cells (NSCs), the balance between stem cell maintenance and neuronal differentiation depends on cell-fate determinants such as TRIM32. Previously, we have shown that TRIM32 associates with the RNA-induced silencing complex and increases the activity of microRNAs such as Let-7a. However, the exact mechanism of microRNA regulation by TRIM32 during neuronal differentiation has yet to be elucidated. Here, we used a mass spectrometry approach to identify novel protein-protein interaction partners of TRIM32 during neuronal differentiation. We found that TRIM32 associates with proteins involved in neurogenesis and RNA-related processes, such as the RNA helicase DDX6, which has been implicated in microRNA regulation. We demonstrate, that DDX6 colocalizes with TRIM32 in NSCs and neurons and that it increases the activity of Let-7a. Furthermore, we provide evidence that DDX6 is necessary and sufficient for neuronal differentiation and that it functions in cooperation with TRIM32.
