14520166|t|Suppression of alcohol delirium tremens by baclofen administration: a case report.
14520166|a|Delirium tremens (DT) is a clinical condition that appears in some patients affected by severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS). DT represents a serious complication, being characterized by elevated morbidity and mortality. Benzodiazepines are presently the drug of choice; however their use is related to several side effects. Baclofen is a stereoselective gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABAB) receptor agonist. Recent studies show that baclofen is able to suppress alcohol withdrawal symptoms. At present there are no data on the effects of baclofen administration in AWS complicated by DT. Here, we report a case of DT successfully treated with baclofen. This result indicates that the efficacy of baclofen in the treatment of DT should be examined in future clinical trials.
