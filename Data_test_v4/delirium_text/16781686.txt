16781686|a|The extracellular deposition of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) in brain parenchyma is one of the characteristic features of Alzheimer's disease and is suggested to induce reactive and degenerative changes in neuronal cell bodies, axons and dendritic processes. In particular, within and in close proximity to amyloid plaques, distinctive morphological alterations have been observed, including changes in neurite trajectory and decreases in dendritic diameter and in spine density. Apart from these plaque-associated focal aberrations, little is known regarding modifications of the global dendritic morphology including the detailed and comparative quantitative analysis of apical and basal arbors. The objective of the present study was to investigate the effects of amyloid plaque deposition and elevated soluble Abeta on neuronal morphology in mutant human amyloid precursor protein (hAPP) transgenic mice (line Tg2576; [K. Hsiao, P. Chapman, S. Nilsen, C. Eckman, Y. Harigaya, S. Younkin, F. Yang, G. Cole, Correlative memory deficits, Abeta elevation, and amyloid plaques in transgenic mice, Science 274 (1996) 99-102]). Retrogradelly labeled callosal-projecting pyramidal cells in the primary somatosensory cortex were three-dimensionally analyzed. Although basal dendrites remained unaffected, analysis of apical trees revealed a number of unambiguous morphological changes. Thus, in TG2576 mice, the apical arbors were shortened in total length and less branched. Furthermore, the diameter of proximal dendritic segments was increased whereas that of distal segments was reduced. Analysis of spine numbers and distribution on basal and apical trees demonstrated a significant reduction in spine densities along the whole course of dendrites. The findings suggest that Abeta-related pathology induces morphological aberrations in basal and apical arbors to different degrees which are unrelated to direct plaque-associated changes.
