39081420|a|The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the ensuing COVID-19 pandemic had far-reaching and multifaceted effects on global health. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the physical, extrapulmonary, and psychological manifestations associated with COVID-19. It highlights the wide-ranging impact of the virus on various organ systems, including the respiratory, cardiovascular, renal, gastrointestinal, ocular, dermatologic, and nervous systems. Additionally, it explores the complex connections between COVID-19 infection and neuropsychiatric symptoms, shedding light on the potential underlying mechanisms. The paper also delves into the phenomenon of "long COVID," a condition characterized by persistent symptoms extending well beyond the disease's acute phase. It discusses the diverse and often debilitating symptoms that individuals with long COVID may experience, encompassing physical, cognitive, and psychological aspects. The complexity and variability of long COVID underscore the challenges it poses to healthcare professionals and the importance of ongoing research to understand its underlying mechanisms. Furthermore, the paper touches on the current state of knowledge regarding the aetiology of long COVID and the various approaches to symptom management and treatment. While a definitive cure remains elusive, efforts are underway to alleviate the burden of long COVID through pharmacological interventions, physical therapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy, and support networks. This paper comprehensively explores COVID-19's far-reaching effects, emphasizing the need for a holistic and interdisciplinary approach to understanding and managing the diverse manifestations of this global health challenge. Ongoing research and collaborative efforts are essential in addressing the complex and evolving nature of COVID-19 and its aftermath.
