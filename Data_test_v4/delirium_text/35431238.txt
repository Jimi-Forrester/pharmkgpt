Evidence suggest that sex may differently influence the expression of proteins amyloid-beta (Abeta1-42) and tau, for which early detection is crucial in prevention of the disease. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the effect of aging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of Abeta1-42 and tau on frontal metabolites measured with proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) in a cohort of cognitively normal older women and women with MCI. METHODS: 3T single-voxel MRS was performed on the medial frontal cortex, using Point Resolved Spectroscopy (PRESS) and Mescher-Garwood Point Resolved Spectroscopy (MEGA-PRESS) in 120 women (age range 50-85). CSF samples of Abeta1-42 and tau and scores of general cognition were also obtained. RESULTS: Levels of frontal gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA+) were predicted by age, independently of disease and CSF biomarkers. Importantly, levels of GABA+ were reduced in MCI patients. Additionally, we found that levels of N-acetylaspartate relative to myo-inositol (tNAA/mI) predicted cognition in MCI patients only and were not related to CSF biomarkers. CONCLUSION: This study is the first to demonstrate a strong association between frontal GABA+ levels and neurological aging in a sample consisting exclusively of healthy older women with various levels of CSF tau and Abeta1-42 and women with MCI. Importantly, our results show no correlation between CSF biomarkers and MRS metabolites in this sample.
