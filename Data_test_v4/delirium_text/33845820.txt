33845820|a|BACKGROUND: Acute colonic pseudo-obstruction (ACPO) is a rare condition observed in patients with some underlying medical or surgical conditions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report of a patient with ACPO development and rapid septic progression after laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair. CASE PRESENTATION: A 78-year-old man who underwent transabdominal preperitoneal hernia repair (TAPP) for right inguinal hernia presented with difficulty in defecation and abdominal distension. He visited our emergency department on the third postoperative day. Enhanced computed tomography (CT) detected marked enlargement from the cecum to the rectum. There was no evidence of mechanical obstruction, ischemia, or perforation. He was diagnosed with postoperative constipation and received conservative management. He gradually started to improve; however, he suddenly experienced cardiopulmonary arrest 30 h after admission and could not be resuscitated. CT imaging of the abdomen during autopsy did not show any significant change, such as perforation, from the time of admission. Based on the clinical course and examination results, postoperative ACPO was considered the fundamental cause of fulminant obstructive colitis leading to sepsis. CONCLUSIONS: ACPO following minimally invasive surgery is exceedingly rare. However, it is important to consider this disease as one of the differential diagnoses to avoid missing the chance for advanced therapy.
