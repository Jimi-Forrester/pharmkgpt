25349919|a|The appearance of neuritic amyloid plaques comprised of beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) in the brain is a predominant feature in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the aggregation process, Abeta samples a variety of potentially toxic aggregate species, ranging from small oligomers to fibrils. Abeta has the ability to form a variety of morphologically distinct and stable amyloid fibrils. Commonly termed polymorphs, such distinct aggregate species may play a role in variations of AD pathology. It has been well documented that polymorphic aggregates of Abeta can be produced by changes in the chemical environment and peptide preparations. As Abeta and several of its aggregated forms are known to interact directly with lipid membranes and this interaction may play a role in a variety of potential toxic mechanisms associated with AD, we determine how different Abeta(1-40) preparation protocols that lead to distinct polymorphic fibril aggregates influence the interaction of Abeta(1-40) with model lipid membranes. Using three distinct protocols for preparing Abeta(1-40), the aggregate species formed in the absence and presence of a lipid bilayers were investigated using a variety of scanning probe microscopy techniques. The three preparations of Abeta(1-40) promoted distinct oligomeric and fibrillar aggregates in the absence of bilayers that formed at different rates. Despite these differences in aggregation properties, all Abeta(1-40) preparations were able to disrupt supported total brain lipid extract bilayers, altering the bilayer's morphological and mechanical properties.
