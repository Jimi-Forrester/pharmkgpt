39124629|t|Remimazolam and Its Place in the Current Landscape of Procedural Sedation and General Anesthesia.
39124629|a|Remimazolam was derived from its parent compound by adding an ester linkage into its structure so that the drug becomes a substrate for ester metabolism. As a result, it undergoes organ-independent ester hydrolysis, although the clinical benefits in terms of shorter recovery are not uniformly observed in clinical practice. Remimazolam is mainly tested in procedural sedation. In comparison to propofol, the current gold standard for procedural sedation, its proposed attractiveness is shorter wake-up times and a clear-headed recovery. Its clear advantages over propofol are better hemodynamic stability, lack of pain on injection and availability of a reversal agent in the form of flumazenil. Data on patient and proceduralist satisfaction are lacking. Remimazolam is also used for induction and maintenance of general anesthesia in Japan (where it is approved for this purpose). In this scenario, it is not clear if it can achieve the same degree of lack of recall as propofol. The use of remimazolam in obstetrics, pediatrics and high-risk populations is an emerging area.
