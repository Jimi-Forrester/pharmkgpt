34888201|t|Mania and hypomania associated with COVID-19: a series of 15 cases seen by the consultation-liaison psychiatry service in Qatar.
34888201|a|BACKGROUND: A range of neuropsychiatric diagnoses have been reported in association with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, only sporadic cases of mania or hypomania have been reported in patients with COVID-19. This study aimed to report clinical characteristics of 15 consecutive cases of COVID-19-associated mania or hypomania seen in three general hospitals in Qatar in the early months of the pandemic in 2020. METHODS: This study is a retrospective case-note review of 15 cases of COVID-19-associated mania or hypomania (confirmed by polymerase chain reaction test), seen as inpatient consultations out of the first 100 consecutive patients managed by consultation-liaison psychiatric teams in Qatar between 2 March 2020 and 7 July 2020. RESULTS: The mean age of the 15 patients was 40 years. Twelve patients had mania, and three had hypomania. Regarding the physical severity of COVID-19, 10 patients were asymptomatic, two had upper respiratory tract symptoms alone and three had pneumonia. None of the patients were intubated. Potential risk factors for mania/hypomania included pandemic-related psychosocial stress before admission (n = 9), past history of mania/bipolar disorder (n = 6) or psychosis (n = 2), raised inflammatory markers (n = 7) and steroid use (n = 3). None had a history of recent substance misuse. Other than one patient with advanced cancer, none had comorbidity regarded as likely to have caused mania or hypomania. Three patients had mild white matter ischaemic changes on brain imaging. Standard pharmacological treatment for mania (i.e. antipsychotic medication supplemented by prn benzodiazepines) was effective. Ten patients were discharged home from the COVID-19 facility where they presented, but five required transfer to Qatar's psychiatric hospital for further treatment of mania. CONCLUSION: The association of mania or hypomania with COVID-19 may be spurious (e.g. representing an initial presentation of bipolar disorder) or causal. The reported cases illustrate a range of potential aetiological mechanisms by which COVID-19 could cause mania or hypomania. Cohort studies are necessary to determine the incidence, aetiology and prognosis of COVID-19-associated mania/hypomania.
