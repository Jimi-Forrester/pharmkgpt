38759860|t|Ropinirole reverses the effects of neuroinflammation, and cellular demise by downregulating the MARK4-NFkappabeta signaling system in Alzheimer's disease.
38759860|a|Ropinirole (ROP) is a dopamine agonist that can cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which is crucial for drugs targeting neurological conditions like Alzheimer's disease (AD). The rationale for the current research is to investigate the potential of ROP as an inhibitor of Microtubule affinity regulating kinase 4 (MARK4)-NFkappabeta in neurodegenerative diseases, specifically AD. The interaction between ROP and MARK4-NFkappabeta holds significant promise in the realm of drug discovery and therapeutic interventions for diseases like AD. Molecular docking and biophysical characterization demonstrate how ROP effectively hinders MARK4 activity, offering detailed insights into their molecular interactions. The present research also investigates the biological aspect of MARK4 shows promise in treating AD, with neuroinflammation playing a crucial role in the disease's progression. Abeta42 and ROP were co-administered directly into the cells for the establishment of the AD model. We confirmed that ROP can inhibit the path of MARK4 activity, as evidenced by biophysical characterization, and can enhance the cell viability, lowers the expression of MARK4, decrease the rate of oxidative stress, and attenuate the expression of NFkappabeta, leading to reduced neuronal apoptosis in an in vitro-induced Abeta model. Overall, this research provides valuable mechanistic insights into the neuroprotective potential of ROP and its ability to target the MARK4-NFkappabeta pathway.
