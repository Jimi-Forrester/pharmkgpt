35396628|t|Cryptotanshinone ameliorates MPP+-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis of SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells: the role of STAT3 in Parkinson's disease.
35396628|a|Cryptotanshinone (CTN) has shown its neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory qualities in non-genetic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. According to bioinformatics analysis, CTN and Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3) may interact to form a drug-target network. This study was conducted to identify the role of CTN-STAT3 interaction in Parkinson's disease (PD). PD model was established with MMP+-stimulated SH-SY5Y cells. After pre-treatment with CTN or co-treatment with CTN and STAT3 agonist, MTT assay was performed to observe cell viability; ELISA kit was used to measure the expression level of pro-inflammatory cytokines; DCFH-DA and corresponding assay kits were employed to determine the production of ROS, SOD, CAT and GSH-px; TUNEL assay and western blot were performed to detect cell apoptosis. STAT3 activity was also detected by western blot. Treatment with CTN alone had no impact on SH-SY5Y cell viability, but CTN pre-treatment effectively improved MPP+-induced loss of viability in SH-SY5Y cells. Moreover, pre-treatment with CTN inhibited MPP+-induced oxidative stress, apoptosis and STAT3 activity in SH-SY5Y cells, whereas this inhibitory effect was diminished after additional treatment with STAT3 agonist. CTN ameliorates MPP+-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis of SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells by inhibiting the expression of STAT3. Therefore, CTN could be a promising therapeutic agent, and STAT3 could be a potential target for PD treatment.
