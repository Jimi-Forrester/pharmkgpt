38227760|a|BACKGROUND: The burden of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is growing rapidly, including among older adults. The number of older adults is also rising with concomitantly increasing rates of age-related physical and cognitive dysfunction. However, data on whether MASLD affects physical and cognitive function in older adults is limited. As such, we aimed to identify whether prevalent MASLD influences the risk of incident physical disability or dementia in initially healthy older adults. METHODS: A post-hoc analysis of participants from the ASPREE-XT cohort study, which recruited community-dwelling older adults without a history of cardiovascular disease, dementia, or independence-limiting functional impairment. The Fatty Liver Index (to identify MASLD) was calculated in those with complete data. Cox proportional-hazards models were used to investigate the outcomes of dementia and persistent physical disability in participants with MASLD vs those without. RESULTS: Of the 9 097 individuals included (mean age 75.1 +- 4.2 years; 45.0% men), 341 (3.7%) developed persistent physical disability and 370 (4.1%) developed dementia over a median follow-up of 6.4 years (IQR 5.3-7.5 years). When adjusting for known contributors including age, gender, education, comorbidity, and functional measures, MASLD was associated with an increased risk of persistent physical disability (HR 1.41 [95% CI: 1.07-1.87]) and reduced risk of incident dementia (HR 0.63 [95% CI: 0.48-0.83]). CONCLUSIONS: Prevalent MASLD is associated with reduced rates of incident dementia but increased risk of persistent physical disability in initially relatively healthy older adults. Understanding the mechanisms underlying these divergent results to allow appropriate risk stratification and counseling is important.
