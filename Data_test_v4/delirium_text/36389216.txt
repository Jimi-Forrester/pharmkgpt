36389216|t|Reduced cortical complexity in patients with end-stage kidney disease prior to dialysis initiation.
36389216|a|End-stage kidney disease (ESKD) is associated with cognitive impairment (CI) and affects different aspects of cortical morphometry, but where these changes converge remains unclear. Fractal dimension (FD) is used to represent cortical complexity (CC), which describes the structural complexity of the cerebral cortex by integrating different cortical morphological measures. This study aimed to investigate changes in CC in patients with ESKD prior to initiation of dialysis and to evaluate the relationship between changes in CC, cognitive performance, and uremic toxins. Forty-nine patients with ESKD naive to dialysis and 31 healthy controls (HCs) were assessed using structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and cognitive tests, including evaluations of global cognitive function, memory, and executive function. Clinical laboratory blood tests were performed on all patients with ESKD, including measurement of nine uremic toxin-related indices. CC was measured using MRI data to determine regional FD values. We estimated the association between cognitive performance, uremic toxin levels, and CC changes. Compared to HCs, patients with ESKD showed significantly lower CC in the left precuneus (p = 0.006), left middle temporal cortex (p = 0.010), and left isthmus cingulate cortex (p = 0.018). Furthermore, lower CC in the left precuneus was associated with impaired long-term delayed memory (Pearson r = 0.394, p = 0.042) in patients with ESKD. Our study suggests that regional decreases in CC are an additional characteristic of patients with ESKD naive to dialysis, related to impaired long-term memory performance. These findings may help further understand the underlying neurobiological mechanisms between brain structural changes and CI in patients with ESKD.
