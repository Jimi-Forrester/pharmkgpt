39036166|t|Determinants of Readmission in the Intensive Care Unit: A Prospective Observational Study.
39036166|a|Background The antecedents of readmission among survivors of intensive care units (ICUs) are complex and comprise an array of elements that impact the rehabilitation process after leaving the ICU. The aforementioned determinants may comprise socioeconomic factors, access to follow-up healthcare, the nature and severity of the initial illness or injury, the presence of comorbidities, the sufficiency of transitional care and rehabilitation services, and patient and family support systems. Added to this, the risk of readmission may be increased by complications that develop during the ICU stay, including but not limited to infections, organ dysfunction, and psychological distress. Comprehending these determinants is of the utmost importance for healthcare providers in order to execute focused interventions that seek to diminish readmission rates, enhance patient outcomes, and elevate the standard of care for survivors of ICUs. Objective The objective of the study is to determine the factors associated with readmission among ICU survivors and the cause of readmission. Methodology This prospective observational study was conducted in a tertiary-level ICU. The duration of the study was one year and we enrolled 108 ICU survivors in our study. We have recorded patient demographic data, comorbidity, primary diagnosis, previous treatment history (vasopressor, sedation), causes of readmission, duration of previous ICU stay, and outcome of readmitted patient (discharge, death, and transfer to lower facility). Result The incidence of readmission in our ICU is 10.4%; 50-70 age groups are more prone to readmission of which the male sex is predominant (64.81%). In our study, hypertension (cardiac, 18.52%) and diabetes mellitus (11.11%) were the most common comorbidities reported in readmitted patients. The majority of patients who get readmission suffered from blunt trauma abdomen. In the majority of readmitted patients, sedation was used in the previous admission for ventilation and patient comfort (66.67%). Most of the readmitted patients (68.51%) have a previous ICU stay of more than five days. Patients were readmitted mainly because of respiratory (30.56%) and neurological (25%) complications. In this study, readmitted patients have high mortality (59.26%). Conclusion In a tertiary care ICU, the incidence rate of readmitted patients was 10.4%. Respiratory and neurological problems were the main cause of readmission. In readmitted patients, mortality was high up to 59.26%. Old age, male sex, prolonged ICU stay, comorbidities like hypertension, blunt trauma abdomen, use of sedation, and prolonged mechanical ventilation in previous ICU admission are major risk factors for ICU readmission.
