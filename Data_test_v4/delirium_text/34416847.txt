34416847|t|Persistent Pain After Cardiac Surgery: Prevention and Management.
34416847|a|Persistent postoperative pain (PPP) after cardiac surgery is a significant complication that negatively affects patient quality of life and increases health care system burden. However, there are no standards or guidelines to inform how to mitigate these effects. Therefore, in this review, we will discuss strategies to prevent and manage PPP after cardiac surgery. Adequate perioperative analgesia may prove instrumental in the prevention of PPP. Although opioids have historically been the primary analgesic approach to cardiac surgery, an opioid-sparing strategy may prove advantageous in reducing side effects, avoiding secondary hyperalgesia, and decreasing risk of PPP. Implementing a multimodal analgesic plan using alternative medications and regional anesthetic techniques may offer superior efficacy while reducing adverse effects.
