37760089|a|Sepsis is defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. The brain is one of the organs involved in sepsis, and sepsis-induced brain injury manifests as sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE). SAE may be present in up to 70% of septic patients. SAE has a very wide spectrum of clinical symptoms, ranging from mild behavioral changes through cognitive disorders to disorders of consciousness and coma. The presence of SAE increases mortality in the population of septic patients and may lead to chronic cognitive dysfunction in sepsis survivors. Therefore, therapeutic interventions with neuroprotective effects in sepsis are needed. Melatonin, a neurohormone responsible for the control of circadian rhythms, exerts many beneficial physiological effects. Its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties are well described. It is considered a potential therapeutic factor in sepsis, with positive results from studies on animal models and with encouraging results from the first human clinical trials. With its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory potential, it may also exert a neuroprotective effect in sepsis-associated encephalopathy. The review presents data on melatonin as a potential drug in SAE in the wider context of the pathophysiology of SAE and the specific actions of the pineal neurohormone.
