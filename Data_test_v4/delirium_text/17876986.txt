17876986|a|We reviewed the pharmacological efficacies and side effects of antidepressants. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) are most popularly prescribed for anxiety disorders as well as mild or moderate depression. These drugs have less orthostatic, cognitive, cardiovascular, and anticholinergic side effects. Tricyclic antidepressants are still important for treating severe depression, and mianserin and trazodone are useful for treating delirium. Clinicians should select antidepressants considering their pharmacologic profiles and avoiding adverse effects.
