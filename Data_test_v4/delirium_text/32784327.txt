32784327|t|Prophylactic Physostigmine for Extreme and Refractory Adult Emergence Delirium, Aimed at Increasing Patient Safety and Reducing Health Care Workplace Violence: A Case Report.
32784327|a|Emergence delirium is a well-known phenomenon that may be encountered after general anesthesia. A common approach to this issue is to risk stratify patients preoperatively and treat them postoperatively if emergence delirium occurs. We present the case of a patient with Barrett esophagus and a history of severe and refractory emergence delirium, who was successfully treated prophylactically with physostigmine, resulting in decreased risk of harm to the patient, trauma to the perioperative staff, and a safer and more positive recovery.
