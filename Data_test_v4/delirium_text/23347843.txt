23347843|a|This paper describes a process undertaken to develop and review five clinical vignettes to be used in geriatric nursing educational research. The purpose of this process was to provide valid depictions of delirium and its subtypes and distinguish delirium from dementia. Five vignettes depicting hospital bedside interactions between nursing staff, family, and an older patient who displayed signs of one of the following conditions: delirium (hyper and hypoactive types respectively), dementia, or delirium (both types) superimposed on dementia were constructed. Vignette accuracy and reliability were established using a multistage process that culminated in formal review by a group of ten international nursing and medical delirium experts. The final five vignettes accurately depicted the given scenario as agreed by the experts and were at an appropriate level of simplicity and clarity. Given the increased interest in vignettes for both nursing research and educational purposes, the described method of vignette development and review has the ability to assist other vignette developers in creating reliable representations of their desired clinical scenarios.
