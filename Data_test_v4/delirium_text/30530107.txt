30530107|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurological disorder with diverse underlying pathological processes. Several lines of evidence suggest that BACE1 is a key enzyme in the pathogenesis of AD and its inhibition is of particular importance in AD treatment. Ten new 3-hydrazinyl-1,2,4-triazines bearing pendant aryl phenoxy methyl-1,2,3-triazole were synthesized as multifunctional ligands against AD. We show that compounds containing Cl and NO2 groups at the para position of the phenyl ring, namely compounds 7c (IC50 = 8.55 +- 3.37 microM) and 7d (IC50 = 11.42 +- 2.01 microM), possess promising BACE1 inhibitory potential. Furthermore, we assessed the neuroprotective activities of 7c and 7d derivatives in PC12 neuronal cell line, which showed moderate protection against amyloid beta peptide toxicity. In addition, compound 7d demonstrated metal chelating activity and moderate antioxidant potential (IC50 = 44.42 +- 7.33 microM). Molecular docking studies of these molecules revealed high-affinity binding to several amino acids of BACE1, which are essential for efficient inhibition. These results demonstrate that 1,2,4-triazine derivatives bearing an aryl phenoxy methyl-1,2,3-triazole have promising properties as therapeutic agents for AD.
