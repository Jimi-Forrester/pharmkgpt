35363517|t|Associations of plasma soluble CD22 levels with brain amyloid burden and cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease.
35363517|a|CD22 has been suggested to contribute to Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis by inhibiting microglial amyloid beta (Abeta) phagocytosis. Soluble CD22 (sCD22) generated by cleavage from cell membranes may be a marker of inflammation and microglial dysfunction; but alterations of sCD22 levels in AD and their correlation with AD biomarkers remain unclear. Plasma sCD22 levels were measured in cognitively normal non-AD participants and patients with preclinical AD and AD dementia from a Chinese cohort and the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle Flagship Study of Ageing. Plasma sCD22 levels were elevated in patients with preclinical and dementia AD. Plasma sCD22 levels were negatively correlated with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Abeta42 levels and Abeta42/Abeta40, and positively correlated with CSF phosphorylated tau levels and brain Abeta burden, but negatively correlated with cognitive function. Moreover, higher plasma sCD22 levels were associated with faster cognitive decline during follow-up. These findings suggest that CD22 plays important roles in AD development, and that sCD22 is a potential biomarker for AD.
