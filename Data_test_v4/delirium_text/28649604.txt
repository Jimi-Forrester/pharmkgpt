28649604|a|Protein aggregation is a pathological hallmark of and may play a central role in the neurotoxicity in age-associated neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Accordingly, inhibiting aggregation of amyloidogenic proteins, including amyloid beta and alpha-synuclein, has been a main therapeutic target for these disorders. Among various strategies, amyloid beta immunotherapy has been extensively investigated in Alzheimer's disease, followed by similar studies of alpha-synuclein in Parkinson's disease. Notably, a recent study of solanezumab, an amyloid beta monoclonal antibody, raises hope for the further therapeutic potential of immunotherapy, not only in Alzheimer's disease, but also for other neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's disease. Thus, it is expected that further refinement of immunotherapy against neurodegenerative diseases may lead to increasing efficacy. Meanwhile, type II diabetes mellitus has been associated with an increased risk of neurodegenerative disease, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, and studies have shown that metabolic dysfunction and abnormalities surrounding insulin signaling may underlie disease progression. Naturally, "anti-insulin resistance" therapy has emerged as a novel paradigm in the therapy of neurodegenerative diseases. Indeed, incretin agonists, which stimulate pancreatic insulin secretion, reduce dopaminergic neuronal loss and suppress Parkinson's disease disease progression in clinical trials. Similar studies are ongoing also in Alzheimer's disease. This paper focuses on critical issues in "immunotherapy" and "anti-insulin resistance" therapy in relation to therapeutic strategies against neurodegenerative disease, and more importantly, how they might merge mechanistically at the point of suppression of protein aggregation, raising the possibility that combined immunotherapy and "anti-insulin resistance" therapy may be superior to either monotherapy.
