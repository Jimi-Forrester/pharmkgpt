34248817|t|Long-Term Use of a Sensory Prosthesis Improves Function in a Patient With Peripheral Neuropathy: A Case Report.
34248817|a|Background: Peripheral neuropathy (PN) can result in either partial or complete loss of distal sensation resulting in an increased fall risk. Walkasins  uses a shoe insert to detect the magnitude and direction of sway and sends signals to a leg unit that provides sensory balance cues. The objective of this case report is to describe the long-term influence of the Walkasins  lower limb sensory neuroprosthesis on balance and gait for an individual with diabetic PN. Case Description: A 51-year-old male with a 3-year history of PN and a 10-year history of type II diabetes mellitus was fitted bilaterally with Walkasins  and utilized them 8-10 hours/day for more than 2 years. Although, vibration and tactile sensation thresholds were severely impaired at his 1st metatarsophalangeal joint and the lateral malleolus bilaterally he could perceive tactile stimuli from the Walkasins  above the ankles. Outcomes: Following Walkasins  use, his Activities-specific Balance Confidence Scale (ABC) scores improved from 33 to 80%. His mean Vestibular Activities of Daily Living (VADL) scores decreased from 3.54 to 1. His Functional Gait Assessment (FGA) scores increased from 13/30 to 28/30 and his miniBESTest scores improved from 15/28 to 26/28. Gait speed increased from 0.23 to 1.5 m/s. The patient described a decrease in pain and cramping throughout his lower extremities and an increase in function. Discussion: Gait and balance improved with the use of the Walkasins  and participation in a wellness program. This improvement suggests that the use of sensory substitution devices, such as the Walkasins , may replace sensory deficits related to gait and balance dysfunction experienced by patients with PN. Further research is needed to determine if other patients will have a similar response and what the necessary threshold of sensory function is to benefit from use of the Walkasins .
