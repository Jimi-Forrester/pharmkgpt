37944396|a|OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess the differences of topological characteristic and rich club organization between temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients with focal seizure (FS) only and those with focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures (FBTCS). METHODS: We recruited 130 unilateral TLE patients, of which 57 patients with FS only and 73 patients with both FS and FBTCS, and 68 age- and gender-matched healthy controls (HC). Whole-brain networks were constructed based on diffusion weighted imaging data. Graph theory was applied to quantify the topological network metrics and rich club organization. Network-based statistic (NBS) analysis was administered to investigate the difference in edge-wise connectivity strength. The non-parametric permutation test was applied to evaluate the differences between groups. Benjamini-Hochberg FDR at the alpha of 5% was carried out for multiple comparations. RESULTS: In comparison with HC, both the FS and FBTCS group displayed a significant reduction in whole-brain connectivity strength and global efficiency. The FBTCS group showed lower connectivity strength both in the rich club and feeder connections compared to HC. The FS group had lower connectivity strength in the feeder and local connections compared to HC. NBS analysis revealed a wider range of decreased connectivity strength in the FBTCS group, involving 90% of the rich club regions, mainly affecting temporal-subcortical, frontal-parietal, and frontal-temporal lobe, the majority decreasing connections were between temporal lobe and stratum. While the decreased connectivity strength in the FS group were relatively local, involving 50% of rich club regions, mainly concentrated on the temporal-subcortical lobe. CONCLUSIONS: Network integration was reduced in TLE. TLE with FBTCS selectively disrupted the rich club regions, while TLE with FS only were more likely to affect the non-rich club regions, emphasizing the contribution of rich club organization to seizure generalization.
