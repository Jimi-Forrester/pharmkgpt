34527174|t|Redox-Dependent Effects in the Physiopathological Role of Bile Acids.
34527174|a|Bile acids (BA) are recognized by their role in nutrient absorption. However, there is growing evidence that BA also have endocrine and metabolic functions. Besides, the steroidal-derived structure gives BA a toxic potential over the biological membrane. Thus, cholestatic disorders, characterized by elevated BA on the liver and serum, are a significant cause of liver transplant and extrahepatic complications, such as skeletal muscle, central nervous system (CNS), heart, and placenta. Further, the BA have an essential role in cellular damage, mediating processes such as membrane disruption, mitochondrial dysfunction, and the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress. The purpose of this review is to describe the BA and their role on hepatic and extrahepatic complications in cholestatic diseases, focusing on the association between BA and the generation of oxidative stress that mediates tissue damage.
