32839875|t|A label-free reusable aptasensor for Alzheimer's disease.
32839875|a|To early effectively detect amyloid-beta (Abeta) oligomers, a label-free reusable aptasensor was designed. This aptasensor based on a luminescent nanoscale lanthanum-based metal-organic framework (L-MOF)-armored single-stranded DNA antibody (MOF-armored-anti-DNA antibody) as signal tags and aptamer bound to magnetic beads (Apt-MB) as capture probe. The reusable aptasensor combines signal tag and capture probe with antigen-antibody interaction. When the reusable aptasensor is formed, the strong fluorescence intensity of L-MOF will "turn off" by photo-induced electron transfer from excited states to an unfilled d shell of iron cations on the nanoparticle surface. Upon the presence of Abeta oligomers in serum samples, they can be especially distinguished with the Abeta oligomers aptamer in capture probes and then signal tags are released into the solution for developing the fluorescence aptasensor under excitation/emission 365 nm/430 nm. Meanwhile, the aptamer was recovered from the complex of Abeta oligomers/Apt-MB by heat treatment. When the temperature returns to room temperature, the recovered aptamer in the capture probe can once again bound to the MOF-armored-anti-DNA antibody for reuse. The label-free reusable aptasensor system detection has high sensitivity and selectivity toward Abeta oligomers (LOD = 0.4 pg/mL) and an excellent linear range (0.001-100 ng/mL). This strategy is a fruitful step for the development of reusable aptasensor and may turn on new avenues for the applications of Abeta oligomer detection in clinical diagnosis.Graphical abstract.
