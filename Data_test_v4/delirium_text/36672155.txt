36672155|t|Maternal High Fat Diet Anticipates the AD-like Phenotype in 3xTg-AD Mice by Epigenetic Dysregulation of Abeta Metabolism.
36672155|a|Maternal overnutrition has been reported to affect brain plasticity of the offspring by altering gene expression, regulating both synaptic plasticity and adult neurogenesis. However, whether perinatal metabolic stress may influence the accumulation of misfolded proteins and the development of neurodegeneration remains to be clarified. We investigated the impact of maternal high fat diet (HFD) in an experimental model of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The 3xTg-AD mice born to overfed mothers showed an impairment of synaptic plasticity and cognitive deficits earlier than controls. Maternal HFD also altered the expression of genes regulating amyloid-beta-protein (Abeta) metabolism (i.e., Bace1, Ern1, Ide and Nicastrin) and enhanced Abeta deposition in the hippocampus. Finally, we found an epigenetic derangement and an aberrant recruitment of transcription factors NF-kB and STAT3 and chromatin remodeler HDAC2 on the regulatory sequences of the same genes. Collectively, our data indicate that early life metabolic stress worsens the AD phenotype via epigenetic alteration of genes regulating Abeta synthesis and clearance.
