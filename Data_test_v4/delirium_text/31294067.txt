31294067|a|Ubiquitin specific peptidase 9 (USP9) is a deubiquitinase encoded by a sex-linked gene with a Y-chromosomal form (USP9Y) and an X-chromosomal form (USP9X) that escapes X-inactivation. Since USP9 is a key regulatory gene with sex-linked expression in the human brain, the gene may be of interest for researchers studying molecular gender differences and ubiquitin signaling in the brain. To assess the downstream effects of knocking down USP9X and USP9Y on a transcriptome-wide scale, we have conducted microarray profiling experiments using the human DU145 prostate cancer cell culture model, after confirming the robust expression of both USP9X and USP9Y in this model. By designing shRNA constructs for the specific knockdown of USP9X and the joint knockdown of USP9X and USP9Y, we have compared gene expression changes in both knockdowns to control conditions to infer potential shared and X- or Y-form specific alterations. Here, we provide details of the corresponding microarray profiling data, which has been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus database (GEO series accession number GSE79376). A biological interpretation of the data in the context of a potential involvement of USP9 in Alzheimer's disease has previously been presented in Koglsberger et al. (2016). To facilitate the re-use and re-analysis of the data for other applications, e.g. the study of ubiquitin signaling and protein turnover control, and the regulation of molecular gender differences in the human brain and brain-related disorders, we provide a more in-depth discussion of the data properties, specifications and possible use cases.
