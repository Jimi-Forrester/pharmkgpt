36347892|t|Remimazolam besylate for the sedation of postoperative patients undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation in the ICU: a prospective dose-response study.
36347892|a|This single-center study aimed to determine the effective dose and safety of remimazolam besylate for the sedation of postoperative patients undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit (ICU). Mechanically ventilated patients admitted to the ICU after surgery were included. The Narcotrend index (NTI) was used to assess the depth of sedation, and the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) score was also recorded. Remimazolam besylate was administered initially at a loading dose of 0.02 mg/kg, followed by a gradual increase of 0.005 mg/kg each time until the targeted depth of sedation was achieved (NTI 65-94). A maintenance dose of remimazolam besylate was administered starting at 0.2 mg/kg/h, followed by increments or subtractions of 0.05 mg/kg/h each time until a satisfactory depth of sedation was achieved and maintained for at least 30 min. The demographic data, anesthesia, surgery types, hemodynamics and respiratory parameters were recorded. Adverse events and adverse drug reactions were monitored for safety. Twenty-three patients were eventually included in this study covering a period of 1 year. A satisfactory depth of sedation was achieved by a single intravenous infusion of remimazolam besylate at a loading dose of 0.02-0.05 mg/kg followed by a maintenance dose of 0.20-0.35 mg/kg/h. There were no significant changes in hemodynamic and respiratory parameters within 10 min after the administration of remimazolam besylate. In addition, a significant correlation was observed between the NTI and the RASS score for assessing sedation (r = 0.721, P < 0.001). The NTI showed a predictive probability for a RASS score of 0.817. Remimazolam besylate was effective for mild/moderate sedation of invasively mechanically ventilated postoperative patients in the ICU while maintaining excellent respiratory and hemodynamic stability. The NTI can be used as a good tool for the objective evaluation of the depth of sedation and agitation.
