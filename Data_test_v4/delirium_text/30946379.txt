30946379|a|BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic colorectal surgery may adversely affect respiration, circulation, and acid-base balance in elderly patients, owing to the relatively long duration of CO2 absorption. We conducted this retrospective study to determine the safety and efficacy of warmed, humidified CO2 pneumoperitoneum in elderly patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal surgery. METHODS: We enrolled 245 patients between January 2016 and August 2018.The experimental group (warming and humidification group [WH]) received warmed (37 C), humidified (98%) insufflation of CO2, and the control group (cold, dry CO2/control group [CD]) received standard CO2 (19 C, 0%). All other aspects of patient care were standardized. Intraoperative hemodynamic data, arterial blood pH, and lactic acid levels were recorded. We also recorded intra-abdominal pressure, incidence of shivering 1 hour after surgery, satisfaction scores of patients and surgeons 24 hours after surgery, times to first flatus/defecation, first bowel movement, and tolerance of semiliquid food, discharge time, and incidence of vomiting, diarrhea, and surgical site infections. RESULTS: Compared with the WH group, heart rate and mean arterial pressure were significantly higher from T3 to T8 (P < .05), lactic acid levels were significantly higher from T4 to T9 (P < .05), and recovery time in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) was significantly longer in the CD group (P < .05). Patient and surgeon satisfaction scores were significantly higher in the WH group than the CD group (P < .05). In addition, the times to first flatus/defecation and bowel movement were significantly longer in the CD group (P < .05). No significant differences were noted between the groups in the time to tolerance of semiliquid food and time of discharge (P > .05). The incidence of vomiting, diarrhea, and shivering was significantly lower in the WH group (P < .05). The number of patients with a shivering grade of 0 was significantly higher in the WH group, whereas the number with a shivering grade of 3 was significantly higher in the CD group (P < .05). CONCLUSION: Warmed, humidified insufflation of CO2 in elderly patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal surgery could stabilize hemodynamics, and reduce lactic acid levels, recovery time in the PACU, and the incidence of acute gastrointestinal injury-related symptoms.
