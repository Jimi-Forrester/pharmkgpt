39175393|t|A case of telehealth-directed emergency front-of-neck access (FONA).
39175393|a|In this case, we describe the completion of emergency front-of-neck access by a novice provider facilitated by specialist telehealth support. A facility with limited advanced airway skills requested telehealth support for a critically unwell patient with severe hypoxic respiratory failure and acute delirium. Attempts to temporise his physiology with ketamine-facilitated non-invasive ventilation were unsuccessful, and he proceeded to rapid sequence intubation. Ultimately, intubation was unsuccessful and attempts at ventilation by laryngeal mask also failed. A Cannot Intubate, Cannot Oxygenate scenario was identified. The referring team had significant anxiety about performing a surgical front-of-neck access procedure. However, with telehealth support, this was ultimately completed by a novice provider, and the patient stabilised. The key issue identified was the need for the telehealth provider to take clinical governance of the procedure. The referring team also required assistance in completing an adequate neck incision, responding to bleeding, and determining the preferred technique.
