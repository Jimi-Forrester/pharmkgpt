28725691|t|Hippocampal subfield atrophy in relation to cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers and cognition in early Parkinson's disease: a cross-sectional study.
28725691|a|Cognition is often affected early in Parkinson's disease (PD). Lewy body and amyloid beta (Abeta) pathology and cortical atrophy may be involved. The aim of this study was to examine whether medial temporal lobe structural changes may be linked to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker levels and cognition in early PD. PD patients had smaller volumes of total hippocampus, presubiculum, subiculum, CA2-3, CA4-DG, and hippocampal tail compared with normal controls (NCs). In the PD group, lower CSF Abeta38 and 42 were significant predictors for thinner perirhinal cortex. Lower Abeta42 and smaller presubiculum and subiculum predicted poorer verbal learning and delayed verbal recall. Smaller total hippocampus, presubiculum and subiculum predicted poorer visuospatial copying. Lower Abeta38 and 40 and thinner perirhinal cortex predicted poorer delayed visual reproduction. In conclusion, smaller volumes of hippocampal subfields and subhippocampal cortex thickness linked to lower CSF Abeta levels may contribute to cognitive impairment in early PD. Thirty-three early PD patients (13 without, 5 with subjective, and 15 with mild cognitive impairment) and NC had 3 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. The MRI scans were post processed for volumes of hippocampal subfields and entorhinal and perirhinal cortical thickness. Lumbar puncture for CSF biomarkers Abeta38, 40, 42, total tau, phosphorylated tau (Innogenetics), and total alpha-synuclein (Meso Scale Diagnostics) were performed. Multiple regression analyses were used for between-group comparisons of the MRI measurements in the NC and PD groups and for assessment of CSF biomarkers and neuropsychological tests in relation to morphometry in the PD group.
