33514020|a|Exercise and antioxidants have health benefits that improve cognitive impairment and may act synergistically. In this study, we examined the effects of treadmill exercise (TE) and mitochondria-targeted antioxidant mitoquinone (MitoQ), individually or combined, on learning and memory, mitochondrial dynamics, NADPH oxidase activity, and neuroinflammation and antioxidant activity in the hippocampus of D-galactose-induced aging rats. TE alone and TE combined with MitoQ in aging rats reduced mitochondrial fission factors (Drp1, Fis1) and increased mitochondrial fusion factors (Mfn1, Mfn2, Opa1). These groups also exhibited improved NADPH oxidase activity and antioxidant activity (SOD-2, catalase). TE or MitoQ alone decreased neuroinflammatory response (COX-2, TNF-alpha), but the suppression was greater with their combination. In addition, aging-increased neuroinflammation in the dentate gyrus was decreased in TE but not MitoQ treatment. Learning and memory tests showed that, contrarily, MitoQ alone demonstrated some similar effects to TE but not a definitive improvement. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that MitoQ exerted some positive effects on aging when used as an isolated treatment, but TE had a more effective role on cognitive impairment, oxidative stress, inflammation, and mitochondria dysfunction. Our findings suggest that the combination of TE and MitoQ exerted no synergistic effects and indicated regular exercise should be the first priority in neuroprotection of age-related cognitive decline.
