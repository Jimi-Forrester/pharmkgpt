37248398|a|Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) is a parasitic disease originating in sub-Saharan Africa. There is limited information about the changes in the blood brain barrier (BBB) during this infection. This study is the first to apply diffusion weighted ASL (DWASL) to examine changes in BBB impairment. No significant changes in water exchange across the BBB were found during the infection, even when a loss of barrier integrity was seen using Contrast Enhanced MRI (Gd-DTPA) during the late stage of the disease. Furthermore, using multiple boli ASL (mbASL), changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF) were found during the course of infection. Overall, this study highlights the need for further study of the BBB during HAT infection to understand the complex mechanisms behind impairment.
