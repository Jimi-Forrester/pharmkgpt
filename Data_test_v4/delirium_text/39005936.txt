39005936|a|Background: The increasing prevalence of fungal infections necessitates broader use of antifungal medications. However, the prevalence of adverse drug events (ADEs) restricts their clinical application. This study aimed to develop a reliable ADEs trigger for antifungals to enable proactive ADEs monitoring, serving as a reference for ADEs prevention and control. Methods: This investigation comprises two phases. Initially, the trigger was established via a literature review, extraction of relevant items, and refinement through Delphi expert consultation. Subsequently, the validity of the trigger was assessed by analyzing hospital records of antifungal drug users from 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2020. The correlation between each trigger signal and ADEs occurrence was examined, and the sensitivity and specificity of the trigger were evaluated through the spontaneous reporting system (SRS) and Global Trigger Tool (GTT). Additionally, risk factors contributing to adverse drug events (ADEs) resulting from antifungal use were analyzed. Results: Twenty-one preliminary triggers were refined into 21 final triggers after one expert round. In the retrospective analysis, the positive trigger rate was 65.83%, with a positive predictive value (PPV) of 28.75%. The incidence of ADEs in inpatients was 28.75%, equating to 44.58 ADEs per 100 admissions and 33.04 ADEs per 1,000 patient days. Predominant ADEs categories included metabolic disturbances, gastrointestinal damage, and skin rashes. ADEs severity was classified into 36 cases at grade 1, 160 at grade 2, and 18 at grade 3. The likelihood of ADEs increased with longer stays, more positive triggers, and greater comorbidity counts. Conclusion: This study underscores the effectiveness of the GTT in enhancing ADEs detection during antifungal medication use, thereby confirming its value as a monitoring tool.
