16645268|a|The association between stroke and dementia is frequent. The prevalence of poststroke dementia (PSD) ranges from 6 to 32%, depending on the population studied, the criteria used for the diagnosis of dementia, and the time interval between the stroke and the neuropsychological assessment. The risk of PSD is high immediately after stroke and remains higher than in controls in stroke patients nondemented 3 months after stroke. Not all cases of PSD are vascular in origin, with about one third of demented patients diagnosed as having Alzheimer's disease plus stroke. The pathophysiology of PSD is probably multifactorial, with an influence of vascular lesions, associated Alzheimer's lesions and white matter changes. The risk of dementia is higher in older patients and in patients with preexisting cognitive decline - no dementia, severe stroke, a history of stroke, white matter changes and cerebral atrophy. The influence of stroke location, vascular risk factors and silent infarcts remains to be determined. PSD adversely influences the outcome in stroke patients.
