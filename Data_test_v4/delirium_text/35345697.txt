35345697|a|Introduction This prospective, randomized controlled study aimed to investigate the efficacy and respiratory effects of postoperative pain management with an erector spinae plane block in patients undergoing percutaneous nephrolithotomy. Methods Sixty American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) I-II patients aged 18-65 years, scheduled to undergo percutaneous nephrolithotomy, were randomized either to the erector spinae plane block (ESPB) or control group. Fifteen mL 0.5% bupivacaine at the T11 level was administered preoperatively using the in-plane technique in the ESPB group. In both groups, 1 gr of intravenous paracetamol was administered intraoperatively. Postoperative pain and agitation were evaluated using the visual analog scale (VAS), dynamic VAS at zero, six, and 24 hours, and the Riker sedation-agitation scale at the 0th hour after surgery. Peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) and oxygen saturation (SpO2) were measured in preoperative examination and at the 0th, 6th, and 24th hours postoperatively. The time and number of the analgesic requirement, mobilization, and discharge time were also recorded. Results A significantly lower VAS and dynamic VAS were observed at the 0th, 6th, and 24th hours in the ESPB group (p<0.05 for each timepoint). The postoperative/preoperative PEFR ratio was lower and there were more agitated patients in the control group (p<0.05). Conclusion An erector spinae plane block may have additional clinical advantages while providing effective analgesia in patients who underwent percutaneous nephrolithotomy compared to intravenous analgesia.
