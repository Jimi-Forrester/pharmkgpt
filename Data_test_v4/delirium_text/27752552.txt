27752552|a|OBJECTIVE: We examined the pain-relieving effect of ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia performed by emergency physicians on elderly hip fracture patients. METHODS: This study is a prospective, non-randomized, case-control study. The subjects were patients older than 65 years who visited the emergency department with a hip fracture. After we obtained informed consent, two emergency physicians performed an ultrasound-guided three-in-one femoral block using 20 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine. The pain score was measured just before regional anesthesia, and 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours after the procedure. Another group of patients was given multiple doses of morphine to control the pain. We compared the change in pain score and the development of adverse reactions between the two groups. RESULTS: A total of 47 patients were enrolled in this study, of which 25 were given regional anesthesia. Successful pain control (pain score<4) was significantly higher in the regional anesthesia group (96.0% vs. 40.9%; P<0.001). The decrease in pain score was significantly higher in the regional anesthesia group (7 [interquartile range, 6 to 7] vs. 4 [interquartile range, 3 to 5]; P< 0.001). The only adverse reaction observed was mild nausea in 4 patients (1 out of 25 from the regional anesthesia group and 3 out of 22 from the morphine group). CONCLUSION: Ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia administered by emergency physicians treating elderly hip fracture patients provided faster pain relief and a larger decrease in pain than conventional intravenous injections of morphine.
