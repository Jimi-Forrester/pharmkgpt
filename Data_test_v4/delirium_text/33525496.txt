33525496|a|This study aims to investigate whether frailty severity in conjunction with cognitive function, termed as" cognitive frailty", is associated with dietary diversity in older adults. This cross-sectional study used the data from the 2014-2016 Nutrition and Health Survey in Taiwan (N = 1115; age >= 65 years). Dietary intake was assessed using a 24 h dietary recall and food-frequency questionnaire, and dietary diversity score (DDS; range, 0-6) and food intake frequency were calculated. The presence of frailty phenotypes was determined using the FRAIL scale, which was proposed by the International Association of Nutrition and Aging, and cognitive function was assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score. The prevalence of cognitive frailty (FRAIL scale score >= 3 and MMSE score <= 26) was 4.2%. A higher consumption frequency of dairy products, whole grains, vegetables, fruit, fish and seafood, nuts, tea, and coffee, as well as lower pickled vegetable, was inversely associated with cognitive frailty. Those with prefrailty or frailty and lower DDS demonstrated a higher cognitive impairment risk (adjust odds ratio (OR) = 2.15, 95% confidence interval = 1.21-3.83) than those without frailty and higher DDS. Older adults with cognitive prefrailty or cognitive frailty were associated with lower DDS, and frailty with lower DDS was associated with worsening cognitive function.
