36319532|a|OBJECTIVES: Incidence of post-intensive care syndrome at one month after hospital discharge in surviving critically ill COVID 19 patients and to identify associated factors. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Two multipurpose critical care units of the Araba University Hospital. Patients admitted to critical care units for severe acute respiratory failure secondary to COVID 19. INTERVENTION: None. VARIABLES OF INTEREST: Demographic variables, length of stay, Charlson index, APACHE II, SOFA, days of mechanical ventilation, tracheotomy, delirium, tetraparesis of the critical patient, EuroQol 5D5L, Minimental Test. RESULTS: A deterioration in the EuroQol health index (HI) from 90.9+-16.9 to 70.9+-24.7 (p<0.001) was observed. The impairment of the five EuroQol domains is: mobility (46.1%), usual activities (44.7%), discomfort/pain (30.7%), psychological domain (27.3%) and self-care (20.3%). The 61.5% suffer a significant decrease in their health index. Multivariate analysis by logistic regression shows us that delirium (OR=3.01; 95%CI: 1.01-8.9; p=0.047) and tracheostomy (OR=2.37; 95%CI: 1.09-5.14; p=0.029) show association with drop in EuroQoL 5D5L SI. The area under the ROC curve of the model is 67.3%, with a confidence interval between 58% and 76%. The model is calibrated using the Hosmer-Lemeshow test (chi2=0.468; p=0.792). Only 1.2% of patients showed a score <= 24, clearly pathological, on the Folstein's Minimental Test. CONCLUSIONS: Delirium and need for tracheostomy are associated with post-intensive care syndrome assessed by EuroQol 5D5L.
