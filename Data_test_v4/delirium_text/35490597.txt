35490597|a|Uncovering the non-trivial brain structure-function relationship is fundamentally important for revealing organizational principles of human brain. However, it is challenging to infer a reliable relationship between individual brain structure and function, e.g., the relations between individual brain structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC). Brain structure-function displays a distributed and heterogeneous pattern, that is, many functional relationships arise from non-overlapping sets of anatomical connections. This complex relation can be interwoven with widely existed individual structural and functional variations. Motivated by the advances of generative adversarial network (GAN) and graph convolutional network (GCN) in the deep learning field, in this work, we proposed a multi-GCN based GAN (MGCN-GAN) to infer individual SC based on corresponding FC by automatically learning the complex associations between individual brain structural and functional networks. The generator of MGCN-GAN is composed of multiple multi-layer GCNs which are designed to model complex indirect connections in brain network. The discriminator of MGCN-GAN is a single multi-layer GCN which aims to distinguish the predicted SC from real SC. To overcome the inherent unstable behavior of GAN, we designed a new structure-preserving (SP) loss function to guide the generator to learn the intrinsic SC patterns more effectively. Using Human Connectome Project (HCP) dataset and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset as test beds, our MGCN-GAN model can generate reliable individual SC from FC. This result implies that there may exist a common regulation between specific brain structural and functional architectures across different individuals.
