30784080|t|The brain cognitive reserve hypothesis: A review with emphasis on the contribution of nuclear medicine neuroimaging techniques.
30784080|a|Neuropathological and clinical evidence indicates that the clinical expression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) occurs as neuropathology exceeds the brain reserve capacity. The brain or cognitive reserve (BCR) hypothesis states that high premorbid intelligence, education, and an active and stimulating lifestyle provide reserve capacity, which acts as a buffer against the cognitive deficits due to accumulating neuropathology. Neuroimaging studies that assessed the BCR hypothesis are critically reviewed with emphasis on study design and statistical analysis. Many studies were performed in the last two decades owing to the increasing availability of positron emission tomography (PET) and PET/computed tomography scanners and to the synthesis of new radiopharmaceuticals, including tracers for amyloid and tau proteins. Studies with different tracers provided complementary consistent results supporting the BCR hypothesis. Many studies were appropriately designed with a measure of reserve, a measure of brain anatomy/function/neuropathology, and a measure of cognitive functions that are necessary. Most of the early studies were performed with PET and [ 18 F]fluorodeoxyglucose, and occasionally with [ 15 O]water, reporting a significant association between higher occupation/education and lower glucose metabolism (blood flow) in associative temporo-parietal cortex in patients with AD and also in patients with MCI, after correcting for the degree in the cognitive impairment. On the contrary, performances on several neuropsychological tests increased with increasing education for participants with elevated [ 11 C]PiB uptake. Studies with the tracers specific for tau protein showed that patients with AD with elevated tau deposits had higher cognitive performances compared with patients with similar levels of tau deposits. BCR in AD is also associated with a preserved cholinergic function. The BCR hypothesis has been validated with methodologically sound study designs and sophisticated neuroimaging techniques using different radiotracers and providing an explanation for neuropathological and clinical observations on patients with AD.
