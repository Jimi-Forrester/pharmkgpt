32751038|t|Using an Evidence-Based Approach for Assessing and Identifying Delirium Among Medical-Surgical Patients in the Acute Care Setting.
32751038|a|Objective: The scholarship of the doctor of nursing practice (DNP) is crucial in the use of evidence-based practice to address clinical gaps in practice. The Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) is a literature supported tool for the assessment of delirium. Registered nurses (RNs) were educated on the application of the CAM for their patients. Method: RNs on two medical-surgical units received education about delirium and use of the CAM. The CAM tool was used for 2 weeks on all admitted patients. Result: There was an 11% increase in knowledge gained during the educational sessions. There were 15 patients identified with a suggestive diagnosis of delirium via the CAM during a 2-week period. Conclusion: Using evidence-based practice to solve clinical problems enhances quality of life. Prompt identification of delirium can help to reverse delirium and adverse sequelae.
