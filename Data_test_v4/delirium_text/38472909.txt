38472909|a|The issue of lipid changes in muscle foods under the action of atmospheric oxygen has captured the attention of researchers for over a century. Lipid oxidative processes initiate during the slaughtering of animals and persist throughout subsequent technological processing and storage of the finished product. The oxidation of lipids in muscle foods is a phenomenon extensively deliberated in the scientific community, acknowledged as one of the pivotal factors affecting their quality, safety, and human health. This review delves into the nature of lipid oxidation in muscle foods, highlighting mechanisms of free radical initiation and the propagation of oxidative processes. Special attention is given to the natural antioxidant protective system and dietary factors influencing the stability of muscle lipids. The review traces mechanisms inhibiting oxidative processes, exploring how changes in lipid oxidative substrates, prooxidant activity, and the antioxidant protective system play a role. A critical review of the oxidative stability and safety of meat products is provided. The impact of oxidative processes on the quality of muscle foods, including flavour, aroma, taste, colour, and texture, is scrutinised. Additionally, the review monitors the effect of oxidised muscle foods on human health, particularly in relation to the autooxidation of cholesterol. Associations with coronary cardiovascular disease, brain stroke, and carcinogenesis linked to oxidative stress, and various infections are discussed. Further studies are also needed to formulate appropriate technological solutions to reduce the risk of chemical hazards caused by the initiation and development of lipid peroxidation processes in muscle foods.
