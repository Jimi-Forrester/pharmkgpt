38391707|t|Modified RCTU Score: A Semi-Quantitative, Visual Tool for Predicting Alzheimer's Conversion from aMCI.
38391707|a|This research evaluated the modified RCTU score, derived from amyloid PET scans, for predicting the progression from amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (aMCI) to Alzheimer's Disease (AD). aMCI patients underwent baseline evaluations, including amyloid PET. AD conversion was identified through neuropsychological tests after observation. The RCTU was modified by segmenting frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes into left and right, resulting in seven areas. Scores from both modified and conventional RCTU were analyzed and compared. Among 45 patients, 12 progressed to AD (over 17.8 +- 6.8 months). AD converters showed higher scores in modified RCTU scores. Modified RCTU score had strong correlations with amyloid SUVR (r > 0.7). Modified RCTU sum score was the significant covariate of AD conversion. Modified RCTU could determine the asymmetry of amyloid deposits. We demonstrated that symmetric deposits of amyloid showed a higher risk for AD conversion when analyzed using modified RCTU. The modified RCTU score is a promising method for predicting AD conversion, correlating strongly with amyloid SUVR.
