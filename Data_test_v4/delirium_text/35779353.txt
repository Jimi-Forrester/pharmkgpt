35779353|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common forms of dementia. Current anti-AD therapeutics exploit the cholinergic hypothesis of its pathophysiology; they aim to inhibit cerebral cholinesterases. K1234 is a novel hybrid molecule derived from Huperzine A and 7-MEOTA-huperzine which shows increased potency in acetylcholinesterase inhibition in vitro compared to the compounds themselves. The study focused on description of the pharmacokinetic behaviour of K1234, blood-brain barrier penetration, identification of the main in vitro and in vivo metabolites. K1234 is relatively non-toxic compound, that is rapidly absorbed after i.p. administration reaching Cmax within minutes, with extensive distribution into tissues and fast metabolism in mice. The dominant metabolic pathway appears to be glucuronidation of the parent molecule and its phase-I metabolites. The passage of K1234 across the blood-brain-barrier in mice appears to be limited, as it reached only approximately one third of the AUC of plasma.
