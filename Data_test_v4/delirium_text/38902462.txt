38902462|a|BACKGROUND: Post-operative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a concern for clinicians that often presents post-surgery where generalized anesthesia has been used. Its prevalence ranges from 36.6% in young adults to 42.4% in older individuals. Conceptual clarity for POCD is lacking in the currently body literature. Our two-fold purpose of this concept analysis was to (1) critically appraise the various definitions, while also providing the best definition, of POCD and (2) narratively synthesize the attributes, surrogate or related terms, antecedents (risk factors), and consequences of the concept. METHOD: The reporting of our review was guided by the PRISMA statement and the 6-step evolutionary approach to concept analysis developed by Rodgers. Three databases, including Medline, CINAHL, and Web of Science, were searched to retrieve relevant literature on the concept of POCD. Two independent reviewers conducted abstract and full-text screening, data extraction, and appraisal. The review process yielded a final set of 86 eligible articles. RESULT: POCD was defined with varying severities ranging from subtle-to-extensive cognitive changes (1) affecting single or multiple cognitive domains that manifest following major surgery (2), is transient and reversible, and (3) may last for several weeks to years. The consequences of POCD may include impaired quality of life, resulting from withdrawal from the labor force, increased patients' dependencies, cognitive decline, an elevated risk of dementia, rising healthcare costs, and eventual mortality. CONCLUSION: This review resulted in a refined definition and comprehensive analysis of POCD that can be useful to both researchers and clinicians. Future research is needed to refine the operational definitions of POCD so that they better represent the defining attributes of the concept.
