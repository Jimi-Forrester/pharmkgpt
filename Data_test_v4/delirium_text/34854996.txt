34854996|a|Limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE) is characterized by the accumulation of TAR-DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) aggregates in older adults. LATE coexists with Lewy body disease (LBD) as well as other neuropathological changes including Alzheimer's disease (AD). We aimed to identify the pathological, clinical, and genetic characteristics of LATE in LBD (LATE-LBD) by comparing it with LATE in AD (LATE-AD), LATE with mixed pathology of LBD and AD (LATE-LBD + AD), and LATE alone (Pure LATE). We analyzed four cohorts of autopsy-confirmed LBD (n = 313), AD (n = 282), LBD + AD (n = 355), and aging (n = 111). We assessed the association of LATE with patient profiles including LBD subtype and AD neuropathologic change (ADNC). We studied the morphological and distributional differences between LATE-LBD and LATE-AD. By frequency analysis, we staged LATE-LBD and examined the association with cognitive impairment and genetic risk factors. Demographic analysis showed LATE associated with age in all four cohorts and the frequency of LATE was the highest in LBD + AD followed by AD, LBD, and Aging. LBD subtype and ADNC associated with LATE in LBD or AD but not in LBD + AD. Pathological analysis revealed that the hippocampal distribution of LATE was different between LATE-LBD and LATE-AD: neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions were more frequent in cornu ammonis 3 (CA3) in LATE-LBD compared to LATE-AD and abundant fine neurites composed of C-terminal truncated TDP-43 were found mainly in CA2 to subiculum in LATE-LBD, which were not as numerous in LATE-AD. Some of these fine neurites colocalized with phosphorylated alpha-synuclein. LATE-LBD staging showed LATE neuropathological changes spread in the dentate gyrus and brainstem earlier than in LATE-AD. The presence and prevalence of LATE in LBD associated with cognitive impairment independent of either LBD subtype or ADNC; LATE-LBD stage also associated with the genetic risk variants of TMEM106B rs1990622 and GRN rs5848. These data highlight clinicopathological and genetic features of LATE-LBD.
