34536746|a|BACKGROUND: Early detection of oxidant-antioxidant levels and special care in severe patients are important in combating the COVID-19 epidemic. However, this process is costly and time consuming. Therefore, there is a need for faster, reliable and economical methods. METHODS: In this study, antioxidant/oxidant levels of patients were estimated by Expert-models using biomarkers, which are effective in the diagnosis/prognosis of COVID-19 disease. For this purpose, Expert-models were trained and created between the white-blood-cell-count (WBC), lymphocyte-count (LYM), C-reactive-protein (CRP), D-dimer, ferritin values of 35 patients with COVID-19 and antioxidant/oxidant parameter values of the same patients. Error criteria and R2 ratio were taken into account for the performance of the models. The validity of the all models was checked by the Box-Jenkis-method. RESULTS: Antioxidant/Oxidant levels were estimated with 95% confidence-coefficient using the values of WBC, LYM, CRP, D-dimer, ferritin of different 500 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 with the trained models. The error rate of all models was low and the coefficients of determination were sufficient. In the first data set, there was no significant difference between measured antioxidant/oxidant levels and predicted antioxidant/oxidant levels. This result showed that the models are accurate and reliable. In determining antioxidant/oxidant levels, LYM and ferritin biomarkers had the most effect on models, while WBC and CRP biomarkers had the least effect. The antioxidant/oxidant parameter estimated with the highest accuracy was Native-Thiol divided by Total-Thiol. CONCLUSIONS: The results showed that the antioxidant/oxidant levels of infected patients can be estimated accurately and reliably with LYM, ferritin, D-dimer, WBC, CRP biomarkers in the COVID-19 outbreak.
