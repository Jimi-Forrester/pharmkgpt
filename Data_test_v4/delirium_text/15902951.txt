15902951|t|Participation in a dementia evaluation program: perceptions of family members.
15902951|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic, disabling, eventually fatal condition that affects approximately 4 million adults in the United States. The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore several issues from the caregiver's perspective: the experience of having a family member diagnosed with AD, participating in a dementia evaluation program, and complying with that program's recommendations. Interview data from 18 family members revealed (a) a pivotal event led to medical intervention, (b) obtaining the diagnosis was a surprise, and (c) dementia evaluation program recommendations were in place at least marginally 6 months after diagnosis. These caregivers desire assistance from healthcare professionals regarding recommendationsfor appropriate and routine medical and social support and follow-up care. As the population ages and the incidence of AD increases, the perspective of caregivers who make healthcare decisions becomes increasingly important.
