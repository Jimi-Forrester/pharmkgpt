38580173|t|A Critical Appraisal of Blood-Based Biomarkers for Alzheimer's Disease.
38580173|a|Biomarkers that predict the clinical onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD) enable the identification of individuals in the early, preclinical stages of the disease. Detecting AD at this point may allow for more effective therapeutic interventions and optimized enrollment for clinical trials of novel drugs. The current biological diagnosis of AD is based on the AT(N) classification system with the measurement of brain deposition of amyloid-beta (Abeta) ("A"), tau pathology ("T"), and neurodegeneration ("N"). Diagnostic cut-offs for Abeta1-42, the Abeta1-42/Abeta1-40 ratio, tau and hyperphosphorylated-tau concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid have been defined and may support AD clinical diagnosis. Blood-based biomarkers of the AT(N) categories have been described in the AD continuum. Cross-sectional and longitudinal studies have shown that the combination of blood biomarkers tracking neuroaxonal injury (neurofilament light chain) and neuroinflammatory pathways (glial fibrillary acidic protein) enhance sensitivity and specificity of AD clinical diagnosis and improve the prediction of AD onset. However, no international accepted cut-offs have been identified for these blood biomarkers. A kit for blood Abeta1-42/Abeta1-40 is commercially available in the U.S.; however, it does not provide a diagnosis, but simply estimates the risk of developing AD. Although blood-based AD biomarkers have a great potential in the diagnostic work-up of AD, they are not ready for the routine clinical use.
