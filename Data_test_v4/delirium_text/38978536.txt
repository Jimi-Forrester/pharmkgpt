38978536|t|Association between dietary variety status and sarcopenia as defined by the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia 2019 consensus in older outpatients at a hospital specializing in geriatric medicine: A cross-sectional study with baseline data of prospective cohort study (JUSTICE-TOKYO study).
38978536|a|To the best of our knowledge, little is known about the association between dietary variety status and sarcopenia in university-affiliated geriatric hospital in elderly. The present study aimed to investigate, in a multidisciplinary setting, the prevalence of sarcopenia and association between dietary variety status and sarcopenia in older outpatients at Juntendo Tokyo Koto Geriatric Medical Center (Tokyo, Japan). Between October 2020 and December 2021, a cross-sectional study of outpatients aged >=65 years [458 male (44%) and 584 female (56%); mean age, 78.2+-6.1 years] was conducted to assess prevalence of sarcopenia, according to Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia 2019 criteria, and the relationship between dietary variety status and sarcopenia. Patient profile, comorbidities, drug use, neuropsychological data, abdominal symptoms, pulmonary function and dietary variety status were collected. Of 1,042 subjects, there were 223 (21.4%) with [142 male (63.7%) and 81 female (36.3%); mean age, 80.6+-6.3 years] and 819 (78.6%) without sarcopenia [316 male (38.6%) and 503 female (61.4%); mean age, 77.6+-5.8]. In multivariate analysis, older age, male sex, low body mass index, high Brinkman Index and phase angle, low quality of life, history of daycare use, diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis and low Mini-Mental State Examination and Dietary Variety Score were related to sarcopenia. The prevalence of sarcopenia was higher in than in community-dwelling individuals. Dietary variety status was associated with sarcopenia.
