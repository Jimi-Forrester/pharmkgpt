37026080|t|The Relationship Between Sarcopenia, Cognitive Impairment, and Cerebral White Matter Hyperintensity in the Elderly.
37026080|a|Purpose: To explore the relationship between sarcopenia-related indices, cognitive impairment and cerebral white matter hyperintensities. Patients and methods: Ninety-five hospitalized older adults aged 60 years and older were used in this study. Three sarcopenia-related indicators were measured: hand grip strength (Measured with a spring-type dynamometer), gait speed (6m step speed method), and appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASM, bioelectrical impedance). Sarcopenia was defined according to the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia (AWGS) criteria. Cognitive function was assessed using Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Cerebral white matter hyperintensity was assessed using 3.0T superconducting magnetic resonance imaging. Results: In both men and women, these three indices of sarcopenia were significantly and negatively correlated with WMH grades, except for appendicular skeletal muscle mass and WMH grades in women. Scores on the MoCA scale were significantly positive correlated with grip strength, and ASM, both in men and women. After adjusting for confounders and WMHs, regression analyses showed an increased incidence of cognitive impairment in patients with sarcopenia relative to those without sarcopenia. Conclusion: Lower sarcopenia-related indices were significantly associated with cognitive impairment. WMHs may be one of the factors linking sarcopenia and cognitive function.
