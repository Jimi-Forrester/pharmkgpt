30784008|t|Intraoperative reduction of vasopressors using processed electroencephalographic monitoring in patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery: a randomized clinical trial.
30784008|a|Intraoperative vasopressor and fluid application are common strategies against hypotension. Use of processed electroencephalographic monitoring (pEEG) may reduce vasopressor application, a known risk factor for organ dysfunction, in elective cardiac surgery patients. Randomized single-centre clinical trial at Jena University Hospital. Adult patients operated on cardiopulmonary bypass or off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting were randomised to receive anesthesia with visible or blinded pEEG using Narcotrend . In blinded-Narcotrend (NT) depth of anesthesia was extrapolated from clinical signs, hemodynamic response and anesthetic concentration, supplemented by target indices between 37 and 64 in the visible-NT group. Intraoperative norepinephrine requirement (primary endpoint), fluid balance, extubation time, delirium occurrence and adverse events were evaluated. Patients of the intent-to-treat population (visible-NT: n = 123, blinded-NT: n = 122) had similar patient and procedural characteristics. Adjusted for type of surgery intraoperative Norepinephrine application was significantly reduced in visible-NT (n = 120, robust mean of cumulative dose 4.71 microg/kg bodyweight) compared to blinded-NT patients (n = 119, 6.14 microg/kg bodyweight) (adjusted robust mean difference 1.71 (95% CI 0.33-3.10) microg/kg bodyweight). Although reduction in patients operated on cardiopulmonary bypass was higher the interaction was not significant in post-hoc subgroup analysis. Intraoperative fluid balance was similar among both groups and strata. Extubation time was non-significantly lower in visible than in blinded-NT group. Overall postoperative delirium risk was 16.4% without differences among the groups. Adverse events-sudden movement/coughing, perspiration or hypertension-occurred more often with visible-NT, while one blinded-NT patient experienced intraoperative awareness. Titration of depth of anesthesia in elective cardiac surgery patients using pEEG allows to reduce application of norepinephrine.
