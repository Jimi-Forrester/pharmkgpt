36678733|t|Selenium-Containing Agents Acting on Cancer-A New Hope?
36678733|a|Selenium-containing agents are more and more considered as an innovative potential treatment option for cancer. Light is shed not only on the considerable advancements made in understanding the complex biology and chemistry related to selenium-containing small molecules but also on Se-nanoparticles. Numerous Se-containing agents have been widely investigated in recent years in cancer therapy in relation to tumour development and dissemination, drug delivery, multidrug resistance (MDR) and immune system-related (anti)cancer effects. Despite numerous efforts, Se-agents apart from selenocysteine and selenomethionine have not yet reached clinical trials for cancer therapy. The purpose of this review is to provide a concise critical overview of the current state of the art in the development of highly potent target-specific Se-containing agents.
