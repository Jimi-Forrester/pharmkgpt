37900928|a|Of all complications from central venous catheters (CVC) in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients, catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) is one of the most devastating consequences. The option of catheter salvage is not an effective measure with metastatic infections. However, in patients with severe vasculopathy and/or near end-stage vascular disease, preservation of the venous access should be given utmost importance as the luxury of utilizing another vascular site is markedly limited. Providing adequate renal replacement therapy in this group of patients can be remarkably challenging for nephrologists. We are presenting an ESRD patient with advanced vascular disease who developed metastatic CRBSI with worsening uremia who was successfully converted from intermittent hemodialysis (IHD) to peritoneal dialysis (PD). Our rationale was to minimize repeated intravascular procedures coupled with the presence of another intravascular device. This has led to a complete resolution of persistent bacteremia, with a steady improvement in the uremic state. Conversion from IHD to PD for persistent bacteremia with metastatic complications was seldom addressed in literature. In the absence of a significant contraindication to PD, it can be considered as a valid alternative possibility in order to interrupt this viscous cycle, especially in vasculopathic patients.
