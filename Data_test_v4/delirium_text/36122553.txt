36122553|a|A variety of axes between brain and abdominal organs have been reported, but the interaction between brain and visceral white adipose tissue (vWAT) remains unclear. In this review, we summarized human studies on the association between brain and vWAT, and generalized their interaction and the underlying mechanisms according to animal and cell experiments. On that basis, we come up with the concept of the brain-vWAT axis (BVA). Furthermore, we analyzed the potential mechanisms of involvement of BVA in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), including vWAT-derived fatty acids, immunological properties of vWAT, vWAT-derived retinoic acid and vWAT-regulated insulin resistance. The proposal of BVA may expand our understanding to some extent of how the vWAT impacts on brain health and diseases, and provide a novel approach to study the pathogenesis and treatment strategies of neurodegenerative disorders.
