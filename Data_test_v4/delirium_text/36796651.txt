36796651|a|Recently, several studies have demonstrated that low-dose radiation (LDR) therapy has positively impacts on the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). LDR suppresses the production of pro-neuroinflammation molecules and improves cognitive function in AD. However, it is unclear whether direct exposure to LDR causes beneficial effects and what mechanism is involved in neuronal cells. In this study, we first determined the effect of high-dose radiation (HDR) alone on C6 cells and SH-SY5Y cells. We found that SH-SY5Y cells were more vulnerable than C6 cells to HDR. Moreover, in neuronal SH-SY5Y cells exposed to single or multiple LDR, N-type cells showed decreased cell viability with increasing radiation exposure time and frequency, but S-type cells were unaffected. Multiple LDR increased proapoptotic molecules such as p53, Bax and cleaved caspase-3, and decreased anti-apoptotic molecule (Bcl2). Multiple LDR also generated free radicals in neuronal SH-SY5Y cells. We detected a change in the expression of the neuronal cysteine transporter EAAC1. Pretreatment with N-acetylcysteine (NAC) rescued the increased in EAAC1 expression and the generation of ROS in neuronal SH-SY5Y cells after multiple LDR. Furthermore, we verified whether the increased in EAAC1 expression induces cell defense or cell death promotion signaling. We showed that transient overexpression of EAAC1 reduced the multiple LDR-induced p53 overexpression in neuronal SH-SY5Y cells. Our results indicate that neuronal cells can be injured by increased production of ROS not only by HDR but also by multiple LDR, which suggests that combination treatment with anti-free radical agents such as NAC may be useful in multiple LDR therapy.
