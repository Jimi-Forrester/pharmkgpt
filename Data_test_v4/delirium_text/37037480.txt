37037480|t|An update on renal fibrosis: from mechanisms to therapeutic strategies with a focus on extracellular vesicles.
37037480|a|The increasing prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major global public health concern. Despite the complicated pathogenesis of CKD, renal fibrosis represents the most common pathological condition, comprised of progressive accumulation of extracellular matrix in the diseased kidney. Over the last several decades, tremendous progress in understanding the mechanism of renal fibrosis has been achieved, and corresponding potential therapeutic strategies targeting fibrosis-related signaling pathways are emerging. Importantly, extracellular vesicles (EVs) contribute significantly to renal inflammation and fibrosis by mediating cellular communication. Increasing evidence suggests the potential of EV-based therapy in renal inflammation and fibrosis, which may represent a future direction for CKD therapy.
