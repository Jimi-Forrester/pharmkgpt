35572527|t|Monosodium Glutamate-Induced Mouse Model With Unique Diabetic Retinal Neuropathy Features and Artificial Intelligence Techniques for Quantitative Evaluation.
35572527|a|Objective: To establish an artificial intelligence-based method to quantitatively evaluate subtle pathological changes in retinal nerve cells and synapses in monosodium glutamate (MSG) mice and provide an effective animal model and technique for quantitative evaluation of retinal neurocytopathies. Methods: ICR mice were subcutaneously injected with MSG to establish a model of metabolic syndrome. We then established a mouse model of type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, and KKAy mouse model as control. The HE sections of the retina were visualized using an optical microscope. AI technology was used for quantitative evaluation of the retinal lesions in each group of rats. The surface area custom parameters of the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL), inner plexiform layer (IPL), inner nuclear layer (INL), and outer plexiform layer (OPL) were defined as SR, SIPL, SINL, and SOPL, respectively. Their heights were defined as HR, HIPL, HINL, and HOPL, and the number of ganglion cells was defined as A. Then, the attention-augmented fully convolutional Unet network was used to segment the retinal HE images, and AI technology to identify retinal neurocytopathies quantitatively. Results: The attention-augmented fully convolutional Unet network increased PA and IOU parameters for INL, OPL, RNFL, and ganglion cells and was superior in recognizing fine structures. A quantitative AI identification of the height of each layer of the retina showed that the heights of the IPL and INL of the MSG model were significantly less than those of the control groups; the retinas of the other diabetic models did not exhibit this pathological feature. The RNFLs of type 2 diabetes were thinner, and the characteristics of retinopathy were not obvious in the other animal models. The pathological changes seen on HE images were consistent with the results of the quantitative AI evaluation. Immunohistochemistry results showed that NMDAR2A, GluR2, and NRG1 were significantly downregulated in the retina of MSG mice. Conclusions: The MSG retinopathy model is closely associated with neurotransmitter abnormalities and exhibits important characteristics of retinal neurodegeneration, making it suitable for studying retinal neurocytopathies. The AI recognition technology for retinal images established in the present study can be used for the quantitative and objective evaluation of drug efficacy.
