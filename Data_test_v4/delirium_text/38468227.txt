38468227|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Multimorbidity, defined as the presence of two or more long-term health conditions in an individual, is one of the most significant challenges facing health systems worldwide. This study aimed to identify determinants of classes of multimorbidity among older adults in Iran. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In a cross-sectional sample of older adults (aged >= 60 years) from the second stage of the Bushehr Elderly Health (BEH) program in southern Iran, latent class analysis (LCA) was used to identify patterns of multimorbidity. Multinomial logistic regression was conducted to investigate factors associated with each multimorbidity class, including age, gender, education, household income, physical activity, smoking status, and polypharmacy. RESULTS: In 2,426 study participants (mean age 69 years, 52% female), the overall prevalence of multimorbidity was 80.2%. Among those with multimorbidity, 3 latent classes were identified. These comprised: class 1, individuals with a low burden of multisystem disease (56.9%); class 2, individuals with predominantly cardiovascular-metabolic disorders (25.8%) and class 3, individuals with predominantly cognitive and metabolic disorders (17.1%). Compared with men, women were more likely to belong to class 2 (odds ratio [OR] 1.96, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.52-2.54) and class 3 (OR 4.52, 95% CI 3.22-6.35). Polypharmacy was associated with membership class 2 (OR 3.52, 95% CI: 2.65-4.68) and class 3 (OR 1.84, 95% CI 1.28-2.63). Smoking was associated with membership in class 3 (OR 1.44, 95% CI 1.01-2.08). Individuals with higher education levels (59%) and higher levels of physical activity (39%) were less likely to belong to class 3 (OR 0.41; 95% CI: 0.28-0.62) and to class 2 (OR 0.61; 95% CI: 0.38-0.97), respectively. Those at older age were less likely to belong to class 2 (OR 0.95). DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: A large proportion of older adults in Iran have multimorbidity. Female sex, polypharmacy, sedentary lifestyle, and poor education levels were associated with cardiovascular-metabolic multimorbidity and cognitive and metabolic multimorbidity. A greater understanding of the determinants of multimorbidity may lead to strategies to prevent its development.
