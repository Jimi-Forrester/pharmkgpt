15635650|t|GRIN1 locus may modify the susceptibility to seizures during alcohol withdrawal.
15635650|a|N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, members of the glutamate receptor channel superfamily, are generally inhibited by alcohol. The expression and alternative splicing of the obligatory NR1 subunit is altered by alcohol exposure, emphasizing the involvement of the NR1 subunit, which is coded by the GRIN1 gene, in alcohol-mediated effects. We performed an association study in patients with alcohol dependence with the GRIN1 locus. Two independent case control samples consisting of a total of 442 alcohol-dependent patients and 442 unrelated controls were included. There was no overall difference in allele or genotype frequency between patients and controls. However, the 2108A allele and A-containing genotypes were over-represented in the patients with a history of withdrawal-induced seizures when compared to healthy volunteers (allele: chi(2) = 5.412, df = 1, P = 0.020) or an independent sample of patients without a history of seizures (allele: chi(2) = 4.185, df = 1, P = 0.041). Age at onset, years of alcohol dependence, and a history of delirium tremens did not differ between genotype or allele groups. These findings support the hypothesis that the GRIN1 locus may modify the susceptibility to seizures during alcohol withdrawal. This novel finding warrants replication.
