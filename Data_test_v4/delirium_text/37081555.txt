37081555|a|Understanding and treating Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been a remarkable challenge for both scientists and physicians. Although the amyloid-beta and tau protein hypothesis have largely explained the key pathological features of the disease, the mechanisms by which such proteins accumulate and lead to disease progression are still unknown. Such lack of understanding disrupts the development of disease-modifying interventions, leaving a therapeutic gap that remains unsolved. Nonetheless, the recent discoveries of the glymphatic pathway and the meningeal lymphatic system as key components driving central solute clearance revealed another mechanism underlying AD pathogenesis. In this regard, this narrative review integrates the glymphatic and meningeal lymphatic systems as essential components involved in AD pathogenesis. Moreover, it discusses the emerging evidence suggesting that nutritional supplementation, non-invasive brain stimulation, and traditional Chinese medicine can improve the pathophysiology of the disease by increasing glymphatic and/or meningeal lymphatic function. Given that physical exercise is a well-regarded preventive and pro-cognitive intervention for dementia, we summarize the evidence suggesting the glymphatic system as a mediating mechanism of the physical exercise therapeutic effects in AD. Targeting these central solute clearance systems holds the promise of more effective treatment strategies.
