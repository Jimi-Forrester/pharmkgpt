36986516|t|Automated Synthesis of [18F]Flumazenil Application in GABAA Receptor Neuroimaging Availability for Rat Model of Anxiety.
36986516|a|Clinical studies have demonstrated that the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptor complex plays a central role in the modulation of anxiety. Conditioned fear and anxiety-like behaviors have many similarities at the neuroanatomical and pharmacological levels. The radioactive GABA/BZR receptor antagonist, fluorine-18-labeled flumazenil, [18F]flumazenil, behaves as a potential PET imaging agent for the evaluation of cortical damage of the brain in stroke, alcoholism, and for Alzheimer disease investigation. The main goal of our study was to investigate a fully automated nucleophilic fluorination system, with solid extraction purification, developed to replace traditional preparation methods, and to detect underlying expressions of contextual fear and characterize the distribution of GABAA receptors in fear-conditioned rats by [18F]flumazenil. A carrier-free nucleophilic fluorination method using an automatic synthesizer with direct labeling of a nitro-flumazenil precursor was implemented. The semi-preparative high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) purification method (RCY = 15-20%) was applied to obtain high purity [18F]flumazenil. Nano-positron emission tomography (NanoPET)/computed tomography (CT) imaging and ex vivo autoradiography were used to analyze the fear conditioning of rats trained with 1-10 tone-foot-shock pairings. The anxiety rats had a significantly lower cerebral accumulation (in the amygdala, prefrontal cortex, cortex, and hippocampus) of fear conditioning. Our rat autoradiography results also supported the findings of PET imaging. Key findings were obtained by developing straightforward labeling and purification procedures that can be easily adapted to commercially available modules for the high radiochemical purity of [18F]flumazenil. The use of an automatic synthesizer with semi-preparative HPLC purification would be a suitable reference method for new drug studies of GABAA/BZR receptors in the future.
