35540351|t|Discovery of N-cyclobutylaminoethoxyisoxazole derivatives as novel sigma-1 receptor ligands with neurite outgrowth efficacy in cells.
35540351|a|Herein we reported a series of 14 novel derivatives based on the N-cyclobutylaminoethoxyisoxazole scaffold. In vitro binding studies of these compounds demonstrated their low nanomolar to subnanomolar potencies as sigma1 receptor ligands, with moderate to excellent selectivity over the sigma2 receptor as represented by compounds 17-30. The majority of the derivatives scored high (>4.7) in the CNS MPO appraisal system, indicating their high likelihood in penetrating the blood-brain barrier. A number of these compounds exhibited significant neurite outgrowth efficacy in N1E-115 neuronal cells and displayed excellent selectivity for sigma1 receptors over the selected endogenous neurotransmitter transporters, such as DAT, NET and SERT. Among the mini-series, compound 28 (K i sigma1 = 0.2 nM, K i sigma2 = 198 nM, CNS MPO score = 5.4) emerged as a promising selective sigma1 receptor ligand that warrants its further evaluation as a potential therapeutic for neurodegenerative diseases.
