35377629|t|Mechanism of Tripeptide Trimming of Amyloid beta-Peptide 49 by gamma-Secretase.
35377629|a|The membrane-embedded gamma-secretase complex processively cleaves within the transmembrane domain of amyloid precursor protein (APP) to produce 37-to-43-residue amyloid beta-peptides (Abeta) of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Despite its importance in pathogenesis, the mechanism of processive proteolysis by gamma-secretase remains poorly understood. Here, mass spectrometry and Western blotting were used to quantify the efficiency of tripeptide trimming of wild-type (WT) and familial AD (FAD) mutant Abeta49. In comparison to WT Abeta49, the efficiency of tripeptide trimming was similar for the I45F, A42T, and V46F Abeta49 FAD mutants but substantially diminished for the I45T and T48P mutants. In parallel with biochemical experiments, all-atom simulations using a novel peptide Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics (Pep-GaMD) method were applied to investigate the tripeptide trimming of Abeta49 by gamma-secretase. The starting structure was the active gamma-secretase bound to Abeta49 and APP intracellular domain (AICD), as generated from our previous study that captured the activation of gamma-secretase for the initial endoproteolytic cleavage of APP (Bhattarai, A., ACS Cent. Sci. 2020, 6, 969-983). Pep-GaMD simulations captured remarkable structural rearrangements of both the enzyme and substrate, in which hydrogen-bonded catalytic aspartates and water became poised for tripeptide trimming of Abeta49 to Abeta46. These structural changes required a positively charged N-terminus of endoproteolytic coproduct AICD, which could dissociate during conformational rearrangements of the protease and Abeta49. The simulation findings were highly consistent with biochemical experimental data. Taken together, our complementary biochemical experiments and Pep-GaMD simulations have enabled elucidation of the mechanism of tripeptide trimming of Abeta49 by gamma-secretase.
