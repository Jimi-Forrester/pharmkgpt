The purpose of this systematic review and narrative synthesis was to examine the experiences with caring for older people living with dementia at home. RESULTS: In total, 366 abstracts were identified and following screening, 19 studies were included in the synthesis. Six themes were identified: conceptualising dementia, caregiving arrangements, the impact of caregiving, caregiver identity and role, managing caregiving, unmet caregiver needs. CONCLUSION: There is a dearth of research in relation to caregiving for older people living with dementia in sub-Saharan Africa. There is need for better information campaigns and support programs directed at family and professional caregivers in this context.
