30950343|t|Using Small Peptide Segments of Amyloid-beta and Humanin to Examine their Physical Interactions.
30950343|a|BACKGROUND: Amyloid fibrils in Alzheimer's disease are composed of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides of variant lengths. Humanin (HN), a 24 amino acid residue neuroprotective peptide, is known to interact with the predominant Abeta isoform in the brain, Abeta (1-40). METHODS: Here, we constructed smaller segments of Abeta and HN and identified residues in HN important for both HN-HN and HN-Abeta interactions. Peptides corresponding to amino acid residues 5- 15 of HN, HN (5-15), HN (5-15, L11S), where Leu11 was replaced with Ser, and residues 17-28 of Abeta, Abeta (17-28), were synthesized and tested for their ability to block formation of the complex between HN and Abeta (1-40). RESULTS: Co-immunoprecipitation and binding kinetics showed that HN (5-15) was more efficient at blocking the complex between HN and Abeta (1-40) than either HN (5-15, L11S) or Abeta (17-28). Binding kinetics of these smaller peptides with either full-length HN or Abeta (1-40) showed that HN (5- 15) was able to bind either Abeta (1-40) or HN more efficiently than HN (5-15, L11S) or Abeta (17-28). Compared to full-length HN, however, HN (5-15) bound Abeta (1-40) with a weaker affinity suggesting that while HN (5-15) binds Abeta, other residues in the full length HN peptide are necessary for maximum interactions. CONCLUSION: L11 was more important for interactions with Abeta (1-40) than with HN. Abeta (17-28) was relatively ineffective at binding to either Abeta (1-40) or HN. Moreover, HN, and the smaller HN (5-15), HN (5-15 L11S), and Abeta (17-28) peptides, had different effects on regulating Abeta (1-40) aggregation kinetics.
