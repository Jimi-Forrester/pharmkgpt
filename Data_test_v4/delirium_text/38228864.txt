This research aims to delve deeper into the molecular process of the occurrence of the two diseases. We retrieved the gene expression profiles of AD (GSE5281) and AMI (GSE66360) from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Then, a total of 22 common differentially expressed genes (DEGs) including one downregulated gene and 21 upregulated genes were chosen for further analysis. Following the discovery of the common DEGs between AMI and AD, we performed protein-protein interaction analysis and hub gene identification analysis. Next, ten important hub genes were identified. Additionally, the key genes were identified by the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator and support vector machine-recursive feature elimination and multivariable logistic regression analysis. The BCL6 was identified to be the most connected with AMI and AD. Finally, the BCL6 gene was validated in the GSE40680 (AMI) and GSE122063 (AD) datasets. Our research indicates that AMI and AD share a comparable pathophysiology. The Hub genes, especially BCL6, were essential in developing AMI and AD. In addition, these hub genes and shared pathways can offer fresh perspectives for additional mechanism investigation.
