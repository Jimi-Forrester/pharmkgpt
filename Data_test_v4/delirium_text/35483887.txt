35483887|t|Delirium Tremens and Central Pontine Myelinolysis in a Patient with Alcohol Use Disorder and Pneumonia: a Case Report and a Narrative Review.
35483887|a|INTRODUCTION: Delirium tremens (DT) is a serious condition occurring in alcohol withdrawal syndrome. Alcohol consumption may also cause additional health problems, such as respiratory infections or neuropsychiatric conditions such as central pontine myelinolysis. In this clinical scenario, managing DT can be expected to be more compelling and complex. Alcohol decreases coughing and mucociliary clearance and disrupts the immunity of the respiratory system. CASE: Here we report on a middle-aged man with alcohol use disorder who had developed DT due to alcohol withdrawal and comorbid pneumonia. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: In this paper, DT, the relation between respiratory infections and alcohol intake, and the correlation of alcohol consumption and central pontine myelinolysis (CPM) are discussed. Also, the literature on alcohol consumption and the additional respiratory and neurologic problems resulting from it are presented.
