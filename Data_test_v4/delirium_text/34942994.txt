34942994|t|Ascorbic Acid Deficiency Prevalence and Associated Cognitive Impairment in Alcohol Detoxification Inpatients: A Pilot Study.
34942994|a|Malnutrition has been reported in alcohol use disorder patients as having a possible influence on cognitive function. The aim of this study was to analyse the prevalence of ascorbic acid (AA) deficiency in inpatients admitted for alcohol detoxification and the associated factors, including cognitive impairment in the early period of abstinence. A retrospective chart review was conducted. The AA level was categorised into three groups: deficiency (AAD) (<2 mg/L), insufficiency (AAI) (2-5 mg/L) and normal level. The cognitive impairment was screened using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Ninety-six patients were included (74 men; mean age 49.1 years (+-11.5)). Twenty-seven AAD (28.1%) and twenty-two AAI (22.9%) were observed. In multivariate analysis, risk factors for AAD versus normal AA level were men (OR 17.8, 95%CI (1.63-194)), compensated cirrhosis (OR 9.35, 95%CI (1.60-54.6)) and street homelessness (OR 5.76, 95%CI (1.24-26.8) versus personal housing). The MoCA score was available for 53 patients (mean MoCA score: 25.7 (+-3.3)). In multivariate analysis, the natural logarithm of AA (beta = 1.18, p = 0.037) and sedative use disorder (beta = -2.77, p = 0.046) were associated with the MoCA score. AAD and AAI are frequent in inpatients admitted for alcohol detoxification. A low level of AA was associated with cognitive impairment in the early period of abstinence.
