34222864|a|Recent case studies show that the SARS-CoV-2 infectious disease, COVID-19, is associated with accelerated decline of mental health, in particular, cognition in elderly individuals, but also with neurological and neuropsychiatric illness in young people. Recent studies also show a bidirectional link between COVID-19 and mental health in that people with previous history of psychiatric illness have a higher risk for contracting COVID-19 and that COVID-19 patients display a variety of psychiatric illnesses. Risk factors and the response of the central nervous system to the virus show large overlaps with pathophysiological processes associated with Alzheimer's disease, delirium, post-operative cognitive dysfunction and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, all characterized by cognitive impairment. These similarities lead to the hypothesis that the neurological symptoms could arise from neuroinflammation and immune cell dysfunction both in the periphery as well as in the central nervous system and the assumption that long-term consequences of COVID-19 may lead to cognitive impairment in the well-being of the patient and thus in today's workforce, resulting in large loss of productivity. Therefore, particular attention should be paid to neurological protection during treatment and recovery of COVID-19, while cognitive consequences may require monitoring.
