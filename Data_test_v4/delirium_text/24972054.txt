24972054|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia affecting the elderly. Neurodegeneration is caused by the amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide which is generated from the sequential proteolytic cleavage of the Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) by the beta- and gamma- secretases. Previous reports revealed that the 37 kDa/67 kDa laminin receptor (LRP/LR) is involved in APP processing, however, the exact mechanism by which this occurs remains largely unclear. This study sought to assess whether LRP/LR interacted with APP, beta- or gamma-secretase. Detailed confocal microscopy revealed that LRP/LR showed a strong co-localisation with APP, beta- and gamma-secretase, respectively, at various sub-cellular locations. Superresolution Structured Illumination Microscopy (SR-SIM) showed that interactions were unlikely between LRP/LR and APP and beta-secretase, respectively, while there was strong co-localisation between LRP/LR and gamma-secretase at this 80 nm resolution. FRET was further employed to assess the possibility of protein-protein interactions and only an interaction between LRP/LR and gamma-secretase was found. FLAG co-immunoprecipitation confirmed these findings as LRP/LR co-immunoprecipitated with gamma-secretase, but failed to do so with APP. These findings indicate that LRP/LR exerts its influence on Abeta shedding via a direct interaction with the gamma-secretase and possibly an indirect interaction with the beta-secretase.
