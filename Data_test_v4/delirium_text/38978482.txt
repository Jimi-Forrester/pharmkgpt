38978482|a|OBJECTIVES: This study explores the preferences and willingness-to-pay (WTP) of carers for Meeting Centres (MCs) attributes in assisting individuals with mild to moderate dementia. METHOD: Preferences from 108 carers, gathered through UK-wide MC networks, were collected using a Discrete Choice Experiment survey. The survey incorporated attributes derived from evidence synthesis and lay consultation. A regression model estimated preference weights and marginal WTP for a change in attributes one a time within the MC support 'package.' RESULTS: Carers preferred MCs offering a balanced mix of practical activities and emotional support, along with flexibility without booking requirements and low costs. Social opportunities and the frequency of the meeting were not prioritised. Respondents expressed a WTP of $43 to stay with 'My MC,' the preferred option, compared to transitioning to an alternative in-person MC, all else being equal. Various factors, including attendance modality, the relationship with the supported person, age, and gender, influenced carers' choices. CONCLUSION: These findings offer valuable insights into carers' preferences, priorities, and WTP within MC support for those with mild to moderate dementia. Understanding these factors can guide the implementation and sustainability of MCs, ensuring alignment with carers' needs and preferences and, ultimately, enhancing support for individuals with dementia.
