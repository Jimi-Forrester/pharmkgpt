29256351|t|The Emerging Role of Helicobacter Pylori-Induced Metabolic Gastrointestinal Dysmotility and Neurodegeneration.
29256351|a|Helicobacter pylori infection (Hp-I) is a prevalent disorder identified in the majority of the population in many countries around the world and is responsible for substantial gastrointestinal morbidity. Likewise, neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's diseases, multiple sclerosis or glaucoma defined as ocular Alzheimer's disease, are associated with a large public health burden and are among the leading causes of disability. Emerging evidences suggest that Hp-I may be associated with neurodegenerative conditions. Moreover, Hp-I could be a predictor of metabolic syndrome (MetS). Hp-I and its related MetS may induce gastrointestinal tract dys-motility disorders with systemic complications possibly including central nervous system neurodegenerative pathologies. We hereby explore the emerging role of Hprelated metabolic gastrointestinal dys-motilities on the molecular pathophysiology of Hprelated neurodegenerative and gastrointestinal disorders. Improving understanding of such Hp-I pathophysiology in brain pathologies may offer benefits by application of new relative therapeutic strategies including novel opportunities toward enhancing Hp eradication.
