38397424|t|LILRB4 Checkpoint for Immunotherapy: Structure, Mechanism and Disease Targets.
38397424|a|LILRB4, a myeloid inhibitory receptor belonging to the family of leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptors (LILRs/LIRs), plays a pivotal role in the regulation of immune tolerance. LILRB4 primarily mediates suppressive immune responses by transmitting inhibitory signals through immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs). This immune checkpoint molecule has gained considerable attention due to its potent regulatory functions. Its ability to induce effector T cell dysfunction and promote T suppressor cell differentiation has been demonstrated, indicating the therapeutic potential of LILRB4 for modulating excessive immune responses, particularly in autoimmune diseases or the induction of transplant tolerance. Additionally, through intervening with LILRB4 molecules, immune system responsiveness can be adjusted, representing significant value in areas such as cancer treatment. Thus, LILRB4 has emerged as a key player in addressing autoimmune diseases, transplant tolerance induction, and other medical issues. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of LILRB4, encompassing its structure, expression, and ligand molecules as well as its role as a tolerance receptor. By exploring the involvement of LILRB4 in various diseases, its significance in disease progression is emphasized. Furthermore, we propose that the manipulation of LILRB4 represents a promising immunotherapeutic strategy and highlight its potential in disease prevention, treatment and diagnosis.
