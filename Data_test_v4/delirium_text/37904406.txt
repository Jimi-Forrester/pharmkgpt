37904406|t|The impact of diabetes in cognitive impairment: A review of current evidence and prospects for future investigations.
37904406|a|Cognitive impairment in individuals with diabetes represents a multifaceted and increasingly prevalent health concern. This review critically examines the current evidence regarding the intricate relationship between diabetes and cognitive decline. It highlights the existing knowledge on the impact of diabetes on cognitive function, spanning from mild cognitive impairment to dementia, including vascular and Alzheimer dementia. The review underscores the need for a standardized diagnostic paradigm and explores research gaps, such as the implications of cognitive impairment in younger populations and various diabetes types. Furthermore, this review emphasizes the relevance of diabetes-related comorbidities, including hypertension and dyslipidemia, in influencing cognitive decline. It advocates for a comprehensive, interdisciplinary approach, integrating insights from neuroscience, endocrinology, and immunology to elucidate the mechanistic underpinnings of diabetes-related cognitive impairment. The second part of this review outlines prospective research directions and opportunities. It advocates for longitudinal studies to understand disease progression better and identifies critical windows of vulnerability. The search for accurate biomarkers and predictive factors is paramount, encompassing genetic and epigenetic considerations. Personalized approaches and tailored interventions are essential in addressing the substantial variability in cognitive outcomes among individuals with diabetes.
