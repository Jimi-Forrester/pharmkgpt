33553986|t|Vitamin D: Brain and Behavior.
33553986|a|It has been 20 years since we first proposed vitamin D as a "possible" neurosteroid.( 1 ) Our work over the last two decades, particularly results from our cellular and animal models, has confirmed the numerous ways in which vitamin D differentiates the developing brain. As a result, vitamin D can now confidently take its place among all other steroids known to regulate brain development.( 2 ) Others have concentrated on the possible neuroprotective functions of vitamin D in adult brains. Here these data are integrated, and possible mechanisms outlined for the various roles vitamin D appears to play in both developing and mature brains and how such actions shape behavior. There is now also good evidence linking gestational and/or neonatal vitamin D deficiency with an increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders, such as schizophrenia and autism, and adult vitamin D deficiency with certain degenerative conditions. In this mini-review, the focus is on what we have learned over these past 20 years regarding the genomic and nongenomic actions of vitamin D in shaping brain development, neurophysiology, and behavior in animal models.   2020 The Author.
