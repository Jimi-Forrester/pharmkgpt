33567053|t|Care for unplanned extubation prevention: analysis of the validity of an instrument's content.
33567053|a|OBJECTIVES: to analyze the validity of a nursing care instrument content for unplanned extubation prevention in Intensive Care Units. METHODS: a methodological study carried out with 40 nurses, containing 26 interventions distributed in the components: agitation/delirium/pain management; respiratory device stability; weaning from sedation and spontaneous breathing assessment; human resource management. Content Validity Index, average and universal proportion, and Fleiss' Kappa coefficient were applied. RESULTS: Brazilian female experts stood out, with an average age of 44.9 years and a standard deviation of 7.75 years. Two interventions did not reach a valid Content Validation Index (>=0.78), when considering the set of evaluated criteria. A universal agreement of 4.0% was identified among Brazilians and 26.6% among foreigners. CONCLUSIONS: the instrument is relevant and represents "unplanned extubation prevention in Intensive Care Units", which can be implemented in Brazil and in Latin countries, in Brazilian and foreign versions.
