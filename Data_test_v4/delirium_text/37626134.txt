37626134|a|Genomic imprinting disorders are caused by the disruption of genomic imprinting processes leading to a deficit or increase of an active allele. Their unique molecular mechanisms underlying imprinted genes offer an opportunity to investigate epigenetic-based therapy for reactivation of an inactive allele or reduction of an active allele. Current treatments are based on managing symptoms, not targeting the molecular mechanisms underlying imprinting disorders. Here, we highlight molecular approaches of therapeutic candidates in preclinical and clinical studies for individual imprinting disorders. These include the significant progress of discovery and testing of small molecules, antisense oligonucleotides, and CRISPR mediated genome editing approaches as new therapeutic strategies. We discuss the significant challenges of translating these promising therapies from the preclinical stage to the clinic, especially for genome editing based approaches.
