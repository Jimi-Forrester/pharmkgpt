31184004|a|INTRODUCTION: Hip fracture is considered the most serious consequence of falls and osteoporosis. 18% of women will suffer one and 25% die in the first year. Only 73% of survivors will walk as they did previously. We know little about the assistance and evolution of it in Mexico. Our goal was to review the current state of Mexican literature on hip fracture, compare Mexican studies with each other and with quality indicators. METHODS: We conducted a search of Mexican articles published between 2000-2017 with the key words: hip fracture, elderly, Mexico and hip fracture (in English) in the databases PubMed, EBSCO and Bibliomed. RESULTS: Twenty-one articles were included. No clinical trials, multidisciplinary unit reports, records, or meta-analyses were found. The average age was 76.9 years and 67.2% were women. No papers were found to report quality indicators. Comorbidity is reported little. The most common complications of hip fractures were delirium, pneumonia and pressure ulcers. Mortality in the acute phase was 0.97 to 12.5%. Special units were not reported. The cost of care oscillated between 1,261 and 13,641 USD. CONCLUSIONS: The scientific information on hip fractures in Mexico is sparse, heterogeneous and does not allow for conclusive results. Increasing the amount and quality of research in hip fractures in Mexico is required. It would also be advisable to disseminate the usefulness of multidisciplinary teams and registry of hip fractures, which would help to improve attention.
