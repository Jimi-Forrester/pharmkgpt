32743328|a|BACKGROUND: Given the association between geriatric syndrome and hospital readmission, we evaluated the suitability of geriatric syndrome screening for care (GSC) in identifying readmission risk and suggested the appropriate time for GSC. METHODS: GSC considering cognitive impairment, depression, polypharmacy (five or more medications), functional mobility, dysphagia, malnutrition, pain, and incontinence was performed among 2,663 general ward inpatients aged 65 years or older within 48 hours after admission and again before discharge between November 2016 and October 2017. From each patient, fall events, pressure ulcers, potentially inappropriate medication use, and delirium were assessed at admission. Patients were divided into two groups on the basis of readmission within 1 year after the first admission. According to the screening period (at admission and before discharge) and in-hospital decline, we applied receiver operating characteristic curve analysis to compare the prevalence of clinical concerns between the readmission and no-readmission groups. We also used multiple logistic regression analysis to evaluate the risk of readmission according to the presence of geriatric syndrome and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: The 782 readmitted patients (29.4%) showed a higher rate of poor GSC than those who were not readmitted. Polypharmacy at admission was significantly correlated with readmission risk (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve=0.602). Fall events (odds ratio [OR]=4.36; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.36-8.05), urinary incontinence (OR=4.21; 95% CI, 3.28-5.39), and depressive mood (OR=3.88; 95% CI, 2.69-5.59) at admission were risk factors for readmission. CONCLUSION: Geriatric syndromes assessed by GSC at admission was associated with an increased risk of readmission.
