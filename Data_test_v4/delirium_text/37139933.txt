37139933|a|OBJECTIVE: This umbrella review will synthesize evidence on the effectiveness of holistic assessment-based interventions in improving health outcomes in adults (aged >=18) with multiple long-term conditions and/or frailty. INTRODUCTION: Health systems need evidence-based effective interventions to improve health outcomes for adults with multiple long-term conditions. Holistic assessment-based interventions are effective in older people admitted to hospital (usually called "comprehensive geriatric assessments" in that context); however, the evidence is inconclusive on whether similar interventions are effective in community settings. INCLUSION CRITERIA: We will include systematic reviews examining the effectiveness of community and/or hospital holistic assessment-based interventions in improving health outcomes for community-dwelling and hospitalized adults aged >= 18 with multiple long-term conditions and/or frailty. METHODS: The review will follow the JBI methodology for umbrella reviews. MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL Plus, Scopus, ASSIA, Cochrane Library, and the TRIP Medical Database will be searched to identify reviews published in English from 2010 till the present. This will be followed by a manual search of reference lists of included reviews to identify additional reviews. Two reviewers will independently screen titles and abstracts against the selection criteria, followed by screening of full texts. Methodological quality will be assessed using the JBI Critical Appraisal Checklist for Systematic Reviews and Research Syntheses and data will be extracted using an adapted and piloted JBI data extraction tool. The summary of findings will be presented in tabular format, with narrative descriptions and visual indications. The citation matrix will be generated and the corrected covered area calculated to analyze the overlap in primary studies across the reviews. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION NUMBER: PROSPERO CRD42022363217.
