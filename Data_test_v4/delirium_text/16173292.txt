16173292|a|Dementia is a clinical syndrome characterised by acquired loss of cognitive and emotional abilities that interfere with activities of daily living. It is a disease of the older adults. The overall prevalence of dementia in developed countries has been reported to be between 5% and 10% after 60 or 65 years and older. India is the second largest populous country. The prevalence doubles with every five-year increase in age. Looking at some studies, it appears that the prevalence of dementia in India is lower as compared to developed countries and even from other developing countries. The probable reasons for lower prevalence in India are enumerated as: False negatives, low life expectancy, shorter survival and duration of disease, low age-specific incidence. Risk factors include greater age, female sex, less education, positive family history, Down's syndrome, stroke and its risk factors, head trauma with loss of conscionsness and thyroid diseases. Protective factors include higher education, APOE2 gene, intake of antioxidant substances, use of anti-inflammatory drugs, oestrogen supplements in women and also cigarette smoking (controversial). Alzheimer's disease has been found to be commonest cause of dementia. Patients of dementia require proper evaluation and management requires a multidisciplinary approach. The government and the social organisations should come forward and only a concerted effort of all people in every sphere of life will enable to tackle the new menace of this country.
