28101101|a|AIM: To determine predictive factors associated with rapid cognitive decline (RCD) in elderly patients suffering from Alzheimer disease (AD). METHODS: Patients suffering from mild to moderate AD were included. RCD was defined as the loss of at least 3 points on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) over 12 months. Factors associated with RCD were identified by logistic regression. RESULTS: Among 123 patients included, 61 were followed up until 12 months. RCD occurred in 46% of patients (n = 28). Polymedication (p < 0.0001), the fact that the caregiver was the child or spouse of the patient (p < 0.0001) and autonomy for washing (p < 0.0001) were protective factors against RCD, while the presence of caregiver burden (p < 0.0001) was shown to be a risk factor for RCD. CONCLUSION: Early detection of the RCD risk in AD patients could make it possible to anticipate the patient's medical needs and adjust the care plan for caregiver burden.
