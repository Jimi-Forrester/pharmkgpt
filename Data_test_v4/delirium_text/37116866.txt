37116866|t|The Direct and Long-Term Effects of Raloxifene as Adjunctive Treatment for Schizophrenia-Spectrum Disorders: A Double-Blind, Randomized Clinical Trial.
37116866|a|BACKGROUND AND HYPOTHESIS: Several studies suggest that raloxifene, a selective estrogen receptor modulator, improves symptoms and cognition in post-menopausal women with Schizophrenia-Spectrum Disorders (SSD). We aimed to assess the effects of adjunctive raloxifene in women and men with SSD. STUDY DESIGN: This parallel, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial included adult SSD patients across the Netherlands and Belgium. Participants were stratified by age, sex, and global functioning and randomly assigned 1:1 to 12-week add-on raloxifene or placebo. Primary outcomes were symptom severity at 6, 12, and 38 weeks and cognition at 12 and 38 weeks, as measured with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale and the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia, respectively. Intention-to-treat analyses were performed using linear mixed-effect models. STUDY RESULTS: We assessed 261 patients for eligibility, of which 102 (28% female) were assigned to raloxifene (n = 52) or placebo (n = 48). Although we found no main effect of raloxifene, secondary sex-specific analysis showed that in women, raloxifene had beneficial effects on negative symptoms at week 6 (LSM -2.92; adjusted P = 0.020) and week 12 (LSM -3.12; adjusted P = 0.030), and on working memory at week 38 (LSM 0.73; adjusted P = 0.040), while having negative effects on working memory at week 38 in men (LSM -0.53; adjusted P = 0.026). The number of adverse events was similar between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our results do not support the use of raloxifene in patients with SSD in general, but suggest female-specific beneficial effects of raloxifene on negative symptoms and working memory. Our findings encourage further research on sex-specific pharmacotherapeutic treatment.
