38910339|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease, which is mainly caused by the damage of the structure and function of the central nervous system. At present, there are many adverse reactions in market-available drugs, which can't significantly inhibit the occurrence of AD. Therefore, the current focus of research is to find safe and effective therapeutic drugs to improve the clinical treatment of AD. Oxidative stress bridges different mechanism hypotheses of AD and plays a key role in AD. Numerous studies have shown that natural flavonoids have good antioxidant effects. They can directly or indirectly resist -oxidative stress, inhibit Abeta aggregation and Tau protein hyperphosphorylation by activating Nrf2 and other oxidation-antioxidation-related signals, regulating synaptic function-related pathways, promoting mitochondrial autophagy, etc., and play a neuroprotective role in AD. In this review, we summarised the mechanism of flavonoids inhibiting oxidative stress injury in AD in recent years. Moreover, because of the shortcomings of poor biofilm permeability and low bioavailability of flavonoids, the advantages and recent research progress of nano-drug delivery systems such as liposomes and solid lipid nanoparticles were highlighted. We hope this review provides a useful way to explore safe and effective AD treatments.
