37287472|a|The key to stopping Alzheimer's disease (AD) lies in the pre-dementia stages, with the goal to stop AD before dementia has started. We present the rationale and design of the ABOARD (A Personalized Medicine Approach for Alzheimer's Disease) project, which aims to invest in personalized medicine for AD. ABOARD is a Dutch public-private partnership of 32 partners, connecting stakeholders from a scientific, clinical, and societal perspective. The 5-year project is structured into five work packages on (1) diagnosis, (2) prediction, (3) prevention, (4) patient-orchestrated care, and (5) communication and dissemination. ABOARD functions as a network organization in which professionals interact cross-sectorally. ABOARD has a strong junior training program "Juniors On Board." Project results are shared with society through multiple communication resources. By including relevant partners and involving citizens at risk, patients, and their care partners, ABOARD builds toward a future with personalized medicine for AD. Highlights: ABOARD (A Personalized Medicine Approach for Alzheimer's Disease) is a public-private research project executed by 32 partners that functions as a network organization.Together, the project partners build toward a future with personalized medicine for Alzheimer's disease.Although ABOARD is a Dutch consortium, it has international relevance.ABOARD improves diagnosis, prediction, prevention, and patient-orchestrated care.
