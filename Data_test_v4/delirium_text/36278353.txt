36278353|t|Associations of Naturally Occurring Antibodies to Presenilin-1 with Brain Amyloid-beta Load and Cognitive Impairment in Alzheimer's Disease.
36278353|a|BACKGROUND: Imbalance between the production and clearance of amyloid-beta (Abeta) promotes the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Presenilin-1 (PS1) is the catalytic subunit of gamma-secretase, which is involved in the process of Abeta production. The profiles of autoantibodies are dysregulated in AD patients. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the relative levels and clinical relevance of naturally occurring antibodies to PS1 (NAbs-PS1) in AD. METHODS: A total of 55 subjects with AD (including both dementia and mild cognitive impairment due to AD), 28 subjects with cognitive impairment (including both dementia and mild cognitive impairment) not due to AD (non-AD CI), and 70 cognitively normal (CN) subjects were recruited. One-site ELISA was utilized to determine the relative levels of NAbs-PS1 in plasma. RESULTS: AD subjects had lower plasma levels of NAbs-PS1 than CN and non-AD CI subjects. Plasma NAbs-PS1 were negatively associated with the brain Abeta load, as reflected by PET-PiB SUVR, and were positively associated with cognitive functions of participants. Plasma NAbs-PS1 discriminated AD patients from CN with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.730, a sensitivity of 69.09%, and a specificity of 67.14%, and they discriminated AD patients from non-AD CI subjects with an AUC of 0.750, a specificity of 70.91%, and a sensitivity of 71.43%. CONCLUSION: This study found an aberrant immunological phenotype in AD patients. Further investigations are needed to determine the pathophysiological functions of NAbs-PS1 in AD.
