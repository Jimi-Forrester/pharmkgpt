34602482|t|NPD1 Enhances Autophagy and Reduces Hyperphosphorylated Tau and Amyloid-beta42 by Inhibiting GSK3beta Activation in N2a/APP695swe Cells.
34602482|a|BACKGROUND: The most prevalent kind of dementia, Alzheimer's disease (AD), is a neurodegenerative disease. Previous research has shown that glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) is involved in the etiology and progression of AD, including amyloid-beta (Abeta), phosphorylated tau, and mitochondrial dysfunction. NPD1 has been shown to serve a neuroprotective function in AD, although the mechanism is unclear. OBJECTIVE: The effects of NPD1 on Abeta expression levels, tau protein phosphorylation, apoptosis ratio, autophagy activity, and GSK-3beta activity in N2a/APP695swe cells (AD cell model) were studied, as well as the mechanism behind such effects. METHODS: N2a/APP695swe cells were treated with NPD1, SB216763, or wortmannin as an AD cell model. The associated proteins of hyperphosphorylated tau and autophagy, as well as the activation of GSK3beta, were detected using western blot and RT-PCR. Flow cytometry was utilized to analyze apoptosis and ELISA was employed to observe Abeta42. Images of autophagy in cells are captured using transmission electron microscopy. RESULTS: In N2a/APP695swe cells, NPD1 decreased Abeta42 and hyperphosphorylated tau while suppressing cell death. NPD1 also promoted autophagy while suppressing GSK-3beta activation in N2a/APP695swe cells. The outcome of inhibiting GSK-3beta is comparable to that of NPD1 therapy. However, after activating GSK-3beta, the opposite experimental results were achieved. CONCLUSION: NPD1 might minimize cell apoptosis, downregulate Abeta expression, control tau hyperphosphorylation, and enhance autophagy activity in AD cell models to promote neuronal survival. NPD1's neuroprotective effects may be mediated via decreasing GSK-3beta.
