36483671|t|Imaging of the neurological manifestations of dengue: A case series.
36483671|a|Dengue fever, the most common arboviral tropical disease, has shown a rapid increase in incidence over the last few decades. Increasing evidence of the various neurological manifestations in dengue has been documented in the literature. Patients positive for dengue on serology and with neurological manifestations were analysed and included in the present case series and brief review. The cases reveal a spectrum of neurological findings in dengue infection and include dengue haemorrhagic encephalitis, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), reversible splenial lesion syndrome (RESLES), intracranial haematoma, and posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), with a focus on the relevant imaging features. Contribution: The present case series emphasises the importance of understanding the relevant imaging findings and potential aetiopathogenesis of neurological involvement in dengue infected patients in order to make the correct diagnosis for effective treatment and improved outcome.
