19513332|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cerebral white matter (WM) lesions are frequently observed in human cerebrovascular diseases, and are believed to be responsible for cognitive impairment. Various neuroprotective agents can suppress this type of WM or neuronal damage. In this study, we investigated whether citicoline, a drug used to treat acute ischemic stroke, can attenuate WM lesions and cognitive decline caused by chronic hypoperfusion in the rat. METHODS: Animals were divided into immediate- and delayed-treatment groups. Those in the immediate-treatment group received a sham operation, citicoline (500 mg/kg/day), or phosphate buffered saline (PBS) treatment. Citicoline or PBS was administered intraperitoneally for 21 days after occluding the bilateral common carotid arteries. Rats in the delayed-treatment group were intraperitoneally administered with either 500 mg/kg/day citicoline or PBS for 21 days beginning on the 8th day after the operation. From the 17th day of administration, the rats were placed in an eight-arm radial maze to examine their cognitive abilities. After completing the administration, tissues were isolated for Kluver-Barrera and the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase biotin-dUTP nick end labelling (TUNEL) staining. RESULTS: In the immediate-treatment group, cognitive functions were preserved in the citicoline-treated group, and WM damage and TUNEL-positive cells differed significantly between the citicoline- and PBS-treated animals. In the delayed-treatment group, there was no decrease in WM damage and TUNEL-positive cells, but cognitive improvement was evident for citicoline treatment relative to PBS treatment. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that citicoline can prevent WM damage and aid cognitive improvement, even after a certain extent of disease progression. Citicoline might be useful in patients with acute ischemic stroke as well as in chronic stroke accompanied with cognitive impairment.
