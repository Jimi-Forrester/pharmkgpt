34136634|a|INTRODUCTION: Hippocampal subfield volumes are more closely associated with cognitive impairment than whole hippocampal volume in many diseases. Both memory and whole hippocampal volume decline after stroke. Understanding the subfields' temporal evolution could reveal valuable information about post-stroke memory. METHODS: We sampled 120 participants (38 control, 82 stroke), with cognitive testing and 3T-MRI available at 3 months and 3 years, from the Cognition and Neocortical Volume after Stroke (CANVAS) study. Verbal memory was assessed using the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised. Subfields were delineated using FreeSurfer. We used partial Pearson's correlation to assess the associations between subfield volumes and verbal memory scores, adjusting for years of education, sex, and stroke side. RESULTS: The left cornu ammonis areas 2/3 and hippocampal tail volumes were significantly associated with verbal memory 3-month post-stroke. At 3 years, the associations became stronger and involved more subfields. DISCUSSION: Hippocampal subfield volumes may be a useful biomarker for post-stroke cognitive impairment.
