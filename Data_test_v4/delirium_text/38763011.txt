38763011|a|BACKGROUND: Aging is associated with learning and memory disorder, affecting multiple brain areas, especially the hippocampus. Previous studies have demonstrated trilobatin (TLB), as a natural food additive, can extend the life of Caenorhabditis elegans and exhibit neuroprotection in Alzheimer's disease mice. However, the possible significance of TLB in anti-aging remains elusive. PURPOSE: This study aimed to delve into the physiological mechanism by which TLB ameliorated aging-induced cognitive impairment in senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8 (SAMP8) mice. METHODS: 6-month-old SAMP8 mice were administrated with TLB (5, 10, 20 mg/kg/day, i.g.) for 3 months. The therapeutic effect of TLB on aging-induced cognitive impairment was assessed in mice using behavioral tests and aging score. The gut microbiota composition in fecal samples was analyzed by metagenomic analysis. The protective effects of TLB on blood-brain barrier (BBB) and intestinal barrier were detected by transmission electron microscope, H&E staining and western blot (WB) assay. The inhibitive effects of TLB on inflammation in brain and intestine were assessed using immunofluorescence, WB and ELISA assay. Molecular docking and surface plasma resonance (SPR) assay were utilized to investigate interaction between TLB and sirtuin 2 (SIRT2). RESULTS: Herein, the findings exhibited TLB mitigated aging-induced cognitive impairment, neuron injury and neuroinflammation in hippocampus of aged SAMP8 mice. Moreover, TLB treatment repaired imbalance of gut microbiota in aged SAMP8 mice. Furthermore, TLB alleviated the damage to BBB and intestinal barrier, concomitant with reducing the expression of SIRT2, phosphorylated levels of c-Jun NH2 terminal kinases (JNK) and c-Jun, and expression of MMP9 protein in aged SAMP8 mice. Molecular docking and SPR unveiled TLB combined with SIRT2 and down-regulated SIRT2 protein expression. Mechanistically, the potential mechanism of SIRT2 in TLB that exerted anti-aging effect was validated in vitro. As expected, SIRT2 deficiency attenuated phosphorylated level of JNK in HT22 cells treated with d-galactose. CONCLUSION: These findings reveal, for the first time, SIRT2-mediated brain-gut barriers contribute to aging and aging-related diseases, and TLB can rescue aging-induced cognitive impairment by targeting SIRT2 and restoring gut microbiota disturbance to mediate the brain-gut axis. Overall, this work extends the potential application of TLB as a natural food additive in aging-related diseases.
