39950093|a|Background: Immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) is a common complication of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy. Current practice guidelines recommend the immune effector cell-associated encephalopathy (ICE) score for the assessment and monitoring of ICANS. Objective: To demonstrate modifications to ICE score to patients with vision and hearing impairments or who are who are from non-native-speaking backgrounds. Methods: We discuss five cases and the modifications made to adapt the ICE score to meet patients' needs. Results: Modifications to ICE score was feasible and it assisted with CAR T cell therapy outcome monitoring. Discussion: These cases highlight the need for flexible and patient-tailored strategies and the importance of collaboration between multidisciplinary teams and patients' families/caregivers when monitoring patients for ICANS after CAR T-cell therapy.
