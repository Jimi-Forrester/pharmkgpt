34335912|a|Neuroinflammation is associated with many neurodegenerative diseases. Abnormal activation of microglial cells in the central nervous system (CNS) is a major characteristic of neuroinflammation. Nitric oxide (NO) free radicals are produced by activated microglia and prolonged presence of large quantities of NO in the CNS can lead to neuroinflammation and disease. Hispidin is a polyphenol derived from Phellinus linteus (a valuable medicinal mushroom) with strong antioxidant, anticancer and antidiabetic properties. A previous study demonstrated that hispidin significantly inhibited NO production via lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced RAW264.7 macrophages. Therefore, the present study used MTT assay was used to detect the effect of hispdin on cell viability. Griess reagent analysis was used to measure NO production. Reverse transcription-semi quantitative PCR and western blotting were used to evaluate the effects of hispdin on iNOS mRNA and MAPK/ERK/JNK protein levels. Fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry were used to detect the effects of hispdin on the production of ROS and phagocytosis of cells. The present results indicated that hispidin could significantly inhibit the increase of NO production and iNOS expression in BV-2 microglial cells stimulated by LPS. The inhibitory effect of hispidin on NO production was similar to that of S-methylisothiourea sulfate, an iNOS inhibitor. Signaling studies demonstrated that hispidin markedly suppresses LPS-induced mitogen activated protein kinases and JAK1/STAT3 activation, although not the NF-kappaB signaling pathway. The present observations in LPS-stimulated BV-2 microglial cells indicated that hispidin might serve as a therapeutic candidate for the treatment of NO-induced neuroinflammation and, potentially, as a novel iNOS inhibitor.
