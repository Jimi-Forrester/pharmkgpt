31796674|t|Why Is Amyloid-beta PET Requested After Performing CSF Biomarkers?
31796674|a|BACKGROUND: Amyloid-beta positron emission tomography (PET) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Abeta42 are considered interchangeable for clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. OBJECTIVE: To explore the clinical reasoning for requesting additional amyloid-beta PET after performing CSF biomarkers. METHODS: We retrospectively identified 72 memory clinic patients who underwent amyloid-beta PET after CSF biomarkers analysis for clinical diagnostic evaluation between 2011 and 2019. We performed patient chart reviews to identify factors which led to additional amyloid-beta PET. Additionally, we assessed accordance with appropriate-use-criteria (AUC) for amyloid-beta PET. RESULTS: Mean patient age was 62.0 (SD = 8.1) and mean Mini-Mental State Exam score was 23.6 (SD = 3.8). CSF analysis conflicting with the clinical diagnosis was the most frequent reason for requesting an amyloid-beta PET scan (n = 53, 74%), followed by incongruent MRI (n = 16, 22%), unusual clinical presentation (n = 11, 15%) and young age (n = 8, 11%). An amyloid-beta PET scan was rarely (n = 5, 7%) requested in patients with a CSF Abeta+/tau+ status. Fifteen (47%) patients with a post-PET diagnosis of AD had a predominantly non-amnestic presentation. In n = 11 (15%) cases, the reason that the clinician requested amyloid-beta was not covered by AUC. This happened most often (n = 7) when previous CSF analysis did not support current clinical diagnosis, which led to requesting amyloid-beta PET. CONCLUSION: In this single-center study, the main reason for requesting an amyloid-beta PET scan after performing CSF biomarkers was the occurrence of a mismatch between the primary clinical diagnosis and CSF Abeta/tau results.
