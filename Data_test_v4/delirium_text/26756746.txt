26756746|a|BACKGROUND: Cerebral beta-amyloid angiopathy (CAA) occurs when beta-amyloid (Abeta) is deposited in the vascular media and adventitia. It is a common pathology in the brains of older individuals and has been linked to cognitive decline, but relatively little is known about the influence that CAA has on the clinical manifestation of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The aim of this retrospective analysis was to quantify the effect that CAA had on the manifestation of initial AD-related cognitive change and subsequent progression of dementia. METHODS: We analyzed neuropathological data from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center's data set, performing parametric analyses to assess differences in age of progression to moderate-stage dementia. RESULTS: We found that individuals with both CAA burden and Abeta neuritic plaque burden at death had the greatest risk of earlier conversion to very mild and moderate-stage dementia, but not necessarily faster progression. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that CAA contributes to changes in early AD pathogenesis. This supports the idea that vascular change and neuritic plaque deposition are not just parallel processes but reflect additive pathological cascades that influence the course of clinical AD manifestation. Further inquiry into the role of CAA and its contribution to early cognitive change in AD is suggested.
