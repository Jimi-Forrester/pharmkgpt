39503417|a|Olfactory receptors are crucial for detecting odors and play a vital role in our sense of smell, influencing behaviors from food choices to emotional memories. These receptors also contribute to our perception of flavor and have potential applications in medical diagnostics and environmental monitoring. The ability of the olfactory system to regenerate its sensory neurons provides a unique model to study neural regeneration, a phenomenon largely absent in the central nervous system. Insights gained from how olfactory neurons continuously replace themselves and reestablish functional connections can provide strategies to promote similar regenerative processes in the central nervous system, where damage often results in permanent deficits. Understanding the molecular and cellular mechanisms underpinning olfactory neuron regeneration could pave the way for developing therapeutic approaches to treat spinal cord injuries and neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease. Olfactory receptors are found in almost any cell of every organ/tissue of the mammalian body. This ectopic expression provides insights into the chemical structures that can activate olfactory receptors. In addition to odors, olfactory receptors in ectopic expression may respond to endogenous compounds and molecules produced by mucosal colonizing microbiota. The analysis of the function of olfactory receptors in ectopic expression provides valuable information on the signaling pathway engaged upon receptor activation and the receptor's role in proliferation and cell differentiation mechanisms. This review explores the ectopic expression of olfactory receptors and the role they may play in neural regeneration within the central nervous system, with particular attention to compounds that can activate these receptors to initiate regenerative processes. Evidence suggests that olfactory receptors could serve as potential therapeutic targets for enhancing neural repair and recovery following central nervous system injuries.
