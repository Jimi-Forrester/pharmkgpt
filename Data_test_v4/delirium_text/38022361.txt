38022361|t|Healthy Drinking Water as a Necessity in Developing Countries Like India: A Narrative review.
38022361|a|Water is an indispensable part of human life. This article is an extensive review that focuses on the importance of water to sustain human life, the necessity of healthy, safe drinking water, and the health hazards of drinking untreated and contaminated water. We drink treated water thinking it to be safe without the knowledge that it, too, has harmful effects. Detrimental health effects due to water chlorination are mentioned in this article. The usage of nanoparticles for the treatment of water is an alternative to chlorination, but they are little in use as they are expensive. Transmission of waterborne diseases through drinking water is widespread in a developing country like India. A list of the pathogens contaminating drinking water is present in the review. Pathogens pollute water, and heavy metals and chemicals from industries, pesticides, pharmaceutical compounds, and radioactive waste also taint it. The harmful effects of metal and chemical toxicities on human health are discussed in this review. The government of India has launched several programmes to ensure clean, safe drinking water for all its residents. The study reflects on the treatment given to individuals suffering from waterborne diseases in India. Significant changes in health status in India have been seen recently after the execution of various government programmes to provide safe, healthy drinking water to all its residents.
