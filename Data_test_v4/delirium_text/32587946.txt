32587946|t|Sorting Out the Role of the Sortilin-Related Receptor 1 in Alzheimer's Disease.
32587946|a|Sortilin-related receptor 1 (SORL1) encodes a large, multi-domain containing, membrane-bound receptor involved in endosomal sorting of proteins between the trans-Golgi network, endosomes and the plasma membrane. It is genetically associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia. SORL1 is a unique gene in AD, as it appears to show strong associations with the common, late-onset, sporadic form of AD and the rare, early-onset familial form of AD. Here, we review the genetics of SORL1 in AD and discuss potential roles it could play in AD pathogenesis.
