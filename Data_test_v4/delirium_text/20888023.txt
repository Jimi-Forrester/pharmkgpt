20888023|t|[Sepsis associated encephalopathy].
20888023|a|The sepsis associated encephalopathy (SAE) is a common cause of delirium, accompanied by hyperthermia or not. It is defined as a diffuse cerebral dysfunction induced by the systemic response to the infection without clinical or laboratory evidence of direct infectious involvement of the central nervous system. It is, thus, a diagnosis of exclusion. The pathogenic mechanisms underlying SAE are now better understood: it involves, at least, an intense inflammation of the central nervous system and a major impairment of the blood brain barrier. At the present time, clinical, biological and radiological characteristics of SAE have been sufficiently described to ensure rapid identification, but prognosis remains severe. Proper management requires treatment as early as possible of the infectious site and accompanying systemic inflammatory response. When appropriately conducted, minimal consequences or complete recovery can be expected.
