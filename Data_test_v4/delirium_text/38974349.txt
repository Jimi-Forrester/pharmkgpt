38974349|t|Low Macular Pigment Optical Density Is Associated with Manifest Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma in Older Women.
38974349|a|Background: Lower density of carotenoids lutein and zeaxanthin (L/Z) in the macula (i.e., macular pigment) has been linked to greater risk for age-related eye disease. Objectives: We evaluated whether macular pigment optical density (MPOD) was associated with manifest primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) among older women in the Carotenoids in Age-Related Eye Disease Study 2 (CAREDS2). Methods: MPOD was measured with customized heterochromatic flicker photometry in women who attended CAREDS2 (2016-2019) and CAREDS1 (2001-2004) study visits. Manifest POAG at CAREDS2 was assessed using visual fields, disc photos, optical coherence tomography, and medical records. Age-adjusted linear and logistic regression models were used to investigate the cross-sectional association between POAG and MPOD at CAREDS2, and MPOD measured 15 years earlier at CAREDS1. Results: Among 426 CAREDS2 participants (mean age: 80 y; range: 69-98 y), 26 eyes with manifest POAG from 26 participants were identified. Glaucomatous eyes had 25% lower MPOD compared to nonglaucomatous eyes [mean (SE): 0.40 (0.05) compared with 0.53 (0.01)] optical density units (ODU), respectively (P = 0.01). Compared with MPOD quartile 1, odds for POAG were lower for women in quartiles 2-4 (P-trend = 0.01). After excluding eyes with age-related macular degeneration, associations were similar but not statistically significant (P-trend = 0.16). Results were similar for MPOD measured at CAREDS1. Conclusions: Our results add to growing evidence that low MPOD may be a novel glaucoma risk factor and support further studies to assess the utility of dietary interventions for glaucoma prevention.
