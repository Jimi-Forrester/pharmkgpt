30386622|t|Hydrocarbon pneumonitis caused by the inhalation of wood preservative.
30386622|a|A 69-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with acute dyspnoea, which developed after using a wood-preserving agent in an enclosed space. Burn injuries were evident on his face, neck, chest, and both upper arms. Bronchoalveolar lavage was carried out. The collected fluid resembled wood preservative. Subsequently, it was established that kerosene was a major component of the wood preservative. A diagnosis of hydrocarbon pneumonitis was established. The patient's respiratory and general findings improved with intensive care, which included mechanical ventilation. Corticosteroid was not required to aid his recovery. Aspiration and/or inhalation of hydrocarbon compounds, such as kerosene, turpentine, and gasoline, can cause acute and fatal pneumonitis. In managing cases of hydrocarbon pneumonitis, a prompt diagnosis and appropriate supportive care are important to achieve a good outcome.
