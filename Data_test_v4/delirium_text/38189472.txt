There is growing evidence that these two diseases are closely related. However, current research is still incomplete in understanding the common genes and common mechanisms between periodontitis and AD. In this study, we aimed to identify common genes in periodontitis and AD and analyze the relationship between crucial genes and immune cells to provide new therapeutic targets for clinical treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) specific to periodontitis and AD. Co-expressed genes were identified by obtaining gene expression profile data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Using the STRING database, protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were constructed, and essential genes were identified. We also used four algorithms to identify critical genes and constructed regulatory networks. The association of crucial genes with immune cells and potential therapeutic effects was also assessed. RESULTS: PDGFRB, VCAN, TIMP1, CHL1, EFEMP2, and IGFBP5 were obtained as crucial common genes. Immune infiltration analysis showed that Natural killer cells and Myeloid-derived suppressor cells were significantly differentially expressed in patients with PD and AD compared with the normal group. FOXC1 and GATA2 are important TFs for PD and AD. MiR-23a, miR-23b, miR-23a, and miR-23b were associated with AD and PD. Finally, the hub genes retrieved from the DSigDB database indicate multiple drug molecule and drug-target interactions. CONCLUSION: This study reveals commonalities in common hub genes and immune infiltration between periodontitis and AD, and the analysis of six hub genes and immune cells may provide new insights into potential therapeutic directions for the pathogenesis of periodontitis complicated by AD.
