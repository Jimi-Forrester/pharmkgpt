34846373|a|INTRODUCTION: Valproate is an antiepileptic medication that can be used to manage behavioral symptoms associated with Alzheimer's dementia. We present a rare case of valproate-induced periorbital edema. CASE: A 76-year-old man came to the emergency room with agitation and aggression. He was medically cleared and referred to a psychiatric facility where he was treated with haloperidol. When he developed drug-induced parkinsonism, the haloperidol was stopped, and the patient was started on valproate 250 mg twice daily. The day after valproate administration, the patient developed periorbital edema. After ruling out other causes of periorbital edema, adverse drug reaction was suspected. Valproate was discontinued, and the edema rapidly resolved within five days. CONCLUSION: Periorbital edema is a rare side effect of valproate. It can occur in patients who are being treated with valproate for behavioral changes in Alzheimer's disease. The edema resolves with discontinuation of the medication.
