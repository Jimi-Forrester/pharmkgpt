10683851|a|Amyloid beta protein ending at 42 (A beta 42) plays an important role in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here we show an increase in cellular A beta 42 in damaged neurons, with both ELISA and immunocytochemistry. The cellular A beta 42 increase was caused by 3-day treatments with H2O2, etoposide or melphalan, all of which induce genotoxic apoptosis, but not by treatment with sodium azide, which causes necrosis. Secreted A beta was similarly decreased with all these treatments. The cellular A beta 42 increase appeared even with minimal damage (ELISA) and A beta 42-positive cells were TUNEL negative (double staining), indicating that any early apoptosis mechanism may induce the cellular A beta 42 increase. Thus, neuronal apoptosis and cellular A beta 42 increase may be linked in a way that contributes importantly to AD pathology.
