37641911|t|Homocysteine and Parkinson's disease.
37641911|a|Homocysteine (Hcy) is an important metabolite in methionine metabolism. When the metabolic pathway of homocysteine is abnormal, it will accumulate in the body and eventually lead to hyperhomocysteinemia. In recent years, many studies have found that hyperhomocysteinemia is related to the occurrence and development of Parkinson's disease. This study reviews the roles of homocysteine in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease and illustrates the harmful effects of hyperhomocysteinemia on Parkinson's disease.
