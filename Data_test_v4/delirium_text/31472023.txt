31472023|t|Clinical outcomes of automated anastomotic devices: A metanalysis.
31472023|a|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: We investigated neurological events, graft patency, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), and mortality at 1 year following coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery using automated proximal anastomotic devices (APADs) and compared the overall rates with the current literature. METHODS: A systematic review of all available reports of APADs use in the literature was conducted. Cumulative incidence and 95% confidence interval (CI) were the main statistical indexes. Nine observational studies encompassing a total of 718 patients were included at the end of the selection process. RESULTS: The cumulative event rate of neurological complications was 4.8% (lower-upper limits: 2.8-8.0, P < .001; I2  = 72.907%, P = .002; Egger's test: intercept = -2.47, P = 0.16; Begg and Mazumdar test: tau = -0.20, p = 0.57). Graft patency was 90.5% (80.4 to 95.7, P < .001; I2  = 76.823%, P = .005; Egger's test: intercept = -3.04, P = .10; Begg and Mazumdar test: tau = -0.67, P = .17). Furthermore, the overall incidence of MACEs was 3.7% (1.3-10.4, P < .001; I2  = 51.556%, P = .103; Egger's test: intercept = -1.98, P =  < .11; Begg and Mazumdar test: tau = -0.67, P = .17). Finally, mortality within 1 year was 5% (3.5-7, P < .001; I2  = 29.675%, P = .202; Egger's test: intercept = -0.91, P = .62; Begg and Mazumdar test: tau = -0.04, P = .88). CONCLUSIONS: APADs do not seem to be correlated with a reduction of either neurological events or mortality. By contrast, these tools showed satisfactory one-year graft patency and a low incidence of MACEs. Further research on this topic is warranted.
