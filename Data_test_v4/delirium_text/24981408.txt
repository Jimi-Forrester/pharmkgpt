24981408|t|Tools for multiple granularity analysis of brain MRI data for individualized image analysis.
24981408|a|Voxel-based analysis is widely used for quantitative analysis of brain MRI. While this type of analysis provides the highest granularity level of spatial information (i.e., each voxel), the sheer number of voxels and noisy information from each voxel often lead to low sensitivity for detection of abnormalities. To ameliorate this issue, granularity reduction is commonly performed by applying isotropic spatial filtering. This study proposes a systematic reduction of the spatial information using ontology-based hierarchical structural relationships. The 254 brain structures were first defined in multiple (n=29) geriatric atlases. The multiple atlases were then applied to T1-weighted MR images of each subject's data for automated brain parcellation and five levels of ontological relationships were established, which further reduced the spatial dimension to as few as 11 structures. At each ontology level, the amount of atrophy was evaluated, providing a unique view of low-granularity analysis. This reduction of spatial information allowed us to investigate the anatomical features of each patient, demonstrated in an Alzheimer's disease group.
