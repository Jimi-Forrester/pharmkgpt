37873212|t|The Role of Ryanodine Receptor 2 in Drug-Associated Learning.
37873212|a|Type-2 ryanodine receptor (RyR2) ion channels facilitate the release of Ca 2+ from stores and serve an important function in neuroplasticity. The role for RyR2 in hippocampal-dependent learning and memory is well established and chronic hyperphosphorylation of RyR2 (RyR2P) is associated with pathological calcium leakage and cognitive disorders, including Alzheimer's disease. By comparison, little is known about the role of RyR2 in the ventral medial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) circuitry important for working memory, decision making, and reward seeking. Here, we evaluated the basal expression and localization of RyR2 and RyR2P in the vmPFC. Next, we employed an operant model of sucrose, cocaine, or morphine self-administration (SA) followed by a (reward-free) recall test, to reengage vmPFC neurons and reactivate reward-seeking and re-evaluated the expression and localization of RyR2 and RyR2P in vmPFC. Under basal conditions, RyR2 was expressed in pyramidal cells but not regularly detected in PV/SST interneurons. On the contrary, RyR2P was rarely observed in PFC somata and was restricted to a different subcompartment of the same neuron - the apical dendrites of layer-5 pyramidal cells. Chronic SA of drug (cocaine or morphine) and nondrug (sucrose) rewards produced comparable increases in RyR2 protein expression. However, recalling either drug reward impaired the usual localization of RyR2P in dendrites and markedly increased its expression in somata immunoreactive for Fos, a marker of highly activated neurons. These effects could not be explained by chronic stress or drug withdrawal and instead appeared to require a recall experience associated with prior drug SA. In addition to showing the differential distribution of RyR2/RyR2P and affirming the general role of vmPFC in reward learning, this study provides information on the propensity of addictive drugs to redistribute RyR2P ion channels in a neuronal population engaged in drug-seeking. Hence, focusing on the early impact of addictive drugs on RyR2 function may serve as a promising approach to finding a treatment for substance use disorders.
