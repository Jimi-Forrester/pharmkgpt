33786617|t|The potential role of necroptosis in clinical diseases (Review).
33786617|a|As an important type of programmed cell death in addition to apoptosis, necroptosis occurs in a variety of pathophysiological processes, including infections, liver diseases, kidney injury, neurodegenerative diseases, cardiovascular diseases, and human tumors. It can be triggered by a variety of factors, such as tumor necrosis factor receptor and Toll-like receptor families, intracellular DNA and RNA sensors, and interferon, and is mainly mediated by receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIP1), RIP3, and mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein. A better understanding of the mechanism of necroptosis may be useful in the development of novel drugs for necroptosis-related diseases. In this review, the focus is on the molecular mechanisms of necroptosis, exploring the role of necroptosis in different pathologies, discussing their potential as a novel therapeutic target for disease therapy, and providing suggestions for further study in this area.
