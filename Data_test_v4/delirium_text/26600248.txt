26600248|t|Structural Analysis and Aggregation Propensity of Pyroglutamate Abeta(3-40) in Aqueous Trifluoroethanol.
26600248|a|A hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the accumulation of extracellular amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques in the brains of patients. N-terminally truncated pyroglutamate-modified Abeta (pEAbeta) has been described as a major compound of Abeta species in senile plaques. pEAbeta is more resistant to degradation, shows higher toxicity and has increased aggregation propensity and beta-sheet stabilization compared to non-modified Abeta. Here we characterized recombinant pEAbeta(3-40) in aqueous trifluoroethanol (TFE) solution regarding its aggregation propensity and structural changes in comparison to its non-pyroglutamate-modified variant Abeta(1-40). Secondary structure analysis by circular dichroism spectroscopy suggests that pEAbeta(3-40) shows an increased tendency to form beta-sheet-rich structures in 20% TFE containing solutions where Abeta(1-40) forms alpha-helices. Aggregation kinetics of pEAbeta(3-40) in the presence of 20% TFE monitored by thioflavin-T (ThT) assay showed a typical sigmoidal aggregation in contrast to Abeta(1-40), which lacks ThT positive structures under the same conditions. Transmission electron microscopy confirms that pEAbeta(3-40) aggregated to large fibrils and high molecular weight aggregates in spite of the presence of the helix stabilizing co-solvent TFE. High resolution NMR spectroscopy of recombinantly produced and uniformly isotope labeled [U-15N]-pEAbeta(3-40) in TFE containing solutions indicates that the pyroglutamate formation affects significantly the N-terminal region, which in turn leads to decreased monomer stability and increased aggregation propensity.
