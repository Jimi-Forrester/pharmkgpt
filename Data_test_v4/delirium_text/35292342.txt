35292342|a|Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) has been involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), thus constituting a promising target for AD drug development. Positron emission tomography (PET) is a fully translational imaging technology, which will help us understand the role of HO-1 in the progression of AD, facilitating to validate promising HO-1 inhibitors in clinical trials. To our knowledge, there is no report on PET imaging probe targeting HO-1 in animals and humans. We report herein the synthesis and characterization of a 11C-labeled imidazole-based alcohol derivative ([11C]QC-33) for imaging of HO-1 in the brain. The desired product [11C]QC-33 was afforded with a radiochemical yield of 16 +- 9% (n = 3, decay corrected). The radiochemical purity was greater than 99%, and the molar radioactivity was greater than 185 GBq/mumol. In vitro autoradiography studies indicated specific binding of [11C]QC-33 in the HO-1 rich regions, showing 75%, 75%, and 69% radioactivity binding reductions in cerebellum, brain stem, and midbrain, respectively. PET/CT scanning in C57BL/6 mice showed low brain uptake and poor blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration of [11C]QC-33. These results suggested that [11C]QC-33 can serve as a lead compound to advance the development of next generation PET tracer with the potential to monitor HO-1 in AD progression.
