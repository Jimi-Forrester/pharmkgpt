38957260|a|Delirium is a significant public health concern, with tremendous implications for patient outcomes. Intensive care unit (ICU)-related delirium is gaining attention due to the higher prevalence of delirium in ICU-admitted patients. The most common negative outcomes of ICU delirium include cognitive impairments, functional dependence, high incidence of mortality, extended stay in the ICU, and high costs. So far, no single etiological factor has been identified as the sole cause of delirium. Several functional, neurotransmitter, or injury-causing hypotheses have been proposed for ICU delirium. Several risk factors contribute to the development of delirium in patients admitted to the ICU. These are age, gender, types of sedation, physical restraints, medical and surgical interventions, pain, and extended stay in the ICU. The most commonly used assessment modules for ICU delirium are the PREdiction of DELIRium in ICu patients (PRE-DELIRIC), Early PREdiction model for DELIRium in ICu patients (E-PRE-DELERIC), and Lanzhou Model, Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU), Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC), and Delirium Rating Scale (DRS). There is no proper treatment for ICU delirium; however, it can be managed through various pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. Healthcare providers should receive constant education and training on delirium recognition, prevention, and management to enhance patient care and outcomes in the ICU. Further research is needed on the effective prevention and management of ICU delirium.
