36277564|a|The neurotropism of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can potentially explain the worsening of symptoms in patients with a history of neurological conditions such as stroke, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's, and epilepsy. Several studies have reported that these pre-existing conditions may worsen with a higher frequency of flare-ups, thus resulting in a more significant risk of patient mortality. In this review, we sought to provide an overview of the relationship between pre-existing neurological disorders and COVID-19, focusing on whether the initial infection directly influenced the severity of symptoms. We systematically searched the electronic database PubMed (MEDLINE) and used specific keywords related to our aims from January 2020 to July 2022. All articles published on COVID-19 with keywords pertaining to pre-existing neurological diseases were retrieved and subsequently analyzed. After independent review, the data from 107 articles were selected and evaluated. After analyzing the data from selected articles reviewing the effect of COVID-19 on neurological conditions, we have documented the relationship between said pre-existing neurological diseases, showing an increased risk of hospitalization, admission length, worsening of symptoms, and even mortality in COVID-19 patients.
