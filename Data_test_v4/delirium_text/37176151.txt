37176151|t|Autoimmunity: A New Focus on Nasal Polyps.
37176151|a|Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) has long been considered a benign, chronic inflammatory, and hyperplastic disease. Recent studies have shown that autoimmune-related mechanisms are involved in the pathology of nasal polyps. Activated plasma cells, eosinophils, basophils, innate type 2 lymphocytes, mast cells, and proinflammatory cytokine in polyp tissue indicate the mobilization of innate and adaptive immune pathways during polyp formation. The discovery of a series of autoantibodies further supports the autoimmune nature of nasal polyps. Local homeostasis dysregulation, infection, and chronic inflammation may trigger autoimmunity through several mechanisms, including autoantigens overproduction, microbial translocation, molecular mimicry, superantigens, activation or inhibition of receptors, bystander activation, dysregulation of Toll-Like Receptors (TLRs), epitope spreading, autoantigens complementarity. In this paper, we elaborated on the microbiome-mediated mechanism, abnormal host immunity, and genetic changes to update the role of autoimmunity in the pathogenesis of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps.
