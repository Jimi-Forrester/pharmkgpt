36138324|t|Understanding why delirium is often missed in older emergency department patients: a qualitative descriptive study.
36138324|a|OBJECTIVES: Unrecognized delirium is associated with significant adverse outcomes. Despite decades of effort and educational initiatives, validated screening tools have not improved delirium recognition in the emergency department (ED). There remains a fundamental knowledge gap of why it is consistently missed. The objective of this study was to explore the perceptions of ED physicians and nurses regarding factors contributing to missed delirium in older ED patients. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative descriptive study at two academic tertiary care EDs in Toronto, Canada. Emergency physicians and nurses were interviewed by a trained qualitative researcher using a semi-structured interview guide. We coded transcripts with an iteratively developed codebook. Interviews were conducted until thematic saturation occurred. Thematic data analysis occurred in conjunction with data collection to continuously monitor emerging themes and areas for further exploration. RESULTS: We interviewed 26 ED physicians and nurses. We identified key themes at four levels: clinical practice, provider attitudes, systematic processes, and education. The four themes include: (1) there are varied approaches to delirium recognition and infrequent use of screening tools; (2) delirium assessment is perceived as overly time consuming and of lower priority than other symptoms and syndromes; (3) it is unclear whose responsibility it is to recognize delirium; and (4) there is a need for a deeper or "functional" understanding of delirium that includes its consequences. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate a need for ED leadership to identify clear team roles for delirium recognition, standardize use of delirium screening tools, and prioritize delirium as a symptom of an acute medical emergency.
