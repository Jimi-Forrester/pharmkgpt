33190765|a|Elderly patients who are critically ill have unique challenges that must be considered when attempting to prognosticate survival and determine expectations for physical rehabilitation and meaningful recovery. Furthermore, frail elderly patients present unique rehabilitation and clinical challenges when suffering from critical illness. There are multiple symptoms and syndromes that affect morbidity and mortality of elderly patients who require intensive care unit management including delirium, dementia, pain, and constipation. Rehabilitation goals should be based on patient values, clinical course, and functional status. Patients and families need accurate prognostic information to choose the appropriate level of care needed after critical illness.
