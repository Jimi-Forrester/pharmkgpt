32051088|t|S-Nitrosylation at the active site decreases the ubiquitin-conjugating activity of ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 D1 (UBE2D1), an ERAD-associated protein.
32051088|a|S-Nitrosylation of protein cysteine thiol is a post-translational modification mediated by nitric oxide (NO). The overproduction of NO causes nitrosative stress, which is known to induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. We previously reported that S-nitrosylation of protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) and the ER stress sensor inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1) decreases their enzymatic activities. However, it remains unclear whether nitrosative stress affects ER-associated degradation (ERAD), a separate ER stress regulatory system responsible for the degradation of substrates via the ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway. In the present study, we found that the ubiquitination of a known ERAD substrate, serine/threonine-protein kinase 1 (SGK1), is attenuated by nitrosative stress. C-terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein (CHIP) together with ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 D1 (UBE2D1) are involved in this modification. We detected that UBE2D1 is S-nitrosylated at its active site, Cys85 by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Furthermore, in vitro and cell-based experiments revealed that S-nitrosylated UBE2D1 has decreased ubiquitin-conjugating activity. Our results suggested that nitrosative stress interferes with ERAD, leading to prolongation of ER stress by co-disruption of various pathways, including the molecular chaperone and ER stress sensor pathways. Given that nitrosative stress and ER stress are upregulated in the brains of patient with Parkinson's disease (PD) and of those with Alzheimer's disease (AD), our findings may provide further insights into the pathogenesis of these neurodegenerative disorders.
