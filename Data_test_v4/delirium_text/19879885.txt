19879885|a|The goal of this study was to assess inhibition and goal maintenance in persons with Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment, healthy older adults and younger adults. This was done by using a task that compared the Stroop effect in pure blocks, that comprised only incongruent trials, with the Stroop effect in mixed blocks, in which 25% of trials were incongruent and 75% were congruent (Kane & Engle, 2003). Those conditions were administered to 20 healthy younger and 20 older control participants, and to 20 participants meeting criteria for MCI and 11 for AD. Results show reduced resistance to interference as a consequence of healthy aging and only partially impaired goal-maintenance capacities. Interference and goal maintenance are also impaired when comparing MCI and AD to healthy older adults, with AD suffering from a more severe impairment than MCI. In addition, there is a partial preservation of goal-maintenance capacities in MCI because reducing response speed allows them to maintain a level of error rate similar to that of healthy older adults. In contrast, AD persons suffer from a complete breakdown of goal-maintenance capacities, as is suggested by deficits on both response time and error rates.
