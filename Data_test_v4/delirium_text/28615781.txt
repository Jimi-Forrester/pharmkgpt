28615781|t|"Radio Inside My Head": A Curious Case of Early Onset "Stuck Song Syndrome" or Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder with Predominant Musical Obsession.
28615781|a|Musical obsessions also called "stuck song syndrome" is a topic of limited research. It is among the most poorly understood and rare phenomenology. There are only a few cases reported across the world which describes it. Subjects usually present with complaints of continuous play of a musical tune in the head which the subject is unable to remove. Because of its similarity in presentation with auditory musical hallucination, it presents a diagnostic dilemma to the clinician. Here, we present the case of a 25-year-old man who presented with this particular phenomenon, and the approach we took to manage it.
