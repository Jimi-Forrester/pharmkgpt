38841415|t|Gut microbiota: an ideal biomarker and intervention strategy for aging.
38841415|a|Population aging is a substantial challenge for the global sanitation framework. Unhealthy aging tends to be accompanied by chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer, which undermine the welfare of the elderly. Based on the fact that aging is inevitable but retarding aging is attainable, flexible aging characterization and efficient anti-aging become imperative for healthy aging. The gut microbiome, as the most dynamic component interacting with the organism, can affect the aging process through its own structure and metabolites, thus holding the potential to become both an ideal aging-related biomarker and an intervention strategy. This review summarizes the value of applying gut microbiota as aging-related microbial biomarkers in diagnosing aging state and monitoring the effect of anti-aging interventions, ultimately pointing to the future prospects of microbial intervention strategies in maintaining healthy aging.
