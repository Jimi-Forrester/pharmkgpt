36232218|a|The in-hospital mortality rate among patients after surgery for acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) has improved chronologically. However, the relationship between the incidence of hospitalisation-associated disability (HAD) and acute cardiac rehabilitation in patients after surgery for ATAAD has not been reported. Therefore, this study evaluated factors related to HAD in patients after surgery for ATAAD. This single-centre retrospective observational study included 483 patients who required emergency surgery for ATAAD. HAD occurred in 104 (21.5%) patients following cardiovascular surgery. Factors associated with HAD were age (odds ratio [OR], 1.05; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-1.09; p = 0.001), noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV; OR, 2.15; 95% CI, 1.10-4.19; p = 0.025), postoperative delirium (OR, 2.93; 95% CI, 1.60-5.37; p = 0.001), and timing of walking onset (OR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.07-1.56; p = 0.008). Furthermore, a late walking onset was associated with a higher risk of developing HAD and more severe functional decline. Early rehabilitation based on appropriate criteria has possibility of preventing HAD.
