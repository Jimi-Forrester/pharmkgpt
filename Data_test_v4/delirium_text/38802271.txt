38802271|a|BACKGROUND: Relapsed/refractory (R/R) central nervous system lymphomas (CNSLs) are associated with a poor prognosis. Relmacabtagene autoleucel (relma-cel), expressing the same chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) as lisocabtagene maraleucel, with an optimized commercial-ready process developed in China, demonstrated remarkable efficacy and manageable safety in the pivotal RELIANCE study. However, no published data are available on the "real-world" use of relma-cel, especially for patients with CNS involvement. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective analyses were conducted for commercial relma-cel used in patients with R/R CNSL at 12 clinics. The primary endpoint was to evaluate the proportion of patients who achieved complete response (CR) at 3 months. Secondary endpoints included best complete response (BCR), progression-free survival (PFS), duration of response (DOR), overall survival (OS), and the incidence of adverse events. RESULTS: Among the 22 CNSL patients (12 primary CNSLs; 10 secondary CNSLs), the best overall response rate was 90.9% and the BCR rate was 68.2%. With median follow-up of 316 days (range, 55-618 days), the estimated 1-year PFS rate, DOR, and OS rate were 64.4%, 71.5%, and 79.2%, respectively. Significant clinical benefits were observed in patients who were in durable CR or partial response to the most recent prior therapy preleukapheresis and received relma-cel as consolidation therapy (n=8), with 1-year PFS rate of 100.0% versus 41.7% (p=0.02). In addition, in terms of primary endpoint, non-CR at 3 months postinfusion seemed to be predictive of a worse prognosis, with an estimated 1-year PFS of 83.3% versus 37.0% (p=0.03), respectively. CRS occurred in 72.9% of patients (grade 3: 4.5%) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome in 36.4% of patients (grade 3: 4.5%). With the add-on agent PD-1 inhibitor (tislelizumab) to the ongoing BTKi, significant re-expansions of CAR T-cell were detected by quantitative PCR or flow cytometry after a median of 2 weeks (range, 12-32 days). CONCLUSIONS: This study was the first and largest real-world study of commercial relma-cel for R/R CNSL, demonstrating promising efficacy and acceptable safety. We reaffirmed the benefit of immuno-agents such as BTKi or PD-1 inhibitor on CAR T-cell re-expansion and hypothesized a dual-agent CAR-T related combinatorial therapies, which warrants further validation. Most importantly, we highlighted the earlier use of CAR T-cell therapy as a consolidative therapy for patients sensitive to salvage therapy, which provided an impetus and inspired-future strategy.
