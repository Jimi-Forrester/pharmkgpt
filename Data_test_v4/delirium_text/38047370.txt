38047370|a|Aim: 2-Thioxothiazolidin-4-one represents a versatile scaffold in drug development. The authors used it to prepare new potent acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) inhibitors that can be utilized, e.g., to treat Alzheimer's disease. Materials & methods: 3-Amino-2-thioxothiazolidin-4-one was modified at the amino group or active methylene, using substituted benzaldehydes. The derivatives were evaluated for inhibition of AChE and BChE (Ellman's method). Results & conclusion: The derivatives were obtained with yields of 52-94%. They showed dual inhibition with IC50 values from 13.15 muM; many compounds were superior to rivastigmine. The structure-activity relationship favors nitrobenzylidene and 3,5-dihalogenosalicylidene scaffolds. AChE was inhibited noncompetitively, whereas BChE was inhibited with a mixed type of inhibition. Molecular docking provided insights into molecular interactions. Each enzyme is inhibited by a different binding mode.
