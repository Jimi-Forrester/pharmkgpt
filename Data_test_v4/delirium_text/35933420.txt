35933420|t|Semaphorin 4D is upregulated in neurons of diseased brains and triggers astrocyte reactivity.
35933420|a|BACKGROUND: The close interaction and interdependence of astrocytes and neurons allows for the possibility that astrocyte dysfunction contributes to and amplifies neurodegenerative pathology. Molecular pathways that trigger reactive astrocytes may represent important targets to preserve normal homeostatic maintenance and modify disease progression. METHODS: Semaphorin 4D (SEMA4D) expression in the context of disease-associated neuropathology was assessed in postmortem brain sections of patients with Huntington's (HD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), as well as in mouse models of HD (zQ175) and AD (CVN; APPSwDI/NOS2-/-) by immunohistochemistry. Effects of SEMA4D antibody blockade were assessed in purified astrocyte cultures and in the CVN mouse AD model. CVN mice were treated weekly from 26 to 38 weeks of age; thereafter mice underwent cognitive assessment and brains were collected for histopathology. RESULTS: We report here that SEMA4D is upregulated in neurons during progression of neurodegenerative diseases and is a trigger of reactive astrocytes. Evidence of reactive astrocytes in close proximity to neurons expressing SEMA4D is detected in brain sections of patients and mouse models of HD and AD. We further report that SEMA4D-blockade prevents characteristic loss of GABAergic synapses and restores spatial memory and learning in CVN mice, a disease model that appears to reproduce many features of AD-like pathology including neuroinflammation. In vitro mechanistic studies demonstrate that astrocytes express cognate receptors for SEMA4D and that ligand binding triggers morphological variations, and changes in expression of key membrane receptors and enzymes characteristic of reactive astrocytes. These changes include reductions in EAAT-2 glutamate transporter and glutamine synthetase, key enzymes in neurotransmitter recycling, as well as reduced GLUT-1 glucose and MCT-4 lactate transporters, that allow astrocytes to couple energy metabolism with synaptic activity. Antibody blockade of SEMA4D prevented these changes and reversed functional deficits in glucose uptake. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these results suggest that SEMA4D blockade may ameliorate disease pathology by preserving normal astrocyte function and reducing the negative consequences of reactive astrogliosis.
