35703665|t|Aortic Intima Media Thickness is Increased and Closely Related to Elevated Oxidative Stress Increases in Beta Thalassemia Minor.
35703665|a|BACKGROUND: Abdominal aortic intima media thickness (A-IMT) may be an early marker of subclinical atherosclerosis and an objective indicator of increased oxidative stress in beta-thalassemia minor patients. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether aortic and carotid IMTs change with oxidative stress and to assess the relationship between these parameters in beta-thalassemia minor patients. METHODS: The study included 80 patients diagnosed with beta-thalassemia minor, and 50 healthy individuals with similar age and gender. After routine procedures, blood samples were collected from the study groups for thiol-disulfide hemostasis and ischemia-modified albumin (IMA). C-IMT measurements were performed in four different regions (right and left internal and external carotid artery) by ultrasonography. In addition, A-IMT measurement was performed by abdominal ultrasonography. Statistically significant p value was set as <0.05 for all comparisons. RESULTS: In beta-thalassemia minor patients, native thiol, total thiol and native thiol / total thiol ratio were lower, and the IMA, disulfide / native thiol ratio and disulfide / total thiol ratios were higher than in healthy control group. A-IMT measurement was significantly higher in beta-thalassemia minor group than controls (1.46+-0.37 vs 1.23+-0.22 and p<0.001). When the parameters associated with A-IMT in univariate analysis were evaluated by multivariate linear regression analysis, A-IMT was positively related, and native thiol and total thiol levels were negatively and closely related to IMA (p<0.01). CONCLUSION: We demonstrated, for the first time, that oxidative stress status increased with increased A-IMT, while C-IMT remained unchanged in beta-thalassemia minor patients.
