39126603|a|INTRODUCTION: GB-5001 is an intramuscular (IM) formulation of donepezil under development for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. The objective of this study was to develop a population pharmacokinetic (PK) model for donepezil in both IM and oral formulations, and to optimize the IM dosage of GB-5001 using bioequivalence (BE) simulation. METHODS: A population PK model of donepezil was developed using NONMEM. It was based on plasma concentration data from a Phase 1 dose escalation study, which involved a single administration of donepezil IM formulation at doses of 70, 140, and 280 mg, and the oral formulation at 10 mg. The model was evaluated based on goodness-of-fit plots, conditional weighted residuals, visual predictive checks, and bootstrapping. BE simulations were conducted using a parallel design between various doses of the IM formulation and the 10-mg dose of oral formulation. RESULTS: The PKs of donepezil were best described by a two-compartment model, which incorporated distinct absorption compartments for the IM (dual first-order absorption and simultaneous zero-order absorption with lag time) and oral (first-order absorption with lag time) formulations. Based on the simulation results, an IM dosage range of 210-215 mg in a sample size of over 92 was estimated to achieve a success rate of approximately 80% for BE. CONCLUSION: The population PK model well explained the PKs of donepezil following administration of both the IM and oral formulations. This model could be applied for the design and dose selection of future BE trials. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier, NCT05525780.
