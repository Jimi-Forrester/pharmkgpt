38004170|t|Sleeve Gastrectomy Provides Cardioprotection from Oxidative Stress In Vitro Due to Reduction of Circulating Myeloperoxidase.
38004170|a|Bariatric surgery, including sleeve gastrectomy (SG), improves systolic and diastolic function, which is independent of weight loss in rodent models. The cause of weight loss-independent improvements in cardiac function are unknown but may originate from the gastrointestinal tract. In this study, we investigated whether a circulating blood factor is a mechanism for acute cardioprotection after SG by testing the utility of rodent SG plasma to reduce metabolic stress in vitro. For the initial experiment, obese male Zucker rats underwent SG, ad lib sham, or pair-fed sham surgeries (n = six SG, n = eight SH, n = eight PF). For all other studies, a second group of Zucker rats underwent SG or ad lib sham surgeries (n = eight SH, n = six SG). Six weeks following surgery, plasma was collected from each group, both in the fasting and post-prandial (pp) state. This plasma was then pooled per surgical group and nutrient state and tested in multiple in vitro cell culture and extra-cellular assays to determine the effect of SG on myotubular metabolic stress compared to the sham surgeries. Post-prandial SG plasma (ppSG), but not fasting SG, pp, or fasting sham plasma, reduced the metabolic stress of the H9c2 cells as measured by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release (p < 0.01). Unlike SG, weight reduction through pair-feeding did not prevent H9c2 metabolic stress. The PpSG plasma had the slowest rate of extracellular hydrogen peroxide consumption and peroxidatic activity compared to the pp sham, fasting SG, and fasting sham groups. Redox testing of plasma with aminiobenzoic acid hydrazide and edaravone suggested a pattern supporting myeloperoxidase (MPO), or other peroxidases, as the primary component responsible for reduced metabolic stress with ppSG plasma. The PpSG plasma contained 35% less circulating MPO protein as compared to the pp sham and fasting SG plasma. The plasma from an MPO global knockout rat also prevented metabolic stress of the H9c2 cells, compared to the significant increase in LDH release from the plasma of the WT controls (p < 0.01). The MPO global knockout plasma also had a rate of extracellular hydrogen peroxide consumption and peroxidatic activity comparable to the ppSG plasma. These studies suggest that one of the weight loss-independent mechanisms by which SG improves myocellular function could be a reduced pro-oxidative environment due to lower circulating levels of MPO. It appears that the gastrointestinal tract is of critical importance to these findings, as the MPO levels were only lowered after enteral, nutrient stimulation in the SG rats. If this surgical effect is confirmed in humans, SG may be a unique surgical treatment for multiple diseases with a pathogenesis of inflammation and oxidative damage, including obesity-associated heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.
