39410092|t|Co-Encapsulation of Coffee and Coffee By-Product Extracts with Probiotic Kluyveromyces lactis.
39410092|a|Coffee and coffee by-products contain several chemical compounds of great relevance, such as chlorogenic acid (CGA), trigonelline, and caffeine. Furthermore, yeasts have been the target of studies for their use as probiotics because of their interesting biochemical characteristics. The combined administration of probiotic microorganisms with components that provide health benefits mediated by alginate encapsulation is an alternative that ensures the stability of cells and chemical compounds. In this context, the aim of this work was to co-encapsulate the probiotic yeast Kluyveromyces lactis B10 and extracts of green coffee beans, coffee silverskin, and PVA (black, green or immature, and sour coffee beans). The bioactive composition, antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of the extracts, microcapsule morphological characteristics and encapsulation efficiency, ability of the encapsulation to protect the yeast cells subjected to gastrointestinal conditions, and antioxidant activity of the microcapsules were evaluated. All the evaluated extracts showed antioxidant activity, of which PVA showed 75.7% and 77.0%, green coffee bean showed 66.4% and 45.7%, and coffee silverskin showed 67.7% and 37.4% inhibition of DPPH and ABTS + radicals, respectively, and antimicrobial activity against the pathogenic bacteria E. coli, Salmonella, and S. aureus, with high activity for the PVA extract. The microcapsules presented diameters of between 1451.46 and 1581.12 mum. The encapsulation efficiencies referring to the yeast retention in the microcapsules were 98.05%, 96.51%, and 96.32% for green coffee bean, coffee silverskin, and PVA, respectively. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed that the microcapsules of the three extracts presented small deformations and irregularities on the surface. The K. lactis cells encapsulated in all treatments with the extracts showed viability higher than 8.59 log CFU/mL, as recommended for probiotic food products. The addition of green coffee bean, coffee silverskin, and PVA extracts did not reduce the encapsulation efficiency of the alginate microcapsules, enabling a safe interaction between the extracts and the K. lactis cells.
