36827018|t|Full recovery of lung tissue after severe viral pneumonia H1N1: A case report with 10 years follow-up.
36827018|a|RATIONALE: World healthcare frequently faced severe viral pneumonia cases in the last decades, due to pandemic situations such as H1N1, MERS-CoV, and SARS-COVID-19. PATIENT CONCERNS: The impact of viral infection on lung structure, lung function, and overall mortality was significant. The quality of life and assumed life expectancy was decreased with the supposed development of lung fibrosis in involved survived patients. DIAGNOSES: We described the course and treatment of severe pneumonia H1N1 in a 30-year-old patient. INTERVENTIONS: Patient was included in a study regarding the therapeutic efficacy of selenium ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT02026856 with 10 years follow-up with concurrently documented X-ray lung examinations and final histology of lung tissue after sudden death. OUTCOMES: All sequential examinations and histological findings show a healing trend with the final full recovery of lung tissue.
