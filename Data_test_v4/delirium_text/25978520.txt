25978520|t|Nodulisporiviridins A-H, Bioactive Viridins from Nodulisporium sp.
25978520|a|Eight new viridins, nodulisporiviridins A-H (1-8), were isolated from the extract of an endolichenic fungal strain Nodulisporium sp. (No. 65-17-2-1) that was fermented with potato-dextrose broth. The structures were determined using spectroscopic and X-ray crystallographic analysis. Nodulisporiviridins A-D (1-4) are unique viridins with an opened ring A. The Abeta42 aggregation inhibitory activities of 1-8 were evaluated using a thioflavin T (ThT) assay with epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) as the positive control (EGCG IC50 of 0.5 muM). Nodulisporiviridin G (7) displayed potent inhibitory activity with an IC50 value of 1.2 muM, and the preliminary trend of activity of these viridins as Abeta42 aggregation inhibitors was proposed. The short-term memory assay on an Abeta transgenic drosophila model of Alzheimer's disease showed that all eight compounds improved the short-term memory capacity, with potencies close to that of the positive control (memantine).
