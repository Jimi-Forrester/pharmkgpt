38463084|a|The COVID-19 pandemic has not only burdened healthcare systems but has also led to a new emerging medical enigma that is post-COVID-19 syndrome or "long COVID." Characterized by persistent symptoms that extend beyond the acute phase of the illness, long COVID has rapidly become a public health concern with ambiguous neurological and neuropsychiatric dimensions. This narrative review aims at synthesizing available research to decode the long-term impacts of COVID-19 on neurological and mental health. Drawing from a multitude of studies, this review synthesizes evidence on various neuropsychiatric and neurological symptoms, including cognitive deficits, mood disorders, and more. The narrative delves into potential pathogenic mechanisms, hoping to fill existing research gaps and offering directions for future inquiry. The objective is not just academic; it has immediate real-world implications. Understanding these long-term effects is crucial for developing effective treatments and interventions, thereby better serving the millions of individuals living with these lingering symptoms. As healthcare systems continue to grapple with the fallout from the pandemic, this review provides much-needed context and insights into an area that demands urgent research and action.
