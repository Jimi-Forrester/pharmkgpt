18842206|a|The present article reviews the clinical principles of acute orthogeriatric care. The application of geriatric medicine to patients with hip fracture is explained. The principal stages of geriatric intervention in this process are mentioned, as are the interventions to be carried out by the geriatric team. Subsequently, we discuss the management of several frequent problems in these patients, such as high surgical risk, pain management, anaemia, delirium, malnutrition, and discharge planning. Lastly, the characteristics of several kinds of patients with special characteristics are mentioned, such as those diagnosed with dementia, nursing home residents or the oldest-old. Areas of improvement in the acute phase are also reviewed, such as mortality reduction, functional outcome improvement and the need for more efficient resource use in patients in the acute phase of hip fracture.
