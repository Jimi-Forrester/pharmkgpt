31012000|t|Anticholinesterase and Antioxidant Activity of New Binary Conjugates of gamma-Carbolines.
31012000|a|The synthesized new binary conjugates of tetrahydro-gamma-carbolines, which contained ditriazole spacers of different length, exhibited considerable anticholinesterase and antioxidant activity as well as the potential ability to block the acetylcholinesterase-induced aggregation of beta-amyloid in contrast to the original prototype Dimebon. This makes the compounds promising candidates for further investigation as drugs for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Special attention should be given to the conjugate containing the hexamethylene intertriazole spacer, which can be considered as a leader in this series of compounds.
