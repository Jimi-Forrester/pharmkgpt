However, whether preexisting mental health disorders increase the risk of ESKD is not well understood. The risk of incident ESKD in patients with or without underlying AD or DD was evaluated in a nationwide cohort of elderly people in Republic of Korea. METHODS: This study used data from the National Health Insurance Service-Senior cohort in Republic of Korea. Among the 558,147 total subjects, 49,634 and 54,231 were diagnosed with AD (AD group) or DD (DD group), respectively, during the follow-up period. Propensity score matching was conducted to create non-AD and non-DD groups of subjects. AD and DD diagnoses were analyzed as time-varying exposures, and the study outcome was development of ESKD. RESULTS: The incidence rates of ESKD were 0.36 and 1.17 per 1,000 person-years in the non-AD and AD groups, respectively. After adjustment for clinical variables and competing risks of death, the risk of incident ESKD was higher in the AD group than in the nonAD group (hazard ratio [HR], 1.67; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.34-2.08). The incidence rates of ESKD in the non-DD and DD groups were 0.36 and 0.91 per 1,000 person-years, respectively. The risk of ESKD development was also higher in the DD group than the non-DD group (HR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.19-1.76). CONCLUSION: The risk of ESKD development was higher in subjects diagnosed with AD or DD, suggesting that central nervous system diseases can adversely affect kidney function in elderly people.
