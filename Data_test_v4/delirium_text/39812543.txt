39812543|t|Addressing Healthy Aging: Time to Stop a Tsunami of Rising Alzheimer's Disease.
39812543|a|Alzheimer's disease [AD] disproportionately affects our seniors, diminishing their health and life expectancy. As the world population grows older, the collective burden of AD has become unsustainable. Globally, there were 43.8 million patients in 2016, with a projection of affecting 152 million by 2050. Recent discoveries have shown that molecular changes characteristic to AD manifested 20 years before discernable neurological phenotypes emerge. It is feasible to halt or reverse this pathological process before reaching an irremediable stage. To take advantage of this treatment window, we need to make rapid progress in early detection and monitoring, targeted implementation of preventative measures, invention of novel therapeutics, and pragmatic ramping-up of relevant supporting policies. PET is a powerful tool for prognosis. The utilization of AI technology, on the other hand, has favorable features of low cost per capita, easy dissemination and broad scale data collection to uncover previously unknown hotspots or risk factors. FDA approved drugs, lecanemab and donanemab, have started to show efficacy to put a pause on AD progression. Additional clinical data will enable comprehensive evaluation of the impacts of these drugs. Gene therapy holds the potential of eliciting long term protection, while several candidate loci have been identified. The urgency of a tsunami of rising AD epidemiology demands rapid actions on all fronts of advanced diagnostics, monitoring, preventative and interventive strategies.
