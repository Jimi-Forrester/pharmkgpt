8922063|a|The coexistence of polyglucosan bodies (PBs) and paired helical filaments (PHFs) in the same neuron is reported in an autopsy case of Alzheimer's disease. The patient was a 56-year-old Japanese male with a typical clinical course and pathological findings of Alzheimer's disease. Electron microscopically, numerous neurofibrillary tangles, mainly composed of PHFs, were observed in the neuronal cytoplasm, axons and dendrites. Some of them coexisted with other filamentous structures, which comprised randomly oriented branching filaments with a diameter of 5-10 nm. These structures were compatible with PBs. Glial tangles could not be found. Coexistence of these two structures was thought to occur in neurites.
