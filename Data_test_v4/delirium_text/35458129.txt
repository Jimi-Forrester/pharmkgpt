35458129|t|Magnesium Orotate and the Microbiome-Gut-Brain Axis Modulation: New Approaches in Psychological Comorbidities of Gastrointestinal Functional Disorders.
35458129|a|Magnesium orotate has been cited in the medical literature for the past three years as a possible adjuvant in some pediatric and adult gastroenterological disorders associated with dysbiosis. Studies also focus on the possibility of adding magnesium orotate in psychiatric disorders' treatment, such as major depression and anxiety. The most relevant element in these studies is the efficiency of magnesium orotate therapy in cases with both gastroenterological and psychiatric symptoms. This article proposes a literature review, focused on the studies published in the last three years, targeting magnesium orotate treatment and probiotic supplementation in patients with both digestive and psychiatric symptoms. Moreover, this review will compare the efficiency of magnesium orotate and probiotics within both the pediatric and adult communities, focusing on the possibility of gut-brain axis modulation and its involvement in the clinical evolution of these patients.
