38834823|a|A trendsetting direct competitive-based biosensing tool has been developed and implemented for the determination of the polyunsaturated fatty acid arachidonic acid (ARA), a highly significant biological regulator with decisive roles in viral infections. The designed methodology involves a competitive reaction between the target endogenous ARA and a biotin-ARA competitor for the recognition sites of anti-ARA antibodies covalently attached to the surface of carboxylic acid-coated magnetic microbeads (HOOC-MmicroBs), followed by the enzymatic label of the biotin-ARA residues with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (Strep-HRP) conjugate. The resulting bioconjugates were magnetically trapped onto the sensing surface of disposable screen-printed carbon transducers (SPCEs) to monitor the extent of the biorecognition reaction through amperometry. The operational functioning of the exhaustively optimized and characterized immunosensing bioplatform was highly convenient for the quantitative determination of ARA in serum samples from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2-) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-infected individuals in a rapid, affordable, trustful, and sensitive manner.
