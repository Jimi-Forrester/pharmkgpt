39049468|t|Olfactory Dysfunction as a Marker for Cognitive Impairment in General Paresis of the Insane: A Clinical Study.
39049468|a|BACKGROUND General paresis of the insane (GPI) is characterized by cognitive impairment, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and brain structural abnormalities, mimicking many neuropsychiatric diseases. Olfactory dysfunction has been linked to cognitive decline and neuropsychiatric symptoms in numerous neuropsychiatric diseases. Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether patients with GPI experience olfactory dysfunction and whether olfactory dysfunction is associated with their clinical manifestations. MATERIAL AND METHODS Forty patients with GPI and 37 healthy controls (HCs) underwent the "Sniffin Sticks" test battery, Mini-Mental State Examination, and Neuropsychiatric Inventory to measure olfactory function, cognitive function, and neuropsychiatric symptoms, respectively. Brain structural abnormalities were evaluated using visual assessment scales including the medial temporal lobe atrophy (MTA) visual rating scale and Fazekas scale. RESULTS Compared with HCs, patients with GPI exhibited significant olfactory dysfunction, as indicated by deficits in the odor threshold (OT) (P=0.001), odor discrimination (OD) (P<0.001), and odor identification (OI) (P<0.001). In patients with GPI, the OI was positively correlated with cognitive function (r=0.57, P<0.001), but no significant correlation was found between olfactory function and neuropsychiatric symptoms, blood, or cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers (rapid plasma reagin circle card test and Treponema pallidum particle agglutination test), or brain structural abnormalities (MTA and Fazekas scale scores). Mediation analysis indicated that the impaired OI in patients with GPI was mediated by cognitive impairment and impaired OT respectively. CONCLUSIONS Patients with GPI exhibited overall olfactory dysfunction. OI is correlated with cognitive function and the impaired OI is mediated by cognitive impairment in patients with GPI. Thus, OI may serve as a marker for reflecting cognitive function in patients with GPI.
