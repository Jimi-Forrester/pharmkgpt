22229327|t|Kinetic study on the effects of extremely low frequency electromagnetic field on catalase, cytochrome P450 and inducible nitric oxide synthase in human HaCaT and THP-1 cell lines.
22229327|a|Extremely low frequency electromagnetic fields (ELF-EMF) have been found to produce a variety of biological effects. These effects of ELF-EMF depend upon frequency, amplitude, and length of exposure, and are also related to intrinsic susceptibility and responsiveness of different cell types. Although the mechanism of this interaction is still obscure, ELF-EMF can influence cell proliferation, differentiation, cell cycle, apoptosis, DNA replication and protein expression. The aim of this study was to estimate various kinetic constants of catalase, cytochrome P450 and inducible nitric oxide synthase in response to ELF-EMF exposure in human HaCaT and THP-1 cell lines. In order to evaluate the effect of ELF-EMF on the modulation of cellular responses to an inflammatory stimulus, both cell lines were treated with lipopolysaccharide. To the best of our knowledge there is no available report on such type of kinetic study of selected enzymes in response to ELF-EMF in these cell lines. Therefore, the current study may reveal novel mechanism of ELFEMF biological interaction with the enzymological and hormonal systems of living organisms. These new insights may be important for ELF-EMF application particularly for wound healing, tissue regeneration, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases.
