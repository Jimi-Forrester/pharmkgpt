30584561|t|Intravascular Hemolysis following Acute Zinc Phosphide Poisoning; a Case Report.
30584561|a|Zinc phosphide (ZnP) is low-cost, accessible, and very effective as a rodenticide. It has been used for many human suicide poisonings around the world, including Iran. Nonspecific gastrointestinal symptoms and cardiotoxicity are the most serious complications of ZnP poisoning, which are associated with a high mortality rate. The aim of this paper was to report a poisoned patient that ingested ZnP with suicidal attempt and faced complications due to hemolysis.
