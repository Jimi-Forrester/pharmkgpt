9180219|t|T/G polymorphism at intron 9 of presenilin 1 gene is associated with, but not responsible for sporadic late-onset Alzheimer's disease in Japanese population.
9180219|a|To investigate whether presenilin 1 (PS1) gene, a major causative gene of familial early-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD), also contributes to the etiology of sporadic AD, we evaluated associations between Japanese AD and polymorphisms located at 14q24.3. While the D14S43 and FOS loci showed no association with either early- or late-onset AD, late-onset AD carrying no APOE-epsilon4 allele was associated with the G allele of the T/G polymorphism located at intron 9 of the PS1 gene (P = 0.016). Considering another study showing a positive association between AD and the T allele, this polymorphism is associated with, but not responsible for sporadic late-onset Alzheimer's disease.
