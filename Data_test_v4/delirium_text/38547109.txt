38547109|t|Disulfide-constrained peptide scaffolds enable a robust peptide-therapeutic discovery platform.
38547109|a|Peptides present an alternative modality to immunoglobulin domains or small molecules for developing therapeutics to either agonize or antagonize cellular pathways associated with diseases. However, peptides often suffer from poor chemical and physical stability, limiting their therapeutic potential. Disulfide-constrained peptides (DCP) are naturally occurring and possess numerous desirable properties, such as high stability, that qualify them as drug-like scaffolds for peptide therapeutics. DCPs contain loop regions protruding from the core of the molecule that are amenable to peptide engineering via direct evolution by use of phage display technology. In this study, we have established a robust platform for the discovery of peptide therapeutics using various DCPs as scaffolds. We created diverse libraries comprising seven different DCP scaffolds, resulting in an overall diversity of 2 x 1011. The effectiveness of this platform for functional hit discovery has been extensively evaluated, demonstrating a hit rate comparable to that of synthetic antibody libraries. By utilizing chemically synthesized and in vitro folded peptides derived from selections of phage displayed DCP libraries, we have successfully generated functional inhibitors targeting the HtrA1 protease. Through affinity maturation strategies, we have transformed initially weak binders against Notch2 with micromolar Kd values to high-affinity ligands in the nanomolar range. This process highlights a viable hit-to-lead progression. Overall, our platform holds significant potential to greatly enhance the discovery of peptide therapeutics.
