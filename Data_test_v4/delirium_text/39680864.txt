39680864|t|The Octadecanoids: Synthesis and Bioactivity of 18-Carbon Oxygenated Fatty Acids in Mammals, Bacteria, and Fungi.
39680864|a|The octadecanoids are a broad class of lipids consisting of the oxygenated products of 18-carbon fatty acids. Originally referring to production of the phytohormone jasmonic acid, the octadecanoid pathway has been expanded to include products of all 18-carbon fatty acids. Octadecanoids are formed biosynthetically in mammals via cyclooxygenase (COX), lipoxygenase (LOX), and cytochrome P450 (CYP) activity, as well as nonenzymatically by photo- and autoxidation mechanisms. While octadecanoids are well-known mediators in plants, their role in the regulation of mammalian biological processes has been generally neglected. However, there have been significant advancements in recognizing the importance of these compounds in mammals and their involvement in the mediation of inflammation, nociception, and cell proliferation, as well as in immuno- and tissue modulation, coagulation processes, hormone regulation, and skin barrier formation. More recently, the gut microbiome has been shown to be a significant source of octadecanoid biosynthesis, providing additional biosynthetic routes including hydratase activity (e.g., CLA-HY, FA-HY1, FA-HY2). In this review, we summarize the current field of octadecanoids, propose standardized nomenclature, provide details of octadecanoid preparation and measurement, summarize the phase-I metabolic pathway of octadecanoid formation in mammals, bacteria, and fungi, and describe their biological activity in relation to mammalian pathophysiology as well as their potential use as biomarkers of health and disease.
