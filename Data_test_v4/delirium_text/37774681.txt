37774681|a|Cellular perturbations underlying Alzheimer's disease (AD) are primarily studied in human postmortem samples and model organisms. Here, we generated a single-nucleus atlas from a rare cohort of cortical biopsies from living individuals with varying degrees of AD pathology. We next performed a systematic cross-disease and cross-species integrative analysis to identify a set of cell states that are specific to early AD pathology. These changes-which we refer to as the early cortical amyloid response-were prominent in neurons, wherein we identified a transitional hyperactive state preceding the loss of excitatory neurons, which we confirmed by acute slice physiology on independent biopsy specimens. Microglia overexpressing neuroinflammatory-related processes also expanded as AD pathology increased. Finally, both oligodendrocytes and pyramidal neurons upregulated genes associated with beta-amyloid production and processing during this early hyperactive phase. Our integrative analysis provides an organizing framework for targeting circuit dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and amyloid production early in AD pathogenesis.
