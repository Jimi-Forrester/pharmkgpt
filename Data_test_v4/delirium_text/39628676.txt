39628676|t|Maternal mitochondrial DNA copy number and methylation as possible predictors of pregnancy outcomes in a Michigan pregnancy cohort.
39628676|a|Little is understood about the roles of mitochondria in pregnancy-related adaptations. Therefore, we evaluated associations of maternal early-to-mid pregnancy mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtDNAcn) and mtDNA methylation with birth size and gestational length. Michigan women (n = 396) provided venous bloodspots at median 11 weeks gestation to quantify mtDNAcn marker NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase chain 1 (ND1) using real-time quantitative PCR and mtDNA methylation at several regions within four mitochondria-specific genes using pyrosequencing: MTTF (mitochondrially encoded tRNA phenylalanine), DLOOP (D-loop promoter region, heavy strand), CYTB (cytochrome b), and LDLR (D-loop promoter region, light strand). We abstracted gestational length and birthweight from birth certificates and calculated birthweight z-scores using published references. We used multivariable linear regression to evaluate associations of mtDNAcn and mtDNA methylation with birthweight and birthweight z-scores. Cox Proportional Hazards Models (PHMs) and quantile regression characterized associations of mitochondrial measures with gestational length. We also considered differences by fetal sex. Using linear regression and Cox PHMs, mtDNAcn was not associated with birth outcomes, whereas associations of mtDNA methylation with birth outcomes were inconsistent. However, using quantile regression, mtDNAcn was associated with shorter gestation in female newborns at the upper quantiles of gestational length, but with longer gestational length in males at the lower quantiles of gestational length. Maternal LDLR, DLOOP, and MTTF methylation was associated with longer gestational length in females at the upper quantiles and in males at lower gestational length quantiles. Maternal mtDNAcn and mtDNA methylation were associated with gestational length in babies born comparatively early or late, which could reflect adaptations in mitochondrial processes that regulate the length of gestation.
