33230465|t|Overexpression of circRNA circUCK2 Attenuates Cell Apoptosis in Cerebral Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury via miR-125b-5p/GDF11 Signaling.
33230465|a|Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are expressed at high levels in the brain and are involved in various central nervous system diseases. However, the potential role of circRNAs in ischemic stroke-associated neuronal injury remains largely unknown. Herein, we uncovered the function and underlying mechanism of the circRNA UCK2 (circUCK2) in ischemia stroke. The oxygen-glucose deprivation model in HT-22 cells was used to mimic ischemia stroke in vitro. Neuronal viability and apoptosis were determined by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assays and TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end labeling) staining, respectively. Middle cerebral artery occlusion was conducted to evaluate the function of circUCK2 in mice. The levels of circUCK2 were significantly decreased in brain tissues from a mouse model of focal cerebral ischemia and reperfusion. Upregulated circUCK2 levels significantly decreased infarct volumes, attenuated neuronal injury, and improved neurological deficits. circUCK2 reduced oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD)-induced cell apoptosis by regulating transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta)/mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 3 (Smad3) signaling. Furthermore, circUCK2 functioned as an endogenous miR-125b-5p sponge to inhibit miR-125b-5p activity, resulting in an increase in growth differentiation factor 11 (GDF11) expression and a subsequent amelioration of neuronal injury. Consequently, these findings showed that the circUCK2/miR-125b-5p/GDF11 axis is an essential signaling pathway during ischemia stroke. Thus, the circRNA circUCK2 may serve as a potential target for novel treatment in patients with ischemic stroke.
