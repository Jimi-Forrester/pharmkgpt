34527500|t|Successful Leadless Pacemaker Implantation in an Elderly Patient With Dextrocardia and Situs Inversus.
34527500|a|Leadless pacemaker is indicated in patients with symptomatic bradycardia as an alternative therapy when transvenous pacemaker implantation is considered difficult or at high risk. The experience of implanting leadless pacemaker in patients with dextrocardia and situs inversus is limited. A 94-year-old male was transferred to our hospital due to advanced atrio-ventricular block with episode of syncope. Chest radiograph and computed tomography revealed dextrocardia with situs inversus. Emergency cardiac catheterization was performed and a temporary pacemaker was inserted, but the patient removed it due to delirium. So, a leadless pacemaker was implanted to him. Shorter time of bed-rest after the implantation and shorter hospital stay would be beneficial of implanting a leadless pacemaker. Precise anatomical evaluation would be important to perform implantation efficiently and safely.
