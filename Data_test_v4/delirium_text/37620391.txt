37620391|a|Although ablations are performed with conscious sedation or general anesthesia, microwave ablations can be painful post procedure. Newer analgesic modalities, including regional blocks, have promoted the proliferation of less invasive anesthesia care for ablative procedures. This study evaluates whether bilateral paravertebral blocks reduce the need for additional analgesics in comparison to unilateral blocks in microwave ablations. In this retrospective study, individuals undergoing microwave ablation who underwent unilateral versus bilateral nerve blocks at a single institution from 2017 to 2019 were compared. Categorical variables were analyzed using Pearson's chi-squared tests. Comparisons of means were completed using multiple T-tests corrected using the Holm-Sidak method with alpha = 0.05. Regression modeling was used to identify factors related to increased MME (milligram morphine equivalent) usage and post-procedure admission rates. A total of 106 patients undergoing 112 liver MWA procedures were included in this analysis, with patients receiving either a bilateral or unilateral block. Pre-procedural characteristics demonstrated no significant differences in age or gender. Bilateral blocks were associated with decreased usage of gabapentin (14% vs. 0%, p = 0.01) and a lower rate of post-procedure admissions (OR 0.23, p = 0.003). Therefore, when using paravertebral blocks, bilateral blocks are superior to unilateral blocks, as demonstrated by decreased rates of hospital admission and reduced use of systemic neuropathic pain medication. Additionally, reducing post-procedural MME may reduce the rate of admission to the hospital.
