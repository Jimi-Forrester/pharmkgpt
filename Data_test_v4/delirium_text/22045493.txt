22045493|a|Alzheimer's disease encompasses multiple risk factors; convergence may be necessary for clinical manifestation. Mice received a complete diet or one lacking folate and vitamin E and containing iron as a pro-oxidant, in a standard environment (SE) or a large cage containing objects to stimulate exploration/activity (enriched environment; EE). Mice declined in maze navigation on the deficient versus complete diet in the SE but not the EE. Mice on the complete diet demonstrated superior performance in the EE versus SE. The EE reduced brain lipid and protein oxidation. These findings suggest that maintaining nutrition and activity may delay age-related cognitive decline.
