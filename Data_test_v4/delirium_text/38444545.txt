38444545|t|What is the association of polypharmacy with frailty in heart failure? A systematic review and meta-analysis.
38444545|a|This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to explore the differences in the number of prescribed medications and polypharmacy risk between patients with heart failure (HF) and frailty vs. those with HF but without frailty. Eligible studies included observational or experimental studies in patients aged >=50 years. Thirteen studies met the criteria and were included in the final analysis. Patients with frailty and HF exhibited a higher risk of polypharmacy (OR: 1.87, 95% CI 1.72 - 2.04, I2 = 0%, P < 0.01) compared to those without frailty. Results remained significant after adjusting for comorbidity status. Additionally, patients with frailty and HF were prescribed more medications compared to those without (k = 6; MD: 1.43, 95% CI 0.31 - 2.55, I2 = 94%, P = 0.01), with a high degree of heterogeneity. However, results were non-significant after adjustment for comorbidity status. Patients with HF and frailty have a higher need of polypharmacy compared to those without frailty, which may increase the risk of potentially inappropriate medications (PIM). Investigating the real-world prevalence of PIM may support clinicians in their routine assessment as part of a comprehensive management strategy in patients with HF and frailty.
