37580467|a|The endosomal-lysosomal system (ELS), which carries out cellular processes such as cellular waste degradation via autophagy, is essential for cell homeostasis. ELS inefficiency leads to augmented levels of damaged organelles and intracellular deposits. Consequently, the modulation of autophagic flux has been recognized as target to remove damaging cell waste. Recently, we showed that cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1 (CysLTR1) antagonist application increases the autophagic flux in the retinal pigment epithelial cell line ARPE-19. Consequently, we investigated the effect of CysLTR1 inhibition-driven autophagy induction on aggregated proteins in ARPE-19 cells using flow cytometry analysis. A subset of ARPE-19 cells expressed CysLTR1 on the surface (SE+); these cells showed increased levels of autophagosomes, late endosomes/lysosomes, aggregated proteins, and autophagy as well as decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation. Furthermore, CysLTR1 inhibition for 24 h using the antagonist zafirlukast decreased the quantities of autophagosomes, late endosomes/lysosomes, aggregated proteins and ROS in CysLTR1 SE- and SE+ cells. We concluded that high levels of plasma membrane-localized CysLTR1 indicate an increased amount of aggregated protein, which raises the rate of autophagic flux. Furthermore, CysLTR1 antagonist application potentially mimics the physiological conditions observed in CysLTR1 SE+ cells and can be considered as strategy to dampen cellular aging.
