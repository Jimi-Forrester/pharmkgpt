35350400|t|Cerebral Autoregulation Indices Are Not Interchangeable in Patients With Sepsis.
35350400|a|Introduction: Dynamic cerebral autoregulation (dCA) is frequently altered in patients with sepsis and may be associated with sepsis-associated brain dysfunction. However, the optimal index to quantify dCA in patients with sepsis is currently unknown. Objective: To assess the agreement between two validated dCA indices in patients with sepsis. Methods: Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data in patients with sepsis; those with acute or chronic intracranial disease, arrhythmias, mechanical cardiac support, or history of supra-aortic vascular disease were excluded. Transcranial Doppler was performed on the right or left middle cerebral artery (MCA) with a 2-MHz probe, and MCA blood flow velocity (FV) and arterial pressure (BP) signals were simultaneously recorded. We calculated two indices of dCA: the mean flow index (Mxa), which is the Pearson correlation coefficient between BP and FV (MATLAB, MathWorks), and the autoregulation index (ARI), which is the transfer function analysis of spontaneous fluctuations in BP and FV (custom-written FORTRAN code). Impaired dCA was defined as Mxa >0.3 or ARI <= 4. The agreement between the two indices was assessed by Cohen's kappa coefficient. Results: We included 95 patients (age 64 +- 13 years old; male 74%); ARI was 4.38 [2.83-6.04] and Mxa was 0.32 [0.14-0.59], respectively. There was no correlation between ARI and Mxa (r = -0.08; p = 0.39). dCA was altered in 40 (42%) patients according to ARI and in 50 (53%) patients according to Mxa. ARI and Mxa were concordant in classifying 23 (24%) patients as having impaired dCA and 28 (29%) patients as having intact dCA. Cohen's kappa coefficient was 0.08, suggesting poor agreement. ARI was altered more frequently in patients on mechanical ventilation than others (27/52, 52% vs. 13/43, 30%, p = 0.04), whereas Mxa did not differ between those two groups. On the contrary, Mxa was altered more frequently in patients receiving sedatives than others (23/34, 68% vs. 27/61, 44%, p = 0.03), whereas ARI did not differ between these two groups. Conclusions: Agreement between ARI and Mxa in assessing dCA in patients with sepsis was poor. The identification of specific factors influencing the dCA analysis might lead to a better selection of the adequate cerebral autoregulation (CAR) index in critically ill patients with sepsis.
