32604799|t|HNG, A Humanin Analogue, Promotes Hair Growth by Inhibiting Anagen-to-Catagen Transition.
32604799|a|The hair follicle goes through repetitive cycles including anagen, catagen, and telogen. The interaction of dermal papilla cells (DPCs) and keratinocytes regulates the hair cycle and hair growth. Humanin was discovered in the surviving brain cells of patients with Alzheimer's disease. HNG, a humanin analogue, activates cell growth, proliferation, and cell cycle progression, and it protects cells from apoptosis. This study was performed to investigate the promoting effect and action mechanisms of HNG on hair growth. HNG significantly increased DPC proliferation. HNG significantly increased hair shaft elongation in vibrissa hair follicle organ culture. In vivo experiment showed that HNG prolonged anagen duration and inhibited hair follicle cell apoptosis, indicating that HNG inhibited the transition from the anagen to catagen phase mice. Furthermore, HNG activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk)1/2, Akt, and signal transducer and activator of transcription (Stat3) within minutes and up-regulated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels on DPCs. This means that HNG could induce the anagen phase longer by up-regulating VEGF, which is a Stat3 target gene and one of the anagen maintenance factors. HNG stimulated the anagen phase longer with VEGF up-regulation, and it prevented apoptosis by activating Erk1/2, Akt, and Stat3 signaling.
