38863738|a|Purpose: This study aims to investigate whether dexmedetomidine could prevent postoperative cognitive dysfunction and delirium in patients with lobectomy. Patients and Methods: Patients with lung cancer who underwent thoracoscopic lobectomy under general anesthesia were enrolled in this study and divided into dexmedetomidine group or control group. Propensity-score match (PSM) was used to reduce the bias and imbalance of confounding variables. After PSM, 87 patients in each group were included. Primary outcomes were postoperative cognitive function and delirium. Secondary outcomes include plasma TNF-alpha, IL-6, and S100 beta protein concentrations. Adverse events were also collected. Results: There were no significant differences in the demographic characteristics and hemodynamic parameters between the two groups. Compared with the control group, the MoCA scores were significantly higher (P<0.01), while the incidence of delirium (P<0.01) and the plasma TNF-alpha (P<0.01), IL-6 (P<0.01), and S100 beta protein (P<0.01) concentrations were significantly lower in the dexmedetomidine group at 7 days post-operatively. The incidences of adverse events were similar between the two groups. Conclusion: Dexmedetomidine could prevent postoperative cognitive dysfunction and delirium in patients with lobectomy by decreasing neuroinflammation.
