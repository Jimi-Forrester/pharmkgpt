26141264|a|BACKGROUND: Amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) has become an important tool to identify amyloid-beta (Abeta) pathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Here, we determined the diagnostic value of the amyloid PET tracer [(18)F]flutemetamol in relation to Abeta pathology at autopsy. METHODS: [(18)F]flutemetamol PET was carried out in a cohort of 68 patients included in a [(18)F]flutemetamol amyloid PET imaging end-of-life study (GE067-007). At autopsy, AD pathology was determined and Abeta plaque pathology was classified into phases of its regional distribution (0-5). RESULTS: [(18)F]flutemetamol PET was universally positive in cases with advanced stage postmortem Abeta pathology (Abeta phases 4 and 5). Negative amyloid PET was universally observed in nondemented or non-AD dementia cases with initial Abeta phases 1 and 2, whereas 33.3% of the phase 3 cases were positive. CONCLUSIONS: [(18)F]flutemetamol amyloid PET detects primarily advanced stages of Abeta pathology in preclinical and symptomatic AD cases.
