25286470|a|Human magnesium deficiency states are known to be associated with tremor, choreiform and athetoid movements, delirium and convulsions. In order to assess a recent report of altered magnesium metabolism in Huntington's chorea, 6 patients with the disease have been studied with complete balance studies, exchangeable magnesium studies, erythrocyte and ultrafiltrable magnesiums and 2 patients with spinal fluid magnesium determinations. Balance studies failed to suggest any abnormalities. Exchangeable magnesium28 values were within normal ranges (4.3 +- 0.7 mEq./Kg. at 24 hrs.), as were erythrocyte magnesium determinations (5.29 +- 0.42 mEq./L.). Ultrafiltrable magnesiums were normal and the 2 spinal fluids evaluated had normal magnesium values. These results are not compatible with the hypothesis of altered magnesium metabolism in Huntington's chorea.
