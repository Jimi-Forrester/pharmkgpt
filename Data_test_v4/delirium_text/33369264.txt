The aim of this study was to determine the effect of pandemic on anxiety and depression in Iranian population. METHODS: An online cross-sectional study was conducted for the general public and healthcare workers in Iran using a questionnaire comprised of demographic questions and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Chi-square test and univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were conducted. RESULTS: Of the 2045 participants, 1136 (65.6%) were considered to have moderate and severe anxiety symptoms, and 865 (42.3%) had moderate and severe depression symptoms. The prevalence of anxiety was higher in the females than in the males (OR = 1.4, 95% CI: 1.123-1.643, P = .002); the prevalence of anxiety was significantly higher in those aged 30-39 years than in other age-groups (OR = 1.6, 95% CI: 1.123-2.320, P = .001); furthermore, the prevalence of anxiety and depression was significantly higher in doctors and nurses compared with other occupations ((OR = 1.9, 95% CI: 1.367-2.491, P < .001) and (OR = 1.5, 95% CI: 1.154-2.021, P = .003)). In addition, the prevalence of anxiety symptoms in the likely infected COVID-19 group was higher than in the noninfected COVID-19 group (OR = 1.35, 95% CI: 1.093-1.654, P = .005).
