29921399|t|Prediction of length of hospital stay and mortality in patients with delirium: a prospective cohort analysis of 200 ICU patients.
29921399|a|Delirium develops in most critically ill Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients and is associated with longer hospital stay, increased rate of mortality and increased cost of healthcare. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the incidence of delirium in non-ventilated ICU patients and demonstrate its clinical association with the hospital/ ICU length of stay and in-patient mortality. A total of 200 ICU patients (aged 18 years or over) who were admitted to the ICU with specific primary diagnoses were selected for the study and followed up until either hospital discharge or death. Delirium status of each patient was assessed every morning by trained study personnel using the Confusion Assessment Method for Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU). Data collection included baseline demographics, diagnosis (at the time of admission) and severity of illness using the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score. Upon evaluation of the effects associated with age, gender, mortality and other variables, it was found that age had a direct effect on the incidence of delirium, with the probability of delirium increasing with the increase in the age of patients. It was also shown that mortality, either in the ICU or during the hospital stay, was associated significantly with the occurrence of delirium. This study shows that duration of delirium in ICU is an independent predictor of long-term hospital stay and is significantly associated with mortality. These findings are crucial for health care professionals and future research trials dealing with critically ill ICU patients.
