36217699|t|Getting the guts to expand stroke treatment: The potential for microbiome targeted therapies.
36217699|a|AIMS: This review focuses on the recent literature regarding the role of the gut-brain axis (GBA) following ischemic stroke. DISCUSSION: Stroke is the 5th leading cause of death and disability in the United States; however, few therapies have been developed to improve prognoses. There is a plethora of evidence suggesting peripheral inflammatory responses play a large role in the pathogenesis of stroke. Additionally, hyperglycemic conditions may play a significant role in worsening stroke outcomes due to microbiome dysbiosis. CONCLUSION: Recent research has illuminated the vital role of the GBA in propagating poor clinical outcomes, such as hemorrhagic transformation, following ischemic stroke. Considering this detrimental consequence of stroke, and the apparent role of the GBA role, future therapeutics should aim to mitigate this peripheral contribution to stroke complications.
