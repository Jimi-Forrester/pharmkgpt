31287692|t|Role of Characteristic Components of Humulus lupulus in Promoting Human Health.
31287692|a|Over the next 50 years, the prevention and control of chronic diseases, such as obesity, cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer's disease, and many cancers, will be one of the most critical challenges in human health. Plant biochemistry and phytonutrient supplements are a promising complementary therapy for the management of chronic disease. Among them, Humulus lupulus has attracted special attention throughout the world because it contains numerous dietary phytochemicals that not only contribute to the aroma and flavor of beer but may also be used for medicinal purposes, as its properties include antiseptic, (an)aphrodisiac, anticancer, antiplatelet, antibacterial, antidiuretic, anti-inflammatory, sedative, hypnotic, and stomachic properties. This review sought to identify and understand the risk factors for chronic disease with a focus on two types of phytochemicals, bitter acids and xanthohumol. The goal was to understand how their metabolites promote human health and reduce the risk of chronic disease.
