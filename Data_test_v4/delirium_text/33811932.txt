33811932|t|beta-Amyloid peptide interactions with biomimetic membranes: A multiparametric characterization.
33811932|a|Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of senile dementia in the world, and amyloid beta peptide1-42 (Abeta1-42) is one of its two principal biological hallmarks. While interactome concept was getting forward the scientific community, we proposed that the study of the molecular interactions of amyloid beta peptide with the biological membranes will allow to highlight underlying mechanisms responsive of AD. We have developed two simple liposomal formulations (phosphatidylcholine, cholesterol, phosphatidylglycerol) mimicking neuronal cell membrane (composition, charge, curvature radius). Interactions with Abeta1-42 and mutant oG37C, a stable oligomeric form of the peptide, were characterized according to a simple multiparametric procedure based on ThT fluorescence, liposome leakage assay, ATR-FTIR spectroscopy. Kinetic aggregation, membrane damage and peptide conformation provided our first methodologic bases to develop an original model to describe interactions of Abeta peptide and lipids.
