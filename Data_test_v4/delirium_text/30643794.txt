30643794|t|Remission from Alcohol Use Disorder among Males in the Lundby Cohort during 1947-1997.
30643794|a|BACKGROUND: Alcohol use disorders are a major health problem, often with a chronic course. Studies on remission from alcohol use disorders are sparse. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to analyse the rate of remission from AUD and the possible influence of other mental disorders and sociodemographic factors on the remission in the Lundby Cohort. METHOD: Remission from AUD was studied for 312 male subjects in the Lundby Cohort, which was followed for 50 years. Cox regression analyses were used to study the possible influence of sociodemographic variables and other mental disorders on AUD remission. RESULTS: In all, 64/312 (21%) subjects achieved remission during the study period. The presence of a severe mental disorder, such as delirium tremens and organic disorders, was related to remission. Blue-collar workers had higher rates of remission than white-collar workers. There was indication that treatment improved the prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: The overall remission rate was low, but treatment may improve the prognosis. Severe mental disorders, such as delirium tremens and organic disorders as well as being blue-collar rather than white-collar worker, were related to remission.
