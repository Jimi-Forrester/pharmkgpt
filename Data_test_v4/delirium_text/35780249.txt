35780249|t|A previous hemorrhagic stroke protects against a subsequent stroke via microglia alternative polarization.
35780249|a|Microglia in hemorrhagic stroke contribute to both acute-phase exacerbation and late-phase attenuation of injury. Here, by using the mouse model, we reported that the shift in polarization of microglia from M1 to M2 phenotype could be altered by a past 'mini' stroke, resulting in better neurological function recovery, faster attenuation of lesion volume, and better survival. In mice with a previous stroke, M2 predominance appeared markedly in advance compared to mice without a previous stroke. Mechanistically, the RBC-mediated M2 polarization of microglia was synergistically enhanced by T cells: microglia cocultured with RBCs alone resulted in mild alterations to M2 markers, whereas in the presence of T cells, they expressed an early and sustained M2 response. These results suggest that by harnessing the microglia-mediated M2 polarization response, we could help mitigate devastating sequelae before a prospective hemorrhagic stroke even happens.
