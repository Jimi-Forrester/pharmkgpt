26195979|a|AIMS: We examined the 'positivity effect' on memory performance in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia patients. METHODS: In 109 subjects (28 controls, 32 with MCI, 27 with mild and 32 with moderate dementia), we investigated free recalls (immediate and delayed) and recognition of 12 pictures. Moreover, the emotional valence of the pictures perceived and the emotions evoked in the subjects were evaluated. RESULTS: Patients with mild and moderate dementia recalled fewer pictures than those with MCI or the healthy controls. Across the groups, the positive pictures were better memorized and induced a higher arousal than the negative or neutral ones. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate a positivity effect on memory performance and intensity of experience not only in healthy elderly patients but also in those with MCI or mild and moderate dementia. This effect does not refer to the compliance of the patients investigated since they perceived and experienced the pictures in the expected way.
