35425235|t|Facile synthesis of photoactivatable adenosine analogs.
35425235|a|Adenosine and its derivatives are important building blocks of the biological system. They serve as the universal energy currency, amplify intracellular signals for various signal transduction pathways, and can also be used as the co-substrates for enzymatic transformations. The synthesis and regulation of adenosine and its analogs rely on the adenosine binding proteins (ABPs). Dysregulated ABP activity contributes to numerous diseases such as cancer, metabolic disorders, and neurodegenerative diseases. Presently, there is intense interest in targeting ABPs for therapeutic purposes. A large fraction of the human ABP family remains poorly characterized. The need for innovative chemical probes to investigate ABP function in the native biological matrix is apparent. In this study, an adenosine analog, probe 1, with a photoaffinity group and biotin tag was synthesized using concise synthetic strategies. This probe was able to label and capture individual recombinant ABPs with good target selectivity. Probe 1 was also evaluated for its ability to label spiked ABP in complex cell lysates. This chemical probe, together with the labeling and enrichment assay, is of great value to interrogate the biological functions of ABPs and to elucidate their diversity under different physiological conditions.
