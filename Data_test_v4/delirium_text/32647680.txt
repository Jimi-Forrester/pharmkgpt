32647680|t|Sun's total arch replacement and stent elephant trunk with modified branch-first technique for patients with Stanford type A aortic dissection.
32647680|a|BACKGROUND: Stanford type A aortic dissection (STAAD) is a critical cardiovascular disease, and surgical procedure is the first-choice treatment. The classical surgical procedure still leads to a high mortality rate and neurological complications. In this study, we introduce a new modified Sun's procedure and investigate the association between the branch-first technique and the postoperative outcomes of patients with STAAD. METHODS: A total of 108 consecutive patients with STAAD who underwent arch replacement and stent elephant trunk procedure at Beijing Anzhen Hospital between July, 2017 and November, 2018 were included in the analysis. The patients were divided into two groups: the branch-first group and the classic group. The branch-first group and the classic group comprised 24 patients (22.2%) and 84 patients (77.8%), respectively. RESULTS: Patients in the branch-first group had a significantly shorter cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) duration (172.4+-29.9 vs. 194.9+-47.4 min; P=0.035), Intensive care unit (ICU) stay [17.0 (14.6-38.2) vs. 42.1 (19.7-87.2) hours; P<0.001], and mechanical ventilation time [15.5 (11.9-40.0) vs. 19.0 (17.0-45.6) hours; P=0.018] than patients in the classic group. The branch-first was associated with a reduction in postoperative neurological complications in all models. CONCLUSIONS: The benefits of the branch-first technique, including lower CPB duration, better bilateral cerebral perfusion, and higher nasopharyngeal temperature during hypothermic arrest, contributed to a shortened recovery time for patients after surgery.
