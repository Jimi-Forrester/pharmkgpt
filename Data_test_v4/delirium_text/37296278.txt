37296278|a|BACKGROUND: Recent research claims some interdependence between oral health and dementia; however, no empirical data could be found regarding the role of oral hygiene in delirium. This study investigated potential risk indicators related to oral hygiene in relation to development of delirium in the care of older patients. METHODS: A dental examination was performed in 120 patients in the context of a case-control study. The ratio of diseased patients with risk factors to diseased patients without risk factors describes the correlation between risk factors and the risk of disease. A binary logistic regression was performed to determine the correlation of the number of teeth to delirium. RESULTS: Every lost tooth enhances the delirium risk by 4.6%. Edentulous patients had a 2.66-fold higher risk to suffer from delirium. Caries experience and periodontitis has no significant impact on delirium prevalence. DISCUSSION: Both edentulousness and the number of lost teeth could be considered as risk indicators for delirium. Periodontitis or caries experience did not have a direct significant impact. The present study examined the merits of edentulousness and tooth loss as a screening parameter.
