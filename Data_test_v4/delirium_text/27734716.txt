27734716|a|Synaptosomal-associated protein 25 kDa (SNAP-25) is one of the key proteins involved in the formation of neural soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor complexes, which are responsible for the calcium-dependent exocytosis of neurotransmitters - a major step in neurotransmission and the key to normal functioning of brain. Several studies have reported abnormalities in its expression and structure and highlighted it as an important player in pathology of various neurological disorders like Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, attention deficient hyperactivity disorder, epilepsy and few others. Several studies have also associated its substantial expression disturbances with various polymorphisms and post-translational modifications. The present review examines the crucial implication of SNAP-25 in altered neuronal processes and highlights its substantial association with various neurological disorders.
