32611994|a|Because the brain is the most important human organ, many brain disorders can cause severe symptoms. For example, glioma, one type of brain tumor, is progressive and lethal, while neurodegenerative diseases cause severe disability. Nevertheless, medical treatment for brain diseases remains unsatisfactory, and therefore innovative therapies are desired. However, the development of therapies to treat some cerebral diseases is difficult because the blood-brain barrier (BBB) or blood-brain tumor barrier prevents drugs from entering the brain. Hence, drug delivery system (DDS) strategies are required to deliver therapeutic agents to the brain. Recently, brain-targeted DDS have been developed, which increases the quality of therapy for cerebral disorders. This review gives an overview of recent brain-targeting DDS strategies. First, it describes strategies to cross the BBB. This includes BBB-crossing ligand modification or temporal BBB permeabilization. Strategies to avoid the BBB using local administration are also summarized. Intrabrain drug distribution is a crucial factor that directly determines the therapeutic effect, and thus it is important to evaluate drug distribution using optimal methods. We introduce some methods for evaluating drug distribution in the brain. Finally, applications of brain-targeted DDS for the treatment of brain tumors, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and stroke are explained.
