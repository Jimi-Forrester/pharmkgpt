38201839|a|Ischemic stroke (IS) is a vascular disease group concomitant with high morbidity and mortality. Berberine is a bioactive substance and it has been known to improve stroke, but its mechanism is yet to be proven. Mice were fed with BBR for 14 days. Then, the mice were made into MCAO/R models. Neurological score, infarct volume, neuronal damage and markers associated with inflammation were detected. We tested the changes in intestinal flora in model mice after BBR administration using 16SrRNA sequencing. Chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to detect butyrate chemically. Tissue immunofluorescence was used to detect the changes in the microglia and astroglia in the mice brains. Our findings suggest that berberine improves stroke outcomes by modulating the gut microbiota. Specifically, after MCAO/R mice were given berberine, the beneficial bacteria producing butyric acid increased significantly, and the mice also had significantly higher levels of butyric acid. The administration of butyric acid and an inhibitor of butyric acid synthesis, heptanoyl-CoA, showed that butyric acid improved the stroke outcomes in the model mice. In addition, butyric acid could inhibit the activation of the microglia and astrocytes in the brains of model mice, thereby inhibiting the generation of pro-inflammatory factors IL-6, IL-1beta and TNF-alpha as well as improving stroke outcomes. Our results suggest that berberine may improve stroke outcomes by modulating the gut flora to increase the abundance of butyric acid. These findings elucidate the mechanisms by which berberine improves stroke outcomes and provide some basis for clinical treatment.
