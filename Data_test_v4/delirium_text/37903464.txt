37903464|a|INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to evaluate whether the addition of a hemoadsorption (HA) cartridge, HA-380, in the cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) circuit in acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) surgery reduced inflammatory cytokine levels and decreased postoperative complications. METHODS: A retrospective observational cohort study was conducted between 1 March 2021 and 28 February 2022. Patients with ATAAD undergoing emergent total arch replacement surgery were divided into the control (CON) and HA groups on the basis of the addition of the HA-380 cartridge in the CPB circuit. RESULTS: Overall, 121 patients met the eligibility criteria; 2 patients in each group who died within the first postoperative week were excluded. Further, 57 and 60 patients in the CON and HA groups, respectively, were included in the pooled analysis. The major perioperative data, baseline values of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein, and therapeutic interventions were similar in the two groups (all, P > 0.05). The serum IL-6 levels increased more rapidly in the CON group than those in the HA group postoperatively (205.73 +- 174.72 vs. 146.13 +- 64.15 pg/mL, P = 0.020). The HA group had a lower incidence of postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI) and severe acute respiratory distress syndrome than the CON group (25.4% vs. 44.6%, P = 0.032 and 18.3% vs. 35.1%, P = 0.040, respectively). Logistic regression analyses showed that HA may be a protective factor against postoperative AKI. The incidence of bleeding, delirium, and stroke as well as the lengths of intensive care unit and hospital stay in both groups were similar (all, P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The use of HA-380 in the CPB circuit may attenuate inflammatory response and reduce major complications following ATAAD surgery. HA may be associated with lower rate of postoperative AKI.
