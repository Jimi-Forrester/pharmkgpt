24574564|t|Methylphenidate and suicidal ideation: Report of two cases.
24574564|a|Stimulant prescriptions are routinely used to treat Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. Reports of psychiatric symptoms that have occurred include euphoria, delirium, confusion, toxic psychosis, and hallucinations. Here, authors report two cases of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder who were prescribed methylphenidate. Both children developed suicidal ideation that abated after discontinuing the drug. There were no depressive symptoms reported along with it, and the ideation could not be explained on the basis of impulsivity either.
