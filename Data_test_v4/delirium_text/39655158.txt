39655158|a|Objective: This study assessed how Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) and nonadherence to medication are linked, to determine whether HRQoL is a suitable endpoint for clinical trials evaluating nonadherence. Background: HRQoL is often used as an endpoint in clinical trials to determine the effectiveness of nonadherence interventions. However, the relationship between HRQoL and nonadherence is not clear, as some interventions find an effect of nonadherence on HRQoL while others do not. Since both HRQoL and nonadherence are latent constructs, it is of interest to understand the factors that link them. Methods: Medication nonadherence was assessed in 731 older adults with neurological disorders using the Stendal Adherence to Medication Score (SAMS). Regression and network analyses were performed to examine the association between the SAMS and HRQoL (SF-36). Cognitive function, depressive symptoms, mobility, and healthcare satisfaction were included as covariates. Results: There was a weak association between the SAMS and HRQoL only for the mental component scale. The relationship between the SAMS and HRQoL appears indirect, as its effect is nullified upon the inclusion of covariates, especially depressive symptoms. Network analyses showed that the effect of nonadherence on HRQoL is mainly delivered by depressive symptoms, while cognition and satisfaction with healthcare contribute to a lesser extent. Conclusion: Nonadherence and HRQoL are both latent variables influenced by similar factors. The effect of nonadherence on HRQoL seems to be indirect and mainly delivered by depressive symptoms, possibly via motivational pathways. These associations need to be considered when selecting clinical endpoints and planning interventions.
