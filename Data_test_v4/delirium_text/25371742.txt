25371742|a|The aim of the present study was to investigate the protective effect of Lactobacillus plantarum NDC 75017 on D-galactose (D-gal)-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in the rat cerebral cortex. Fifty rats were randomly divided into five groups (n=10 in each group). The rats in the aging model group were subcutaneously injected with 100 mg/kg D-gal and those in the protective groups were additionally orally administered L. plantarum NDC 75017 at doses of 1x108, 1x109 or 1x1010 CFU/100 mg body weight/day, respectively. The control rats were administrated an equal volume of the vehicle. Following continuous treatment for seven weeks, the learning and memory abilities and mitochondrial ultrastructure, function and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels were examined. The results showed that the learning and memory abilities and mitochondrial levels of ATP were significantly decreased in the D-gal-induced aging model group compared with those in the control group (P<0.01). In addition, marked changes in the mitochondrial functions and ultrastructure were observed between the groups. Seven weeks of L. plantarum NDC 75017 and D-gal coadministration significantly improved the learning and memory abilities of the rats compared with the D-gal-induced aging model group. Furthermore, the combination regime significantly improved the mitochondrial ultrastructure and functions, including the mitochondrial respiratory chain, mitochondrial membrane potential and mitochondrial permeability transition. The results revealed that the L. plantarum NDC 75017 was able to alleviate learning and memory injuries in aging rats by reducing the mitochondrial dysfunction induced by D-gal.
