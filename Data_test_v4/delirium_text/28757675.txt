28757675|t|Association of GCLM -588C/T and GCLC -129T/C Promoter Polymorphisms of Genes Coding the Subunits of Glutamate Cysteine Ligase with Ischemic Heart Disease Development in Kazakhstan Population.
28757675|a|BACKGROUND: Glutamate cysteine ligase (GCL) is a rate-limiting enzyme in synthesis of glutathione. Evidence suggests that genetic variations in the promoter region of genes coding a catalytic subunit (GCLC -129T/C) and a modifier subunit (GCLM -588C/T) of GCL have a functional impact on their transcriptional activity and were associated with various disorders. Hence, we hypothesize whether these two polymorphic variants of GCLM and GCLC genes are associated with the risk of ischemic heart disease (IHD) development in the population of Kazakhstan. METHODS: We evaluated 360 patients with IHD and 341 control subjects. Allele frequencies of studied promoters' polymorphisms were detected by PCR-RFLP analysis. Multiple logistic regression analysis was applied to assess the risk for different genotypes obtained. RESULTS: The presence of -588T allele in GCLM and -129T allele in GCLC gene genotypes was associated with an increased risk of IHD (GCLM -588T: OR = 3.92, p = 0.003; GCLC -129T: OR = 3.22, p = 0.03) for general ethnically mixed group. Analysis of each ethnical groups separately showed the higher risk tendency for Kazakhs as for GCLM -588T (OR = 4.79; p = 0.03) and as for GCLC -129T (OR = 4.79, p = 0.03). For Russians, statistically differences for two polymorphisms were not observed. CONCLUSION: The two promoter polymorphisms of GCLM (-588C/T) and GCLC (-128T/C) are associated with an increased risk of IHD in Kazakhstan population.
