36780762|t|APOE differentially moderates cerebrospinal fluid and plasma phosphorylated tau181 associations with multi-domain cognition.
36780762|a|Biofluid markers of phosphorylated tau181 (p-tau181) are increasingly popular for the detection of early Alzheimer's pathologic changes. However, the differential dynamics of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma p-tau181 remain under investigation. We studied 727 participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative with plasma and CSF p-tau181 data, apolipoprotein (APOE) epsilon4 carrier status, amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, and neuropsychological data. Higher levels of plasma and CSF p-tau181 were observed among APOE epsilon4 carriers. CSF and plasma p-tau181 were significantly associated with memory, and this effect was greater in APOE epsilon4 carriers. However, whereas CSF p-tau181 was not significantly associated with language or attention/executive function among epsilon4 carriers or non-carriers, APOE epsilon4 status moderated the association of plasma p-tau181 with both language and attention/executive function. These findings lend support to the notion that p-tau181 biofluid markers are useful in measuring AD pathologic changes but also suggest that CSF and plasma p-tau181 have unique properties and dynamics that should be considered when using these markers in research and clinical practice.
