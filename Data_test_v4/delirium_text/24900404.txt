24900404|t|Discovery of SCH 900229, a Potent Presenilin 1 Selective gamma-Secretase Inhibitor for the Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease.
24900404|a|An exploration of the SAR of the side chain of a novel tricyclic series of gamma-secretase inhibitors led to the identification of compound (-)-16 (SCH 900229), which is a potent and PS1 selective inhibitor of gamma-secretase (Abeta40 IC50 = 1.3 nM). Compound (-)-16 demonstrated excellent lowering of Abeta after oral administration in preclinical animal models and was advanced to human clinical trials for further development as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
