30893019|a|Previous studies in yeast showed that mitochondrial stressors not directly targeting the protein import machinery can cause mitochondrial precursor overaccumulation stress (mPOS) in the cytosol independent of bioenergetics. Here, we demonstrate mPOS and stress responses in human cells. We show that overloading of mitochondrial membrane carrier, but not matrix proteins, is sufficient to induce cytosolic aggresomes and apoptosis. The aggresomes appear to triage unimported mitochondrial proteins. Interestingly, expression of highly unstable mutant variants of the mitochondrial carrier protein, Ant1, also induces aggresomes despite a greater than 20-fold reduction in protein level compared to wild type. Thus, overloading of the protein import machinery, rather than protein accumulation, is critical for aggresome induction. The data suggest that the import of mitochondrial proteins is saturable and that the cytosol is limited in degrading unimported mitochondrial proteins. In addition, we found that EGR1, eEF1a, and ubiquitin C are up-regulated by Ant1 overloading. These proteins are known to promote autophagy, protein targeting to aggresomes, and the processing of protein aggregates, respectively. Finally, we found that overexpression of the misfolded variants of Ant1 induces additional cytosolic responses including proteasomal activation. In summary, our work captured a profound effect of unimported mitochondrial proteins on cytosolic proteostasis and revealed multiple anti-mPOS mechanisms in human cells.
