39077524|a|Background: To investigate the impact of Cryo Nerve Block with cryoICE  device utilization, on post-operative pain in patients undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) through left thoracotomy. Methods: All consecutive patients undergoing isolated CABG through left thoracotomy between July 2021 and July 2022 from a single surgeon were included in the study. Patients using the cryoICE  device for nerve block were compared for baseline demographics and pre-operative characteristics with those that did not use the cryoICE  device. A propensity-adjusted analysis was used to compare the two groups. The primary outcome was degree of incisional pain and numbness. Results: A total of 103 patients underwent isolated CABG through left thoracotomy. After matching, the cryoICE  device was used for nerve block in 60 patients while the control group included 43 patients. Mean follow-up was 5.7 months. The cryoICE  device group had a mean value of incisional pain at hospital discharge was 1.5 (scale 0-10) while at follow-up was 0.69 (scale 0-10). Mean values of skin numbness at hospital discharge were 1 (scale 0-10) and 0.57 (scale 0-10) at follow-up. After univariate analysis comparison of cryoICE  device group (60 patients) versus non-cryoICE  device group (43 patients), the total in-hospital morphine use was 49% lower in the cryoICE  versus the non-cryoICE  cohort (73.8 + 79.37 mg vs 144.1 + 118.99 mg). Conclusions: Good clinical outcomes were observed in patients undergoing isolated left thoracotomy CABG with cryoICE  utilization, including a very low incidence of post-operative pain, numbness, and hypersensitivity for all comers.
