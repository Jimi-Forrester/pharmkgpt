32498499|a|The treatment of delirium or psychosis in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) can be complicated by the limited number of pharmacological agents that can be used in this population. Typical and atypical antipsychotics are contraindicated, as they can worsen motor symptoms. The treatment of acute delirium is even more complicated in the hospital setting, as many medications deemed safer in this population are only available in oral form. We present a case of acute delirium in a patient with PD, likely precipitated by a polypharmacy interaction of new medications, that was successfully managed by transferring the patient to the intensive care unit and administering dexmedetomidine for 72 hours.
