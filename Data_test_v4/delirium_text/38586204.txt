38586204|a|Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN) is an extremely rare and aggressive tumor with an unknown pathogenesis. Myelofibrosis (MF) is a type of myeloproliferative neoplasm. MF can be secondary to several hematological malignancies, including chronic myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome and hairy cell leukemia. In the present report, a rare case of BPDCN secondary to MF is described. A 70-year-old male patient developed a large purplish-red rash with recurrent symptoms. BPDCN was confirmed by immunohistochemistry of a biopsy specimen and flow cytometry of bone marrow cells. Bone marrow histopathology revealed MF. Next-generation sequencing of peripheral blood revealed mutations in the Tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 2 and NRAS proto-oncogene GTPase genes. The patient underwent one cycle of chemoimmunotherapy, but the condition progressed, an infection developed and the patient eventually died. The present case suggests that BPDCN can occur in conjunction with MF and that the prognosis of such patients is poor. Pathological examination and genetic testing aided in the diagnosis and treatment. This case emphasizes the need to raise awareness of BPDCN among clinicians and to be alert to the potential for fatal infection in patients with BPDCN combined with MF following myelosuppression triggered during chemotherapy.
