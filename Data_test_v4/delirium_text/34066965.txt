34066965|t|Sleep Well and Recover Faster with Less Pain-A Narrative Review on Sleep in the Perioperative Period.
34066965|a|Sleep disturbance, pain, and having a surgical procedure of some kind are all very likely to occur during the average lifespan. Postoperative pain continues to be a prevalent problem and growing evidence supports the association between pain and sleep disturbances. The bidirectional nature of sleep and pain is widely acknowledged. A decline in sleep quality adds a risk for the onset of pain and also exacerbates existing pain. The risk factors for developing insomnia and experiencing severe pain after surgery are quite similar. The main aim of this narrative review is to discuss why it is important to be aware of sleep disturbances both before and after surgery, to know how sleep disturbances should be assessed and monitored, and to understand how better sleep can be supported by both pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions.
