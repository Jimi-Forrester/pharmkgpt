16136845|a|This manuscript analyzes the use of the Greater Cincinnati Chapter Well-Being Observation Tool in observing seven domains of well-being among individuals with dementia. We observed the well-being of 12 individuals while they engaged in Memories in the Making, an art program for persons in the early and middle stages of the disease that encourages self-expression through the visual arts. This was then compared to the observed well-being in the same individuals during participation in more traditional adult day center activities, such as current events and crafts. Results indicated that the individuals demonstrated significantly more interest, sustained attention, pleasure, self-esteem, and normalcy during participation in Memories in the Making, additionally, there were no differences in negative affect or sadness between the two types of activities. Directions for future research are also discussed.
