33965012|t|Dual-channel fluorescent signal readout strategy for cysteine sensing.
33965012|a|Cysteine (Cys) is a biological thiol. Aberrant changes in thiol levels are associated with the development and pathogenesis of various diseases, including liver damage, Alzheimer's disease, weakness, and cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, thiol detection in biological samples has great importance in health monitoring and disease prediction. In this study, we developed a ratiometric fluorescence nanosensor combined with carbon dots (CDs)-doped mesoporous silica and fluorescein-based fluorescent probes loaded in pores for Cys detection. The nanosensor emitted fluorescence at 450 nm upon excitation at 370 nm. In the presence of Cys, the fluorescence emission from the probe could be selectively enhanced, whereas that from CDs could be changed. Thus, a ratiometric fluorescent sensor was developed. This sensor can eliminate the potential influence of background fluorescence and other analyte-independent external environmental factors. The nanosensor was utilized to monitor Cys levels in human serum, and satisfactory results were obtained. Results indicated that the nanosensor can be utilized as an excellent fluorescent nanocomposite material in practical biological applications.
