29681782|t|Early Detection of Abeta Deposition in the 5xFAD Mouse by Amyloid PET.
29681782|a|Purpose.18F-FC119S is a positron emission tomography (PET) tracer for imaging beta-amyloid (Abeta) plaques in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of 18F-FC119S in quantitating Abeta deposition in a mouse model of early amyloid deposition (5xFAD) by PET. Method. Dynamic 18F-FC119S PET images were obtained in 5xFAD (n = 5) and wild-type (WT) mice (n = 7). The brain PET images were spatially normalized to the M. Mirrione T2-weighted mouse brain MR template, and the volumes of interest were then automatically drawn on the cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, and cerebellum. The specific binding of 18F-FC119S to Abeta was quantified as the distribution volume ratio using Logan graphical analysis with the cerebellum as a reference tissue. The Abeta levels in the brain were also confirmed by immunohistochemical analysis. Result. For the 5xFAD group, radioactivity levels in the cortex, the hippocampus, and the thalamus were higher than those for the WT group. In these regions, specific binding was approximately 1.2-fold higher in 5xFAD mice than in WT. Immunohistochemistry supported these findings; the 5xFAD showed severe Abeta deposition in the cortex and hippocampus in contrast to the WT group. Conclusion. These results demonstrated that 18F-FC119S PET can successfully distinguish Abeta depositions in 5xFAD mice from WT.
