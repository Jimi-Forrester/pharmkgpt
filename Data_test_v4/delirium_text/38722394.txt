38722394|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease is a leading neurological disorder that gradually impairs memory and cognitive abilities, ultimately leading to the inability to perform even basic daily tasks. Teriflunomide is known to preserve neuronal activity and protect mitochondria in the brain slices exposed to oxidative stress. The current research was undertaken to investigate the teriflunomide's cognitive rescuing abilities against scopolamine-induced comorbid cognitive impairment and its influence on phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) inhibition-mediated behavior alteration in mice. METHODS: Swiss albino mice were divided into 7 groups; vehicle control, scopolamine, donepezil + scopolamine, teriflunomide (10 mg/kg) + scopolamine; teriflunomide (20 mg/kg) + scopolamine, LY294002 and LY294002 + teriflunomide (20 mg/kg). Mice underwent a nine-day protocol, receiving scopolamine injections (2 mg/kg) for the final three days to induce cognitive impairment. Donepezil, teriflunomide, and LY294002 treatments were given continuously for 9 days. MWM, Y-maze, OFT and rota-rod tests were conducted on days 7 and 9. On the last day, blood samples were collected for serum TNF-alpha analysis, after which the mice were sacrificed, and brain samples were harvested for oxidative stress analysis. RESULTS: Scopolamine administration for three consecutive days increased the time required to reach the platform in the MWM test, whereas, reduced the percentage of spontaneous alternations in the Y-maze, number of square crossing in OFT and retention time in the rota-rod test. In biochemical analysis, scopolamine downregulated the brain GSH level, whereas it upregulated the brain TBARS and serum TNF-alpha levels. Teriflunomide treatment effectively mitigated all the behavioral and biochemical alterations induced by scopolamine. Furthermore, LY294002 administration reduced the memory function and GSH level, whereas, uplifted the serum TNF-alpha levels. Teriflunomide abrogated the memory-impairing, GSH-lowering, and TNF-alpha-increasing effects of LY294002. CONCLUSION: Our results delineate that the improvement in memory, locomotion, and motor coordination might be attributed to the oxidative and inflammatory stress inhibitory potential of teriflunomide. Moreover, PI3K inhibition-induced memory impairment might be attributed to reduced GSH levels and increased TNF-alpha levels.
