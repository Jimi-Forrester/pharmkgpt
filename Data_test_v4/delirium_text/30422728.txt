30422728|a|Diabetes mellitus (DM) is one of the most common metabolic disorders characterized by hyperglycemia due to insufficiency of insulin and/or insulin resistance. Clinical studies have revealed a higher risk of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's disease in diabetic patients. Recently, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is an attractive potential treatment modality for various neurodegenerative diseases. In our study, we aimed to investigate whether exenatide, a GLP-1 analogue, has neuroprotective effects against glucose and fructose-induced toxicity in human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line. Neurotoxicity was induced by incubating SH-SY5Y cells with different doses (25-100 mM) of glucose and fructose for 24, 48 and 72 hours. Following determination of the significant toxic doses of glucose and fructose, the cells were treated with various doses of exenatide (10-250 nM) in the presence or absence of glucose and fructose. Neurotoxicity was evaluated by MTT assay and Hoechst 33258 staining. Caspase-3 activity and the levels of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) were determined in the cytosolic fractions of treated cells. Our results demonstrated that both glucose and fructose treatments decreased cell viability in neuronal cells dose and time-dependently. Glucose and fructose-treated groups showed increased numbers of apoptotic cells, caspase-3 activity and AGEs levels. Treatment of the cells with exenatide significantly prevented cell death. The most prominent effect was observed at 100 nM exenatide-treated cultures. Our results suggest that high doses of glucose and fructose may lead to neurotoxicity, and exenatide may have protective effects against neuronal damage through its anti-apoptotic feature.
