33515429|a|Neurological diseases share common neuroinflammatory and oxidative stress pathways. Both phenotypic and molecular changes in microglia, astrocytes, and neurons contribute to the progression of disease and present potential targets for disease modification. Src family kinases (SFKs) are present in both neurons and glial cells and are upregulated following neurological insults in both human and animal models. In neurons, SFKs interact with post-synaptic protein domains to mediate hyperexcitability and neurotoxicity. SFKs are upstream of signaling cascades that lead to the modulation of neurotransmitter receptors and the transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines as well as producers of free radicals through the activation of glia. Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS/NOS-II) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase 2 (NOX2), the major mediators of reactive nitrogen/oxygen species (RNS/ROS) production in the brain, are also upregulated along with the pro-inflammatory cytokines following neurological insult and contribute to disease progression. Persistent neuronal hyperexcitability, RNS/ROS, and cytokines can exacerbate neurodegeneration, a common pathognomonic feature of the most prevalent neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and epilepsy. Using a wide variety of preclinical disease models, inhibitors of the SFK-iNOS-NOX2 signaling axis have been tested to cure or modify disease progression. In this review, we discuss the SFK-iNOS-NOX2 signaling pathway and their inhibitors as potential CNS targets for major neurological diseases.
