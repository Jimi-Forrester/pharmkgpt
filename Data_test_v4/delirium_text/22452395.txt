22452395|a|Abnormal interactions of Cu and Zn ions with the amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide are proposed to play an important role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Disruption of these metal-peptide interactions using chemical agents holds considerable promise as a therapeutic strategy to combat this incurable disease. Reported herein are two bifunctional compounds (BFCs) L1 and L2 that contain both amyloid-binding and metal-chelating molecular motifs. Both L1 and L2 exhibit high stability constants for Cu(2+) and Zn(2+) and thus are good chelators for these metal ions. In addition, L1 and L2 show strong affinity toward Abeta species. Both compounds are efficient inhibitors of the metal-mediated aggregation of the Abeta(42) peptide and promote disaggregation of amyloid fibrils, as observed by ThT fluorescence, native gel electrophoresis/Western blotting, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Interestingly, the formation of soluble Abeta(42) oligomers in the presence of metal ions and BFCs leads to an increased cellular toxicity. These results suggest that for the Abeta(42) peptide-in contrast to the Abeta(40) peptide-the previously employed strategy of inhibiting Abeta aggregation and promoting amyloid fibril dissagregation may not be optimal for the development of potential AD therapeutics, due to formation of neurotoxic soluble Abeta(42) oligomers.
