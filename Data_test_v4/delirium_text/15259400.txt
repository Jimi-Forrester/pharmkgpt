15259400|t|Evaluation of prospective memory training for individuals with mild Alzheimer's disease.
15259400|a|Prospective memory (PM) refers to the timely execution of a previously formed intention. PM deficits are one of the earliest measurable deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD; Huppert & Beardsall, 1993) and yet, there has been little systematic research devoted to identifying ways in which these deficits can be compensated for or minimized. In this pilot study, individuals with mild AD participated in a new training program aimed at improving PM performance on an experimental PM task. PM training consisted of errorless learning and spaced retrieval techniques taught in six sessions in subjects' homes. Results showed that compared to untrained AD controls. AD patients who received PM training performed a PM task successfully across 7 weeks posttreatment (over 90% accuracy; controls 16-33% accuracy).
