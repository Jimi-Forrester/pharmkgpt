36988434|t|Altered large-scale dynamic connectivity patterns in Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment patients: A machine learning study.
36988434|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegeneration disease associated with substantial disruptions in the brain network. However, most studies investigated static resting-state functional connections, while the alteration of dynamic functional connectivity in AD remains largely unknown. This study used group independent component analysis and the sliding-window method to estimate the subject-specific dynamic connectivity states in 1704 individuals from three data sets. Informative inherent states were identified by the multivariate pattern classification method, and classifiers were built to distinguish ADs from normal controls (NCs) and to classify mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients with informative inherent states similar to ADs or not. In addition, MCI subgroups with heterogeneous functional states were examined in the context of different cognition decline trajectories. Five informative states were identified by feature selection, mainly involving functional connectivity belonging to the default mode network and working memory network. The classifiers discriminating AD and NC achieved the mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.87 with leave-one-site-out cross-validation. Alterations in connectivity strength, fluctuation, and inter-synchronization were found in AD and MCIs. Moreover, individuals with MCI were clustered into two subgroups, which had different degrees of atrophy and different trajectories of cognition decline progression. The present study uncovered the alteration of dynamic functional connectivity in AD and highlighted that the dynamic states could be powerful features to discriminate patients from NCs. Furthermore, it demonstrated that these states help to identify MCIs with faster cognition decline and might contribute to the early prevention of AD.
