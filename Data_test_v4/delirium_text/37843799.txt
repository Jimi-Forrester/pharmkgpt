37843799|t|Human Cerebrospinal Fluid Sample Preparation and Annotation for Integrated Lipidomics and Metabolomics Profiling Studies.
37843799|a|Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a metabolically diverse biofluid and a key specimen for exploring biochemical changes in neurodegenerative diseases. Detecting lipid species in CSF using mass spectrometry (MS)-based techniques remains challenging because lipids are highly complex in structure, and their concentrations span over a broad dynamic range. This work aimed to develop a robust lipidomics and metabolomics method based on commonly used two-phase extraction systems from human CSF samples. Prioritizing lipid detection, biphasic extraction methods, Folch, Bligh and Dyer (B&D), Matyash, and acidified Folch and B&D (aFolch and aB&D) were compared using 150 muL of human CSF samples for the simultaneous extraction of lipids and metabolites with a wide range of polarity. Multiple chromatographical separation approaches, including reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC), hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC), and gas chromatography (GC), were utilized to characterize human CSF metabolome. The aB&D method was found as the most reproducible technique (RSD < 15%) for lipid extraction. The aB&D and B&D yielded the highest peak intensities for targeted lipid internal standards and displayed superior extracting power for major endogenous lipid classes. A total of 674 unique metabolites with a wide polarity range were annotated in CSF using, combining RPLC-MS/MS lipidomics (n = 219), HILIC-MS/MS (n = 304), and GC-quadrupole time of flight (QTOF) MS (n = 151). Overall, our findings show that the aB&D extraction method provided suitable lipid coverage, reproducibility, and extraction efficiency for global lipidomics profiling of human CSF samples. In combination with RPLC-MS/MS lipidomics, complementary screening approaches enabled a comprehensive metabolite signature that can be employed in an array of clinical studies.
