8410053|a|A patient with the clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease is presented in whom pre-mortem T2-weighted MRI revealed a periventricular white matter lesion. Postmortem T2 weighted MRIs of the formalin fixed brain revealed the same white matter lesion. Microscopically, classical Alzheimer changes were found and, unsuspectedly, the histopathological correlate of the white matter lesion proved to be an old, inactive, MS plaque. A similar lesion was discovered in the cervical myelum. These findings illustrate that T2-weighted post-mortem MRIs are highly comparable to pre-mortem images and that MRI is sensitive in detecting clinically silent white matter lesions. The histopathology of such lesions may also include MS plaques.
