32843045|a|BACKGROUND: With the use of tranexamic acid and control of the blood pressure during the operation, total knee arthroplasty (TKA) without tourniquet can be achieved. There is no exact standard for the control level of blood pressure during no tourniquet TKA. We explored the optimal level of blood pressure control during no tourniquet TKA surgery with the use of tranexamic acid in this study. METHODS: Patients underwent TKA were divided into three groups: the mean intraoperative systolic blood pressure in group A was < 90 mmHg, 90-100 mmHg in group B, > 100 mmHg in group C. Total blood loss (TBL), intraoperative blood loss, hidden blood loss, transfusion rate, maximum hemoglobin drop, operation time, and postoperative hospitalization days were recorded. RESULTS: Two hundred seventy-eight patients were enrolled, 82 in group A, 105 in group B, and 91 in group C. Group A (663.3 +- 46.0 ml) and group B (679.9 +- 57.1 ml) had significantly lower TBL than group C (751.7 +- 56.2 ml). Group A (120.2 +- 18.7 ml) had the lowest intraoperative blood loss than groups B and C. Group C (26.0 +- 4.1 g/l) had the largest Hb change than groups A and B. Group A (62.3 +- 4.7 min) had the shortest operation time. The incidence rate of postoperative hypotension in group A (8, 9.8%) was significantly greater than groups B and C. No significant differences were found in other outcomes. CONCLUSION: The systolic blood pressure from 90 to 100 mmHg was the optimal strategy for no tourniquet primary TKA with tranexamic acid.
