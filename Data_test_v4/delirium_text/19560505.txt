19560505|a|To address the potential impact of presenilin mutations on the prostaglandin metabolism in a neurodegenerative model of glutamatergic excitotoxicity, we injected kainic acid intraperitoneally (30mg/kg body weight) into mice over-expressing the human N141I mutation of presenilin-2, which is known to cause an early-onset form of Alzheimer's disease. We compared the seizure activity as well as seizure lethality in 2- and 6-month-old mice, transgenic for the above-mentioned point mutation, and their wildtype littermates and found that mice harboring the hN141I mutation showed a relative resistance to excitotoxic treatment. This was associated with a constituitively reduced expression of the cyclooxygenases COX-1 and COX-2 in the hippocampus of N141I presenilin-2 mice and a reduced induction of COX-2 expression post-kainate injection. In the past, clinical trials have suggested that both non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which impact upon a cell's prostaglandin metabolism, and glutamatergic antagonists might be of benefit to patients suffering from Alzheimer's-type dementias. Yet, the exact mechanism by which these drugs are beneficial remains unclear, although it seems possible that presenilins might be implicated in the process, at least in the case of early-onset forms. The data presented here strongly support the notion of an implication of presenilins in the alterations in the prostaglandin system, which have been observed in Alzheimer's disease and may contribute to the underlying pathogenesis of the disease.
