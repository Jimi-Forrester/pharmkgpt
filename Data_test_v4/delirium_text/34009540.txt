34009540|t|Impairment of Cognitive Function in Different Domains Early After Lung Transplantation.
34009540|a|In this prospective observational pilot study patients with the diagnosis of end-stage lung disease and listed for lung transplantation underwent a cognitive function test battery before and after lung transplantation to investigate postoperative cognitive function in three domains (visual and verbal memory, executive functioning, concentration/speed of processing). Additionally we investigated intraoperative risk factors for postoperative cognitive dysfunction. In total, 24 patients were included in this pilot study. The incidence of postoperative cognitive dysfunction was 58.3%. In the cognitive dysfunction group, the domains executive functioning and concentration/attention were significantly impaired whereas memory was not affected. Patients with cognitive impairment had a significantly longer ICU stay. The strongest independent risk factor for the development of cognitive dysfunction was operation time. No influence of cerebral oxygen desaturations on cognitive dysfunction was found. This might have important implications for early psychological rehabilitation strategies in this high-risk patient collective.
