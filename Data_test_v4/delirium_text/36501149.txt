36501149|a|The underlying mechanism in both cognitive impairment and depression was chronic inflammation, which could be reflected by the dietary inflammatory index (DII). However, the effect of cognitive impairment on the association between DII and depression was not clear. Therefore, in this study, we hypothesized that cognitive impairment could mediate the association between dietary inflammation and depressive symptoms. A total of 2550 participants aged >=60 from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) in 2011-2014 were involved in the serial, cross-sectional study. Proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory diets were measured by DII. Cognitive impairment was measured by four dimensions, CERAD-immediate, CERAN-delayed, animal fluency test, and DSST. Depressive symptoms were measured by PHQ-9 scores. We found that a proinflammatory diet and cognitive impairment were both risk factors for depressive symptoms. An interaction between an inflammatory diet and cognitive impairment was detected (P-interaction = 0.060). In addition, all four dimensions of cognition mediated the association between DII and depressive symptom scores. Part of the association between DII and depressive symptoms scores could be explained by different dimensions of cognitive function, and the proportion of mediation ranged from 10.0% to 36.7%. In conclusion, cognitive impairment levels partly mediated the association between DII and depressive symptoms.
