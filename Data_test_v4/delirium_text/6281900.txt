6281900|t|[A clinical trial of tiapride in neurology (author's transl)].
6281900|a|Results in twenty-three patients given tiapride are reported on. As an analgesic, tiapride's efficacy was questionable. In patients with delirium, sedation was not completely satisfactory; however, this may be due to the small number of patients and to the low doses given. The excellent results recorded in patients given tiapride for extrapyramidal hyperkinesia due to various etiologies are consistent with previous reports in the medical literature.
