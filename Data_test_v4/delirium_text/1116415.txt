1116415|t|Scleroderma cerebritis, an unusual manifestation of progressive systemic sclerosis.
1116415|a|A 42-year-old female with scleroderma experienced two exacerbations in which behavioral changes were the main clinical features. On both occasions she presented with paranoid delusions, perceptual aberrations, and disorientation. After treatment with corticosteroids, the patient's mental status returned to normal, and her electroencephalogram showed an increase in alpha wave frequency, which is consistent with a resolving delirium. Unlike systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma rarely involves the central nervous system. This case illustrates an unusual manifestation of progressive systemic sclerosis, primary cerebral involvement which presented as an acute organic brain syndrome. Connective tissue diseases, notably systemic lupus erythematosus, often present neuropsychiatric symptoms. Despite the fact that there appears to be a clinical and pathological continuum among the connective tissue diseases, an organic psychosis rarely occurs in progressive systemic sclerosis (scleroderma. Described here is a patient with scleroderma in whom behavioral abnormalities were the main features of two exacerbations of the disease.
