36208546|t|Metabolic connectivity is associated with seizure outcome in surgically treated temporal lobe epilepsies: A 18F-FDG PET seed correlation analysis.
36208546|a|18F-FDG PET provides high sensitivity for the pre-surgical assessment of drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). However, little is known about the metabolic connectivity of epileptogenic networks involved. This study therefore aimed to evaluate the association between metabolic connectivity and seizure outcome in surgically treated TLE. METHODS: The study included 107 right-handed patients that had undergone a presurgical interictal 18F-FDG PET assessment followed by an anterior temporal lobectomy and were classified according to seizure outcome 2 years after surgery. Metabolic connectivity was evaluated by seed correlation analysis in left and right epilepsy patients with a Class Engel IA or > IA outcome and compared to age-, sex- and handedness-matched healthy controls. RESULTS: Increased metabolic connectivity was observed in the >IA compared to the IA group within the operated temporal lobe (respective clusters of 7.5 vs 3.3 cm3 and 2.6 cm3 vs 2.2 cm3 in left and right TLE), and to a lower extent with the contralateral temporal lobe (1.2 vs 0.7 cm3 and 1.7 cm3 vs 0.7 cm3 in left and right TLE). Seed correlations provided added value for the estimated individual performance of seizure outcome over the group comparisons in left TLE (AUC of 0.74 vs 0.67). CONCLUSION: Metabolic connectivity is associated with outcome in surgically treated TLE with a strengthened epileptogenic connectome in patients with non-free-seizure outcomes. The added value of seed correlation analysis in left TLE underlines the importance of evaluating metabolic connectivity in network related diseases.
