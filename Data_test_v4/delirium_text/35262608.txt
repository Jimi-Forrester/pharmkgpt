METHODS: A quantitative, cross-sectional exploratory study, which analyzed data from the sociodemographic profile, Confusion Assessment Method, Charlson Comorbidities Index, and follow-up of the outcomes "in-hospital death" and "length of hospitalization." The period analyzed in the study was between July and December 2019. RESULTS: Of the 732 participants, 394 (53.90%) were men, with an average age of 72 years. The study identified Delirium in 99 (13.52%) participants, and death, in 120 (16.39%). There was an association of this disorder with age, comorbidities, length of hospitalization, death, and some reasons for hospitalization, such as diseases of the circulatory, respiratory and genitourinary systems. CONCLUSION: The results warn of the high incidence of delirium in emergency units and their relationship with a worse prognosis.
