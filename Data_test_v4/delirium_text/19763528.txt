19763528|a|BACKGROUND: The following study presents in detail newly occurring changes in driving ability of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia due to frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). PATIENTS AND METHODS: The caregivers of 30 patients with FTLD (20 with FTD, 10 with SD) and 26 matched patients with AD were interviewed on potential alterations in driving ability using a standardized questionnaire. RESULTS: Of the patients 90% with FTLD and 58% with AD showed changes in driving behavior. In AD the predominating alteration was an unsteady style of driving with increased lack of orientation. Patients with FTLD presented an aggressive and risky style of driving including various traffic rule violations. Significant differences between the two groups were observed regarding speeding, disregarding red traffic lights, inappropriate behavior and driving despite being forbidden by the family Of the patients with FTLD 37% were responsible for at least one accident since disease onset in comparison to 19% of patients with AD (p=0.24). Most patients with AD showed a reasonable attitude to their change in driving behavior, however the majority of patients with FTLD showed a lack of understanding for the fact that their style of driving presented a potential risk and did not accept the need to stop driving (p=0.023). CONCLUSION: Patients with FTLD should cease driving as soon as possible in the course of the disease. With patients suffering from mild AD an individual assessment should be made.
