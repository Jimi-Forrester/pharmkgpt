36703272|a|OBJECTIVE: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that can reduce quality of life (QOL). Previous research has explored patient specific factors that influence QOL; but understanding external factors that may also affect patient QOL, such as caregiver characteristics, can provide additional intervention targets that may improve QOL for both the person with PD and their caregiver. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of existing literature on caregiver factors that are related to QOL for the person with PD. We developed a tailored search strategy in six databases and performed a screening procedure according to PRISMA guidelines. We synthesized findings from articles that met inclusion criteria using a narrative approach and identified themes categorizing caregiver factors associated with PD QOL. RESULTS: We found 32 full-text articles that fulfilled the inclusion criteria and passed the quality appraisal. Seven themes were identified, including: (1) burden, (2) strain, (3) QOL and satisfaction, (4) demographic factors, (5) psychological factors, (6) relationship factors, and (7) caregiver input. CONCLUSIONS: Our review presents critical insights into the role of the caregiver in the QOL of a person with PD. Findings reveal several targets for intervention to improve QOL in this population.
