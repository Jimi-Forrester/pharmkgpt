12366820|t|The role of cytochrome c oxidase deficient hippocampal neurones in Alzheimer's disease.
12366820|a|Defects of mitochondrial function have been proposed as a potential mechanism in the development and pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and neuronal apoptosis. Mitochondrial enzyme-deficient pyramidal neurones are found in greater quantities in the hippocampus of AD patients than in age-matched controls. The presence of these neurones indicates that high levels of mutant mtDNA (mitochondrial DNA), sufficient to cause a biochemical deficiency within individual neurones, occur more frequently in AD than in normal ageing. This study analyses the relationship of cytochrome c oxidase (COX)-deficient neurones with the neuropathological markers of AD, neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and amyloid plaques, as well as markers of neuronal apoptosis known to occur in AD brains. Frozen sections of hippocampi from three AD patients were used to directly colocalize in situ the presence of histochemically COX-deficient neurones with immunohistology for the classical neuropathological markers of AD, tau and beta-amyloid. In addition, we also directly colocalized these mitochondrial-enzyme deficient neurones using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labelling and cleaved caspase-3. The distribution of amyloid plaques is anatomically distinct from the COX-deficient hippocampal pyramidal neurones and the neurones that contained NFTs or apoptotic labelling were always COX-positive. COX-deficient, succinate dehydrogenase-positive hippocampal neurones indicative of high mtDNA mutation load do not appear to be prone to apoptosis or to directly participate in the over production of tau or beta-amyloid. Biochemically significant mitochondrial defects do occur in AD and are likely to contribute to the overall central nervous system dysfunction in impairing neuronal function and possibly causing neurodegeneration via mechanisms other than apoptosis.
