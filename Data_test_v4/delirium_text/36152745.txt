36152745|t|Protective effect of miR-34c antagomir against STZ-induced memory impairment by targeting mTOR and PSD-95 in the hippocampus of rats.
36152745|a|After long times of ongoing research, still there is no appropriate cure for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recently, epigenetic alterations, particularly miRNA, have gotten attention in AD research. Among various miRNA, miR-34c has been addressed to be elevated in the brain of AD patients, however, its exact role and downstream mechanisms have not been elucidated yet. This study aimed to investigate the therapeutic potential of miR-34c antagomir on cognitive dysfunction induced by streptozocin (STZ), considering postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95) and mammalian target of rapamycin expression (mTOR). Forty rats were cannulated intraventricularly under deep anesthesia using stereotaxic apparatus and divided into five groups: saline + saline, STZ + saline, STZ + miR-34c antagomir, STZ + lipofectamine, and STZ + scrambled, and received the related treatments for two weeks. At the end of the treatments, spatial memory and locomotor activity were assessed by Morris water maze (MWM), and open fields, respectively. Finally, PSD-95 and mTOR levels were measured by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) and western blotting on hippocampal samples. Results showed that miR-34c antagomir markedly ameliorated spatial learning and memory deficits induced by STZ, and significantly enhanced PSD-95 and mTOR levels in the hippocampus. In conclusion, miR-34c antagomir may be considered as a promising novel therapeutic target for AD patients.
