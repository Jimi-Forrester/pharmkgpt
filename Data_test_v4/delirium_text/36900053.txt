36900053|t|Asymptomatic Aortic Stenosis in an Older Patient: How the Geriatric Approach Can Make a Difference.
36900053|a|We present a case report of an older patient with aortic stenosis who was managed before and after transcatheter aortic valve implantation by a team of cardiologists but without the support of a geriatrician. We first describe the patient's post-interventional complications from a geriatric perspective and afterwards, discuss the unique approach that the geriatrician would have provided. This case report was written by a group of geriatricians working in an acute hospital, along with a clinical cardiologist who is an expert in aortic stenosis. We discuss the implications for modifying conventional practice in tandem with existing literature.
