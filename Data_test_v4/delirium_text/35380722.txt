35380722|t|Methadone as First-line Opioid for the Management of Cancer Pain.
35380722|a|AIM: The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and adverse effects of methadone when used as first-line therapy in patients that are either receiving low doses of opioids or none. METHODS: Patients with advanced cancer were prospectively assessed. Opioid-naive patients (L-group) were started with methadone at 6 mg/day. Patients receiving weak or other opioids in doses of <60 mg/day of OME (H-group) were started with methadone at 9 mg/day. Methadone doses were changed according to the clinical needs to obtain the most favorable balance between analgesia and adverse effects. Edmonton Symptom Asssement Score (ESAS), Memorial Delirium Assessment Score (MDAS), doses of methadone, and the use of adjuvant drugs were recorded before starting the study treatment (T0), 1 week after (T7), 2 weeks after (T14), 1 month after (T30), and 2 months after (T60). Methadone escalation index percent (MEI%) and in mg (MEImg) were calculated at T30 and T60. RESULTS: Eighty-two patients were assessed. In both groups H and L, there were significant changes in pain and symptom intensity at the different times during the study. Adverse effects as causes of drop-out were minimal. Mean MEImg was 0.09 (SD 0.28) and 0.02 (SD 0.07) at T30 and T60, respectively. MEI% was 1.01 (SD 3.08) and 0.27 (SD 0.86) at T30 and T60, respectively. CONCLUSION: Methadone used as a first-line opioid therapy provided good analgesia with limited adverse effects and a minimal opioid-induced tolerance.
