36712094|t|Apo- and holo- transferrin differentially interact with ferroportin and hephaestin to regulate iron release at the blood-brain barrier.
36712094|a|Background: Apo- (iron free) and holo- (iron bound) transferrin (Tf) participate in precise regulation of brain iron uptake at endothelial cells of the blood-brain barrier. Apo-Tf indicates an iron deficient environment and stimulates iron release, while holo-Tf indicates an iron sufficient environment and suppresses additional iron release. Free iron is exported through ferroportin, with hephaestin as an aid to the process. Until now, the molecular mechanism of apo- and holo-Tf's influence on iron release was largely unknown. Methods: Here we use a variety of cell culture techniques, including co-immunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assay, in iPSC-derived endothelial cells and HEK 293 cells to investigate the mechanism of apo- and holo-Tf's influence over iron release. We placed our findings in physiological context by further deciphering how hepcidin played a role in this mechanism as well. Results: We demonstrate that holo-Tf induces the internalization of ferroportin through the established ferroportin degradation pathway. Furthermore, holo-Tf directly binds to ferroportin, whereas apo-Tf directly binds to hephaestin. Only pathological levels of hepcidin disrupt the interaction between holo-Tf and ferroportin, and no amount of hepcidin disrupts the interaction between apo-Tf and hephaestin. The disruption of the holo-Tf and ferroportin interaction by hepcidin is due to hepcidin's ability to rapidly internalize ferroportin compared to holo-Tf. Conclusions: These novel findings provide a molecular mechanism for apo- and holo-Tf regulation of iron release from endothelial cells. They further demonstrate how hepcidin impacts these protein-protein interactions, and offer a model for how holo-Tf and hepcidin corporate to suppress iron release. We have established a more thorough understanding of the mechanisms behind iron release regulation with great clinical impact for a variety of neurological conditions in which iron release is dysregulated.
