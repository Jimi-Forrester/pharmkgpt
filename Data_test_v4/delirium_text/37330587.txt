37330587|a|The use of terpenoid compounds in different neural-related conditions is becoming useful for several illnesses. Another possible activity of these compounds is the reduction of nervous impairment. Cannabis sativa plants are known for their concentration of two important terpenoids, the delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD). CBD and THC have central peripheral activities already described and their usage in different brain diseases, such as Alzheimer's and multiple sclerosis. Aluminum (Al) is known as an important neurotoxic compound, the physiological action of Al is not known already, and in high concentrations can lead to intoxication and cause neurotoxicity. Here we evaluated the potential effect of two different doses of CBD- and THC-rich based oils against Al-induced toxicity, in the zebrafish model. We evaluated behavioral biomarkers of the novel tank test (NTT) and social preference test (SPT), and biochemical markers: the activity of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and the antioxidant enzymes-catalase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione-S-transferase. CBD- and THC-based oils were able to increase the AChE activity helping the cholinergic nervous system actuate against Al toxicity which was reflected by the behavioral biomarkers changes. We concluded that the oils have a protective effect and might be used with proposals for neurological and antioxidant impairment avoidance caused by Al intoxications.
