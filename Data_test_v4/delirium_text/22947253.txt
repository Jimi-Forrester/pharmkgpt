22947253|a|BACKGROUND: Microglia are the resident immune cells of the central nervous system and are accepted to be involved in a variety of neurodegenerative diseases. Several studies have demonstrated that microglia, like peripheral macrophages, exhibit two entirely different functional activation states, referred to as classical (M1) and alternative (M2) activation. TGFbeta is one of the most important anti-inflammatory cytokines and its effect on inhibiting microglia or macrophage classical activation has been extensively studied. However, the role of TGFbeta during alternative activation of microglia has not been described yet. METHODS: To investigate the role of TGFbeta in IL4-induced microglia alternative activation, both, BV2 as well as primary microglia from new born C57BL/6 mice were used. Quantitative RT-PCR and western blots were performed to detect mRNA and protein levels of the alternative activation markers Arginase1 (Arg1) and Chitinase 3-like 3 (Ym1) after treatment with IL4, TGFbeta or both. Endogenous TGFbeta release after IL4 treatment was evaluated using the mink lung epithelial cell (MLEC) assay and a direct TGFbeta2 ELISA. TGFbeta receptor type I inhibitor and MAPK inhibitor were applied to address the involvement of TGFbeta signalling and MAPK signalling in IL4-induced alternative activation of microglia. RESULTS: TGFbeta enhances IL4-induced microglia alternative activation by strongly increasing the expression of Arg1 and Ym1. This synergistic effect on Arg1 induction is almost completely blocked by the application of the MAPK inhibitor, PD98059. Further, treatment of primary microglia with IL4 increased the expression and secretion of TGFbeta2, suggesting an involvement of endogenous TGFbeta in IL4-mediated microglia activation process. Moreover, IL4-mediated induction of Arg1 and Ym1 is impaired after blocking the TGFbeta receptor I indicating that IL4-induced microglia alternative activation is dependent on active TGFbeta signalling. Interestingly, treatment of primary microglia with TGFbeta alone results in up regulation of the IL4 receptor alpha, indicating that TGFbeta increases the sensitivity of microglia for IL4 signals. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our data reveal a new role for TGFbeta during IL4-induced alternative activation of microglia and consolidate the essential functions of TGFbeta as an anti-inflammatory molecule and immunoregulatory factor for microglia.
