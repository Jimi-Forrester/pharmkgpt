24712144|a|A 48-year-old man with no remarkable medical history presented with upper abdominal pain for approximately 1 month. He was diagnosed as having pancreatic carcinoma with liver and lung metastasis and complicating carcinomatous peritonitis. Despite chemotherapy, his performance status worsened, his appetite deteriorated, and his pain became intolerable. The patient opted to return home for palliative care, and his parents, aged over 70 years, supported this decision. Although corticosteroid and opiate administration was attempted to improve appetite loss and pain, oral administration became difficult over a short span of time. Thus, treatment was switched from oxycodone to a fentanyl patch for opioid rotation. We also prescribed risperidone for the treatment of delirium. The patient once opted for "respite hospitalization" at a general hospital to relieve his aged parents' fatigue, and thereafter, he finally died at home. When rapid disease progression is expected, not only should a fully equipped environment for patients be ensured but concern for their caregivers should also be considered. For this purpose, cooperation and communication among multidisciplinary medical staff is indispensable.
