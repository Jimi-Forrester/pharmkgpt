25431401|a|BACKGROUND: The perception of old age differs in different societies and cultures: in the Western societies, the loss of youth, multiple losses of functions and independence resulting in inability produce a social stigma. Dementia is common among the elderly, regardless of their ethnic background. In countries dominated by Western philosophical thought, the cognitive domain has been privileged over other mental domains. Knowledge of cultural factors is essential to an understanding of aging and dementia; studies are currently dominated by biomedical models that consider dementing disorders solely as a pathological entity caused by neuronal and neurotrasmitters loss, and focus on the individual without regard to sociocultural context. AIM: The purpose of this study is to explore how the phenomenon of dementia is perceived in ethnically diverse groups and cultures. METHODS: Medline and Google Scholar searches were conducted for relevant articles, chapters and books published before 2014. Search terms used included anthropology, culture, ethnic elderly and dementia. Publications found through this indexed search were reviewed for further relevant references. RESULTS: The experience of dementia is not universal, but is profoundly shaped by culture in which the demented person lives. Sociocultural conceptualization of the symptoms of dementing diseases remains obscure in many countries. CONCLUSION: Sociocultural conceptualization of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias is of growing interest in shaping the interpretation of the symptoms of dementing diseases. To explore the intersection of culture with the expression of dementia may optimize the management of these complex and chronic conditions.
