16258851|a|The incidence of Alzheimer's disease is elevated after exposure to surgical interventions. Since amyloid precursor protein (APP) and its neurotoxic derivatives play key roles in the development of Alzheimer dementia, the role of general anesthesia is controversial in the development of cognitive decline. As such, the effect of anesthetics on APP protein and mRNA levels was assessed utilizing semiquantitative Western-immunoblot and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in brains of rats following intraperitoneal treatment with propofol and thiopental. The anesthetics did not change cortical APP protein and mRNA concentration considerably. These results indicate that both propofol and thiopental are considered to be relatively safe with respect to APP metabolism.
