37822091|t|miRNAs from Inflamed Gingiva Link Gene Signaling to Increased MET Expression.
37822091|a|Several array-based microRNA (miRNA) expression studies independently showed increased expression of miRNAs hsa-miR-130a-3p, -142-3p, -144-3p, -144-5p, -223-3p, -17-5p, and -30e-5p in gingiva affected by periodontal inflammation. We aimed to determine direct target genes and signaling pathways regulated by these miRNAs to identify processes relevant to gingival inflammatory responses and tissue homeostasis. We transfected miRNA mimics (mirVana) for each of the 7 miRNAs separately into human primary gingival fibroblasts cultured from 3 different donors. Following RNA sequencing, differential gene expression and second-generation gene set enrichment analyses were performed. miRNA inhibition and upregulation was validated at the transcript and protein levels using quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting, and reporter gene assays. All 7 miRNAs significantly increased expression of the gene MET proto-oncogene, receptor tyrosine kinase (MET). Expression of known periodontitis risk genes CPEB1, ABCA1, and ATP6V1C1 was significantly repressed by hsa-miR-130a-3p, -144-3p, and -144-5p, respectively. The genes WASL, ENPP5, ARL6IP1, and IDH1 showed the most significant and strongest downregulation after hsa-miR-142-3p, -17-5p, -223-3p, and -30e-5p transfection, respectively. The most significantly regulated gene set of each miRNA related to cell cycle (hsa-miRNA-144-3p and -5p [Padj = 4 x 10-40 and Padj = 4 x 10-6], -miR-17-5p [Padj = 9.5 x 10-23], -miR-30e-5p [Padj = 8.2 x 10-18], -miR-130a-3p [Padj = 5 x 10-15]), integrin cell surface interaction (-miR-223-3p [Padj = 2.4 x 10-7]), and interferon signaling (-miR-142-3p [Padj = 5 x 10-11]). At the end of acute inflammation, gingival miRNAs bring together complex regulatory networks that lead to increased expression of the gene MET. This underscores the importance of mesenchymal cell migration and invasion during gingival tissue remodeling and proliferation in restoring periodontal tissue homeostasis after active inflammation. MET, a receptor of the mitogenic hepatocyte growth factor fibroblast secreted, is a core gene of this process.
