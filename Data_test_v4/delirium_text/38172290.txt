38172290|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is considered the leading cause of dementia in the elderly worldwide. It results in progressive memory loss and impairment of cognitive and motor skills, leading to a high degree of disability and dependence. The development of AD is associated with the accumulation of senile plaques in the brain, caused by the amyloidogenic pathway of the disease. Several genetic and biochemical events are linked to AD development, with oxidative stress being one of them. Due to the scarcity of drugs aimed at treating AD, antioxidant compounds are increasingly studied as therapeutic targets for the disease. In this study, we investigate the antioxidant and anti-Alzheimer potential of the Tetragonisca angustula (Jatai) pollen extract in a Drosophila melanogaster Alzheimer's model. For this purpose, we utilized a D. melanogaster AD-like model, which expresses genes related to the amyloidogenic pathway of Alzheimer's disease. We explored the floral origin of the collected pollen, conducted phytochemical prospecting, and evaluated its antioxidant capacity in vitro. In vivo experiments involved assessing the survival and climbing ability of the D. melanogaster AD-like model with various concentrations of the pollen extract. Our findings revealed that the pollen extract of Tetragonisca angustula exhibits a significant antioxidant response and high concentrations of important phytochemicals, such as flavonoids and polyphenols. Furthermore, it enhanced the survival rate of D. melanogaster, and across all concentrations tested, it improved the climbing ability of the flies after 15 days of treatment with methanolic pollen extract. Additionally, the pollen extract reduced the neurodegeneration index in histopathological analysis. Thus, our study demonstrates the potential of Tetragonisca angustula pollen as an important subject for further investigation, aiming to isolate molecules that could potentially serve as therapeutic targets for Alzheimer's disease.
