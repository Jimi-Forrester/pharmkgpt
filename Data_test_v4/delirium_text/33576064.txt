33576064|t|Smarthealth technology study protocol to improve relationships between older adults with dementia and family caregivers.
33576064|a|AIM: The aim of this study is to develop a Smarthealth system of monitoring, modelling, and interactive recommendation solutions (for caregivers) for in-home dementia patient care that focuses on caregiver-patient relationships. DESIGN: This descriptive study employs a single-group, non-randomized trial to examine functionality, effectiveness, feasibility, and acceptability of the novel Smarthealth system. METHODS: Thirty persons with Alzheimer's Disease or related dementia and their family caregivers (N = 30 dyads) will receive and install Smarthealth technology in their home. There will be a 1-month observation phase for collecting baseline mood states and a 2-month implementation phase when caregivers will receive stress management techniques for each detected, negative mood state. Caregivers will report technique implementation and usefulness, sent via Ecological Momentary Assessment system to the study-provided smartphone. Caregivers will provide daily, self-reported mood and health ratings. Instruments measuring caregiver assessment of disruptive behaviours and their effect on caregivers; caregiver depressive symptoms, anxiety and stress; caregiver strain; and family functioning will be completed at baseline and 3 months. The study received funding in 2018 and ethics board approval in 2019. DISCUSSION: This study will develop and test novel in-home technology to improve family caregiving relationships. Results from this study will help develop and improve the Smarthealth recommendation system and determine its usefulness, feasibility, and acceptability for persons with dementia and their family caregiver. IMPACT: The Smarthealth technology discussed will provide in-home stress reduction resources at a time when older adults may be experiencing increasingly high rates of isolation and anxiety and caregiver dyads may be experiencing high levels of relationship strain. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study was registered with Clinical Trials.gov (Identifier NCT04536701).
