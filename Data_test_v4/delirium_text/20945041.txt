20945041|a|There is a close correlation between type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) in the course of pathophysiological processes. The neuroprotective action of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), a latest drug for clinical treatment of T2DM, is being more deeply investigated at present, and a novel therapeutic strategy for AD with GLP-1 has been proposed boldly. This review mainly discussed the correlation of pathogenesis between T2DM and AD, the synthesis and secretion of GLP-1, the distribution and physiological effects of GLP-1 receptor in the brain, and the progresses on the study of GLP-1 in the treatment of AD.
