37711254|a|Objective: To we examine the temporal patterns of the burden of Alzheimer's disease and their association with Sociodemographic Index in countries with varying rates of aging. Method: Data were obtained from Global Burden of Diseases studies (GBD) 2019 and were used to compare countries with different rates of change in aging population from 1990 to 2019. We collected the data of the age-standardized rates per 100,000 of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), incidence, prevalence of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, and the age-specific population rates per 100,000. Results: Countries with high rates of change in their aging populations had an increase in DALYs, incidence, and prevalence of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias over the last 30 years. Countries with a high rate of change in aging population had a significantly positive association among DALYs, incidence, and prevalence of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. In contrast, countries with a medium and low rate of change in aging population had negative associations between DALYs and incidence of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. Conclusion: This study highlights the significant impact of demographic changes on the burden, prevalence, and incidence of Alzheimer's disease and other dementia. The study also found that robust health care and social systems, as reflected by a higher Sociodemographic Index, can contribute to reducing the burden of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias in medium to low rates of aging populations. The findings underscore the importance of investing in health care and social systems to address the growing burden of these conditions, especially in countries with a high rate of change in the aging population.
