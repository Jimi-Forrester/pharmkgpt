15989517|t|Donepezil (E2020): a new acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. Review of its pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and utility in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
15989517|a|Donepezil is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor under development for the treatment of mild-moderately Alzheimer's disease. In vitro, donepezil is about 10 times more potent than tacrine as an inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase. Donepezil is 500 - 1000 fold selective for acetylcholinesterase over butyrylcholinesterase. In animal models, donepezil produces positive effects on both working memory and long term memory. In man, donepezil is slowly absorbed from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The compound has a terminal elimination half-life of 50 - 70 h in young volunteers; in elderly volunteers, the half-life of the compound is extended to over 100 h. Donepezil is extensively metabolised after oral administration. The parent compound is 93% bound to plasma proteins. Results from two clinical trials with donepezil were published. The largest of these trials was a 12 week 161 patient Phase II investigation in the USA. Results from this investigation showed that donepezil produced dose-related improvements, with statistically significant effects occurring at doses of 3 and 5 mg/day. The results published to date suggest that donepezil will be a useful agent in the symptomatic treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
