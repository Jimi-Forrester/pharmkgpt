35542994|t|Therapeutic Targets for Alzheimer's Disease: Amyloid Vs. Non-Amyloid. Where Does Consensus Lie Today? An CTAD Task Force Report.
35542994|a|There was consensus that both amyloid and tau pathologies should be targeted in Alzheimer's disease, as well as additional pathophysiological mechanisms such as neuroinflammation. The selection of one or both of these targets may depend upon a personalized approach that takes into account the genetic and acquired factors that cause AD in any given person as well as their stage of disease as reflected in a biomarker profile. The validation of this therapeutic approach will be made possible by new methodologies for subdividing into predominant pathology, by efficient methods for identifying people in the earliest stages of disease, and by combination studies.
