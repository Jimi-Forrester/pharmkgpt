37643030|t|Association of Postoperative Delirium With Incident Dementia and Graft Outcomes Among Kidney Transplant Recipients.
37643030|a|BACKGROUND: Kidney transplant (KT) recipients have numerous risk factors for delirium, including those shared with the general surgical population (eg, age and major surgery) and transplant-specific factors (eg, neurotoxic immunosuppression medications). Evidence has linked delirium to long-term dementia risk in older adults undergoing major surgery. We sought to characterize dementia risk associated with post-KT delirium. METHODS: Using the United States Renal Data System datasets, we identified 35 800 adult first-time KT recipients >=55 y. We evaluated risk factors for delirium using logistic regression. We evaluated the association between delirium and incident dementia (overall and by subtype: Alzheimer's, vascular, and other/mixed-type), graft loss, and death using Fine and Gray's subhazards models and Cox regression. RESULTS: During the KT hospitalization, 0.9% of recipients were diagnosed with delirium. Delirium risk factors included age (OR = 1.40, 95% CI, 1.28-1.52) and diabetes (OR = 1.38, 95% CI, 1.10-1.73). Delirium was associated with higher risk of death-censored graft loss (aHR = 1.52, 95% CI, 1.12-2.05) and all-cause mortality (aHR = 1.53, 95% CI, 1.25-1.89) at 5 y post-KT. Delirium was also associated with higher risk of dementia (adjusted subhazard ratio [aSHR] = 4.59, 95% CI, 3.48-6.06), particularly vascular dementia (aSHR = 2.51, 95% CI, 1.01-6.25) and other/mixed-type dementia (aSHR = 5.58, 95% CI, 4.24-7.62) subtypes. The risk of all-type dementia associated with delirium was higher for younger recipients aged between 55 and 64 y (Pinteraction = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Delirium is a strong risk factor for subsequent diagnosis of dementia among KT recipients, particularly those aged between 55 and 64 y at the time of transplant. Patients experiencing posttransplant delirium might benefit from early interventions to enhance cognitive health and surveillance for cognitive impairment to enable early referral for dementia care.
