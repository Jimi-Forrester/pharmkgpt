21888050|a|In Finland approximately 7,000 hip fractures occurred annually during 1996-2008. Risk of hip fracture can be diminished through efforts to prevent falls and osteoporosis. A hip fracture is treated operatively, with the aim of early mobilisation and full weight bearing. Postoperative care and rehabilitation requires multidisciplinary and multifaceted management, focusing on improvement of the patient's physical condition, appropriate pain management, the prevention of delirium and other possible complications. Rehabilitation should be centralised in specialised rehabilitation centres for the elderly. Secondary prevention of future fractures should include management of osteoporosis and fall prevention.
