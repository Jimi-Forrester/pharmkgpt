34948173|t|Systematic Review of Calcium Channels and Intracellular Calcium Signaling: Relevance to Pesticide Neurotoxicity.
34948173|a|Pesticides of different chemical classes exert their toxic effects on the nervous system by acting on the different regulatory mechanisms of calcium (Ca2+) homeostasis. Pesticides have been shown to alter Ca2+ homeostasis, mainly by increasing its intracellular concentration above physiological levels. The pesticide-induced Ca2+ overload occurs through two main mechanisms: the entry of Ca2+ from the extracellular medium through the different types of Ca2+ channels present in the plasma membrane or its release into the cytoplasm from intracellular stocks, mainly from the endoplasmic reticulum. It has also been observed that intracellular increases in the Ca2+ concentrations are maintained over time, because pesticides inhibit the enzymes involved in reducing its levels. Thus, the alteration of Ca2+ levels can lead to the activation of various signaling pathways that generate oxidative stress, neuroinflammation and, finally, neuronal death. In this review, we also discuss some proposed strategies to counteract the detrimental effects of pesticides on Ca2+ homeostasis.
