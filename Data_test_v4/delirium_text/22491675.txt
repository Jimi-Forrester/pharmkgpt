22491675|t|(E)-5-styryl-1H-indole and (E)-6-styrylquinoline derivatives serve as probes for beta-amyloid plaques.
22491675|a|We report the synthesis and biological evaluation of novel (E)-5-styryl-1H-indole and (E)-6-styrylquinoline derivatives as probes for imaging beta-amyloid (Abeta) plaques. These derivatives showed binding affinities for Abeta1-40 aggregates with K(i) values varying from 4.1 to 288.4 nM. (E)-5-(4-iodostyryl)-1H-indole (8) clearly stained Abeta plaques in the brain sections of Alzheimer's disease (AD) model mice (APP/PS1). Furthermore, autoradiography for [125I]8 displayed intense and specific labeling of Abeta plaques in the brain sections mentioned above with low background. In biodistribution experiments using normal mice [125I]8 showed high initial brain uptake followed by rapid washout (4.27 and 0.64% ID/g at 2 and 30 min post injection, respectively). These findings suggests that [123I]8 may be a potential SPECT imaging agent for detecting Abeta plaques in AD brain.
