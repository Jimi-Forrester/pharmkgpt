34703724|t|Diagnosis and Neurosurgical Management of Cerebral Nocardiosis.
34703724|a|Primary Nocardia infections are uncommon gram-positive bacterial infections caused by aerobic actinomycetes and are typically regarded as opportunistic infections (only one-third of infected patients are immunocompetent). Risk factors include: glucocorticoid therapy, malignancy, organ transplant recipients, human immunodeficiency virus infections, tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitor therapy, diabetes mellitus, alcoholism, inflammatory bowel disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic granulomatous disease, and tuberculosis. The organism has a predisposition to disseminate to the central nervous system and can relapse or progress despite appropriate therapy. Treatment ranges from oral antibiotic management to multiple intravenous antibiotic therapy, with surgical intervention required for severe cases. The surgical options include aspiration or complete excision of abscess contents and capsule. In the present case, we describe the use of bilateral craniotomy with assisted image guidance and multiple abscess excision in an immunocompetent patient with systemic nocardiosis.
