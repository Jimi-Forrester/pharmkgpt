9121723|a|The frequency of the allele-1 polymorphism in intron 8 of the presenilin-1 (PS-1) gene, and the proportion of individuals homozygous in this respect, was investigated in 57 patients with autopsy verified Alzheimer's disease (AD). In 33 of these patients the amount of amyloid beta protein (A beta) was compared across the three PS-1 genotype groups (1/1, 1/2, 2/2). No excess of the allele-1 was detected in these patients with confirmed AD and no variations in the extent of A beta deposition, as either A beta 40 or A beta 42, in terms of plaque number or percentage area of tissue occupied, were found. We conclude that this intronic PS-1 polymorphism does not influence the pathological phenotype of AD, at least as far as A beta deposition is concerned.
