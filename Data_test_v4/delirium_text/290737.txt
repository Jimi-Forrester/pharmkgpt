290737|t|Pathophysiology of delirious states.
290737|a|MHPG concentration in CSF, urinary excretion of NA and A as well as activity of serum DBH were significantly elevated during alcohol delirium as compared to the recovery period. Urinary DA and HVA in CSF did not show any constant change. One single dosage of clozapine (100 mg orally) induces higher urinary NA and A excretion. There is a time course of clozapine action. MHPG in rat brain a single dosage (50 mg/kg) is elevated; after repeated administration (11 days) a decrease is observed. After 10 days of treatment with clozapine (300 mg/day) a decrease of MHPG in CSF can be seen. It is hypothesized that there is a relationship between delirious states and increases central NA turnover.
