34630020|t|Retinal Vasculopathy in Alzheimer's Disease.
34630020|a|The retina has been increasingly investigated as a site of Alzheimer's disease (AD) manifestation for over a decade. Early reports documented degeneration of retinal ganglion cells and their axonal projections. Our group provided the first evidence of the key pathological hallmarks of AD, amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) plaques including vascular Abeta deposits, in the retina of AD and mild cognitively impaired (MCI) patients. Subsequent studies validated these findings and further identified electroretinography and vision deficits, retinal (p)tau and inflammation, intracellular Abeta accumulation, and retinal ganglion cell-subtype degeneration surrounding Abeta plaques in these patients. Our data suggest that the brain and retina follow a similar trajectory during AD progression, probably due to their common embryonic origin and anatomical proximity. However, the retina is the only CNS organ feasible for direct, repeated, and non-invasive ophthalmic examination with ultra-high spatial resolution and sensitivity. Neurovascular unit integrity is key to maintaining normal CNS function and cerebral vascular abnormalities are increasingly recognized as early and pivotal factors driving cognitive impairment in AD. Likewise, retinal vascular abnormalities such as changes in vessel density and fractal dimensions, blood flow, foveal avascular zone, curvature tortuosity, and arteriole-to-venule ratio were described in AD patients including early-stage cases. A rapidly growing number of reports have suggested that cerebral and retinal vasculopathy are tightly associated with cognitive deficits in AD patients and animal models. Importantly, we recently identified early and progressive deficiency in retinal vascular platelet-derived growth factor receptor-beta (PDGFRbeta) expression and pericyte loss that were associated with retinal vascular amyloidosis and cerebral amyloid angiopathy in MCI and AD patients. Other studies utilizing optical coherence tomography (OCT), retinal amyloid-fluorescence imaging and retinal hyperspectral imaging have made significant progress in visualizing and quantifying AD pathology through the retina. With new advances in OCT angiography, OCT leakage, scanning laser microscopy, fluorescein angiography and adaptive optics imaging, future studies focusing on retinal vascular AD pathologies could transform non-invasive pre-clinical AD diagnosis and monitoring.
