9364575|a|The integrity of the cerebral vasculature is crucial to the maintenance of cognitive functions during ageing. Prevailing evidence suggests that cerebrovascular functions decline during normal ageing, with pronounced effects in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The causes of these changes largely remain unknown. While previous studies recorded ageing-related impairments, such as atherosclerosis and loss of innervation in basal surface arteries of the brain, it only recently has been realized that a number of subtle alterations in both the intracranial resistance vessels and the smaller capillaries is apparent in both ageing animals and humans. The dominant changes include alterations in composition of connective tissues and smooth muscle of large vessel walls, thickening of the vascular basement membrane, thinning of the endothelium in some species, loss of endothelial mitochondria and increased pericytes. Some of these attributes appear more affected in AD. Other abnormalities entail profound irregularities in the course of microvessels, unexplained inclusions in the basement membrane and changes in unique proteins and membrane lipids associated with the blood-brain barrier. Brain imaging and permeability studies show no clear functional evidence to support the structural and biochemical anomalies, but it is plausible that focal and transient breach of the blood-brain barrier in ageing, and more notably in AD, occurs. Thus, circumscribed neuronal populations in certain brain regions could become vulnerable. Furthermore, the characteristic deposition of amyloid in vessels in AD may exacerbate the decline in vascular function and promote chronic hypoperfusion. Although not explicit from current studies, it is likely that the brain vasculature is continually modified by growth and repair mechanisms in attempts to maintain perfusion during ageing and disease.
