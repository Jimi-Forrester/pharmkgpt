36433398|t|Technological Solutions for Social Isolation Monitoring of the Elderly: A Survey of Selected Projects from Academia and Industry.
36433398|a|Social isolation is likely to be one of the most serious health outcomes for the elderly due to the COVID-19 pandemic, especially for seniors living alone at home. In fact, two approaches have been used to assess social isolation. The first is a self-reported survey designed for research purposes. The second approach is the use of monitoring technology. The objective of this paper is to provide some illustrative publications, works and examples of the current status and future prospects in the field of monitoring systems that focused on two main activities of daily living: meal-taking activity (shopping, cooking, eating and washing dishes) and mobility (inside the home and the act of going out). These two activities combined seem relevant to a potential risk of social isolation in the elderly. Although current research focuses on identifying only ADLs, we propose to use them as a first step to extract daily habits and risk level of social isolation. Moreover, since activity recognition is a recent field, we raise specific problems as well as needed contributions and we propose directions and research opportunities to accelerate advances in this field.
