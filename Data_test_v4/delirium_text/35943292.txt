35943292|t|Endoplasmic reticulum stress induces Alzheimer disease-like phenotypes in the neuron derived from the induced pluripotent stem cell with D678H mutation on amyloid precursor protein.
35943292|a|Alzheimer disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, is mainly caused by the interaction of genetic and environmental factors. The impact of environmental factors on the genetic mutation in the amyloid precursor protein (APP) is not well characterized. We hypothesized that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress would promote disease for the patient carrying the APP D678H mutation. Therefore, we analyzed the impact of a familial AD mutation on amyloid precursor protein (APP D678H) under ER stress. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from APP D678H mutant carrier was differentiated into neurons, which were then analyzed for AD-like changes. Immunocytochemistry and whole-cell patch-clamp recording revealed that the derived neurons on day 28 after differentiation showed neuronal markers and electrophysiological properties similar to those of mature neurons. However, the APP D678H mutant neurons did not have significant alterations in the levels of amyloid-beta (Abeta) and phosphorylated tau (pTau) compared to its isogenic wild-type neurons. Only under ER stress, the neurons with the APP D678H mutation had more Abeta and pTau via immune detection assays. The higher level of Abeta in the APP D678H mutant neurons was probably due to the increased level of beta-site APP cleaving enzyme (BACE1) and decreased level of Abeta-degrading enzymes under ER stress. Increased Abeta and pTau under ER stress reduced the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) in Western blot analysis and altered electrophysiological properties in the mutant neurons. Our study provides evidence that the interaction between genetic mutation and ER stress would induce AD-like changes. Cover Image for this issue: https://doi.org/10.1111/jnc.15420.
