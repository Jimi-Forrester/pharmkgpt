38454820|t|2023 Korean sexually transmitted infections guidelines for non-gonococcal bacterial infection (chlamydia, syphilis, etc.) by the Korean Association of Urogenital Tract Infection and Inflammation.
38454820|a|Non-gonococcal sexually transmitted infections (STIs) include chlamydia, syphilis, and chancroids. Chlamydia is the most common STI caused by Chlamydia trachomatis and is mainly transmitted through sexual intercourse or vertical transmission at birth. Although symptoms are mostly absent or mild, untreated chlamydial infections in females can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease, chronic pelvic pain, and infertility due to the narrowing of fallopian tubes. Syphilis is caused by Treponema pallidum and is divided into phase I, phase II, latent syphilis, and phase III. The incidence of syphilis, including congenital syphilis, has significantly increased in the United States in recent years. The chronic status of this disease can significantly increase morbidity and potentially affect almost all body organs, which, in rare cases, can lead to death. Additionally, untreated maternal syphilis can lead to fetal death and fatal congenital infections in newborns. Chancroid is an STI caused by Haemophilus ducreyi, and its prevalence is gradually decreasing in Korea and worldwide. The symptoms include shallow genital ulcers with suppurative granulomatous inflammation and tender inguinal lymphadenopathy. Chancroids can be differentiated from syphilitic chancres based on their appearance. In contrast to painless chancres, chancroids are painful. Ureaplasma urealyticum, Ureaplasma parvum, and Mycoplasma hominis are considered symbiotic bacteria. Infections caused by these bacteria are usually not considered STIs and do not require treatment unless they are suspected of being associated with infertility. This article presents the 2023 Korean STI guidelines for non-gonococcal bacterial infections.
