39568104|t|A scoping review of dementia education programs to assess for the inclusion of culture.
39568104|a|This scoping review examined literature on dementia education programs (DEPs) for healthcare providers and students. The search was conducted using the Discover! search engine that includes 63 databases. The review included a total of 25 articles that met the eligibility criteria. There were numerous DEPs that varied by frequency and duration, mode of delivery, content, target population, program evaluation measures, and outcomes. Most involved nursing staff and students and took place in Canada, the US, and the UK. The most common delivery mode was a one-time in-person session and a wide variety of topics were covered, both general (e.g., understanding dementia) and specific (e.g., driving, delirium). Twenty different tools were used to measure primarily changes in knowledge and attitudes, with little attention paid to performance and care provision. Only three studies on DEPs focused on culture in terms of race and ethnicity. The implications of this scoping review for education are that DEPs need to meaningfully address culture and culturally safe care in order to respond to the increasing diversity of older adults and care providers. In terms of future research on DEPs, program evaluation must attend to the importance of consistent measures, translation of knowledge to practice, and sustainability.
