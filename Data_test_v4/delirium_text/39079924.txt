39079924|t|Delirium in neonates and infants: a scoping review protocol.
39079924|a|INTRODUCTION: Delirium in neonates and infants is difficult to screen or assess because of their different developmental features and distinct delirium characteristics compared with those of older children. Some delirium management strategies, including assessment, pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions, and prevention strategies, have been previously suggested for paediatric delirium. However, whether these strategies are effective for delirium in neonates and infants is unclear. This scoping review aims to explore comprehensive information on delirium in neonates and infants, such as the features of delirium, factors related to delirium, and current assessments and interventions in neonates and infants. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study will be based on the Joanna Briggs Institute guidelines for scoping review protocol development and follow each stage of the framework proposed by Arksey and O'Malley. Research questions regarding delirium management in neonates and infants will be specified. A wide range of databases, including MEDLINE, EBSCO, Embase and the Cochrane Library, using optimised terms will be searched from 2004 to 2024. The summarised results will be reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension of the Scoping Reviews checklist. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Since this study will review and summarise published scientific literature, ethical approval is not required. The results of this scoping review will be disseminated through conference presentations and peer-reviewed publications. The study findings will be disseminated through seminars for experts so that they can be reflected in practice.
