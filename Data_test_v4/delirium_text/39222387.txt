39222387|t|Nanoscale Structural Characterization of Amyloid beta 1-42 Oligomers and Fibrils Grown in the Presence of Fatty Acids.
39222387|a|Mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids (FAs) are broadly used as food supplements. However, their effect on the aggregation of amyloidogenic proteins remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the effect of a large number of mono- and polyunsaturated, as well as fully saturated FAs on the aggregation of amyloid beta1-42 (Abeta1-42) peptide. A progressive aggregation of this peptide is the expected molecular cause of Alzheimer's disease (AD), one of the most common neurodegenerative pathologies in the world. We found that arachidonic and stearic acids delayed the aggregation of Abeta1-42. Using Nano-Infrared spectroscopy, we found that FAs caused very little if any changes in the secondary structure of Abeta1-42 oligomers and fibrils formed at different stages of protein aggregation. However, the analyzed mono- and polyunsaturated, as well as fully saturated FAs uniquely altered the toxicity of Abeta1-42 fibrils. We found a direct relationship between the degree of FAs unsaturation and toxicity of Abeta1-42 fibrils formed in their presence. Specifically, with an increase in the degree of unsaturation, the toxicity Abeta1-42/FA fibrils increased. These results indicate that fully saturated or monounsaturated FAs could be used to decrease the toxicity of amyloid aggregates and, consequently, decelerate the development of AD.
