36120380|a|Disrupted tau proteostasis and transneuronal spread is a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. Neurodegenerative diseases remain an unmet medical need and novel disease modifying therapeutics are paramount. Our objective was to develop a mechanistic mathematical model to enhance our understanding of tau antibody pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in animals and humans. A physiologically-based pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PBPK-PD) modeling approach was employed to support the preclinical development and clinical translation of therapeutic antibodies targeting tau for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. The pharmacokinetics of a tau antibody was evaluated in rat and non-human primate microdialysis studies. Model validation for humans was performed using publicly available clinical data for gosuranemab. In-silico analyses were performed to predict tau engagement in human brain for a range of tau antibody affinities and various dosing regimens. PBPK-PD modeling enabled a quantitative understanding for the relationship between dose, affinity, and target engagement, which supported lead candidate optimization and predictions of clinically efficacious dosing regimens.
