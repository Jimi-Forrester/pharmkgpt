38685682|a|INTRODUCTION: In the last decade, the efforts conducted for discovering Alzheimer's Disease (AD) treatments targeting the best-known pathogenic factors [amyloid-beta (Abeta), tau protein, and neuroinflammation] were mostly unsuccessful. Given that a systemic failure of Abeta clearance was supposed to primarily contribute to AD development and progression, disease-modifying therapies with anti-Abeta monoclonal antibodies (e.g. solanezumab, bapineuzumab, gantenerumab, aducanumab, lecanemab and donanemab) are ongoing in randomized clinical trials (RCTs) with contrasting results. AREAS COVERED: The present Drug Discovery Case History analyzes the failures of RCTs of solanezumab on AD. Furthermore, the authors review the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and tolerability effect of solanezumab from preclinical studies with its analogous m266 in mice. Finally, they describe the RCTs with cognitive, cerebrospinal fluid and neuroimaging findings in mild-to-moderate AD (EXPEDITION studies) and in secondary prevention studies (A4 and DIAN-TU). EXPERT OPINION: Solanezumab was one of the first anti-Abeta monoclonal antibodies to be tested in preclinical and clinical AD showing to reduce brain Abeta level by acting on soluble monomeric form of Abeta peptide without significant results on deposits. Unfortunately, this compound showed to accelerate cognitive decline in both asymptomatic and symptomatic trial participants, and this failure of solanezumab further questioned the Abeta cascade hypothesis of AD.
