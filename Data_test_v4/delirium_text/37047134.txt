37047134|a|The importance of the prevention and control of non-communicable diseases, including obesity, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer, is increasing as a requirement of the aging population in developed countries and the sustainability of healthcare. Similarly, the 2013-2030 action plan of the WHO for the prevention and control of non-communicable diseases seeks these achievements. Adequate lifestyle changes, alone or with the necessary treatments, could reduce the risk of mortality or the deterioration of quality of life. In our recent work, we summarized the role of two central factors, i.e., appropriate levels of vitamin D and SIRT1, which are connected to adequate lifestyles with beneficial effects on the prevention and control of non-communicable diseases. Both of these factors have received increased attention in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic as they both take part in regulation of the main metabolic processes, i.e., lipid/glucose/energy homeostasis, oxidative stress, redox balance, and cell fate, as well as in the healthy regulation of the immune system. Vitamin D and SIRT1 have direct and indirect influence of the regulation of transcription and epigenetic changes and are related to cytoplasmic signaling pathways such as PLC/DAG/IP3/PKC/MAPK, MEK/Erk, insulin/mTOR/cell growth, proliferation; leptin/PI3K-Akt-mTORC1, Akt/NFkB/COX-2, NFkB/TNFalpha, IL-6, IL-8, IL-1beta, and AMPK/PGC-1alpha/GLUT4, among others. Through their proper regulation, they maintain normal body weight, lipid profile, insulin secretion and sensitivity, balance between the pro- and anti-inflammatory processes under normal conditions and infections, maintain endothelial health; balance cell differentiation, proliferation, and fate; and balance the circadian rhythm of the cellular metabolism. The role of these two molecules is interconnected in the molecular network, and they regulate each other in several layers of the homeostasis of energy and the cellular metabolism. Both have a central role in the maintenance of healthy and balanced immune regulation and redox reactions; therefore, they could constitute promising targets either for prevention or as complementary therapies to achieve a better quality of life, at any age, for healthy people and patients under chronic conditions.
