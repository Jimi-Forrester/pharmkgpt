37770948|a|BACKGROUND: Without a viable cure, chronic kidney disease is a global health concern. Inflammatory damage in and around the renal tubules dictates disease severity and is contributed to by multiple cell types. Activated in response to danger associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) including ATP, the NOD-like receptor protein-3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is integral to this inflammation. In vivo, we have previously observed that increased expression of Connexin 43 (Cx43) is linked to inflammation in chronic kidney disease (CKD) whilst in vitro studies in human proximal tubule cells highlight a role for aberrant Cx43 hemichannel mediated ATP release in tubule injury. A role for Cx43 hemichannels in priming and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in tubule epithelial cells remains to be determined. METHODS: Using the Nephroseq database, analysis of unpublished transcriptomic data, examined gene expression and correlation in human CKD. The unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) mouse model was combined with genetic (tubule-specific Cx43 knockout) and specific pharmacological blockade of Cx43 (Peptide5), to explore a role for Cx43-hemichannels in tubule damage. Human primary tubule epithelial cells were used as an in vitro model of CKD. RESULTS: Increased Cx43 and NLRP3 expression correlates with declining glomerular filtration rate and increased proteinuria in biopsies isolated from patients with CKD. Connexin 43-tubule deletion prior to UUO protected against tubular injury, increased expression of proinflammatory molecules, and significantly reduced NLRP3 expression and downstream signalling mediators. Accompanied by a reduction in F4/80 macrophages and fibroblast specific protein (FSP1+) fibroblasts, Cx43 specific hemichannel blocker Peptide5 conferred similar protection in UUO mice. In vitro, Peptide5 determined that increased Cx43-hemichannel activity primes and activates the NLRP3 inflammasome via ATP-P2X7 receptor signalling culminating in increased secretion of chemokines and cytokines, each of which are elevated in individuals with CKD. Inhibition of NLRP3 and caspase 1 similarly decreased markers of tubular injury, whilst preventing the perpetual increase in Cx43-hemichannel activity. CONCLUSION: Aberrant Cx43-hemichannel activity in kidney tubule cells contributes to tubule inflammation via activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and downstream paracrine mediated cell signalling. Use of hemichannel blockers in targeting Cx43-hemichannels is an attractive future therapeutic target to slow or prevent disease progression in CKD. Video Abstract.
