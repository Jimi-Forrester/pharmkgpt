34053034|t|Overcoming delivery barriers in immunotherapy for glioblastoma.
34053034|a|Glioblastoma is one of the deadliest forms of primary adult tumors, with median survival of 14.6 months post-diagnosis despite aggressive standard of care treatment. This grim prognosis for glioblastoma patients has changed little in the past two decades, necessitating novel treatment modalities. One potential treatment modality is cancer immunotherapy, which has shown remarkable progress in slowing disease progression or even potentially curing certain solid tumors. However, the transport barriers posed by the blood-brain barrier and the immune privileged status of the central nervous system pose drug delivery obstacles that are unique to brain tumors. In this review, we provide an overview of the various physiological, immunological, and drug delivery barriers that must be overcome for effective glioblastoma treatment. We discuss chemical modification strategies to enable nanomedicines to bypass the blood-brain barrier and reach intracranial tumors. Finally, we highlight recent advances in biomaterial-based strategies for cancer immunotherapy that can be adapted to glioblastoma treatment.
