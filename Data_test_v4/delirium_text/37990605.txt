37990605|t|Abalone peptide increases stress resilience and cost-free longevity via SKN-1-governed transcriptional metabolic reprogramming in C. elegans.
37990605|a|A major goal of healthy aging is to prevent declining resilience and increasing frailty, which are associated with many chronic diseases and deterioration of stress response. Here, we propose a loss-or-gain survival model, represented by the ratio of cumulative stress span to life span, to quantify stress resilience at organismal level. As a proof of concept, this is demonstrated by reduced survival resilience in Caenorhabditis elegans exposed to exogenous oxidative stress induced by paraquat or with endogenous proteotoxic stress caused by polyglutamine or amyloid-beta aggregation. Based on this, we reveal that a hidden peptide ("cryptide")-AbaPep#07 (SETYELRK)-derived from abalone hemocyanin not only enhances survival resilience against paraquat-induced oxidative stress but also rescues proteotoxicity-mediated behavioral deficits in C. elegans, indicating its capacity against stress and neurodegeneration. Interestingly, AbaPep#07 is also found to increase cost-free longevity and age-related physical fitness in nematodes. We then demonstrate that AbaPep#07 can promote nuclear localization of SKN-1/Nrf, but not DAF-16/FOXO, transcription factor. In contrast to its effects in wild-type nematodes, AbaPep#07 cannot increase oxidative stress survival and physical motility in loss-of-function skn-1 mutant, suggesting an SKN-1/Nrf-dependent fashion of these effects. Further investigation reveals that AbaPep#07 can induce transcriptional activation of immune defense, lipid metabolism, and metabolic detoxification pathways, including many SKN-1/Nrf target genes. Together, our findings demonstrate that AbaPep#07 is able to boost stress resilience and reduce behavioral frailty via SKN-1/Nrf-governed transcriptional reprogramming, and provide an insight into the health-promoting potential of antioxidant cryptides as geroprotectors in aging and associated conditions.
