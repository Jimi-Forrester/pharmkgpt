17324514|t|ABCA1 polymorphisms and Alzheimer's disease.
17324514|a|In our search for genetic factors related to the development of Alzheimer's disease, we have genotyped 332 pedigrees for three coding polymorphisms in the ABCA1 gene, two of which are known to alter plasma cholesterol levels, as well as a non-coding polymorphism within the promoter. We show an apparent weak association of rs2230806 (p-value=0.01) with the disease in a sibpair series of Alzheimer's disease that had shown previously evidence for linkage to the chromosome 9 locus where ABCA1 maps.
