OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether incident AED use is associated with an increased risk of pneumonia among community-dwelling persons with Alzheimer's disease (AD). In addition, we determined the risk according to duration of AED use and specific AEDs. METHODS: Persons with AD were identified from the MEDALZ dataset which includes all community-dwelling persons who received a clinically verified diagnosis of AD during 2005-2011 in Finland (N=70,718). New AED users were identified with one-year washout period. A matched cohort (1 : 1, N=5,769, matching criteria age, gender, and time since AD diagnoses) of nonusers was formed. Data from nationwide registers included dispensed medications which were modelled with PRE2DUP method, hospitalizations, and causes of death. The association between AED use and hospital admission or death due to pneumonia was analyzed with Cox proportional hazard models. RESULTS: AED use was associated with an increased risk of pneumonia (adjusted HR 1.92, 95% CI 1.63-2.26; incidence rate per 100 person-years 12.58, 95% CI 12.49-12.66 during AED use and 6.41, 95% CI 6.37-6.45 during nonuse). The highest risk was observed during the first month of use (aHR 3.59, 95% CI 2.29-5.61) and the risk remained elevated until two years of use. Of specific drug substances, phenytoin, carbamazepine, valproic acid, and pregabalin were associated with an increased risk. CONCLUSION: Antiepileptic drug use may increase the risk of pneumonia which is concerning as persons with AD have elevated risk of pneumonia.
