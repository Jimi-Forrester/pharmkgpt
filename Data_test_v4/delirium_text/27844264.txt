27844264|a|BACKGROUND: Anastomotic leakage is a severe complication after esophagectomy. The objective was to investigate the diagnostic and predictive value of routine contrast swallow study and endoscopy for the detection of anastomotic dehiscence in patients after esophagectomy. METHODS: All patients who underwent contrast swallow and/or endoscopy within 7 days after oesophagectomy for cancer between January 2005 and December 2009 were selected from an institutional database. RESULTS: Some 173 patients underwent endoscopy, and 184 patients underwent a contrast swallow study. The sensitivity of endoscopy for anastomotic leakage requiring intervention is 56 %, specificity 41 %, positive predictive value (PPV) 8 %, and negative predictive value (NPV) 95 %. The sensitivity of contrast swallow study for detecting leakage requiring intervention in patients without signs of leakage was 20 %, specificity 20 %, PPV 3 %, and NPV 97 %. CONCLUSIONS: In patients without clinical suspicion of leakage, there is no benefit to perform routine examinations.
