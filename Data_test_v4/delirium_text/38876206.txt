38876206|t|Comparing Clinical Characteristics and Short-Term Outcomes Between Adult and Geriatric Patients Undergoing Charcot Reconstruction.
38876206|a|Maintaining an acceptable quality of life following a lifetime of chronic diseases and resulting physiologic effects poses a challenge when treating an aging population. In those with Charcot neuroarthropathy, wounds, and infection complicate decision making when considering limb preservation versus amputation. The purpose of this investigation is to describe the clinical characteristics and short-term outcomes of geriatric patients undergoing Charcot reconstruction. A retrospective chart review of patients who underwent Charcot reconstruction from 2016 to 2022 was conducted. Demographics, medical history, deformity type, surgical intervention, discharge planning, and short-term complications were collected. Descriptive statistics were calculated, and clinical characteristics and short-term outcomes were compared between the non-geriatric, adult (A) and geriatric (G) cohorts using Student's t-test or chi-squared test. Overall, 125 patients were reviewed for final analysis. Charcot deformity type, prevalence of wounds, osteomyelitis, and fixation construct did not significantly differ between groups. While the proportion of those experiencing a prolonged admission did not significantly differ between cohorts, the geriatric group showed age-related pathology including delirium and urinary tract infections. While discharge to nursing facilities did differ between groups (G 43% versus A 19%), baseline function did not. The 30-day unplanned readmission and mortality rates did differ between groups, though this difference was not statistically significant. Prior to geriatric Charcot reconstruction, consideration should be given to age-related comorbidities. Specifically, with a greater incidence of age-related complications unrelated to the surgery as well as mortality in the geriatric group, complications should be discussed at length.
