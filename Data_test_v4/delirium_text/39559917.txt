39559917|a|New possibilities of biomarker-based predictive technologies for Alzheimer's disease (AD) have become more reliable as well as more accessible. Standardized clinical recommendations and guidance for counseling and disclosure in this context are not yet well developed. Our scoping review identified publications from database searches in PubMed, PsycINFO, LIVIVO, and Web of Science. Inclusion criteria were: (1) information or counseling, (2) biomarkers and a type of cognitive impairment or AD, and (3) published between 2005 and 2024. We identified 63 articles and synthesized them along the categories of staged information provision: pre-test counseling, disclosure, and post-disclosure follow-up. Most publications referred to the context of disclosure (48), followed by pre-test counseling (33), and post-disclosure follow-up (31). Some publications referred to all stages of counseling (17). Our findings highlight the need to further develop and specify comprehensive and standardized guidelines for counseling, disclosure, and post-disclosure follow-up in the context of AD biomarker testing. HIGHLIGHTS: New possibilities of biomarker-based predictive technologies for Alzheimer's disease (AD) have become more reliable and also more accessible. However, clinical recommendations and guidance for counseling and disclosure in the context of AD biomarker testing are currently not well developed. We carried out a scoping review with the aim to generate an overview of the scientific literature and guidance available regarding counseling, biomarker test result and dementia risk disclosure, and clinical management prior to and in the course of a biomarker-based diagnosis in early stages of AD. We identified 63 relevant articles. Most publications referred to the context of disclosure (48), followed by pre-test counseling (33), and post-disclosure follow-up (31). Some publications referred to all stages of counseling (17). Our findings highlight the urgent need for national and international consensus guidelines for comprehensive and staged counseling and disclosure practices. While most publications identify relevant ethical challenges posed for counseling practices in the context of AD biomarker testing, they rarely present any practical recommendations for clinicians, on how and what to counsel on a concrete level.
