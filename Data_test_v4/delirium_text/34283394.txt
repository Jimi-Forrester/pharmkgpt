34283394|t|Sutureless aortic valve with supracoronary ascending aortic replacement as an alternative strategy for composite graft replacement in elderly patients.
34283394|a|Aortic valve disease is frequently associated with ascending aorta dilatation and can be treated either by separate replacement of the aortic valve and ascending aorta or by a composite valve graft. The type of surgery is depending on the exact location of the aortic dilatation and the concomitant valvular procedures required. The evidence for elective aortic surgery in elderly high-risk patients remains challenging and therefore alternative strategies could be warranted. We propose an alternative strategy for the treatment of ascending aortic aneurysm and aortic valve pathology with the use of a sutureless, collapsible, stent-mounted aortic valve prosthesis.
