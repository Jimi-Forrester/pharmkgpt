10803624|t|Management of alcohol withdrawal in microvascular head and neck reconstruction.
10803624|a|Alcohol use is a risk factor for head and neck cancer. One of the primary therapeutic modalities is surgical tumor ablation followed by immediate reconstruction. Such therapy places patients in a controlled environment, without alcohol, creating the risk of alcohol withdrawal syndrome. The authors attempted to identify the incidence of alcohol withdrawal among patients undergoing free-flap reconstruction for head and neck cancer and were interested in the effect of alcohol withdrawal on the postoperative course of affected patients. In this retrospective review of 51 patients, six experienced alcohol withdrawal or delirium tremens. No difference in the rate of overall complications was seen between the patients who experienced withdrawal and those who did not, although patients who experienced withdrawal did have a statistically significant ratio of non-flap-related to flap-related complications. A review of the current management for alcohol withdrawal is included and places an emphasis on preoperative screening, close observation, rapid diagnosis, and immediate medical care.
