33851473|a|Phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP) is a complex glycosylated protein that mediates the transfer of phospholipids, unesterified cholesterol, diacylglycerides, specific apolipoproteins, and tocopherols between different classes of lipoproteins as well as between lipoproteins and cells. Many studies have associated PLTP with a variety of lipid metabolic diseases. However, recent studies have indicated that PLTP is highly expressed in the brain of vertebrate and may be related to many central nervous system diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease. Here, we review the data and report the role and mechanisms PLTP in Alzheimer's disease.
