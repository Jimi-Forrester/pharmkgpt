38644857|a|Lippia alba (Mill.) N.E. Brown (Verbenaceae), popularly known as "erva cidreira", is one of the most used plants in Brazilian folk medicine. The species has several chemotypes and its volatile constituents have already been characterized, and present different chemical markers with known pharmacological properties, such as analgesic, sedative and antifungal properties. The objective of this study was to evaluate the anticholinesterase activity (AChE) of the essential oil of three chemotypes of Lippia alba and, by using molecular anchoring, determine the best receptor-ligand interaction energies of the main constituents present in the samples of oil. The essential oils were obtained via hydrodistillation (LA1 and LA2) and steam drag (LA3), and their volatile constituents determined using GC-MS. For the determination of anticholinesterase activity, direct bioautography and colorimetry assays based on Ellman's method were used. Molecular docking was performed using a multiple solution genetic algorithm and Merck molecular force field 94 (MMFF94) as the scoring function. In the main constituents of the oil samples, three chemotypes were identified for L. alba: LA1 is rich in citral, LA2 is rich in carvone and LA3 is rich in linalool. All L. alba chemotypes showed AChE enzyme inhibition with an IC50 of 3.57 mug/mL (LA1), 0.1 mug/mL (LA2) and 4.34 mug/mL (LA3). The molecular docking study complemented the results of the experiment and demonstrated significant interactions between the main constituents of the oils and the amino acid residues of the AChE enzyme. Irrespective of the chemotype, Lippia alba presents biotechnological potential for the discovery of anticholinesterase substances, with the chemotype LA2 (rich in carvone) being the most active.
