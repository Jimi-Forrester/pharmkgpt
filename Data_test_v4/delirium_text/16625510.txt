16625510|a|INTRODUCTION: At present, cholinesterase inhibitors constitute the basis for therapy of Alzheimer's disease (AD); these drugs were rationally introduced given the loss of central cholinergic neurotransmission, even though there are many other systems affected in AD, including glutamatergic pathway. DEVELOPMENT: In addition to the loss of central cholinergic neurotransmission, biochemical evidence suggests glutamatergic dysfunction in AD and thus, therapeutic strategies directed at the glutamatergic system may be useful. These drugs include milacemide, cicloserine and ampakines (positive modulation) and memantine (negative modulation). Lithium seems to be a promising agent in AD, although the mechanism of action is poorly understood. Finally anti-inflammatory agents may be another therapeutic approach to AD. CONCLUSION: In addition to drugs acting on the cholinergic system, a large number of drugs with different mechanism could be used for the treatment and prevention of AD.
