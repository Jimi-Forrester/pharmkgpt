34798498|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) as common late-life dementia is pathologically associated with the irreversible and progressive disorder, misfolding, deposition, and accumulation of the brain proteins. Especially, the formation of fibrous amyloid plaques by aggregation of amyloid-beta peptides is the pathological cause of this neurologic disorder disease. Besides, tau protein isoforms destabilize the microtubule filaments through post-translational modifications and induce nerve cells' death. Amyloid-beta peptides and tau proteins are considered as the critical symptom and reliable molecular biomarkers for the early diagnosis of AD. AD is characterized by impaired thinking proficiencies, cognitive decline, memory loss, and behavioral disability. Since there is no efficacious therapy for AD at present, the development of precise sensing tools for the early diagnosis of this disease is essential and crucial. Aptamer-based biosensors (aptasensors) have acquired utmost importance in the field of AD healthcare, due to excellent sensitivity and specificity, ease-of-use, cost-effectiveness, portability, and rapid assay time. Here, we highlight the recent developments and novel perspectives in the field of aptasensor design to quantitatively monitor the AD biomarkers. Finally, some results are represented to achieve a promising viewpoint for introducing the novel aptasensor test kits in the future.
