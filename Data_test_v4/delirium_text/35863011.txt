35863011|t|Practical management of older adults with cancer: geriatric oncology in Japan.
35863011|a|Japan has the highest proportion of older adults globally, and the average life expectancy of the Japanese population has increased in recent decades. Given that the incidence of cancer increases with age, it is a major health concern for older adults. However, geriatric oncology is a relatively new field and collaboration between oncologists and geriatricians in Japan is limited. Hence, oncologists and other healthcare professionals engaged in cancer care have not been able to adequately understand geriatric care, and information and experience are insufficient for this specific population. Thus, they may struggle with the assessment and management of older adults with cancer. Recently, several Japanese academic societies for cancer have developed practical guidelines and research policy with regard to geriatric research in older adults with cancer, in addition to organizing symposia and workshops focusing especially on geriatric oncology. Furthermore, because the Japan Geriatrics Society established a discipline committee on cancer, close collaboration between oncologists and geriatricians has grown steadily. Geriatric oncology is currently recognized as an important field of cancer care in Japan. The integration of oncology and geriatric care is anticipated in the near future. However, understanding the aspects of geriatric care and meanings of technical jargons used in geriatric oncology is difficult. Accordingly, this article provides an overview of the current knowledge and recent advancements in geriatric oncology. In addition, it outlines the current status and problems of geriatric oncology in Japan.
