35169985|a|KIR2DL2, an inhibitory Killer cell Immunoglobulin-like Receptor (KIR), has been shown to predispose to the development of several herpesvirus-associated diseases by inhibiting the efficiency of Natural Killer (NK) cells against virus-infected cells. The aim of this observational study was to assess the prevalence of KIR2DL2 and Human Herpes Virus 8 (HHV8) in patients affected with classical and endemic Kaposi sarcoma (KS), as well as in controls. Blood samples collected from 17 Caucasian, HIV-negative, immunocompetent patients affected with classical KS (c-KS), 12 African, HIV-negative patients with endemic KS (e-KS), 83 healthy subjects and 26 psoriatic patients were processed for genotypization by PCR for two KIR alleles, such as KIR2DL2 and KIR2DL3 and analyzed for HHV-8 presence. The totality of both c-KS and e-KS patients presented HHV-8 infection, whereas HHV8 was found in 26.9% of psoriatic subjects and 19.3% of healthy subjects. KIR2DL2 was found in the 76.5% of c-KS subjects, while the receptor was found in 41.7% of the e-KS group, 34.6% of psoriatic patients and 43.4% of healthy controls (p < 0.0001). A significantly higher prevalence of KIR2DL2 in c-KS patients than in all the other subjects was also confirmed comparing age-matched groups. Based on these results, the inhibitory KIR2DL2 genotype appears to be a possible cofactor which increases the risk of developing c-KS in HHV8-positive, immunocompetent subjects, while it seems less relevant in e-KS pathogenesis.
