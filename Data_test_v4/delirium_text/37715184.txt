37715184|a|BACKGROUND: The emergence of multidrug-resistant pathogens and the lack of new antimicrobial drugs is a major public health concern that needs urgent and innovative solutions. Endophytic fungi living in unique niches such as in endosymbiosis with plants are increasingly drawing attention as alternative sources of novel and chemically diverse compounds with unique mechanisms of action. METHODS: In the present study, ten endophytic fungi isolated from the medicinal plant, Sclerocarya birrea were screened for bioactivity against a panel of indicator bacteria. Three bioactive endophytic fungi (strains P02PL2, P02MS1, and P02MS2A) were selected and identified through ITS-rDNA sequencing. The whole broth extracts of the three selected isolates were further screened against contemporary drug-resistant bacterial pathogens. This was followed by partial purification by solid phase extraction and GC-MS analysis of bioactive fractions. RESULTS: The bioactive endophytic fungi were identified as Alternaria alternata species (strains P02PL2 and P02MS1) and Nigrospora oryzae (strain P02MS2A). The whole broth extracts from N. oryzae P02MS2A exhibited a MIC of one mug/mL and 16 mug/mL against gram-negative, MDR Pseudomonas 5625574 and gram-positive MRSA 25775 clinical isolates, respectively. After partial purification and GC-MS analysis of whole broth extract from A. alternaria PO2MS1, 2-fluorobenzoic acid heptadecyl was putatively identified as the active compound in fraction C of this extract. This compound was also putatively identified in fraction E of A. alternata P02PL2, fraction B of A. alternata P02MS1 and fraction B of N. oryzae P02MS2A, and interestingly, all these fractions retained activity against the two MDR clinical isolates. CONCLUSION: The putative identification of 2-fluorobenzoic acid heptadecyl compound showing a broad-spectrum of activity, more especially against gram-negative MDR contemporary pathogens is highly encouraging in the initiative at developing novel drugs to combat multi-drug resistance.
