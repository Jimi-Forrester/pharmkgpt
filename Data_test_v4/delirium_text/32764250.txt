32764250|a|(1) Background: Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA) is a painful disease of the joints and spine. Recent reports observed distinct enteric dysbiosis in PsA; intake of probiotic strains is considered to ameliorate enteric dysbiosis. If probiotics are effective in PsA is elusive. (2) Methods: In this pilot open-label study we enrolled 10 PsA patients with low to medium disease activity who received probiotics for 12 weeks. Analysis of faecal zonulin, alpha1-antitrypsin and calprotectin, as well as peripheral immune phenotyping was performed at baseline, after 12 weeks and 12 weeks after termination of probiotic intake. (3) Results: All patients showed increased levels of the enteric permeability marker zonulin which correlated with the frequency of peripheral Th17 cells. Calprotectin, a marker for intestinal inflammation was elevated in 6 out of 10 patients. Probiotic intake resulted in a reduction of disease activity and gut permeability. These effects, however, were not sustained beyond termination of probiotic intake. (4) Conclusions: PsA patients suffer from enhanced enteric permeability and inflammation. Probiotics may ameliorate disease activity in PsA by targeting these alterations.
