38794158|t|Ethnomedicinal Study and Evaluation of the Anxiolytic-like and Diuretic Effects of the Orchid Stanhopea tigrina Bateman ex Lindl-(Orchidaceae).
38794158|a|Stanhopea tigrina Bateman ex Lindl. (Orchidaceae) is an orchid endemic to Mexico, known as "Calavera" or "calaverita", in the Huasteca Potosina (central region of Mexico). This plant species is used for the folk treatment of mental disorders and urological kidney disorders, according to the ethnomedicinal information obtained in this study. Ethanolic extracts of leaves (HE) and pseudobulb (PE) were obtained by microwave-assisted extraction (MAE). Gas Chromatography coupled with Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) was used to carry out the chemical characterization of HE and PE. The pharmacological effects (antioxidant, diuretic, anxiolytic, locomotor, hypnotic, and sedative) of HE and PE were evaluated. The possible mechanism of action of the anxiolytic-like activity induced by HE was assessed using inhibitors of the GABAergic, adrenergic, and serotonergic systems. The possible mechanism of the diuretic action of HE was assessed using prostaglandin inhibitory antagonists and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) blockers. HE at 50 and 100 mg/kg exerted anxiolytic-like activity without inducing hypnosis or sedation. Flumazenil, prazosin, and ketanserin inhibited the anxiolytic-like activity shown by HE, which suggests the participation of GABA, alpha1-adrenergic receptors, and 5-HT2 receptors, respectively. The diuretic effect was reversed by the non-selective NOS inhibitor L-NAME, which caused the reduction in nitric oxide (NO). These results demonstrate that the ethanolic extract of S. tigrina leaves exhibited anxiolytic-like activity and diuretic effects without inducing hypnosis or sedation. This work validates the medicinal uses of this orchid species.
