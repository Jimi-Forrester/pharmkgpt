37895426|t|Aging and Cerebral Glucose Metabolism: 18F-FDG-PET/CT Reveals Distinct Global and Regional Metabolic Changes in Healthy Patients.
37895426|a|Alterations in cerebral glucose metabolism can be indicative of both normal and pathological aging processes. In this retrospective study, we evaluated global and regional neurological glucose metabolism in 73 healthy individuals (mean age: 35.8 +- 13.1 years; 82.5% female) using 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT). This population exhibited a low prevalence of comorbidities associated with cerebrovascular risk factors. We utilized 18F-FDG-PET/CT imaging and quantitative regional analysis to assess cerebral glucose metabolism. A statistically significant negative correlation was found between age and the global standardized uptake value mean (SUVmean) of FDG uptake (p = 0.000795), indicating a decrease in whole-brain glucose metabolism with aging. Furthermore, region-specific analysis identified significant correlations in four cerebral regions, with positive correlations in the basis pontis, cerebellar hemisphere, and cerebellum and a negative correlation in the lateral orbital gyrus. These results were further confirmed via linear regression analysis. Our findings reveal a nuanced understanding of how aging affects glucose metabolism in the brain, providing insight into normal neurology. The study underscores the utility of 18F-FDG-PET/CT as a sensitive tool in monitoring these metabolic changes, highlighting its potential for the early detection of neurological diseases and disorders related to aging.
