39824702|a|BACKGROUND: Older adults with mild behavioral impairment (MBI) are at the higher risk of developing dementia compared to those without MBI, leading to decreased quality of life (QoL). Addressing MBI in older adults provides valuable opportunities to prevent dementia. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine the effects of traditional Thai folk dance combined with a cognitive stimulation program on MBI, QoL, subjective cognitive decline (SCD), and cognitive functioning in older Thai adults. DESIGN: Single-blinded, two-armed, randomized controlled trial, with a three-month follow-up period. SETTING: Outpatient chronic disease clinics at two districts in Suphan Buri province, Thailand. PARTICIPANTS: One-hundred twenty-eight older adults with MBI were randomly assigned to either the experimental (n = 64) and cognitive education control group (n = 64). INTERVENTION: The 14-session, 7-week traditional Thai folk-dance program combined with cognitive stimulation focused on enhanced moderate intensity physical activity and cognitive stimulation engagement to improve MBI of older adults. MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome was MBI assessed using Mild Behavioral Impairment Checklist. Secondary outcomes were QoL, SCD, and cognitive tests of memory and executive functions. RESULTS: Compared to the control group, participants in the experimental group demonstrated significantly reduced MBI (p <.01), improved QoL (p <.01), decreased SCD (p <.01), and enhanced cognitive functioning (p <.01) after the 7-week intervention and at the 12-week follow-up. CONCLUSION: The traditional Thai folk dance combined with cognitive stimulation improved outcomes related to early signs of dementia and enhanced the overall QoL of older adults.
