38564092|a|Autophagy is a crucial process involved in the degradation and recycling of cytoplasmic components which are transported to the lysosomal compartment by autophagosomes. Exosomes are an important means of communication and signaling in both normal and diseased states, and they have a significant role in the transmission and propagation of proteins, especially proteins implicated in neurodegenerative disorders. Autophagy may affect exosomal processing, but whether autophagy controls the release of aggregated beta-amyloid and tau proteins in exosomes of Alzheimer disease (AD) is unclear. Therefore, our study aimed to investigate how modulating autophagy affects the exosomal release of these proteins in animal models of AD. Isolated exosomes from brain tissues of 48 male albino mice were divided into four groups (Negative control, LPS, rapamycin (RAPA), and chloroquine (CQ). LC3 I and LC3 II as well as Abeta and Tau proteins levels were determined. All mice undergone Neuro-behavioral tests (Morris Water maze test, Y-maze test, and Novel Object Recognition). Both LPS and CQ groups showed reduced expression levels of LC3 II and LC3 II/LC3 I ratio. In contrast, RAPA group showed a significant increase in both LC3-II expression and LC3-II/LC3-I ratio. The levels of both Abeta & Tau in exosomes of CQ & LPS groups were higher. While RAPA group showed a significant diminished levels of tau & Abeta proteins. In conclusion, our findings suggest that autophagy alterations in AD can influence the release of Abeta and tau proteins through exosomes, which may impact the spread of misfolded proteins in AD. These results highlight a potential innovative therapeutic approach for combating AD.
