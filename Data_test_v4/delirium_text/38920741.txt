38920741|t|A Review of Immunotherapy in Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer.
38920741|a|Cancer immunotherapy in the form of immune checkpoint inhibitors has led to a dramatic increase in the survival of patients with lung cancer across all stages. Over the past decade, the field has experienced rapid maturation; however, several challenges continue to complicate patient management. This review aims to highlight the data that led to this dramatic shift in practice as well as to focus on key challenges. These include determining the optimal therapy duration, managing frail patients or those with brain metastases, addressing the challenges posed by immune-related adverse events, and defining the various patterns of clinical and radiological responses to immunotherapy.
