36889961|t|Determining the impact of gold nanoparticles on amyloid aggregation with 2D IR spectroscopy.
36889961|a|As nanomaterials become more prevalent in both industry and medicine, it is crucial to fully understand their health risks. One area of concern is the interaction of nanoparticles with proteins, including their ability to modulate the uncontrolled aggregation of amyloid proteins associated with diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and type II diabetes, and potentially extend the lifetime of cytotoxic soluble oligomers. This work demonstrates that two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy and 13C18O isotope labeling can be used to follow the aggregation of human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP) in the presence of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) with single-residue structural resolution. 60 nm AuNPs were found to inhibit hIAPP, tripling the aggregation time. Furthermore, calculating the actual transition dipole strength of the backbone amide I' mode reveals that hIAPP forms a more ordered aggregate structure in the presence of AuNPs. Ultimately, such studies can provide insight into how mechanisms of amyloid aggregation are altered in the presence of nanoparticles, furthering our understanding of protein-nanoparticle interactions.
