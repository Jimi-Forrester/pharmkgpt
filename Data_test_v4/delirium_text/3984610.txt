3984610|t|[Clinico-psychopathologic features and typology of acute paranoid episodes in schizophrenia].
3984610|a|The author observed 50 patients with schizophrenia manifested by a delirious state in the form of acute paranoid. Along with the general characteristics of the psychopathological structure of this syndrome, the schizophrenic patients presented considerable differences both in manifestations of the psychosis itself and in its time-course. On the basis of the qualitative specific features of delirious persecution manifestations and the ratio in the picture of psychosis of the components of acute sensual delirium and interpretative delirium, 3 variants of acute paranoid were identified: paranoid with the predominance of sensual delirium; paranoid with elements of interpretative delirium; and paranoid with a tendency to delirium alteration in the direction of fantasy. The author considers some characteristics of acute paranoids in schizophrenia and the possibility to use the elaborated typology for prognostic purposes.
