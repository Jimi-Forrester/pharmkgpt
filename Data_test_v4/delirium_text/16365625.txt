16365625|a|INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) became a treatable disease about ten years ago when cholinesterase inhibitors (CI) became available. We conducted a national population-based study in France in order to describe patients taking CI in 2001, to compare the diagnostic procedures of AD and the drug prescriptions with the French National guidelines, and to analyze the follow-up procedures of the patients. METHODS: The study was carried out in nine regions of France between December 1st 2000 and February 28th 2001 and included 3510 patients with CI treatment prescribed by the physicians affiliated with the National Social Security Health Care Fund. RESULTS: We found that the diagnostic procedures and the prescriptions were in compliance with the national guidelines with more than 90 percent of patients referred to a specialist, brain imaging in 85 percent and a MMSE scored between 10 and 26 in more than 90 percent. However, patient follow-up was in compliance with the guidelines in only 50 percent of patients. CONCLUSION: Diagnostic procedures of AD and first prescription of CI seem to be adequate in France, but patient follow-up needs to be improved.
