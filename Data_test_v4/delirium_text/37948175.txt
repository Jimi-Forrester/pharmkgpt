37948175|t|The Neuropsychiatric Side of Cerebral Venous Thrombosis: A Case of Delirium and Catatonia.
37948175|a|We report a patient with cerebral venous thrombosis who initially presented with psychosis and who then progressed to delirium and catatonia within a few days. Upon treatment and resolution of the thrombosis, she presented complete remission of the psychiatric disturbances. This case highlights a specific neuropsychiatric presentation of cerebral venous thrombosis involving psychosis, catatonia, and delirium, which, to our best knowledge, has not been reported in the neurological or psychiatric literature. However, it reminds us of mental status and behavioral abnormalities which are not infrequent features of cerebral venous thrombosis. This leads to a discussion regarding the psychopathology, etiology, and pathophysiology of the case.
