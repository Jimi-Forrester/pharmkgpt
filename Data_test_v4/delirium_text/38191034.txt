38191034|t|Nanotechnology in the diagnostic and therapy for Alzheimer's disease.
38191034|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder primarily characterized by beta-amyloid plaque, intraneuronal tangles, significant neuronal loss and cognitive deficit. Treatment in the early stages of the disease is crucial for preventing or perhaps reversing the neurodegeneration in the AD cases. However, none of the current diagnostic procedures are capable of early diagnosis of AD. Further, the available treatments merely provide symptomatic alleviation in AD and do not address the underlying illness. Therefore, there is no permanent cure for AD currently. Better therapeutic outcomes need the optimum drug concentration in the central nervous system (CNS) by traversing blood-brain-barrier (BBB). Nanotechnology offers enormous promise to transform the treatment and diagnostics of neurodegenerative diseases. Nanotechnology based diagnostic tools, drug delivery systems and theragnostic are capable of highly sensitive molecular detection, effective drug targeting and their combination. Significant work has been done in this area over the last decade and prospective results have been obtained in AD therapy. This review explores the various applications of nanotechnology in addressing the varied facets of AD, ranging from early detection to therapeutic interventions. This review also looks at how nanotechnology can help with the development of disease-modifying medicines, such as the delivery of anti-amyloid, anti-tau, cholinesterase inhibitors, antioxidants and hormonal drugs. In conclusion, this paper discusses the role of nanotechnology in the early detection of AD, effective drug targeting to the CNS and theragnostic applications in the management of AD.
