32176105|a|OBJECTIVE: Cognitive enhancers, including cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine, are used to treat dementia, but their effect for reducing post-electroconvulsive therapy (post-ECT) cognitive side effects is unclear. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the effectiveness of cognitive enhancers in the prevention of cognitive side effects due to ECT. METHODS: We identified relevant studies by searching electronic databases (e.g., PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane Library). Only studies published up to October 2019 comparing cognitive enhancer vs placebo for cognitive function after ECT were included. The primary outcome extracted from the studies was cognitive function score. RESULTS: Five studies with 202 patients were included in this study. The cognitive enhancer group (CEG) had a significantly higher cognitive function score. Moreover, sensitivity analysis showed that no individual study had a significant impact on the overall results. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis revealed that cognitive enhancers might improve cognitive function and reduce ECT-induced cognitive side effects. Nevertheless, more high-quality randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with long-term follow-up are still needed to make the final conclusion.
