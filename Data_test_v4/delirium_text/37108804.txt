37108804|t|Determination and Comparison of Soybean Lecithin and Bovine Brain Plasmalogens Effects in Healthy Male Wistar Rats.
37108804|a|The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of soybean lecithin and plasmalogens concentrating on a variety of physiological tests and biochemical analyses in healthy Wistar rats. For six weeks, male Wistar rats were given a standard diet that included plasmalogens or soybean lecithin. We measured anxiety levels, overall exploratory activity, short- and long-term memory, cognitive abilities, and grip strength. Lecithin increased significantly anxiety and enhanced memory and cognitive functions. Plasmalogens significantly improved appetite and increased grip strength. When compared to plasmalogens, lecithin significantly raised HDL levels while lowering LDL levels. The plasmalogens group showed a significant increase in the C16:0DMA/C16:0 ratio, which led us to assume that plasmalogen consumption could increase their synthesis in neural tissue. The study's findings imply that, despite their various modes of action, soy lecithin and plasmalogens may both be significant nutritional components for enhancing cognitive functions.
