32902446|a|Soluble, small amyloid-beta oligomers (AbetaO) are recognized as significant contributors to the pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although drugs for treating AD symptoms have been approved, no therapy targeting amyloid-beta (Abeta) capable of modifying the course of the disease is available. In an effort to develop a label-free method for screening new anti-AD therapeutic agents, we show the use of a surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) active substrate for detecting the interactions between Abeta peptides and spin-labeled fluorine (SLF), a peptide aggregation inhibitor. Changes in the peak positions and intensity ratios of two spectral peaks near 1600cm-1 and 2900cm-1 can be used to monitor the molecular interactions between SLF and Abeta. This study demonstrates the potential of SERS spectroscopy for rapidly screening and identifying new anti-Abeta therapeutic agents.
