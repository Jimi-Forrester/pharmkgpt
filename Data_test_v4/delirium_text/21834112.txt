OBJECTIVE: To evaluate a Hospitalist-run Acute Care for the Elderly (Hospitalist-ACE) service. DESIGN: Quasi-randomized, controlled trial. SETTING: Urban academic medical center. PATIENTS: Medical inpatients age >=70 years. INTERVENTION: Hospitalist-ACE service components: 1) selected hospitalist attendings; 2) daily interdisciplinary rounds; 3) standardized geriatric assessment; 4) clinical focus on mitigating harm and discharge planning; 5) novel inpatient geriatrics curriculum. MEASURES: The primary outcome was recognition of abnormal functional status by the primary medical team. Secondary outcomes included: recognition of abnormal cognitive status and delirium by the primary medical team; use of physical restraints and sleep aids; documentation of code status; hospital charges, length of stay, readmission rates, discharge location, and falls. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-two Hospitalist-ACE patients were compared to 95 usual care patients. Hospitalist-ACE patients had significantly greater recognition of abnormal functional status (65% vs 32%, P < 0.0001), and abnormal cognitive status (57% vs 36%, P = 0.02), and greater use of "Do Not Attempt Resuscitation" orders (39% vs 26%, P = 0.04). There were no differences in use of physical restraints, or sleep aids, falls, or discharge location. Hospitalist-ACE patients and usual care patients had similar mean lengths of stay in days (3.4 +- 2.7 vs 3.1 +- 2.7, P = 0.52), mean charges ($24,617 +- $15,828 vs $21,488 +- $13,407, P = 0.12), and 30-day readmission rates (12% vs 10%, P = 0.50). CONCLUSIONS: A Hospitalist-ACE service may improve care processes without significantly increasing resource consumption. No impact on key clinical outcomes was observed.
