34104887|t|Adaptive Immune Responses Associated with the Central Nervous System Pathology of Gulf War Illness.
34104887|a|Gulf War Illness is a multisymptomatic condition which affects 30% of veterans from the 1991 Gulf War. While there is evidence for a role of peripheral cellular and humoral adaptive immune responses in Gulf War Illness, a potential role of the adaptive immune system in the central nervous system pathology of this condition remains unknown. Furthermore, many of the clinical features of Gulf War Illness resembles those of autoimmune diseases, but the biological processes are likely different as the etiology of Gulf War Illness is linked to hazardous chemical exposures specific to the Gulf War theatre. This review discusses Gulf War chemical-induced maladaptive immune responses and a potential role of cellular and humoral immune responses that may be relevant to the central nervous system symptoms and pathology of Gulf War Illness. The discussion may stimulate investigations into adaptive immunity for developing novel therapies for Gulf War Illness.
