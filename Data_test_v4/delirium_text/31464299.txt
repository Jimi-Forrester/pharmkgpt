31464299|a|Drug-induced delirium is an urgent challenge of modern healthcare, especially in elderly patients, due to the widespread prevalence, associated complications, longer hospitalization period, higher mortality rate. The exact pathogenesis of delirium is unknown, however, a number of studies suggest that it is based on neurotransmitter dysfunction. Thus, drugs that affect the metabolism of these neurotransmitters can lead to the onset of delirium. The Delirium Drug Scale (DDS) and the Anticholinergic Burden scale (ACB) are used to assess the risk of delirium. For patients with an increased risk of delirium, it is recommended to avoid prescribing benzodiazepines, use with caution opiates, dihydropyridines and antagonists of H1-histamine receptors. Non-pharmacological methods are recommended as a first-line treatment of delirium (behavioral approaches, placing the patient in specially equipped delirious rooms, etc.). If non-pharmacological methods have shown to be ineffective or the patient's behavior represents a danger to the life and health of himself and / or others, it is possible to administer antipsychotic drugs.
