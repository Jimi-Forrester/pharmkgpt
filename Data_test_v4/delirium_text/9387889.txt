9387889|a|IGF-I has been shown to enhance neuronal survival and inhibit apoptosis. IGF-I immunoreactivity was examined in the Alzheimer's disease and normal post-mortem human hippocampus and temporal cortex to determine whether IGF-I protein levels are altered in response to neurodegeneration. IGF-I immunoreactivity was induced in a subpopulation of GFAP-immunopositive astroglia in the Alzheimer's disease temporal cortex. These observations raise the possibility that IGF-I has a neuroprotective role in the Alzheimer's disease brain.
