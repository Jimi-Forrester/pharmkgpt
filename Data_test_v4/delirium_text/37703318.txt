37703318|t|Ferroptosis, Pyroptosis, and Cuproptosis in Alzheimer's Disease.
37703318|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common type of dementia, is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive cognitive dysfunction. Epidemiological investigation has demonstrated that, after cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, tumors, and other causes, AD has become a major health issue affecting elderly individuals, with its mortality rate acutely increasing each year. Regulatory cell death is the active and orderly death of genetically determined cells, which is ubiquitous in the development of living organisms and is crucial to the regulation of life homeostasis. With extensive research on regulatory cell death in AD, increasing evidence has revealed that ferroptosis, pyroptosis, and cuproptosis are closely related to the occurrence, development, and prognosis of AD. This paper will review the molecular mechanisms of ferroptosis, pyroptosis, and cuproptosis and their regulatory roles in AD to explore potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of AD.
