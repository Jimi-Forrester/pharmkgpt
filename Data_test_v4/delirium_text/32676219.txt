32676219|t|Association of retinal nerve fiber abnormalities with serum CNTF and cognitive functions in schizophrenia patients.
32676219|a|BACKGROUND: Recent studies have reported reductions in retinal nerve fiber layers (RNFL) in schizophrenia. Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) has shown protective effects on both the neurogenesis and retina. This study aimed at investigating retinal abnormalities and establishing their correlation with serum CNTF and cognitive impairments in schizophrenic Chinese patients. METHODS: In total, 221 patients diagnosed with schizophrenia and 149 healthy controls were enrolled. Serum CNTF and clinical features of patients were investigated. Cognitive functions were evaluated with Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychology Status (RBANS). RNFL thickness and macular thickness (MT) of both eyes were measured with optical coherence tomography (OCT). T-tests and analysis of covariance were used to compare the variables between the patient and control groups, while multiple linear regression analysis was performed to determine the associations of RNFL thickness, CNTF and cognitive impairments. RESULTS: RNFL was found thinner in patients than in healthy controls (right: 88.18 +- 25.84 microm vs.102.13 +- 14.32 microm, p = 0.001; left: 92.84 +- 13.54 microm vs.103.71 +- 11.94 microm, p < 0.001). CNTF was lower in the schizophrenia group (1755.45 +- 375.73 pg/ml vs. 1909.99 +- 368.08 pg/ml, p = 0.001). Decline in RNFL thickness was found correlated with course of illness and serum CNTF in patients (all p < 0.05). Similarly, cognitive functions such as immediate memory and visuospatial functions were also found correlated with decline in RNFL thickness. CONCLUSION: Decline in RNFL thickness was associated with cognitive impairments of schizophrenia and CNFT serum concentration. The possibility of reduction in RNFL thickness as a biomarker for schizophrenia needs to be further examined.
