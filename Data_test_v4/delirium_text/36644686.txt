36644686|t|Managers' and Administrators' Perspectives on Digital Technology Use in Regional Long-Term Care Homes During the COVID-19 Pandemic.
36644686|a|In this paper, we explore managers' and administrators' perspectives on digital technology use for residents during province-wide lockdowns (June-August 2021) during the COVID-19 pandemic in seven regional long-term care homes (LTC) in Niagara, Canada. Fifteen semi-structured interviews were conducted with participants representing operational, financial, and recreational departments where we discussed their needs and factors influencing the use of digital technology during the phases of increased restrictions on visitors and social isolation. Our findings indicate extensive use of cellular devices including smartphones, however additional iPads were needed to meet the ever-rising demand for virtual connections. Almost all participants revealed supportive leadership, redeployed staff, and community donations as main facilitators for technology use. Barriers related to managing varying elderly cognitive capacities and technical issues affected technology use. Based on our findings, we conclude that financial commitment and community support are integral for future-proofing LTC homes with technological innovations.
