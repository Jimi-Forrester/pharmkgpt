37196396|a|BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: While positive airway pressure (PAP) is an efficacious intervention for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) in children with Down syndrome (DS), implementation and consistent use can be difficult. Caregiver perspectives and experiences using PAP are described with the aim of informing clinical practice. METHODS: Qualitative semi-structured phone interviews were conducted with 40 caregivers (i.e., mothers) of children with DS and OSAS treated with PAP for at least 6 months. Content analysis was used to identify themes associated with adherence and non-adherence. RESULTS: Respondents indicated variability in caregiver experience with the adoption of PAP and observed benefits of PAP. Varied experiences were attributed to several themes including accessing supplies, interactions with the medical team and equipment company, and patients' unique needs and behaviors, including the child's willingness and ability to adapt to PAP, sensory sensitivities, keeping the mask on all night, and differences in daytime behavior. Many families reported that desensitization with a reward system and trust within the caregiver-patient relationship were helpful. Caregiver suggestions for improving PAP adherence for families of children with DS included improving communication with the medical team and medical equipment company, emphasizing patience, using visual supports, and social support and education for extended family. CONCLUSIONS: Although family experiences varied, several actionable strategies by both the medical team and families emerged for improving the experience of and adherence to PAP in children with DS.
