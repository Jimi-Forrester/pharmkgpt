36726408|t|Internal m7G methylation: A novel epitranscriptomic contributor in brain development and diseases.
36726408|a|In recent years, N7-methylguanosine (m7G) methylation, originally considered as messenger RNA (mRNA) 5' caps modifications, has been identified at defined internal positions within multiple types of RNAs, including transfer RNAs, ribosomal RNAs, miRNA, and mRNAs. Scientists have put substantial efforts to discover m7G methyltransferases and methylated sites in RNAs to unveil the essential roles of m7G modifications in the regulation of gene expression and determine the association of m7G dysregulation in various diseases, including neurological disorders. Here, we review recent findings regarding the distribution, abundance, biogenesis, modifiers, and functions of m7G modifications. We also provide an up-to-date summary of m7G detection and profile mapping techniques, databases for validated and predicted m7G RNA sites, and web servers for m7G methylation prediction. Furthermore, we discuss the pathological roles of METTL1/WDR-driven m7G methylation in neurological disorders. Last, we outline a roadmap for future directions and trends of m7G modification research, particularly in the central nervous system.
