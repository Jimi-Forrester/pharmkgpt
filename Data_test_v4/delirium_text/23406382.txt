23406382|a|Deposition of amyloid beta (Abeta) in the brain is a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. There are two major isoforms of Abeta: the 42-residue Abeta42 and the 40-residue Abeta40. The only difference between Abeta42 and Abeta40 is that Abeta42 has two extra residues at the C-terminus. The amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's brains consist of mostly Abeta42 and some plaques contain only Abeta42, even though Abeta40 concentration is several-fold more than Abeta42. Using electron paramagnetic resonance, we studied the formation of amyloid fibrils using a mixture of Abeta42 and Abeta40 in vitro. We show that Abeta42 and Abeta40 form mixed fibrils in an interlaced manner, although Abeta40 is not as efficient as Abeta42 in terms of being incorporated into Abeta42 fibrils. Our results suggest that both Abeta42 and Abeta40 would be present in amyloid plaques if in vivo aggregation of Abeta were similar to the in vitro process. Therefore, there must be some mechanisms that lead to the preferential deposition of Abeta42 at the extracellular space. Identifying such mechanisms may open new avenues for therapeutic interventions to treat Alzheimer's disease.
