38166634|a|BACKGROUND: Stellate ganglion block (SGB) has been shown to reduce perioperative complications in various surgeries. Because laparoscopic techniques and instruments have advanced during the past two decades, laparoscopic liver resection is being increasingly adopted worldwide. Lesser blood loss, fewer postoperative complications, and shorter postoperative hospital stays are the advantages of laparoscopic liver resection, as compared to conventional open surgery. There is an urgent need for an effective intervention to reduce perioperative complications and accelerate postoperative recovery. This study investigated the effect of ultrasound-guided SGB on enhanced recovery after laparoscopic partial hepatectomy. METHODS: We compared patients who received SGB with 0.5% ropivacaine (group S) with those who received SGB with 0.9% saline (group N). A total of 58 patients with partial hepatectomy were enrolled (30 S) and (28 N). Before induction of anesthesia, SGB was performed with 0.5% ropivacaine in group S and 0.9% saline in group N. MAIN OUTCOME: Comparison of serum inflammatory cytokines concentration at each time point. RESULTS: Main outcome: When comparing IL-6 and IL-10 concentrations among groups, group S showed less variation over time compared to group N. For comparison between groups, the serum IL-6 concentration in group S was lower than that in group N at 6 and 24 h after operation (P < 0.01), and there was a significant linear relationship between serum IL-6 concentration at 24 h after operation and hospitalization situation. CONCLUSIONS: Ultrasound-guided SGB can stabilize perioperative inflammatory cytokines plays a positive role in the enhanced recovery of patients after laparoscopic partial hepatectomy. The serum IL-6 level within 24 h after surgery may be used as a predictor of hospitalization. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was registered at the ClinicalTrials.gov (Registration date: 13/09/2021; Trial ID: NCT05042583).
