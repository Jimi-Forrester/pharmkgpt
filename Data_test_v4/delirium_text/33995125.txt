33995125|a|Preeclampsia is a clinical syndrome characterized by multiple-organ dysfunction, such as maternal hypertension and proteinuria, after 20 weeks of gestation. It is a common cause of fetal growth restriction, fetal malformation, and maternal death. At present, termination of pregnancy is the only way to prevent the development of the disease. Non-coding RNAs, including microRNAs, long non-coding RNAs, and circular RNAs, are involved in important pathological and physiological functions in life cycle activities including ontogeny, reproduction, apoptosis, and cell reprogramming, and are closely associated with human diseases. Accumulating evidence suggests that non-coding RNAs are involved in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia through regulation of various physiological functions. In this review, we discuss the current evidence of the pathogenesis of preeclampsia, introduce the types and biological functions of non-coding RNA, and summarize the roles of non-coding RNA in the pathophysiological development of preeclampsia from the perspectives of oxidative stress, hypoxia, angiogenesis, decidualization, trophoblast invasion and proliferation, immune regulation, and inflammation. Finally, we briefly discuss the potential clinical application and future prospects of non-coding RNA as a biomarker for the diagnosis of preeclampsia.
