18448781|t|Too much too soon? Refeeding syndrome as an iatrogenic cause of delirium.
18448781|a|BACKGROUND: Delirium is a significant and costly complication of medical hospitalization, and it has been shown to be a significant predictor of morbidity and mortality. It is often noted as a symptom in reported cases of refeeding syndrome, which is a potentially fatal complication in the treatment of patients suffering from malnutrition. OBJECTIVE: A case of delirium due to refeeding syndrome in a 61-year-old man is presented to help clinicians recognize this entity. The pathophysiology of refeeding syndrome and its possible role as an as-yet poorly-identified iatrogenic cause of delirium are discussed. METHOD: A diagnosis of delirium due to refeeding syndrome was made, and a nutrition consult was requested. Per nutrition recommendations, the patient was placed on a restricted calorie regimen, with aggressive supplementation of magnesium and phosphate. RESULTS: With his new dietary regimen, his mental status gradually improved, with complete resolution of his delirium by the 8th hospital day. He suffered no further episodes of confusion or disorientation. CONCLUSION: The relationship between refeeding syndrome and delirium may be of particular significance in the elderly, since malnutrition, medical hospitalization, and delirium are prevalent phenomena in this population.
