38377056|t|Design, Synthesis, and Characterization of Novel Styryl Dyes as Fluorescent Probes for Tau Aggregate Detection in Vitro and in Cells.
38377056|a|A series of novel styryl dye derivatives incorporating indolium and quinolinium core structures were successfully synthesized to explore their interacting and binding capabilities with tau aggregates in vitro and in cells. The synthesized dyes exhibited enhanced fluorescence emission in viscous environments due to the rotatable bond confinement in the core structure. Dye 4, containing a quinolinium moeity and featuring two cationic sites, demonstrated a 28-fold increase in fluorescence emission upon binding to tau aggregates. This dye could also stain tau aggregates in living cells, confirmed by cell imaging using confocal fluorescence microscopy. A molecular docking study was conducted to provide additional visualization and support for binding interactions. This work offers novel and non-cytotoxic fluorescent probes with desirable photophysical properties, which could potentially be used for studying tau aggregates in living cells, prompting further development of new fluorescent probes for early Alzheimer's disease detection.
