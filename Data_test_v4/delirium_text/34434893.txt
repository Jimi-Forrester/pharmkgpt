34434893|t|Oleic Acid and Insulin as Key Characteristics of T2D Promote Colorectal Cancer Deterioration in Xenograft Mice Revealed by Functional Metabolomics.
34434893|a|Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers with high mortality worldwide. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D), known as a risk factor of CRC, can promote the deterioration of CRC, but the underlying mechanism is elusive. In this study, we aimed to reveal the relationship between CRC and T2D from the perspective of small-molecule metabolism. First, a list of common dysregulated metabolites in CRC and T2D was obtained by retrieving existing metabolomics publications. Among these metabolites, oleic acid (OA) was found to be able to promote the proliferation and migration of colon carcinoma cell HCT116. Further experiments proved that insulin could significantly strengthen this promotion and showed a synergistic effect with OA. Mechanism study found that OA and insulin acted synergistically through the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2/c-Myc/cyclin D1 pathway. In addition, the combination of ERK1/2 inhibitor SCH772984 and cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)4/6 inhibitor palbociclib showed a remarkable inhibitory effect on tumor growth in vivo. Taken together, the current study found that OA plays an important role in CRC development by using a functional metabolomics approach. More importantly, insulin and OA were confirmed to synergistically promote the deterioration of CRC in vitro and in vivo via ERK1/2/c-Myc/cyclin D1 pathway. Our findings may shed light on CRC treatment among the T2D population.
