However, despite being common, no definite consensus recommendations exist for the management of depression in AD. OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) on the alleviation of depressive symptoms in patients with AD. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and PsychINFO were electronically searched from inception until October 2022. Response to therapy and mean depression scores between the treatment (or before) and placebo (or after) groups were the primary outcomes. For depression scores, the standard mean deviation and accompanying 95% confidence interval were determined. The risk of bias was determined using the funnel plot, trim and fill, Egger's and Begg's analyses. RESULTS: SSRIs attenuated depressive symptoms in patients with AD (0.905 SMD, 95%CI, 0.689 to 1.121, p < 0.000). At individual SSRI level, escitalopram, paroxetine, and sertraline significantly alleviated depressive symptoms in AD patients (0.813 SMD, 95%CI, 0.207 to 1.419, p = 0.009, 1.244 SMD, 95%CI, 0.939 to 1.548, p < 0.000, and 0.818 SMD, 95%CI, 0.274 to 1.362, p < 0.000). The funnel plot, trim and fill, Begg's test (p = 0.052), and Egger's test (p = 0.148), showed no significant risk of publication bias. CONCLUSION: Our meta-analysis supports the use of SSRIs for the alleviation of depression in patients with AD. However, we recommend larger randomized clinical trials that would compare the efficacy of different SSRIs in AD patients with depression.
