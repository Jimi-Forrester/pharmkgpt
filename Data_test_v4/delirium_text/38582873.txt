38582873|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is recognized as the predominant cause of dementia, and neuroimmune processes play a pivotal role in its pathological progression. The involvement of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in AD has attracted widespread attention. Herein, transcriptomic analysis of 262 unique samples extracted from five hippocampal-entorhinal system subfields of individuals with AD pathology and without AD pathology revealed distinctive lncRNA expression profiles. Through differential expression and coexpression analyses, we identified 16 pivotal lncRNAs. Notably, RN7SL1 knockdown significantly modulated microglial responses upon oligomeric amyloid-beta stimulation, resulting in a considerable decrease in proinflammatory cytokine production and subsequent neuronal damage. These findings highlight RN7SL1 as an essential neuroimmune-related lncRNA that could serve as a prospective target for AD diagnosis and treatment.
