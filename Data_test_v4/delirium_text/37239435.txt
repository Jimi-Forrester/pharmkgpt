37239435|t|Crosstalk between miRNAs and DNA Methylation in Cancer.
37239435|a|miRNAs are some of the most well-characterized regulators of gene expression. Integral to several physiological processes, their aberrant expression often drives the pathogenesis of both benign and malignant diseases. Similarly, DNA methylation represents an epigenetic modification influencing transcription and playing a critical role in silencing numerous genes. The silencing of tumor suppressor genes through DNA methylation has been reported in many types of cancer and is associated with tumor development and progression. A growing body of literature has described the crosstalk between DNA methylation and miRNAs as an additional layer in the regulation of gene expression. Methylation in miRNA promoter regions inhibits its transcription, while miRNAs can target transcripts and subsequently regulate the proteins responsible for DNA methylation. Such relationships between miRNA and DNA methylation serve an important regulatory role in several tumor types and highlight a novel avenue for potential therapeutic targets. In this review, we discuss the crosstalk between DNA methylation and miRNA expression in the pathogenesis of cancer and describe how miRNAs influence DNA methylation and, conversely, how methylation impacts the expression of miRNAs. Finally, we address how these epigenetic modifications may be leveraged as biomarkers in cancer.
