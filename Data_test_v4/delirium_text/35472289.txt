35472289|t|Notch signalling in healthy and diseased vasculature.
35472289|a|Notch signalling is an evolutionarily highly conserved signalling mechanism governing differentiation and regulating homeostasis in many tissues. In this review, we discuss recent advances in our understanding of the roles that Notch signalling plays in the vasculature. We describe how Notch signalling regulates different steps during the genesis and remodelling of blood vessels (vasculogenesis and angiogenesis), including critical roles in assigning arterial and venous identities to the emerging blood vessels and regulation of their branching. We then proceed to discuss how experimental perturbation of Notch signalling in the vasculature later in development affects vascular homeostasis. In this review, we also describe how dysregulated Notch signalling, as a consequence of direct mutations of genes in the Notch pathway or aberrant Notch signalling output, contributes to various types of vascular disease, including CADASIL, Snedden syndrome and pulmonary arterial hypertension. Finally, we point out some of the current knowledge gaps and identify remaining challenges in understanding the role of Notch in the vasculature, which need to be addressed to pave the way for Notch-based therapies to cure or ameliorate vascular disease.
