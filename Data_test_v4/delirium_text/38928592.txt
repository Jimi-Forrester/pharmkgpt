38928592|a|The endocannabinoid system has been linked to various physiological and pathological processes, because it plays a neuromodulator role in the central nervous system. In this sense, cannabinoids have been used off-label for neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHA), as well as in Alzheimer's disease (AD), a more prevalent neurodegenerative disease. Thus, this study aims, through a comprehensive literature review, to arrive at a better understanding of the impact of cannabinoids in the therapeutic treatment of patients with ASD, ADHD, and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Overall, cannabis products rich in CBD displayed a higher therapeutic potential for ASD children, while cannabis products rich in THC have been tested more for AD therapy. For ADHD, the clinical studies are incipient and inconclusive, but promising. In general, the main limitations of the clinical studies are the lack of standardization of the cannabis-based products consumed by the participants, a lack of scientific rigor, and the small number of participants.
