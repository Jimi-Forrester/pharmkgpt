17101223|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is clinically marked at the onset, by memory disturbances affecting explicit memory. Emotional explicit memory is enhanced in normal subjects and remained less affected at the beginning of AD. The kinase p70S6k participates in the control of protein translation and seems also implicated in the process of synaptic plasticity and the formation of memory at the molecular level. In a previous study, we have shown that peripheral p70S6k level is correlated with the decline of cognitive and memory functions in patients with AD. The goal of the present study was to analyse emotional and neutral explicit memory in AD patients and to evaluate the levels of active p70S6k in lymphocytes by western blots. The results reveal that the difference between emotional and neutral memories are correlated with the levels of peripheral p70S6k in patients with AD, as well as with the global cognitive scores assessed by the Mini Mental Status Examination. The decline of emotional memory in AD patients is reflected by the decrease of p70S6k levels.
