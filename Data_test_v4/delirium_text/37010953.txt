37010953|t|Perioperative Management and Outcomes in Patients With Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Retrospective Cohort Study.
37010953|a|BACKGROUND: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurocognitive disorder characterized by impairments in communication and socialization. There are little data comparing the differences in perioperative outcomes in children with and without ASD. We hypothesized that children with ASD would have higher postoperative pain scores than those without ASD. METHODS: Pediatric patients undergoing ambulatory tonsillectomy/adenoidectomy, ophthalmological surgery, general surgery, and urologic procedures between 2016 and 2021 were included in this retrospective cohort study. ASD patients, defined by International Classification of Diseases-9/10 codes, were compared to controls utilizing inverse probability of treatment weighting based on surgical category/duration, age, sex, race and ethnicity, anesthetizing location, American Society of Anesthesiology physical status, intraoperative opioid dose, and intraoperative dexmedetomidine dose. The primary outcome was the maximum postanesthesia care unit (PACU) pain score, and secondary outcomes included premedication administration, behavior at induction, PACU opioid administration, postoperative vomiting, emergence delirium, and PACU length of stay. RESULTS: Three hundred thirty-five children with ASD and 11,551 non-ASD controls were included. Maximum PACU pain scores in the ASD group were not significantly higher than controls (median, 5; interquartile range [IQR], 0-8; ASD versus median, 5; IQR, 0-8 controls; median difference [95% confidence interval {CI}] of 0 [-1.1 to 1.1]; P = .66). There was no significant difference in the use of premedication (96% ASD versus 95% controls; odds ratio [OR], 1.5; [95% CI, 0.9-2.7]; P = .12), but the ASD cohort had significantly higher odds of receiving an intranasal premedication (4.2% ASD versus 1.2% controls; OR, 3.5 [95% CI, 1.8-6.8]; P < .001) and received ketamine significantly more frequently (0.3% ASD versus <0.1% controls; P < .001). Children with ASD were more likely to have parental (4.9% ASD versus 1.0% controls; OR, 5 [95% CI, 2.1-12]; P < .001) and child life specialist (1.3% ASD versus 0.1% controls; OR, 9.9 [95% CI, 2.3-43]; P < .001) presence at induction, but were more likely to have a difficult induction (11% ASD versus 3.4% controls; OR, 3.42 [95% CI, 1.7-6.7]; P < .001). There were no significant differences in postoperative opioid administration, emergence delirium, vomiting, or PACU length of stay between cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: We found no difference in maximum PACU pain scores in children with ASD compared to a similarly weighted cohort without ASD. Children with ASD had higher odds of a difficult induction despite similar rates of premedication administration, and significantly higher parental and child life specialist presence at induction. These findings highlight the need for future research to develop evidence-based interventions to optimize the perioperative care of this population.
