18632002|a|Memories are the gifts from friends and family that stay with us forever, unless a person develops Alzheimer's disease. Leon J. Thal left many, many memories, along with his desire to create a world where people did not lose them to the ravages of dementing illnesses. Working from the bench to the clinic, he was an incomparable leader, scientist, and educator to whom many, including myself, owe much. The present description of a clinical, genetic, and pathologic study of the oldest old contains much of Leon's influence. With data from >950 subjects, a brain repository, and our collection of DNA, the investigators of the 90+ Study are receptive to collaborations. Through our collective efforts, we will continue the scientific work that Leon so strongly supported.
