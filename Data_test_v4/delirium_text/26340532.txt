26340532|t|Modulation of Amyloid-beta Fibrils into Mature Microrod-Shaped Structure by Histidine Functionalized Water-Soluble Perylene Diimide.
26340532|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with different types of amyloid peptide aggregates including senile plaques, fibrils, protofibrils, and oligomers. Due to these difficulties, a powerful strategy is needed for the disaggregation of amyloid aggregates by modulating their self-aggregation behavior. Herein, we report a unique approach toward transforming the aggregated amyloidogenic peptides using an amino acid functionalized perylene diimide as a molecular modulator, which is a different nondestructive approach as compared to inhibiting the aggregation of peptides. The histidine functionalized perylenediimide (PDI-HIS) molecule could coassemble with amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides via hydrogen bonding that leads to the enhancement in the pi-pi interactions between Abeta and PDI-HIS moieties. The Thioflavin T (ThT) assay and various spectroscopic and microscopic techniques establish that the PDI-HIS molecules accelerate the Abeta1-40 and the amyloid aggregates in CSF into micro size coassembled structures. These results give rise to a new and unique complementary approach for modulating the biological effects of the aggregates in amyloidogenic peptides.
