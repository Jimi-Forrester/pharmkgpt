16406282|t|Bioinformatic identification and characterization of new members of short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase superfamily.
16406282|a|With about 60 genes known in the human genome, short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases (SDRs) form a large gene family with important implications for medicine. They are known to be involved in carcinogenesis (e.g. breast and prostate cancer) as well as in metabolic and degenerative defects such as the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, osteoporosis and diabetes. Uncharacterized SDRs are thus potential candidates for many monogenic and multifactorial human diseases. The identification and functional analysis of such SDR enzymes is therefore the primary goal of the study leading to new targets for drug development. In all taxa (bacteria, plants, insects, vertebrates), members of SDR superfamily are known. Up to now, there are several thousand members annotated many of which have not been characterized biochemically with regard to enzymatic activity, substrate specificity, or subcellular localization. We bioinformatically identified 250 vertebrate candidate genes belonging to the SDR superfamily using the BioNetWorks software SDR finder. The number was reduced to 95 after continuative analysis, including manual SDR motif verification and focus on human, rat and murine enzymes. Here, we present several new mammalian SDRs that were clustered into several enzymatically different groups by detailed phylogenetic analyses. Furthermore, characteristic mRNA expression patterns were identified for some of these genes by a recently developed in silico Northern blot method supporting their putative functions in retinoid, steroid, sugar and other metabolic pathways.
