34648247|a|Periodontitis is an inflammatory disease induced by local infection in tooth-supporting tissue. Periodontitis is associated with systemic bone diseases, but little is known about the mechanism of the causal effect of periodontitis on systemic bone resorption. Bacteria-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) act as natural carriers of virulence factors that are responsible for systemic inflammation. In this study, we investigated the role of EVs derived from Filifactor alocis, a Gram-positive, anaerobic periodontal pathogen, in systemic bone loss and osteoclast differentiation. F. alocis EVs accumulated in the long bones of mice after intraperitoneal administration. These EVs induced proinflammatory cytokines, osteoclastogenesis, and bone resorption via Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2). The phase separation of F. alocis EVs showed that amphiphilic molecules were responsible for the induced bone resorption and osteoclastogenesis. The osteoclastogenic effects of F. alocis EVs were reduced by lipoprotein lipase. Proteomic analysis of the amphiphilic molecules identified seven lipoproteins. Our results indicate that lipoprotein-like molecules in F. alocis EVs may contribute to systemic bone loss via TLR2.
