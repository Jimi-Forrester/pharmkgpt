32147681|t|A curable pseudo-dementia related to an atypical presentation of giant cell arteritis.
32147681|a|A 70-year-old patient was admitted with rapidly progressive cognitive decline associated with limitations in activities of daily living, weight loss and cerebellar ataxia. The diagnosis of giant cell arteritis (GCA) with vascular involvement was made, based on the presence of a metabolically active vasculitis of the brachiocephalic trunk on 18FDG-PET imaging. Temporal artery biopsy also revealed pan-arteritis. A progressive regression of cognitive disorders occurred under corticosteroid treatment and immunosuppressive therapy. Previously published case reports concerning this atypical presentation of GCA are scarce. They suggest that numerous cognitive symptoms, such as impairment of short-term memory, disorientation, delirium, impaired attention or visual hallucinations might be related to GCA. Thus, this diagnosis should be considered as a curable cause of unexplained cognitive impairment associated with weight loss and systemic inflammation.
