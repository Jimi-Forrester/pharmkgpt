35491128|a|Cushing's disease causes numerous metabolic disorders, cognitive decline, and sarcopenia, leading to deterioration of the general health in older individuals. Cushing's disease can be treated with transsphenoidal surgery, but thus far, surgery has often been avoided in older patients. We herein report an older woman with Cushing's disease whose cognitive impairment and sarcopenia improved after transsphenoidal surgery. Although cognitive impairment and sarcopenia in most older patients show resistance to treatment, our case indicates that normalization of the cortisol level by transsphenoidal surgery can be effective in improving the cognitive impairment and muscle mass loss caused by Cushing's disease.
