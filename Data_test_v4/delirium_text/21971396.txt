21971396|t|Delirium in the postanaesthesia period.
21971396|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Delirium is an acute, potentially life-threatening organ dysfunction with an incidence reported to range from 10-70% after surgery. Postoperative delirium was found to be associated with persisting cognitive deficits, increased physical dependence and institutionalization, and increased mortality. It is a condition particularly relevant to patients with increasing age. RECENT FINDINGS: This study summarizes recent works of the past 2 years, giving a brief overview as well as background information with regard to risk factors, impact on outcome parameters, mechanisms of pathophysiology, current use of hospital medication, and prevention and treatment strategies of postoperative delirium. SUMMARY: Delirium may have an impact on patients' outcomes beyond their stay in hospital, depending on preoperative comorbidities. Delirium can be devastating for activity of daily living, cognitive performance and survival. Predisposing factors should be recognized preoperatively; precipitating factors such as preoperative fasting, deep sedation and choice of psychotropic drugs, including sedatives, should be reconsidered. Regular structured delirium screening is the precondition for early detection and treatment. Treatment options include cognitive training programmes, anti-inflammatory measures and antipsychotic drugs.
