1891063|a|Amyloid P (AP) component is present in all types of systemic amyloid deposits. Recently, it has been shown to be also present in cerebral amyloid lesions of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, we used immunocytochemical methods to extend these findings at the electron microscope level and characterize the spectrum of AP immunoreactivity in neurofibrillary pathology (NFP) of AD and other neurodegenerative disorders including Down's syndrome (DS), Creutzfeldt-Jakob, Parkinson's, Pick's and diffuse Lewy body diseases and progressive supranuclear palsy. In AD and DS, AP immunoreaction product was evident in all the classical amyloid lesions and NFP in a large sample of all cortical areas examined. The distribution and relative intensity of immunostaining was similar to that of thioflavin S staining in serial sections. In many cases, however, plaques and vessels stained by anti-AP serum were not apparent with thioflavin S. Serial sections immunostained with antiserum to amyloid A, C-reactive protein or to other proteins involved in systemic amyloidoses and the acute phase response showed no evidence of staining in any of the cerebral lesions. Electron microscopy confirmed that AP immunoreactivity was associated with the abnormal filaments characteristic of NFP as well as amyloid fibrils found in plaques and vessels showing congophilic amyloid angiopathy. Plaques of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, Pick bodies of Pick's disease, tangles and Lewy bodies in Parkinson's disease and a subpopulation of Lewy bodies in the diffuse Lewy body disease coexistent with AD were also stained. With the exception of vessels in two of the five cases, AP was not detected in age-matched controls. Our observations indicate AP to be a consistent feature of cerebral NFP and amyloid deposits.
