29479559|t|Thymoma-associated panencephalitis: a newly emerging paraneoplastic neurologic syndrome.
29479559|a|Recently, a few case reports of thymoma-associated panencephalitis (TAPE) have brought to light a disease entity that has not been fully characterized. Literature review of TAPE reveals an array of associated neuronal antibodies, with varied responses to thymomectomy with or without immunotherapy. This report describes a case of TAPE and proposes that the GABAA receptor antibody is a potential target antigen driving the immune process in this disease entity. Treatment-wise, early thymomectomy consistently improves the overall course of disease. Further study of such cases will be critical in clarifying the mechanisms of disease, improving early diagnosis, and developing targeted approaches to treatment.
