20675882|a|Cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine are widely used for the treatment of Alzheimer disease (AD) and other non-AD dementia worldwide. Since 2000, large scale prospective random control studies using meta-analysis have provided clinical evidence for the use of these drugs in AD and non-AD dementia.
