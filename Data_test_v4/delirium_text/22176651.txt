22176651|a|With the progressive aging of the population surgical candidates have more comorbidities resulting in a higher risk to develop postoperative complications. One of the most frequent postoperative complications in the elderly is acute confusional state or delirium, which may have devastating consequences: higher mortality, and risk of medical complications during admission and, a higher risk of functional decline, institutionalization, and cognitive impairment at discharge. For all these reasons and with the aim of optimising surgical procedures, it is essential to identify patients at risk of delirium in order to take appropriate preventive action and provide early treatment. In the present article we review the current evidence on the management of postoperative delirium in the elderly.
