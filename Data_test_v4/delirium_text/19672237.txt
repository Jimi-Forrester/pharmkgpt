19672237|a|Twenty-five patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) in moderate-severe and severe stages received galantamine in dosage 8 mg daily during the 1st month with the following increasing to 16 mg daily. Six patients received 24 mg per day from the 3rd month. The total duration of therapy was 26 weeks. 15 patients received in addition the antipsychotic therapy. Reminyl had a positive effect on cognitive functions and psychotic symptoms of dementia, in particular delusions, aggression and irritability, apathy, aberrant motor behavior, eating and sleep disorders. The therapeutic reduction of these disorders resulted in the distinct reduction of physical and mental burden on the caregivers. The therapeutic effects of reminyl and its good tolerability allow to recommend this drug for treatment of severe stages of AD.
