17378352|t|[The differential diagnosis of cognitive disorders in general practice: dementia and delirium].
17378352|a|Cognitive deficits are frequently encountered in primary care settings, in particular in the elderly. Screening of these deficits is recommended and aims at identifying subjects who are likely to benefit from treatment. In the event of either positive screening or cognitive complaint, further somatic, cognitive, psychopathological, and functional assessment should be performed and possible consequences on family caregivers sought. Laboratory tests and neuro-imaging are often necessary. This multi-dimensional assessment may require the expertise of a memory clinic to distinguish normal aging, mild cognitive impairment, and to identify the different organic and functional aetiologies of the dementia syndrome and delirium.
