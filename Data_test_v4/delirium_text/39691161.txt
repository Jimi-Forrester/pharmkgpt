39691161|a|Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder marked by cognitive decline, for which effective treatments remain elusive due to complex pathogenesis. Recent advances in neuroimaging, gene therapy, and gut microbiota research offer new insights and potential intervention strategies. Neuroimaging enables early detection and staging of AD through visualization of biomarkers, aiding diagnosis and tracking of disease progression. Gene therapy presents a promising approach for modifying AD-related genetic expressions, targeting amyloid and tau pathology, and potentially repairing neuronal damage. Furthermore, emerging evidence suggests that the gut microbiota influences AD pathology through the gut-brain axis, impacting inflammation, immune response, and amyloid metabolism. However, each of these technologies faces significant challenges, including concerns about safety, efficacy, and ethical considerations. This article reviews the applications, advantages, and limitations of neuroimaging, gene therapy, and gut microbiota research in AD, with a particular focus on their combined potential for early diagnosis, mechanistic insights, and therapeutic interventions. We propose an integrated approach that leverages these tools to provide a multi-dimensional framework for advancing AD diagnosis, treatment, and prevention.
