36093711|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative illness majorly affecting the population between the ages of 55 to 65 years. Progressive dopaminergic neuronal loss and the collective assemblage of misfolded alpha-synuclein in the substantia nigra, remain notable neuro-pathological hallmarks of the disease. Multitudes of mechanistic pathways have been proposed in attempts to unravel the pathogenesis of PD but still, it remains elusive. The convergence of PD pathology is found in organelle dysfunction where mitochondria remain a major contributor. Mitochondrial processes like bioenergetics, mitochondrial dynamics, and mitophagy are under strict regulation by the mitochondrial genome and nuclear genome. These processes aggravate neurodegenerative activities upon alteration through neuroinflammation, oxidative damage, apoptosis, and proteostatic stress. Therefore, the mitochondria have grabbed a central position in the patho-mechanistic exploration of neurodegenerative diseases like PD. The management of PD remains a challenge to physicians to date, due to the variable therapeutic response of patients and the limitation of conventional chemical agents which only offer symptomatic relief with minimal to no disease-modifying effect. This review describes the patho-mechanistic pathways involved in PD not only limited to protein dyshomeostasis and oxidative stress, but explicit attention has been drawn to exploring mechanisms like organelle dysfunction, primarily mitochondria and mitochondrial genome influence, while delineating the newer exploratory targets such as GBA1, GLP, LRRK2, and miRNAs and therapeutic agents targeting them.
