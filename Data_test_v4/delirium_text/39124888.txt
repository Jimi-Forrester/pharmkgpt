39124888|t|A Comprehensive Review of Nanoparticles: From Classification to Application and Toxicity.
39124888|a|Nanoparticles are structures that possess unique properties with high surface area-to-volume ratio. Their small size, up to 100 nm, and potential for surface modifications have enabled their use in a wide range of applications. Various factors influence the properties and applications of NPs, including the synthesis method and physical attributes such as size and shape. Additionally, the materials used in the synthesis of NPs are primary determinants of their application. Based on the chosen material, NPs are generally classified into three categories: organic, inorganic, and carbon-based. These categories include a variety of materials, such as proteins, polymers, metal ions, lipids and derivatives, magnetic minerals, and so on. Each material possesses unique attributes that influence the activity and application of the NPs. Consequently, certain NPs are typically used in particular areas because they possess higher efficiency along with tenable toxicity. Therefore, the classification and the base material in the NP synthesis hold significant importance in both NP research and application. In this paper, we discuss these classifications, exemplify most of the major materials, and categorize them according to their preferred area of application. This review provides an overall review of the materials, including their application, and toxicity.
