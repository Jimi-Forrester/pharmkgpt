30536416|a|Natural disasters impact people of every age in the communities where they occur, with older adults being a vulnerable subset of the population. Most disaster shelter volunteer nurses are experienced in addressing common health needs of older adult clients such as diabetes, hypertension, and pulmonary disease. These nurses also have the requisite training to respond to more acute medical events, including the symptoms of a heart attack or stroke. They provide care and comfort to those suffering from the distress, anxiety, and fear caused by disasters. However, they may be less adept at triaging and caring for older adults with mental health conditions such as delirium, depression, or dementia. The trauma associated with a disaster and relocation will challenge cognitive abilities in those with dementia, may exacerbate existing depression, or lead to the onset of delirium, which is a medical emergency. Older adults experiencing these conditions are at risk for harm and deterioration with serious short and long-term consequences. Since disaster shelter volunteer health care staff may not be well-versed in distinguishing between dementia, depression, or delirium, behavior observation, and safety considerations are critical determinants of whether it is possible to support the older adult in the shelter environment or it is necessary to transition to a higher level of care.
