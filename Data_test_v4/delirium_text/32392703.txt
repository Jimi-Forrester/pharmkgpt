32392703|t|Disruption of Placental Homeostasis Leads to Preeclampsia.
32392703|a|Placental homeostasis is directly linked to fetal well-being and normal fetal growth. Placentas are sensitive to various environmental stressors, including hypoxia, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and oxidative stress. Once placental homeostasis is disrupted, the placenta may rebel against the mother and fetus. Autophagy is an evolutionally conservative mechanism for the maintenance of cellular and organic homeostasis. Evidence suggests that autophagy plays a crucial role throughout pregnancy, including fertilization, placentation, and delivery in human and mouse models. This study reviews the available literature discussing the role of autophagy in preeclampsia.
