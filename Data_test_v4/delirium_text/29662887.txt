29662887|t|Characteristics of Heat Illness during Hajj: A Cross-Sectional Study.
29662887|a|INTRODUCTION: Data regarding the characteristics and outcomes of heat illness are lacking in the literature. The present study aimed to identify the clinical characteristics, morbidity, management, and mortality associated with heat illness among Hajj participants. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted during the Hajj in 2016 on patients who presented to emergency departments and were diagnosed with heat exhaustion or heatstroke. Data were collected using a structured collection sheet developed based on the literature. RESULTS: A total of 267 patients were recruited. Of these, 80 (29%) and 187 (67.75%) were diagnosed with heatstroke and heat exhaustion, with 6.3% and 0.0% mortality, respectively. The mean age of the patients was 54.0 +- 16 years. Diabetes mellitus was the most common comorbidity among both heatstroke and heat exhaustion patients. The majority of patients had hyperthermia and electrolyte imbalance. Most of the heat illness cases were treated per heat illness guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: Although authorities are working on research and forming interdisciplinary teams to prevent health problems during the Hajj, the mortality rate from heatstroke is high and the majority of the patients had hyperthermia, varied signs and symptoms, elevated creatinine levels, and electrolyte imbalances.
