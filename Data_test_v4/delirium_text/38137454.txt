38137454|t|Inflammatory Pathways in Overweight and Obese Persons as a Potential Mechanism for Cognitive Impairment and Earlier Onset Alzeihmer's Dementia in the General Population: A Narrative Review.
38137454|a|The overweight status or obesity can be confirmed through classical methods such as the body mass index (BMI) and the waist-to-hip ratio (WHR). Apart from metabolic issues such as atherosclerosis, liver steatosis, or diabetes mellitus, long-term obesity or overweight status can pose a risk for cardiovascular and neurovascular complications. While some acute adverse events like coronary syndromes of strokes are well-documented to be linked to an increased body mass, there are also chronic processes that, due to their silent onset and evolution, are underdiagnosed and not as thoroughly studied. Through this review, we aimed to collect all relevant data with regard to the long-term impact of obesity on cognitive function in all ages and its correlation with an earlier onset of dementia such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). The exact mechanisms through which a decline in cognitive functions occurs in overweight or obese persons are still being discussed. A combination of factors has been acknowledged as potential triggers, such as a sedentary lifestyle and stress, as well as a genetic predisposition, for example, the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) alleles in AD. Most research highlights the impact of vascular dysfunction and systemic inflammation on the nervous system in patients with obesity and the subsequent neurological changes. Obesity during the early to mid-ages leads to an earlier onset of cognitive dysfunction in various forms. Also, lifestyle intervention can reverse cognitive dysfunction, especially dieting, to encourage weight loss.
