37106682|t|Density Spectral Array Enables Precise Sedation Control for Supermicrosurgical Lymphaticovenous Anastomosis: A Retrospective Observational Cohort Study.
37106682|a|Supermicrosurgical lymphaticovenous anastomosis (LVA) is a minimally invasive surgical technique that creates bypasses between lymphatic vessels and veins, thereby improving lymphatic drainage and reducing lymphedema. This retrospective single-center study included 137 patients who underwent non-intubated LVA in southern Taiwan. A total of 119 patients were enrolled and assigned to two study groups: the geriatric (age >= 75 years, n = 23) and non-geriatric groups (age < 75 years, n = 96). The primary outcome was to investigate and compare the arousal and maintenance of the propofol effect-site concentration (Ce) using an electroencephalographic density spectral array (EEG DSA) in both groups. The results showed that the geriatric group required less propofol (4.05 [3.73-4.77] mg/kg/h vs. 5.01 [4.34-5.92] mg/kg/h, p = 0.001) and alfentanil (4.67 [2.53-5.82] mug/kg/h vs. 6.68 [3.85-8.77] mug/kg/h, p = 0.047). The median arousal Ce of propofol among the geriatric group (0.6 [0.5-0.7] mug/mL) was significantly lower than that in patients aged <= 54 years (1.3 [1.2-1.4] mug/mL, p < 0.001), 55-64 years (0.9 [0.8-1.0] mug/mL, p < 0.001), and <75 years (0.9 [0.8-1.2] mug/mL, p < 0.001). In summary, the combined use of EEG DSA provides the objective and depth of adequate sedation for extensive non-intubated anesthesia in late-elderly patients who undergo LVA without perioperative complications.
