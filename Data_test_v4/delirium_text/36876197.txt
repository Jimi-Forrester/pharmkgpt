36876197|t|Long-term Survival and Quality of Life among Survivors Discharged from a Respiratory ICU in North India: A Prospective Study.
36876197|a|Background: Advancements in the intensive care unit (ICU) have improved critically ill subjects' short-term outcomes. However, there is a need to understand the long-term outcomes of these subjects. Herein, we study the long-term outcomes and factors associated with poor outcomes in critically ill subjects with medical illnesses. Materials and methods: All subjects (>=12 years) discharged after an ICU stay of at least 48 hours were included. We evaluated the subjects at 3 and 6 months after ICU discharge. At each visit, subjects were administered the World Health Organization Quality of Life Instrument (WHO-QOL-BREF) questionnaire. The primary outcome was mortality at 6 months after ICU discharge. The key secondary outcome was quality of life (QOL) at 6 months. Results: In total, 265 subjects were admitted to the ICU, of whom 53 subjects (20%) died in the ICU, and 54 were excluded. Finally, 158 subjects were included: 10 (6.3%) subjects were lost to follow-up. The mortality at 6 months was 17.7% (28/158). Most subjects [16.5% (26/158)] died within the initial 3 months after ICU discharge. Quality of life scores were low in all the domains of WHO-QOL-BREF. About 12% (n = 14) of subjects could not perform the activity of daily living at 6 months. After adjusting for covariates, ICU-acquired weakness at the time of discharge (OR 15.12; 95% CI, 2.08-109.81, p <0.01) and requirement for home ventilation (OR 22; 95% CI, 3.1-155, p <0.01) were associated with mortality at 6 months. Conclusion: Intensive care unit survivors have a high risk of death and a poor QOL during the initial 6 months following discharge.
