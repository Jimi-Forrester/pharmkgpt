37971604|t|A new acyl derivative of sulfadimethoxine inhibits phagocyte oxidative burst and ameliorates inflammation in a mice model of zymosan-induced generalised inflammation.
37971604|a|Chronic inflammation and oxidative stress play a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of most challenging illnesses, including cancer, Alzheimer's, cardiovascular and autoimmune diseases. The present study aimed to investigate the anti-inflammatory potential of a new sulfadimethoxine derivative N-(4-(N-(2,6-dimethoxypyrimidin-4-yl) sulfamoyl) phenyl) dodecanamide (MHH-II-32). The compound was characterised by applying 1H-, 13C-NMR, EI-MS and HRFAB-MS spectroscopic techniques. The compound inhibited zymosan-induced oxidative bursts from whole blood phagocytes and isolated polymorphonuclear cells with an IC50 value of (2.5 +- 0.4 and 3.4 +- 0.3 microg/mL), respectively. Furthermore, the inhibition of nitric oxide with an IC50 (3.6 +- 2.2 microg/mL) from lipopolysaccharide-induced J774.2 macrophages indicates its in vitro anti-inflammatory efficacy. The compound did not show toxicity towards normal fibroblast cells. The observational findings, gross anatomical analysis of visceral organs and serological tests revealed the non-toxicity of the compound at the highest tested intraperitoneal (IP) dose of 100 mg/kg in acute toxicological studies in Balb/c mice. The compound treatment (100 mg/kg) (SC) significantly (P < 0.001) downregulated the mRNA expression of inflammatory markers TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-2, IL-13, and NF-kappaB, which were elevated in zymosan-induced generalised inflammation (IP) in Balb/c mice while upregulated the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, which was reduced in zymosan-treated mice. No suppressive effect was observed at the dose of 25 mg/kg. Ibuprofen was taken as a standard drug. The results revealed that the new acyl derivative of sulfadimethoxine has an immunomodulatory effect against generalised inflammatory response with non-toxicity both in vitro and in vivo, and has therapeutic potential for various chronic inflammatory illnesses.
