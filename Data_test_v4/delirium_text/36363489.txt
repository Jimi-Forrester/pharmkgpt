36363489|a|Background and Objectives: The main objective of a transitional care program (TCP) is to detect patients with early deterioration following intensive care unit (ICU) discharge in order to reduce unplanned ICU readmissions. Consensus on the effectiveness of TCPs in preventing unscheduled ICU readmissions remains lacking. In this case study assessing the effectiveness of TCP, we focused on the association of unplanned ICU readmission with high nursing activities scores (NASs), which are considered a risk factor for ICU readmission. Materials and Methods: This retrospective observational study analyzed the data of patients admitted to a single-center ICU between January 2016 and December 2019, with an NAS of >53 points at ICU discharge. The following data were extracted: patient characteristics, ICU treatment, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II) score at ICU admission, Charlson comorbidity index (CCI), 28-day mortality rate, and ICU readmission rate. The primary outcome was the association between unplanned ICU readmissions and the use of a TCP. The propensity score (PS) was calculated using the following variables: age, sex, APACHE II score, and CCI. Subsequently, logistic regression analysis was performed using the PS to evaluate the outcomes. Results: A total of 143 patients were included in this study, of which 87 (60.8%) participated in a TCP. Respiratory failure was the most common cause of unplanned ICU readmission. The unplanned ICU readmission rate was significantly lower in the TCP group. In the logistic regression model, TCP (odds ratio, 5.15; 95% confidence interval, 1.46-18.2; p = 0.01) was independently associated with unplanned ICU readmission. Conclusions: TCP intervention with a focus on patients with a high NAS (>53 points) may prevent unplanned ICU readmission.
