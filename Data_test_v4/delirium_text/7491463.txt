7491463|t|[Delirium: occurrence, diagnosis and therapy].
7491463|a|Delirium, i.e. an acute confusional state, is frequently observed in a general hospital. Prevalence of delirium increases with higher age, usually in patients with cognitive deficits (e.g. signs indicative of some dementia) and particularly in those older patients with severe somatic illness. Symptoms of delirium are considerably uniform irrespective of different etiological causes; however, delirium is frequently underrecognized, which may lead to several complications and higher mortality rates. In this article the authors summarize data on prevalence, symptomatology as well as etiology and pathogenesis of delirium. In addition, syndromes which may have symptoms similar to delirium are discussed, and their treatment is recommended.
