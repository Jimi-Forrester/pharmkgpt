30241344|t|Neglected Functions of TFCP2/TFCP2L1/UBP1 Transcription Factors May Offer Valuable Insights into Their Mechanisms of Action.
30241344|a|In recent years, the TFCP2 (transcription factor cellular promoter 2)/TFCP2L1 (TFCP2-like 1)/UBP1 (upstream binding protein 1) subfamily of transcription factors has been attracting increasing attention in the scientific community. These factors are very important in cancer, Alzheimer's disease, and other human conditions, and they can be attractive targets for drug development. However, the interpretation of experimental results is complicated, as in principle, any of these factors could substitute for the lack of another. Thus, studying their hitherto little known functions should enhance our understanding of mechanisms of their functioning, and analogous mechanisms might govern their functioning in medically relevant contexts. For example, there are numerous parallels between placental development and cancer growth; therefore, investigating the roles of TFCP2, TFCP2L1, and UBP1 in the placenta may help us better understand their functioning in cancer, as is evidenced by the studies of various other proteins and pathways. Our review article aims to call the attention of the scientific community to these neglected functions, and encourage further research in this field. Here, we present a systematic review of current knowledge of the TFCP2/TFCP2L1/UBP1 subfamily in reproduction, embryonic development, renal function, blood-pressure regulation, brain function, and other processes, where their involvement has not been studied much until now.
