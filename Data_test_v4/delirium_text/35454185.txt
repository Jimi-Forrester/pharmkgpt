35454185|t|Cerebral Glutamate Regulation and Receptor Changes in Perioperative Neuroinflammation and Cognitive Dysfunction.
35454185|a|Glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system and is intricately linked to learning and memory. Its activity depends on the expression of AMPA and NMDA receptors and excitatory amino transporters on neurons and glial cells. Glutamate transporters prevent the excess accumulation of glutamate in synapses, which can lead to aberrant synaptic signaling, excitotoxicity, or cell death. Neuroinflammation can occur acutely after surgical trauma and contributes to the development of perioperative neurocognitive disorders, which are characterized by impairment in multiple cognitive domains. In this review, we aim to examine how glutamate handling and glutamatergic function are affected by neuroinflammation and their contribution to cognitive impairment. We will first summarize the current data regarding glutamate in neurotransmission, its receptors, and their regulation and trafficking. We will then examine the impact of inflammation on glutamate handling and neurotransmission, focusing on changes in glial cells and the effect of cytokines. Finally, we will discuss these changes in the context of perioperative neuroinflammation and the implications they have for perioperative neurocognitive disorders.
