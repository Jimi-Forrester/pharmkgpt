20944816|t|Behavioral changes as the earliest clinical manifestation of progressive supranuclear palsy.
20944816|a|BACKGROUND: The clinical and pathological heterogeneity of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is well established. Even with a well-defined clinical phenotype and a thorough laboratory workup, PSP can be misdiagnosed, especially in its early stages. CASE REPORT: A 52-year-old woman, who we initially diagnosed with a behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia developed parkinsonian features, which then progressed to gait instability and gaze abnormality. CONCLUSIONS: We report herein a pathologically confirmed case of PSP presenting with behavioral changes including agitation and irritability, which eventually led to the cardinal symptoms of progressive supranuclear palsy.
