39124999|t|The Mediterranean Species Calendula officinalis and Foeniculum vulgare as Valuable Source of Bioactive Compounds.
39124999|a|Research studies on plant secondary metabolites have increased over the last decades as a consequence of the growing consumer demand for natural products in pharmaceutics and therapeutics, as well as in perfumery and cosmetics. In this perspective, many Mediterranean plant species could be an appreciated source of bioactive compounds with pharmacological and health-promoting properties, including antioxidant, antimicrobial, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and antitumor ones. Calendula officinalis and Foeniculum vulgare are commercially important plants of the Mediterranean flora, with great therapeutic use in the treatment of many disorders since ancient times, and are now listed in several world pharmacopoeias and drug agencies. The present review offers an overview of the main phytochemicals, phenols, terpenes, and alkaloids, biosynthesized in C. officinalis and F. vulgare, both species endemic to the Mediterranean region. Further, all current knowledge and scientific data on taxonomic classification, botanical description, traditional uses, pharmacological studies, and potential toxicity of both species were reported. The principal aim of this review is to point out the prospective use of C. officinalis and F. vulgare as valuable reservoirs of beneficial plant-derived products with interesting biological properties, also providing suggestions and future challenges for the full exploitation of these two Mediterranean species for human life improvement.
