36139759|t|The Role of Nrf2 in Pulmonary Fibrosis: Molecular Mechanisms and Treatment Approaches.
36139759|a|Pulmonary fibrosis is a chronic, progressive, incurable interstitial lung disease with high mortality after diagnosis and remains a global public health problem. Despite advances and breakthroughs in understanding the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis, there are still no effective methods for the prevention and treatment of pulmonary fibrosis. The existing treatment options are imperfect, expensive, and have considerable limitations in effectiveness and safety. Hence, there is an urgent need to find novel therapeutic targets. The nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a central regulator of cellular antioxidative responses, inflammation, and restoration of redox balance. Accumulating reports reveal that Nrf2 activators exhibit potent antifibrosis effects and significantly attenuate pulmonary fibrosis in vivo and in vitro. This review summarizes the current Nrf2-related knowledge about the regulatory mechanism and potential therapies in the process of pulmonary fibrosis. Nrf2 orchestrates the activation of multiple protective genes that target inflammation, oxidative stress, fibroblast-myofibroblast differentiation (FMD), and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and the mechanisms involve Nrf2 and its downstream antioxidant, Nrf2/HO-1/NQO1, Nrf2/NOX4, and Nrf2/GSH signaling pathway. We hope to indicate potential for Nrf2 system as a therapeutic target for pulmonary fibrosis.
