32630299|a|Immunotherapy focusing on reducing the amyloid-beta (Abeta) burden is a promising treatment strategy for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Many clinical studies on AD immunotherapies have failed due to low safety and efficacy, calling for a highly potent AD vaccine which induces sufficient antibody titer while avoiding side effects. Here, we designed a yeast-based vaccine Y-5A15 comprising five copies of Abeta1-15 displayed on the surface of yeast cell wall, and we subcutaneously immunized APP/PS1 mice three times. Our results demonstrated that the Y-5A15 remarkably enhanced the Abeta epitope immunogenicity and elicited high antibody titers against Abeta in AD mice. Importantly, Y-5A15 vaccination successfully reduced Abeta levels, plaque burden and glial activation, rescued synaptic deficits and significantly ameliorated memory and cognitive decline in APP/PS1 transgenic mice, suggesting that the yeast-based Abeta epitope vaccine has a promising potency for the treatment of AD.
