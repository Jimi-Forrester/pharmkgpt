37239094|t|Ultra-Early Screening of Cognitive Decline Due to Alzheimer's Pathology.
37239094|a|Alzheimer's pathology can be assessed and defined via Abeta and tau biomarkers. The preclinical period of Alzheimer's disease is long and lasts several decades. Although effective therapies to block pathological processes of Alzheimer's disease are still lacking, downward trends in the incidence and prevalence of dementia have occurred in developed countries. Accumulating findings support that education, cognitive training, physical exercise/activities, and a healthy lifestyle can protect cognitive function and promote healthy aging. Many studies focus on detecting mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and take a variety of interventions in this stage to protect cognitive function. However, when Alzheimer's pathology advances to the stage of MCI, interventions may not be successful in blocking the development of the pathological process. MCI individuals reverting to normal cognitive function exhibited a high probability to progress to dementia. Therefore, it is necessary to take effective measures before the MCI stage. Compared with MCI, an earlier stage, transitional cognitive decline, may be a better time window in which effective interventions are adopted for at-risk individuals. Detecting this stage in large populations relies on rapid screening of cognitive function; given that many cognitive tests focus on MCI detection, new tools need to be developed.
