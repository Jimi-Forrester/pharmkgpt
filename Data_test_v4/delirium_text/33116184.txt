33116184|t|Dynamic changes in the brain protein interaction network correlates with progression of Abeta42 pathology in Drosophila.
33116184|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most prevalent form of dementia, is a progressive and devastating neurodegenerative condition for which there are no effective treatments. Understanding the molecular pathology of AD during disease progression may identify new ways to reduce neuronal damage. Here, we present a longitudinal study tracking dynamic proteomic alterations in the brains of an inducible Drosophila melanogaster model of AD expressing the Arctic mutant Abeta42 gene. We identified 3093 proteins from flies that were induced to express Abeta42 and age-matched healthy controls using label-free quantitative ion-mobility data independent analysis mass spectrometry. Of these, 228 proteins were significantly altered by Abeta42 accumulation and were enriched for AD-associated processes. Network analyses further revealed that these proteins have distinct hub and bottleneck properties in the brain protein interaction network, suggesting that several may have significant effects on brain function. Our unbiased analysis provides useful insights into the key processes governing the progression of amyloid toxicity and forms a basis for further functional analyses in model organisms and translation to mammalian systems.
