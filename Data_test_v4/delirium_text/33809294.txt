33809294|t|A REP-FAMSEC Method as a Tool in Explaining Reaction Mechanisms: A Nucleophilic Substitution of 2-Phenylquinoxaline as a DFT Case Study.
33809294|a|In search for the cause leading to low reaction yields, each step along the reaction energy profile computed for the assumed oxidative nucleophilic substitution of hydrogen (ONSH) reaction between 2-phenylquinoxaline and lithium phenylacetylide was modelled computationally. Intermolecular and intramolecular interaction energies and their changes between consecutive steps of ONSH were quantified for molecular fragments playing leading roles in driving the reaction to completion. This revealed that the two reactants have a strong affinity for each other, driven by the strong attractive interactions between Li and two N-atoms, leading to four possible reaction pathways (RP-C2, RP-C3, RP-C5, and RP-C10). Four comparable in energy and stabilizing molecular system adducts were formed, each well prepared for the subsequent formation of a C-C bond at either one of the four identified sites. However, as the reaction proceeded through the TS to form the intermediates (5a-d), very high energy barriers were observed for RP-C5 and RP-C10. The data obtained at the nucleophilic addition stage indicated that RP-C3 was both kinetically and thermodynamically favored over RP-C2. However, the energy barriers observed at this stage were very comparable for both RPs, indicating that they both can progress to form intermediates 5a and 5b. Interestingly, the phenyl substituent (Ph1) on the quinoxaline guided the nucleophile towards both RP-C2 and RP-C3, indicating that the preferred RP cannot be attributed to the steric hindrance caused by Ph1. Upon the introduction of H2O to the system, both RPs were nearly spontaneous towards their respective hydrolysis products (8a and 8b), although only 8b can proceed to the final oxidation stage of the ONSH reaction mechanism. The results suggest that RP-C2 competes with RP-C3, which may lead to a possible mixture of their respective products. Furthermore, an alternative, viable, and irreversible reaction path was discovered for the RP-C2 that might lead to substantial waste. Finally, the modified experimental protocol is suggested to increase the yield of the desired product.
