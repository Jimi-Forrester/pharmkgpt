37178323|t|To Treat or Not to Treat? Dilemmas when Deciding on Antineoplastic Treatment in Patients With Far Advanced Cancers.
37178323|a|Patients with advanced cancers and their oncologists are often faced with difficult treatment decisions, especially when there are borderline situations of expected benefit or increased risk of complications. In this narrative review, we will explore the decision-making process for patients with advanced cancers and provide insights on how to approach this complex task, while didactically dividing the oncologist's assessments according to a mnemonic rule of the ABCDE of therapeutic decision-making. Part A (advanced cancer) recalls that the rule is to be used specifically for advanced cancers. Parts B (potential benefits) and C (clinical conditions and risks) represents the traditional risk vs benefit scale. In Part D, we discuss ways to identify and understand patients' desires, values, preferences, and beliefs. The prognostic estimation, from Part E, may function as an "adjust" for the antineoplastic treatment decision-making. Treatment decisions need to be conducted by skilled oncologists, in a patient-centered care, aiming to promote valuable oncology with lower rates of aggressive care.
