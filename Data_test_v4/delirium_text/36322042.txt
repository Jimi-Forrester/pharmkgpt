36322042|a|BACKGROUND: Up to 40% of delirium cases are preventable, and early identification is key to improve patient outcomes. PURPOSE: To implement and evaluate a multidisciplinary delirium intervention program. INTERVENTION: The delirium intervention program targeted patients at high risk for delirium and included patient and nurse education, risk stratification, multidisciplinary rounds, a nonpharmacological intervention bundle, and a treatment order set. RESULTS: After implementation, there was a reduction in length of stay of 6.3 days ( P = .01), a 24% decrease in disposition to a skilled nursing facility ( P = .05), and increased detection of delirium by nurses. CONCLUSION: Positive patient outcomes were achieved by employing a multifactorial approach for delirium identification, prevention, and management. The components of this quality improvement project provide guidance to hospitals seeking to develop a delirium intervention program.
