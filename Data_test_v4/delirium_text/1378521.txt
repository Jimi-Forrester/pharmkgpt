1378521|t|Expression of Alu and 7SL RNA in Alzheimer's and control brains.
1378521|a|We investigated whether changes in expression of RNA polymerase III (pol III) or heterodisperse RNA polymerase II (pol II) transcripts hybridizing to Alu could be detected in Alzheimer's disease (AD). RNA samples obtained from AD and control brain tissues were examined by Northern analysis for Alu and 7SL RNA expression. All RNA samples contained a prominent band of approximately 300 nucleotides which corresponds to 7SL RNA, the Alu-homologous RNA component of the signal recognition particle. In addition, three small (i.e. less than 300 nucleotide) 7SL/Alu-hybridizing transcripts were detected. The two larger of the low molecular weight transcripts hybridized preferentially to the 7SL RNA probe, while the smallest transcript hybridized to the Alu probe. These transcripts and the heterodisperse RNA were variable in quantity and displayed a lack of correlation with AD.
