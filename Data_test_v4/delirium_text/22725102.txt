22725102|t|Discovery of gamma-secretase modulators with a novel activity profile by text-based virtual screening.
22725102|a|We present an integrated approach to identify and optimize a novel class of gamma-secretase modulators (GSMs) with a unique pharmacological profile. Our strategy included (i) virtual screening through application of a recently developed protocol (PhAST), (ii) synthetic chemistry to discover structure-activity relationships, and (iii) detailed in vitro pharmacological characterization. GSMs are promising agents for treatment or prevention of Alzheimer's disease. They modulate the gamma-secretase product spectrum (i.e., amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides of different length) and induce a shift from toxic Abeta42 to shorter Abeta species such as Abeta38 with no or minimal effect on the overall rate of gamma-secretase cleavage. We describe the identification of a series of 4-hydroxypyridin-2-one derivatives, which display a novel type of gamma-secretase modulation with equipotent inhibition of Abeta42 and Abeta38 peptide species.
