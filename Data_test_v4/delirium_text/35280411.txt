35280411|a|Background: To study the effect of Narcotrend monitoring on the incidence of early postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) under different Bispectral Index (BIS) conditions and the effect of different depths of anesthesia on the incidence of POCD. Methods: We performed a literature search of the PubMed, Embase, OVID (database system made by Ovid Technologies, USA), Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), VIP Chinese Sci-tech Journals Database, Wanfang Data, etc. from the date of establishment of the database until December 31, 2020. Results: In the end, eighty articles were included, with a total of 714 patients. The meta-analysis results showed that four articles (255 patients) compared the state of deep anesthesia (BIS 30-40) with conventional anesthesia (BIS 40-60 earlier) after POCD. Also, the incidence of POCD on the first day after deep anesthesia [Narcotrend stage (NTS): negative correlation is currently the most appropriate egg description; Nd can subdivide the original electroencephalogram (EEG) into six stages 15 levels (Nd Sg, NTS), or A (state of wakefulness), state B0-B2 (sedated state), state C0-C2 (light anesthetic state), state D0-D2 (general anesthesia), state E0-E2 (deep anesthesia state), and state F0-F2 (burst suppression state)] was significantly lower than that of conventional anesthesia (NTS D0-D1) [odds ratio (OR) =0.21, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.13-0.35, P<0.00001]. Moreover, the incidence of POCD in deep anesthesia (NTS E1) at 7 days after surgery was significantly lower than that of conventional anesthesia (NTS D0) (OR =0.45, 95% CI: 0.23-0.91, P=0.03), while the incidence of POCD 7 days after NTS D2 in conventional anesthesia was significantly lower than that of NTS D0 (OR =0.42, 95% CI: 0.24-0.71, P=0.001). Discussions: POCDs are thought to be the result of a combination of physical defects and precipitating factors in patients with their own physical impairments, and despite potential adverse effects, there is currently no consensus on the incidence of POCDs in patients with tumor, current risk factors, causes, and prevention strategies. Moreover, the level of evidence is low, and the deviation between different studies cannot be ruled out.
