29282295|a|Amyloid-beta (Abeta) and human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP) aggregate to form amyloid fibrils that deposit in tissues and are associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and type II diabetes (T2D), respectively. Individuals with T2D have an increased risk of developing AD, and conversely, AD patients have an increased risk of developing T2D. Evidence suggests that this link between AD and T2D might originate from a structural similarity between aggregates of Abeta and hIAPP. Using the cryoEM method microelectron diffraction, we determined the atomic structures of 11-residue segments from both Abeta and hIAPP, termed Abeta(24-34) WT and hIAPP(19-29) S20G, with 64% sequence similarity. We observed a high degree of structural similarity between their backbone atoms (0.96-A root mean square deviation). Moreover, fibrils of these segments induced amyloid formation through self- and cross-seeding. Furthermore, inhibitors designed for one segment showed cross-efficacy for full-length Abeta and hIAPP and reduced cytotoxicity of both proteins, although by apparently blocking different cytotoxic mechanisms. The similarity of the atomic structures of Abeta(24-34) WT and hIAPP(19-29) S20G offers a molecular model for cross-seeding between Abeta and hIAPP.
