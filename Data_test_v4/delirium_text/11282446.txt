11282446|t|Heterogeneity in early onset alcoholism suggests a third group of alcoholics.
11282446|a|Data from 141 Brazilian male alcoholics were investigated with the objective of further exploring the heterogeneity of alcoholism and to replicate previous studies. A set of seven variables was studied by different cluster analyses to test hypotheses with two, three, and four groups. The results suggested that the best solution showed three groups of alcoholics, two of them similar to those previously described and a third relatively similar to type 2, but with lower scores in harm avoidance, more positive impact of life events, higher proportion of alcoholic relatives, less frequent use of antianxiety drugs, and less delirium tremens. These results reinforced the model with three groups and may be useful in the delineation of new etiology and treatment studies.
