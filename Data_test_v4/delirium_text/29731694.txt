29731694|t|The role of some ADAM-proteins and activation of the insulin growth factor-related pathway in colorectal cancer.
29731694|a|Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common malignant neoplasm worldwide. In Poland, colorectal cancer ranks second in tumor incidence regardless of sex; moreover, there has been a steady increase in the incidence of CRC. CRC results from complex interactions between inherited susceptibility, clinical conditions and environmental/lifestyle-related risk factors such as physical inactivity, smoking, alcohol consumption, high-fat/low-fiber diet, and obesity/overweight. The activation of pathways associated with insulin resistance and insulin-like growth factors (IGF) appears to be the epidemiological link between the metabolic syndrome and the development of CRC, which is of particular importance. What is significantly associated with the pathway of IGF is ADAM12 and 28-protein, which belong to a broad family of the adamalysines. These proteins, by adjusting the bioavailability of growth factors, influence the process of carcinogenesis. The aim of this article is to analyze the role of selected adamalysines and activation of the IGF system associated with the formation of colon cancer.
