32911634|t|Pro-Aging Effects of Xanthine Oxidoreductase Products.
32911634|a|The senescence process is the result of a series of factors that start from the genetic constitution interacting with epigenetic modifications induced by endogenous and environmental causes and that lead to a progressive deterioration at the cellular and functional levels. One of the main causes of aging is oxidative stress deriving from the imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen (ROS) and nitrogen (RNS) species and their scavenging through antioxidants. Xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) activities produce uric acid, as well as reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, which all may be relevant to such equilibrium. This review analyzes XOR activity through in vitro experiments, animal studies and clinical reports, which highlight the pro-aging effects of XOR products. However, XOR activity contributes to a regular level of ROS and RNS, which appears essential for the proper functioning of many physiological pathways. This discourages the use of therapies with XOR inhibitors, unless symptomatic hyperuricemia is present.
