39804761|a|Introduction People with type 2 diabetes (T2D) have a greater risk of developing neurodegenerative diseases, like Alzheimer's disease, in later life. Exogenous ketone supplements containing the ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-OHB) may be a strategy to protect the brain as beta-OHB can support cerebral metabolism and promote neuronal plasticity via expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Methods and Results Parallel human (ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT04194450, ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT05155410) and rodent trials were conducted to characterize the effect of acute and short-term exogenous ketone supplementation on indices of brain health. First, we aimed to investigate the effect of acute and short-term supplementation of exogenous ketone monoester on circulating BDNF and cognition in adults with T2D. There were no effects of ketone supplementation on plasma BDNF or cognition. Second, we aimed to investigate the mechanistic effects of acute and chronic beta-OHB supplementation on cortical BDNF content and recognition memory in C57BL/6J mice with and without insulin resistance. Acutely, beta-OHB did not alter recognition memory or BDNF content. Similarly, chronic beta-OHB supplementation did not alter recognition memory or BDNF content. Conclusions Collectively, our data demonstrates that ketone supplementation does not elevate BDNF content in humans or mice. Further, our data does not support the involvement of BDNF in the potential cognitive benefits of beta-OHB supplementation.
