35563011|t|The Influence of Selected Antipsychotic Drugs on Biochemical Aspects of Alzheimer's Disease.
35563011|a|The aim of this study was to assess the potency of selected antipsychotic drugs (haloperidol (HAL), bromperidol (BRMP), benperidol (BNP), penfluridol (PNF), pimozide (PIM), quetiapine (QUET) and promazine (PROM)) on the main pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Binary mixtures of donepezil and antipsychotics produce an anti-BuChE effect, which was greater than either compound alone. The combination of rivastigmine and antipsychotic drugs (apart from PNF) enhanced AChE inhibition. The tested antipsychotics (excluding HAL and PNF) significantly reduce the early stage of Abeta aggregation. BRMP, PIM, QUET and PROM were found to substantially inhibit Abeta aggregation after a longer incubation time. A test of human erythrocytes hemolysis showed that short-term incubation of red blood cells (RBCs) with QUET resulted in decreased hemolysis. The antioxidative properties of antipsychotics were also proved in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC); all tested drugs were found to significantly increase cell viability. In the case of astrocytes, BNP, PNF, PIM and PROM showed antioxidant potential.
