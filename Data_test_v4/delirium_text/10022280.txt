10022280|a|Increased glutamate release is associated with serious neurological disorders such as epilepsy, stroke, Alzheimer's disease and other brain injuries. Excessive glutamate release and subsequent glutamatergic neuronal stimulation increase the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which in turn induce oxidative stress, excitotoxicity and neuronal damage. A number of studies have shown that co-exposure of neuronal cells to glutamate, and an environmental toxin, lead, can greatly amplify glutamate excitotoxicity and cell death through apoptosis or necrosis. Even though the mechanisms of excitotoxicity or those of glutamate-lead interactions have not been exhaustively delineated, there is ample evidence to suggest that increased production of ROS may play an important role in both events. Subsequently, increased DNA binding of redox-regulated transcription factors, NF-kappaB and AP-1, seems to be associated with these events. Induction of an immediate early gene, c-fos, is seen in neuronal cells exposed to glutamate or lead. Immediate early genes are important in regulating the expression of other neuronal genes; Elevated expressions of the genes encoding Hsp70 or cyclo-oxygenase-2 seem to be involved in the apoptosis or necrosis induced by glutamate, and may be associated with induction of several of the genes in cells exposed to lead, or to the glutamate-lead combination. Further studies are required to clarify the mechanisms of glutamate-lead neurotoxicity.
