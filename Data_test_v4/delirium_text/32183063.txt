32183063|t|From Rust to Quantum Biology: The Role of Iron in Retina Physiopathology.
32183063|a|Iron is essential for cell survival and function. It is a transition metal, that could change its oxidation state from Fe2+ to Fe3+ involving an electron transfer, the key of vital functions but also organ dysfunctions. The goal of this review is to illustrate the primordial role of iron and local iron homeostasis in retinal physiology and vision, as well as the pathological consequences of iron excess in animal models of retinal degeneration and in human retinal diseases. We summarize evidence of the potential therapeutic effect of iron chelation in retinal diseases and especially the interest of transferrin, a ubiquitous endogenous iron-binding protein, having the ability to treat or delay degenerative retinal diseases.
