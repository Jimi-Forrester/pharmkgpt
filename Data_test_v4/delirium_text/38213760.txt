38213760|a|Objective: To assess the experience of families and clinicians at a long term acute care hospital (LTACH) after implementing a written communication intervention. Methods: Written communication templates were developed for six clinical disciplines. LTACH clinicians used templates to describe the condition of 30 mechanically ventilated patients at up to three time points. Completed templates were the basis for written summaries that were sent to families. Impressions of the intervention among families (n = 21) and clinicians (n = 17) were assessed using a descriptive correlational design. Interviews were analyzed using thematic content analysis. Results: We identified four themes during interviews with families: Written summaries 1) facilitated communication with LTACH staff, 2) reduced stress related to COVID-19 visitor restrictions, 3) facilitated understanding of the patient condition, prognosis, and goals and 4) facilitated communication among family members. Although clinicians understood why families would appreciate written material, they did not feel that the intervention addressed their main challenge - overly optimistic expectations for patient recovery among families. Conclusion: Written communication positively affected the experience of families of LTACH patients, but was less useful for clinicians. Innovation: Use of written patient care updates helps LTACH clinicians initiate communication with families.
