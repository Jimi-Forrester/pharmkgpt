38602059|a|BACKGROUND: Delirium, which is prevalent in critical care settings, remains underexplored in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients in the cardiac intensive care unit (CICU). AIMS: To investigate the prevalence and clinical significance of delirium in patients with ACS admitted to the CICU. STUDY DESIGN: A prospective study (n = 106, mean age 74.2 +- 5.7 years) assessed delirium using the confusion assessment method-intensive care unit (CAM-ICU) tool in 21.7% of ACS patients during their CICU stay. Baseline characteristics, geriatric conditions and clinical procedures were compared between delirious and nondelirious patients. The outcomes included in-hospital mortality, 30-day and 6-month mortality, acute adverse events and length of CICU stay and hospital stay (LOS). RESULTS: Delirious patients who were older and had a higher incidence of coronary artery disease underwent more complex procedures (e.g., pacemaker placement). Multivariate analysis identified central venous catheter insertion, urinary catheterization and benzodiazepine use as independent predictors of delirium. Delirium was correlated with prolonged LOS (p < .001) and increased in-hospital, 30-day and 6-month mortality (p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Delirium in ACS patients in the CICU extends hospitalization and increases in-hospital, 30-day and 6-month mortality. Early recognition and targeted interventions are crucial for mitigating adverse outcomes in this high-risk population. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: This study highlights the critical impact of delirium on outcomes in hospitalized patients with ACS in the CICU. Delirium, often overlooked in ACS management, significantly extends hospitalization and increases mortality rates. Nurses and physicians must be vigilant in identifying delirium early, particularly in older ACS patients or those with comorbidities. Recognizing independent predictors such as catheterization and benzodiazepine use allows for targeted interventions to reduce delirium incidence. Integrating routine delirium assessments and preventive strategies into ACS management protocols can improve outcomes, optimize resource utilization and enhance overall patient care in the CICU setting.
