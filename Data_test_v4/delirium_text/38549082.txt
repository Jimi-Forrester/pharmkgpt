38549082|a|BACKGROUND: Based on a longitudinal cohort design, the aim of this study was to investigate whether individual-based 18F fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG-PET) regional signals can predict dementia conversion in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). METHODS: We included 44 MCI converters (MCI-C), 38 non-converters (MCI-NC), 42 patients with Alzheimer's disease with dementia, and 40 cognitively normal controls. Data from annual cognitive measurements, 3D T1 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, and 18F-FDG-PET scans were used for outcome analysis. An individual-based FDG-PET approach was applied using seven volumes of interest (VOIs), Z transformed using a normal FDG-PET template. Hypometabolism was defined as a Z score < -2 of regional standard uptake value ratio. For the longitudinal cognitive test scores, generalized estimating equations were used. A linear mixed-effects model was used to compare the temporal impact of cortical hypometabolism and cortical thickness degeneration. RESULTS: The clinical follow-up period was 6.6 +- 3.8 years (range 3.1 to 16.0 years). The trend of cognitive decline could differentiate MCI-C from MCI-NC after 3 years of follow-up. In the baseline 18F-FDG-PET scan of the patients with MCI, medial temporal lobe (MTL; 94.7% sensitivity, 80.5% specificity) and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC; 89.5% sensitivity, 73.1% specificity) hypometabolism predicted conversion with high accuracy. 18F-FDG-PET hypometabolism preceded dementia conversion at an interval of 3.70 +- 1.68 years and was earlier than volumetric changes, with the exception of the MTL. CONCLUSIONS: Our finding supports the use of individual-based 18F-FDG-PET analysis to predict MCI conversion to dementia. Reduced FDG-PET metabolism in the MTL and PCC were strongly associated with future cognitive decline in the MCI-C group. Changes in 18F-FDG-PET occurred 1 to 8 years prior to conversion to dementia. Progressive hypometabolism in the PCC, precuneus and lateral temporal lobe, but not MTL, preceded MRI findings at the MCI stage.
