37978485|a|BACKGROUND: To explore the response and management experiences of nurses and nurse aides in dementia special care units when caring for residents with sundown syndrome based on the person-centered care model. METHODS: Focus group interviews were conducted among nurses and nurse aides from four dementia special care units that have been accredited by the Ministry of Health and Welfare in Taiwan. Content analysis was used for data analysis. RESULTS: The 29 nurses and nurse aides were recruited to participate in the study. Analysis of interview content revealed six themes, identifying the intra-individual, inter-individual, and organizational dimensions. The central topic was commitment. Under the umbrella of commitment, six themes including self-preparation, non-suppression, diversion, pacification, continuity of meeting, and collaboration, which had 18 subthemes, emerged as responsive care practices for person-centered care when supporting residents with sundown syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: The findings provide responsive care practices based on person-centered care for people living with dementia who develop sundown syndrome. The study can inform practices for quality of care for dementia in long-term care institutions and contribute to the development of materials for nursing training and education.
