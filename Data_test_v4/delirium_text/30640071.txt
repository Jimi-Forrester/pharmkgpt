30640071|t|Synthesis, antioxidant and Abeta anti-aggregation properties of new ferulic, caffeic and lipoic acid derivatives obtained by the Ugi four-component reaction.
30640071|a|We report herein the synthesis antioxidant and Abeta anti-aggregation capacity of (E)-N-benzyl-N-[2-(benzylamino)-2-oxoethyl]-3-(aryl)acrylamides and related (R)-N-benzyl-N-(2-(benzylamino)-2-oxoethyl)-5-(1,2-dithiolan-3-yl)pentanamides 1-12. These compounds have been obtained, via Ugi four-component reaction, from modest to good yields. Their antioxidant analysis, using the DPPH and ORAC assays, allowed us to identify compounds 8 and 9, as potent antioxidant agents, showing also strong Abeta1-40 self-aggregation inhibition, two biological properties of interest in pathologies linked to the oxidative stress, such as Alzheimer's disease.
