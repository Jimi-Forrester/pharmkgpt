36284608|a|Adequate and accurate information reduces pandemic fear in elderly women with chronic disease, one of the risk groups for COVID-19. We aim to determine the effect of pecha kucha pandemic training on the fear and belief in myths of COVID-19 in elderly women. This prospective, randomized controlled experimental study with pre- and post-tests employed a total of 64 elderly women, including 32 for each of experimental and control groups. The data were collected using an introductory information form, the Questionnaire for Beliefs in COVID-19 Myths, and the Fear of COVID-19 Scale. Women in the experimental group were informed about COVID-19, using a pecha kucha presentation via smart phone. Those in the control group were given the same information using classical lecture method. The data were collected before, just after, and 3 months after the training and analyzed using Pearson's chi-square, Mann-Whitney U, Friedman, Wilcoxon Signed Ranks tests. Elderly women in the experimental group had significantly lower fear and belief in myths of COVID-19 both just after and 3 months after the training (p < 0.05, p < 0.05). A pandemic training by pecha-kucha presentation, which is a short, clear, understandable and memorable method of teaching, can reduce both fear and belief in myths of COVID-19 in elderly women.
