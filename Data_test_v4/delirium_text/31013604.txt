31013604|t|Associations of Lipophilic Micronutrients with Physical and Cognitive Fitness in Persons with Mild Cognitive Impairment.
31013604|a|Age-associated cognitive impairment in general and dementia in particular are a global concern. Preventive lifestyle strategies are highly used but there is a lack of information on the reciprocal relationships between nutrition biomarkers and measures of both cognitive and physical performance. To fill this gap of knowledge, the relationship between plasma levels of the robust nutrition- and antioxidant defense-related biomarkers carotenoid and tocopherols and both indicators of cognitive and physical performance was investigated in a group of persons with mild cognitive impairment participating in the NeuroExercise Study at the German Sport University in Cologne, Germany. In 56 participants with full dataset, significant correlations independently of fruit and vegetable intake were found between plasma levels of beta-cryptoxanthin and Timed Up&Go test (p < 0.05), gamma-tocopherol and number of daily steps (p < 0.01), as well as between four out of six measured carotenoids-lutein; zeaxanthin; beta-cryptoxanthin and beta-carotene-and the computerized CogState International Shopping List subtest (p < 0.01). In light of the increasing attention towards the nutritional cognitive neuroscience of carotenoids, computerized measures of cognitive performance might be further implemented in future studies investigating the effects of lifestyle interventions against cognitive and physical impairment.
