39910037|a|Immune checkpoint inhibitors have demonstrated modest efficacy as a monotherapy in ovarian cancer. Originally developed to improve efficacy of T-cell therapies such as immune checkpoint inhibitors and adoptive cell transfer, TILT-123 (Ad5/3-E2F-D24-hTNFalpha-IRES-hIL-2) is a serotype chimeric oncolytic adenovirus encoding tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-2. Here we report results from phase 1a of PROTA, a single-arm, multicentre dose escalation trial with TILT-123 and pembrolizumab in female patients with platinum resistant or refractory ovarian cancer (NCT05271318). The primary endpoint was safety. Secondary endpoints included efficacy, tolerability, virus persistence and anti-viral immunity. Patients (n = 15) received intravenous and intraperitoneal and/or intratumoral injections of TILT-123 as well as intravenous pembrolizumab. Treatment was well tolerated, and no dose-limiting toxicities were observed. The most frequent adverse events were fever (40%), fatigue (40%) and nausea (40%). Disease control was achieved in 64% of evaluable patients (9/14). Median progression-free survival and overall survival were 98 and 190 days respectively. Clinical responses were associated with higher serum anti-adenovirus neutralizing antibody titer at baseline and post-treatment. The phase 1b investigating TILT-123, pembrolizumab and PEGylated liposomal doxorubicin in a similar patient population is underway.
