33726969|t|Role of rafts in neurological disorders.
33726969|a|INTRODUCTION: Rafts are function-structural cell membrane nano-domains. They contribute to explain the efficiency of signal transduction at the low physiological membrane concentrations of the signaling partners by their clustering inside specialized signaling domains. DEVELOPMENT: In this article, we review the current model of the membrane rafts and their physio-pathological relevance in the nervous system, including their role in Parkinson, Alzheimer, and Huntington diseases. CONCLUSIONS: Rafts disruption/dysfunction has been shown to relate diverse neurological diseases. Therefore, it has been suggested that preservation of membrane rafts may represent a strategy to prevent or delay neuronal dysfunctions in several diseases.
