11089574|t|Microtubule-affinity regulating kinase (MARK) is tightly associated with neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer brain: a fluorescence resonance energy transfer study.
11089574|a|Paired helical filaments, the main structural components of the neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer disease, consist of phosphorylated tau protein. Because the levels and degree of phosphorylation are significantly higher in paired helical filament (PHF)-derived tau than in normal adult tau, and because phosphorylation of tau severely disrupts microtubule stability, it is postulated that tau phosphorylation is an important step in PHF formation. The kinases and/or phosphatases that act in vivo to help induce such a pathological state of tau, however, are not yet known. In this study we implicate the non-proline directed kinase MARK in PHF-tau phosphorylation, by virtue of its close intermolecular association with the phosphorylated Ser262 epitope on PHF-tau as assessed by fluorescence resonance energy transfer. Moreover, because this tight enzyme-substrate association is observed in neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer tissue, we suggest that PHF-tau phosphorylation may occur to some extent on assembled PHF filaments.
