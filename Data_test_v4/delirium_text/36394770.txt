36394770|a|Brain injury and cognitive impairment are major health issues associated with neurodegenerative diseases in young and aged persons worldwide. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) was studied for its ability to protect against methionine (Met)-induced brain damage and cognitive dysfunction. Male mice were given Met-supplemented in drinking water to produce hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy)-induced animals. EGCG was administered daily concurrently with Met by gavage. EGCG attenuated the rise in homocysteine levels in the plasma and the formation of amyloid-beta and tau protein in the brain. Cognitive and memory impairment in HHcy-induced mice were significantly improved by EGCG administration. These results were associated with improvement in glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid levels in the brain. EGCG maintained the levels of glutathione and the activity of antioxidant enzymes in the brain. As a result of the reduction of oxidative stress, EGCG protected against DNA damage in Met-treated mice. Moreover, maintaining the redox balance significantly ameliorated neuroinflammation evidenced by the normalization of IL-1beta, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha, C-reactive protein, and IL-13 in the same animals. The decreases in both oxidative stress and inflammatory cytokines were significantly associated with upregulation of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 protein and downregulation of the proapoptotic protein Bax, caspases 3 and 9, and p53 compared with Met-treated animals, indicating a diminution of neuronal apoptosis. These effects reflect and explain the improvement in histopathological alterations in the hippocampus of Met-treated mice. In conclusion, the beneficial effects of EGCG may be due to interconnecting pathways, including modulation of redox balance, amelioration of inflammation, and regulation of antiapoptotic proteins.
