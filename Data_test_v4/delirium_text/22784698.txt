22784698|t|Overview of significant changes in the Minimum Data Set for nursing homes version 3.0.
22784698|a|The Minimum Data Set (MDS) is a standardized assessment that is completed on all residents admitted to Medicare certified nursing homes in the US. It is also completed on all residents admitted to Veteran Health Administration Community Living Centers. Its content addresses multiple domains of resident health and function and is intended to facilitate better recognition of each resident's needs. A new version of the MDS, MDS 3.0, was implemented in October, 2010. This article highlights significant clinical changes found in the MDS 3.0, including new structured resident interviews to assess mood, preferences, pain and cognition; inclusion of the Confusion Assessment Method to screen for delirium; revised psychosis and behavior items; revised balance and falls sections; revised bladder and bowel assessment items; revised pressure ulcer assessment items; revisions to the nutrition items; items reporting on resident expectations for return to the community; and changes to race/ethnicity item and language report. These changes aim to improve the clinical utility of these assessment items.
