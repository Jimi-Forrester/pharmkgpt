32310177|a|This article reviews recent advances in the study of microRNAs (miRNAs), long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), and their functions in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), ischemic stroke (IS), and vascular dementia (VaD). miRNAs and lncRNAs are gene regulation markers that both regulate translational aspects of a wide range of proteins and biological processes in healthy and disease states. Recent studies from our laboratory and others have revealed that miRNAs and lncRNAs expressed differently are potential therapeutic targets for neurological diseases, especially T2DM, IS, VaD, and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Currently, the effect of aging in T2DM, IS, and VaD and the cellular and molecular pathways are largely unknown. In this article, we highlight results from the works on the molecular connections between T2DM and IS, and IS and VaD. In each disease, we also summarize the pathophysiology and the differential expressions of miRNAs and lncRNAs. Based on current research findings, we hypothesize that 1) T2DM bi-directionally and age-dependently induces IS and VaD, and 2) these changes are precursors to the onset of dementia in elderly people. Research into these hypotheses is required to examine further whether research efforts on reducing T2DM, IS, and VaD may affect dementia and/or delay the AD disease process in the aged population.
