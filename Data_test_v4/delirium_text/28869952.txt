28869952|a|BACKGROUND: The risk factors for prevalent delirium in older hospitalised adults in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) remain poorly characterised. METHODS: A total of 510 consecutive admissions of adults aged >=60 years to acute medical wards of Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Centre in northern Tanzania were recruited. Patients were assessed within 24 h of admission with a risk factor questionnaire, physiological observations, neurocognitive assessment, and informant interview. Delirium and dementia diagnoses were made according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM V) and DSM IV respectively, by an expert panel. RESULTS: Being male, current alcohol use, dementia, and physiological markers of illness severity were significant independent risk factors for delirium on multivariable analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The risk factors for prevalent delirium in older medical inpatients in SSA include pre-existing dementia, and are similar to those identified in high-income countries. Our data could help inform the development of a delirium risk stratification tool for older adults in SSA.
