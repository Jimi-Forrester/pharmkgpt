37189663|t|Endothelial Function and Hypoxic-Hyperoxic Preconditioning in Coronary Surgery with a Cardiopulmonary Bypass: Randomized Clinical Trial.
37189663|a|A hypoxic-hyperoxic preconditioning (HHP) may be associated with cardioprotection by reducing endothelial damage and a beneficial effect on postoperative outcome in patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Patients (n = 120) were randomly assigned to an HHP and a control group. A safe, inhaled oxygen fraction for the hypoxic preconditioning phase (10-14% oxygen for 10 min) was determined by measuring the anaerobic threshold. At the hyperoxic phase, a 75-80% oxygen fraction was used for 30 min. The cumulative frequency of postoperative complications was 14 (23.3%) in the HHP vs. 23 (41.1%), p = 0.041. The nitrate decreased after surgery by up to 20% in the HHP group and up to 38% in the control group. Endothelin-1 and nitric oxide metabolites were stable in HHP but remained low for more than 24 h in the control group. The endothelial damage markers appeared to be predictors of postoperative complications. The HHP with individual parameters based on the anaerobic threshold is a safe procedure, and it can reduce the frequency of postoperative complications. The endothelial damage markers appeared to be predictors of postoperative complications.
