34790063|a|Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) remains a significant threat to global health as it induces granuloma and systemic inflammatory responses during active tuberculosis. Mtb can induce macrophage pyroptosis, leading to the release of IL-1beta and tissue damage, promoting its spread. Here, we established an in vitro Mtb-infected macrophage model to seek an effective antipyroptosis agent. Baicalin, isolated from Radix Scutellariae, was found to reduce pyroptosis in Mtb-infected macrophages. Baicalin could inhibit activation of the PERK/eIF2alpha pathway and thus downregulates TXNIP expression and subsequently reduces activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, resulting in reduced pyroptosis in Mtb-infected macrophages. In conclusion, baicalin reduced pyroptosis by inhibiting the PERK/TXNIP/NLRP3 axis and might thus be a new adjuvant host-directed therapy (HDT) drug.
