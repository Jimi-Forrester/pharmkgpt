31483843|a|The incidence of heatstroke has been increasing. Heatstroke has been shown to affect physiological barrier functions. However, there are few studies of the effect of heat stress on the blood-brain barrier (BBB) function. In this study, we investigated the influence of heat stress on brain microvascular endothelial cells in vivo and in vitro. Heatstroke model mice administered Texas Red-dextran showed leakage outside the brain vessel walls. In addition, trans-endothelial electrical resistance (TEER) value was significantly reduced in induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell-derived brain microvascular endothelial cells under heat stress by reducing claudin-5 expression. In addition, our results showed that the expression level of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) was increased in iPS cell-derived brain microvascular endothelial cells under heat stress. Furthermore, serum from heatstroke model mice could impair the BBB integrity of iPS cell-derived brain microvascular endothelial cells. These results suggest that BBB integrity was affected by heat stress in vivo and in vitro and provide important insights into the development of new therapeutic strategies for heatstroke patients.
