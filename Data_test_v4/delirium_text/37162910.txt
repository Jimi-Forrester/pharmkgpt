37162910|t|Differences in AD-related pathology profiles across APOE groups.
37162910|a|BACKGROUND: The apolipoprotein (APOE) e4 allele is a known risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), while the e2 allele is thought to be protective against AD. Few studies have examined the relationship between brain pathologies, atrophy, and white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) and APOE status in those with the e2e4 genotype and results are inconsistent for those with an e2 allele. METHODS: We analyzed Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging participants that had APOE genotyping and at least one of the following metrics: regional WMH load, ventricle size, hippocampal (HC) and entorhinal cortex (EC) volume, amyloid level (i.e., AV-45), and phosphorylated tau (pTau). Participants were divided into one of four APOE allele profiles (E4=e4e4 or e3e4; E2=e2e2 or e2e3; E3=e3e3; or E24=e2e4, Fig.1). Linear mixed models examined the relationship between APOE profiles and each pathology (i.e., regional WMHs, ventricle size, hippocampal and entorhinal cortex volume, amyloid level, and phosphorylated tau measures). while controlling for age, sex, education, and diagnostic status at baseline and over time. RESULTS: APOE epsilon4 is associated with increased pathology while epsilon2 positivity is associated with reduced baseline and lower accumulation of pathologies and rates of neurodegeneration. APOE epsilon2epsilon4 is similar to epsilon4 (increased neurodegeneration) but with a slower rate of change. CONCLUSIONS: The strong associations observed between APOE and pathology in this study show the importance of how genetic factors influence structural brain changes. These findings suggest that epsilon2epsilon4 genotype is related to increased declines associated with the epsilon4 as opposed to the protective effects of the epsilon2. These findings have important implications for initiating treatments and interventions. Given that people who have the epsilon2epsilon4 genotype can expect to have increased atrophy, they must be included (alongside those with an epsilon4 profile) in targeted interventions to reduce brain changes that occur with AD.
