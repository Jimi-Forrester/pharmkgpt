36934558|t|The potential roles of ATF family in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
36934558|a|Activating transcription factors, ATFs, is a family of transcription factors that activate gene expression and transcription by recognizing and combining the cAMP response element binding proteins (CREB). It is present in various viruses as a cellular gene promoter. ATFs is involved in regulating the mammalian gene expression that is associated with various cell physiological processes. Therefore, ATFs play an important role in maintaining the intracellular homeostasis. ATF2 and ATF3 is mostly involved in mediating stress responses. ATF4 regulates the oxidative metabolism, which is associated with the survival of cells. ATF5 is presumed to regulate apoptosis, and ATF6 is involved in the regulation of endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS). ATFs is actively studied in oncology. At present, there has been an increasing amount of research on ATFs for the treatment of neurological diseases. Here, we have focused on the different types of ATFs and their association with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The level of expression of different ATFs have a significant difference in AD patients when compared to healthy control. Recent studies have suggested that ATFs are implicated in the pathogenesis of AD, such as neuronal repair, maintenance of synaptic activity, maintenance of cell survival, inhibition of apoptosis, and regulation of stress responses. In this review, the potential role of ATFs for the treatment of AD has been highlighted. In addition, we have systematically reviewed the progress of research on ATFs in AD. This review will provide a basic and innovative understanding on the pathogenesis and treatment of AD.
