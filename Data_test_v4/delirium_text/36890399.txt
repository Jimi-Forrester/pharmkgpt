36890399|a|OBJECTIVE: Abnormal aggregation of tau in the brain is a major contributing factor in various neurodegenerative diseases. Florzolotau (18F) (florzolotau, APN-1607, PM-PBB3) has been shown to be a probe for tau fibrils in an animal model and patients with Alzheimer's disease and those with non-Alzheimer's disease tauopathies. The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and radiation dose following a single intravenous administration of florzolotau in healthy Japanese subjects. METHODS: Three healthy male Japanese subjects aged between 20 and 64 were enrolled in this study. Subjects were determined to be eligible based on the screening assessments at the study site. Subjects received a single intravenous dose of 195.0 +- 0.5 MBq of florzolotau and underwent the whole-body PET scan 10 times in total to calculate absorbed doses to major organs/tissues and effective dose. Radioactivities in whole blood and urine were also measured for pharmacokinetic evaluation. Absorbed doses to major organs/tissues and effective dose were estimated using the medical internal radiation dose (MIRD) method. Vital signs, electrocardiography (ECG), and blood tests were done for safety evaluation. RESULTS: The intravenous injection of florzolotau was well tolerated. There were no adverse events or clinically detectable pharmacologic effects related to the tracer in any subjects. No significant changes in vital signs and ECG were observed. The highest mean initial uptake at 15 min after injection was in the liver (29.0 +- 4.0%ID), intestine (4.69 +- 1.65%ID), and brain (2.13 +- 0.18%ID). The highest absorbed dose was 508 muGy/MBq of the gallbladder wall, followed by the liver of 79.4 muGy/MBq, the pancreas of 42.5 muGy/MBq, and the upper large intestine of 34.2 muGy/MBq. The effective dose was calculated as 19.7 muSv/MBq according to the tissue weighting factor reported by ICRP-103. CONCLUSION: Florzolotau intravenous injection was well tolerated in healthy male Japanese subjects. The effective dose was determined as 3.61 mSv when 185 MBq florzolotau was given.
