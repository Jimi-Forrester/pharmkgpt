26402626|t|Transcriptomic Analysis of Drosophila Mushroom Body Neurons Lacking Amyloid-beta Precursor-Like Protein Activity.
26402626|a|The amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP) is subjected to sequential intramembrane proteolysis by alpha-, beta-, andgamma-secretases, producing secreted amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides and a cytoplasmically released AbetaPP Intracellular Domain (AICD). AICD complexes with transcription factors in the nucleus, suggesting that this AbetaPP fragment serves as an active signaling effector that regulates downstream genes, although its nuclear targets are poorly defined. To further understand this potential signaling mechanism mediated by AbetaPP, we performed a transcriptomic identification of the Drosophila genome that is regulated by the fly AbetaPP orthologue in fly mushroom body neurons, which control learning- and memory-based behaviors. We find significant changes in expression of 245 genes, representing approximately 1.6% of the Drosophila genome, with the changes ranging from +6 fold to -40 fold. The largest class of responsive targets corresponds to non-protein coding genes and includes microRNAs that have been previously implicated in Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology. Several genes were identified in our Drosophila microarray analyses that have also emerged as putative AbetaPP targets in similar mammalian transcriptomic studies. Our results also indicate a role for AbetaPP in cellular pathways involving the regulation of Drosophila Casein Kinase II, mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, RNA processing, and innate immunity. Our findings provide insights into the intracellular events that are regulated by AbetaPP activity in healthy neurons and that might become dysregulated as a result of abnormal AbetaPP proteolysis in AD.
