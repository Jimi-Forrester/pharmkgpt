37461529|t|Apoer2-ICD-dependent regulation of hippocampal ribosome mRNA loading.
37461529|a|Background ApoE4, the most significant genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD), sequesters a pro-synaptogenic Reelin receptor, Apoer2, in the endosomal compartment and prevents its normal recycling. In the adult brain, Reelin potentiates excitatory synapses and thereby protects against amyloid-beta toxicity. Recently, a gain-of-function mutation in Reelin that is protective against early-onset AD has been described. Alternative splicing of the Apoer2 intracellular domain (Apoer2-ICD) regulates Apoer2 signaling. Splicing of juxtamembraneous exon 16 alters the g-secretase mediated release of the Apoer2-ICD as well as synapse number and LTP, and inclusion of exon 19 ameliorates behavioral deficits in an AD mouse model. The Apoer2-ICD has also been shown to alter transcription of synaptic genes. However, the role of Apoer2 splicing for transcriptional regulation and its role in AD pathogenesis is unknown. Methods To assess in vivo mRNA-primed ribosomes specifically in hippocampi transduced with Apoer2-ICD splice variants, we crossed wild-type, cKO, and Apoer2 cleavage-resistant mice to a Cre-inducible translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) model. This allowed us to perform RNA-Seq on ribosome-loaded mRNA harvested specifically from hippocampal cells transduced with Apoer2-ICDs. Results Across all conditions, we observed ~ 4,700 altered ribosome-associated transcripts, several of which comprise key synaptic components such as extracellular matrix and focal adhesions with concomitant perturbation of critical signaling cascades, energy metabolism, translation, and apoptosis. We further demonstrated the ability of the Apoer2-ICD to rescue many of these altered transcripts, underscoring the importance of Apoer2 splicing in synaptic homeostasis. A variety of these altered genes have been implicated in AD, demonstrating how dysregulated Apoer2 splicing may contribute to neurodegeneration. Conclusions Our findings demonstrate how alternative splicing of the APOE and Reelin receptor Apoer2 and release of the Apoer2-ICD regulates numerous ribosome-associated transcripts in mouse hippocampi in vivo . These transcripts comprise a wide range of functions, and alterations in these transcripts suggest a mechanistic basis for the synaptic deficits seen in Apoer2 mutant mice and AD patients. Our findings, together with the recently reported AD-protective effects of a Reelin gain-of-function mutation in the presence of an early-onset AD mutation in Presenilin-1, implicate the Reelin/Apoer2 pathway as a target for AD therapeutics.
