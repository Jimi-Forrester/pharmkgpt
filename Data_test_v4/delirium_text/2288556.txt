2288556|t|A review of ECT for children and adolescents.
2288556|a|Two cases of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in adolescence are presented and the literature on the use of ECT in childhood and adolescence is reviewed. ECT was effective in children and adolescents with bipolar disorder and depression. Inadequate information exists to make a judgment regarding schizophrenia, delirium, and anorexia nervosa. ECT is not effective in autism and chronic organic brain syndromes. Complications cited include organicity and seizures in the period immediately after ECT, anxiety reactions, and disinhibition. Long-term memory deficit or cognitive impairment has not been found, although further research to rule out residual impairment is needed.
