16572361|a|CASE REPORT: A 37-year-old psychotic patient inflicted injuries to his skin and eyes in the context of an interpretational delirium with aesthetic content. He used magnifying glasses to concentrate sunlight and suffered burns to his arms and face. In the eyes, these resulted in massive iridial atrophy with loss of the sphincteric function, photic maculopathy and peripheral retinal coagulation. The macular lesion resolved spontaneously although he did not recover visual acuity. DISCUSSION: This is the first reported case of ocular self-injury secondary to sunlight. It is also the first case reporting retinal photo-coagulative lesions secondary to sunlight.
