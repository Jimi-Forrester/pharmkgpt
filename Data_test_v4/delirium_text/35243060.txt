35243060|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder. Aluminium chloride induces AD like pathology in rats. Renin angiotensin system plays a significant role in the pathogenesis and occurrence of Alzheimer's disease. In the present study we evaluated and compared the effect of Captopril and Perindopril against aluminium chloride induced amyloidogenesis and cognitive dysfunction in rats. Wistar rats of both sex were divided randomly into four groups i.e. Group I was served as normal control and treated with normal saline, Group II was administered with AlCl3 (100 mg/kg, p. o.) and Group III and IV received Captopril (30 mg/kg, p. o.) and Perindopril (5 mg/kg, p. o.) respectively 1hr prior to administration of AlCl3. All the doses were given once daily for 42 days. The evaluation of memory function was carried out in Y-maze (spontaneous alternation), radial arm maze (number of correct responses) and elevated plus maze (transfer latency). After behavioral studies, estimation of antioxidant status (brain and serum), amyloid-beta content (brain) and histopathology of brain hippocampus region was done. Administration of AlCl3 for 42 days impaired cognitive dysfunction. Captopril and Perindopril prevented AlCl3 induced cognitive dysfunction by improving spontaneous alternation behavior, number of correct responses and reducing transfer latency. They also increase the antioxidant status, reduce the Abeta42 content in the brain and reverse the histopathological changes caused by AlCl3 in hippocampal region. Both Captopril and Perindopril protects against aluminium chloride induced amyloidogenesis and AD like pathology. Captopril is found to be more effective than Perindopril.
