31424413|t|Erythrocytes as Biomarkers for Dementia: Analysis of Protein Content and Alpha-Synuclein.
31424413|a|BACKGROUND: Discovering biomarkers for dementia is a pivotal step toward successful early diagnosis and treatment. Although plasma biomarkers have been explored, no consensus has been reached. Alpha-synuclein (AS), a 14 kDa synaptic protein associated with several neurodegenerative diseases, exists natively within erythrocytes (ERC). This protein is characteristic of Lewy body diseases, in which it aggregates into toxic Lewy bodies. As ERC are implicated in dementia, they are a potential target for future biomarkers. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to assess AS levels within ERC and whether AS can be used as a peripheral biomarker to differentiate between dementia and aged matched healthy control subjects. METHODS: A total of 114 samples (60 aging controls, 36 Alzheimer's disease, 12 vascular dementia (VaD) and 6 dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) subjects) were analyzed. We used Bradford assay to measure protein concentration, indirect ELISA to detect levels of AS, and immunoblotting to identify AS composition. Data were analyzed with nonparametric tests. RESULTS: AS oligomers were present in dementia blood samples, whereas in controls, AS was largely monomeric. There was a significant increase in AS levels in DLB whole blood (p = 0.005; Kruskal-Wallis test), with a sensitivity and specificity of 100.0% and 93.9%. Protein concentrations in ERC isolated at pH 5.7 were significantly increased in dementia patients compared to controls (17.58 versus 40.33mug/ml; p<=0.005; Mann-Whitney test). In the VaD group, the protein concentration in the pH5.7 ERC fraction had sensitivity and specificity of 91.7% and 62.1%. CONCLUSIONS: ERC protein concentration and AS levels have a potential for development of a novel diagnostic dementia blood test.
