38980408|a|For acute ischemic stroke treatment, the limitations of treatment methods and the high incidence of perioperative complications seriously affect the survival rate and postoperative recovery of patients. Human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hucMSCs) have multi-directional differentiation potential and immune regulation function, which is a potential cell therapy. The present investigation involved developing a model of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury by thrombectomy after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 90 min in rats and utilizing comprehensive multi-system evaluation methods, including the detection of brain tissue ischemia, postoperative survival rate, neurological score, anesthesia recovery monitoring, pain evaluation, stress response, and postoperative pulmonary complications, to elucidate the curative effect of tail vein injection of hucMSCs on MCAO's perioperative complications. Based on our research, it has been determined that hucMSCs treatment can reduce the volume of brain tissue ischemia, promote the recovery of neurological function, and improve the postoperative survival rate of MCAO in rats. At the same time, hucMSCs treatment can prolong the time of anesthesia recovery, relieve the occurrence of delirium during anesthesia recovery, and also have a good control effect on postoperative weight loss, facial pain expression, and lung injury. It can also reduce postoperative stress response by regulating blood glucose and serum levels of stress-related proteins including TNF-alpha, IL-6, CRP, NE, cortisol, beta-endorphin, and IL-10, and ultimately promote the recovery of MCAO's perioperative complications.
