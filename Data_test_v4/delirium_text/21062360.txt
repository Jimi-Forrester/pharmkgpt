21062360|a|Amyloid plaques, a well-known hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), are formed by aggregated beta-amyloid (Abeta). The cellular prion protein (PrPc) accumulates concomitantly with Abeta in amyloid plaques. One type of amyloid plaque, classified as a neuritic plaque, is composed of an amyloid core and surrounding dystrophic neurites. PrPc immunoreactivity reminiscent of dystrophic neurites is observed in neuritic plaques. Proteinase K treatment prior to immunohistochemistry removes PrPc immunoreactivity from amyloid plaques, whereas Abeta immunoreactivity is enhanced by this treatment. In the present study, we used a chemical pretreatment by a sarkosyl solution (0.1% sarkosyl, 75 mM NaOH, 2% NaCl), instead of proteinase K treatment, to evaluate PrPc accumulation within amyloid plaques. Since PrPc within amyloid plaques is removed by this chemical pretreatment, we can recognize that the PrP species deposits within amyloid plaques were PrPc. We could observe that PrPc accumulation in dystrophic neurites occurred differently compared with Abeta or hyperphosphorylated tau aggregation in the AD brain. These results could support the hypothesis that PrPc accumulation in dystrophic neurites reflects a response to impairments in cellular degradation, endocytosis, or transport mechanisms associated with AD rather than a non-specific cross-reactivity between PrPc and aggregated Abeta or tau.
