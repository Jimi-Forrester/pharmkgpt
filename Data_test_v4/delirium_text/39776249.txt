39776249|t|Updated appropriate use criteria for amyloid and tau PET: A report from the Alzheimer's Association and Society for Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging Workgroup.
39776249|a|INTRODUCTION: The Alzheimer's Association and the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging convened a multidisciplinary workgroup to update appropriate use criteria (AUC) for amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) and to develop AUC for tau PET. METHODS: The workgroup identified key research questions that guided a systematic literature review on clinical amyloid/tau PET. Building on this review, the workgroup developed 17 clinical scenarios in which amyloid or tau PET may be considered. A modified Delphi approach was used to rate each scenario by consensus as "rarely appropriate," "uncertain," or "appropriate." Ratings were performed separately for amyloid and tau PET as stand-alone modalities. RESULTS: For amyloid PET, seven scenarios were rated as appropriate, two as uncertain, and eight as rarely appropriate. For tau PET, five scenarios were rated as appropriate, six as uncertain, and six as rarely appropriate. DISCUSSION: AUC for amyloid and tau PET provide expert recommendations for clinical use of these technologies in the evolving landscape of diagnostics and therapeutics for Alzheimer's disease. HIGHLIGHTS: A multidisciplinary workgroup convened by the Alzheimer's Association and the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging updated the appropriate use criteria (AUC) for amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) and to develop AUC for tau PET. The goal of these updated AUC is to assist clinicians in identifying clinical scenarios in which amyloid or tau PET may be useful for guiding the diagnosis and management of patients who have, or are at risk for, cognitive decline These updated AUC are intended for dementia specialists who spend a significant proportion of their clinical effort caring for patients with cognitive complaints, as well as serve as a general reference for a broader audience interested in implementation of amyloid and tau PET in clinical practice.
