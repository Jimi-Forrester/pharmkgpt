37108480|t|Bioactive Compounds of the Mediterranean Diet as Nutritional Support to Fight Neurodegenerative Disease.
37108480|a|Neurodegenerative disorders are a widespread cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, characterized by neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and neuronal depletion. They include selective malfunction and progressive loss of neurons, glial cells, and neural networks in the brain and spinal cord. There is an urgent need to develop new and more effective therapeutic strategies to combat these devastating diseases because, today, there is no treatment that can cure degenerative diseases; however, we have many symptomatic treatments. Current nutritional approaches are beginning to reflect a fundamental change in our understanding of health. The Mediterranean diet may have a protective effect on the neurodegenerative process because it is rich in antioxidants, fiber, and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. Increasing knowledge regarding the impact of diet on regulation at the genetic and molecular levels is changing the way we consider the role of nutrition, resulting in new dietary strategies. Natural products, thanks to their bioactive compounds, have recently undergone extensive exploration and study for their therapeutic potential for a variety of diseases. Targeting simultaneous multiple mechanisms of action and a neuroprotection approach with the diet could prevent cell death and restore function to damaged neurons. For these reasons, this review will be focused on the therapeutic potential of natural products and the associations between the Mediterranean-style diet (MD), neurodegenerative diseases, and markers and mechanisms of neurodegeneration.
