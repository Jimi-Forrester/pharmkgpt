36906462|a|INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Critically-ill elderly ICU patients with COVID-19 have poor outcomes. We aimed to compare the rates of in-hospital mortality between non-elderly and elderly critically-ill COVID-19 ventilated patients, as well as to analyze the characteristics, secondary outcomes and independent risk factors associated with in-hospital mortality of elderly ventilated patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a multicentre, observational cohort study including consecutive critically-ill patients admitted to 55 Spanish ICUs due to severe COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation (non-invasive respiratory support [NIRS; include non-invasive mechanical ventilation and high-flow nasal cannula] and invasive mechanical ventilation [IMV]) between February 2020 and October 2021. RESULTS: Out of 5,090 critically-ill ventilated patients, 1,525 (27%) were aged >=70 years (554 [36%] received NIRS and 971 [64%] received IMV. In the elderly group, median age was 74 years (interquartile range 72-77) and 68% were male. Overall in-hospital mortality was 31% (23% in patients <70 years and 50% in those >=70 years; p<0.001). In-hospital mortality in the group >=70 years significantly varied according to the modality of ventilation (40% in NIRS vs. 55% in IMV group; p<0.001). Factors independently associated with in-hospital mortality in elderly ventilated patients were age (sHR 1.07 [95%CI 1.05-1.10], p<0.001); previous admission within the last 30 days (sHR 1.40 [95%CI 1.04-1.89], p = 0.027); chronic heart disease (sHR 1.21 [95%CI 1.01-1.44], p = 0.041); chronic renal failure (sHR 1.43 [95%CI 1.12- 1.82], p = 0.005); platelet count (sHR 0.98 [95% CI 0.98-0.99], p<0.001); IMV at ICU admission (sHR 1.41 [95% CI 1.16- 1.73], p<0.001); and systemic steroids (sHR 0.61 [95%CI 0.48- 0.77], p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Amongst critically-ill COVID-19 ventilated patients, those aged >=70 years presented significantly higher rates of in-hospital mortality than younger patients. Increasing age, previous admission within the last 30 days, chronic heart disease, chronic renal failure, platelet count, IMV at ICU admission and systemic steroids (protective) all comprised independent factors for in-hospital mortality in elderly patients.
