36553795|t|Development and Physico-Chemical Characterization of Healthy Puff Pastry Margarines Made from Olive-Pomace Oil.
36553795|a|Due to its characteristic aroma and flavor, puff pastry (PP) prepared with butter is more accepted than that made with margarine, yet a high saturated fat consumption is associated with cardiovascular disease. This work studies the potential of olive-pomace oil (OPO) as main ingredient of PP margarines together with different organogelator agents to imitate the technological properties of a commercial fatty preparation (CFP). Rheological and textural properties were measured in all formulated margarines (FM) and, additionally, thermal and microstructural properties, and fatty acid (FA) profiles were analyzed in some selected FM. The different FM had viscous modulus (G'') and loss factor (tan delta) values lower than those of CFP, thus reflecting a different viscoelasticity and plasticity. The crystallization and melting temperatures of FM were also different from those of CFP, indicating the presence of a dissimilar polymorphic fat-crystal structure. Nevertheless, the FM containing an oleogel prepared with 5% beeswax and OPO was more similar to CFP. The FA profile of CFP and FM, with 80% polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and 60% oleic acid, is healthier than that of a PP commercial butter (CB), evidencing that, although improvements in margarine plasticity are still necessary, OPO is technologically viable to produce healthier PP margarines.
