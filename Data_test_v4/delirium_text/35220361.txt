35220361|t|Catatonia After COVID-19: A Case Series.
35220361|a|ABSTRACT: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has affected more than a hundred million people worldwide. In addition to the devastating number of deaths caused by this disease, it can cause significant morbidity in some survivors. The understanding of the morbidity associated with COVID-19 is rapidly evolving. This report describes 3 cases of catatonia associated with COVID-19. Catatonia is easily confused with other forms of delirium but if recognized can be effectively treated. We hope that awareness gained from these cases would help clinicians better recognize and diagnose catatonia following COVID-19 infection.
