33833729|t|Kinematic and Clinical Outcomes to Evaluate the Efficacy of a Multidisciplinary Intervention on Functional Mobility in Parkinson's Disease.
33833729|a|Introduction: Functional mobility (FM) is a concept that incorporates the capacity of a person to move independently and safely to accomplish tasks. It has been proposed as a Parkinson's disease (PD) functional and global health outcome. In this study, we aimed to identify which kinematic and clinical outcomes changes better predict FM changes when PD patients are submitted to a specialized multidisciplinary program. Methods: PD patients engaged in a pre-defined specialized multidisciplinary program were assessed at admission and discharge. Change from baseline was calculated for all kinematic and clinical outcomes, and Timed Up and Go (TUG) was defined as the primary outcome for FM. A stepwise multivariate linear regression was performed to identify which outcome measures better predict TUG changes. Results: Twenty-four patients were included in the study. The changes in TUG Cognitive test, supervised step length, and free-living (FL) step time asymmetry were identified as the best predictors of TUG changes. The supervised step length and FL step time asymmetry were able to detect a small to moderate effect of the intervention (d values ranging from -0.26 to 0.42). Conclusions: Our results support the use of kinematic outcome measures to evaluate the efficacy of multidisciplinary interventions on PD FM. The TUG Cognitive, step length, and FL step time asymmetry were identified as having the ability to predict TUG changes. More studies are needed to identify the minimal clinically important difference for step length and FL step time asymmetry in response to a multidisciplinary intervention for PD FM.
