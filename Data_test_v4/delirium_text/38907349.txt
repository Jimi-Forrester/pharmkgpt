38907349|t|The effectiveness of multidisciplinary interventions based on health belief model on musculoskeletal pain in the elderly living in nursing homes: a study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.
38907349|a|BACKGROUND: Due to the burden of musculoskeletal diseases in the elderly and the multifactorial nature of such conditions, controlling the pain caused by these disorders requires multidisciplinary approach. This approach requires the participation of the elderly in applying effective prevention measures. This study aims to design a multidisciplinary educational intervention based on health belief model (HBM) for elderly residents of nursing homes. METHODS: This is a parallel randomized clinical trial among elderly people aged 60 years and over living in a nursing home who suffer from musculoskeletal pain. Eligible participants will be divided into two groups including the intervention group who will receive a multidisciplinary intervention (vitamin D consumption, psycho-social stress management, and physiotherapy) and the control group who will receive usual care. Data collection instruments will include demographic data, the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS), the visual analogue scale (VAS), and a self-designed questionnaire containing the HBM constructs. The interventions will be carried out by the educational team (general practitioner, psychologist, physiotherapist, and health education specialist). Interventions include changing the wrong beliefs of the elderly, taking 800 units of vitamin D daily, daily walking exercise by the elderly for at least 30 min and maintaining proper body posture during daily activities, muscle relaxation, relaxation techniques, regular exercise, examining their diet and eliminating stimulants (such as smoking and coffee), regular visits with friends and family, and deep breathing techniques. All questionnaires will be completed by the elderly before, after, 3, and 6 months after the intervention. DISCUSSION: The present study will evaluate the effect of an educational intervention based on a multifaceted pain control approach for elderly people who reside in nursing homes in order to reduce musculoskeletal pain in the elderly living in nursing homes. One of the features of this study is its focus on improving the health of elderly residents in nursing homes. Given the increase in the elderly population worldwide, the findings from the current trial might benefit elderly populations. TRIAL REGISTRATION: IRCT20220904055881N1 .
