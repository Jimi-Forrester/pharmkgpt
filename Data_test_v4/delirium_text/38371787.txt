38371787|t|Screening Techniques for Drug Discovery in Alzheimer's Disease.
38371787|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive and irreversible impairment of memory and other cognitive functions of the aging brain. Pathways such as amyloid beta neurotoxicity, tau pathogenesis and neuroinflammatory have been used to understand AD, despite not knowing the definite molecular mechanism which causes this progressive disease. This review attempts to summarize the small molecules that target these pathways using various techniques involving high-throughput screening, molecular modeling, custom bioassays, and spectroscopic detection tools. Novel and evolving screening methods developed to advance drug discovery initiatives in AD research are also highlighted.
