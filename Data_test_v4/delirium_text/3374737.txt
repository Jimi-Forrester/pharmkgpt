3374737|a|In the present study we observed enlarged cholinergic processes in the neocortex of aged Fischer 344 rats. These swollen ChAT-positive profiles appeared either as a single axon enlargement or, in many instances, the bulbous processes coalesced to form grape-like clusters of immunoreactivity. The latter structures looked similar to the immunoreactive profiles observed in the cortex of patients with Alzheimer's disease and in the rat septum following fimbria-fornix transection. Together, these data provide evidence that morphologic changes occur within processes of cholinergic neurons in the aged rat. Moreover, the similarity in appearance between the axonal alterations in the aged rat and in patients with Alzheimer's disease suggests a common pathologic process.
