29072103|a|OBJECTIVE: A case of Posterior Cortical Atrophy syndrome of a suspected non-Alzheimer disease pathology type is presented to illustrate prospective diagnosis and course. METHOD: A 54-year-old woman with vague memory complaints underwent serial neuropsychological assessment, MRI, PET, and CSF screening; data are reviewed. RESULTS: While early diagnosis was confounded by multiple factors, classic visuospatial symptoms were later demonstrated using routine neuropsychological methods. Serial MRI, PET, and CSF screening argued strongly for an alternative underlying pathology to AD. At age 59, her condition had progressed to dementia. CONCLUSIONS: Findings underscore the need for further research on suspected non-amyloid-based pathologies.
