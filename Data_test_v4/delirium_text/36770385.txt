36770385|t|Biogenic Selenium Nanoparticles in Biomedical Sciences: Properties, Current Trends, Novel Opportunities and Emerging Challenges in Theranostic Nanomedicine.
36770385|a|Selenium is an important dietary supplement and an essential trace element incorporated into selenoproteins with growth-modulating properties and cytotoxic mechanisms of action. However, different compounds of selenium usually possess a narrow nutritional or therapeutic window with a low degree of absorption and delicate safety margins, depending on the dose and the chemical form in which they are provided to the organism. Hence, selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) are emerging as a novel therapeutic and diagnostic platform with decreased toxicity and the capacity to enhance the biological properties of Se-based compounds. Consistent with the exciting possibilities offered by nanotechnology in the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases, SeNPs are useful tools in current biomedical research with exceptional benefits as potential therapeutics, with enhanced bioavailability, improved targeting, and effectiveness against oxidative stress and inflammation-mediated disorders. In view of the need for developing eco-friendly, inexpensive, simple, and high-throughput biomedical agents that can also ally with theranostic purposes and exhibit negligible side effects, biogenic SeNPs are receiving special attention. The present manuscript aims to be a reference in its kind by providing the readership with a thorough and comprehensive review that emphasizes the current, yet expanding, possibilities offered by biogenic SeNPs in the biomedical field and the promise they hold among selenium-derived products to, eventually, elicit future developments. First, the present review recalls the physiological importance of selenium as an oligo-element and introduces the unique biological, physicochemical, optoelectronic, and catalytic properties of Se nanomaterials. Then, it addresses the significance of nanosizing on pharmacological activity (pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics) and cellular interactions of SeNPs. Importantly, it discusses in detail the role of biosynthesized SeNPs as innovative theranostic agents for personalized nanomedicine-based therapies. Finally, this review explores the role of biogenic SeNPs in the ongoing context of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and presents key prospects in translational nanomedicine.
