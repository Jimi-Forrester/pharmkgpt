32013047|a|Vulvovaginal candidiasis is a common fungal infection in women. In this study, Platonia insignis hydroalcoholic extract (PiHE) and its fractions were evaluated for antifungal and antivirulence activities against vaginal Candida species. Dichloromethane (DCMF) and ethyl acetate fractions (EAF) obtained from PiHE effectively inhibited the pathogen. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry was used for identifying the main compounds in extracts. Minimal inhibitory and fungicidal concentrations (MIC and MFC, respectively) were determined by a broth microdilution assay. Furthermore, we evaluated the effect of the extract and fractions on the virulence properties of Candida albicans, and their cytotoxicity effect was determined on RAW 264.7 cells. Compounds found in extracts were flavonoid glycosides, mainly derivatives of quercetin and myricetin. Extracts showed antifungal potential, with the lowest MIC value for EAF (1.3 mg/mL) and inhibited Candida adherence and biofilm formation. EAF disrupted 48 h biofilms with an inhibition rate of more than 90%. The extract and its fractions exhibited no cytotoxicity. The antifungal effects were attributed to the ability of these extracts to alter the mitochondrial membrane potential for the release of pro-apoptotic factors in the cytosol. In conclusion, our data suggest that PiHE and EAF could act as novel candidates for the development of new therapeutic treatments against fungal infections.
