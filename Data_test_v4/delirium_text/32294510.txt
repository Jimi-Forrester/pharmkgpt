32294510|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common type of dementia, is associated with oxidative stress, inflammation, and gut microbiota (GM) imbalance. Recent studies have demonstrated that camellia oil has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity and modulates the immune system and GM. However, the effect of camellia oil in alleviating AD pathogenesis remains unclear. An SD rat model of cognitive decline was established by the daily oral administration of aluminum chloride. The results revealed that the aluminum chloride-treated group exhibited deteriorated memory capacity and increased expression of AD-related proteins, whereas these features were mitigated in camellia oil-treated groups. Treatment with camellia oil increased antioxidant enzyme levels and decreased MDA levels. Additionally, camellia oil modulated the expression of cytokines by inhibiting RAGE/NF-kappaB signaling and microglial activation. Interestingly, autophagy-related proteins were increased in the camellia oil-treated groups. Moreover, camellia oil increased the abundance of probiotics in the GM. Camellia oil can reverse AD brain pathology by alleviating deficits in memory, increasing learning capacity, increasing antioxidant activity, modulating the expression of immune-related cytokines, enhancing autophagy and improving the composition of GM in aluminum chloride-treated rats, implying that AD pathogenesis may be mitigated by treatment with camellia oil through the microbiome-gut-brain axis.
