37687313|t|The Impact and Invasive Mechanisms of Pueraria montana var. lobata, One of the World's Worst Alien Species.
37687313|a|Pueraria montana var. lobata is native to East Asia, and was introduced to many countries due to its potential for multiple uses. This species escaped under the management conditions soon after its introduction, and became a harmful weed species. This species has been listed in the top 100 of the world's worst invasive alien species. P. montana stands expand quickly and threaten the native flora and fauna including microbiota. This species affects the concentration of carbon and nitrogen in soil and aquatic environments, and increases the amount of pollutants in the local atmosphere. Its infestation also causes serious economic losses on forestry and agriculture. Its characteristics of fast growth, thick canopy structure, enormous vegetative reproduction, and adaptative ability to the various environmental conditions may contribute to the invasiveness and naturalization of this species. The characteristics of P. montana regarding their defense functions against their natural enemies and pathogens, and allelopathy may also contribute to the invasiveness of this species. Potential allelochemicals such as xanthoxins, p-coumaric acid, caffeic acid, methyl caffeate and daidzein, and two isoflavones with anti-virus activity were identified in this species. In addition, fewer herbivore insects were found in the introduced ranges. These characteristics of P. montana may be involved in the invasive mechanisms of the species. This is the first review article focusing on the invasive mechanisms of this species.
