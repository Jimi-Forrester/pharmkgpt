38260583|a|Background: To date, there is no high throughput proteomic study in the context of Autosomal Dominant Alzheimer's disease (ADAD). Here, we aimed to characterize early CSF proteome changes in ADAD and leverage them as potential biomarkers for disease monitoring and therapeutic strategies. Methods: We utilized Somascan  7K assay to quantify protein levels in the CSF from 291 mutation carriers (MCs) and 185 non-carriers (NCs). We employed a multi-layer regression model to identify proteins with different pseudo-trajectories between MCs and NCs. We replicated the results using publicly available ADAD datasets as well as proteomic data from sporadic Alzheimer's disease (sAD). To biologically contextualize the results, we performed network and pathway enrichment analyses. Machine learning was applied to create and validate predictive models. Findings: We identified 125 proteins with significantly different pseudo-trajectories between MCs and NCs. Twelve proteins showed changes even before the traditional AD biomarkers (Abeta42, tau, ptau). These 125 proteins belong to three different modules that are associated with age at onset: 1) early stage module associated with stress response, glutamate metabolism, and mitochondria damage; 2) the middle stage module, enriched in neuronal death and apoptosis; and 3) the presymptomatic stage module was characterized by changes in microglia, and cell-to-cell communication processes, indicating an attempt of rebuilding and establishing new connections to maintain functionality. Machine learning identified a subset of nine proteins that can differentiate MCs from NCs better than traditional AD biomarkers (AUC>0.89). Interpretation: Our findings comprehensively described early proteomic changes associated with ADAD and captured specific biological processes that happen in the early phases of the disease, fifteen to five years before clinical onset. We identified a small subset of proteins with the potentials to become therapy-monitoring biomarkers of ADAD MCs. Funding: Proteomic data generation was supported by NIH: RF1AG044546.
