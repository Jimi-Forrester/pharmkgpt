33858356|a|BACKGROUND: People living with dementia seem to be more likely to experience delirium following hip fracture. The association between mental disorders (MD) and hip fracture remains controversial. We conducted a nationwide study to examine the prevalence of MD in geriatric patients with hip fractures undergoing surgery and conducted a related risk factor analysis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This retrospective cohort study used data from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database between 2000 and 2012 and focused on people who were older than 60 years. Patients with hip fracture undergoing surgical intervention and without hip fracture were matched at a ratio of 1:1 for age, sex, comorbidities, and index year. The incidence and hazard ratios of age, sex, and multiple comorbidities related to MD and its subgroups were calculated using Cox proportional hazards regression models. RESULTS: A total of 1408 patients in the hip fracture group and a total of 1408 patients in the control group (no fracture) were included. The overall incidence of MD for the hip fracture and control groups per 100 person-years were 0.8 and 0.5, respectively. Among MD, the incidences of transient MD, depression, and dementia were significantly higher in the hip fracture group than in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of newly developed MD, especially transient MD, depression, and dementia, was higher in the geriatric patients with hip fracture undergoing surgery than that in the control group. Prompt and aggressive prevention protocols and persistent follow-up of MD development is highly necessary in this aged society.
