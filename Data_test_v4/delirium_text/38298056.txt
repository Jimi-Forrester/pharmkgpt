38298056|a|Voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1) is a pore protein located in the outer mitochondrial membrane. Its channel gating mediates mitochondrial respiration and cell metabolism, and it has been identified as a critical modulator of mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. In many diseases characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction, such as cancer and neurodegenerative diseases, VDAC1 is considered a promising potential therapeutic target. However, there is limited research on the regulatory factors involved in VDAC1 protein expression in both normal and pathological states. In this study, we find that VDAC1 protein expression is up-regulated in various neuronal cell lines in response to intracellular metabolic and oxidative stress. We further demonstrate that VDAC1 expression is modulated by intracellular ATP level. Through the use of pharmacological agonists and inhibitors and small interfering RNA (siRNA), we reveal that the AMPK/PGC-1alpha signaling pathway is involved in regulating VDAC1 expression. Additionally, based on bioinformatics predictions and biochemical verification, we identify p53 as a potential transcription factor that regulates VDAC1 promoter activity during metabolic oxidative stress. Our findings suggest that VDAC1 expression is regulated by the AMPK/PGC-1alpha and p53 pathways, which contributes to the maintenance of stress adaptation and apoptotic homeostasis in neuronal cells.
