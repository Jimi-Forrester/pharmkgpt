36616160|t|"Cow's Hoof" (Bauhinia L., Leguminosae): A Review on Pharmacological Properties of Austral South American Species.
36616160|a|The genus Bauhinia s.l. (Leguminosae), known as cow's hoof, unha de boi or pata de vaca, has been used in traditional medicine worldwide. The aim of the present review is to summarize the studies published on the biological activity of the main native medicinal species reported in austral South America. Of the 14 species present in the region, 10 are consumed as leaf infusions to regulate glucose and lipid metabolism, as well as used for their anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects and to treat various diseases. Pharmacological properties have been recorded in seven species. Antioxidant, anticoagulant, antihypertensive, diuretic, antimicrobial and antitumor properties have been reported in B. forficata. Together with B. holophylla, they are important for their antidiabetic properties, since several studies indicate their effectiveness as a hypoglycemic agent. B. bauhinioides is distinguished for its anti-inflammatory and antithrombotic activities and S. microstachya for its analgesic properties. Anti-ulcer and wound healing activities recorded in B. holophylla and B. ungulata, respectively, are of particular interest. Most of the species possess antitumor activity. The antioxidant capacity of flavonoids and other bioactive compounds make these plants good candidates to assist or treat various alterations related with oxidative stress, such as diabetic complications. Thus, these species constitute promising targets for new bioactive substance research and phytotherapy.
