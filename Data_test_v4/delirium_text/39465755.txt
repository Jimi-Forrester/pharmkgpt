39465755|t|Association between glaucoma and the risk of Alzheimer's disease: A meta-analysis.
39465755|a|BACKGROUND: The role of glaucoma in predicting Alzheimer's disease (AD) factors is unknown. This current meta-analysis was aimed at evaluating the risk of AD events in individuals suffering from glaucoma based on a meta-analysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Databases which included Cochrane Library, PubMed, and EMBASE were searched to detect the relevant articles, with language being restricted to English. The risk of AD events in patients with glaucoma was analyzed using the combined hazard ratios. RESULTS: This study included 8 articles with 131,987 subjects published after 2012. We identified glaucoma as the risk factor for disease-free survival (hazard ratio = 1.29; 95% confidence interval = 1.05-1.59; P = .000; I2 = 95.1%) in AD patients. According to subgroup analyses, normal tension glaucoma group was the major risk factor for disease-free survival of AD patients. CONCLUSIONS: Although diverse approaches have been used for AD cases of various events, the current meta-analysis indicates that that glaucoma patients have a higher AD risk.
