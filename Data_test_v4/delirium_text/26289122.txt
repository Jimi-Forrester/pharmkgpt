26289122|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. It is characterized by beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptide fibrils, which are extracellular depositions of a specific protein, and is accompanied by extensive neuroinflammation. Various studies have demonstrated risk factors that can affect AD pathogenesis, and they include accumulation of Abeta, hyperphosphorylation of tau protein, and neuroinflammation. Among these detrimental factors, neuroinflammation has been highlighted by epidemiologic studies suggesting that use of anti-inflammatory drugs could significantly reduce the incidence of AD. Evidence suggests that astrocytes, microglia, and infiltrating immune cells from periphery might contribute to or modify the process of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in AD brains. In addition, recent data indicate that microRNAs may affect neuroinflammatory responses in the brain. This article focuses on supportive evidence that neuroinflammation plays a critical role in AD development. In addition, we depict putative therapeutic capacity of anti-inflammatory drugs for AD prevention or treatment. We also discuss pathogenic mechanisms by which astrocytes, microglia, T cells and microRNA participate in AD and the neuroprotective mechanisms of anti-inflammatory drugs.
