37635370|a|OBJECTIVES: Health literacy (HL) about healthy cognitive aging is essential in preventing cognitive decline and promoting cognitive well-being. It is important that one such HL module should be scientifically designed, delivered in a technically sound manner to the audience, and specific to the context. The present study thus aimed at developing and validating educational multimedia about cognitive health. METHODS: The study followed a methodological framework and was carried out across three phases, that is, identification of themes, development and validation of educational script and design, and validation of educational multimedia. The module was scripted based on the Integrated HL framework and the recommendations made during the modified nominal group technique among the research team. Seven speech-language pathologists (SLPs), with expertise in the field of cognitive sciences, and 15 representatives of the general public validated the module using the Educational Content Validation Instrument in Health and the Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool for Audiovisual Materials questionnaire. RESULTS: The scientific content of the educational script received satisfactory agreements among the experts (content validity index [CVI]: 0.93) and representatives of the general public (CVI: 0.86). The technical aspects of the educational multimedia were rated to have high understandability (experts: 92.8%; representatives of general public: 98.8%) and actionability (experts and representatives of general public 100%). CONCLUSION: Overall, the developed educational multimedia scored optimally with respect to the objective, structure, relevance of the content, actionability and understandability of the multimedia. The developed module holds the potential to be used at community and national level health educational programs or awareness campaigns to enhance public knowledge and beliefs pertaining to cognitive health. PATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: SLPs with expertise in the field of cognitive science and representatives from the general public were included to validate and obtain feedback on the developed educational multimedia.
