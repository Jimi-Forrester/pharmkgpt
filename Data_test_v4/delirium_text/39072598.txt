39072598|a|BACKGROUND: To date delirium prevalence in the adult acute Italian hospital cardiac population is unknown. In a multicenter study, we assessed the prevalence of delirium over a single day among a population of patients admitted to acute cardiac hospital wards in Italy. METHODS: This is a point prevalence study (called "Cardio Delirium Day") which involved 55 Italian cardiologic centers (23 North, 18 Central, 12 South, 2 Sardinia) that collected data on 152 patients older than 65 years hospitalized on March 15, 2023. Delirium was assessed on the same day in all patients using the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit algorithm, a validated and briefly administered tool which does not require specialized training. We also collected data about clinical variables, functional and nutritional status, dementia, comorbidity, medications, and physical restraints. RESULTS: The mean sample age was 79.0 +- 10 years (33% female). Delirium was diagnosed in 25 patients (16.4%); 17.1% were hospitalized in the intensive cardiac care unit and 13.8% in the cardiology ward (p=NS). Hyperactive was the commonest subtype (48%), followed by mixed (36%) and hypoactive type (8%). In a multivariate logistic regression, male sex (odds ratio [OR] 3.81, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.18-12.26; p=0.025), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR 0.24, 95% CI 0.063-0.66; p=0.008), sensorial deficit (OR 3.75, 95% CI 1.18-11.95; p=0.025), sleep deprivation (OR 5.81, 95% CI 1.47-22.9; p=0.012) and the presence of >=3 precipitating factors (OR 7.63, 95% CI 2.32-25.2; p=0.001) were independent predictors of delirium. CONCLUSIONS: Delirium occurred in 16.4% of patients in a cardiology setting. The "Cardio Delirium Day" project might become a useful method to assess delirium over time and sensitize the interest and the culture of Italian cardiology in this important aspect of hospital care.
