38680505|a|Cerebral organoids have emerged as a powerful tool for mirroring the brain developmental processes and replicating its unique physiology. This bibliometric analysis aims to delineate the burgeoning trends in the application of cerebral organoids in disease research and offer insights for future investigations. We screened all relevant literature from the Web of Science on cerebral organoids in disease research during the period 2013-2022 and analyzed the research trends in the field using VOSviewer, CiteSpace, and Scimago Graphica software. According to the search strategy, 592 articles were screened out. The United States of America (USA) was the most productive, followed by China and Germany. The top nine institutions in terms of the number of publications include Canada and the United States, with the University of California, San Diego (USA), having the highest number of publications. The International Journal of Molecular Sciences was the most productive journal. Knoblich, Juergen A., and Lancaster, Madeline A. published the highest number of articles. Keyword cluster analysis showed that current research trends focused more on induced pluripotent stem cells to construct organoid models of cerebral diseases and the exploration of their mechanisms and therapeutic modalities. This study provides a comprehensive summary and analysis of global research trends in the field of cerebral organoids in diseases. In the past decade, the number of high-quality papers in this field has increased significantly, and cerebral organoids provide hope for simulating nervous system diseases (such as Alzheimer's disease).
