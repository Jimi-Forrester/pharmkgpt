32618419|t|An in vitro model for hypertrophic adipocytes: Time-dependent adipocyte proteome and secretome changes under high glucose and high insulin conditions.
32618419|a|Obesity is the consequence of a positive energy balance and characterized by enlargement of the adipose tissue, which in part is due to hyperplasia and hypertrophy of the adipocytes. Not much is known about the transition of normal mature adipocytes to the hypertrophic state, which in vivo is very hard to study. Here, we have maintained mature human SGBS cells as a surrogate for adipocytes, changes of morphological and molecular metabolism of the adipocytes were monitored over the first 4 days and the last 4 days. In total, 393 cellular proteins and 246 secreted proteins were identified for further analysis. During the first 4 days of high glucose and insulin, the adipocytes seemed to prefer pyruvate as energy source, whereas beta-oxidation was down-regulated supporting lipid loading. Over time, lipid droplet fusion instead of lipid uptake became relatively important for growth of lipid droplets during the last 4 days. Moreover, ECM production shifted towards ECM turnover by the up-regulation of proteases over eight days. The present in vitro system provides insight into the metabolic changes of adipocytes under conditions of high glucose and insulin, which may help to understand the process of in vivo adipocyte hypertrophy during the development of obesity.
