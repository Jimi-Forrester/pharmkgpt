38515991|a|Objectives: To introduce the first case in which primary progressive apraxia of speech (PPAOS) is associated with TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) instead of 4-repeat tau. Methods: This patient was identified through a postmortem autopsy. Following an initial diagnostic evaluation, he participated in 3 annual research visits during which speech, language, cognitive, and neurologic assessments were administered. Neuroimaging was also acquired. Results: Apraxia of speech was diagnosed at his initial visit with a comprehensive neurologic examination further revealing subtle motor findings in the right hand. At subsequent visits, agrammatic aphasia and motor symptoms consistent with corticobasal syndrome were evident. Cognition and behavior remained relatively intact until advanced stages. FDG-PET revealed hypometabolism in the right temporoparietal cortex and left premotor and motor cortices. There was also low-level signal in the right temporoparietal cortex on tau-PET. A sequence variation in the progranulin gene was identified (GRN c.1A>C, p.Met1). Pathologic diagnosis was TDP-43 Type A with an atypical distribution of inclusions in premotor and motor cortices. Discussion: This case report demonstrates that TDP-43 Type A inclusions in an atypical distribution can present clinically as PPAOS. The sequence variation in the progranulin gene and asymmetric temporoparietal cortex involvement were the strongest indications of the unusual neuropathophysiology prior to autopsy.
