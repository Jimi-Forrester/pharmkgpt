25771843|a|BACKGROUND: Postoperative delirium (PD) is a common but serious problem after major surgery with a multifactorial pathogenesis including age, pain, opioid use, sleep disturbances and the surgical stress response. These factors have been minimised by the "fast-track methodology" previously demonstrated to enhance recovery and reduce morbidity. METHODS: Clinical symptoms of PD were routinely collected three times daily from preoperatively until discharge in a well-defined enhanced recovery program after colonic surgery in 247 consecutive patients. RESULTS: Total median length of hospital stay was 3 days. Seven patients (2.8%) developed clinical signs of PD most within the first 72 postoperative hours and only 1 patient with PD extending to 120 h postoperatively. Only 1 PD patient required treatment with serenase. PD patients were older (83 vs. 73 years) and had longer median stay (6 vs. 3 days). No difference in development of PD between open and laparoscopic operation could be demonstrated. Among the 7 patients with PD, 3 of these patients had later surgical complications. One patient had a subsequent strangulated small intestine, another an anastomotic leakage complicated by a bleeding gastric ulcer and death on day 12 and 1 with fever, abdominal pain and suspected but disproven anastomotic leakage (stay 21, 12 and 22 days, respectively). The remaining 4 PD patients stayed 4, 4, 5 and 6 days with an uncomplicated course. CONCLUSIONS: These data support that an enhanced postoperative recovery program may decrease the risk and duration of PD after colonic surgery.
