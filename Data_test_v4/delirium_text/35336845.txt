35336845|t|Physiological Response to Thermal Stress in Obese vs. Non-Obese Physically Inactive Men.
35336845|a|The effects of thermal stress on the physiological parameters of obese subjects remain insufficiently researched. The objective of this study was to determine the influence of sauna bathing on the physiological parameters of obese and non-obese physically inactive men. Sixty volunteers aged 18-24 years (20.85 +- 1.46) were divided into two groups (group I:normal body mass, group II:class 1 obesity) for a comparative analysis. Somatic features and body composition were determined before sauna, and blood pressure was measured before and after sauna. Physiological parameters were monitored before and during the sauna session. The average values of body mass, body mass index, body surface area, and weight-to-height ratio were significantly higher (p < 0.001) in obese men (by 28.39 kg, 8.7 kg/m2, 0.34 m2, and 0.13, respectively) than in the normal weight group. Similar observations were made in an analysis of the remaining body composition parameters. The values of physiological parameters (heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, energy expenditure, oxygen uptake, excess post-exercise oxygen consumption, respiratory rate) were significantly (p < 0.001) higher in obese subjects. However, the observed physiological changes were within the expected norm; therefore, a 10 min sauna session is safe for young men regardless of their body fat levels.
