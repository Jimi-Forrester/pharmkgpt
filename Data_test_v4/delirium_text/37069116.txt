37069116|t|Electrochemical Analysis in Studying beta-Amyloid Aggregation.
37069116|a|beta-amyloid (Abeta) is comprised of a group of peptides formed as a result of cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein by secretases. Abeta aggregation is considered as a central event in pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, the most common human neurodegenerative disorder. Molecular mechanisms of Abeta aggregation have intensively being investigated using synthetic Abeta peptides by methods based on monitoring of aggregates, including determination of their size and structure. In this review, an orthogonal approach to the study of Abeta aggregation is considered, which relies on electrochemical registration of the loss of peptide monomers. Electrochemical analysis of Abeta (by voltammetry and amperometric flow injection analysis) is based on registration of the oxidation signal of electroactive amino acid residues of the peptide on an electrode surface. The Abeta oxidation signal disappears, when the peptide is included in the aggregate. The advantages and disadvantages of electrochemical analysis for the study of spontaneous and metal-induced aggregation of Abeta, comparative analysis of various peptide isoforms, and study of the process of complexation of metal ions with the metal-binding domain of Abeta are discussed. It is concluded that the combined use of the electrochemical method and the methods based on detection of Abeta aggregates makes it possible to obtain more complete information about the mechanisms of peptide aggregation.
