36386369|a|Research on the association between level of depression and coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke risk, and all-cause and cardiovascular mortality is lacking in large-scale or population-based studies incorporating cardiovascular disease (CVD) endpoints. We aim to assess the relationship between the level of a person's depression and their risk of CHD, stroke, and all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. Utilizing data from the United States National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), multicycle cross-sectional design and mortality linkage studies were conducted. The study sample included 30918 participants aged 20-85 years old during the 2005-2018 period. Depression was assessed using the nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), with scores of 5, 10, 15, and 20 being the cut-off points for mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe depression, respectively. A series of weighted logistic regression analyses and Cox proportional hazards models were utilized to examine the relationship between the level of depression with the risk of CHD, stroke, all-cause, and cardiovascular mortality. Trend analyses were conducted by entering the level of depression as a continuous variable and rerunning the corresponding regression models. Weighted logistic regression models consistently indicated a statistically significant association between the level of depression and increased risk of CHD and stroke, and those linear trend tests were statistically significant (P for trend < 0.001). Furthermore, weighted Cox regression analyses consistently indicated that participants who had a more severe degree of depression were at a higher risk of all-cause death, and trend analyses suggested similar results (P for trend < 0.001). Another weighted Cox regression analysis also consistently indicated that except for severe depression, the hazard of cardiovascular death was increased with each additional level increase of depression. Our study confirmed that the level of depression was strongly associated with CHD, stroke, and all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, even after accounting for other factors that could impact risk, including variables of age, gender, ethnicity, income, education, body mass index (BMI), marital, and smoking status.
