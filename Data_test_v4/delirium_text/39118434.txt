39118434|a|OBJECTIVES: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and subjective cognitive decline (SCD) are independent risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia, but the association of their interaction on AD biomarkers have yet to be characterized. This study aimed to examine the impact of PTSD on the association between SCD and tau and amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) as well as global cognition in older Veterans. METHOD: This study included 87 Vietnam-Era Veterans without dementia (42 with PTSD; 45 without PTSD) from the Department of Defense-Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. All participants had both tau and amyloid PET imaging as well as cognitive testing. SCD was measured using the Everyday Cognition questionnaire. RESULTS: While SCD was associated with tau PET, amyloid PET, and global cognition, PTSD moderated these associations for tau and amyloid PET levels. Specifically, Veterans without PTSD had a stronger positive relationship between SCD and AD biomarkers when compared to those with PTSD. CONCLUSION: Higher SCD was associated with greater tau and amyloid burden and worse cognitive performance across the sample, though the tau and amyloid associations were stronger for Veterans without PTSD. Results highlight the potential benefit of comprehensive clinical assessments including consideration of mental health among older Veterans with SCD to understand the underlying cause of the cognitive concerns. Additionally, more work is needed to understand alternative mechanisms driving SCD in older Veterans with PTSD.
