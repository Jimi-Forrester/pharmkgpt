20399652|t|Macrocyclic BACE inhibitors: Optimization of a micromolar hit to nanomolar leads.
20399652|a|We have identified macrocyclic inhibitors of the aspartic protease BACE, implicated in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease. An X-ray structure of screening hit 1 in the BACE active site revealed a hairpin conformation suggesting that constrained macrocyclic derivatives may also bind there. Several of the analogs we prepared were >100x more potent than 1, such as 7 (5 nM K(i)).
