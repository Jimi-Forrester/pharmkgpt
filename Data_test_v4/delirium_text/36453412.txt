36453412|a|Dysfunction of neuronal nitric oxide synthase contributes to neurotoxicity, which triggers cell death in various neuropathological diseases, including epilepsy. Studies have shown that inhibition of neuronal nitric oxide synthase activity increases the epilepsy threshold, that is, has an anticonvulsant effect. However, the exact role and potential mechanism of neuronal nitric oxide synthase in seizures are still unclear. In this study, we performed RNA sequencing, functional enrichment analysis, and weighted gene coexpression network analysis of the hippocampus of tremor rats, a rat model of genetic epilepsy. We found damaged hippocampal mitochondria and abnormal succinate dehydrogenase level and Na+-K+-ATPase activity. In addition, we used a pilocarpine-induced N2a cell model to mimic epileptic injury. After application of neuronal nitric oxide synthase inhibitor 7-nitroindazole, changes in malondialdehyde, lactate dehydrogenase and superoxide dismutase, which are associated with oxidative stress, were reversed, and the increase in reactive oxygen species level was reversed by 7-nitroindazole or reactive oxygen species inhibitor N-acetylcysteine. Application of 7-nitroindazole or N-acetylcysteine downregulated the expression of caspase-3 and cytochrome c and reversed the apoptosis of epileptic cells. Furthermore, 7-nitroindazole or N-acetylcysteine downregulated the abnormally high expression of NLRP3, gasdermin-D, interleukin-1beta and interleukin-18. This indicated that 7-nitroindazole and N-acetylcysteine each reversed epileptic cell death. Taken together, our findings suggest that the neuronal nitric oxide synthase/reactive oxygen species pathway is involved in pyroptosis of epileptic cells, and inhibiting neuronal nitric oxide synthase activity or its induced oxidative stress may play a neuroprotective role in epilepsy.
