38877722|a|BACKGROUND: Massage and aromatherapy are frequently used by older adults as alternative interventions to enhance immunity and induce relaxation. This pilot study evaluated the effect of massage therapy with oil and aromatherapy alone and in combination using objective biological indices. METHODS: Twenty-eight participants recruited by convenience sampling included adults aged between 25 and 65 years (Group 1), elderly individuals over 65 years without nursing care (Group 2), and older adults over 65 needing long-term nursing support (Group 3). A multiple-group pretest-post-test design was employed, and the effect among the three groups was compared. Interventions included: (i) oil massage therapy; (ii) aromatherapy; and (iii) aroma oil massage therapy. Each therapy session lasted 5 min, with 3 min of observation before and after the session and 10 min interval between sessions. Group 3 omitted one therapy (2: aromatherapy) to reduce their physical burden. An electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded for alpha, beta, and theta activities of brain waves. EEG data were collected at three points: before, during, and after each treatment. Salivary secretory immunoglobulin A (s-IgA) concentration, oxygen saturation (SPO2), and pulse rate were measured before and after each session. RESULTS: Across all therapy modalities, there was a noticeable increase in the alpha wave, indicative of relaxation, during the treatment. Significant differences were observed before and during the oil massage in both Group 1 and Group 2. Aromatherapy demonstrated a significant difference before and during treatment in Group 1. Among the biological parameters, s-IgA levels indicated no significant changes. The pulse rate decreased with oil massage. Significant differences were noted before and after therapy in all cases for SPO2 and in Group 2 for pulse rate. CONCLUSIONS: Three therapies induced EEG and physiological changes in the adult group and older adults without nursing care. However, these effects are limited in older adults requiring nursing care.
