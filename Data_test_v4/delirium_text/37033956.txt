37033956|a|Introduction: Clusterin is a moonlighting protein that has many functions. It is a multifunctional holdase chaperone glycoprotein that is present intracellularly and extracellularly in almost all bodily fluids. Clusterin is involved in lipid transport, cell differentiation, regulation of apoptosis, and clearance of cellular debris, and plays a protective role in ensuring cellular survival. However, the possible involvement of clusterin in arthritic disease remains unclear. Given the significant potential of clusterin as a biomarker of osteoarthritis (OA), a more detailed analysis of its complex network in an inflammatory environment, specifically in the context of OA, is required. Based on the molecular network of clusterin, this study aimed to identify interacting partners that could be developed into biomarker panels for OA. Methods: The STRING database and Cytoscape were used to map and visualize the clusterin connectome. The Qiagen Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software was used to analyze and study clusterin associated signaling networks in OA. We also analyzed transcription factors known to modulate clusterin expression, which may be altered in OA. Results: The top hits in the clusterin network were intracellular chaperones, aggregate-forming proteins, apoptosis regulators and complement proteins. Using a text-mining approach in Cytoscape, we identified additional interacting partners, including serum proteins, apolipoproteins, and heat shock proteins. Discussion: Based on known interactions with proteins, we predicted potential novel components of the clusterin connectome in OA, including selenoprotein R, semaphorins, and meprins, which may be important for designing new prognostic or diagnostic biomarker panels.
