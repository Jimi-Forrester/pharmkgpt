36419116|a|BACKGROUND: This study investigated the knowledge and attitude of surgical ward nurses toward patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) to develop educational material for nurses on the use of PCA. METHODS: This study was a cross-sectional study comprising 120 nurses from eight surgical wards in a tertiary hospital in South Korea. A questionnaire addressing 6 domains of knowledge of and attitudes towards PCA was conducted over 1 week and analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistical methods. Knowledge was measured on a categorical scale of 0 and 1 (20 points), and attitude was measured on a Likert scale of 1 to 4 points (60 points). RESULTS: The total score quantifying the knowledge of and attitudes toward PCA of surgical ward nurses was 59.5 +- 5.5 out of 80.0 points. The average age of the subjects was 28.58 +- 5.68 years old, and nurses above the age of 28 had significantly greater knowledge and better attitudes (61.7 +- 5.5) than those below the age of 28 (57.9 +- 4.9) (p < .001). Nurses working on the upper abdominal surgical ward had significantly greater knowledge (16.2 +- 1.9) than nurses working on other wards (thorax: 14.0 +- 2.3, lower abdominal: 15.4 +- 1.9, and musculoskeletal: 14.5 +- 2.2) (p = .001). Nurses who received education about PCA had significantly better attitudes (45.3 +- 4.6) than those who did not (41.3 +- 3.5) (p < .001). The average correct answer rate for knowledge of opioid analgesics was lower (68.2%) than that for knowledge of the basic configuration of PCA equipment (73.3%) and areas to be identified and managed when using PCA (84.6%), and there was a significant correlation with attitudes toward side effect management (p < .05, r = .19). CONCLUSIONS: There was a significant correlation between the knowledge and attitude of nurses regarding opioid use in PCA. Older nurses with greater clinical experience on the surgical wards who had received PCA education had a better attitude toward PCA. Therefore, newly trained nurses on surgical wards with no experience of PCA education should undergo an intensive education program on opioid analgesics used in PCA.
