36606272|a|It is widely recognized that Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common type of progressive neurodegenerative disorder that results in cognitive impairment over time. Approximately 152 million cases of AD are predicted to be reported by 2050. Amyloid plaques and tau proteins are two major hallmarks of AD which can be seen under electron microscope. Mitochondria plays a vital role in the pathogenesis of AD and mitochondria disruption leads to mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) dysfunction, alteration of mitochondria dependent Ca2+ homeostasis, copper dysfunction, immune cell dysfunction, etc. In this review, we try to cover all the mechanisms related with mitochondrial dysfunction and mitochondrial pathogenesis that may help us to better understand AD as well as open a new era for therapeutic target of AD and treat this progressive disease.
