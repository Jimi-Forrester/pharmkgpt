38562672|a|Nanotechnology is revolutionising different areas from manufacturing to therapeutics in the health field. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), a promising drug candidate in nanomedicine, have attracted attention due to their excellent and unique mechanical, electronic, and physicochemical properties. This emerging nanomaterial has attracted a wide range of scientific interest in the last decade. Carbon nanotubes have many potential applications in cancer therapy, such as imaging, drug delivery, and combination therapy. Carbon nanotubes can be used as carriers for drug delivery systems by carrying anticancer drugs and enabling targeted release to improve therapeutic efficacy and reduce adverse effects on healthy tissues. In addition, carbon nanotubes can be combined with other therapeutic approaches, such as photothermal and photodynamic therapies, to work synergistically to destroy cancer cells. Carbon nanotubes have great potential as promising nanomaterials in the field of nanomedicine, offering new opportunities and properties for future cancer treatments. In this paper, the main focus is on the application of carbon nanotubes in cancer diagnostics, targeted therapies, and toxicity evaluation of carbon nanotubes at the biological level to ensure the safety and real-life and clinical applications of carbon nanotubes.
