38252194|t|Intraoperative electroencephalogram features related to frailty in older patients: an exploratory prospective observational study.
38252194|a|Frailty is an independent risk factor for the increased incidence of postoperative delirium (POD). To date, the effect of frailty on intraoperative electroencephalogram (EEG) changes remains unexplored. The present study, an exploratory analysis of a prospective cohort study, aimed to investigate the differences in EEG characteristics between frail and robust patients. This prospective observational study was conducted between December 2020 and November 2021. The preoperative frailty status was assessed using the FRAIL scale. The patients' baseline (before anesthesia) and intraoperative EEG data were collected using a brain function monitor. Finally, 20 robust and 26 frail older patients scheduled for elective spinal surgery or transurethral prostatectomy under propofol-based general anesthesia were included in the final analysis. Baseline and intraoperative EEG spectrogram and power spectra were compared between the frail and robust groups. No differences were observed in baseline EEG between the frail and robust groups. When the intraoperative EEG spectral parameters were compared, the alpha peak frequency (10.56 +- 0.49 vs. 10.14 +- 0.36 Hz, P = 0.002) and alpha peak, delta, theta, alpha, and beta powers were lower in the frail group. After adjusting for age, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), and mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score, the FRAIL score was still negatively associated with total, delta, theta, alpha, and beta powers. Frail patients had reduced EEG (0-30 Hz) power after the induction of propofol-based general anesthesia. After adjusting for age, CCI, and MMSE score, frail patients still showed evidence of reduced delta, theta, alpha, and beta power.
