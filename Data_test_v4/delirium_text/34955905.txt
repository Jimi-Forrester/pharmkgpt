34955905|t|A New Way Forward: How Brain SPECT Imaging Can Improve Outcomes and Transform Mental Health Care Into Brain Health Care.
34955905|a|In the past three decades, brain single-photon-emission-computed-tomography (SPECT) imaging has garnered a significant, evidence-based foundation for a wide array of indications relevant to the field of clinical psychiatry, including dementia, traumatic brain injuries, seizures, cerebrovascular disease, complex neuropsychiatric presentations, and treatment-resistant disorders. In clinical psychiatric practice, however, SPECT remains underutilized. Only a small percentage of psychiatric clinicians use brain imaging technology. In this article, the authors provide a rationale for shifting the paradigm to one that includes broader use of SPECT in the clinical psychiatric setting, primarily for patients with complex conditions. This paper will outline seven specific clinical applications. Adding neuroimaging tools like SPECT to day-to-day clinical practice can help move psychiatry forward by transforming mental health care, which can be stigmatizing and often shunned by the general public, to brain health care, which the authors argue will be more likely to be embraced by a larger group of people in need.
