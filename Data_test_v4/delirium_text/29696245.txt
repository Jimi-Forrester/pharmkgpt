29696245|t|Longitudinal Genotype-Phenotype Association Study via Temporal Structure Auto-Learning Predictive Model.
29696245|a|With rapid progress in high-throughput genotyping and neuroimaging, imaging genetics has gained significant attention in the research of complex brain disorders, such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD). The genotype-phenotype association study using imaging genetic data has the potential to reveal genetic basis and biological mechanism of brain structure and function. AD is a progressive neurodegenerative disease, thus, it is crucial to look into the relations between SNPs and longitudinal variations of neuroimaging phenotypes. Although some machine learning models were newly presented to capture the longitudinal patterns in genotype-phenotype association study, most of them required fixed longitudinal structures of prediction tasks and could not automatically learn the interrelations among longitudinal prediction tasks. To address this challenge, we proposed a novel temporal structure auto-learning model to automatically uncover longitudinal genotype-phenotype interrelations and utilized such interrelated structures to enhance phenotype prediction in the meantime. We conducted longitudinal phenotype prediction experiments on the ADNI cohort including 3,123 SNPs and 2 types of biomarkers, VBM and FreeSurfer. Empirical results demonstrated advantages of our proposed model over the counterparts. Moreover, available literature was identified for our top selected SNPs, which demonstrated the rationality of our prediction results.
