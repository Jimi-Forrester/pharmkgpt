33417840|t|Clinical Characteristics, Frailty, and Mortality of Residents With COVID-19 in Nursing Homes of a Region of Madrid.
33417840|a|OBJECTIVES: To describe the clinical characteristics, 30-day mortality, and associated factors of patients living in nursing homes (NH) with COVID-19, from March 20 to June 1, 2020. DESIGN: This is a retrospective study. A geriatric hospital-based team acted as a consultant and coordinated the care of older people living in NHs from the hospital. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 630 patients aged 70 and older with Coronavirus Disease 2019 COVID-19 living in 55 NHs. METHODS: A logistic regression was performed to analyze the factors associated with mortality. In addition, Kaplan-Meier curves were applied according to mortality and its associated factors using the log-rank Mantel-Cox test. RESULTS: The diagnosis of COVID-19 was mainly made by clinical compatibility (N = 430). Median age was 87 years, 64.6% were women and 45.9% were transferred to be cared for at the hospital. A total of 282 patients died (44.7%) within the 30 days of first attention by the team. A severe form of COVID-19 occurred in 473 patients, and the most frequent symptoms were dyspnea (n = 332) and altered level of consciousness (n = 301). According to multiple logistic regression, male sex (P = .019), the Clinical Frailty Score (CFS) >=6 (P = .004), dementia (P = .012), dyspnea (P < .001), and having a severe form of COVID-19 (P = .001), were associated with mortality, whereas age and care setting were not. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Mortality of the residents living in NHs with COVID-19 was almost 45%. The altered level of consciousness as an atypical presentation of COVID-19 should be considered in this population. A severe form of the disease, present in more than three-quarters of patients, was associated with mortality, apart from the male sex, CFS >=6, dementia, and dyspnea, whereas age and care setting were not. These findings may also help to recognize patients in which the Advance Care Planning process is especially urgent to assist in the decisions about their care.
