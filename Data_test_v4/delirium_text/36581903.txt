36581903|a|BACKGROUND: Clusterin is a multifunctional protein, which is associated with the pathogenesis and the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Compared with normal controls, inconsistent results have yielded in previous studies for concentration of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) clusterin in AD patients. We explored CSF clusterin levels in different pathological processes of AD. METHODS: Following the National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association (NIA-AA) criteria, we employed on the levels of CSF Abeta42(A), phosphorylated-Tau (T), and total-tau (N). Based on previously published cutoffs and the close correlation between CSF p-tau and t-tau, 276 participants from the publicly available ADNI database with CSF biomarkers were divided into four groups: A-(TN)- (normal Abeta42 and normal p-tau and t-tau; n = 50), A+(TN)- (abnormal Abeta42 and normal p-tau and t-tau; n = 39), A+(TN) + (abnormal Abeta42 and abnormal p-tau or t-tau; n = 147), A-(TN) + (normal Abeta42 and abnormal p-tau or t-tau; n = 40). To assess CSF clusterin levels in AD continuum, intergroup differences in four groups were compared. Pairwise comparisons were conducted as appropriate followed by Bonferroni post hoc analyses. To further study the relationships between CSF clusterin levels and AD core pathological biomarkers, we employed multiple linear regression method in subgroups. RESULTS: Compared with the A-(TN)- group, CSF clusterin levels were decreased in A+ (TN)- group (P = 0.002 after Bonferroni correction), but increased in the A+(TN) + group and the A-(TN) + group (both P <  0.001 after Bonferroni correction). Moreover, we found CSF clusterin levels are positively associated with CSF Abeta42 (beta = 0.040, P <  0. 001), CSF p-tau (beta = 0.325, P <  0.001) and CSF t-tau (beta = 0.346, P <  0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicated that there are differences levels of CSF clusterin in different stages of AD pathology. The CSF clusterin level decreased at the early stage are related to abnormal Abeta pathology; and the increased levels are associated with tau pathology and neurodegeneration.
