10716887|a|Diseases linked to defective mitochondrial function are characterized by morphologically abnormal, swollen mitochondria with distorted cristae. Several lines of evidence now suggest that sporadic forms of Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are linked to mitochondrial dysfunction arising from defects in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Human neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) cells that are deficient in mtDNA (Rho(0)) were repopulated with mitochondria from AD or PD patients or age-matched controls. These cytoplasmic hybrid (cybrid) cell lines differ only in the source of their mtDNA. Differences between cybrid cell lines therefore arise from differences in mtDNA and provide a model for the study of how impaired mitochondrial function alters the mitochondria themselves and how these changes adversely affect the neuronal cells they occupy. Cybrid cell mitochondria were labeled with the mitochondrial membrane potential-sensitive dye, JC-1. Analysis of these JC-1 labeled mitochondria by confocal microscopy revealed that mitochondrial membrane potential was significantly reduced in both PD and AD cybrid cells when compared with controls. Ultrastructural examination showed that control cybrid cells contained small, morphologically normal, round or oval mitochondria with a dark matrix and regular distribution of cristae. PD cybrid cells contained a significant and increased percentage of mitochondria that were enlarged or swollen and had a pale matrix with few remaining cristae (0.26-0.65 microm(2)). AD cybrid cells also contained a significantly increased percentage of enlarged or swollen mitochondria (0.25-5.0 microm(2)) that had a pale matrix and few remaining cristae. Other pathological features such as crystal-like intramitochondrial inclusions and cytoplasmic inclusion bodies were also found in PD and AD cybrids. These observations suggest that transfer of PD or AD mtDNA into Rho(0) cells was sufficient to produce pathological changes in mitochondrial ultrastructure that are similar to those seen in other mitochondrial disorders. These data were reported in abstract form (Trimmer et al., 1998, Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 24: 476).
