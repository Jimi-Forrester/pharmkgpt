35862456|t|Activity-dependent endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ uptake depends on Kv2.1-mediated endoplasmic reticulum/plasma membrane junctions to promote synaptic transmission.
35862456|a|The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) forms a continuous and dynamic network throughout a neuron, extending from dendrites to axon terminals, and axonal ER dysfunction is implicated in several neurological disorders. In addition, tight junctions between the ER and plasma membrane (PM) are formed by several molecules including Kv2 channels, but the cellular functions of many ER-PM junctions remain unknown. Recently, dynamic Ca2+ uptake into the ER during electrical activity was shown to play an essential role in synaptic transmission. Our experiments demonstrate that Kv2.1 channels are necessary for enabling ER Ca2+ uptake during electrical activity, as knockdown (KD) of Kv2.1 rendered both the somatic and axonal ER unable to accumulate Ca2+ during electrical stimulation. Moreover, our experiments demonstrate that the loss of Kv2.1 in the axon impairs synaptic vesicle fusion during stimulation via a mechanism unrelated to voltage. Thus, our data demonstrate that a nonconducting role of Kv2.1 exists through its binding to the ER protein VAMP-associated protein (VAP), which couples ER Ca2+ uptake with electrical activity. Our results further suggest that Kv2.1 has a critical function in neuronal cell biology for Ca2+ handling independent of voltage and reveals a critical pathway for maintaining ER lumen Ca2+ levels and efficient neurotransmitter release. Taken together, these findings reveal an essential nonclassical role for both Kv2.1 and the ER-PM junctions in synaptic transmission.
