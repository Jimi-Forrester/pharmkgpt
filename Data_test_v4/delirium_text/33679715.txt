33679715|t|Immune Deregulation in Sepsis and Septic Shock: Reversing Immune Paralysis by Targeting PD-1/PD-L1 Pathway.
33679715|a|Sepsis remains a major problem for human health worldwide, thereby manifesting high rates of morbidity and mortality. Sepsis, once understood as a monophasic sustained hyperinflammation, is currently recognized as a dysregulated host response to infection, with both hyperinflammation and immunoparalysis occurring simultaneously from the earliest stages of sepsis, involving multiple organ dysfunctions. Despite the recent progress in the understanding of the pathophysiology underlying sepsis, no specific treatment to restore immune dysregulation in sepsis has been validated in clinical trials. In recent years, treatment for immune checkpoints such as the programmed cell death protein 1/programmed death ligand (PD-1/PD-L) pathway in tumor-infiltrating T-lymphocytes has been successful in the field of cancer immune therapy. As immune-paralysis in sepsis involves exhausted T-lymphocytes, future clinical applications of checkpoint inhibitors for sepsis are expected. In addition, the functions of PD-1/PD-L on innate lymphoid cells and the role of exosomal forms of PD-L1 warrant further research. Looking back on the history of repeatedly failed clinical trials of immune modulatory therapies for sepsis, sepsis must be recognized as a difficult disease entity for performing clinical trials. A major obstacle that could prevent effective clinical trials of drug candidates is the disease complexity and heterogeneities; clinically diagnosed sepsis could contain multiple sepsis subgroups that suffer different levels of hyper-inflammation and immune-suppression in distinct organs. Thus, the selection of appropriate more homogenous sepsis subgroup is the key for testing the clinical efficacy of experimental therapies targeting specific pathways in either hyperinflammation and/or immunoparalysis. An emerging technology such as artificial intelligence (AI) may help to identify an immune paralysis subgroup who would best be treated by PD-1/PD-L1 pathway inhibitors.
