36769363|t|Effects of Positive Fighting Experience and Its Subsequent Deprivation on the Expression Profile of Mouse Hippocampal Genes Associated with Neurogenesis.
36769363|a|The hippocampus is known as the brain region implicated in visuospatial processes and processes associated with learning and short- and long-term memory. An important functional characteristic of the hippocampus is lifelong neurogenesis. A decrease or increase in adult hippocampal neurogenesis is associated with a wide range of neurological diseases. We have previously shown that in adult male mice with a chronic positive fighting experience in daily agonistic interactions, there is an increase in the proliferation of progenitor neurons and the production of young neurons in the dentate gyrus (in hippocampus), and these neurogenesis parameters remain modified during 2 weeks of deprivation of further fights. The aim of the present work was to identify hippocampal genes associated with neurogenesis and involved in the formation of behavioral features in mice with the chronic experience of wins in aggressive confrontations, as well as during the subsequent 2-week deprivation of agonistic interactions. Hippocampal gene expression profiles were compared among three groups of adult male mice: chronically winning for 20 days in the agonistic interactions, chronically victorious for 20 days followed by the 2-week deprivation of fights, and intact (control) mice. Neurogenesis-associated genes were identified whose transcription levels changed during the social confrontations and in the subsequent period of deprivation of fights. In the experimental males, some of these genes are associated with behavioral traits, including abnormal aggression-related behavior, an abnormal anxiety-related response, and others. Two genes encoding transcription factors (Nr1d1 and Fmr1) were likely to contribute the most to the between-group differences. It can be concluded that the chronic experience of wins in agonistic interactions alters hippocampal levels of transcription of multiple genes in adult male mice. The transcriptome changes get reversed only partially after the 2-week period of deprivation of fights. The identified differentially expressed genes associated with neurogenesis and involved in the control of a behavior/neurological phenotype can be used in further studies to identify targets for therapeutic correction of the neurological disturbances that develop in winners under the conditions of chronic social confrontations.
