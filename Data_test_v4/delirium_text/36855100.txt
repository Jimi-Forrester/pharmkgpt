36855100|a|BACKGROUND: Frailty has been considered to be associated with major mortality and increased length of stay after cardiac surgery. This study aimed to explore the predictive potential of frailty assessment in the prognosis of elderly patients undergoing bypass surgery. METHODS: This study assessed the preoperative frailty according to the Fried's frailty phenotype, and included 150 frail and 150 non-frail elderly patients (>= 65 y) who underwent bypass surgery. The present study evaluated the prognosis of elderly patients based on sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, and collected clinical indicators to construct logistic regression models with the prognosis as the dependent variable, to explore the potential predictive ability of preoperative frailty. Moreover, this study focused on the complications and analyzed the relationship between preoperative frailty and postoperative complications. RESULTS: In the present study, 244 patients were divided into the favorable prognosis group and 56 patients were divided into the unfavorable prognosis group. Logistic regression analysis showed that increased myoglobin and high cardiac function classification were independent risk factors for unfavorable prognosis in elderly patients undergoing bypass surgery. The discrimination of the clinical prediction model was determined by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and the area under curve (AUC) was 0.928. After adding preoperative frailty assessment, the AUC was improved to 0.939. This study found a significant correlation between preoperative frailty and postoperative complications, mainly in the circulatory system. CONCLUSION: Preoperative frailty assessment could be a predictive factor for the prognosis of elderly patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. According to our study, frailty assessment and appropriate intervention before bypass surgery may be beneficial to the enhanced recovery after cardiac surgery. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The clinical study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University (2021-SR-393). All patients signed an informed consent form.
