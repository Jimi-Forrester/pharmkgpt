22366771|a|In France, one of the aims of the current national Alzheimer's disease plan is to collect data from all memory centers (memory units, memory resource and research centers, independent neurologists) throughout the country. Here we describe the French Alzheimer Information System and present a 'snapshot' of the data collected throughout the country during the first year of operation. We analyzed all data transmitted by memory centers between January 2010 and December 2010. Each participating center is required to transmit information on patients to the French National Alzheimer dataBank (BNA). This involves completing a computer file containing 31 variables corresponding to a limited data set on AD (CIMA: Corpus minimum d'information Alzheimer). In 2010, the BNA received data from 320 memory centers relating to 199,113 consultations involving 118,776 patients. An analysis of the data shows that the initial MMSE (Mini Mental State Examination) mean score for patients in France was 16.8 points for Alzheimer's disease, 25.7 points for mild cognitive impairment, and 18.8 points for 'related disorders related disorders. The BNA will provide longitudinal data that can be used to assess the needs of individual local health areas and size specialized care provision in each regional health scheme. By contributing to the BNA, the memory centers enhance their clinical activity and help to advance knowledge in epidemiology and medical research in the important field of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias.
