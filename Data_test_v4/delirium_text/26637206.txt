26637206|t|Mycetismus: a review.
26637206|a|Although rare, death from amanitin exposure poses a significant health risk and a diagnostic challenge to the clinician due to its rarity. This is one of the few conditions to be voluntarily reported by healthcare professionals. No antidote exists for this poisoning and, perhaps due to its rarity or lack of attention, the United States has lagged behind Europe for almost three decades in treatment, diagnostics and experimentation. This regrettable fact warrants the formation of a centralized agency for education, the advancement of research and the collection of data, to provide better treatment for the population.
