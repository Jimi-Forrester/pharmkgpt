2675888|a|Physostigmine is widely used for treatment of the central anticholinergic syndrome during recovery from anaesthesia. The drug is also very useful in treatment of intoxicated patients, in differential-diagnostic procedures of coma of unknown origin, and in restoration of vigilance after prolonged sedation for mechanical ventilation. Besides the specific central cholinergic action of physostigmine, several new pharmacological actions have now been established. Analgesic action is dependent on the interaction with the 5-HT (serotoninergic) system and is independent of narcotic or cholinergic agonists. The antianalgetic stress hormone, ACTH, also does not interfere with this action. Physostigmine does not interfere with the anaesthetic state when given during general anaesthesia. It attenuates several withdrawal states, especially alcohol delirium, opiate and nitrous oxide withdrawal syndromes. The drug may offer a protective mechanism against hypoxic damage of the brain and may also be beneficial in amnestic syndromes and sleep disorders. Physostigmine produces central and peripheral cardiovascular stimulation. It has been shown that physostigmine can be useful in prevention and treatment of postanaesthetic behavioural disturbances following anaesthesia with propofol. Number of indications for use of physostigmine has increased considerably.
