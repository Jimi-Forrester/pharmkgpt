32308720|a|The promotion of neurogenesis can be a promising strategy to improve and restore neuronal function in neurodegenerative diseases. Nerve growth factor (NGF) plays a key role in neurite outgrowth and synaptic formation during brain repair stage. Nowadays, there are several studies on the developing methods to enhance the endogenous NGF activity for treatment and restore the neuronal function. In this study, the potentiating effect of sesamin, a major lignan in sesame seeds (Sesamum indicum) and oil, on NGF-induced neurogenesis and its involved mechanisms were firstly reported. Sesamin effectively enhanced the PC12 neuron-like cell differentiation and neurite length under insufficient conditions of NGF. The neuronal markers including synaptophysin and growth-associated protein-43 along with the synaptic connections were significantly increased in combination treatment between sesamin and NGF. Moreover, sesamin also increased the level of phospho-ERK1/2 and SIRT1 protein, an important regulatory protein of the neurogenesis process. The neurogenesis was blocked by the specific SIRT1 inhibitor, JGB1741, suggesting that the neuritogenic effect of sesamin was associated with SIRT1 protein modulation. Taken together, the potentiating effect of sesamin on NGF-induced neurogenesis in this finding could be used for alternative treatment in neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease.
