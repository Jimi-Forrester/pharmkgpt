20933414|t|Design, synthesis, and structure-activity relationship studies of N-arylsulfonyl morpholines as gamma-secretase inhibitors.
20933414|a|Design and synthesis of cis-2,6-disubstituted N-arylsulfonyl morpholines as novel gamma-secretase inhibitors for the potential treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is reported. Several different small alkyl groups are installed on the left-hand side to lower the CYP3A4 liability while maintaining excellent in vitro potency.
