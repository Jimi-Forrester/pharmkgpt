37986935|t|Neuronal Glycogen Breakdown Mitigates Tauopathy via Pentose Phosphate Pathway-Mediated Oxidative Stress Reduction.
37986935|a|Tauopathies encompass a range of neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Unfortunately, current treatment approaches for tauopathies have yielded limited success, underscoring the pressing need for novel therapeutic strategies. We observed distinct signatures of impaired glycogen metabolism in the Drosophila brain of the tauopathy model and the brain of AD patients, indicating a link between tauopathies and glycogen metabolism. We demonstrate that the breakdown of neuronal glycogen by activating glycogen phosphorylase (GlyP) ameliorates the tauopathy phenotypes in flies and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derived neurons from FTD patients. We observed that glycogen breakdown redirects the glucose flux to the pentose phosphate pathway to alleviate oxidative stress. Our findings uncover a critical role for increased GlyP activity in mediating the neuroprotection benefit of dietary restriction (DR) through the cAMP-mediated protein kinase A (PKA) activation. Our studies identify impaired glycogen metabolism as a key hallmark for tauopathies and offer a promising therapeutic target in tauopathy treatment.
