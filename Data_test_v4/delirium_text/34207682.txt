34207682|t|The Combination of Liposomes and Metallic Nanoparticles as Multifunctional Nanostructures in the Therapy and Medical Imaging-A Review.
34207682|a|Nanotechnology has introduced a new quality and has definitely developed the possibilities of treating and diagnosing various diseases. One of the scientists' interests is liposomes and metallic nanoparticles (LipoMNPs)-the combination of which has introduced new properties and applications. However, the field of creating hybrid nanostructures consisting of liposomes and metallic nanoparticles is relatively little understood. The purpose of this review was to compile the latest reports in the field of treatment and medical imaging using of LipoMNPs. The authors focused on presenting this issue in the direction of improving the used conventional treatment and imaging methods. Most of all, the nature of bio-interactions between nanostructures and cells is not sufficiently taken into account. As a result, overcoming the existing limitations in the implementation of such solutions in the clinic is difficult. We concluded that hybrid nanostructures are used in a very wide range, especially in the treatment of cancer and magnetic resonance imaging. There were also solutions that combine treatments with simultaneous imaging, creating a theragnostic approach. In the future, researchers should focus on the description of the biological interactions and the long-term effects of the nanostructures to use LipoMNPs in the treatment of patients.
