38049600|a|Four structured acylglycerols with stigmasterol bonded by a succinyl linker were investigated and their stability were analyzed. Samples were heated to 60  C and kept at that temperature to simulate storage, and to 180  C to simulate frying conditions. The degradation of the synthesized compounds and formed derivatives was determined, and their cytotoxicity and genotoxicity on normal human cells from the digestive system was determined. Holding at 180  C resulted in greater degradation of the compounds than holding at 60  C. The most stable compound in each sample proved to be one with oleic acid in its structure-1,3-dioleoyl-2-stigmasterylsuccinoyl-sn-glycerol (DO2SSt) at 60  C and 1,2-dioleoyl-3-stigmasterylsuccinoyl-sn-glycerol (DO3SSt) at 180  C. These results indicate that the type of fatty acid in the molecule is more important than its position in the glycerol structure. None of the diacylmonostigmasterylsuccinoyl-sn-glycerols (DASStGs) before or after heating exhibited cytotoxic or genotoxic potential to small intestine and colon mucosa cells.
