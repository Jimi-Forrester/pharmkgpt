19285732|a|Participants in studies of psychometric risk for schizophrenia are rarely informed of their risk status. Nondisclosure may be justifiable if the harmful effects of disclosure outweigh its benefits. We examined whether disclosure may adversely affect well-being and, if so, factors that predict the degree of adverse effect. Undergraduates (n=114) rated the anticipated impact--on felt distress, coping, optimism, helplessness, future lifestyle choices, and survival--of discovering they were at risk for schizophrenia and six other diseases. They also completed measures of potential predictors of this impact, including knowledge about schizophrenia, vicarious experience of schizophrenia, their potential to suffer stigmatization because of schizophrenia, and schizotypy. Participants judged schizophrenia risk more negatively than risk for heart disease, arthritis, depression, and diabetes, and less negatively than risk for cancer and Alzheimer's disease. Higher disorder-nonspecific impact, greater stigma, and lower psychometric risk for schizophrenia together provided the best linear prediction of schizophrenia-specific impact. Awareness of schizophrenia risk creates a significant adverse impact, the level of which may be greatest among those with lowest risk.
