30078855|t|Efficacy of dexmedetomidine for prevention of emergence agitation in patients posted for nasal surgery under desflurane anaesthesia: A prospective double-blinded randomised controlled trial.
30078855|a|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Nasal surgery under desflurane anaesthesia is more prone to develop emergence agitation (EA). The present study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of dexmedetomidine for prevention of EA. METHODS: A total of 72 patients were randomised to group C and group D. Group C patients received placebo while group D patients received dexmedetomidine 1.0 mug/kg bolus followed by 0.4 mug/kg/h after induction of anesthesia. End tidal desflurane was adjusted to keep the bispectral index (BIS) 45-55. Study drug was stopped at extubation. EA was evaluated from extubation till the patient was shifted to postanaesthesia care unit (PACU). Primary outcome was incidence of EA. Secondary outcome measures were requirement of desflurane, haemodynamic stability, and recovery after anaesthesia. The results were analyzed using SPSS version 21. RESULTS: Infusion of dexmedetomidine significantly reduced the incidence of EA (Group C 52.8%; Group D 5.6%) by 89.5% (P = 0.00001). The endtidal desflurane concentration was significantly lower and there was an average 28.87% reduction in requirement of desflurane in group D compared to group C (P < 0.001). The mean heart rate was significantly higher in Group C (P < 0.001). In group C time to extubation, time to achieve BIS 90 and time to response on verbal command was significantly lesser compared to group D (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Dexmedetomidine significantly reduced the incidence of EA and requirement of desflurane in patients undergoing nasal surgery. However, it was associated with delayed extubation, residual sedation, and prolonged PACU stay.
