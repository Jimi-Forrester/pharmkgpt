21148344|a|Alzheimer's disease is hypothesized to be caused by an imbalance between beta-amyloid (Abeta) production and clearance that leads to Abeta accumulation in the central nervous system (CNS). Abeta production and clearance are key targets in the development of disease-modifying therapeutic agents for Alzheimer's disease. However, there has not been direct evidence of altered Abeta production or clearance in Alzheimer's disease. By using metabolic labeling, we measured Abeta42 and Abeta40 production and clearance rates in the CNS of participants with Alzheimer's disease and cognitively normal controls. Clearance rates for both Abeta42 and Abeta40 were impaired in Alzheimer's disease compared with controls. On average, there were no differences in Abeta40 or Abeta42 production rates. Thus, the common late-onset form of Alzheimer's disease is characterized by an overall impairment in Abeta clearance.
