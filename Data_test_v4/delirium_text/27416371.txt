27416371|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of progressive intellectual failure and memory impairment among the elderly, affecting over 4 million Americans. A hallmark of the disease is the accumulation of beta-amyloid, whose neurotoxicity has been well documented. A therapeutic approach may be to ameliorate this toxicity. Garlic has antioxidant, anti-aging and anti-ischemic properties. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether aged garlic extract attenuates the effect of neurotoxin, beta-amyloid 25-35 (Abeta) in neuronal PC12 cells. Proliferating (non-neuronal) PC12 cells were treated with the nerve growth factor for at least 4 days before experiments were initiated. This treatment differentiates PC12 cells to a neuronal cell line. Cell viability was determined using the MTS-based assay (Promega). Wakunaga of America (Mission Viejo, CA) kindly donated aged garlic extract(TM) (AGE(TM)) as Kyolic(R) liquid. AGE(TM) was sterilized by filtration and diluted in cell growth medium. Our results show that AGE  protects neuronal PC12 cells against Abeta (95nM) toxicity in a dose dependent manner. AGE(TM) may be effective in ameliorating Abeta -neurotoxicity.
