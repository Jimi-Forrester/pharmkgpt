28969005|a|Exosomes play important roles in cell-cell communication, and are likely mediators of the metastatic cascade in cancer. This study examined the role of exosomes in pancreatic cancer cell adhesion, migration, and invasion. We isolated and purified exosomes from two isogenic pancreatic cancer cell lines with different metastatic potentials. Uptake of exosomes from highly metastatic Panc02-H7 cells decreased adhesion and increased migration and invasion capacity in weakly metastatic Panc02 cells in vitro. Exosomes from highly metastatic pancreatic cancer cells induced liver pre-metastatic niche formation in naive mice and promoted primary tumor growth and liver metastasis in vivo. We identified 4,517 proteins in exosomes from Panc02 and Panc02-H7 cells via iTRAQ quantitative proteomic analyses, 79 of which were differentially expressed between the two cell lines. Bioinformatics analyses showed that most of the differentially expressed proteins were involved in pancreatic cancer growth, invasion, and metastasis, and that metabolism-related signaling pathways were involved in exosome-mediated intracellular communication. Further studies will be needed to determine whether these proteins are potential pancreatic cancer diagnostic/prognostic markers or novel therapeutic targets.
