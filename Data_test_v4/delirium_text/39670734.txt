39670734|a|The Learning and Associative Memory (LAM) test is a face-name associative memory test created to detect early Alzheimer's disease (AD). In a recent study, it was administered to cognitively healthy individuals with different levels of amyloid-beta (Abeta) and tau burden. The key findings for LAM were: 1) selective correlations with Abeta levels, 2) unique discriminatory power between A + and A- individuals, 3) significantly higher areas under the curve in receiver operating curve analysis. Future research should focus on comparing performance on the LAM and face-name associative memory tests to determine the most effective method for detecting early signs of AD.
