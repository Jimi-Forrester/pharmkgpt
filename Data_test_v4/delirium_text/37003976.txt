37003976|a|BACKGROUND: Seeking positive and comprehensive rehabilitation methods after stroke is an urgent problem to be solved, which is very important to improve the dysfunction of stroke. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of motor imagery-based brain-computer interface training (MI-BCI) on upper limb function and attention in stroke patients with hemiplegia. METHODS: Sixty stroke patients with impairment of upper extremity function and decreased attention were randomly assigned to the control group (CR group) or the experimental group (BCI group) in a 1:1 ratio. Patients in the CR group received conventional rehabilitation. Patients in the BCI group received 20 min of MI-BCI training five times a week for 3 weeks (15 sessions) in addition to conventional rehabilitation. The primary outcome measures were the changes in Fugl-Meyer Motor Function Assessment of Upper Extremities (FMA-UE) and Attention Network Test (ANT) from baseline to 3 weeks. RESULTS: About 93% of the patients completed the allocated training. Compared with the CR group, among those in the BCI group, FMA-UE was increased by 8.0 points (95%CI, 5.0 to 10.0; P < 0.001). Alert network response time (32.4ms; 95%CI, 58.4 to 85.6; P < 0.001), orienting network response (5.6ms; 95%CI, 29.8 to 55.8; P = 0.010), and corrects number (8.0; 95%CI, 17.0 to 28.0; P < 0.001) also increased in the BCI group compared with the CR group. Additionally, the executive control network response time (- 105.9ms; 95%CI, - 68.3 to - 23.6; P = 0.002), the total average response time (- 244.8ms; 95%CI, - 155.8 to - 66.2; P = 0.002), and total time (- 122.0ms; 95%CI, - 80.0 to - 35.0; P = 0.001) were reduced in the BCI group compared with the CR group. CONCLUSION: MI-BCI combined with conventional rehabilitation training could better enhance upper limb motor function and attention in stroke patients. This training method may be feasible and suitable for individuals with stroke. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study was registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry with Portal Number ChiCTR2100050430(27/08/2021).
