34395428|t|Hypothesis and Theory: Characterizing Abnormalities of Energy Metabolism Using a Cellular Platform as a Personalized Medicine Approach for Alzheimer's Disease.
34395428|a|Sporadic or late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) is characterized by slowly progressive deterioration and death of CNS neurons. There are currently no substantially disease-modifying therapies. LOAD pathology is closely related to changes with age and include, among others, accumulation of toxic molecules and altered metabolic, microvascular, biochemical and inflammatory processes. In addition, there is growing evidence that cellular energy deficits play a critical role in aging and LOAD pathophysiology. However, the exact mechanisms and causal relationships are largely unknown. In our studies we tested the hypothesis that altered bioenergetic and metabolic cell functions are key elements in LOAD, using a cellular platform consisting of skin fibroblasts derived from LOAD patients and AD-unaffected control individuals and therefrom generated induced pluripotent stem cells that are differentiated to brain-like cells to study LOAD pathogenic processes in context of age, disease, genetic background, cell development, and cell type. This model has revealed that LOAD cells exhibit a multitude of bioenergetic and metabolic alterations, providing evidence for an innate inefficient cellular energy management in LOAD as a prerequisite for the development of neurodegenerative disease with age. We propose that this cellular platform could ultimately be used as a conceptual basis for a personalized medicine tool to predict altered aging and risk for development of dementia, and to test or implement customized therapeutic or disease-preventive intervention strategies.
