33210839|a|Demyelination occurs in response to brain injury and is observed in many neurodegenerative diseases. Myelin is synthesized from oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system, and oligodendrocyte death-induced demyelination is one of the mechanisms involved in white matter damage after stroke and neurodegeneration. Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) exist in the brain of normal adults, and their differentiation into mature oligodendrocytes play a central role in remyelination. Although the differentiation and maturity of OPCs drive endogenous efforts for remyelination, the failure of axons to remyelinate is still the biggest obstacle to brain repair after injury or diseases. In recent years, studies have made attempts to promote remyelination after brain injury and disease, but its cellular or molecular mechanism is not yet fully understood. In this review, we discuss recent studies examining the demyelination process and potential therapeutic strategies for remyelination in aging and stroke. Based on our current understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying remyelination, we hypothesize that myelin and oligodendrocytes are viable therapeutic targets to mitigate brain injury and to treat demyelinating-related neurodegeneration diseases.
