38931442|t|Polyphenols: Natural Food-Grade Biomolecules for the Treatment of Nervous System Diseases from a Multi-Target Perspective.
38931442|a|Polyphenols are the most prevalent naturally occurring phytochemicals in the human diet and range in complexity from simple molecules to high-molecular-weight polymers. They have a broad range of chemical structures and are generally categorized as "neuroprotective", "anti-inflammatory", and "antioxidant" given their main function of halting disease onset and promoting health. Research has shown that some polyphenols and their metabolites can penetrate the blood-brain barrier and hence increase neuroprotective signaling and neurohormonal effects to provide anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. Therefore, multi-targeted modulation of polyphenols may prevent the progression of neuropsychiatric disorders and provide a new practical therapeutic strategy for difficult-to-treat neuropsychiatric disorders. Therefore, multi-target modulation of polyphenols has the potential to prevent the progression of neuropsychiatric disorders and provide a new practical therapeutic strategy for such nervous system diseases. Herein, we review the therapeutic benefits of polyphenols on autism-spectrum disorders, anxiety disorders, depression, and sleep disorders, along with in vitro and ex vivo experimental and clinical trials. Although their methods of action are still under investigation, polyphenols are still seldom employed directly as therapeutic agents for nervous system disorders. Comprehensive mechanistic investigations and large-scale multicenter randomized controlled trials are required to properly evaluate the safety, effectiveness, and side effects of polyphenols.
