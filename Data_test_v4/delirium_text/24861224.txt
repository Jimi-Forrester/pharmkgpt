24861224|a|INTRODUCTION AND AIM: The quantitative and qualitative analysis of the semantic verbal fluency task has revealed that people with dementia produced fewer words and smaller semantic clustering than people without dementia. However, in people with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), research has shown conflicting results regarding the amount and number of semantic clusters that are made. The aim of this study was to provide new data to this controversial issue. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Twenty-two older adults diagnosed with aMCI (8 men and 14 women) and 43 older adults (7 men and 36 women) with normal cognitive functioning that served as control group, participated in this study. All patients were evaluated at the Center for Prevention of Cognitive Decline of Madrid (Spain), completing the verbal fluency test (animals) besides other neuropsychological tests. RESULTS: As expected, animal production was lower in the aMCI group than in the control group, but no differences were observed either in the average size of the semantic clusters or the number of switches between them. CONCLUSIONS: The results are consistent with previous research suggesting aMCI is not only characterized by episodic memory and working memory deficits. Semantic memory decline is also present. However, the data do not clarify how strategic executive processes are involved, as seems to be in Alzheimer's disease.
