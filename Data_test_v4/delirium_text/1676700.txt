1676700|t|Exclusion of linkage to the pericentromeric region of chromosome 21 in the Canadian pedigree with familial Alzheimer disease.
1676700|a|Alzheimer disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease leading to global dementia. The familial form (FAD) has been linked to markers on chromosome 21 in some families, most tightly to the loci D21S16 and D21S13 located close to the centromere of the long arm. In other families the FAD mutation has been excluded from the more telomeric D21S1/S11 region, but not from the centromeric region of chromosome 21. We identified two new restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) for the locus D21S13 and have used these RFLPs for the analysis of one of the largest known early-onset FAD pedigrees. We calculated pairwise and multipoint lod scores for the loci D21S13, D21S110, and D21S11. Linkage to this region of chromosome 21 was excluded with maximum negative lod scores of -6.4 at D21S13 and D21S110. Thus, it is unlikely that the FAD mutation in this family is located in the region that has shown linkage in other FAD pedigrees. This result provides evidence for genetic heterogeneity of early-onset FAD or a location of FAD centromeric to D21S13.
