25408213|a|The accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide is one of the major neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We have analyzed whether the progression of amyloidosis differentially affects males and females along aging in AbetaPP/PS1 transgenic mice. The levels of peripheral amyloid, Abeta40 and Abeta42, are not modified in either sex until 9 months of age. After that, however, there is an increase in amyloid levels in plasma among females and a decrease among males. These findings could be essential to design gender-specific strategies in other in vivo experiments or even in AD treatments.
