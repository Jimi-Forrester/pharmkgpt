35973552|a|BACKGROUND: The investigation of lncRNAs has provided a novel perspective for elucidating mechanisms underlying diverse physiological and pathological processes. Compelling evidence has revealed an intrinsic link between lncRNAs and lipid metabolism, demonstrating that lncRNAs-induced disruption of lipid metabolism and signaling contribute to the development of multiple cancers and some other diseases, including obesity, fatty liver disease, and cardiovascular disease. AIMOF REVIEW: The current review summarizes the recent advances in basic research about lipid metabolism and lipid signaling-related lncRNAs. Meanwhile, the potential and challenges of targeting lncRNA for the therapy of cancers and other lipid metabolism-related diseases are also discussed. KEY SCIENTIFIC CONCEPT OF REVIEW: Compared with the substantial number of lncRNA loci, we still know little about the role of lncRNAs in metabolism. A more comprehensive understanding of the function and mechanism of lncRNAs may provide a new standpoint for the study of lipid metabolism and signaling. Developing lncRNA-based therapeutic approaches is an effective strategy for lipid metabolism-related diseases.
