17055268|t|2,6-Disubstituted N-arylsulfonyl piperidines as gamma-secretase inhibitors.
17055268|a|A novel piperidine series of gamma-secretase inhibitors, potentially useful for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, is disclosed. SAR investigation revealed the requirement for cis-stereochemistry of the substituents attached to the core, which resulted in the chair-like diaxial conformation of the piperidine ring. The series was optimized to provide inhibitors with IC(50)'s in the single-digit nanomolar range. Absolute stereochemistry of the active enantiomer was assigned.
