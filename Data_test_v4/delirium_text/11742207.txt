11742207|t|Cholinergic deficits in the brains of patients with parkinsonism-dementia complex of Guam.
11742207|a|Patients with parkinsonism-dementia complex (PDC) of Guam showed moderate loss of choline acetyl transferase activity in the midfrontal and inferior parietal cortex, and severe loss in the superior temporal cortex. This deficit was similar to that seen in Alzheimer's disease and less severe than Lewy body disease. Thus, cholinergic deficits in the neocortex might contribute to some of the cognitive alterations in PDC of Guam.
