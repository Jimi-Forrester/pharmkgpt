38469759|a|BACKGROUND: The aim is to compare the plasma levels of hyaluronic acid (HA) which is closely related to inflam-mation and vascular changes and arterial stiffness (AS) related values in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), amnestic type mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), and normal cognitive functions (NCF). METHODS: Ninety participants were categorized into three groups, patients with AD, MCI, and NCF. Arterial stiffness measurement in the nephrology outpatient clinic, and storage and analysis of plasma samples in the biochemistry laboratory. RESULTS: Of the 90 patients, 32 had NCF, 32 had aMCI, and 26 had AD. Between groups, there was no difference in HA, pulse wave velocity, and augmentation index. The HA level had no statistically significant correlation with any of the other variables. CONCLUSIONS: Plasma HA levels will not be useful in the diagnosis of AD. More comprehensive studies with larger number of patients are needed.
