7985141|t|[Protracted hypochondriacal reactions (based on the type of hypochondriacal development) in myocardial infarct patients].
7985141|a|Clinical follow-up, MPT, clinical and instrumental cardiological evidence is available for 30 postmyocardial infarction patients. They exhibited hypochondriac reactions which persisted for more than 6 months. Three types of such reactions were recognized: somatization (I), cenesthetic (II), overvalued (III). I reactions were associated with homonomous body sensations, anxious and conversion disorders, avoidance behavior. II reactions cover heteronomous sensations with attendant autoaggressive behavior. Patients with reactions III had dominant ideas of complete health recovery, delirium-like fantasies. It is established that I reactions arise in personalities with neurotism radical, reactions II in those with rigidity and eccentric behavior, reactions III in patients with rigidity and conformity.
