34066494|t|Mango (Mangifera indica L.) Polyphenols: Anti-Inflammatory Intestinal Microbial Health Benefits, and Associated Mechanisms of Actions.
34066494|a|Mango is rich in polyphenols including gallotannins and gallic acid, among others. The bioavailability of mango polyphenols, especially polymeric gallotannins, is largely dependent on the intestinal microbiota, where the generation of absorbable metabolites depends on microbial enzymes. Mango polyphenols can favorably modulate bacteria associated with the production of bioactive gallotannin metabolites including Lactobacillus plantarum, resulting in intestinal health benefits. In several studies, the prebiotic effects of mango polyphenols and dietary fiber, their potential contribution to lower intestinal inflammation and promotion of intestinal integrity have been demonstrated. Additionally, polyphenols occurring in mango have some potential to interact with intestinal and less likely with hepatic enzymes or transporter systems. This review provides an overview of interactions of mango polyphenols with the intestinal microbiome, associated health benefits and underlying mechanisms.
