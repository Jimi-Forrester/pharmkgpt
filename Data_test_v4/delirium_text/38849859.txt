These complications can significantly affect recovery and increase healthcare costs. This study investigates the effects of low-dose S-ketamine on reducing POD and POCD in this patient demographic. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, medical records of patients aged >= 65 years who underwent elective thoracic surgery from January 2019 to August 2023 were reviewed. Patients were categorized into S-ketamine and Control groups based on intraoperative S-ketamine exposure. POD was assessed using the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM), while cognitive function was evaluated using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) at baseline, 1 week, 1 month, and 6 months post-surgery. Intraoperative and postoperative parameters, including hemodynamic stability, blood loss, pain scores, and ICU stay length, were also recorded. RESULTS: The study comprised 140 participants, with 70 in each group. The S-ketamine group demonstrated a significantly lower incidence of POD at 7 days post-surgery (12.0% vs. 26.7%, P < 0.001), and reduced POCD at 1 month (18.7% vs. 36.0%, P < 0.05) and 6 months (10.7% vs. 21.3%, P < 0.05). The Ketamine group had a significantly higher median MoCA score compared to the Control group both at 1 month (P = 0.021) and 6 months (P = 0.007). Adverse events, such as infection, bleeding, and respiratory failure, showed no significant differences between the groups, suggesting a safe profile for S-ketamine. CONCLUSION: Administering low-dose S-ketamine during thoracic surgery in patients aged 65 years and above significantly reduces the incidence of POD and POCD, highlighting its neuroprotective potential. These findings advocate for the inclusion of S-ketamine in anesthetic protocols to improve postoperative outcomes and reduce healthcare costs in this patient population.
