28695802|t|Effect of Ganoderma Lucidum Preparation on the Behavior,Biochemistry,and Autoimmune Parameters of Mouse Models of APP/PS1 Double Transgenic Alzheimer's Disease.
28695802|a|Objective To evaluate the efficacy of Ganoderma lucidum preparation on the behaviors,biochemistry,and autoimmunity parameters of mouse models of APP/PS-1 double transgenic Alzheimer's disease(AD).Methods A total of 44 4-month-old APP/PS-1 double transgenic AD mice were randomly divided into AD model group,Aricept group,Ganoderma lucidum middle-dose(LZ-M)group,and Ganoderma lucidum high-dose(LZ-H)group,with 11 mice in each group.In addition,10 4-month-old C57BL/6 mice were used as the control group.Water maze test was conducted to observe the behavior changes,and the protein expressions in brain tissues were detected by Western blot analysis.The autoimmune indicators were detected by indirect immunofluorescence method.Results In the navigation experiment,the time of finding the platform was gradually shortened since the 2nd day in the control,LZ-H,and LZ-M groups,and the time of searching the platform in the AD model group gradually increased.On the 5th day,the time of finding platform was significantly shorter in control group (t=5.607,P=0.000) and LZ-H group(t=2.750,P=0.010)than AD model group.In the space exploration experiment,the number of crossing the target platform(t=2.452,P=0.025)and the residence time in the target quadrant(t=2.530,P=0.020)in AD model group mice was significantly smaller/shorter than those in control group;in addition,the number of crossing the target platform in the AD model group was significantly smaller than that in LZ-H group(t=2.317,P=0.030)and LZ-M group(t=2.443,P=0.030),while the residence time in target quadrant decreased significantly(t=2.770,P=0.020)compared with LZ-H group;the number of crossing through the target platform quadrant(t=2.493,P=0.022)and residence time in the target quadrant(t=2.683,P=0.015)in LZ-H group were significantly higher than in Aricept group.Western blot analysis showed that the expression of ApoA1 in the brain tissues of mice in LZ-H and LZ-M groups were significantly higher than those in AD model group(P<0.01,P<0.05);Abeta-40 expression in LZ-H group was significantly lower than that in AD model group(P<0.05);the expressions of Syt1,ApoE,and ABCA1 in brain tissues of mice in LZ-H group were significantly higher than those in model group(P<0.01,P<0.05).The plasma IgG level in Aricept group(t=30.945,P=0.000),LZ-M group(t=25.639,P=0.000)and LZ-H group(t=4.689,P=0.001)were significantly higher than that in the control group.Conclusion Ganoderma lucidum preparation can improve behavior disorders of AD model mice,promote the expressions of ApoA1,ApoE and Syt1,inhibit the expression of Abeta-40 protein,and improve the autoimmune function.
