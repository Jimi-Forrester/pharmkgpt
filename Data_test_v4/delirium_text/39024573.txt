39024573|t|Cellular Mechanisms of Cognitive Enhancement: The In Vivo Modulation of the Firing Activity and the Responsiveness of Rat Hippocampal Neurons by Memantine and Alpha7 Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor Ligands.
39024573|a|Promising new pharmacological strategies for the enhancement of cognition target either nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) or N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDAR). There is also an increasing interest in low-dose combination therapies co-targeting the above neurotransmitter systems to reach greater efficacy over the monotreatments and to reduce possible side effects of high-dose monotreatments. In the present study, we assessed modulatory effects of the alpha7 nAChR-selective agonist PHA-543613 (PHA), a novel alpha7 nAChR positive allosteric modulator compound (CompoundX) and the NMDAR antagonist memantine on the in vivo firing activity of CA1 pyramidal neurons in the rat hippocampus. Three different test conditions were applied: spontaneous firing activity, NMDA-evoked firing activity and ACh-evoked firing activity. Results showed that high but not low doses of memantine decreased NMDA-evoked firing activity, and low doses increased the spontaneous and ACh-evoked firing activity. Systemically applied PHA robustly potentiated ACh-evoked firing activity with having no effect on NMDA-evoked activity. In addition, CompoundX increased both NMDA- and ACh-evoked firing activity, having no effects on spontaneous firing of the neurons. A combination of low doses of memantine and PHA increased firing activity in all test conditions and similar effects were observed with memantine and CompoundX but without spontaneous firing activity increasing effects. Our present results demonstrate that alpha7 nAChR agents beneficially interact with Alzheimer's disease medication memantine. Moreover, positive allosteric modulators potentiate memantine effects on the right time and the right place without affecting spontaneous firing activity. All these data confirm previous behavioral evidence for the viability of combination therapies for cognitive enhancement.
