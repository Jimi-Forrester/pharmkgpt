37502897|a|Cellular identity, developmental reorganization, genomic structure modulation, and susceptibility to diseases are determined by epigenomic regulation by multiple signaling interplay. Here we demonstrate that elovanoids (ELVs), mediators derived from very-long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (VLC-PUFAs, n-3, C > 28), and their precursors in neurons in culture overcome the damage triggered by oligomeric amyloid-beta (OAbeta), erastin (ferroptosis-dependent cell death), or other insults that target epigenomic signaling. We uncover that ELVs counteract damage targeting histones H3K9 and H3K27 methylation and acetylation; tau hyperphosphorylation (pThr181, pThr217, pThr231, and pSer202/pThr205 (AT8)); senescence gene programming (p16INK4a, p27KIP, p21CIP1, and p53); DNA methylation (DNAm) modifying enzymes: TET (DNA hydroxymethylase), DNA methyltransferase, DNA demethylase, and DNAm (5mC) phenotype. Moreover, ELVs revert OAbeta-triggered telomere length (TL) attrition as well as upregulation of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) expression fostering dendrite protection and neuronal survival. Thus, ELVs modulate epigenomic resiliency by pleiotropic interrelated signaling.
