37320870|a|BACKGROUND: High expression of amyloid-beta (Abeta) in periodontal tissue could contribute to exacerbating the development of both periodontitis and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) as a periodontal pathogen expresses msRNAs, which can regulate gene transcription in host cells. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to reveal the mechanism of msRNA P.G_45033, a high copy msRNA in P. gingivalis, inducing Abeta expression in macrophages, and provide a new insight to explain the development of periodontitis, and also to explain the role of periodontal infection on AD. METHODS: The levels of glucose consumption, pyruvate and lactate productions in macrophages after transfection with msRNA P.G_45033 were detected. Miranda, TargetScan, and RNAhybrid databases were used to predict the target gene of msRNA P.G_45033, and GO analysis was conducted to describe the functions of the overlapping ones. RT2 glucose-metabolism PCR Array was used to verify the relationship between msRNA P.G_45033 and the expression of genes related to glucose metabolism. The levels of histone Kla were detected using western blotting. The levels of Abeta in the macrophages and the culture medium were detected by immunofluorescence and ELISA, respectively. RESULTS: The levels of glucose consumption, pyruvate and lactate productions were increased after transfection of msRNA P.G_45033 in macrophages. GO analysis revealed that target genes were enriched in the metabolic process. RT2 glucose-metabolism PCR Array showed the expression of genes associated with glycolysis. The results of western blotting showed that the level of histone Kla was increased in macrophages. The results of immunofluorescence and ELISA showed that Abeta levels in macrophages and culture medium were increased after transfection. CONCLUSION: The present study revealed that msRNA P.G_45033 can induce Abeta production by enhancing glycolysis and histone Kla in macrophages.
