38067489|t|Friedelin: Structure, Biosynthesis, Extraction, and Its Potential Health Impact.
38067489|a|Pharmaceutical companies are investigating more source matrices for natural bioactive chemicals. Friedelin (friedelan-3-one) is a pentacyclic triterpene isolated from various plant species from different families as well as mosses and lichen. The fundamental compounds of these friedelane triterpenoids are abundantly found in cork tissues and leaf materials of diverse plant genera such as Celastraceae, Asteraceae, Fabaceae, and Myrtaceae. They possess many pharmacological effects, including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anticancer, and antimicrobial activities. Friedelin also has an anti-insect effect and the ability to alter the soil microbial ecology, making it vital to agriculture. Ultrasound, microwave, supercritical fluid, ionic liquid, and acid hydrolysis extract friedelin with reduced environmental impact. Recently, the high demand for friedelin has led to the development of CRISPR/Cas9 technology and gene overexpression plasmids to produce friedelin using genetically engineered yeast. Friedelin with low cytotoxicity to normal cells can be the best phytochemical for the drug of choice. The review summarizes the structural interpretation, biosynthesis, physicochemical properties, quantification, and various forms of pharmacological significance.
