38434355|t|Mechanisms with network pharmacology approach of Ginsenosides in Alzheimer's disease.
38434355|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by memory loss, cognitive disorder, language dysfunction, and mental disability. The main neuropathological changes in AD mainly include amyloid plaque deposition, neurofibrillary tangles, synapse loss, and neuron reduction. However, the current anti-AD drugs do not demonstrate a favorable effect in altering the pathological course of AD. Moreover, long-term use of these drugs is usually accompanied with various side effects. Ginsenosides are the major active constituents of ginseng and have protective effects on AD through various mechanisms in both in vivo and in vitro studies. In this review, we focused on discussing the therapeutic potential effects and the mechanisms of pharmacological activities of ginsenosides in AD, to provide new insight for further research and clinical application of ginsenosides in the future. Recent studies on the pharmacological effects and mechanisms of ginsenosides were retrieved from Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, National Science and Technology Library, Wanfang Data, Elsevier, ScienceDirect, PubMed, SpringerLink, and the Web of Science database up to April 2023 using relevant keywords. Network pharmacology and bioinformatics analysis were used to predict the therapeutic effects and mechanisms of ginsenosides against AD. Ginsenosides presented a wide range of therapeutic and biological activities, including alleviating Abeta deposition, decreasing tau hyperphosphorylation, regulating the cholinergic system, resisting oxidative stress, modulating Ca2+ homeostasis, as well as anti-inflammation and anti-apoptosis in neurons, respectively. For further developing the therapeutic potential as well as clinical applications, the network pharmacology approach was combined with a summary of published studies.
