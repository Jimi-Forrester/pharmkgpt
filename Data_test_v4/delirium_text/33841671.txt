33841671|a|Previous studies have indicated that the generation of newborn hippocampal neurons is impaired in the early phase of Alzheimer's disease (AD). A potential therapeutic strategy being pursued for the treatment of AD is increasing the number of newborn neurons in the adult hippocampus. Recent studies have demonstrated that ginkgo biloba extract (EGb 761) plays a neuroprotective role by preventing memory loss in many neurodegenerative diseases. However, the extent of EGb 761's protective role in the AD process is unclear. In this study, different doses of EGb 761 (0, 10, 20, and 30 mg/kg; intraperitoneal injections once every day for four months) were tested on 5xFAD mice. After consecutive 4-month injections, mice were tested in learning memory tasks, Abeta, and neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus (DG) of hippocampus and morphological characteristics of neurons in DG of hippocampus. Results indicated that EGb 761 (20 and 30 mg/kg) ameliorated memory deficits. Further analysis indicated that EGb 761 can reduce the number of Abeta positive signals in 5xFAD mice, increase the number of newborn neurons, and increase dendritic branching and density of dendritic spines in 5xFAD mice compared to nontreated 5xFAD mice. It was concluded that EGb 761 plays a protective role in the memory deficit of 5xFAD mice.
