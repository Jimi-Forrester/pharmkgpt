33552397|a|BACKGROUND: Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), including MMP-9, are an integral part of the immune response and are upregulated in response to a variety of stimuli. New details continue to emerge concerning the mechanistic and regulatory pathways that mediate MMP-9 secretion. There is significant evidence for regulation of inflammation by dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and 3',5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), thus investigation of how these two molecules may regulate both MMP-9 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) secretion by human monocytes was of high interest. The hypothesis tested in this study was that DMSO and cAMP regulate MMP-9 and TNFalpha secretion by distinct mechanisms. AIM: To investigate the regulation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated MMP-9 and tumor necrosis factor alpha secretion in THP-1 human monocytes by dimethyl sulfoxide and cAMP. METHODS: The paper describes a basic research study using THP-1 human monocyte cells. All experiments were conducted at the University of Missouri-St. Louis in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry. Human monocyte cells were grown, cultured, and prepared for experiments in the University of Missouri-St. Louis Cell Culture Facility as per accepted guidelines. Cells were treated with LPS for selected exposure times and the conditioned medium was collected for analysis of MMP-9 and TNFalpha production. Inhibitors including DMSO, cAMP regulators, and anti-TNFalpha antibody were added to the cells prior to LPS treatment. MMP-9 secretion was analyzed by gel electrophoresis/western blot and quantitated by ImageJ software. TNFalpha secretion was analyzed by enzyme-linked immuno sorbent assay. All data is presented as the average and standard error for at least 3 trials. Statistical analysis was done using a two-tailed paired Student t-test. P values less than 0.05 were considered significant and designated as such in the Figures. LPS and cAMP regulators were from Sigma-Aldrich, MMP-9 standard and antibody and TNFalpha antibodies were from R&D Systems, and amyloid-beta peptide was from rPeptide. RESULTS: In our investigation of MMP-9 secretion from THP-1 human monocytes, we made the following findings. Inclusion of DMSO in the cell treatment inhibited LPS-induced MMP-9, but not TNFalpha, secretion. Inclusion of DMSO in the cell treatment at different concentrations inhibited LPS-induced MMP-9 secretion in a dose-dependent fashion. A cell-permeable cAMP analog, dibutyryl cAMP, inhibited both LPS-induced MMP-9 and TNFalpha secretion. Pretreatment of the cells with the adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin inhibited LPS-induced MMP-9 and TNFalpha secretion. Pretreatment of the cells with the general cAMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor IBMX reduced LPS-induced MMP-9 and TNFalpha in a dose-dependent fashion. Pre-treatment of monocytes with an anti-TNFalpha antibody blocked LPS-induced MMP-9 and TNFalpha secretion. Amyloid-beta peptide induced MMP-9 secretion, which occurred much later than TNFalpha secretion. The latter two findings strongly suggested an upstream role for TNFalpha in mediating LPS-stimulate MMP-9 secretion. CONCLUSION: The cumulative data indicated that MMP-9 secretion was a distinct process from TNFalpha secretion and occurred downstream. First, DMSO inhibited MMP-9, but not TNFalpha, suggesting that the MMP-9 secretion process was selectively altered. Second, cAMP inhibited both MMP-9 and TNFalpha with a similar potency, but at different monocyte cell exposure time points. The pattern of cAMP inhibition for these two molecules suggested that MMP-9 secretion lies downstream of TNFalpha and that TNFalpha may a key component of the pathway leading to MMP-9 secretion. This temporal relationship fit a model whereby early TNFalpha secretion directly led to later MMP-9 secretion. Lastly, antibody-blocking of TNFalpha diminished MMP-9 secretion, suggesting a direct link between TNFalpha secretion and MMP-9 secretion.
