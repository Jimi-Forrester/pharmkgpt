34585217|t|The Association between Peanut and Peanut Butter Consumption and Cognitive Function among Community-Dwelling Older Adults.
34585217|a|BACKGROUND: Many studies have focused on the association between diet and cognitive function. While a subset of these studies focused on a diet that includes tree nuts (TN), there is limited data on the association between peanut and peanut butter consumption (P/PB) and cognitive health. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the association of P/PB consumption and cognitive function. DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional study using 2011-2014 NHANES data. PARTICIPANTS/SETTING: Individuals 60-80 years old in 2011-2014 NHANES who had two 24-hour dietary recalls, cognitive function tests, and education level and with no history of stroke. MEASUREMENTS: P/PB and TN consumption was measured as well as participant performance on the CERAD Word Learning subtest (CERAD W-L), Animal Fluency test (AFT), and the Digit Symbol Substitution test (DSST). Scores from the three cognitive tests were dichotomized. Individuals were classified as either P/PB consumers or non-consumers and TN consumers or non-consumers. Logistic regression models examined associations between P/PB consumption, tree nut consumption, and cognitive function with adjusted models including age, sex, and education as covariates. RESULTS: A total of 2,454 adults, aged 60-80 years old (mean age=69.4) participated. Approximately half were male (48%), 18% were P/PB consumers, and 14% consumed TN. Participants who did not consume P/PB were more likely to do poorly on the CERAD W-L (adjusted OR=1.56, 95% CI 1.24-1.97; p<0.05), AFT (adjusted OR=1.29, 95% CI 1.03-1.61; p<0.05), and DSST (adjusted OR=1.43, 95% CI 1.12-1.82; p<0.05) when compared to those who did consume P/PB. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest an association between P/PB consumption and cognitive function; however, this is a cross sectional study and a causal relationship cannot be established. More studies are needed to determine causality.
