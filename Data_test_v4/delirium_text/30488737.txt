30488737|t|Progression in Vascular Cognitive Impairment: Pathogenesis, Neuroimaging Evaluation, and Treatment.
30488737|a|Vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) defines an entire spectrum of neurologic disorders from mild cognitive impairment to dementia caused by cerebral vascular disease. The pathogenesis of VCI includes ischemic factors (e.g., large vessel occlusion and small vessel dysfunction); hemorrhagic factors (e.g., intracerebral hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage); and other factors (combined with Alzheimer's disease). Clinical evaluations of VCI mainly refer to neuropsychological testing and imaging assessments, including structural and functional neuroimaging, with different advantages. At present, the main treatment for VCI focuses on neurological protection, cerebral blood flow reconstruction, and neurological rehabilitation, such as pharmacological treatment, revascularization, and cognitive training. In this review, we discuss the pathogenesis, neuroimaging evaluation, and treatment of VCI.
