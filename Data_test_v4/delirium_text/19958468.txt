19958468|t|Masking of transmembrane-based retention signals controls ER export of gamma-secretase.
19958468|a|gamma-Secretase is critically involved in the Notch pathway and in Alzheimer's disease. The four subunits of gamma-secretase assemble in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and unassembled subunits are retained/retrieved to the ER by specific signals. We here describe a novel ER-retention/retrieval signal in the transmembrane domain (TMD) 4 of presenilin 1, a subunit of gamma-secretase. TMD4 also is essential for complex formation, conferring a dual role for this domain. Likewise, TMD1 of Pen2 is bifunctional as well. It carries an ER-retention/retrieval signal and is important for complex assembly by binding to TMD4. The two TMDs directly interact with each other and mask their respective ER-retention/retrieval signals, allowing surface transport of reporter proteins. Our data suggest a model how assembly of Pen2 into the nascent gamma-secretase complex could mask TMD-based ER-retention/retrieval signals to allow plasma membrane transport of fully assembled gamma-secretase.
