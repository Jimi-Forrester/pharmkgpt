38688484|t|New horizons in undergraduate geriatric medicine education.
38688484|a|Current projections show that between 2000 and 2050, increasing proportions of older individuals will be cared for by a smaller number of healthcare workers, which will exacerbate the existing challenges faced by those who support this patient demographic. This review of a collection of Age and Ageing papers on the topic in the past 10 years explores (1) what best practice geriatrics education is and (2) how careers in geriatrics could be made more appealing to improve recruitment and retention. Based on these deeper understandings, we consider, as clinician educators, how to close the gap both pragmatically and theoretically. We point out paradigm shifting solutions that include innovations at the Undergraduate level, use of simulation, incorporation of learner and patient perspectives, upskilling professionals outside of Geriatrics and integration of practice across disciplines through Interprofessional Learning. We also identify an education research methodological gap. Specifically, there is an abundance of simple descriptive or justification studies but few clarification education studies; the latter are essential to develop fresh insights into how Undergraduate students can learn more effectively to meet the needs of the global ageing challenge. A case of improving understanding in delirium education is presented as an illustrative example of a new approach to exploring at greater depth education and outlines suggested directions for the future.
