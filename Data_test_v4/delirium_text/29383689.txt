29383689|a|Poor Mg status is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), and the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we provided the first evidence that elevated Mg levels significantly reduced the blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability and regulated its function in vitro. Transient receptor potential melastatin 7 (TRPM7) and magnesium transporter subtype 1 (MagT1) were two major cellular receptors mediating entry of extracellular Mg2+ into the cells. Elevated Mg levels also induced an accelerated clearance of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) from the brain to the blood side via BBB transcytosis through low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) and phosphatidylinositol binding clathrin assembly protein (PICALM), while reduced the influx of Abeta from the blood to the brain side involving receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) and caveolae. Mg enhanced BBB barrier properties and overall expression of LRP1 and PICALM whereas reduced that of RAGE and caveolin-1. Apical-to-basolateral and vice versa steady-state Abeta flux achieved an equilibrium of 18 and 0.27 fmol/min/cm2, respectively, about 30 min after the initial addition of physiological levels of free Abeta. Knockdown of caveolin-1 or disruption of caveolae membrane microdomains reduced RAGE-mediated influx significantly, but not LRP1-mediated efflux of Abeta. Stimulating endothelial cells with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) enhanced caveolin-1 phosphorylation and RAGE expression. Co-immunoprecipitation demonstrated that RAGE, but not LRP1, was physically associated with caveolin-1. Thus, Mg can reduce BBB permeability and promote BBB clearance of Abeta from the brain by increasing the expression of LRP1 and PICALM while reducing the level of RAGE and caveolin-1.
