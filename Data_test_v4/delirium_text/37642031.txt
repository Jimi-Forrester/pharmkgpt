37642031|t|Prognostic Value of Hospital Frailty Risk Score and Clinical Outcomes in Patients Undergoing Revascularization for Critical Limb-Threatening Ischemia.
37642031|a|Background The impact of medical record-based frailty assessment on clinical outcomes in patients undergoing revascularization for critical limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) is unknown. Methods and Results This study included patients with CLTI aged >=18 years from the nationwide readmissions database 2016 to 2018 who underwent endovascular revascularization (ER) or surgical revascularization (SR). The hospital frailty risk score, a previously validated International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Edition, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) claims-based score, was used to categorize patients into low- (<5), intermediate- (5-15), and high-risk (>15) frailty categories. Primary outcomes were in-hospital mortality and major amputation at 6 months. A total of 64 338 patients were identified who underwent ER (82.3%) or SR (17.7%) for CLTI. The mean (SD) age of the cohort was 69.3 (11.8) years, and 63% of patients were male. This study found a nonlinear association between hospital frailty risk score and in-hospital mortality and 6-month major amputation. In both ER and SR cohorts, the intermediate- and high-risk groups were associated with a significantly higher risk of in-hospital mortality (high-risk group: ER: odds ratio [OR], 7.2 [95% CI, 4.4-11.6], P<0.001; SR: OR, 28.6 [95% CI, 3.4-237.6], P=0.002) and major amputation at 6 months (high-risk group: ER: hazard ratio [HR], 1.6 [95% CI, 1.5-1.7], P<0.001; SR: HR, 1.7 [95% CI, 1.4-2.2], P<0.001) compared with the low-risk group. Conclusions The hospital frailty risk score, generated from the medical record, can identify frailty and predict in-hospital mortality and 6-month major amputation in patients undergoing ER or SR for CLTI. Further studies are needed to assess if this score can be incorporated into clinical decision-making in patients undergoing revascularization for CLTI.
