35701404|t|Large-scale genomic analyses reveal insights into pleiotropy across circulatory system diseases and nervous system disorders.
35701404|a|Clinical and epidemiological studies have shown that circulatory system diseases and nervous system disorders often co-occur in patients. However, genetic susceptibility factors shared between these disease categories remain largely unknown. Here, we characterized pleiotropy across 107 circulatory system and 40 nervous system traits using an ensemble of methods in the eMERGE Network and UK Biobank. Using a formal test of pleiotropy, five genomic loci demonstrated statistically significant evidence of pleiotropy. We observed region-specific patterns of direction of genetic effects for the two disease categories, suggesting potential antagonistic and synergistic pleiotropy. Our findings provide insights into the relationship between circulatory system diseases and nervous system disorders which can provide context for future prevention and treatment strategies.
