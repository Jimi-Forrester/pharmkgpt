29381861|t|Discovery of Selective, Substrate-Competitive, and Passive Membrane Permeable Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3beta Inhibitors: Synthesis, Biological Evaluation, and Molecular Modeling of New C-Glycosylflavones.
29381861|a|Glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) is a key enzyme responsible for tau hyperphosphorylation and is a viable therapeutic target of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We developed a new class of GSK-3beta inhibitors based on the 6- C-glycosylflavone isoorientin (1). The new inhibitors are passive membrane permeable and constitutively attenuate GSK-3beta mediated tau hyperphosphorylation and amyloid neurotoxicity in an AD cellular model. Enzymatic assays and kinetic studies demonstrated that compound 30 is a GSK-3beta substrate-competitive inhibitor with distinct kinase selectivity, isoform-selectivity and over 310-fold increased potency as compared to 1. Structure-activity relationship analyses and in silico modeling suggest the mechanism of actions by which the hydrophobic, pi-cation, and orthogonal multipolar interactions of 30 with the substrate site are critical for the GSK-3beta inhibition and selectivity. The results provide new insights into GSK-3beta drug discovery. The new inhibitors are valuable chemical probes and drug leads with therapeutic potential to tackle AD and other GSK-3beta relevant diseases.
