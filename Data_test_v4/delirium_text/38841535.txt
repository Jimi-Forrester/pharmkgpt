38841535|t|Lymphovenous Anastomosis for the External and Internal Types of Head and Neck Lymphedema: A Case Series and Preliminary Clinical Results.
38841535|a|Background: Head and neck lymphedema (HNL), including external and internal types, could be a possible consequence for patients who have received neck dissection and radiotherapy for head and neck cancer. Initially, the common presentations are heaviness or tightness, followed by swelling in appearance, or difficulty speaking and swallowing in internal edema cases. Lymphovenous anastomosis (LVA) is an established approach to treat extremity lymphedema. We hereby present our preliminary experience in using LVA to treat HNL. Methods: Between March 2021 and January 2024, six patients with HNL were treated with LVA via a preauricular or submandibular incision of the obstructed side. Lymphedema Symptom Intensity and Distress Surveys-Head and Neck (LSIDS-H&N) were used for evaluation. In addition, for the external type, MD Anderson Cancer Center Head and Neck Lymphedema (MDACC HNL) rating scale was used for evaluation. For the internal type, Swallowing Quality of Life was used for evaluation. Results: With an average follow-up period of 15.4 +- 15.9 months, LSIDS-H&N improved from 1.11 +- 0.54 to 0.44 +- 0.66 (P = 0.02). For patients with the external type, within an average follow-up period of 15 +- 16.1 months, the MDACC HNL rating scale improved from level 2 to 0 or 1a (P = 0.008). For patients with the internal type, within an average follow-up period of 21 +- 17.3 months, Swallowing Quality of Life improved from 130.5 +- 9.2 to 151 +- 19.8 (P = 0.5). Conclusions: Based on our preliminary results, LVA could be a potential solution to both external and internal HNL.
