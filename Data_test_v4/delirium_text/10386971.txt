10386971|t|Alzheimer's disease: correlation of the suppression of beta-amyloid peptide secretion from cultured cells with inhibition of the chymotrypsin-like activity of the proteasome.
10386971|a|Peptide aldehyde inhibitors of the chymotrypsin-like activity of the proteasome (CLIP) such as N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-Nle-H (or ALLN) have been shown previously to inhibit the secretion of beta-amyloid peptide (A beta) from cells. To evaluate more fully the role of the proteasome in this process, we have tested the effects on A beta formation of a much wider range of peptide-based inhibitors of CLIP than published previously. The inhibitors tested included several peptide boronates, some of which proved to be the most potent peptide-based inhibitors of beta-amyloid production reported so far. We found that the ability of the peptide aldehyde and boronate inhibitors to suppress A beta formation from cells correlated extremely well with their potency as CLIP inhibitors. Thus, we conclude that the proteasome may be involved either directly or indirectly in A beta formation.
