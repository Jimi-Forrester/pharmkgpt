35480964|t|The Association of Plasma Amyloid-beta and Cognitive Decline in Cognitively Unimpaired Population.
35480964|a|Purpose: This study investigates the relationship between baseline plasma Abeta and cognitive decline during follow-up in cognitively unimpaired population. Materials and Methods: Cognitively unimpaired population was selected from people who lived in the suburbs of Xi'an, China. The levels of plasma Abeta1-42 and Abeta1-40 were tested using commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The mini-mental state examination (MMSE) and neuropsychological battery were used to assess cognition. Two years later, MMSE was tested again, and significant cognitive decline was defined as a decrease in MMSE scores >=5 points. Logistic regression analysis was performed to analyze the relationship between baseline plasma Abeta and cognitive change during the two-year follow-up. Results: A total of 1144 participants completed the study, among whom 59 subjects (5.2%) presented significant cognitive decline. The high plasma Abeta1-42 level group had more significant cognitive decline (P = 0.023). Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that significant cognitive decline was associated with the high levels of baseline plasma Abeta1-42 (OR = 1.043, 95% CI: 1.005-1.083, P = 0.026). However, significant cognitive decline was not associated with baseline plasma Abeta1-40 levels and Abeta1-42 /Abeta1-40 ratio. Conclusion: Population with high level of baseline plasma Abeta1-42 manifested significant cognitive decline over 2 years; however, further investigation on the dynamics of plasma Abeta and long-term follow-up are needed.
