24204131|a|BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to compare apolipoprotein E epsilon4 (Apo E epsilon4) and apolipoprotein E epsilon2 (Apo E epsilon2) as predictors of cognitive and functional trajectories over 30 months. METHODS: This prospective cohort study included 287 community-dwelling memory clinic patients with dementia, mild cognitive impairment, or no cognitive impairment. The Addenbrooke Cognitive Examination, Mini-Mental State Examination, Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Delirium Index, and Nottingham Instrumental Activities of Daily Living tests were administered to each subject. RESULTS: One hundred and nine subjects (40%) carried Apo E epsilon4 and 48 (16.7%) carried Apo E epsilon2. One hundred and nine epsilon4-positive subjects differed significantly from 178 epsilon4-negative subjects in 19/52 comparisons (36.5%), whereas 46 Apo E epsilon2-positive subjects had 0/52 significant differences from 239 epsilon2-negative subjects (P < 0.0001). The variables most affected by epsilon4 were the Delirium Index and Mini-Mental State Examination. Instrumental Activities of Daily Living score and residence were unrelated to Apo E epsilon4 or epsilon2. CONCLUSION: Apo E epsilon4 positivity predicted four cognitive scores measured every 6 months over 30 months. Apo E epsilon2 scores predicted none of 52 comparisons.
