11352330|t|The Behavior Problems Checklist-Spanish: a preliminary study of a new scale for the assessment of depressive symptoms and disruptive behaviors in Hispanic patients with dementia.
11352330|a|Few instruments are available with which to measure behavioral and psychological signs and symptoms in Hispanic patients with dementia. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to develop and evaluate a 17-item scale adapted from the Revised Memory and Behavior Problems Checklist. This measure, the Behavior Problems Checklist-Spanish (BPC-S), assesses caregiver-reported symptoms of depression and disruption in patients with dementia. The sample for this study comprised 27 Spanish-speaking Hispanic patients and their family caregivers evaluated at a university-affiliated memory disorders center. All patients met diagnostic criteria for possible or probable Alzheimer's disease as set forth by the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Diseases and Stroke-Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association. Satisfactory convergent validity, discriminant validity, and internal consistency reliability were demonstrated for the Depression and Disruption subscales of the BPC-S. Both of these neuropsychiatric disturbances were related to heightened levels of caregiver burden. The results of this preliminary study suggest the BPC-S is a brief, psychometrically sound caregiver-report instrument to assess symptoms of mood disturbance and behavioral disruption in Hispanic patients with dementia. This instrument may have utility for both clinical and research purposes.
