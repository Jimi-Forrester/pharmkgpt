8314090|a|We have previously shown that lymphocytes from Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients are hypersensitive to ionising radiation, as revealed by their higher levels of dicentrics than those from age-matched, normal individuals. We have now examined the sensitivity of these cells to N-methyl-N-nitrosourea or methyl methanesulphonate, using a variety of assays, namely unscheduled DNA synthesis, viability, sister chromatid exchange and, via high performance liquid chromatography, level of methylation and repair of the adducts, 7-methylguanine, 0(6)-methylguanine and 3-methyladenine. We have found that AD lymphocytes and age-matched normal lymphocytes respond similarly to methylation damage, as assessed by all these techniques.
