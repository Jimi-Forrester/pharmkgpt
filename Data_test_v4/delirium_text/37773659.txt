37773659|t|Analysis of the Influencing Factors of Delirium after PCI for Acute Myocardial Infarction and its Impact on the Quality of Life of Patients.
37773659|a|Objective: Delirium is a common and serious issue in patients recovering from percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). It can lead to longer hospital stays, increased mortality, and decreased quality of life. This study aims to investigate different nursing interventions to improve care for post-PCI patients by reducing the incidence and duration of delirium. Methods: Between December 2021 and April 2023, we enrolled patients who underwent PCI surgery for acute myocardial infarction at our hospital as study participants. Utilizing a clinical randomized controlled trial design, we allocated these patients randomly into either the intervention group or the control group. The control group received conventional nursing care, while the intervention group received routine nursing care augmented by family visit nursing care, encompassing emotional support, education, and enhanced communication with family members. Upon the completion of all intervention measures, we assessed the incidence of delirium in post-PCI patients using the Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS) and the ICU Ambiguity Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU). Furthermore, we evaluated the patients' quality of life using the US Medical Bureau's Quality of Life Health Survey (SF-36). Result: Significant differences were observed in Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS) scores at 24 and 48 hours post-PCI, favoring the intervention group (P < .05). The intervention group also exhibited a lower incidence of delirium at 24 hours (P < .05) and a significantly shorter delirium duration (P < .05). While baseline quality of life scores did not differ significantly between the groups, post-intervention, the intervention group demonstrated significantly higher quality of life scores. These results underscore the positive impact of combined nursing interventions on sedation levels, delirium incidence and duration, and overall quality of life for post-PCI patients. Conclusion: The combined approach of routine nursing care and home visit interventions significantly reduced delirium incidence and duration in post-PCI patients. This personalized care strategy emphasizes patient well-being and is indicative of a broader shift towards individualized healthcare. It highlights the potential for enhanced patient outcomes and improved quality of life in the context of post-PCI patient management.
