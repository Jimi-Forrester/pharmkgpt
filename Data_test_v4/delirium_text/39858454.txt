39858454|t|Urinary Proteome and Exosome Analysis Protocol for the Discovery of Respiratory Diseases Biomarkers.
39858454|a|This study aims to develop a protocol for respiratory disease-associated biomarker discovery by combining urine proteome studies with urinary exosome components analysis (i.e., miRNAs). To achieve this, urine was DTT treated to decrease uromodulin, then concentrated and ultracentrifuged. Proteomic analyses of exosome-free urine were performed using LC-MS/MS. Simultaneously, miRNA expression from urine exosomes was measured using either RTqPCR (pre-amplification) or nCounter Nanostring (non-amplication) analyses. We detected 548 different proteins in exosome-free urine samples (N = 5) with high confidence (FDR < 1%), many of them being expressed in different non-renal tissues. Specifically, lung-related proteins were overrepresented (Fold enrichment = 1.31; FDR = 0.0335) compared to whole human proteome, and 10-15% were already described as protein biomarkers for several pulmonary diseases. Urine proteins identified belong to several functional categories important in respiratory pathology. We could confirm the expression of miRNAs previously connected to respiratory diseases (i.e., miR-16-5p, miR-21-5p, miR-146a-5p, and miR-215-5p) in urine exosomes by RTqPCR. Finally, we detected 333 miRNAs using Nanostring, 15 of them up-regulated in T2high asthma (N = 4) compared to T2low asthma (N = 4) and healthy subjects (N = 4). Therefore, this protocol combining the urinary proteome (exosome free) with the study of urinary exosome components (i.e., miRNAs) holds great potential for molecular biomarker discovery of non-renal and particularly respiratory pathologies.
