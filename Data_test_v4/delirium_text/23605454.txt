23605454|a|The prevalence of diabetes is increasing due to aging of the population and increasing obesity. In the developed world, there is an epidemiologic shift from diabetes being a disease of middle age to being a disease of older people due to increased life expectancy. In old age, diabetes is associated with high comorbidity burden and increased prevalence of geriatric syndromes in addition to the traditional vascular complications. Therefore, comprehensive geriatric assessment should be performed on initial diagnosis of diabetes. Due to the heterogeneous nature of older people with diabetes and variations in their functional status, comorbidities, and life expectancy, therapeutic interventions, and glycemic targets should be individualized taking into consideration patients' preferences and putting quality of life at the heart of their care plans.
