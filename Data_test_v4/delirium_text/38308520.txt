38308520|a|The excitation-inhibition imbalance manifesting as epileptic activities in Alzheimer's disease is gaining more and more attention, and several potentially involved cellular and molecular pathways are currently under investigation. Based on in vitro studies, dopamine D1-type receptors in the anterior cingulate cortex and the hippocampus have been proposed to participate in this peculiar co-morbidity in mouse models of amyloidosis. Here, we tested the implication of dopaminergic transmission in vivo in the Tg2576 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease by monitoring epileptic activities via intracranial EEG before and after treatment with dopamine antagonists. Our results show that neither the D1-like dopamine receptor antagonist SCH23390 nor the D2-like dopamine receptor antagonist haloperidol reduces the frequency of epileptic activities. While requiring further investigation, our results indicate that on a systemic level, dopamine receptors are not significantly contributing to epilepsy observed in vivo in this mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
