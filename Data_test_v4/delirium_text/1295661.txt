1295661|t|Changes in the glucose transporter of brain capillaries.
1295661|a|Brain capillary endothelium has a high density of the GLUT-1 facilitative glucose transporter protein. This is reasonable in view of the brain's high metabolic rate for glucose and its isolation behind unique capillaries with blood-brain barrier properties. Thus, the brain endothelium, which constitutes less than 0.1% of the brain weight, has to transport glucose for the much larger mass of surrounding neurons and glia. I describe here the changes that occur in the density of glucose transporters in brain capillaries of subjects with Alzheimer disease, where there is a decreased cerebral metabolic rate for glucose, and in a novel clinical entity characterized by defective glucose transport at the blood-brain barrier. In subjects with Alzheimer disease, cerebral microvessels showed a marked decrease in the density of the glucose transporter when compared with age-matched controls, but there was no change in the density of glucose transporters in erythrocyte membranes. Thus, I believe that the decreased density of glucose transporters in the brains of subjects with Alzheimer disease is the result rather than the cause of the disease. In contradistinction, the primary defect in glucose transport at the blood-brain barrier in subjects with the recently described entity is associated with decreased density of GLUT-1 in erythrocyte membranes.
