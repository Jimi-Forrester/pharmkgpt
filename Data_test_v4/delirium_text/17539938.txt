17539938|a|Polymorphisms of prion protein gene (PRNP) at codons 129 and 219 play an important role in the susceptibility to Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). Alzheimer's disease (AD) and prion diseases, such as CJD, are both characterized by the accumulation of abnormally folded proteins in the brain. An association between sporadic AD and the PRNP polymorphism at codon 129 has been reported in several studies, but other studies have failed to confirm an association. To investigate whether PRNP polymorphisms are associated with an increased risk for developing sporadic AD in the Korean population, we compared the genotype, allele, and haplotype frequencies of PRNP polymorphisms in 271 sporadic AD patients with those in 236 healthy Koreans. Our study does not show a significant difference in PRNP genotype, allele, and haplotype frequency at codons 129 and 219 between sporadic AD and normal controls. Analyses stratifying by age at disease onset, and gender also failed to reveal any association between these polymorphisms and sporadic AD. These results indicate that these PRNP polymorphisms have no direct influence on the susceptibility to sporadic AD in the Korean population.
