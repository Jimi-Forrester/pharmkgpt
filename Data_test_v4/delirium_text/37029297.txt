37029297|t|Association between the AKT1 single nucleotide polymorphism (rs2498786, rs2494752 and rs5811155) and microscopic polyangiitis risk in a Chinese population.
37029297|a|Microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) is an autoimmune disease, characterized by ANCA in blood and necrotizing inflammation of small and medium-sized vessels, one of the three clinical phenotypes of ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV). Autophagy has been confirmed to be involved in the pathogenesis of AAV. AKT1 is one of the autophagy-regulated proteins. Its single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are associated with multiple immune-related diseases, but there are rarely studies in AAV. The incidence rate of AAV has a notable geographic difference, and MPA is predominant in China. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between AKT1 SNP and MPA risk. Genotypes of 8 loci in AKT1 were evaluated by multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and high-throughput sequencing in 416 people, including 208 MPA patients and 208 healthy volunteers from Guangxi in China. Additionally, data of 387 healthy volunteers from China were obtained from the 1000Genomes Project on public database. Differences were observed between the loci (rs2498786, rs2494752, and rs5811155) genotypes in AKT1 and MPA risk (P = 7.0 x 10-4, P = 3.0 x 10-4, and P = 5.9 x 10-5, respectively). A negative association was detected in the Dominant model (P = 1.2 x 10-3, P = 2.0 x 10-4 and P = 3.6 x 10-5, respectively). A haplotype (G-G-T) was associated with MPA risk negatively (P = 7.0 x 10-4). This study suggests that alleles (rs2498786 G, rs2494752 G and rs5811155 insT) are protective factors for MPA and alleles (rs2494752 G and rs5811155 insT) for MPO-ANCA in patients with MPA. There is a haplotype (G-G-T), which is a protective factor for MPA. It suggests that the role of AKT1 in MPA/AAV needs further study to provide more intervention targets for MPA/AAV.
