39509049|t|What Can We Learn About Alzheimer's Disease from People with Down Syndrome?
39509049|a|Down syndrome (DS) is the most frequent cause of intellectual disability of genetic origin, estimated to affect about 1 in 700 babies born worldwide (CDC 2023). In Europe and the United States, current estimates indicate a population prevalence of 5.6 and 6.7 per 10,000 individuals, respectively, which translates to more than 200,000 people in the United States, more than 400,000 people in Europe, and approximately six million worldwide. Advances in healthcare and the treatment of accompanying conditions have significantly prolonged the lifespan of those with DS over the past 50 years. Consequently, there is a pressing need to address the challenges associated with ageing among this population, with Alzheimer's disease (AD) being the primary concern. In this chapter, we will review the significance of studying this population to understand AD biology, the insights gained on AD in DS (DSAD), and how this knowledge can help us understand the AD not only in DS but also in the general population. We will conclude by exploring the objectives that remain to be accomplished.
