33065212|a|The dysregulation of lipid homeostasis is emerging as a hallmark of many CNS diseases. As aberrant protein regulation is suggested to be a shared pathological feature amongst many neurodegenerative conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and Huntington's disease (HD), disruptions in neuronal lipid processing may contribute to disease progression in the CNS. Specifically, given the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) dual role in lipid homeostasis as well as protein quality control (PQC) via unfolded protein response (UPR), lipid dysregulation in the CNS may converge on ER functioning and constitute a crucial mechanism underlying aberrant protein aggregation. In the current review, we discuss the diverse roles of lipid species as essential components of the CNS. Moreover, given the importance of both lipid dysregulation and protein aggregation in pathology of CNS diseases, we attempt to assess the potential downstream cross-talk between lipid dysregulation and ER dependent PQC mechanisms, with special focus on HIV-associated neurodegenerative disorders (HAND).
