30656014|t|Twenty-four-hour continuous and remote monitoring of respiratory rate using a medical radar system for the early detection of pneumonia in symptomatic elderly bedridden hospitalized patients.
30656014|a|Respiratory rate is often measured manually and discontinuously by counting of chest wall movements in routine clinical practice. We introduce a novel approach to investigate respiration dynamics using a noncontact medical radar system for identifying patient at risk of infection. The system enables early detection of pneumonia in bedridden hospitalized patients.
