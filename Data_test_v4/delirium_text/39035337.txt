39035337|t|The mechanisms of Porphyromonas gingivalis-derived outer membrane vesicles-induced neurotoxicity and microglia activation.
39035337|a|Background/purpose: Periodontitis is associated with various systemic diseases, potentially facilitated by the passage of Porphyromonas gingivalis outer membrane vesicles (Pg-OMVs). Several recent studies have suggested a connection between Pg-OMVs and neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, but the precise causal relationship remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the mechanisms underlying these associations using in vitro models. Materials and methods: Isolated Pg-OMVs were characterized by morphology, size, and gingipain activity. We exposed SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells and BV-2 microglial cells to various concentrations of Pg-OMVs. Cell morphology, a 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and Western blot analysis were used to evaluate the cellular mechanism underlying Pg-OMV-induced neurotoxicity in neuronal cells and inflammatory responses in microglial cells. Results: Exposure to Pg-OMVs induced neurotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cells, as evidenced by cellular shrinkage, reduced viability, activation of apoptotic pathways, and diminished neuronal differentiation markers. Gingipain inhibition mitigated these effects, suggesting that gingipain mediates Pg-OMVs-induced neurotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cells. Our research on neuroinflammation suggests that upon endocytosis of Pg-OMVs by BV-2 cells, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) can modulate the production of inducible nitric oxide synthase and tumor necrosis factor-alpha by activating pathways that involve phosphorylated AKT and the phosphorylated JNK pathway. Conclusion: Our study demonstrated that following the endocytosis of Pg-OMVs, gingipain can induce neurotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cells. Furthermore, the Pg-OMVs-associated LPS can trigger neuroinflammation via AKT and JNK signaling pathways in BV-2 cells.
