37388425|t|Two-year Outcomes of Ventricular-demand Leadless Pacemaker Therapy for Heart Block After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.
37388425|a|Ventricular-demand leadless pacemakers (VVI-LPMs) have often been used as an alternative to atrioventricular (AV) synchronous transvenous pacemakers (DDD-TPMs) in patients with high-grade AV block following transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). However, the clinical outcomes of this unusual usage are not elucidated. Patients who received permanent pacemakers (PPMs) owing to new-onset high-grade AV block after TAVR from September 2017 to August 2020 at a high-volume center in Japan were included in the analysis, and the clinical courses of VVI-LPM and DDD-TPM implants through 2 years of follow-up were compared retrospectively. Out of 413 consecutive patients who underwent TAVR, 51 (12%) patients received a PPM. After excluding 8 patients with chronic atrial fibrillation (AF), 3 with sick sinus syndrome, and 1 with incomplete data, 17 VVI-LPMs and 22 DDD-TPMs were included in our final cohort. The VVI-LPM group had lower serum albumin levels (3.2 +- 0.5 vs. 3.9 +- 0.4 g/dL, P < .01) than the DDD-TPM group. Follow-up revealed no significant differences between the 2 groups in terms of the incidence of late device-related adverse events (0% vs. 5%, log-rank P = .38) and new-onset AF (6% vs. 9%, log-rank P = .75); however, there were increases in the rates of all-cause death (41% vs. 5%, log-rank P < .01) and heart failure rehospitalization (24% vs. 0%, log-rank P = .01) in the VVI-LPM group. This small retrospective study reveals favorable post-procedural complication rates but higher all-cause mortality with VVI-LPM compared to DDD-TPM therapy for high-grade AV block after TAVR at 2 years of follow-up.
