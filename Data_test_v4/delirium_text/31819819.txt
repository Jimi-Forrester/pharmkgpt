31819819|a|BACKGROUND: Following spine surgery, different types of inhalational anesthetic agents can result in postoperative delirium (POD) that can increase perioperative/postoperative morbidity. Here, we compared the incidence of POD in adults undergoing spine surgery anesthetized with isoflurane versus desflurane. METHODS: A prospective randomized double-blind clinical trial for patients undergoing spinal surgery was performed in 60 adults (aged 18-65 years); they were randomized to receive isoflurane or desflurane. On postoperative days 1 and 3, the diagnosis and severity of POD utilized 3D-Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) and CAM-severity delirium severity scores to assess patients' status. Multiple other variables which may have influenced the frequency/severity of POD were also studied. RESULTS: For the two groups, the incidence of POD utilizing isoflurane and desflurane was similar on postoperative days 1 (10% vs. 13.3%, P > 0.05) and 3 (6.6% vs. 0%, P > 0.05). The severity scores of POD for both anesthetic agents were also similar on postoperative days 1 (1.5 vs. 1) and 3 (0.5 vs. 0.5). In addition, there was no significant association of POD with other perioperative factors. CONCLUSION: A significant number of patients undergoing spine surgery experience POD. However, the incidence and severity of POD remained similar when utilizing either isoflurane or desflurane.
