10598296|t|[Acute psychosis in Reunion Island. Retrospective study performed on the 4th sector of psychiatry (west region) on the year 1997].
10598296|a|A retrospective study in the West psychiatry service in Reunion island (an area with 85,000 inhabitants) includes 19 files for patients hospitalized for the first time during the year 1997 with a diagnosis of acute psychosis. It excludes the troubles linked to the acute or chronic use of alcohol and the mental aberrations. This study regroups a young population, basically male and more often disadvantaged. The deliriums are stereotyped, essentially borrowed from the local culture. Two important points become visible: in more then half of the cases, drug taking (polyintoxication systematically associating cannabis) is evoked as the main etiologic factor. The prognosis in the short term of those acute psychosis is good, with a rapid regression of symptomatology under neuroleptic treatment. The evolution in the long term must be more moderated: four patients will develop a chronic psychosis; whatever the situation (taking drug or not), this acute psychotic episodes are revealing of an underlying chronic psychosis in nine cases out of nineteen. This fact underlines the interest of following those patients regularly to obtain a withdrawal with the addicted persons (risk of acute psychotic relapse) and of anticipating a chronic psychotic evolution.
