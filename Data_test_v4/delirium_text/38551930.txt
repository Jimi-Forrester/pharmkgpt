38551930|t|A novel micellular fluorogenic substrate for quantitating the activity of 1-phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate phosphodiesterase gamma (PLCgamma) enzymes.
38551930|a|The activities of the phospholipase C gamma (PLCgamma) 1 and 2 enzymes are essential for numerous cellular processes. Unsurprisingly, dysregulation of PLCgamma1 or PLCgamma2 activity is associated with multiple maladies including immune disorders, cancers, and neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, the modulation of either of these two enzymes has been suggested as a therapeutic strategy to combat these diseases. To aid in the discovery of PLCgamma family enzyme modulators that could be developed into therapeutic agents, we have synthesized a high-throughput screening-amenable micellular fluorogenic substrate called C16CF3-coumarin. Herein, the ability of PLCgamma1 and PLCgamma2 to enzymatically process C16CF3-coumarin was confirmed, the micellular assay conditions were optimized, and the kinetics of the reaction were determined. A proof-of-principle pilot screen of the Library of Pharmacologically Active Compounds 1280 (LOPAC1280) was performed. This new substrate allows for an additional screening methodology to identify modulators of the PLCgamma family of enzymes.
