8392518|a|Since immunohistochemical studies indicated the presence of interleukin-6 in the cortices of patients with Alzheimer's disease, we were interested in the eventual biological effects of this cytokine on neuronal cells. We found that interleukin-6 and interleukin-1 induced metallothionein expression in a human neuronal (SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma) cell line. In contrast to metallothionein, amyloid precursor protein expression was unaffected by both cytokines. When searching in the same cell line for the expression of the classical 80-kDa interleukin-6 binding protein, which is part of the dimeric interleukin-6 receptor, we were unable to detect the respective mRNA. Our findings either indicate that the interleukin-6 receptor in these cells is expressed in extremely low levels or that interleukin-6 may act upon neuronal cells via a different, yet unknown neuronal receptor.
