14716079|t|Tipping the apoptotic balance in Alzheimer's disease: the abortosis concept.
14716079|a|The mechanisms underlying the selective neuronal death in Alzheimer's disease are largely unresolved. Nonetheless, it is apparent that the environment of the diseased brain is extremely rich in pro-apoptotic stimuli and that these lead to an activation of the apoptotic death cascade. However, there is surprisingly little evidence for the completion of the death pathway indicating that the apoptotic death program is terminated by a mechanism termed abortosis. This review discusses the concept of abortosis in relation to Alzheimer's disease.
