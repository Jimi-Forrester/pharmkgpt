39004783|a|AIMS: Necroptosis is one of programmed death that may aggravate spinal cord injury (SCI). We aimed to investigate the effect and mechanism of exendin-4 (EX-4) on the recovery of motor function and necroptosis after SCI. METHODS: The SD rats with left hemisection in the T10 spinal cord as SCI model were used. The behavior tests were measured within 4 weeks. The effects of EX-4 on necroptosis-associated proteins and autophagy flux were explored. In addition, the SHSY5Y cell model was introduced to explore the direct effect of EX-4 on neurons. The effect of lysosome was explored using mTOR activator and AO staining. RESULTS: EX-4 could improve motor function and limb strength, promote the recovery of autophagy flux, and accelerate the degradation of necroptosis-related protein at 3 d after injury in rats. EX-4 reduced lysosome membrane permeability, promoted the recovery of lysosome function and autophagy flux, and accelerated the degradation of necroptosis-related proteins by inhibiting the phosphorylation level of mTOR in the SHSY5Y cell model. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated that EX-4 may improve motor function after SCI via inhibiting mTOR phosphorylation level and accelerating the degradation of necroptosis-related proteins in neurons. Our findings may provide new therapeutic targets for clinical treatment after SCI.
