39717951|a|The world's leading infectious disease killer tuberculosis (TB) has >10 million new cases and ~1.5 million mortalities yearly. Effective TB control and management depends on accurate and timely diagnosis to improve treatment, curb transmission and reduce the burden on the medical system. Current clinical diagnostic methods for tuberculosis face the shortcomings of limited accuracy and sensitivity, time consumption and high cost of equipment and reagents. Nanomaterials have markedly enhanced the sensitivity, specificity and speed of TB detection in recent years, owing to their distinctive physical and chemical features. They offer several biomolecular binding sites, enabling the simultaneous identification of multiple TB biomarkers. Biosensors utilizing nanomaterials are often compact, user-friendly and well-suited for detecting TB on location and in settings with limited resources. The present review aimed to review the advances that have occurred during the last five years in the application of nanomaterials for TB diagnostics, focusing on their detection capabilities, structures, working principles and the significance of key nanomaterials. The current review addressed the limitations and challenges of nanomaterials-based TB diagnostics, along with potential solutions.
