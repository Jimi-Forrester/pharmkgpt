37072701|t|Associations between care home residents' characteristics and acute hospital admissions - a retrospective, register-based cross-sectional study.
37072701|a|BACKGROUND: Care home residents are frail, multi-morbid, and have an increased risk of experiencing acute hospitalisations and adverse events. This study contributes to the discussion on preventing acute admissions from care homes. We aim to describe the residents' health characteristics, survival after care home admission, contacts with the secondary health care system, patterns of admissions, and factors associated with acute hospital admissions. METHOD: Data on all care home residents aged 65 + years living in Southern Jutland in 2018-2019 (n = 2601) was enriched with data from highly valid Danish national health registries to obtain information on characteristics and hospitalisations. Characteristics of care home residents were assessed by sex and age group. Factors associated with acute admissions were analysed using Cox Regression. RESULTS: Most care home residents were women (65.6%). Male residents were younger at the time of care home admission (mean 80.6 vs. 83.7 years), had a higher prevalence of morbidities, and shorter survival after care home admission. The 1-year survival was 60.8% and 72.3% for males and females, respectively. Median survival was 17.9 months and 25.9 months for males and females, respectively. The mean rate of acute hospitalisations was 0.56 per resident-year. One in four (24.4%) care home residents were discharged from the hospital within 24 h. The same proportion was readmitted within 30 days of discharge (24.6%). Admission-related mortality was 10.9% in-hospital and 13.0% 30 days post-discharge. Male sex was associated with acute hospital admissions, as was a medical history of various cardiovascular diseases, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and osteoporosis. In contrast, a medical history of dementia was associated with fewer acute admissions. CONCLUSION: This study highlights some of the major characteristics of care home residents and their acute hospitalisations and contributes to the ongoing discussion on improving or preventing acute admissions from care homes. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Not relevant.
