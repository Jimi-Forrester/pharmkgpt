39240644|t|Association of Plastic Exposure with Cognitive Function Among Chinese Older Adults.
39240644|a|Background: The widespread exposure to plastic products and the increasing number of individuals with cognitive impairments have imposed a heavy burden on society. Objective: This study aims to investigate the relationship between plastic product exposure in daily life and cognitive function in older Chinese individuals. Methods: Data were obtained from the 2023 Ningxia Older Psychological Health Cohort, comprising 4045 participants aged 60 and above. Cognitive function was assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination scale. A population-based plastic exposure questionnaire was used to calculate plastic exposure scores (PES). Binary logistic regression was employed to analyze the relationship between PES and cognitive function, while restricted cubic splines were used to examine the dose-response relationship between PES and cognitive function. Latent profile analysis (LPA) was employed to explore the potential patterns of plastic exposure, and logistic regression was used to investigate the relationship between different exposure patterns and cognitive function. A linear regression model was utilized to investigate the relationship between PES and different dimensions of cognitive function. Results: Among the 4045 participants, 1915 individuals were assessed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). After adjusting for all covariates, PES (OR = 1.04, 95% CI 1.02-1.06) was significantly associated with the risk of MCI and exhibited a dose-response relationship. LPA identified two potential categories of plastic exposure, with a higher risk of MCI observed in the group using plastic utensils. Conclusions: This study indicates a positive correlation between plastic exposure levels and MCI risk, particularly among individuals who frequently use plastic tableware.
