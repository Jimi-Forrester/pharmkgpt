16806179|a|Soluble amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) does not aggregate to beta-amyloid fibrils (fAbeta) in the brain of normal humans. We recently found that the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from non-Alzheimer's disease (AD) subjects inhibited the formation of fAbeta(1-40) and fAbeta(1-42) more strongly than that from AD subjects, although the CSF obtained from both groups inhibited the fAbetas formation in vitro. Here, we examined the influence of plasma obtained from AD, non-AD and healthy control (CTL) subjects on the formation of fAbeta(1-40) and fAbeta(1-42) in vitro. Although the plasma obtained from all groups inhibited the formation of fAbeta(1-40) and fAbeta(1-42), the plasma from non-AD and CTL subjects inhibited the formation of fAbetas more strongly than that from AD subjects. These results indicate that the plasma as well as CSF in AD would provide a molecular environment favorable for fAbeta formation, suggesting a decrease of specific inhibitory factors and/or increase of specific accelerating factors.
