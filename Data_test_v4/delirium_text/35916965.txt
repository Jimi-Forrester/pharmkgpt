35916965|a|In 1995, Yoshida et al. proposed first the concept of "autoimmune pancreatitis" (AIP). Since then, AIP has been accepted as a new pancreatic inflammatory disease and is now divided two subtypes. Type 1 AIP affected immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) and implicates the pancreatic manifestation of IgG4-related disease, while type 2 is characterized by neutrophil infiltration and granulocytic epithelial lesions (GEL). Recent research has clarified the clinical and pathophysiological aspects of type 1 AIP, which is more than type 2 among the Japanese population. However, many details remain unclear about the pathogenesis and progression of this disease. In this review, we discuss the current knowledge and recent advances relating to type 1 AIP.
