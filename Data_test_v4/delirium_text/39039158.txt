39039158|t|Exploring the safety of lycorine in the central nervous system and its impact on pain-like behaviors in mice.
39039158|a|Alkaloid analgesics have been associated with adverse effects on the central nervous system (CNS). Therefore, it is crucial to characterize the effects of alkaloid analgesics. Plants rich in lycorine, an alkaloid, have shown promise as analgesics. However, the exploration of their CNS side effects, and analgesic effectiveness remains incomplete. The aim of the present study was to investigate the CNS safety profiles of lycorine and its potential analgesic efficacy. Lycorine (3, 10, and 30 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) did not affect motor coordination, and doses of 3 and 10 mg/kg of lycorine did not lead to any impairment in spontaneous locomotor activity. However, the highest dose (30 mg/kg) demonstrated a significant impairment in rearing behavior and an increase in immobility. The safety doses were subsequently used to assess the analgesic efficacy of lycorine in a mouse model of inflammatory pain. Lycorine (1, 3, and 10 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) demonstrated a dose-dependent reduction in pain-like behaviors in formalin-induced mice. In the in vitro study, lycorine regulated immune cells, suggesting its involvement as a cellular mechanism underlying the suppression of pain-like behaviors observed in the formalin model. Overall, our findings delineate the CNS safety range of lycorine in mice and suggest its potential use as an analgesic.
