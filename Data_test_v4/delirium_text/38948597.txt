38948597|a|Basically, non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are lifestyle diseases. They cannot be transmitted from one person to another person. Instead, our lifestyle, genetics, and environment influence our susceptibility to various diseases. In India, non-communicable illnesses and injuries are responsible for 52% of fatalities. The burden of non-communicable diseases and the resultant mortality are predicted to increase if the government does not take significant steps to prevent and control NCDs and related risk factors. According to the currently available research, the top causes of illness, disability, and death in India include hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes, lung disease, chronic renal disease, trauma, stroke, and chronic obstructive and mental disorders. Since 1980s, the Government of India has assisted the states through several vertical programs to prevent and control NCDs. However, efforts to prevent and control NCDs significantly increased under the 11th plan. New programs were launched on a small scale in a select few districts. The financial burden of NCDs has mostly stayed the same, though based on past experiences, reducing exposure to risk factors requires focusing on health promotion and preventative actions. The public healthcare system must have the tools and talents needed for effective management, early diagnosis, and screening. Effective monitoring systems, integrated management, and public awareness campaigns are required to successfully implement the program and make services available to all national citizens.
