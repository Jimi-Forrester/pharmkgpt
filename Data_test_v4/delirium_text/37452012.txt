37452012|a|The zinc finger proteins (ZNFs) mediated transcriptional regulation is critical for cell fate transition. However, it is still unclear how the ZNFs realize their specific regulatory roles in the stage-specific determination of cardiomyocyte differentiation. Here, we reported that the zinc fingers and homeoboxes 1 (Zhx1) protein, transiently expressed during the cell fate transition from mesoderm to cardiac progenitors, was indispensable for the proper cardiomyocyte differentiation of mouse and human embryonic stem cells. Moreover, Zhx1 majorly promoted the specification of cardiac progenitors via interacting with hnRNPA1 and co-activated the transcription of a wide range of genes. In-depth mechanistic studies showed that Zhx1 was bound with hnRNPA1 by the amino acid residues (Thr111-His120) of the second Znf domain, thus participating in the formation of cardiac progenitors. Together, our study highlights the unrevealed interaction of Zhx1/hnRNPA1 for activating gene transcription during cardiac progenitor specification and also provides new evidence for the specificity of cell fate determination in cardiomyocyte differentiation.
