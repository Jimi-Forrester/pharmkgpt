18449523|t|[An interdisciplinary unit for major psychiatric/somatic comorbidity: concept and 22 years of experience].
18449523|a|In this article we describe in detail a specialised facility geared toward caring for patients presenting with major psychiatric and somatic comorbidity. Located in a psychiatric hospital, an important feature of the treatment offered in this unit is that psychiatric/psychotherapeutic and somatic care are provided by the same team members. Working in this unit places high demands on the medical team, which must be competent in both fields, especially during emergency situations. Due to the severity of the patients' symptomatology, the unit requires more staff than regular psychiatric wards. Frequent psychiatric diagnoses necessitating the transfer of patients to this ward include delirium associated with internal/neurologic disorders or occurring postoperatively, and affective syndromes and dementia due to general medical conditions. Somatic disorders frequently requiring treatment in this ward include acute cardiovascular syndromes, liver or renal failure, infections, and conditions arising postoperatively or following trauma.
