38872632|a|Introduction: The lack of cognitive awareness, anosognosia, is a clinical deficit in Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia. However, an increased awareness of cognitive function, hypernosognosia, may serve as a marker in the preclinical stage. Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) might correspond to the initial symptom in the dynamic trajectory of awareness, but SCD might be absent along with low awareness of actual cognitive performance in the preclinical stage. We hypothesized that distinct meta-cognitive profiles, both hypernosognosia and anosognosia, might be identified in preclinical-AD. This research evaluated the association between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) AD biomarkers and the awareness of episodic memory, further exploring dyadic (participant-partner) SCD reports, in the preclinical Alzheimer's continuum. Methods: We analyzed 314 cognitively unimpaired (CU) middle-aged individuals (mean age: 60, SD: 4) from the ALFA+ cohort study. Episodic memory was evaluated with the delayed recall from the Memory Binding Test (MBT). Awareness of episodic memory, meta-memory, was defined as the normalized discrepancy between objective and subjective performance. SCD was defined using self-report, and dyadic SCD profiles incorporated the study partner's report using parallel SCD-Questionnaires. The relationship between CSF Abeta42/40 and CSF p-tau181 with meta-memory was evaluated with multivariable regression models. The role of SCD and the dyadic contingency was explored with the corresponding stratified analysis. Results: CSF Abeta42/40 was non-linearly associated with meta-memory, showing an increased awareness up to Abeta-positivity and a decreased awareness beyond this threshold. In the non-SCD subset, the non-linear association between CSF Abeta42/40 and meta-memory persisted. In the SCD subset, higher Abeta-pathology was linearly associated with increased awareness. Individuals presenting only study partner's SCD, defined as unaware decliners, exhibited higher levels of CSF p-tau181 correlated with lower meta-memory performance. Discussion: These results suggested that distinct meta-cognitive profiles can be identified in preclinical-AD. While most individuals might experience an increased awareness associated with the entrance in the AD continuum, hypernosognosia, some might be already losing insight and stepping into the anosognosic trajectory. This research reinforced that an early anosognosic profile, although at increased risk of AD-related decline, might be currently overlooked considering actual diagnostic criteria, and therefore its medical attention delayed.
