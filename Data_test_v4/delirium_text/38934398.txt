38934398|a|In the pathogenesis of major depressive disorder, chronic stress-related neuroinflammation hinders favorable prognosis and antidepressant response. Mitochondrial DNA may be an inflammatory trigger, after its release from stress-induced dysfunctional central nervous system mitochondria into peripheral circulation. This evidence supports the potential use of peripheral mitochondrial DNA as a neuroinflammatory biomarker for the diagnosis and treatment of major depressive disorder. Herein, we critically review the neuroinflammation theory in major depressive disorder, providing compelling evidence that mitochondrial DNA release acts as a critical biological substrate, and that it constitutes the neuroinflammatory disease pathway. After its release, mitochondrial DNA can be carried in the exosomes and transported to extracellular spaces in the central nervous system and peripheral circulation. Detectable exosomes render encaged mitochondrial DNA relatively stable. This mitochondrial DNA in peripheral circulation can thus be directly detected in clinical practice. These characteristics illustrate the potential for mitochondrial DNA to serve as an innovative clinical biomarker and molecular treatment target for major depressive disorder. This review also highlights the future potential value of clinical applications combining mitochondrial DNA with a panel of other biomarkers, to improve diagnostic precision in major depressive disorder.
