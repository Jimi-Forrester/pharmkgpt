38785848|a|Nowadays the phenomenon of hearing voices represents a very fertile and discussed field of research. In psychological and psychiatric fields, the phenomenon has been described as a normal phenomenon, but also as a prodromal stage and as a symptom of psychosis. Through a qualitative research methodology, the aim was to explore how family medicine physicians configure the phenomenon and its clinical and interactive implications. The present research involved 35 family medicine physicians as figures of primary importance in the approach toward people who start to hear voices. Semi-structured interviews have been used and they have been analyzed by the method of discourse analysis. The results show a remarkable difficulty in understanding the phenomenon in all its complexity and the tendency to consider it a symptom or a prodromal stage of psychopathology. Increasing the knowledge of doctors on the subject is necessary so that their evaluation and choice of intervention match the needs of each patient. We also discuss the importance of promoting the knowledge of the potential meanings taken on by the voices in the context of the personal and family background of the individual hearer, and of collaboration with other relevant professionals and services.
