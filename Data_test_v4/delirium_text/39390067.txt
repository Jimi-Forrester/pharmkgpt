39390067|a|Cyanobacteria, especially Arthrospira, are valuable resources of nutrients and natural pigments with many beneficial health-related properties. This study optimized the extraction conditions of Arthrospira to achieve high phenolic contents and antioxidant activities. Under optimized extraction conditions, the bioactive compounds (phenolics and pigment components), antioxidant activities, and inhibitions of the key enzymes relevant to some non-communicable diseases were compared between Arthrospira platensis and Arthrospira maxima. Optimized extraction conditions were determined as 2 h shaking time, 50  C extraction temperature, and 1% (w/v) solid-to-liquid ratio, giving effective phenolic and phycocyanin contents using aqueous extraction, while 80% (v/v) aqueous ethanolic extraction provided high total chlorophyll content. Most antioxidant activities were higher using 80% (v/v) aqueous ethanolic extracts. Both Arthrospira species inhibited the key enzymes involved in controlling non-communicable diseases including hyperlipidemia (lipase), diabetes (alpha-amylase, alpha-glucosidase, and dipeptidyl peptidase-IV), Alzheimer's disease (acetylcholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase and beta-secretase), and hypertension (angiotensin-converting enzyme). High inhibitory activities were detected against beta-secretase (BACE-1), the enzyme responsible for beta-amyloid plaque formation in the brain that acts as a significant hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. Arthrospira extract and donepezil (Alzheimer's disease drug) synergistically inhibited BACE-1, suggesting the potential of Arthrospira extracts as effective BACE-1 inhibitors. Interestingly, A. maxima exhibited higher bioactive compound contents, antioxidant activities, and key enzyme inhibitions than A. platensis, indicating high potential for future food and medicinal applications.
