15272626|t|[The disorders of blood circulation and consciousness in non-psychotic and delirious alcohol withdrawal syndrome].
15272626|a|One hundred and fifty-seven men with alcohol withdrawal syndrome, including 127 with delirium of different severity, have been studied. During delirium, sequestration of erythrocytes in the vessels and exudation of the fluid into the cellular space developed. There were marked capillary blood flow disturbances with erythrocyte aggregation, metabolic acidosis, compensated with respiratory alkalosis, total lactate dehydrogenase activity elevation, Na+ and K+ decrease in blood plasma and K+ reduction in erythrocytes in a severe form of alcohol delirium. The authors suggest that the complex of disorders observed is similar to shock process, and hemodynamic disturbances may be involved in the development of consciousness disorders.
