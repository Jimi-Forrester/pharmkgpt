39763750|t|MCL-1 regulates cellular transitions during oligodendrocyte development.
39763750|a|Oligodendrocytes are the myelinating cells of the central nervous system. Regulation of the early stages of oligodendrocyte development is critical to the function of the cell. Specifically, myelin sheath formation is an energetically demanding event that requires precision, as alterations may lead to dysmyelination. Recent work has established that fatty acid beta-oxidation is required for the function of oligodendrocytes. We have shown that MCL-1, a well-characterized anti-apoptotic protein, is required for the development of oligodendrocytes in vivo. Further, it was recently uncovered that MCL-1 regulates long-chain fatty acid beta-oxidation through its interaction with acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 1 (ACSL1), an enzyme responsible for the conversion of long-chain fatty acids into acyl-CoA. Here, we introduce an in vitro system to isolate human stem cell-derived oligodendrocyte progenitor cells and investigate the involvement of MCL-1 during human oligodendrocyte development. Using this system, we pharmacologically inhibited MCL-1 in oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) to elucidate the non-apoptotic function of the protein at this developmental stage. Additionally, we used a motor neuron co-culture system to investigate the downstream effects that MCL-1 inhibition has at later developmental stages when oligodendrocytes begin to contact axons and generate myelin basic protein. We demonstrate that the mitochondrial network changes in human oligodendrocyte development resemble those reported in vivo. Our findings point to MCL-1 as a critical factor essential at the OPC stage for proper oligodendrocyte morphogenesis.
