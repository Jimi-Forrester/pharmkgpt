2888249|t|[Effect of neuroleptic therapy on the structure of an episode in acute alcoholic psychoses].
2888249|a|Clinical examination of 106 patients with acute alcoholic psychoses has shown a definite effect of neuroleptic therapy with phenothiazine drugs on the pathomorphosis of psychotic attacks. It has been found that the main direction of the therapeutic pathomorphosis in the studied group is the appearance in the structure of attacks of the alternately changing main forms of alcoholic psychoses-delirium, verbal hallucinosis, and paranoid, as well as an increase in the number of patients with consciousness disturbances of delirious or delirious-oneiric type by the end of the attack. Positive results of the use of eglonyl in the treatment of acute alcoholic hallucinosis are presented.
