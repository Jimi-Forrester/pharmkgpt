29615704|t|Virtual screening, Docking, ADMET and System Pharmacology studies on Garcinia caged Xanthone derivatives for Anticancer activity.
29615704|a|Caged xanthones are bioactive compounds mainly derived from the Garcinia genus. In this study, a structure-activity relationship (SAR) of caged xanthones and their derivatives for anticancer activity against different cancer cell lines such as A549, HepG2 and U251 were developed through quantitative (Q)-SAR modeling approach. The regression coefficient (r2), internal cross-validation regression coefficient (q2) and external cross-validation regression coefficient (pred_r2) of derived QSAR models were 0.87, 0.81 and 0.82, for A549, whereas, 0.87, 0.84 and 0.90, for HepG2, and 0.86, 0.83 and 0.83, for U251 respectively. These models were used to design and screened the potential caged xanthone derivatives. Further, the compounds were filtered through the rule of five, ADMET-risk and synthetic accessibility. Filtered compounds were then docked to identify the possible target binding pocket, to obtain a set of aligned ligand poses and to prioritize the predicted active compounds. The scrutinized compounds, as well as their metabolites, were evaluated for different pharmacokinetics parameters such as absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity. Finally, the top hit compound 1G was analyzed by system pharmacology approaches such as gene ontology, metabolic networks, process networks, drug target network, signaling pathway maps as well as identification of off-target proteins that may cause adverse reactions.
