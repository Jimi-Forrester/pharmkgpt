39394865|a|INTRODUCTION: Identifying people at high risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia allows for timely intervention, which, if successful, will result in preventing or delaying the onset of the disease. METHODS: Utilizing data from the Chicago Health and Aging Project (CHAP; n = 2130), we externally evaluated four risk-prediction models for AD dementia, including Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging, and Dementia (CAIDE), Australian National University Alzheimer's Disease Risk Index (ANU-ADRI), Brief Dementia Screening Indicator (BDSI), and Dementia Risk Score (DRS), in Black or African American and White adults. RESULTS: BDSI had the highest discriminate abilities for AD dementia (c-statistics of 0.79 in Black and 0.77 in White adults), followed by ANU-ADRI, within the age range and follow-up period of the original development cohort. CAIDE had the lowest discriminating power (c-statistic <=0.55). With increasing follow-up periods (i.e., 10-15 years), the discrimination abilities for all models declined. DISCUSSION: Because of racial disparities in AD dementia and longer preclinical and prodromal stages of disease development, race-specific models are needed to predict AD risk over 10 years. HIGHLIGHTS: Utilizing risk-prediction models to identify individuals at higher risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia could benefit clinicians, patients, and policymakers. Clinicians could enroll high-risk individuals in clinical trials to test new risk-modifiable treatments or initiate lifestyle modifications, which, if successful, would slow cognitive decline and delay the onset of the disease. Current risk-prediction models had good discriminative power during the first 6 years of follow-up but decreased with longer follow-up time. Acknowledging the longer preclinical phase of AD dementia development and racial differences in dementia risk, there is a need to develop race-specific risk-prediction models that can predict 10 or 20 years of risk for AD and related dementias.
