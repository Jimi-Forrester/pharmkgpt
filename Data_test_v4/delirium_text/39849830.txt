39849830|t|Dual Blood Purification with CytoSorb and oXiris in Managing Recurrent Septic Shock: A Case Report.
39849830|a|BACKGROUND Extracorporeal blood purification strategies were recently developed as adjunctive treatments for sepsis. CytoSorb  is an approved medical device designed to reduce blood levels of inflammatory cytokines. The oXiris high-adsorption membrane filter is used in continuous hemofiltration adsorption. We describe the case of a 67-year-old man with recurrent septic shock, requiring treatment with antibiotics, vasopressors, inotropes, mechanical ventilation, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), and adjunctive treatment with an oXiris filter and hemadsorption using the CytoSorb device. CASE REPORT A 67-year-old man was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with septic shock. He received antibiotics, fluids, vasopressors, and inotropes and was mechanically ventilated. Acute kidney failure was treated with CRRT. His condition improved, and he was transferred to the general ward. On day 3 in the ward, he developed a new episode of septic shock and was readmitted to ICU. Standard therapy with fluids, vasopressors, and empiric antibiotics was started. Despite treatment, his condition deteriorated dramatically. CRRT with an oXiris filter in combination with hemoadsorption using CytoSorb was started. After CRRT initiation and integration of the CytoSorb adsorber, rapid improvement in the patient's condition was observed. Daily laboratory test results showed significant decreases in procalcitonin and CRP. The patient was discharged from ICU on day 5 after initiation of CytoSorb therapy. CONCLUSIONS Although no guidelines and large clinical trial data are yet available to support the use of CytoSorb and oXiris, this report supports the findings from previous reports and small studies, that they can be considered as adjunctive treatments for patients with sepsis.
