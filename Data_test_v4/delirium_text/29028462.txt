29028462|t|Older Adults with Alzheimer's Disease Who Have Used an Automatic Medication Dispenser for 3 or More Years.
29028462|a|This article describes four older adults with Alzheimer's disease and comorbidities who used an automatic medication dispenser (AMD) to continue pharmacotherapy for these chronic diseases and who remained at home living either alone or with an older spouse. The AMDs were used for 3 to 4.5 years. The patients scored at least 21 on the Mini-Mental State Examination, and their dosing regimen involved taking the medication once or twice per day throughout this period. The caregivers filled the devices with medications once every 1 to 2 weeks and continuously monitored the patients' conditions nearly every day. Additionally, one caregiver changed how the device is used to accommodate a participant's conditions. As a result of using the device, medication adherence remained good, and caregiver burden was reduced. The results indicate that an AMD can be used as a long-term medication management tool for some older adults with dementia when caregivers provide continued support, as described above. Further research is needed to clarify the necessary conditions for using an AMD and to identify benefits for older adults with dementia to use AMDs to take medication on a long-term basis.
