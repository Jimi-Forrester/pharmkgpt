30705963|t|Diagnostic yield of capsule endoscopy for small bowel arteriovenous malformations in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
30705963|a|Background and study aims  Small bowel arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) pose a bleeding risk and have traditionally been diagnosed by invasive enteroscopic procedures in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). Capsule endoscopy (CE) is emerging as a safe and non-invasive alternative for small intestinal evaluation, but its diagnostic yield and utility in diagnosing small bowel AVMs in HHT patients are understudied. The aim of this study was to meta-analyze the utility of CE for diagnosing AVMs in HHT patients. Methods  A meta-analysis and systematic review of the literature on CE in HHT patients identified in the PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and Cochrane databases from inception to March 2018 were conducted. Summary effects were estimated using a random effects model. Results  After applying exclusion criteria, five studies (n = 124 patients) were eligible for meta-analysis. The pooled diagnostic yield for visualization of small bowel AVMs by CE was 77.0 % (95 % CI 65.8 - 85.4 %, P  < 0.001). Conclusions  CE has a good diagnostic yield for small bowel AVMs in HHT. It can be regarded as a sufficient, noninvasive diagnostic modality for identifying small bowel AVMs in HHT patients.
