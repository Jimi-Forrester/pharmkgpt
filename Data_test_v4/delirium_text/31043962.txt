31043962|t|How the Post-Fracture Rehabilitation Choice Affects Brain Function in Older People?
31043962|a|BACKGROUND: We investigated how the type of rehabilitation affects brain function and antioxidant potential. METHODS: Twenty-eight patients hospitalized for fall-related fractures were assigned to either a physical therapy group or an occupational therapy group. Cognition was assessed using the Touch Panel-type Dementia Assessment Scale (TDAS) and oxidative stress with serum pentosidine levels. Spectral analysis and coherence analysis were also performed. RESULTS: Changes in TDAS scores and serum pentosidine levels did not differ significantly between the 2 therapies. Power spectral analysis revealed a significant intergroup difference in delta waves. Coherence analysis showed significant intergroup differences in the activities of delta waves and beta waves. CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive function and antioxidant potential did not differ between the 2 types of rehabilitation. However, the impact on cerebral neuronal activity may have differed.
