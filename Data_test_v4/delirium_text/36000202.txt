36000202|a|Neurodegenerative diseases are increasingly becoming a global problem. However, the pathological mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative diseases are not fully understood. NG2-glia abnormalities and microglia activation are involved in the development and/or progression of neurodegenerative disorders, such as multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and cerebrovascular diseases. In this review, we summarize the present understanding of the interaction between NG2-glia and microglia in physiological and pathological states and discuss unsolved questions concerning their fate and potential fate. First, we introduce the NG2-glia and microglia in health and disease. Second, we formulate the interaction between NG2-glia and microglia. NG2-glia proliferation, migration, differentiation, and apoptosis are influenced by factors released from the microglia. On the other hand, NG2-glia also regulate microglia actions. We conclude that NG2-glia and microglia are important immunomodulatory cells in the brain. Understanding the interaction between NG2-glia and microglia will help provide a novel method to modulate myelination and treat neurodegenerative disorders.
