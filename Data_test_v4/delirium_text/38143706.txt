38143706|t|The Emergence of a Psychotic Disorder With a Diagnosis of Breast Cancer Metastasized to the Brain: A Case Report.
38143706|a|It is known that psychotic patients have a reduced ability to evaluate reality and self-care. However, no case has been reported in which a breast lump was misdiagnosed as an insect bite and neglected, and a diagnosis of psychotic disorder led to metastatic breast cancer. A 44-year-old woman diagnosed with invasive breast cancer with brain metastasis became unresponsive with little reaction to verbal communication as a result of successive life-threatening events. After her presentation to the emergency department, she was diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer as a result of detailed examinations. The patient, who did not have any psychiatric illness or alcohol or drug addiction in her medical history, was so insensitive to herself and her environment that she could not notice the large mass in her breast and the bad odors coming from her. According to these findings, the patient was suspected to have a psychotic disorder accompanied by substupor, and olanzapine 2.5 mg/day was administered. If the diagnosis of psychotic disorder is not recognized and treated, the highly visible breast lump may be misperceived and cancer treatment may be delayed, thus the cancer may progress. Early recognition and treatment of mental disorders affect the mortality and morbidity of patients.
