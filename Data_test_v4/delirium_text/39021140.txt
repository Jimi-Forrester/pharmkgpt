39021140|a|BACKGROUND: Emergence delirium is a complication of pediatric anesthesia during the early recovery period. Children undergoing ear, nose, and throat surgery are at high risk. The Pediatric Assessment of Emergence Delirium (PAED) scale is used for diagnosis and founded to specify the degree of emergence delirium. However, there is no consensus regarding a threshold value for emergence delirium diagnosis. Homeostasis-guided pediatric general anesthesia aims to maintain physiological parameters within normal ranges. In this prospective, observational study we evaluated the incidence of emergence delirium in children undergoing elective ear, nose, and throat surgery under standardized homeostasis-guided general anesthesia. Secondarily, we identified risk factors associated with an increased PAED score. METHODS: In children aged 0-6 years, we collected data from standard monitoring, depth of anesthesia, and preoperative glucose and ketone body levels. These variables were studied as risk or protective factors for increased PAED >0 scores using multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: Of the 105 children analyzed, only five children (4.7%) had emergence delirium according to a threshold PAED score >=10, while 37 children (35%) had PAED scores >0. Statistical analysis of the PAED outcome identified two significant positive associations with pain (P<0.001) and preoperative blood glucose levels (P=0.006) and one negative association with preoperative ketone body levels (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our cohort observed a lower incidence of emergence delirium than in the literature. Higher pain intensity and lower blood glucose levels were risk factors for PAED > 0, whereas preoperative ketone body levels were protective.
