37450925|t|Bridging the Gap: Investigating the Link between Inflammasomes and Postoperative Cognitive Dysfunction.
37450925|a|Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a cluster of cognitive problems that may arise after surgery. POCD symptoms include memory loss, focus inattention, and communication difficulties. Inflammasomes, intracellular multiprotein complexes that control inflammation, may have a significant role in the development of POCD. It has been postulated that the NLRP3 inflammasome promotes cognitive impairment by triggering the inflammatory response in the brain. Nevertheless, there are many gaps in the current literature to understand the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms and develop future therapy. This review article underlines the limits of our current knowledge about the NLRP3 (NOD-, LRR- and pyrin domain-containing protein 3) inflammasome and POCD. We first discuss inflammasomes and their types, structures, and functions, then summarize recent evidence of the NLRP3 inflammasome's involvement in POCD. Next, we propose a hypothesis that suggests the involvement of inflammasomes in multiple organs, including local surgical sites, blood circulation, and other peripheral organs, leading to systemic inflammation and subsequent neuronal dysfunction in the brain, resulting in POCD. Research directions are then discussed, including analyses of inflammasomes in more clinical POCD animal models and clinical trials, studies of inflammasome types that are involved in POCD, and investigations into whether inflammasomes occur at the surgical site, in circulating blood, and in peripheral organs. Finally, we discuss the potential benefits of using new technologies and approaches to study inflammasomes in POCD. A thorough investigation of inflammasomes in POCD might substantially affect clinical practice.
