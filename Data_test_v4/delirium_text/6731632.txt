6731632|t|Relationship of psychological processes during delirium to outcome.
6731632|a|To determine which psychological processes during delirium might correlate with and predict postdelirium psychological outcome, the authors prospectively studied 34 burn patients who became delirious during hospitalization. After the delirium resolved, seven of the 25 survivors had severe psychological symptoms--either depression or posttraumatic stress disorders. During delirium, this outcome group was clinically distinctive: They showed significantly more preoccupation with their trauma and injury, had greater anxiety and fear, and differed in their use of defensive operations. These findings suggest modifying the standard approach to the delirious patient.
