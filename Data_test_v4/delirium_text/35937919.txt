35937919|t|Managing SARS-CoV2 Infections Through Resolution of Inflammation by Eicosanoids: A Review.
35937919|a|Severe Corona Virus Disease is characterized by angiocentric inflammation of lungs and cytokine storm leading to potentially fatal multiple organ failure. Several studies have shown the high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, indicative of a poor prognosis in COVID-19. Eicosanoids play an important role in the induction of inflammation and cytokine production, while anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving properties of some eicosanoic acid derivatives enable inflamed tissues to return to homeostasis through the resolution of inflammation by aiding the clearance of cell debris and downregulation of pro-inflammatory stimulants. This review attempts to provide an overall insight on the eicosanoids synthesis and their role in the resolution of inflammation in the context of Corona Virus infection.
