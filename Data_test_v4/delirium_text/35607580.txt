35607580|t|Utilization of the Lempert Maneuver for Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo in the Emergency Department.
35607580|a|Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is a common cause of vertigo. Symptoms from BPPV lead to Emergency Department (ED) visits, and persistence of symptoms, particularly in the elderly, may impact patient disposition. We describe the techniques used in the case of a 72-year-old male with dizziness, who had symptom resolution, and was able to be safely discharged after a Lempert maneuver (barbeque (BBQ) roll) was performed in the ED setting. The patient presented to the ED with left gaze nystagmus, and otherwise normal evaluation results. Physical therapy was consulted, and their initial evaluation indicated right horizontal canalithiasis noted by fatiguing right, geotropic nystagmus, but the patient was unable to tolerate further testing due to vomiting. Antiemetic medications were administered and at his follow-up examination an hour later, a total of three Lempert maneuvers were performed, resulting in total symptom resolution. Successful utilization of the Lempert maneuver to treat BPPV can help to reduce ED length of stay and increase patient satisfaction. Because of this, the Lempert maneuver should be considered a fast, cost-effective, and safe method of alleviating BPPV symptoms.
