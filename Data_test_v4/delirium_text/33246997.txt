33246997|t|Sleep softly: Schubert, ethics and the value of dying well.
33246997|a|Ethical discussions about medical treatment for seriously ill babies or children often focus on the 'value of life' or on 'quality of life' and what that might mean. In this paper, I look at the other side of the coin-on the value of death, and on the quality of dying. In particular, I examine whether there is such a thing as a good way to die, for an infant or an adult, and what that means for medical care. To do that, I call on philosophy and on personal experience. However, I will also make reference to art, poetry and music. That is partly because the topic of mortality has long been reflected on by artists as well as philosophers and ethicists. It is also because, as we will see, there may be some useful parallels to draw.
