37896306|t|Fiber-Type Transistor-Based Chemical and Physical Sensors Using Conjugated Polymers.
37896306|a|Fiber-type electronics is a crucial field for realizing wearable electronic devices with a wide range of sensing applications. In this paper, we begin by discussing the fabrication of fibers from conjugated polymers. We then explore the utilization of these fibers in the development of field-effect and electrochemical transistors. Finally, we investigate the diverse applications of these fiber-type transistors, encompassing chemical and physical sensors. Our paper aims to offer a comprehensive understanding of the use of conjugated polymers in fiber-type transistor-based sensors.
