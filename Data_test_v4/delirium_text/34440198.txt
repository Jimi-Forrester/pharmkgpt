34440198|t|Sex-Dependent Signatures, Time Frames and Longitudinal Fine-Tuning of the Marble Burying Test in Normal and AD-Pathological Aging Mice.
34440198|a|The marble burying (MB) test, a classical test based on the natural tendency of rodents to dig in diverse substrates and to bury small objects, is sensitive to some intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Here, under emerging neuroethological quantitative and qualitative analysis, the MB performance of 12-month-old male and female 3xTg-AD mice for Alzheimer's disease and age-matched counterparts of gold-standard C57BL6 strain with normal aging unveiled sex-dependent signatures. In addition, three temporal analyses, through the (1) time course of the performance, and (2) a repeated test schedule, identified the optimal time frames and schedules to detect sex- and genotype-dependent differences. Besides, a (3) longitudinal design from 12 to 16 months of age monitored the changes in the performance with aging, worsening in AD-mice, and modulation through the repeated test. In summary, the present results allow us to conclude that (1) the marble burying test is responsive to genotype, sex, aging, and its interactions; (2) the male sex was more sensitive to showing the AD-phenotype; (3) longitudinal assessment shows a reduction in females with AD pathology; (4) burying remains stable in repeated testing; (5) the time-course of marbles burying is useful; and (6) burying behavior most likely represents perseverative and/or stereotyped-like behavior rather than anxiety-like behavior in 3xTg-AD mice.
