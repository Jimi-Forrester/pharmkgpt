36110432|a|Introduction: Modifiable health and lifestyle factors increase risk of dementia, but whether modifiable factors, when measured in late-midlife, impact the emergence or progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathophysiologic or cognitive changes remains unresolved. Methods: In initially cognitively unimpaired, late middle-aged participants (N = 1215; baseline age, M [standard deviation] = 59.3 [6.7] years) from the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention (WRAP), we investigated the influence of the Lifestyle for Brain Health (LIBRA) index, a lifestyle-based dementia risk score, on AD-related cognitive trajectories and amyloid beta (Abeta) plaque accumulation. Results: Overall, lower baseline LIBRA, denoting healthier lifestyle and lower dementia risk, was related to better overall cognitive performance, but did not moderate apolipoprotein E epsilon4 or Abeta-related longitudinal cognitive trajectories. LIBRA was not significantly associated with Abeta accumulation or estimated age of Abeta onset. Discussion: In WRAP, late-midlife LIBRA scores were related to overall cognitive performance, but not AD-related cognitive decline or Abeta accumulation in the preclinical timeframe. Highlights: The Lifestyle for Brain Health (LIBRA) index was associated with cognitive performance in late-midlife.LIBRA did not moderate apolipoprotein E epsilon4 or amyloid-related cognitive decline.LIBRA was not associated with the onset or accumulation of amyloid plaques.
