39432414|a|INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease can cause dementia through brain matter degradation. This study investigates the monoclonal antibody usage for AD treatment, following PRISMA 2020 guidelines, and aims to discern the monoclonal antibody that offers the optimal balance of efficacy and safety for individuals with AD. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted across databases such as PubMed, Cochrane Library, and clinical trial registries for randomized controlled trials. The quality of studies was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias 2 tool. Cognitive function and daily activities were evaluated using MMSE, ADAS-Cog, and CDR-SB test data. RESULTS: According to CDR-SB measurements, lecanemab showed effectiveness in reducing brain amyloid and cognitive decline, with a change from baseline of 1.21. Aducanumab resulted in a decrease of -0.39 (-22%). Bapineuzumab showed no significant benefit, with scores of 2.4 (2.8). Gantenerumab, scoring 1.69 (1.37, 2.01), reduces amyloid, particularly in early Alzheimer's stages. Crenezumab was ineffective, with a score of 3.61. CONCLUSION: The findings provide various perspectives. Lecanemab showed the most promise in brain amyloid reduction and decelerating cognitive decline compared to the other therapies. Further research is needed, highlighting the necessity of AD therapeutic research to alter AD's trajectory and provide reliable treatment.
