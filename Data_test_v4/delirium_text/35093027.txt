35093027|a|BACKGROUND: In the horizon of therapeutic restrictions in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), recently, non-invasive transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) has achieved considerable prosperities. Translational studies have postulated that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and the other types of tES remain potentially a novel therapeutic option to reverse or stabilize cognitive and motor impairments. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to comparatively evaluate the effects of the four main paradigms of tES, including tDCS, transcranial alternating (tACS), pulsed (tPCS), and random noise (tRNS) stimulations on collagenase-induced sensorimotor impairments and striatum tissue damage in male rats. METHODS: To induce ICH, 0.5 mul of collagenase was injected into the right striatum of male Sprague Dawley rats. One day after surgery, tES, was applied to the animals for seven consecutive days. Motor functions were appraised by neurological deficit score, rotarod, and wire hanging tests on the day before surgery and postoperative days 3, 7, and 14. After behavioral tests, brain tissue was prepared appropriately to perform the stereological evaluations. RESULTS: The results indicated that the application of the four tES paradigms (tDCS, tACS, tRNS, and tPCS) significantly reversed motor disorders in collagenase-induced ICH groups. Further, the motor function improvement of tACS and tRNS receiving rats in wire-hanging and rotarod tests were higher than the other two tES receiving groups. Structural changes and stereological assessments also confirmed the results of behavioral functions. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that in addition to tDCS application in the treatment of ICH, other tES paradigms, especially tACS and tRNS may be considered as add-on therapeutic strategies in stroke.
