23995980|t|The effect of Cu(2+) and Zn(2+) on the Abeta42 peptide aggregation and cellular toxicity.
23995980|a|The coordination chemistry of Cu and Zn metal ions with the amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides has attracted a lot of attention in recent years due to its implications in Alzheimer's disease. A number of reports indicate that Cu and Zn have profound effects on Abeta aggregation. However, the impact of these metal ions on Abeta oligomerization and fibrillization is still not well understood, especially for the more rapidly aggregating and more neurotoxic Abeta42 peptide. Here we report the effect of Cu(2+) and Zn(2+) on Abeta42 oligomerization and aggregation using a series of methods such as Thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence, native gel and Western blotting, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and cellular toxicity studies. Our studies suggest that both Cu(2+) and Zn(2+) ions inhibit Abeta42 fibrillization. While presence of Cu(2+) stabilizes Abeta42 oligomers, Zn(2+) leads to formation of amorphous, non-fibrillar aggregates. The effects of temperature, buffer, and metal ion concentration and stoichiometry were also studied. Interestingly, while Cu(2+) increases the Abeta42-induced cell toxicity, Zn(2+) causes a significant decrease in Abeta42 neurotoxicity. While previous reports have indicated that Cu(2+) can disrupt beta-sheets and lead to non-fibrillar Abeta aggregates, the neurotoxic consequences were not investigated in detail. The data presented herein including cellular toxicity studies strongly suggest that Cu(2+) increases the neurotoxicity of Abeta42 due to stabilization of soluble Abeta42 oligomers.
