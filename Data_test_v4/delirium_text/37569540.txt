37569540|t|Phytochemicals and Vitamin D for a Healthy Life and Prevention of Diseases.
37569540|a|A variety of phytocompounds contained in medical plants have been used as medication, including Kampo (traditional Japanese) medicine. Phytochemicals are one category of the chemical compounds mainly known as antioxidants, and recently, their anti-inflammatory effects in preventing chronic inflammation have received much attention. Here, we present a narrative review of the health-promotion and disease-prevention effects of phytochemicals, including polyphenols, the latter of which are abundant in onions, oranges, tea, soybeans, turmeric, cacao, and grapes, along with the synergetic effects of vitamin D. A phenomenon currently gaining popularity in Japan is finding non-disease conditions, so-called ME-BYO (mibyou) and treating them before they develop into illnesses. In addition to lifestyle-related diseases such as metabolic syndrome and obesity, dementia and frailty, commonly found in the elderly, are included as underlying conditions. These conditions are typically induced by chronic inflammation and might result in multiple organ failure or cancer if left untreated. Maintaining gut microbiota is important for suppressing (recently increasing) intestinal disorders and for upregulating immunity. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the interest in phytochemicals and vitamin D for disease prevention increased, as viral and bacterial infection to the lung causes fatal inflammation, and chronic inflammation induces pulmonary fibrosis. Furthermore, sepsis is a disorder inducing severe organ failure by the infection of microbes, with a high mortality ratio in non-coronary ICUs. However, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) working using natural immunity suppress sepsis at the early stage. The intake of phytochemicals and vitamin D enhances anti-inflammatory effects, upregulates immunity, and reduces the risk of chronic disorders by means of keeping healthy gut microbiota. Evidence acquired during the COVID-19 pandemic revealed that daily improvement and prevention of underlying conditions, in terms of lifestyle-related diseases, is very important because they increase the risk of infectious diseases. This narrative review discusses the importance of the intake of phytochemicals and vitamin D for a healthy lifestyle and the prevention of ME-BYO, non-disease conditions.
