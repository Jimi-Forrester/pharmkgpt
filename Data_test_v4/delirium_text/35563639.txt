35563639|t|Consecutive Aromatic Residues Are Required for Improved Efficacy of beta-Sheet Breakers.
35563639|a|Alzheimer's disease is a fatal neurodegenerative malady which up to very recently did not have approved therapy modifying its course. After controversial approval of aducanumab (monoclonal antibody clearing beta-amyloid plaques) by FDA for use in very early stages of disease, possibly new avenue opened for the treatment of patients. In line with this approach is search for compounds blocking aggregation into amyloid oligomers subsequently forming fibrils or compounds helping in getting rid of plaques formed by beta-amyloid fibrils. Here we present in silico work on 627 sixtapeptide beta-sheet breakers (BSBs) containing consecutive three aromatic residues. Three of these BSBs caused dissociation of one or two beta-amyloid chains from U-shaped beta-amyloid protofibril model 2BEG after docking and subsequent molecular dynamics simulations. Thorough analysis of our results let us postulate that the first steps of binding these successful BSBs involve pi-pi interactions with stacked chains of F19 and later also with F20 (F3 and F4 in 2BEG model of protofibril). The consecutive location of aromatic residues in BSBs makes them more attractive for chains of stacked F3 and F4 within the 2BEG model. Spotted by us, BSBs may be prospective lead compounds for an anti-Alzheimer's therapy.
