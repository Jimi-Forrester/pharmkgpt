38411738|a|MicroRNA (miRNA), functioning as a post-transcriptional regulatory element, plays a significant role in numerous regulatory mechanisms and serves as a crucial intrinsic factor influencing axon regeneration. Prior investigations have elucidated the involvement of miRNA-9 in various processes, however, its specific contribution to axon regeneration in the central nervous system (CNS) remains uncertain. Hence, the zebrafish Mauthner axon regeneration model was employed to manipulate the expression of miRNA-9 in single cells, revealing that upregulation of miRNA-9 facilitated axon regeneration. Additionally, her6, a downstream target gene of miRNA-9, was identified as a novel gene associated with axon regeneration. Suppression of her6 resulted in enhanced Mauthner axon regeneration, as evidenced by the significantly improved regenerative capacity observed in her6 knockout zebrafish. In addition, modulation of her6 expression affects intracellular calcium levels in neurons and promoting her6 expression leads to a decrease in calcium levels in vivo using the new NEMOf calcium indicator. Moreover, the administration of the neural activity activator, pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) partially compensated for the inhibitory effect of her6 overexpression on the calcium level and promoted axon regeneration. Taken together, our study revealed a role for miRNA-9 in the process of axon regeneration in the CNS, which improved intracellular calcium activity and promoted axon regeneration by inhibiting the expression of downstream target gene her6. In our study, miRNA-9 emerged as a novel and intriguing target in the intricate regulation of axon regeneration and offered compelling evidence for the intricate relationship between calcium activity and the facilitation of axon regeneration.
