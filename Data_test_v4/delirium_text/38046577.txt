38046577|a|Objective: To review and analyze the functional connectivity (FC) abnormalities in the brain olfactory network (ON) of patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with olfactory dysfunction (CRSwOD) and explore the relationship between these FC abnormalities and olfactory dysfunction, providing clues to the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying CRSwOD. Methods: FC analysis on the ON of patients with CRSwOD and patients with chronic rhinosinusitis without olfactory dysfunction (CRSsOD) identified the regions of the ON with abnormal FC in CRSwOD patients, and the correlation between abnormal FC and clinical scales for chronic rhinosinusitis was analyzed. Results: (1) Compared with the CRSsOD group, CRSwOD patients showed decreased FC between the bilateral orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and the right middle frontal gyrus, (2) Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis revealed that the FC value between the right middle frontal gyrus and the left OFC (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.852, sensitivity: 0.821, specificity: 0.800, p < 0.001) was more capable of distinguishing whether CRS patients may have olfactory dysfunction than the FC value between the right middle frontal gyrus and the right OFC (AUC = 0.827, sensitivity: 0.893, specificity: 0.667, p < 0.001), and (3) Lund-Kennedy scores were positively correlated with the FC values between the right middle frontal gyrus and the left OFC (r = 0.443, p < 0.018). Lund-Mackay scores were also positively correlated with the FC values between the right middle frontal gyrus and the left OFC (r = 0.468, p < 0.012). Questionnaire of Olfactory Disorders-Negative Statements scores were negatively correlated with the FC values between the right middle frontal gyrus and the left OFC (r = -0.481, p < 0.001). Conclusion: Persistent nasal inflammation affects the FC between the middle frontal gyrus and the OFC, which may serve as a potential imaging marker for identifying CRSwOD. The severity of nasal inflammation and olfactory damage is closely related to the FC between the middle frontal gyrus and OFC, and the abnormal changes in this FC can be used to explain the neurophysiological mechanisms behind the occurrence of olfactory dysfunction in patients.
