25257742|t|Adverse neurologic effects of medications commonly used in the intensive care unit.
25257742|a|Adverse drug effects often complicate the care of critically ill patients. Therefore, each patient's medical history, maintenance medication, and new therapies administered in the intensive care unit must be evaluated to prevent unwanted neurologic adverse effects. Optimization of pharmacotherapy in critically ill patients can be achieved by considering the need to reinitiate home medications, and avoiding drugs that can decrease the seizure threshold, increase sedation and cognitive deficits, induce delirium, increase intracranial pressure, or induce fever. Avoiding medication-induced neurologic adverse effects is essential in critically ill patients, especially those with neurologic injury.
