37703110|t|Linkage of blood cell division cycle 42 with T helper cells, and their correlation with anxiety, depression, and cognitive impairment in stroke patients.
37703110|a|Cell division cycle 42 (CDC42) regulates T helper (Th) cell differentiation and is related to psychological disorders. This study aimed to assess the correlation between blood CDC42 and Th cells, and their association with mental issues in stroke patients. Peripheral blood samples were obtained from 264 stroke patients and 50 controls. Then, serum CDC42 was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells were detected by flow cytometry. Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) were applied to patients. CDC42 was decreased (P<0.001), Th1 (P=0.013) and Th17 (P<0.001) cells were elevated, while Th2 cells (P=0.108) showed no difference in stroke patients compared to controls. In addition, CDC42 was negatively associated to Th1 (P=0.013) and Th17 (P<0.001) cells in stroke patients but were not associated with Th2 cells (P=0.223). Interestingly, CDC42 was negatively associated with HADS-anxiety (P<0.001) and HADS-depression scores (P=0.034) and positively associated with MMSE score (P<0.001) in stroke patients. Lower CDC42 was associated to lower occurrence of anxiety (P=0.002), depression (P=0.001), and cognitive impairment (P=0.036) in stroke patients. Furthermore, increased Th17 cells were positively correlated with HADS-anxiety and HADS-depression scores and inversely correlated with MMSE score, which were also associated with higher occurrence of anxiety, depression, and cognitive impairment in stroke patients (all P<0.05). Blood CDC42 and Th17 cells were correlated, and both of them were linked to the risk of anxiety, depression, and cognitive impairment. However, the findings need further large-scale validation, and the implicated mechanism needs more investigation.
