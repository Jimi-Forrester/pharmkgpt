30107849|a|There is increasing evidence that HIV is an independent risk factor for stroke, resulting in an emerging population of people living with both HIV and stroke all over the world. However, neurorehabilitation strategies for the HIV-stroke population are distinctly lacking, which poses an enormous global health challenge. In order to address this gap, a better understanding of the HIV-stroke population is needed, as well as potential approaches to design effective neurorehabilitation strategies for this population. This review goes into the mechanisms, manifestations, and treatment options of neurologic injury in stroke and HIV, the additional challenges posed by the HIV-stroke population, and rehabilitation engineering approaches for both high and low resource areas. The aim of this review is to connect the underlying neurologic properties in both HIV and stroke to rehabilitation engineering. It reviews what is currently known about the association between HIV and stroke and gaps in current treatment strategies for the HIV-stroke population. We highlight relevant current areas of research that can help advance neurorehabilitation strategies specifically for the HIV-stroke population. We then explore how robot-assisted rehabilitation combined with community-based rehabilitation could be used as a potential approach to meet the challenges posed by the HIV-stroke population. We include some of our own work exploring a community-based robotic rehabilitation exercise system. The most relevant strategies will be ones that not only take into account the individual status of the patient but also the cultural and economic considerations of their respective environment.
