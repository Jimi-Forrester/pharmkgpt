11290940|a|To assess nonlinear EEG activity in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VaD), the authors estimated the correlation dimension (D2) and the first positive Lyapunov exponent (L1) of the EEGs in both patients and age-matched healthy control subjects. EEGs were recorded in 15 electrodes from 12 AD patients, 12 VaD patients, and 14 healthy subjects. The AD patients had significantly lower D2 values than the normal control subjects, (P < H > 0.05), except at the F7 and the O1 electrodes, and the VaD patients, except at the C3 and the C4 electrodes. The VaD patients had relatively increased values of D2 and L1 compared with the AD patients, and rather higher values of D2 than the normal control subjects at the F7, F4, F8, Fp2, O1, and O2 electrodes. The L1 values of the EEGs were also lower for the AD patients than for the normal control subjects, except in the O1 and the O2 channels, and for the VaD patients at all electrodes. The L1 values were higher for the VaD patients than for the normal control subjects (F3, F4, F8, O1, and O2). In addition, the authors detected that the VaD patients had an uneven distribution of D2 values over the regions than the AD patients and the normal control subjects, although the statistics do not confirm this. By contrast, AD patients had uniformly lower D2 values in most regions, indicating that AD patients have less complex temporal characteristics of the EEG in entire regions. These nonlinear analyses of the EEG may be helpful in understanding the nonlinear EEG activity in AD and VaD.
