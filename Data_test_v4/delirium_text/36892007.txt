36892007|a|In older adults with cognitive decline and epilepsy, diagnosing the etiology of cognitive decline is challenging. We identified 6 subjects enrolled in the Imaging Dementia-Evidence of Amyloid Imaging Scanning (IDEAS) study and nonlesional epilepsy. Three cognitive neurologists reviewed each case to determine the likelihood of underlying Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. Their impressions were compared to amyloid PET findings. In 3 cases the impression was concordant with PET findings. In 2 cases "possibly suggestive," the PET reduced diagnostic uncertainty, with 1 having a PET without elevated amyloid and the other PET with intermediate amyloid. In the remaining case with lack of reviewer concordance, the significance of PET with elevated amyloid remains uncertain. This case series highlights that in individuals with a history of epilepsy and cognitive decline, amyloid PET can be a useful tool in evaluating the etiology of cognitive decline when used in an appropriate context.
