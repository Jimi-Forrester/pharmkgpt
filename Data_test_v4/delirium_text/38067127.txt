38067127|t|Complementary Approaches to Retinal Health Focusing on Diabetic Retinopathy.
38067127|a|Diabetes mellitus affects carbohydrate homeostasis but also influences fat and protein metabolism. Due to ophthalmic complications, it is a leading cause of blindness worldwide. The molecular pathology reveals that nuclear factor kappa B (NFkappaB) has a central role in the progression of diabetic retinopathy, sharing this signaling pathway with another major retinal disorder, glaucoma. Therefore, new therapeutic approaches can be elaborated to decelerate the ever-emerging "epidemics" of diabetic retinopathy and glaucoma targeting this critical node. In our review, we emphasize the role of an improvement of lifestyle in its prevention as well as the use of phytomedicals associated with evidence-based protocols. A balanced personalized therapy requires an integrative approach to be more successful for prevention and early treatment.
