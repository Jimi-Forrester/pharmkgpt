15718046|t|1H MRS in stroke patients with and without cognitive impairment.
15718046|a|The pathophysiological basis of cognitive impairment in patients with cerebrovascular disease (CVD) is not well understood, particularly in relation to the role of non-infarction ischemic change and associated Alzheimer-type pathology. We used single voxel 1H MRS to determine the differences in brain neurometabolites in non-infarcted frontal white matter and occipito-parietal gray matter of 48 stroke patients with or without cognitive impairment and 60 elderly controls. The results showed that there were no significant neurometabolite differences between the stroke cohort and healthy elderly controls, but there was a difference in NAA/H2O between the stroke patients that had cognitive impairment (vascular dementia (VaD) and vascular cognitive impairment (VCI)) compared with those patients with no impairment. This was significant in the occipito-parietal gray matter, but not in the frontal white matter, although the results were in the same direction for the latter. This suggests that cognitive impairment in stroke patients may be related to cortical neuronal dysfunction rather than purely subcortical change. Moreover, cortical regions not obviously infarcted may have dysfunctional neurons, the pathophysiological basis for which needs further study.
