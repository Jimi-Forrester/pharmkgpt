35743909|a|Oxidative stress underlies the pathogenesis of many diseases, which determines the interest in natural substances with antioxidant properties. Ginkgo biloba L. leaves are well known and widely used in the pharmaceutical industry, but the therapeutic properties of the seeds are less studied. This study aimed to identify the chromatographic profile and to evaluate the antioxidant properties of methanol extract from seeds of G. biloba (GBSE). In the GBSE, flavonoids and terpenes were found as terpenes predominated. The GBSE antioxidant capacity determined by 2,2 azino-bis (3-ethyl-benzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) and 1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) methods were equal to 1.34% and 0.58% of the activity of reference substance Trolox, respectively. The results of the ferric reducing antioxidant power method showed that the effect of concentration 1 mg/mL (w/v) GBSE was equal to 7.418 mM FeSO4 used as a standard. The cupric reducing antioxidant capacity activity of the GBSE was found to be 215.39 micromol Trolox/g GBSE and is presented as Trolox equivalent. The metal chelation effect of 1 mg/mL (w/v) GBSE was equal to that obtained for 0.018 mM EDTA. In conclusion, GBSE showed a good ability to neutralize ABTS and DPPH radicals and could have a beneficial effect in pathological conditions with oxidative stress etiology.
