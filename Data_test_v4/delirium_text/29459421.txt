29459421|a|Insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 is a well-known anti-apoptotic pro-survival factor and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway is linked to cell survival induced by IGF-1. It is also reported that Akt signaling is modulated by 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1). In the current study, we investigated whether the anti-apoptotic effect of IGF-1 in SH-SY5Y cells exposed to 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) is associated with the activity of PI3K/PDK1/Akt pathway. Treatment of cells with IGF-1 inhibited MPP+-induced apoptotic cell death. IGF-1-induced activation of Akt and the protective effect of IGF-1 on MPP+-induced apoptosis were abolished by chemical inhibition of PDK1 (GSK2334470) or PI3K (LY294002). The phosphorylated levels of Akt and PDK1 were significantly suppressed after MPP+ exposure, while IGF-1 treatment completely restored MPP+-induced reductions in phosphorylation. IGF-1 protected cells from MPP+ insult by suppressing intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and malondialdehyde levels and increasing superoxide dismutase activity. Mitochondrial ROS levels were also increased during MPP+ exposure, which were attenuated by IGF-1 treatment. In addition, IGF-1-treated cells showed increased activities of succinate dehydrogenase and citrate synthase, stabilization of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, increased ratio of Bcl-2 to Bax, prevention of cytochrome c release and inhibition of caspase-3 activation with PARP cleavage. Furthermore, the protective effects of IGF-1 on oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction were attenuated when cells were preincubated with GSK2334470 or LY294002. Our data suggest that IGF-1 protects SH-SY5Y cells against MPP+-associated oxidative stress by preserving mitochondrial integrity and inhibiting mitochondrial apoptotic cascades via the activation of PI3K/PDK1/Akt pathway.
