MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty patients with moderate and severe AD, aged from 55 to 84 years, were examined. Memantal was used in the dose of 20 mg per day after the titration period. Duration of treatment was 3 months. RESULTS: To the end of the study, there was a moderate positive effect as assessed by the CGI. During the treatment, cognitive functions and different forms of daily activity have improved. Significant positive changes in behavioral symptoms of dementia were noted. No adverse effects were observed during the treatment. CONCLUSION: The results of the analysis revealed the clinical efficacy and safety of memantal in treatment of AD.
