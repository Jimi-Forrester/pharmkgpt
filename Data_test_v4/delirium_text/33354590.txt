33354590|t|Revisiting the Role of Physicians in Assisted Living and Residential Care Settings.
33354590|a|As the United States population ages, a higher share of adults is likely to use long-term services and supports. This change increases physicians' need for information about assisted living and residential care (AL/RC) settings, which provide supportive care and housing to older adults. Unlike skilled nursing facilities, states regulate AL/RC settings through varying licensure requirements enforced by state agencies, resulting in differences in the availability of medical and nursing services. Where some settings provide limited skilled nursing care, in others, residents rely on resident care coordinators, or their own physicians to oversee chronic conditions, medications, and treatments. The following narrative review describes key processes of care where physicians may interact with AL/RC operators, staff, and residents, including care planning, managing Alzheimer's disease and related conditions, medication management, and end-of-life planning. Communication and collaboration between physicians and AL/RC operators are a crucial component of care management.
