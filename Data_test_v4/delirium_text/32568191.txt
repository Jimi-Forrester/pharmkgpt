32568191|t|National Dementia BioBank: A Strategy for the Diagnosis and Study of Neurodegenerative Diseases in Mexico.
32568191|a|We recently developed the National Dementia Biobank in Mexico (BioBanco Nacional de Demencias, BND) as a unit for diagnosis, research, and tissue transfer for research purposes. BND is associated with the Facultad de Estudios Superiores Cuautitlan, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM), Mexico. The donation of fluids, brain, and other organs of deceased donors is crucial for understanding the underlying mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases and for the development of successful treatment. Our laboratory research focuses on 1) analysis of the molecular processing of the proteins involved in those neurodegenerative diseases termed tauopathies and 2) the search for biomarkers for the non-invasive and early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.
