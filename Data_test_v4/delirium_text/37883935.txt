37883935|t|Dietary Patterns and Healthy or Unhealthy Aging.
37883935|a|BACKGROUND: The aging process is complex comprising various contributing factors influencing late life conditions and eventual occurrence of chronic diseases that generate high financial and human costs. These factors include genetic proneness, lifestyle conducted throughout life, environmental conditions, as well as dietary aspects, among others, all together modulating precise pathways linked to aging, making longevity a multidimensional event. SUMMARY: Compelling evidence support the concept that nutritional determinants have major impact on the risk of age-associated non-communicable diseases, as well as on mortality. Nutrition research has turned in recent years from considering isolated nutrients or foods to focusing on combinations of foods in dietary patterns in relation to their associations with health outcomes. This narrative review focuses attention on dietary patterns that may contribute to healthy or unhealthy aging and longevity with examples of traditional dietary patterns associated with healthy longevity and reviewing the association of healthy plant-based and unhealthy ultra-processed diets with frailty, a condition that may be considered a hallmark of unhealthy aging. KEY MESSAGES: There is currently accumulated evidence confirming the key role that dietary patterns mainly of plant origin may exert in modifying the risk of age-associated chronic diseases and healthy longevity. These types of dietary models, unlike those in which the use of ultra-processed food is frequent, are associated with a reduced risk of frailty and, consequently, with healthy aging.
