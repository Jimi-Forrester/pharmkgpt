16288128|t|Delirium associated with baclofen withdrawal: a review of common presentations and management strategies.
16288128|a|The authors reviewed 23 published cases of psychiatric symptoms in association with baclofen withdrawal. Delirium, and not other functional psychiatric conditions, arose secondarily from abrupt baclofen cessation. Vulnerability to baclofen-withdrawal delirium appeared to be greater in individuals who received chronic baclofen therapy. Baclofen-withdrawal delirium can be difficult to distinguish from delirium of other etiologies, and unrecognized and inadequately treated baclofen-withdrawal delirium is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Complete resolution of delirium symptoms was possible with reinstatement of baclofen. The clinical management of patients experiencing baclofen-withdrawal delirium includes supportive interventions to reduce complications of delirium until symptoms resolve.
