Increasingly, patients from the elderly population are referred for surgery; however, many studies do not focus on this patient group. We reviewed the outcomes of septuagenarians who underwent lobectomy via an open thoracotomy (OT) or video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) approach to determine whether the VATS approach would result in superior post-operative outcomes. METHODS: Between January 2010 and June 2016, a total of 96 patients aged 70 years or older underwent a lobectomy for non-small cell lung carcinoma. Patients who underwent resection for metastatic disease, small cell lung cancer or neuroendocrine tumour were excluded. Demographic details, early and late post-operative outcomes including post-operative arrhythmia, myocardial infarction, respiratory failure, cerebrovascular events, infection, prolonged air leak, delirium, readmission and 30-day mortality were studied. Mean follow-up duration was 23 +- 19.1 months. RESULTS: Seventy-five patients underwent lobectomy via a VATS approach and 21 patients underwent lobectomy via an OT approach. There was no 30-day mortality and no difference in overall survival between the two techniques (P = 0.25). There was no significant difference between the two techniques with regard to post-operative stroke, myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, pneumonia, delirium or bronchopleural fistula. VATS patients had a significantly shorter mean hospital length of stay (VATS 4.7 days, OT 9.3 days, P = 0.005). CONCLUSION: Septuagenarians with non-small cell lung carcinoma can successfully undergo curative lung resection with a low incidence of post-operative complications.
