38509035|t|Feasibility and Acceptability of Using Wireless Limited Polysomnography to Capture Sleep Before, During, and After Hospitalization for Patients With Planned Cardiothoracic Surgery.
38509035|a|BACKGROUND: Sleep disruption, a common symptom among patients requiring cardiovascular surgery, is a potential risk factor for the development of postoperative delirium. Postoperative delirium is a disorder of acute disturbances in cognition associated with prolonged hospitalization, cognitive decline, and mortality. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of using polysomnography (PSG) to capture sleep in patients with scheduled cardiothoracic surgery. METHODS: Wireless limited PSG assessed sleep at baseline (presurgery at home), postoperatively in the intensive care unit, and at home post hospital discharge. Primary outcomes were quality and completeness of PSG signals, and acceptability by participants and nursing staff. RESULTS: Among 15 patients, PSG data were of high quality, and mean percentage of unscorable data was 5.5% +- 11.1%, 3.7% +- 5.4%, and 3.7% +- 8.4% for baseline, intensive care unit, and posthospitalization measurements, respectively. Nurses and patients found the PSG monitor acceptable. CONCLUSIONS: Wireless, limited PSG to capture sleep across the surgical continuum was feasible, and data were of high quality. Authors of future studies will evaluate associations of sleep indices and development of postoperative delirium in this high-risk population.
