30297099|a|AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of this study is to evaluate standard scalp EEG findings in patients with posterior cortical atrophy (PCA), an atypical variant of Alzheimer's disease (AD). CLINICAL RATIONALE: PCA is a topographically selective variant of AD. Patients with typical AD have an increased likelihood of seizures, which may negatively impact overall functional performance and cognition. It is currently unknown what the typical EEG findings are for patients with PCA. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed on patients identified either with autopsy confirmed (n=13) or clinically (n=126) as PCA. RESULTS: 139 patients were included though only 23 (16.5%) had undergone EEG recording. The EEG was normal in 6 (26%), while an abnormal EEG was present in 17 (74%). Interictal epileptic discharges (IEDs) were found in 2 of the 23 patients (9%). CONCLUSIONS: This study of limited sample size suggests that there may be an increased predilection to find IEDs within PCA when compared to typical AD. Larger cohorts are required to determine frequency of abnormal EEGs in PCA, roles of AEDs in therapy, and in the selection of preferred AED. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Patients with PCA would potentially benefit from an EEG for assessment of IEDs which may provide the clinician with a therapeutic opportunity.
