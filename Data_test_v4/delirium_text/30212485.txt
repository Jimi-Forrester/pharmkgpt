30212485|t|Readmissions of adults within three age groups following hospitalization for pneumonia: Analysis from the Nationwide Readmissions Database.
30212485|a|BACKGROUND: While 30-day readmissions following hospitalization for pneumonia have been well-studied in the elderly, their burden in young adults remains poorly understood. OBJECTIVE: To study patterns of readmissions following hospitalization for pneumonia across age groups and insurance payers. METHODS: In the Nationwide Readmission Database for the years 2013 and 2014 we identified all adults (>=18 years) discharged alive after a hospitalization with the primary diagnosis of pneumonia, and examined rates of readmissions within 30-days of discharge. Using covariates included in the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services risk-adjustment model for pneumonia readmissions in a multivariable regression model for survey data, we identified predictors of 30-day readmission. RESULTS: We identified 629,939 index pneumonia hospitalizations with a weighted estimate of 1,472,069 nationally. Overall, 16.2% of patients were readmitted within 30 days of their hospitalization for pneumonia, with 30-day readmission rates of 12.4% in the 18-44 year age-group, 16.1% in the 45-64 year age-group, and 16.7% in the >=65-year age-group. In risk-adjusted analyses, compared with elderly, middle-aged adults were more likely to be readmitted (risk-adjusted OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.03-1.07). Mean cost per readmission was also highest for this age group at $15,976. CONCLUSION: Middle-aged adults experience substantial rates of 30-day readmission that are comparable to those over 65 years of age, with a higher cost per readmission event. Future efforts are needed to identify potential interventions to alleviate the high burden of pneumonia readmissions in middle-aged adults.
