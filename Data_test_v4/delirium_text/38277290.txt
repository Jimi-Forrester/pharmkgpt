MRI-based hippocampal volume measurement using artificial intelligence offers new insights into early diagnosis and intervention in AD progression. OBJECTIVE: This study, involving 483 AD patients, 756 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 968 normal controls (NC), investigated the predictive capability of MRI-based hippocampus volume measurements for AD risk using artificial intelligence and evidence-based medicine. METHODS: Utilizing data from ADNI and OASIS-brains databases, three convolutional neural networks (InceptionResNetv2, Densenet169, and SEResNet50) were employed for automated AD classification based on structural MRI imaging. A multitask deep learning model and a densely connected 3D convolutional network were utilized. Additionally, a systematic meta-analysis explored the value of MRI-based hippocampal volume measurement in predicting AD occurrence and progression, drawing on 23 eligible articles from PubMed and Embase databases. RESULTS: InceptionResNetv2 outperformed other networks, achieving 99.75% accuracy and 100% AUC for AD-NC classification and 99.16% accuracy and 100% AUC for MCI-NC classification. Notably, at a 512x512 size, InceptionResNetv2 demonstrated a classification accuracy of 94.29% and an AUC of 98% for AD-NC and 97.31% accuracy and 98% AUC for MCI-NC. CONCLUSIONS: The study concludes that MRI-based hippocampal volume changes effectively predict AD onset and progression, facilitating early intervention and prevention.
