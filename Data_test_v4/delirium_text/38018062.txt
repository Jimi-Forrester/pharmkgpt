38018062|t|[Chinese expert consensus on the prevention and treatment of postoperative delirium of cardiovascular surgery].
38018062|a|Postoperative delirium of cardiovascular surgery occurs in up to 26%-52% of patients after cardiovascular surgery and is associated with adverse outcomes, including increased hospital length of stay, higher cost of care, higher rates of readmission. The combination of multiple factors leads to postoperative delirium of cardiovascular surgery, including preoperative (previous psychiatric conditions and cognitive disfunction, cerebrovascular disease, age, cardiac insufficiency, and so on), intraoperative (duration of surgery>5 h, emergency surgery, anesthetic drugs, direct myocardial injury, and so on) and postoperative (pain, sleep disturbance, Deep sedation, duration of mechanical ventilation>72 h) risk factors. On the basis of the latest literature at home and abroad and the clinical experience of many experts, the Cardiac Critical Care Branch of China International Exchange and Promotive Association for Medical and Health sought to develop a consensus document"Chinese expert consensus on the prevention and treatment of postoperative delirium of cardiovascular surgery", in order to standardize the management of postoperative delirium of cardiovascular surgery and improve the prognosis of patients.
