36168674|a|BACKGROUND: Insomnia, sleep apnoea and sleep loss are risk factors for the development of cardiovascular diseases. Most research on sleep disturbances includes patients with heart failure, while the role of sleep in sudden cardiac arrest survivors (SCA) has been only partially investigated and understood. Sleep-related breathing disorders and obstructive sleep apnoea increase illness and mortality in the aftermath of SCA. Also, post-traumatic stress is evident in SCA survivors, where sleep disruptions are some of the main symptoms of the condition. Consequently, it is important to identify sleep problems in SCA survivors at an early stage to avoid unnecessary suffering. PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate registered nurses' perceptions of SCA survivors' sleep, both in hospital and after discharge. METHODS: This was an explorative interview study with a phenomenographic approach. Nineteen registered nurses (RNs) varying in age, sex and years in the profession participated. FINDINGS: The nurses' perceptions of SCA survivors' sleep were categorized as: "The observer - noticing behaviours, emotions and habits of the patient that affect sleep", "The oblivious witness - attitudes that hinder the ability to recognise sleep behaviours", and "The practitioner - advising and medicating for sleep". The outcome space showed that the nurses detected both obvious and subtle signs relating to patients' sleep. However, attitudes hindering the recognition of sleep behaviours were independent of acting as an observer or practitioner. If nothing unforeseen was observed, or if the patient did not spontaneously raise the subject, sleep was considered less important than other health problems in SCA survivors. CONCLUSIONS: Although the nurses knew that SCA survivors suffered from poor sleep, they failed to reflect on the consequences for the patient. Nurses' feelings of insufficient knowledge about sleep, as well as their omittance of sleep in the follow-up documentation could leave sleep issues unaddressed and cause unnecessary patient suffering. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Nurses need increased knowledge and training to enable them to detect subtle signs of sleep problems in SCA survivors.
