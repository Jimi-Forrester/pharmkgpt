39462229|t|From bite to brain: Neuro-immune interactions in food allergy.
39462229|a|Immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated food allergies are reported to affect around 3.5% of children and 2.4% of adults, with symptoms varying in range and severity. While being the gold standard for diagnosis, oral food challenges are burdensome, and diagnostic tools based on specific IgE can be flawed. Furthering our understanding of the mechanisms behind food allergy onset, severity and persistence could help reveal immune profiles associated with the disease, to ultimately aid in diagnosis. Alterations to cytokine levels and immune cell ratios have been identified, though further research is needed to fully capture the heterogenous nature of food allergy. Moreover, the existence of such immune alterations also raises the question of potential wider systemic effects. For example, recent research has emphasised the existence and impact of neuro-immune interactions and implicated behavioural and neurological changes associated with food allergy. This review will provide an overview of such food allergy-driven neuro-immune interactions, with the aim of emphasising the importance of furthering our understanding of the immune mechanisms underlying IgE-mediated food allergy.
