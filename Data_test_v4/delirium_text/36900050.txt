36900050|t|Autophagy-Related Gene WD Repeat Domain 45B Promotes Tumor Proliferation and Migration of Hepatocellular Carcinoma through the Akt/mTOR Signaling Pathway.
36900050|a|Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly aggressive malignant tumor. It has been found that autophagy plays a role both as a tumor promoter and inhibitor in HCC carcinogenesis. However, the mechanism behind is still unveiled. This study aims to explore the functions and mechanism of the key autophagy-related proteins, to shed light on novel clinical diagnoses and treatment targets of HCC. Bioinformation analyses were performed by using data from public databases including TCGA, ICGC, and UCSC Xena. The upregulated autophagy-related gene WDR45B was identified and validated in human liver cell line LO2, human HCC cell line HepG2 and Huh-7. Immunohistochemical assay (IHC) was also performed on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues of 56 HCC patients from our pathology archives. By using qRT-PCR and Western blots we found that high expression of WDR45B influenced the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. Autophagy marker LC3- II/LC3-I was downregulated, and p62/SQSTM1 was upregulated after knockdown of WDR45B. The effects of WDR45B knockdown on autophagy and Akt/mTOR signaling pathways can be reversed by the autophagy inducer rapamycin. Moreover, proliferation and migration of HCC can be inhibited after the knockdown of WDR45B through the CCK8 assay, wound-healing assay and Transwell cell migration and invasion assay. Therefore, WDR45B may become a novel biomarker for HCC prognosis assessment and potential target for molecular therapy.
