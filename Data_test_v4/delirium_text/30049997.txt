30049997|t|Fe, Zn and Se Bioavailability in Chicken Meat Emulsions Enriched with Minerals, Hydroxytyrosol and Extra Virgin Olive Oil as Measured by Caco-2 Cell Model.
30049997|a|There is a high demand for functional meat products due to increasing concern about food and health. In this work, Zn and Se bioavailability was increased in chicken meat emulsions that are enriched with Hydroxytyrosol (HXT), a phenolic compound obtained from olive leaf. Six different chicken emulsions were elaborated. Three were made with broiler chicken meat supplemented with inorganic Zn and Se: control, one with HXT (50 ppm) added and one with HXT (50 ppm) and Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) (9.5%) added; and, three were made with chicken meat from chickens fed a diet that was supplemented with organic Zn and Se: control, one with HXT (50 ppm) added and one with HXT (50 ppm) and EVOO (9.5%) added. The samples were digested in vitro and the percent decomposition of phenolic compounds was measured by HPLC. Mineral availability (Fe, Zn and Se) was measured by cell culture of the Caco-2 cell line and the results were compared with mineral standards (Fe, Zn, and Se). The data obtained showed that neither HXT resistance to digestion nor Fe availability was affected by the presence of organic Zn and Se or phenolic compounds. Zn uptake increased in the presence of HXT, but not when its organic form was used, while Se uptake increased but it was not affected by the presence of HXT. It was concluded that the enrichment of meat-endogenously with organic minerals and exogenously with phenolic compounds-could be considered an interesting strategy for future research and applications in the current meat industry.
