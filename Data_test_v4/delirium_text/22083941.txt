22083941|a|Aging is defined as a normal decline in survival with advancing age; however, the recent researches have showed that physiological functions of the body change during the aging process. Majority of the changes are often subject to a higher risk of developing diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, type II diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, as well as the dysregulated immune and inflammatory disorders. Aging process is controlled by a complicated and precise signaling network that involved in energy homeostasis, cellular metabolism and stress resistance. Over the past few decades, research in natural dietary compounds by various organism and animal models provides a new strategy for anti-aging. Natural dietary compounds act through a variety mechanisms to extend lifespan and prevent age-related diseases. This review summarizes the current understanding on signaling pathways of aging and knowledge and underlying mechanism of natural dietary compounds that provide potential application on anti-aging and improve heath in human.
