Fucoxanthin, derived from marine brown algae, presents a promising candidate for the development of effective therapeutic strategies. HYPOTHESIS AND PURPOSE: The relationship between neurodegenerative disease management and fucoxanthin has not yet been clarified. This study focuses on the fundamental mechanisms and targets of fucoxanthin in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease management, showing that communication between the brain and the gut contributes to neurodegenerative diseases and early diagnosis of ophthalmic diseases. This paper also presents, new insights for future therapeutic directions based on the integrated application of artificial intelligence. CONCLUSION: Fucoxanthin primarily binds to amyloid fibrils with spreading properties such as Abeta, tau, and alpha-synuclein to reduce their accumulation levels, alleviate inflammatory factors, and restore mitochondrial membranes to prevent oxidative stress via Nrf2 and Akt signaling pathways, involving reduction of specific secretases. In addition, fucoxanthin may serve as a preventive diagnosis for neurodegenerative diseases through ophthalmic disorders. It can modulate gut microbes and has potential for the alleviation and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.
