37641506|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To examine the impact of substance use disorders (SUDs) on critical illness and the role of critical care providers in treating SUDs. We discuss emerging evidence supporting hospital-based addiction treatment and highlight the clinical and research innovations needed to elevate the standards of care for patients with SUDs in the intensive care unit (ICU) amidst staggering individual and public health consequences. RECENT FINDINGS: Despite the rapid increase of SUDs in recent years, with growing implications for critical care, dedicated studies focused on ICU patients with SUDs remain scant. Available data demonstrate SUDs are major risk factors for the development and severity of critical illness and are associated with poor outcomes. ICU patients with SUDs experience mutually reinforcing effects of substance withdrawal and pain, which amplify risks and consequences of delirium, and complicate management of comorbid conditions. Hospital-based addiction treatment can dramatically improve the health outcomes of hospitalized patients with SUDs and should begin in the ICU. SUMMARY: SUDs have a significant impact on critical illness and post-ICU outcomes. High-quality cohort and treatment studies designed specifically for ICU patients with SUDs are needed to define best practices and improve health outcomes in this vulnerable population.
