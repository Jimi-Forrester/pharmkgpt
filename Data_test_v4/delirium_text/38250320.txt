38250320|t|Reduction of Postoperative Delirium and Opioid Use in Hip Fracture Patients Through Utilization of Emergency Department Physician Administered Regional Nerve Blocks.
38250320|a|Introduction: The complication of delirium for hip fracture patients is a predictor of mortality. Use of opioid medication increases the incidence of delirium in the pre- and postoperative periods. Regional nerve blocks are effective in managing acute pain for acute hip fractures. This study aims to evaluate the utilization of ED physicians to perform fascia iliaca nerve blocks on hip fracture patients to decrease the incidence of delirium by decreasing usage of opioid medication. Methods: A quality improvement project for performing regional nerve blocks on patients with femoral neck fractures was implemented during fiscal year 2019. Data was collected retrospectively for frequency of ED nerve block procedures, amount of opioid medication use, and incidence of delirium in patients diagnosed with hip fracture. This data was compared to baseline data to determine success of the intervention. Results: Utilization of regional nerve blocks in the ED increased from 2% in 2018 to 96% in 2021 and 89% in 2022. Preoperative opioid usage decreased from 38 MMEs to 16.9 and 18 MMEs respectively. Daily average MMEs decreased from 34 to 12.1 and 14 respectively. Postoperative delirium decreased from 6% in 2018 to 0% from 2020 to 2022. Discussion: ED provider administration of fascia iliaca blocks and follow-up is a novel practice in our region to decrease the adverse effects of opiate use and decrease delirium rates. There was a reduction in length of stay and increased discharge home rate despite the Covid-19 pandemic. Conclusion: Administration of regional nerve blocks by ED physicians to hip fracture patients presenting to the ED results in a decrease in opioid medication usage. This also results in a decreased delirium rates in the hip fracture patient population.
