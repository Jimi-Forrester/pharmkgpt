36338943|t|An updated analysis of the association between CD2-associated protein gene rs9349407 polymorphism and Alzheimer's disease in Chinese population.
36338943|a|Background: Since 2011, three large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have confirmed that the CD2AP rs9349407 polymorphism is significantly connected with Alzheimer's disease (AD) in individuals of European descent. Subsequently, this association has been replicated in European populations, but is unclear whether it can be replicated in Chinese. Recently, the correlation between rs9349407 and AD in the Chinese population has become a research hotspot. Objective: To explore the association between rs9349407 polymorphism and AD in the Chinese population. Materials and methods: Firstly, based on the exclusion and inclusion criteria, we selected 11 independent studies from 8 articles exploring the correlation between rs9349407 variation and AD in Chinese. Secondly, we conducted a meta-analysis based on fixed and random effect models and conducted a heterogeneity test. Thirdly, we used the additive model, dominant model, and recessive model for subgroup analysis. Results: We demonstrated that the CD2AP rs9349407 polymorphism increases AD susceptibility in Chinese populations (OR = 1.33, 95% CI = 1.08-1.64, P = 7.45E-03), which is consistent with the effect observed in Caucasian populations. Additionally, subgroup analysis showed that rs9349407 under the additive model (GG + CC vs. GC, OR = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.61-0.97, P = 2.04E-02) and dominant model (GG + GC vs. CC, OR = 0.49, 95% CI = 0.32-0.74, P = 8.51E-04) were also significantly correlated with AD susceptibility, but not under the recessive model (GG vs. GC + CC, OR = 0.77, 95% CI = 0.58-1.03, P = 7.44E-02). Conclusion: These existing data suggest that rs9349307 is significantly correlated with the susceptibility to AD in the Chinese population, but future studies with large samples are needed to confirm our findings.
