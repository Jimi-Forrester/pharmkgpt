20951388|a|PICALM might play an important role in AD pathology through participating in altering synaptic vesicle cycling or APP endocytosis. A recent genome-wide study (GWAS) identified a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs3851179 in the 5' to the PICALM gene strongly associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) in Caucasians. In order to assess the involvement of the PICALM polymorphism in the risk of developing late-onset AD (LOAD), we analyzed the genotype and allele distributions of these three polymorphisms in 609 Han Chinese subjects. Our data showed no significant association between the PICALM rs3851179 polymorphism and LOAD (genotype distribution: P=0.43; allele frequency: P=0.25, odds ratio=0.87, 95% confidence interval=0.68 to 1.10), even after statistical adjustment for age, gender and apolipoprotein E (APOE) status. Our results suggest that the PICALM polymorphism may not play a major role in the development of LOAD in the Han Chinese population.
