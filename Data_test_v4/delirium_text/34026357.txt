34026357|a|BACKGROUND: Several pieces of evidence from in vitro studies showed that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) promotes proliferation and differentiation of neural stem/progenitor cells (NSCs) into neurons. Moreover, the JAK2 pathway was proposed to be associated with mouse NSC proliferation. BDNF could activate the STAT-3 pathway and induce proliferation in mouse NSCs. However, its effects on proliferation are not fully understood and JAK/STAT pathway was proposed to play a role in this activity. METHODS: In the present study, the effects of BDNF on cell proliferation and neurite outgrowth of Alzheimer's disease (AD) induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)-derived human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) were examined. Moreover, a specific signal transduction pathway important in cell proliferation was investigated using a JAK2 inhibitor (AG490) to clarify the role of that pathway. RESULTS: The proliferative effect of BDNF was remarkably observed as an increase in Ki-67 positive cells. The cell number of hNPCs was significantly increased after BDNF treatment represented by cellular metabolic activity of the cells measured by MTT assay. This noticeable effect was statistically shown at 20 ng/ml of BDNF treatment. BDNF, however, did not promote neurite outgrowth but increased neuronal cell number. It was found that AG490 suppressed hNPCs proliferation. However, this inhibitor partially decreased BDNF-induced hNPCs proliferation. These results demonstrated the potential role of BDNF for the amelioration of AD through the increase of AD-derived hNPCs number.
