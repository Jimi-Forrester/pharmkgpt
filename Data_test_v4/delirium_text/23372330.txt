23372330|a|Central pontine myelinolysis is a demyelinating condition affecting the pons characterized by an acute progressive quadriplegia, dysarthria, dysphagia, and alterations of consciousness. Pathologic features include prominent demyelination in the central pons with sparing of axons and neurons. This condition is usually associated with systemic disorders such as hyponatremia, chronic alcoholism, liver failure, severe burns, malignant neoplasms, hemorrhagic pancreatitis, hemodialysis, and sepsis. There are limited reports of psychosis in patients with central pontine/extrapontine myelinolysis (CPEM). We have described a case of CPEM with psychosis as a complication which recovered completely with treatment given for short duration using low dose atypical antipsychotic (quetiapine). We also discuss etiopathology and clinical outcome of psychosis in this rare neurological disorder.
