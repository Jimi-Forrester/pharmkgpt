33961071|a|PURPOSE: Hip fractures are a common health problem among the elderly with an increasing incidence. They are associated with high mortality and morbidity. Optimal pain management remains challenging and inadequate pain control is known for negatively affecting outcomes. Loco-regional anaesthetics (LRA) have been proven to benefit pain management and to lower the risks of opioid use and -related side effects. We aimed to evaluate the use and efficacy of different LRA in elderly hip fracture patients. METHODS: Single-center cohort study of elderly hip fracture patients, who were treated in central Switzerland. We compared patients who received LRA in the form of a femoral nerve block (FNB) or a continuous femoral nerve catheter (CFNC) with patients who did not receive LRA. Primary outcomes were pain-as measured in perioperative morphine use-hospital length of stay (HLOS), postoperative complications, postoperative falls and mortality. RESULTS: 407 patients were included for analysis. Mean age was 85.2 (SD6.3). There was a significant difference in intraoperative morphine use between the groups (p = 0.007). Postoperative morphine use differed significantly and was lowest in patients with FNB and highest in patients without LRA (p < 0.001). The use of LRA was a significant predictor for postoperative morphine use for postoperative morphine use at the recovery room and for postoperative morphine use 48 h after surgery. No significant differences were found in postoperative complications, a significant difference was found in 1-year mortality. CONCLUSIONS: This article shows that LRA in the form of FNB and CFNC causes a significant decrease in postoperative opioid consumption. Differences between single-shot FNB or CFNC were minimal. There were no significant differences in clinical outcomes such as HLOS, delirium, 30-day and 90-day mortality and postoperative falls. We suggest that use of LRA should be incorporated in the perioperative treatment of elderly patients with a hip fracture. For future research, we recommend evaluating the number of postoperative complications and mortality.
