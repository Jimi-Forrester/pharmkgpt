39267028|a|BACKGROUND: Pre-hospital emergency technicians are crucial in managing patients with acute psychiatric symptoms. They must quickly assess the condition, make a primary diagnosis, and refer the patient to the appropriate treatment center. Insufficient skills in these situations can cause serious harm. Educating technicians on dealing with these patients may enhance their knowledge and skills; however, we do not know the extent and longevity of this improvement and which areas are affected. This study investigates the impact of training on pre-hospital emergency technicians' knowledge and skills. METHODS: This quasi-experimental study involved pre-hospital emergency technicians in Robat Karim and Nasim Shahr counties from December 2022 to January 2022. The technicians received workshops on interacting with psychiatric patients. The training topics included the basic principles of coping with a psychiatric patient. They also covered a step-by-step approach to dealing with an aggressive patient, dealing with a patient threatening suicide, managing agitation, managing a patient suffering from panic attacks, and finally dealing with a delirious patient. A pre-test assessed their baseline knowledge and skills, followed by a post-test after training and another test three months later. The test results were analyzed. RESULTS: This study involved forty male participants ranging in age from 25 to 44 and with work experience ranging from five to twenty years. As a result of training in dealing with acute psychiatric patients, technicians developed significant skills and knowledge immediately after training, and these improvements remained significant three months after training. Nevertheless, the correct answers decreased during the three-month follow-up compared to the pre-test. Education was less effective at managing panic, delirium, and agitation. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, technicians' knowledge and skills can be effectively enhanced through training; however, the impact diminishes with time. Theories and practical methods, periodic repetition, and real-world internships are the best ways to maximize training effectiveness.
