36290915|t|Spectral Properties Echoing the Tautomerism of Milrinone and Its Application to Fe3+ Ion Sensing and Protein Staining.
36290915|a|Knowledge on the spectral properties of the tautomers of milrinone (MLR) in solvents and solid-state, as well as under light conditions is of critical importance from both theoretical and practical points of view. Herein, we investigated the spectral properties of MLR in different conditions using UV-Vis and fluorescence spectroscopies. The experimental results demonstrated that MLR can undergo the tautomerization reaction induced by solvent polarity, light and pH, eliciting four tautomeric structures (enol, keto, anion, and cation forms). The interesting multi-functional groups in MLR enable it to coordinate with metal ions or to recognize gust molecules by H-bonding. In the use of MLR as an excited-state intermolecular proton transfer (inter-ESPT) fluorescent probe, a highly sensitive and selective analysis of Fe3+ was developed, which offered a sensitive detection of Fe3+ with the detection limit of 3.5 nM. More importantly, MLR exhibited the ability of anchoring proteins and led to the recognition-driven turn-on inter-ESPT process, highlighting the potential for the probe to image proteins in electrophoresis gels. The spectral experimental results revealed the possible degradation mechanism, so that we can better understand the side effects of oral preparations. The use of the available drug as an inter-ESPT fluorescent probe is simple and accurate, providing a good method for Fe3+ ion sensing and protein staining.
