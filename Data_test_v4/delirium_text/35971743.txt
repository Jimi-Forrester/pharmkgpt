35971743|a|The aggregation of amyloidogenic proteins is a pathological hallmark of various neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In these diseases, oligomeric intermediates or toxic aggregates of amyloids cause neuronal damage and degeneration. Despite the substantial effort made over recent decades to implement therapeutic interventions, these neurodegenerative diseases are not yet understood at the molecular level. In many cases, multiple disease-causing amyloids overlap in a sole pathological feature or a sole disease-causing amyloid represents multiple pathological features. Various amyloid pathologies can coexist in the same brain with or without clinical presentation and may even occur in individuals without disease. From sparse data, speculation has arisen regarding the coaggregation of amyloids with disparate amyloid species and other biomolecules, which are the same characteristics that make diagnostics and drug development challenging. However, advances in research related to biomolecular condensates and structural analysis have been used to overcome some of these challenges. Considering the development of these resources and techniques, herein we review the cross-seeding of amyloidosis, for example, involving the amyloids amyloid beta, tau, alpha-synuclein, and human islet amyloid polypeptide, and their cross-inhibition by transthyretin and BRICHOS. The interplay of nucleic acid-binding proteins, such as prions, TAR DNA-binding protein 43, fused in sarcoma/translated in liposarcoma, and fragile X mental retardation polyglycine, with nucleic acids in the pathology of neurodegeneration are also described, and we thereby highlight the potential clinical applications in central nervous system therapy.
