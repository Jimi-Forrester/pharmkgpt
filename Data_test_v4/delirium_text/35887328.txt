35887328|t|Synthesis of Metal-Organic Frameworks Quantum Dots Composites as Sensors for Endocrine-Disrupting Chemicals.
35887328|a|Hazardous chemical compounds such as endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are widespread and part of the materials we use daily. Among these compounds, bisphenol A (BPA) is the most common endocrine-disrupting chemical and is prevalent due to the chemical raw materials used to manufacture thermoplastic polymers, rigid foams, and industrial coatings. General exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals constitutes a serious health hazard, especially to reproductive systems, and can lead to transgenerational diseases in adults due to exposure to these chemicals over several years. Thus, it is necessary to develop sensors for early detection of endocrine-disrupting chemicals. In recent years, the use of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as sensors for EDCs has been explored due to their distinctive characteristics, such as wide surface area, outstanding chemical fastness, structural tuneability, gas storage, molecular separation, proton conductivity, and catalyst activity, among others which can be modified to sense hazardous environmental pollutants such as EDCs. In order to improve the versatility of MOFs as sensors, semiconductor quantum dots have been introduced into the MOF pores to form metal-organic frameworks/quantum dots composites. These composites possess a large optical absorption coefficient, low toxicity, direct bandgap, formidable sensing capacity, high resistance to change under light and tunable visual qualities by varying the size and compositions, which make them useful for applications as sensors for probing of dangerous and risky environmental contaminants such as EDCs and more. In this review, we explore various synthetic strategies of (MOFs), quantum dots (QDs), and metal-organic framework quantum dots composites (MOFs@QDs) as efficient compounds for the sensing of ecological pollutants, contaminants, and toxicants such as EDCs. We also summarize various compounds or materials used in the detection of BPA as well as the sensing ability and capability of MOFs, QDs, and MOFs@QDs composites that can be used as sensors for EDCs and BPA.
