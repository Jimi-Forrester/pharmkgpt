37371389|t|Distribution of Iron, Copper, Zinc and Cadmium in Glia, Their Influence on Glial Cells and Relationship with Neurodegenerative Diseases.
37371389|a|Recent data on the distribution and influence of copper, zinc and cadmium in glial cells are summarized. This review also examines the relationship between those metals and their role in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer disease, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson disease and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, which have become a great challenge for today's physicians. The studies suggest that among glial cells, iron has the highest concentration in oligodendrocytes, copper in astrocytes and zinc in the glia of hippocampus and cortex. Previous studies have shown neurotoxic effects of copper, iron and manganese, while zinc can have a bidirectional effect, i.e., neurotoxic but also neuroprotective effects depending on the dose and disease state. Recent data point to the association of metals with neurodegeneration through their role in the modulation of protein aggregation. Metals can accumulate in the brain with aging and may be associated with age-related diseases.
