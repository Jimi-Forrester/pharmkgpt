36316282|a|Amyloid-beta (Abeta) in the form of neurotoxic aggregates is regarded as the main pathological initiator and key therapeutic target of Alzheimer's disease. However, anti-Abeta drug development has been impeded by the lack of a target needed for structure-based drug design and low permeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). An attractive therapeutic strategy is the development of amyloid-based anti-Abeta peptidomimetics that exploit the self-assembling nature of Abeta and penetrate the BBB. Herein, we designed a dimeric peptide drug candidate based on the N-terminal fragment of Abeta, DAB, found to cross the BBB and solubilize Abeta oligomers and fibrils. Administration of DAB reduced amyloid burden in 5XFAD mice, and downregulated neuroinflammation and prevented memory impairment in the Y-maze test. Peptide mapping assays and molecular docking studies were utilized to elucidate DAB-Abeta interaction. To further understand the active regions of DAB, we assessed the dissociative activity of DAB with sequence modifications.
