31987795|a|Neurodegenerative diseases are a great concern because of aging worldwide population. Despite substantial effort to advance our understanding of the etiology and potential treatment of neurodegeneration, there remains a paucity of information with respect to this complex disease process. Interestingly, stress has been implicated among the potential mechanisms implicated in neurodegenerative pathology. Given the increase in chronic stress in modern society, this premise warrants further investigation. The aim of this review is to evaluate the influence of stress on neurodegeneration, the effect of neurodegenerative diseases diagnosis on stress, and therapeutic strategies for neurodegenerative diseases with a special focus on stress reduction. Neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's Disease showed an acceleration in disease progression and a worsening of symptoms under stress. Some therapies (e.g., yoga, meditation) focused on reducing stress showed beneficial effects against neurodegeneration. Nevertheless, more studies are necessary in order to completely understand the implications of stress in neurodegeneration and the usefulness of stress reduction in the treatment thereof.
