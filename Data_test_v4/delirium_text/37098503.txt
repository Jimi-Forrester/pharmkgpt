37098503|a|BACKGROUND: Medical device-related pressure injuries(MDRPI) are prevalent and attracting more attention. During ambulance transfer, the shear force caused by braking and acceleration; extensive medical equipment crowed in a narrow space add external risk factors for MDRPIs. However, there is insufficient research on the relationship between MDRPIs and ambulance transfers. This study aims to clarify the prevalence and characteristics of MDRPI during ambulance transfer. METHOD: A descriptive observational study was conducted with convenience sampling. Before starting the study, six PI specialist nurses certified by the Chinese Nursing Association trained emergency department nurses for three MDRPI and Braden Scale sessions, one hour for each session. Data and images of PIs and MDRPIs are uploaded via the OA system by emergency department nurses and reviewed by these six specialist nurses. The information collection begins on 1 July 2022 and ends on 1 August 2022. Demographic and clinical characteristics and a list of medical devices were collected by emergency nurses using a screening form developed by researchers. RESULTS: One hundred one referrals were eventually included. The mean age of participants was (58.3 +- 11.69) years, predominantly male (67.32%, n = 68), with a mean BMI of 22.48 +- 2.2. The mean referral time among participants was 2.26 +- 0.26 h, the mean BRADEN score was 15.32 +- 2.06, 53.46% (n = 54) of participants were conscious, 73.26% (n = 74) were in the supine position, 23.76% (n = 24) were in the semi-recumbent position, and only 3 (2.9%) were in the lateral position. Eight participants presented with MDRPIs, and all MDRPIs are stage 1. Patients with spinal injuries are most prone to MDRPIs (n = 6). The jaw is the area most prone to MDRPIs, caused by the cervical collar (40%, n = 4), followed by the heel (30%, n = 3) and nose bridge (20%, n = 2) caused by the respiratory devices and spinal board. CONCLUSION: MDRPIs are more prevalent during long ambulance referrals than in some inpatient settings. The characteristics and related high-risk devices are also different. The prevention of MDRPIs during ambulance referrals deserves more research.
