32650482|t|Nutraceutical Compounds Targeting Inflammasomes in Human Diseases.
32650482|a|The macromolecular complex known as "inflammasome" is defined as an intracellular multi-protein complex composed of a sensor receptor (PRR), an adaptor protein and an effector enzyme (caspase-1), which oligomerize when they sense danger, such as how the NLR family, AIM-2 and RIG-1 receptors protect the body against danger via cytokine secretion. Within the NLR members, NLRP3 is the most widely known and studied inflammasome and has been linked to many diseases. Nowadays, people's interest in their lifestyles and nutritional habits is increasing, mainly due to the large number of diseases that seem to be related to both. The term "nutraceutical" has recently emerged as a hybrid term between "nutrition" and "pharmacological" and it refers to a wide range of bioactive compounds contained in food with relevant effects on human health. The relationship between these compounds and diseases based on inflammatory processes has been widely exposed and the compounds stand out as an alternative to the pathological consequences that inflammatory processes may have, beyond their defense and repair action. Against this backdrop, here we review the results of studies using several nutraceutical compounds in common diseases associated with the inflammation and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasomes complex. In general, it was found that there is a wide range of nutraceuticals with effects through different molecular pathways that affect the activation of the inflammasome complex, with positive effects mainly in cardiovascular, neurological diseases, cancer and type 2 diabetes.
