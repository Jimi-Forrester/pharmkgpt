Although diverse biomarkers have been established for Parkinson's disease (PD), no widely accepted markers have been identified in MSA. Pyruvate and lactate are the end-product of glycolysis and crucial for brain metabolism. However, their correlation with MSA remains unclear. Moreover, it is elusive how lifestyles modify these metabolites. Methods: To investigate the correlation and diagnostic value of plasma pyruvate and lactate levels in MSA and PD. Moreover, we explored how lifestyle-related metabolites interact with these metabolites in determining the disease risk. We assayed the 3 metabolites in pyruvate/lactate and 6 in the tea/coffee metabolic pathways by targeted mass spectrometry and evaluate their interactions and performance in diagnosis and differentiation between MSA and PD. Results: We found that 7 metabolites were significantly different between MSA, PD and healthy controls (HCs). Particularly, pyruvate was increased in PD while significantly decreased in MSA patients. Moreover, the tea/coffee metabolites were negatively associated with the pyruvate level in HCs, but not in MSA and PD patients. Using machine-learning models, we showed that the combination of pyruvate and tea/coffee metabolites diagnosed MSA (AUC = 0.878) and PD (AUC = 0.833) with good performance. Additionally, pyruvate had good performance in distinguishing MSA from PD (AUC = 0.860), and the differentiation increased (AUC = 0.922) when combined with theanine and 1,3-dimethyluric acid. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that pyruvate correlates reversely with MSA and PD, and may play distinct roles in their pathogenesis, which can be modified by lifestyle-related tea/coffee metabolites.
