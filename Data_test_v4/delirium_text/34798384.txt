34798384|a|Although many screening tools for delirium are available, delirium is still occasionally overlooked or misdiagnosed. One of the reasons for this is the lack of brief screening tools that do not require specialized training to use. The 4 'A's test (the 4AT) is a validated screening tool for delirium that can be administered in a very short time without specialized training. Herein, we evaluated the reliability and validity of the Japanese version of the 4AT (the 4AT-J). A total of 150 patients aged >= 65 years were enrolled. Their demographics and clinical characteristics were obtained within 24 hr of their hospitalization. On each patient's high-risk day of developing delirium, the 4AT-J was administered by a nurse, and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-V) and the Japanese version of Delirium Rating Scale-Revised-98 (DRS-98-J) were administered by a psychiatrist. Our analyses revealed that when a cut-off score of 4, the 4AT-J showed high sensitivity and specificity. The Cronbach's alpha-coefficient was similar to that of the original version. A receiver operating curve analysis showed sufficient power of the 4AT-J to discriminate delirium. The 4AT-J showed adequate reliability and validity for delirium screening in elderly patients.
