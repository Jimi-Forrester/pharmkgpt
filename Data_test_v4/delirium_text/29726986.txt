29726986|t|Propensity-matched analysis of a side-clamp versus an anastomosis assist device in cases of isolated coronary artery bypass grafting.
29726986|a|OBJECTIVES: The use of an anastomosis assist device during coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is considered less invasive for the ascending aorta than the use of a side-biting clamp (Side-clamp) and to possibly be associated with a lower incidence of postoperative stroke. However, this benefit has not yet been clearly demonstrated. This study was to evaluate whether the use of an anastomosis assist device will minimize the postoperative stroke and other complications in patients undergoing off-pump CABG in comparison with the use of the Side-clamp. METHODS: Patients undergoing isolated off-pump CABG were retrospectively reviewed using the Japan Adult Cardiovascular Surgery Database (2013-2016). We performed a one-to-one matched analysis based on the estimated propensity scores of those who underwent off-pump CABG with an anastomosis assist device (Device group, n = 14 213) or a side-biting clamp (Side-clamp group, n = 7374) and obtained 2 cohorts (n = 7348 each). We compared the early outcomes and the details of postoperative complications using the Pearson's chi2 test. P-values of <0.05 were considered to indicate statistical significance. RESULTS: No significant differences were observed in the rates of 30-day mortality (Side-clamp versus Device: 0.8% vs 0.8%, P = 0.93) or stroke (1.4% vs 1.4%, P = 0.46). Transient ischaemic attack/reversible ischaemic neurological deficit/delirium occurred more frequently in the Side-clamp group (1.3% vs 0.9%, P = 0.020), whereas new-onset atrial fibrillation (11.0% vs 12.8%, P < 0.001) and prolonged ventilation (2.0% vs 2.9%, P < 0.001) occurred more frequently in the Device group. There was no difference in the length of intensive care unit stay. CONCLUSIONS: The use of an anastomosis assist device partially provided better results with regard to the transient neurological complications; however, no overall benefit was observed in this study.
