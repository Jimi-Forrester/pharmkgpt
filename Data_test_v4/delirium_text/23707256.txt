23707256|a|Modulation of gamma-secretase activity is a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Herein we report on the synthesis of carprofen- and tocopherol-derived small-molecule modulators carrying terpene moieties as lipophilic membrane anchors. Additionally, these modulators are equipped with an acidic moiety, which contributes to the desired modulatory effect on the gamma-secretase with decreased formation of Abeta42 and increased Abeta38 production.
