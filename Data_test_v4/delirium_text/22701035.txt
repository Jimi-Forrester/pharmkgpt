22701035|t|The experience of delirium care and clinical feasibility of the CAM-ICU in a Korean ICU.
22701035|a|This study aimed to assess intensive care unit (ICU) nurses' experiences caring for delirious patients and the empirical evaluation of the clinical feasibility of the confusion assessment method (CAM) for ICU (CAM-ICU). In Korea, neither regular assessment of early-stage delirium nor preventive interventions are carried out properly in the ICU. This study was conducted using a qualitative research design with focus group interviews. Nurses received training about the CAM-ICU, and used it to assess surgical ICU patients for the presence of delirium during a 5-month period. None of the nurses had heard of the CAM-ICU before the study, and many complained that it was very challenging to use. One positive outcome of the CAM-ICU trial was that the clinical interest in delirium increased. The CAM-ICU could be used to facilitate communication once the instrument becomes well-known among health care professionals.
