35867354|a|INTRODUCTION: To determine the role of vitamin D intake on cognitive decline among Blacks and Whites. METHODS: Using data from the population-based Chicago Health and Aging Project, we studied 2061 Blacks and 1329 Whites with dietary vitamin D data and cognitive testing over 12 years of follow-up. Multivariable linear mixed-effects models were used to determine the association of vitamin D intake with cognitive decline. RESULTS: Vitamin D intake, particularly dietary vitamin D, was associated with a slower rate of decline in cognitive function among Blacks. In Blacks, comparing individuals in the lowest tertile of dietary intake, those in the highest tertile had a slower cognitive decline of 0.017 units/year (95% confidence interval 0.006, 0.027), independently of supplementation use. In Whites, vitamin D intake was not associated with cognitive decline. DISCUSSION: Dietary vitamin D may help to slow the decline in cognitive abilities among Blacks as they age.
