34823624|t|Normative Data for the CERAD-NP for Healthy High-Agers (80-84 years) and Effects of Age-Typical Visual Impairment and Hearing Loss.
34823624|a|OBJECTIVES: This study aims to establish reference data for nondemented adults between 80 and 84 years of age based on the German version of the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's disease Neuropsychological (CERAD-NP) test battery and to assess the possible influence of hearing and vision impairments on CERAD-NP performance. METHODS: Two hundred one volunteers were examined with the German CERAD-NP test battery, and 18 test scores were calculated from the data. The sample included 99 men (49%), the mean age was 81.8 years (SD = 1.3), and the mean years of education were 13.9 (SD = 3.1). Percentiles for continuous and percentile ranks for discrete test scores were calculated separately for four norm groups. The groups were classified according to gender and education. Multiple regression analysis was used to predict cognitive performance from visual acuity and hearing ability. RESULTS: The normative data obtained were consistent with other findings from younger and older age groups. Worse visual acuity predicted slower performance in the Trail Making Test (TMT). None of the other CERAD-NP tests were correlated to sensory functions. CONCLUSIONS: Using age-appropriate reference data, such as that established here for the 80-84 year age group can help to improve the detection of cognitive decline and prevent biases that arise when old-old adults are compared to younger old adults. Visual acuity should be considered an influencing factor on TMT performance.
