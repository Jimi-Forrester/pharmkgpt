38250722|a|Background: Measuring depth of anesthesia during intracerebral surgery is an important task to guarantee patient safety, especially while the patient is fixated in a Mayfield-clamp. Processed electro-encephalography measurements have been established to monitor deep sedation. However, visualizing nociception has not been possible until recently and has not been evaluated for the neurosurgical setting. In this single-center, retrospective observational analysis, we routinely collected the nociceptive data via a nociception level monitor (NOL ) of 40 patients undergoing intracerebral tumor resection and aimed to determine if this monitoring technique is feasible and delivers relevant values to potentially base therapeutic decisions on. Methods: Forty patients (age 56 +- 18 years) received total intravenous anesthesia and were non-invasively connected to the NOL  via a finger clip as well as a bispectral-index monitoring (BIS ) to confirm deep sedation. The measured nociception levels were retrospectively evaluated at specific time points of nociceptive stress (intubation, Mayfield-positioning, incision, extubation) and compared to standard vital signs. Results: Nociceptive measurements were successfully performed in 35 patients. The largest increase in nociceptive stimulation occurred during intubation (NOL  40 +- 16) followed by Mayfield positioning (NOL  39 +- 16) and incision (NOL  26 +- 12). Correlation with BIS measurements confirmed a sufficiently deep sedation during all analyzed time points (BIS 45 +- 13). Overall, patients showed an intraoperative NOL  score of 10 or less in 56% of total intervention time. Conclusions: Nociceptive monitoring using the NOL  system during intracerebral surgery is feasible and might yield helpful information to support therapeutic decisions. This could help to reduce hyperanalgesia, facilitating shorter emergence periods and less postoperative complications. Prospective clinical studies are needed to further examine the potential benefits of this monitoring approach in a neurosurgical context.
