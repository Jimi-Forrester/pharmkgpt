29614673|t|Findings from the Swedish Study on Familial Alzheimer's Disease Including the APP Swedish Double Mutation.
29614673|a|This is a brief summary of the findings from the Swedish study on familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD). Similar to other FAD studies, it includes prospective assessments of cognitive function, tissue sampling, and technical analyses such as MRI and PET. This 24-year-old study involves 69 individuals with a 50% risk of inheriting a disease-causing mutation in presenilin 1 (PSEN1 H163Y or I143T), or amyloid precursor protein (the Swedish APP or the arctic APP mutation) who have made a total of 169 visits. Our results show the extraordinary power in this study design to unravel the earliest changes in preclinical AD. The Swedish FAD study will continue and future research will focus on disentangling the order of pathological change using longitudinal data as well as modeling the changes in patient derived cell systems.
