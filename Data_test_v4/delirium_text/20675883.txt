20675883|t|[Development of new drugs for Alzheimer's disease].
20675883|a|Currently, only donepezil is available for the treatment of Alzheimer disease (AD) in Japan. Clinical trials of galantamine, rivastigmine, and memantine have been completed in Japan, and patients are awaiting government approval for the use of these drugs. The herbal medicine yokukansan was found to be effective for behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) in patients, and juzentaihoto was found to reduce AD pathology in a mouse model. In addition, muscarinic and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonists, serotonergic agonists, other drugs are being developed. These medicines have little effect on the improvement of cognitive functions. The anti-histamine dimebolin was expected to have a significant effect on the improvement of cognitive functions, but unfortunately, it was rejected during phase III clinical trials. Disease modifying drugs such as alpha-secretase activators, beta- and gamma-secretase inhibitors or modulators, inhibitors of Abeta and tau aggregation, enhancers of Abeta degradation, immunotherapies to remove Abeta oligomers and fibrils, and neurotrophic factors are being developed. Some of these drugs are in phase III clinical trials and are expected to be available for clinical use in the near future.
