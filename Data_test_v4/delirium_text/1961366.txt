1961366|t|Is the pattern of nerve cell loss in aging and Alzheimer's disease a real, or only an apparent, selectivity?
1961366|a|The pattern of neuronal loss from the brain in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is selective, not on the basis of neurotransmitter type, metabolic character or trophic dependence, but only in relationship to the anatomical connection of all affected cell types with the association cortex. The "selectivity" of the process of AD seems to lie with local factors within the cerebral cortex whose presence (or absence) links the processes that lead to the deposition of amyloid (A4) protein, to the neuritic response that results in the production and accumulation of abnormal tau proteins and which, ultimately, form the neurofibrillary tangle and bring about the demise of the neurone.
