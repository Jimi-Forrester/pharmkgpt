27555179|a|STUDY OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to test the hypothesis that premedication with a single dose of intranasal dexmedetomidine (DEX) could not only reduce preoperative anxiety but also minimize the emergence agitation in children undergoing cataract surgery with sevoflurane anesthesia. DESIGN: Single-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical comparison study. SETTING: Academic medical center. PATIENTS: Ninety American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status 1 and 2 children scheduled for cataract surgery. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized into 3 groups: group D1, group D2, and saline group (group C), in which the children received 1 or 2 mug/kg of intranasal DEX or saline, respectively, and each group comprises 30 patients. MEASUREMENTS: The mask induction score and the incidences of postoperative emergence agitation evaluated by the Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium scale were assessed. The emergence time, postanesthesia care unit (PACU) stay time, and any adverse events were recorded. MAIN RESULTS: The mask induction scores were significantly higher in the saline group than those in the D1 and D2 groups (P<.001). The incidences of emergence agitation in the D1 and D2 groups were significantly lower than that in the saline group (7/30 in group D1 and 3/30 in group D2 vs 24/30 in group C, P<.001). The emergence time and PACU stay time were comparable among the 3 groups (P>.05). The emergence time and PACU stay time did not differ significantly in DEX-treated groups as compared with the saline group; there were no differences between 1- and 2-mug/kg groups. None of the patients exhibited significant clinical complications. CONCLUSION: Intranasal DEX (1 or 2 mug/kg) dose independently improves the incidences of mask acceptance and prevents the incidences of postoperative emergency agitation mainly from sevoflurane without delaying the emergency time or inducing severe adverse events.
