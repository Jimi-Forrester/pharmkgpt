20171164|a|We previously indicated that amyloid beta (Abeta) augments protein levels of beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme-1 (BACE-1) through oxidative stress. In this study, we revealed that BACE-1 is involved in the cleavage of membrane-bound prostaglandin E2 synthase-2 (mPGES-2) in its N-terminal portion, which, in turn, enhanced the generation of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). PGE2 results in increased Abeta production, initiating a cell-injuring cycle. Using rat primary cortical neurons, a 48 h treatment with Abeta 1-42 (5 microM) resulted in the enhanced extracellular PGE2 levels up to about 1 ng/mL, which was attenuated by treatment with a BACE-1 inhibitor (200 nM). A synthetic peptide sequence of 20-amino acids that included the cleavage site of mPGES-2 (HTARWHL RAQDLHERS AAQLSLSS) was cleaved by recombinant BACE-1, confirmed using reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Cleaved or activated mPGES-2 augments the generation of PGE2. In addition, mPGES-2 was determined to be colocalized with BACE-1 and cyclooxygenase-2 in the perinuclear region in cells after exposure to Abeta. Exposure of neurons to PGE2 led to cell death, and Abeta production was enhanced by PGE2 (1 ng/mL, 48 h). Collectively, these results suggest that Abeta might cause neuroinflammation that aggravates Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis.
