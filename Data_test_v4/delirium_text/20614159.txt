20614159|a|Statins may exert beneficial effects on Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Based on the antineoplastic and apoptotic effects of statins in a number of cell types, we hypothesized that statins may be able to protect neurons by controlling the regulation of cell cycle and/or apoptosis. A growing body of evidence indicates that neurodegeneration involves the cell-cycle activation in postmitotic neurons. Failure of cell-cycle control is not restricted to neurons in AD patients, but occurs in peripheral cells as well. For these reasons, we studied the role of simvastatin (SIM) on cell survival/death in lymphoblasts from AD patients. We report here that SIM induces apoptosis in AD lymphoblasts deprived of serum. SIM interacts with PI3K/Akt and ERK1/2 signaling pathways thereby decreasing the serum withdrawal-enhanced levels of the CDK inhibitor p21(Cip1) (p21) and restoring the vulnerability of AD cells to trophic factor deprivation.
