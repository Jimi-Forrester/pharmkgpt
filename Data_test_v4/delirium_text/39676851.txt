39676851|t|Comparative Dosing of Adjunctive Corticosteroids Therapy for Pneumocystis Pneumonia with ARDS in Non-HIV Immunocompromised Patients.
39676851|a|Background: Adjuvant corticosteroids are effective in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) patients, but the effectiveness of adjuvant corticosteroids in non-HIV PCP remained controversial. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of standard-dose compared with low-dose steroids in non-HIV PCP patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Methods: This retrospective observational study included non-HIV PCP patients with ARDS admitted to the respiratory intensive care unit (RICU) of Beijing Chao-Yang Hospital from 2015 to 2022. Demographics, clinical characteristics, and outcomes were compared between patients receiving standard-dose and those receiving low-dose steroids. Survival times were assessed using Kaplan-Meier curves and compared with the Log rank test. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was conducted to identify independent risk factors for 28-day and 60-day mortality. Results: A total of 105 non-HIV PCP with ARDS were included, with 48 patients in the standard-dose steroid group (66.7% male, 50.5+-12.6 years) and 57 in the low-dose steroid group (61.4% male, 55.5+-14.2 years). The 60-day mortality was lower in the standard-dose group than in the low-dose group (63.2% vs 48.3%, p=0.04), while 28-day mortality showed no significant difference (50.8% vs 35.4%, p=0.11). After adjusting for confounders, standard-dose steroids reduced 28-day mortality (aHR: 0.339, 95% CI: 0.147-0.780) and 60-day mortality (aHR: 0.328, 95% CI: 0.152-0.709), particularly in patients aged <65 years, non-smokers, those requiring mechanical ventilation, with albumin<30 g/L, or a PaO2/FiO2 ratio <150 mmHg. No differences in co-infections or gastrointestinal bleeding were observed. Conclusion: The standard-dose steroid therapy significantly reduced 28-day and 60-day mortality without major complications in the non-HIV immunocompromised population with severe PCP with ARDS. These findings highlight the potential survival benefit of standard-dose corticosteroid regimen in this population.
