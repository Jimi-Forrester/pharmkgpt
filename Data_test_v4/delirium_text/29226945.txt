29226945|a|Most old adults receive their health care from their primary care practitioner; as a consequence, as the population ages, the manifestations and complications of cognitive impairment and dementia impose a growing burden on providers of primary care. Current guidelines do not recommend routine cognitive screening for older persons by primary care physicians, although the vast majority recommend a cognitive status assessment and neurological examination for subjects with a cognitive complaint. Also, no clinical practice guidelines recommend interventions in older adults with cognitive impairment in primary care settings. However, primary care physicians need to conduct a review of risks and protective factors associated with cognitive decline and organize interventions to improve or maintain cognitive function. Recent epidemiological studies have indicated numerous associations between lifestyle-related risk factors and incidental cognitive impairment. The development of biomarkers could also help in diagnosis, prognosis, selection for clinical trials, and objective assessment of therapeutic responses. Interventions aimed at cognitive impairment prevention should be pragmatic and easy to implement on a large scale in different health care systems, without generating high additional costs or burden on participants, medical and social care teams.
