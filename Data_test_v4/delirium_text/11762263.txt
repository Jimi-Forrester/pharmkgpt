11762263|a|Anxiety, agitation, delirium, and pain are common findings in the ICU. These unhealthy states may lead to increased irritability, discomfort, hypertension, tachycardia, cardiac ischemia, harmful motor activity, and psychologic disquiet for the patient. The appropriate treatment of these conditions may lead to decreased morbidity and mortality in the critically ill patient. Unfortunately, the management of anxiety, agitation, delirium, and pain in the intensive care unit is not ideal. Many patients interviewed after an ICU stay rate their pain control as poor and their memories of their stay as unpleasant. Furthermore, many caregivers lack sufficient understanding of the appropriate or indicated uses of drugs to allay patients' fears and pain. The use of suitable protocols for the proper titration of sedation of mechanically ventilated patients and monitoring of the level of sedation in ventilated patients may decrease the amount of time that patients are ventilated and may alleviate some of the emotional stresses of recall of painful procedures or uncomfortable mechanical ventilation. Future research into protocols for the care of the critically ill patient can enhance the overall well-being of these patients.
