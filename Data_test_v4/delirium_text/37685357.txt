37685357|t|Assessing the Efficacy of Inferior Vena Cava Collapsibility Index for Predicting Hypotension after Central Neuraxial Block: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
37685357|a|The use of ultrasonography to predict spinal-induced hypotension (SIH) has gained significant attention. This diagnostic meta-analysis aimed to investigate the reliability of the inferior vena cava collapsibility index (IVCCI) in predicting SIH in patients undergoing various surgeries. Databases, including Embase, Cochrane Library, Medline, and Google Scholar, were screened until 28 July 2023, yielding 12 studies with 1076 patients (age range: 25.6-79 years) undergoing cesarean section (CS) (n = 4) or non-CS surgeries (n = 8). Patients with SIH had a significantly higher IVCCI than those without SIH (mean difference: 11.12%, 95% confidence interval (CI): 7.83-14.41). The pooled incidence rate of SIH was 40.5%. IVCCI demonstrated satisfactory overall diagnostic reliability (sensitivity, 77%; specificity, 82%). The pooled area under the curve (AUC) was 0.85, indicating its high capability to differentiate patients at risk of PSH. The Fagan nomogram plot demonstrated a positive likelihood ratio (PLR) of 4 and a negative likelihood ratio (NLR) of 0.28. The results underscore the robustness and discriminative ability of IVCCI as a predictive tool for SIH. Nevertheless, future investigations should focus on assessing its applicability to high-risk patients and exploring the potential enhancement in patient safety through its incorporation into clinical practice.
