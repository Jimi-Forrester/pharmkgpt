39829851|t|Revealing hidden knowledge in amnestic mice.
39829851|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a form of dementia in which memory and cognitive decline is thought to arise from underlying neurodegeneration. These cognitive impairments, however, are transient when they first appear and can fluctuate across disease progression. Here, we investigate the neural mechanisms underlying fluctuations of performance in amnestic mice. We trained APP/PS1+ mice on an auditory go/no-go task that dissociated learning of task contingencies (knowledge) from its more variable expression under reinforcement (performance). APP/PS1+ exhibited significant performance deficits compared to control mice. Using large-scale two-photon imaging of 6,216 excitatory neurons in 8 mice, we found that auditory cortical networks were more suppressed, less selective to the sensory cues, and exhibited aberrant higher-order encoding of reward prediction compared to control mice. A small sub-population of neurons, however, displayed the opposite phenotype, reflecting a potential compensatory mechanism. Volumetric analysis demonstrated that deficits were concentrated near Abeta plaques. Strikingly, we found that these cortical deficits were reversed almost instantaneously on probe (non-reinforced) trials when APP/PS1+ performed as well as control mice, providing neural evidence for intact stimulus-action knowledge despite variable ongoing performance. A biologically-plausible reinforcement learning model recapitulated these results and showed that synaptic weights from sensory-to-decision neurons were preserved (i.e. intact stimulus-action knowledge) despite poor performance that was due to inadequate contextual scaling (i.e. impaired performance). Our results suggest that the amnestic phenotype is transient, contextual, and endogenously reversible, with the underlying neural circuits retaining the underlying stimulus-action associations. Thus, memory deficits commonly observed in amnestic mouse models, and potentially at early stages of dementia in humans, relate more to contextual drivers of performance rather than degeneration of the underlying memory traces.
