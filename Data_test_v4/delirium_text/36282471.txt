36282471|t|Phenylacetylglutamine as a novel biomarker of type 2 diabetes with distal symmetric polyneuropathy by metabolomics.
36282471|a|PURPOSE: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with distal symmetric polyneuropathy (DSPN) is a disease involving the nervous system caused by metabolic disorder, while the metabolic spectrum and key metabolites remain poorly defined. METHODS: Plasma samples of 30 healthy controls, 30 T2DM patients, and 60 DSPN patients were subjected to nontargeted metabolomics. Potential biomarkers of DSPN were screened based on univariate and multivariate statistical analyses, ROC curve analysis, and logistic regression. Finally, another 22 patients with T2DM who developed DSPN after follow-up were selected for validation of the new biomarker based on target metabolomics. RESULTS: Compared with the control group and the T2DM group, 6 metabolites showed differences in the DSPN group (P < 0.05; FDR < 0.1; VIP > 1) and a rising step trend was observed. Among them, phenylacetylglutamine (PAG) and sorbitol displayed an excellent discriminatory ability and associated with disease severity. The verification results demonstrated that when T2DM progressed to DSPN, the phenylacetylglutamine content increased significantly (P = 0.004). CONCLUSION: The discovered and verified endogenous metabolite PAG may be a novel potential biomarker of DSPN and involved in the disease pathogenesis.
