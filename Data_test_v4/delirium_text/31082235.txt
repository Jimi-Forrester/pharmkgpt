31082235|t|Exploring Amyloid-beta Dimer Structure Using Molecular Dynamics Simulations.
31082235|a|A major hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the aggregation of amyloid-beta peptides in the brains of people afflicted by the disease. The exact pathway to this catastrophic event is unknown. In this work, a total of 9.5 mus molecular dynamics simulations have been performed to investigate the structure and dynamics of the smallest form of toxic Abeta oligomers, i.e., the Abeta dimers. This study suggests that specific hydrophobic regions are vital in the aggregation process. Different possible structures for Abeta dimers are reported along with their relative binding affinity. These data may be used to design better Abeta-aggregation inhibitors. The diversity of the dimer structures suggests several aggregation pathways.
