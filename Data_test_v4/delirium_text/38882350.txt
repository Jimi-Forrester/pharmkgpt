38882350|t|Association between dysphagia risk and sleep quality in community-dwelling older adults: A cross-sectional study.
38882350|a|Objectives: Exploring the effects of swallowing function on sleep quality could provide valuable insights into the potential impact of reduced swallowing function on sleep. However, pertinent studies are limited. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the relationship between dysphagia risk and sleep health in community-dwelling older adults. Methods: Data for this cross-sectional study were obtained from the Shizuoka and Daiko studies conducted as part of the Japan Multi-Institutional Collaborative Cohort Study. Information on demographics, overall lifestyle, dysphagia risk, as well as sleep quality, duration, satisfaction, and regularity, was obtained using a self-administered questionnaire. Dysphagia risk and sleep quality were assessed using the Dysphagia Risk Assessment Questionnaire for the Community-dwelling Elderly and the Japanese version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Questionnaire Index, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression, adjusted for covariates, was employed to assess the association between dysphagia risk and sleep health. Results: Among the 3058 participants (1633 males, 1425 females) aged >=60 years, 28.0 % exhibited dysphagia risk, and 19.1 % reported poor sleep quality. Those with dysphagia risk were more likely to experience poor sleep quality than those without dysphagia risk. In male participants, dysphagia was significantly associated with poor sleep quality, unsatisfactory sleep, and sleep irregularity, but was not significantly associated with unsatisfactory or irregular sleep in female participants. The Japanese version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Questionnaire Index components-subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep disturbances, and daytime dysfunction-were associated with dysphagia risk in both sexes. Conclusions: Dysphagia risk is associated with sleep quality in older individuals in Japan. Thus, preserving swallowing function may contribute to enhancing sleep quality.
