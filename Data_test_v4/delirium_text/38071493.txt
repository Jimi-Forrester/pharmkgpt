38071493|a|AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether a low Braden Skin Score (BSS), reflecting an increased risk of pressure injury, could predict the risk of delirium in older patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). BACKGROUND: Delirium, a common acute encephalopathy syndrome in older ICU patients, is associated with prolonged hospital stay, long-term cognitive impairment and increased mortality. However, few studies have explored the relationship between BSS and delirium. DESIGN: Multicenter cohort study. METHODS: The study included 24,123 older adults from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database and 1090 older adults from the eICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD), all of whom had a record of BSS on admission to the ICU. We used structured query language to extract relevant data from the electronic health records. Delirium, the primary outcome, was primarily diagnosed by the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU or the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist. Logistic regression models were used to validate the association between BSS and outcome. A STROBE checklist was the reporting guide for this study. RESULTS: The median age within the MIMIC-IV and eICU-CRD databases was approximately 77 and 75 years, respectively, with 11,195 (46.4%) and 524 (48.1%) being female. The median BSS at enrollment in both databases was 15 (interquartile range: 13, 17). Multivariate logistic regression showed a negative association between BSS on ICU admission and the prevalence of delirium. Similar patterns were found in the eICU-CRD database. CONCLUSIONS: This study found a significant negative relationship between ICU admission BSS and the prevalence of delirium in older patients. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The BSS, which is simple and accessible, may reflect the health and frailty of older patients. It is recommended that BSS assessment be included as an essential component of delirium management strategies for older patients in the ICU. NO PATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: This is a retrospective cohort study, and no patients or the public were involved in the design and conduct of the study.
