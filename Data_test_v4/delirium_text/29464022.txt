29464022|t|Anticoagulants inhibit proteolytic clearance of plasma amyloid beta.
29464022|a|We recently discovered a plasma proteolysis pathway, termed the FXII-FVII pathway which is composed of coagulation proteases, and found it to be mainly responsible for the clearance of Abeta42 in the plasma in mice. Abeta42 and Abeta40 are the main Abeta forms in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the present study, in vitro assays, wild type (WT) mice and J20 mice (a transgenic AD model) are used to assess the degradation of Abeta40 and Abeta42 by the FXII-FVII pathway and the impact of anticoagulants on such degradation. Four clinically available and mechanistically distinct anticoagulants are evaluated, including dabigatran, enoxaparin (EP), rivaroxaban and warfarin. Each anticoagulant significantly elevates plasma level of synthetic Abeta42 in WT mice, among which EP is the most effective. The differential efficacies of the anticoagulants in elevating plasma Abeta42 level match closely with their inhibitory mechanisms towards the FXII-FVII pathway. Plasma Abeta40 is also degraded by the FXII-FVII pathway and is protected by EP. Moreover, the FXII-FVII pathway is significantly activated in J20 mice, but EP inhibits the activation and significantly elevates plasma levels of both Abeta40 and Abeta42. Taken together, our results shed new light on Abeta metabolism, reveal a novel function of anticoagulants, and suggest a novel approach to potentially developing plasma Abeta as an AD biomarker.
