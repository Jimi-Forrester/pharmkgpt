28775963|t|Dexmedetomidine: Current Role in Burn ICU.
28775963|a|Dexmedetomidine (DEX) is a relativelyrecent a2-adrenergic agonist which provides sedation, anxiolysis and analgesia with much less respiratory depression than other sedatives. These characteristics have implemented the use of the drug in the ICUs in order to achieve the target of a "arousable sedation", thanks to its significant manageability. Its sedative-analgesic properties are also particularly suitable for use in burn ICUs, both adult and pediatric, which is why the current Guidelines have recognized a central role in the management of these categories of patients. Finally, DEX has showed significant anti-inflammatory effect both in animal models and in preliminary clinical trials, reducing vasopressor requirements and main mediators levels of the systemic inflammatory response involved in sepsis and similar processes, suggesting its use for improved outcome in ICU septic patients.
