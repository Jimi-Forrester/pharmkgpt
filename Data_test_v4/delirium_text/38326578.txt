The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence and pattern of cognitive impairment (CI) among community-dwelling elderly in Egypt and the contribution of socioeconomic status to inequality in cognitive impairment. METHODS: A cross-sectional study involved 470 community-dwelling elderly aged 60 years or older living in Kafr El-Sheikh Governorate, Egypt. Subjects were recruited from home visits, geriatric clubs, and outpatient clinics. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment tools (MoCA & MoCA-B) were used to assess the prevalence of cognitive impairment, Hachinski ischemic score (HIS) to investigate the type of cognitive impairment, Ain Shams Cognitive Assessment (ASCA) tool to assess the pattern of specific cognitive domain affection, and an Egyptian socioeconomic status (SES) scale to classify the SES of the study participants. RESULTS: The prevalence of cognitive impairment was 50.2% distributed as 37.7% for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 12.5% for dementia. The most common type of cognitive impairment was the degenerative type (47.9%). Pattern of specific domain affection among cognitively impaired subjects ranged from 94% for visuospatial function to 12.7% for abstraction. Cognitive impairment was significantly higher with increasing age, female sex, marital status (single or widow), low education, higher number of comorbidities, and positive family history of cognitive impairment (p < 0.001). Also, cognitive impairment was concentrated mainly among participants with low socioeconomic score (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: In Egypt, cognitive impairment is significantly prevalent and concentrated among those who are in low socioeconomic status. Patients with mild CI were more than those with dementia, and the most common type of CI was the degenerative type. Increasing educational level of low SES population and improving their access to healthcare services are highly recommended to improve the inequity of cognitive impairment.
