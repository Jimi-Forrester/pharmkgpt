35794960|a|Acceleration of societal ageing has increased the global incidence of geriatric diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), and the demands for proper diagnosis and monitoring of those diseases are also increasing daily. We utilized diffracted X-ray blinking (DXB) for amyloid beta (Abeta) isoforms, which are thought to be closely related to AD, to discriminate among the dynamics of individual particles in early and long-term oligomerisation and aggregation inhibiting environments. Among the various Abeta isoforms, the dynamics of Abeta (1-42), which is known to be the most toxic form, were the slowest (the dynamics were lower by 78% com-pared with short-term incubation), and the dynamics were restored (the dynamics increased by 105% compared with normal aggregation) in an environment that suppressed oligomerisation of Abeta (1-42). It has been confirmed that the use of DXB allows measurements of dynamics related to the functional states of the target molecules.
