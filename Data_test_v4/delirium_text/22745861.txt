22745861|t|Correlation between Frailty Level and Adverse Health-related Outcomes of Community-Dwelling Elderly, One Year Retrospective Study.
22745861|a|BACKGROUND: Frailty is considered to be a clinical syndrome characterized by decreased physiological reserves associated with a greater risk of health-related problems, hospitalization, and death. The current study examined hospitalization, falls, cognitive decline and disability between robust, prefrail and frail elderly in one year. METHODS: 110 participants aged 65 or more who visited two senior welfare centers in Seoul from February 2008 to June 2008 were surveyed again from March 2009 to June 2009 with demographic characteristics, number of chronic diseases and medication, study of osteoporotic fractures (SOF) frailty index, instrumental activity of daily living (IADL), depression, mini-mental state examination-Korean version (MMSE-K), falling history and admission history within one year. These results were compared with participants' previous survey done one year ago. RESULTS: Among total 110 subjects, 48 (44%) robust, 30 (27%) prefrail, and 32 (29%) frail subjects changed to 26 (24%), 54 (49%), and 30 (27%) respectively over the year. There were statistical significances in age, number of chronic disease, depressive mood, MMSE, falls, hospitalization, IADL disability contributing to frailty (P < 0.05). Frailty defined by SOF frailty index was associated with greater risk of adverse outcomes. Frail subjects had a higher age-adjusted risk of cognitive function decline (odds ratio [OR], 3.57), disability (OR, 9.64), fall (OR, 5.42), and hospitalization (OR, 4.45; P < 0.005). CONCLUSION: The frailty index like SOF frailty index might predict risk of falls, disability, hospitalization, and cognitive decline in the elderly, emphasizing special attention to the individuals showing frailty in outpatient examination.
