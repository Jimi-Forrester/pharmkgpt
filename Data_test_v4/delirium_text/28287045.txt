28287045|a|PURPOSE: This study assessed the effects of an intervention program, which combined the use of a walker with assistive technology, on the ambulation and indices of positive involvement of persons with advanced Alzheimer's disease. A social validation assessment of the program was also carried out. METHOD: The study included 10 participants with moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease and inability to walk independently. During baseline, the participants sat in their chair or were provided with a walker. During the intervention, the participants were provided with the walker and assistive technology, which delivered (a) preferred stimulation contingent on step responses and (b) encouragements to ambulate if needed. RESULTS: The participants' mean step frequencies were between 17 and 45 per session during the baseline and between 83 and 127 per session during the intervention. Sessions lasted 3 min. Most participants also had an increase in indices of positive involvement during the intervention sessions, thus showing an interest in those sessions. The social validation assessment showed that staff personnel rated the program favorably. CONCLUSIONS: A program combining the use of a walker with assistive technology may be a practical resource for improving ambulation and positive involvement of persons with advanced Alzheimer's disease. Implications for rehabilitation A program based on relatively simple technology combined to a walker device may support ambulation in participants with advanced Alzheimer's disease who are no longer able to walk independently. The same program may also help increase the indices of positive involvement (i.e., improve the general attention/activity and mood) of most participants. The staff's positive ratings of the program suggest that there may be a favorable attitude toward the acceptance and application of the program in daily contexts.
