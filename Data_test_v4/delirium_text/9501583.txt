9501583|a|The main points of a workshop on the place of clinical trials in the memory clinics in France are reproduced schematically. The efficiency of these centres has been tested at the time of the numerous clinical trials performed in France on Alzheimer's disease. In parallel, several difficulties have been pointed out: inhomogeneity of the technical approaches, official role of psychologists in the hospital teams, integration of clinical research to individual care. A particular effort should be oriented towards specific research on the different types of dementia, on early stages, on information for both media and authorities as well as on specific technical and methodological problems.
