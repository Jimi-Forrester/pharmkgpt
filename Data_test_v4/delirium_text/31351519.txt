31351519|a|OBJECTIVE: To review the evidence on the effectiveness of specific occupational therapy programs in elderly people hospitalized for acute medical pathology. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Relevant randomized clinical trials were selected by searching the main bibliographic databases to evaluate the effectiveness of in-hospital occupational therapy interventions for people aged 65 years and over who were hospitalized for acute medical pathology. RESULTS: Six studies were finally selected. The interventions consisted of individualized programs of occupational therapy: training and re-education in the activities of daily living (ADL); evaluation, prescription and training in the use of support devices; and providing reports regarding recommendations and referrals on discharge. In five studies, the patients in the intervention group obtained higher scores on assessment tools used to measure functionality in ADL. In one of the studies there was a statistically significant reduction in delirium, as well as an improvement in cognitive function. There was no evidence for the effectiveness of occupational therapy interventions for anxiety, fear and/or perceived safety, in any of the studies analyzed. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence is limited as to whether specific occupational therapy programs are effective in improving functionality in ADL in this group of patients. However, occupational therapy was significantly effective in reducing delirium and improving cognitive function. There is insufficient evidence to claim that specific occupational therapy programs are effective in reducing levels of anxiety, increasing perceived quality of life, reducing readmission rates, or reducing the length of hospital stay.
