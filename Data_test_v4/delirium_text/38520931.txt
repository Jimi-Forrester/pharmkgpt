38520931|a|Electrochemiluminescence (ECL) biosensors provide a convenient and high sensitivity method for early disease diagnosis. However, creating luminophore arrays relying on powerful ECL signals remains a daunting task. Porphyrin-centered metal organic frameworks (MOFs) exhibit remarkable potential in ECL sensing applications. In this paper, based on a simple one-pot synthesis method, PCN-222@Ag NPs doped with CeO2 was synthesized to enhance the ECL performance. Due to the strong catalytic ability of CeO2, the ECL signal strength of the new material PCN-222@CeO2@Ag NPs is much higher than that of the PCN-222@Ag NPs and PCN-222. The luminous properties of PCN-222@CeO2@Ag NPs become more intense and stable due to the excellent electronic conductivity of Ag NPs. Based on the fact that CuS@PDA composite can quench the ECL signal of PCN-222@CeO2@Ag NPs, we constructed a novel sandwich ECL immune sensor for the detection of phosphorylated Tau 181 (p-Tau-181) protein. The ECL sensor has a great linear relationship with p-Tau-181 protein concentration, ranging from 1 pg/mL to 100 ng/mL. The detection limit is as low as 0.147 pg/mL. This work provides new ideas for developing sensitive ECL sensors for the p-Tau-181 protein, the marker of Alzheimer's disease.
