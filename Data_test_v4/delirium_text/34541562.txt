34541562|t|Don't forget me in amidst of COVID-19 pandemic: A case series and review of literature on steroid associated psychiatric manifestations.
34541562|a|There is a sudden upsurge in the use of steroids due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, especially in patients with severe or critical COVID-19 infection. There are reports of excessive use of steroids, both in terms of use in patients who do not require the same and use in doses higher than the recommended. There are reports of the emergence of different adverse outcomes of excessive steroid use in the form of diabetes mellitus and a higher incidence of mucormycosis. However, little attention has been paid to the mental health impact of the use of steroids. This review attempts to evaluate the existing data in terms of incidence of psychiatric side effects of steroids, and the risk factors for steroid associated psychiatric manifestations. Additionally, an attempt is made to discuss the pathogenesis of steroid-associated psychiatric side effects and why it is likely that the incidence of psychiatric side effects may be more in patients with COVID-19 infection. There is a need to improve the awareness about the psychiatric side effects of steroids, both among the physicians and mental health professionals, as in any patient presenting with new-onset psychiatric symptoms while having COVID-19 infection or during the post-COVID-19 infection phase, a possibility of steroid associated side effect needs to be considered.
