19595894|a|The fourth Annual Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) Symposium, held at the Eden Roc Hotel in Miami Beach Florida on February 24 and 25, 2006, brought together some 150 neuropsychologists, neurologists, and other specialists in the field to discuss the latest research on issues related to the diagnosis and progression of MCI across the broad range of cognitive and functional impairments that comprise its various subtypes. Four mini-symposia were convened on the topics of Cognitive Reserve and MCI, the Genetics and Proteomics of Cognitive Decline, Pathogenesis of Vascular/Metabolic Cognitive Impairment, and Systemic and Psychiatric Considerations in MCI. In addition, 2 keynote addresses were delivered; one on the Rotterdam Study and the other a review of clinical trials in MCI. Participants in the symposium also discussed whether the time has come to revise current diagnostic criteria for Alzheimer's disease.
