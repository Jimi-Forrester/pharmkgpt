35516383|t|Fluorescent probe for Cu2+ and the secondary application of the resultant complex to detect cysteine.
35516383|a|A special fluorescent probe has been developed, one that demonstrated excellent "off-on-type" change in fluorescence with high selectivity toward Cu2+. Interestingly, the probe-Cu2+ complex could detect cysteine due to the ability of this amino acid to strongly coordinate Cu2+, and no obvious interference was observed from other amino acids and anions. According to the proposed mechanism, addition of cysteine induced decomplexation of the probe-Cu2+ form. Furthermore, the results of confocal microscopy experiments demonstrated the potential of using the probe to image Cu2+ in living cells and mice.
