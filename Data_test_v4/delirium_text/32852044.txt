32852044|t|Prevention of Delirium in Older Adults With Dementia: A Systematic Literature Review.
32852044|a|Although dementia is the largest independent risk factor for delirium and leads to poor health outcomes, we know little about how to prevent delirium in persons with dementia (PWD). The purpose of the current systematic literature review was to identify interventions designed to prevent delirium in older PWD. Seven studies meeting inclusion criteria were extracted. Five studies were in the acute care setting and two were community settings. One study used a randomized controlled trial design. Five of the seven interventions comprised multiple components addressing delirium risk factors, including education. Two studies addressed delirium by administration of medication or vitamin supplementation. Using the GRADE framework for the evaluation of study quality, we scored three studies as moderate and four studies as low. Thus, high-quality research studies to guide how best to prevent delirium in PWD are lacking. Although more research is required, the current review suggests that multicomponent approaches addressing delirium risk factors should be considered by health care professionals when supporting older PWD.
