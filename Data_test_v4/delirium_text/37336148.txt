METHODS: The effects of catalpol on Abeta formation were investigated by thioflavin T assay. The effect of catalpol on generating inflammatory cytokines from microglial cells and the cytotoxicity of microglial cells on HT22 hippocampal cells were assessed by real-time quantitative PCR, ELISA, redox reactions, and cell viability. APPswe/PS1DeltaE9 mice were treated with catalpol, and their cognitive ability was investigated using the water maze and novel object recognition tests. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence were used to probe for protein markers of microglia and astrocyte, Abeta deposits, and NF-kappaB pathway activity. Abeta peptides, neuroinflammation, and nitric oxide production were examined using ELISA and redox reactions. RESULTS: Catalpol potently inhibited Abeta fibril and oligomer formation. In microglial cells stimulated by Abeta, catalpol alleviated the expression of the proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin (IL)-6, and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) but promoted the expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Catalpol alleviated the cytotoxic effects of Abeta-exposed microglia on HT22 cells. Treatment with catalpol in APPswe/PS1DeltaE9 mice downregulated neuroinflammation production, decreased Abeta deposits in the brains and alleviated cognitive impairment. Catalpol treatment decreased the number of IBA-positive microglia and GFAP-positive astrocytes and their activities of the NF-kappaB pathway in the hippocampus of APPswe/PS1DeltaE9 mice. CONCLUSION: The administration of catalpol protected neurons by preventing neuroinflammation and Abeta deposits in an AD mouse model. Therefore, catalpol may be a promising strategy for treating AD.
