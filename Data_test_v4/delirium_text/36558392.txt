36558392|t|A Magtein , Magnesium L-Threonate, -Based Formula Improves Brain Cognitive Functions in Healthy Chinese Adults.
36558392|a|Magnesium is one of the most abundant essential minerals in the body. Magnesium supplements mostly have low bioavailability, except magnesium L-threonate. In 2010, a novel magnesium compound, magnesium L-threonate (Magtein ) was identified and was shown to raise the magnesium levels in the brain and neurons effectively. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled study, Magtein PS, a magnesium L-threonate (Magtein )- and phosphatidylserine-based formulation additionally containing vitamins C and D, was tested for its cognitive benefits in 109 healthy Chinese adults aged 18-65 years. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive either Magtein PS or placebo (starch) capsules, at a dose of 2 g/day. "The Clinical Memory Test", the standard test commonly used in Chinese hospitals and academic institutes for cognitive evaluation, was administered before and 30 days after subjects received the supplement. Subjects receiving Magtein PS showed significant improvements over the control group in all five subcategories of "The Clinical Memory Test" as well as the overall memory quotient scores. The older participants showed more improvement than younger participants. Results indicated significant benefits of Magtein PS in improving memory and cognition in healthy Chinese adults.
