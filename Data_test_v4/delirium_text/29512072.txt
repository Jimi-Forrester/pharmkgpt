29512072|t|Neuroimaging Methods for MRI Analysis in CSF Biomarkers Studies.
29512072|a|Among others, the existence of pathophysiological biomarkers such as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Abeta-42, t-tau, and p-tau preceding the onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD) symptomatology have shifted the conceptualization of AD as a continuum. In addition, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) enables the study of structural and functional cross-sectional correlates and longitudinal changes in vivo and, therefore, the combination of CSF data and imaging analyses emerges as a synergistic approach to understand the structural correlates related with specific AD-related biomarkers. In this chapter, we describe the methods used in neuroimaging that will allow researchers to combine data on CSF metabolites with imaging analyses.
