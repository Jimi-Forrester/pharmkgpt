38289666|t|Evaluating the Impact of Virtual Reality on the Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia and Quality of Life of Inpatients With Dementia in Acute Care: Randomized Controlled Trial (VRCT).
38289666|a|BACKGROUND: Virtual reality (VR) is increasingly considered a valuable therapeutic tool for people with dementia. However, rigorous studies are still needed to evaluate its impact on behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSDs) and quality of life (QoL) across care settings. OBJECTIVE: The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of VR therapy on managing BPSDs, falls, length of stay, and QoL in inpatients with dementia admitted to an acute care hospital. The secondary aim was to evaluate the intervention's feasibility in terms of acceptability, safety, and patient experience. METHODS: A prospective, open-label, mixed methods, randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted between April 2019 and March 2020. A total of 69 participants (aged >=65 years with a diagnosis of dementia and who did not meet the exclusion criteria) were randomly assigned to either the control (n=35, 51%) or VR (n=34, 49%) arm. Participants in the experimental (VR) arm were visited by a researcher and watched 360  VR films on a head-mounted display for up to 20 minutes every 1 to 3 days, whereas individuals in the control arm received standard of care. Instances of daily BPSDs and falls were collected from nurses' daily notes. QoL was measured through semistructured interviews and the Quality of Life in Late-Stage Dementia scale. Structured observations and semistructured interviews were used to measure treatment feasibility. The primary outcomes were analyzed at a 95% significance level based on the intention-to-treat method. RESULTS: VR therapy had a statistically significant effect on reducing aggressiveness (ie, physical aggression and loud vociferation; P=.01). Substantial impact of VR therapy was not found for other BPSDs (eg, apathy), falls, length of stay, or QoL as measured using the Quality of Life in Late-Stage Dementia scale. The average VR therapy session lasted 6.8 (SD 6.6; range 0-20) minutes, and the intervention was overall an acceptable and enjoyable experience for participants. No adverse events occurred as a result of VR therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Immersive VR therapy appears to have an effect on aggressive behaviors in patients with dementia in acute care. Although the randomized controlled trial was stopped before reaching the intended sample size owing to COVID-19 restrictions, trends in the results are promising. We suggest conducting future trials with larger samples and, in some cases, more sensitive data collection instruments.
