27734278|t|Inappropriate Prescription and Renal Function Among Older Patients with Cognitive Impairment.
27734278|a|BACKGROUND: Older people are more sensitive to drugs and adverse drug reactions than younger people because of age-related physiological changes such as impaired renal function. As people with dementia are particularly vulnerable to the effects of drugs, it is especially important to evaluate the dosages of renally cleared medications in this group. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of impaired renal function and inappropriate prescriptions on the basis of renal function among older patients with dementia or cognitive impairment. METHODS: The medical records of 428 patients aged >=65 years who were admitted to two hospitals in northern Sweden were reviewed and renally cleared medications were identified. The Cockcroft-Gault equation was used to evaluate renal function. Doses were evaluated according to the Geriatric Dosage Handbook. RESULTS: Renal function was impaired (estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 ml/min) in 65.4 % of the study population. Impaired renal function was associated with increasing age. Among 547 prescriptions identified as renally cleared medications, 9.1 % were inappropriate based on the patient's renal function; 13.5 % of the 326 patients prescribed renally cleared medications had inappropriate prescriptions. Inappropriate prescriptions were more common among patients living in nursing homes. CONCLUSIONS: Impaired renal function is common and inappropriate prescription is prevalent among old people with cognitive impairment in northern Sweden. Continuous consideration of renal function is important when prescribing medications to this group.
