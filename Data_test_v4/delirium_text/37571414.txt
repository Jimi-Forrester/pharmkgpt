37571414|t|25(OH)D Concentration in Neonates, Infants, Toddlers, Older Children and Teenagers from Poland-Evaluation of Trends during Years 2014-2019.
37571414|a|INTRODUCTION: Local and international guidelines have provided schedules for the vitamin D supplementation of general populations of different ages, including children. Our study aimed to assess 25(OH)D concentration and its potential change during a growth and maturation period, adding parameters that reflect the risk of hypercalcemia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The available 25(OH)D concentration values (n = 17,636; 7.8 +- 6.0 years), calcium (n = 2673; 16.3 +- 6.1 years) and phosphate (n = 2830; 3.8 +- 5.2 years) metabolism markers were analyzed in a studied group of patients (0-18 years). RESULTS: In the studied group the mean 25(OH)D concentration was 29.4 +- 11.7 ng/mL. Concentrations of 25(OH)D < 10 ng/mL were observed in 1.7% of patients (n = 292), 10-20 ng/mL in 17.2% (n = 3039), 20-30 ng/mL in 39.5% (n = 6960) and 30-50 ng/mL in 37.2% (n = 6567). In patients with a 25(OH)D concentration <10 ng/mL, normal calcemia (2.25-2.65 mmol/L) was observed in 29.5% of cases (n = 86). Three patients had 25(OH)D concentrations above 100 ng/mL with co-existing hypercalcemia; the mean was Ca = 3.40 mmol/L. Hypocalcemia (Ca < 2.25 mmol/L) was observed in 10,4% of patients (n = 2797). Furthermore, 5.0% of patients showed an increased calcium concentration >2.65 mmol/L (n = 1327). The highest mean 25(OH)D concentration of 32.1 ng/mL +- 12.9 was noted in the years 2018-2019 (n = 3931) and the lowest in the year 2015 (27.2 ng/mL +- 11.0; n = 2822). CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D deficiency (<20 ng/mL) was noted in 18,9% of subjects in the years 2014-2019. An effective prevention of vitamin D deficiency was observed in children aged 3 years and younger. A relationship between the concentrations of calcium and 25(OH)D was not observed.
