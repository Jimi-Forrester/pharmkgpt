35686006|a|Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta9-THC) is mainly a psychoactive compound in the cannabis plant. The immunoassay, an alternative method to HPLC and GC, can be used to analyze and measure Delta9-THC. This method provides high sensitivity and specificity by using antibodies specific to the desired substances. Currently, plants provide several benefits over traditional expression platforms to produce recombinant antibodies, such as lower production costs and scalability. Therefore, this study aims to produce a recombinant anti-Delta9-THC monoclonal antibody (mAb) with transient expression using N. benthamiana. The highest expression level of the plant-produced mAb was estimated to be 0.33 ug/g leaf fresh weight. Our results demonstrate that the antibody provided in vitro affinity binding related to Delta9-THC and the metabolites of Delta9-THC, such as cannabinol (CBN). Moreover, the antibody also showed binding efficiency with Delta9-THC in cannabis extract. Moreover, plant-produced mAbs provide efficiency against Delta9-THC and can be applied for further immunoassay applications.
