30526652|a|BACKGROUND: The quantification of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides in blood plasma as potential biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is hampered by very low Abeta concentrations and the presence of matrix components that may interfere with the measurements. METHODS: We developed a two-step immunoassay for the simultaneous measurement of the relative levels of Abeta38, Abeta40 and Abeta42 in human EDTA plasma. The assay was employed for the study of 23 patients with dementia of the Alzheimer's type (AD-D) and 17 patients with dementia due to other reasons (OD). We examined relationships with the clinical diagnosis, cerebral Abeta load as quantified by amyloid-positron emission tomography, apolipoprotein E genotype, Abeta levels and Tau protein in cerebrospinal fluid. RESULTS: Preconcentration of plasma Abeta peptides by immunoprecipitation substantially facilitated their immunological measurements. The Abeta42/Abeta40 and Abeta42/Abeta38 ratios were statistically significantly lower in the AD-D patients than in the OD group. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves reached 0.87 for the Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio and 0.80 for the Abeta42/Abeta38 ratio. CONCLUSIONS: The measurement of plasma Abeta peptides with an immunological assay can be improved by preconcentration via immunoprecipitation with an antibody against the Abeta amino-terminus and elution of the captured peptides by heating in a mild detergent-containing buffer. Our findings support the Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio in blood plasma as a promising AD biomarker candidate which correlates significantly with the validated core biomarkers of AD. Further studies will be needed for technical advancement of the assay and validation of the biomarker findings.
