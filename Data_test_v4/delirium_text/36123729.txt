36123729|t|Review of potential medical treatments for middle ear cholesteatoma.
36123729|a|Middle ear cholesteatoma (MEC), is a destructive, and locally invasive lesion in the middle ear driven by inflammation with an annual incidence of 10 per 100,000. Surgical extraction/excision remains the only treatment strategy available and recurrence is high (up to 40%), therefore developing the first pharmaceutical treatments for MEC is desperately required. This review was targeted at connecting the dysregulated inflammatory network of MEC to pathogenesis and identification of pharmaceutical targets. We summarized the numerous basic research endeavors undertaken over the last 30+ years to identify the key targets in the dysregulated inflammatory pathways and judged the level of evidence for a given target if it was generated by in vitro, in vivo or clinical experiments. MEC pathogenesis was found to be connected to cytokines characteristic for Th1, Th17 and M1 cells. In addition, we found that the inflammation created damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), which further promoted inflammation. Similar positive feedback loops have already been described for other Th1/Th17 driven inflammatory diseases (arthritis, Crohn's disease or multiple sclerosis). A wide-ranging search for molecular targeted therapies (MTT) led to the discovery of over a hundred clinically approved drugs already applied in precision medicine. Based on exclusion criteria designed to enable fast translation as well as efficacy, we condensed the numerous MTTs down to 13 top drugs. The review should serve as groundwork for the primary goal, which is to provide potential pharmaceutical therapies to MEC patients for the first time in history. Video Abstract.
