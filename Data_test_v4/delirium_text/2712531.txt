2712531|a|We have prospectively followed over a 5-year period 434 volunteers who were at intake ambulatory, functional, presumably nondemented, and between 75 and 85 years of age. Fifty-six (an incidence of 3.53 per 100 person-years at risk) developed a progressive dementia: 32 met diagnostic criteria for Alzheimer's disease (AD) (an incidence of 2.0 per 100 person-years at risk), 15 had vascular or mixed dementia, and 9 had other disorders or remain undiagnosed. New cases of dementia were as common as myocardial infarction and twice as common as stroke. Risk factors for both dementia and AD were age (over 80) and gender (female); other reported risk factors such as family history, prior head injury, thyroid disease, maternal age, and smoking were not risk factors for AD in this elderly cohort. Prior stroke was the major risk factor for vascular or mixed dementia; diabetes and left ventricular hypertrophy but not a history of hypertension per se were also risk factors for vascular dementia. The major predictor of the development of AD was the mental status score on entry. The 58.5% of the cohort who made zero to two errors on a 33-item mental status test had a less than 0.6% per year chance of developing AD, whereas the 16% of the cohort with five to eight errors on this test developed AD at a rate of over 12% per year. Thus, it is possible to identify a large cohort of 80-year-olds who are at low risk for AD and a smaller cohort at very high risk.
