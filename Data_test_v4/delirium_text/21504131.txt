21504131|t|Conversion of elderly to Alzheimer's dementia: role of confluence of hypothermia and senescent stigmata--the plausible pathway.
21504131|a|Aging is a consequence of progressive decline in special and somatosensory functions and specific brain stem nuclei. Many senescent stigmata, including hypoxia, hypoxemia, depressed cerebral blood flow and glucose metabolism, diseases of senescence, and their medications all enhance hypothermia as do alcohol, cold environment, and malnutrition. Hypothermia is a critical factor having deleterious impact on brain stem and neocortical functions. Additionally, anesthesia in elderly also promotes hypothermia; anesthetics not only cause consciousness (sensory and motor) changes, but memory impairment as well. Anesthesia inhibits cholinergic pathways, reticular and thalamocortical systems, cortico-cortical connectivity, and causes post-operative delirium and cognitive dysfunction. Increasing evidence indicates that anesthetic exposures may contribute to dementia onset and Alzheimer's disease (AD) in hypothermic elderly. Inhaled anesthetics potentiate caspases, BACE, tau hyperphosphorylation, and apoptosis. This paper addresses the important question: "Why do only some elderly fall victim to AD"? Based on information on the pathogenesis of early stages of cognitive dysfunction in elderly (i.e., due to senescent stigmata), and the effects of anesthesia superimposed, a detailed plausible neuropathological substrate (mechanism/pathway) is delineated here that reveals the possible cause(s) of AD. Basically, it encompasses several risk factors for cognitive dysfunction during senescence plus several hypothermia-enhancing routes; they all converge and tip the balance towards dementia onset. This knowledge of the confluence of heterogeneous risk factors in perpetuating dementia relentlessly is of importance in order to: (a) avoid their convergence; (b) take measures to stop/reverse cognitive dysfunction; and (c) to develop therapeutic strategies to enhance cognitive function and attenuate AD.
