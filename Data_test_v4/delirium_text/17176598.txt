17176598|a|The aim of the study was to reveal risk factors for development of alcoholic psychosis in patients with eating disorders. Ten inpatients with anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa abusing alcohol for 1-4 years have been examined. Delirium tremens was diagnosed in 5 patients in the first few days of staying in the hospital, other 5 patients were included in the control group. Factors precipitating delirium tremens were low body mass index, water-electrolytic imbalance, severe dehydration caused by vomiting and hypoglycemia. A careful choice of doses of psychotropic drugs taking into account concomitant somatic-endocrine disturbances, the degree of electrolytic imbalance and thorough alcoholic anamnesis is important at the earlier stage of treatment.
