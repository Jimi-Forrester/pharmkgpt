20541853|a|The following article presents the main points of the follow-up plan of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related syndromes patients. The general objective of this follow-up plan is to improve the quality of live of these subjects and their family. The key points are assessments of cognitive decline, functional decline and complications such as behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), malnutrition and gait and balance disorders. In clinical practice, different tools are available, but frequency of evaluation is not consensual. However, the aim of this follow-up is to detect, prevent and treat complications and to improve the use of residual functional abilities in basic activities of daily living. The physician also needs to detect and prevent caregiver's exhaustion and to consider the ethical issues raised by the disease. The care plan is based on non pharmacological and pharmacological measures. The non pharmacological approach must be implemented first. The place of anti-dementia drugs is considered. Lastly, this follow-up plan aims to limit iterative admissions to emergency room and to increase the access to geriatric units. Communication and collaboration between specialist, family practitioner and caregivers are needed in order to reach the objective of quality of life improvement in AD patients.
