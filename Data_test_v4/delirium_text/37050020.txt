37050020|t|Synthesis and Elimination Pathways of 1-Methanesulfonyl-1,2-dihydroquinoline Sulfonamides.
37050020|a|A series of new Morita-Baylis-Hillman acetates were prepared and reacted with methanesulfonamide (K2CO3, DMF, 23  C) to produce tertiary dihydroquinoline sulfonamides in high yields. Subsequent efforts to eliminate the methylsulfonyl group from these derivatives (K2CO3, DMF, 90  C) as a route to quinolines were met with mixed results. Although dihydroquinoline sulfonamides prepared from ethyl acrylate and acrylonitrile generally underwent elimination to give excellent yields of quinolines, those generated from 3-buten-2-one failed to undergo elimination and instead decomposed. The failure of these ketone substrates to aromatize presumably derives from the enolizable methyl ketone at C-3. Finally, the attempted aromatization of the acrylate-derived 6,7-difluoro-1,2-dihydroquinoline sulfonamide demonstrated that other interesting processes could occur in preference to the desired elimination.
