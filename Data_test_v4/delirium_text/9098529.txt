9098529|a|Fourteen days after hippocampal microinfusion with colchicine (COL), learning and memory ability of mice was significantly impaired, while glutamate (Glu), gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), Glu/GABAB and GABAB receptor levels in the cortex and/or the hippocampus were significantly changed. After treatment with a GABAB receptor antagonist, CGP36742, learning and memory impairment caused by COL could be significantly improved, and the above indices in brain regions reversed. These results suggest GABAB antagonists may have therapeutic value in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
