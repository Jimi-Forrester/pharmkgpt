39476996|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD), characterized by severe and progressive cognitive decline, stands as one of the most prevalent and devastating forms of dementia. Based on our recent findings showing intermittent hypoxic conditioning improved neuronal function in patients with mild cognitive impairment, the present study aimed at investigating whether the neuroprotective effects of intermittent hypoxia can be replicated in a rat model of AD, which allows us to explore the underlying cellular mechanisms involving neuroinflammation, hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha (HIF1alpha), and cytochrome P450 family 2 subfamily E member 1 (CYP2E1). Forty-one adult male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to three groups: 1) Control group: received intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of saline; 2) STZ group: received ICV injection of streptozotocin (STZ) to induce AD-like pathology; and 3) STZ + IHHT group received ICV injection of STZ as well as 15 daily sessions of intermittent hypoxia-hyperoxia training (IHHT). We observed that ICV injection of STZ inhibited spatial learning and memory in the rats assessed with Morris Water Maze test. The cognitive function declines were accompanied by increased expression of amyloid beta peptide (Abeta), HIF1alpha, CYP2E1, and TNFalpha in hippocampus. Interestingly, IHHT significantly restored the STZ-induced cognitive dysfunction, while reduced expression of Abeta, CYP2E1, HIF1alpha and TNFalpha. We conclude that IHHT with mild hypoxia-hyperoxia can enhance spatial learning and memory and reduce the AD-like pathologic changes in rats. The neuroprotective outcome of IHHT may be related to anti-inflammatory effects in hippocampus.
