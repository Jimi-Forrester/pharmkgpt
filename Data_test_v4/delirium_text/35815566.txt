35815566|a|In order to find molecules of natural origin with potential biological activities, we isolate and synthesise compounds with agarofuran skeletons (epoxyeudesmanes). From the seeds of Maytenus disticha and Maytenus magellanica we obtained six dihydro-beta-agarofurans, and by means of the Robinson annulation reaction we synthesised five compounds with the same skeleton. The structures were established on the basis of NMR, IR, and MS. The evaluated compounds showed inhibitory activity on the acetylcholinesterase enzyme and on the COX enzymes. Compound 4 emerged as the most potent in the acetylcholinesterase inhibition assay with IC50 17.0 +- 0.016 microM on acetylcholinesterase (AChE). The compounds evaluated were shown to be selective for AChE. The molecular docking, and the propidium displacement assay suggested that the compounds do not bind to the active site of the enzyme AChE, but rather bind to the peripheral anionic site (PAS) of the enzyme, on the other hand, the natural compound 8, showed the best inhibitory activity on the COX-2 enzyme with an IC50 value of 0.04 +- 0.007 microM. The pharmacokinetic profile calculated in silico using the SWISSADME platform shows that these molecules could be considered as potential drugs for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as AD.
