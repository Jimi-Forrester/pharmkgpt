32706196|t|The silent information regulator 1 pathway attenuates ROS-induced oxidative stress in Alzheimer's disease.
32706196|a|We show that down-regulation of circular ribonucleic acid 0001588 with small interfering-circular ribonucleic acid 0001588 mimics promoted caspase-3 and caspase-9 activity levels, increased lactate dehydrogenase activity levels, and reduced cell growth of in vitro model. Circular ribonucleic acid 0001588 plasmids increased circular ribonucleic acid 0001588 expressions and promoted cell growth and reduced activity levels of lactate dehydrogenase, caspase-3, and caspase-9 activity levels in vitro model of Alzheimer's disease. Then, circular ribonucleic acid 0001588 down-regulation also promoted reactive oxygen species production and oxidative stress (malonaldehyde), and reduced superoxide dismutase, glutathione, and glutathione peroxidase levels by suppressing of silent information regulator 1/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2/heme oxygenase-1 in vitro. However, over-expression of circular ribonucleic acid 0001588 reduced reactive oxygen species production and malonaldehyde levels and increased superoxide dismutase, glutathione, and levels via activation signal pathway of silent information regulator 1/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2/heme oxygenase-1 signaling pathway by miR-211-5p up-regulation in vitro. Over-expression of miR-211-5p attenuated the role of circular ribonucleic acid 0001588 on Alzheimer's disease-induced oxidative stress. Also, activation of the silent information regulator 1 pathway attenuated the antioxidative effects of circular ribonucleic acid 0001588 down-regulation on oxidative stress by activating silent information regulator 1/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2/heme oxygenase-1 in vitro. In conclusion, our findings indicated that circular ribonucleic acid 0001588 induced the silent information regulator 1/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2-dependent heme oxygenase-1 pathway to prevent oxidative stress by miR-211-5p in the rat model or in vitro model of a sporadic type of Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, the expression of the circular ribonucleic acid 0001588 gene was inhibited in rodent Alzheimer's disease model.
