33924772|t|From Channels to Canonical Wnt Signaling: A Pathological Perspective.
33924772|a|Wnt signaling is an important pathway mainly active during embryonic development and controlling cell proliferation. This regulatory pathway is aberrantly activated in several human diseases. Ion channels are known modulators of several important cellular functions ranging from the tuning of the membrane potential to modulation of intracellular pathways, in particular the influence of ion channels in Wnt signaling regulation has been widely investigated. This review will discuss the known links between ion channels and canonical Wnt signaling, focusing on their possible roles in human metabolic diseases, neurological disorders, and cancer.
