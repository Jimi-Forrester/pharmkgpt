35221993|t|Differential Diagnosis of Rare Subtypes of Progressive Supranuclear Palsy and PSP-Like Syndromes-Infrequent Manifestations of the Most Common Form of Atypical Parkinsonism.
35221993|a|Presently, there is increasing interest in rare PSP (progressive supranuclear palsy) variants, including PSP-PGF (PSP-progressive gait freezing), PSP-PI (PSP-postural instability), PSP-OM (PSP-ocular motor dysfunction), PSP-C (PSP-predominant cerebellar ataxia), PSP-CBS (PSP-corticobasal syndrome), PSP-SL (PSP-speech/language disorders), and PSP-PLS (PSP-primary lateral sclerosis). Diagnosis of these subtypes is usually based on clinical symptoms, thus thorough examination with anamnesis remains a major challenge for clinicians. The individual phenotypes often show great similarity to various neurodegenerative diseases and other genetic, autoimmune, or infectious disorders, manifesting as PSP-mimicking syndromes. At the current stage of knowledge, it is not possible to isolate a specific marker to make a definite ante-mortem diagnosis. The purpose of this review is to discuss recent developments in rare PSP phenotypes and PSP-like syndromes.
