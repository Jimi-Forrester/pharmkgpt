32743259|t|The Need for Actions Against Polypharmacy in Older People With Frailty.
32743259|a|Providing safe and effective drug therapy to older patients is challenging for physicians since there is not sufficient evidence to support the efficacy of these drugs and this population is susceptible to adverse drug reactions. Special consideration is needed when treating patients who require nursing care or who are at a stage prior to disability (i.e., frailty) because they may have limited life expectancies, complications, or organ dysfunction. Polypharmacy refers to the condition in which a patient is taking many drugs and, thus, is at an increased risk of adverse events. Although it is difficult to avoid polypharmacy in older people with frailty, the periodic review of drugs and reduction of dose or discontinuation of potentially inappropriate medications are needed to address this problem. This article reviews the association between frailty and polypharmacy and counteractions against polypharmacy in patients with frailty.
