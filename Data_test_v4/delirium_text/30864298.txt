30864298|a|AIM: Most patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) experience poor food intake and/or loss of appetite, which accelerates cognitive impairment. Several reports have shown that rivastigmine improves appetite in AD patients. The present study investigated the efficacy of a rivastigmine transdermal patch for the treatment of low food intake in AD patients. METHODS: AD patients, recruited through the Attitude Towards Food Consumption in Alzheimer's Disease Patients Revive with Rivastigmine Effects study, were recognized as experiencing either a loss of appetite or poor food intake. A rivastigmine transdermal patch was administered to study participants for 16 weeks. Patients' food intake, bodyweight, Mini-Mental State Examination scores and any adverse events were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 38 patients with AD (age 86.2 +- 5.4 years) were examined. Their mean Mini-Mental State Examination score was 10.1 +- 7.0 at baseline. A significant increase in food intake amount (54.9 +- 98.0 g, P < 0.01) and food intake ratio (9.3% +- 17.6%, P < 0.01) was observed by week 1, improvements that were maintained throughout the study duration. A multiple linear regression analysis showed that no independent variables were significantly associated with changes in food intake amount or ratio. Patients in the higher Mini-Mental State Examination subgroup showed a trend change in food intake amount, although this did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.07). CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggests that a rivastigmine transdermal patch might improve poor food intake or loss of appetite in patients with AD. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2019; 19: 571-576.
