38712998|t|Relationship Between Coronary Artery Revascularization and Postoperative Delirium: Progress and Perspectives.
38712998|a|Brain dysfunction resulting from damage to the heart-brain link leads to a decline in cognitive function. This, in turn, gives rise to the clinical symptom of perioperative delirium in patients undergoing coronary artery revascularization. Those affected are provided symptomatic treatment, but many do not recover fully. Thus, medium- and long-term mortality and adverse event rates remain relatively high in patients with perioperative delirium. Despite the relatively high incidence of perioperative delirium in patients undergoing coronary artery revascularization, it has not been systematically investigated. Inflammation, vascular damage, neuronal damage, and embolism are all involved in the injury process. Here, we discuss the incidence rate, pathological mechanisms, and prognosis of delirium after coronary artery revascularization. We also discuss in detail the risk factors for delirium after coronary artery revascularization, such as anxiety, depression, mode of operation, and drug use. We hope that prevention, early diagnosis, assessment, and potential treatment can be achieved by cardiologists to improve patient prognosis.
