34732953|a|Dementia is an eurodegenerative disorder, which causes significant disability, especially among the elderly population worldwide. The affected person shows a progressive cognitive decline, which interferes with the independence in performing the activities of daily living. Other than the cognitive domain, the patient tends to have neuropsychiatric, behavioral, sensorimotor, speech, and language-related issues. It is expected that the global burden of the disease will rise with more people entering the geriatric age group. By 2050 close, to 140 million people will be living with one or the other type of dementia. Alzheimer's disease contributes to more than 60% of cases worldwide, followed by vascular dementia. Pharmacotherapy has a limited role to play in the treatment, and at present, no drug is available, which can halt or reverse the progress of the disease. World Health Organization has mandated rehabilitation as a core recommendation in the global action plan on the public health response to dementia. Rehabilitation services are widely recognized as a practical framework to maximize independence and community participation in dementia care. The rehabilitation program is customized to achieve the desired goals, as each person has different experiences, preferences, motivations, strengths, and requirements based on type, course, and severity of the illness. It is an interdisciplinary-team approach with the involvement of several health care professionals. This article reviews the existing literature and outlines the effective rehabilitation strategies concisely in dementia care.
