2227467|t|Labyrinth learning impairment in patients with early symptoms of presenile dementia.
2227467|a|21 patients (54 +/- 7 years old) with early cognitive deficit (ECD) during the presenile stage of presumptive primary degenerative dementia (mild stage) and 14 patients (54 +/- 4 years old) with early cognitive deficit with a background of cardiovascular disease (CVD) were examined in a labyrinth learning test of Milner (modified by Roth). 15 patients in the ECD group made 3 times more errors to negative fields (p less than 0.01), about 10 times more errors to positive fields (p less than 0.01) and needed treble the amount of time for passing through the labyrinth (p less than 0.01) compared with a healthy control group (51 +/- 4 years). A further 6 patients of the ECD group had no success in performing the labyrinth test. The CVD group was not different from the control group in making errors, but slower (p less than 0.05). The labyrinth test is found suitable for a more precise diagnosis of early cognitive deficit in the early stage of a primary degenerative dementia of the Alzheimer type.
