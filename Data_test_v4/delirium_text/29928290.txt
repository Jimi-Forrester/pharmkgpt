29928290|a|BACKGROUND: Neurosyphilis remains a diagnostic challenge in current psychiatric practice because of its pleomorphic psychiatric manifestations. Although neurosyphilis can present with a wide range of psychiatric symptoms, psychotic mania as its solitary manifestation is an unusual phenomenon. CASE PRESENTATION: A 46-year-old man, with no history of any psychiatric disorder, exhibited abruptly developed symptoms of psychotic mania. He was admitted to a psychiatric ward for further evaluation and treatment. Upon admission, his cognitive function was unimpaired, and the hyperactivity was not severe. Also, no abnormalities were found upon neurological examination and brain magnetic resonance imaging. He was initially diagnosed as bipolar disorder with psychotic features. On the 3rd day after admission, he was confirmed as having neurosyphilis by analysis of cerebrospinal fluid and treated with intravenous penicillin-in combination with blonanserin-an atypical antipsychotic drug. After 2 weeks of treatment, most of the symptoms had abated. CONCLUSIONS: The present case emphasizes that patients presenting with atypical psychiatric manifestation should be screened for possible syphilis, particularly in the absence of previous psychiatric history, and suggests that combination of blonanserin with antibiotic therapy may be effective in the treatment of the manic and psychotic symptoms secondary to neurosyphilis.
