36051596|a|The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been linked to an increased prevalence of mental health disorders, particularly anxiety and depression. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused stress in people worldwide due to several factors, including fear of infection; social isolation; difficulty in adapting to new routines; lack of coping methods; high exposure to social media, misinformation, and fake reports; economic impact of the measures implemented to slow the contagion and concerns regarding the disease pathogenesis. COVID-19 patients have elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and other inflammation-related factors. Furthermore, invasion of the central nervous system by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may potentially contribute to neuroinflammatory alterations in infected individuals. Neuroinflammation, a consequence of psychological stress due to the COVID-19 pandemic, may also play a role in the development of anxiety and depressive symptoms in the general population. Considering that neuroinflammation plays a significant role in the pathophysiology of depression and anxiety, this study investigated the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on mental health and focused on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the neuroinflammatory pathways.
