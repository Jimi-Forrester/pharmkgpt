32596307|a|The systemic administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) has been recognized to induce neuroinflammation which plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. In this study, we aimed to determine the protective effect of Zingiber cassumunar (Z. cassumunar) or Phlai (in Thai) against LPS-induced neuronal cell loss and the upregulation of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) of astrocytes in the hippocampus. Adult male Wistar rats were orally administered with Z. cassumunar extract at various doses (50, 100, and 200 mg/kg body weight) for 14 days before a single injection of LPS (250 mug/kg/i.p.). The results indicated that LPS-treated animals exhibited neuronal cell loss and the activation of astrocytes and also increased proinflammatory cytokine interleukin- (IL-) 1beta in the hippocampus. Pretreatment with Z. cassumunar markedly reduced neuronal cell loss in the hippocampus. In addition, Z. cassumunar extract at a dose of 200 mg/kg BW significantly suppressed the inflammatory response by reducing the expression of GFAP and IL-1ss in the hippocampus. Therefore, the results suggested that Z. cassumunar extract might be valuable as a neuroprotective agent in neuroinflammation-induced brain damage. However, further investigations are essential to validate the possible active ingredients and mechanisms of its neuroprotective effect.
