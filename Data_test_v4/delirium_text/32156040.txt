32156040|t|Effect of Metformin on Doxorubicin-Induced Memory Dysfunction.
32156040|a|Doxorubicin (DOX) is widely used to treat many types of cancer; however, it is associated with chemotherapy-related complications such as cognitive dysfunction, known as chemobrain. Chemobrain affects up to 75% of cancer survivors, and there are currently no available therapeutic options. This study aims to examine whether metformin (MET) can protect against the neurotoxicity caused by DOX treatment. Forty male rats were divided into four groups (10 rats/group): control, DOX, DOX + MET, and MET. Rats treated with DOX received five doses of 4 mg/kg DOX weekly (cumulative dose: 20 mg/kg). For the DOX-MET and MET groups, MET (3 mg/mL) was dissolved in drinking water. Behavioral and glucose tests were performed one day after treatment was completed. We found DOX (4 mg/kg/week, 5 weeks) caused learning and memory impairment in the Y-maze, novel object recognition, and elevated plus maze behavioral tests. MET did not rescue these DOX-induced memory impairments. Neither DOX nor MET nor MET + DOX altered glucose levels following the treatment. In summary, DOX treatment is associated with memory impairment in rats, but MET does not rescue this cognitive dysfunction.
