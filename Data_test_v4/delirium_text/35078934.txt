35078934|t|Cross-alpha/beta polymorphism of PSMalpha3 fibrils.
35078934|a|The formation of ordered cross-beta amyloid protein aggregates is associated with a variety of human disorders. While conventional infrared methods serve as sensitive reporters of the presence of these amyloids, the recently discovered amyloid secondary structure of cross-alpha fibrils presents new questions and challenges. Herein, we report results using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy to monitor the aggregation of one such cross-alpha-forming peptide, phenol soluble modulin alpha 3 (PSMalpha3). Phenol soluble modulins (PSMs) are involved in the formation and stabilization of Staphylococcus aureus biofilms, making sensitive methods of detecting and characterizing these fibrils a pressing need. Our experimental data coupled with spectroscopic simulations reveals the simultaneous presence of cross-alpha and cross-beta polymorphs within samples of PSMalpha3 fibrils. We also report a new spectroscopic feature indicative of cross-alpha fibrils.
