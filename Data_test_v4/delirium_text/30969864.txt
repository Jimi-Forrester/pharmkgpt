30969864|t|Postoperative cognitive decline: the nurse's role in identifying this underestimated and misinterpreted condition.
30969864|a|BACKGROUND: postoperative cognitive changes can increase morbidity and mortality, demand for postoperative care and social and health costs, and can lead to dementia. AIM: this article discusses perioperative variables that can be used to identify patients who are more vulnerable to experiencing cognitive decline after surgery. It also highlights some screening tools that could be useful for early detection and for planning nursing care. METHOD: a literature search was conducted using the Medline, CINAHL, PsychINFO and Cochrane Library databases from 2010 to 2018. Google Scholar was also consulted. The reference lists of relevant articles covering postoperative delirium (POD) and postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) were reviewed for further relevant papers. CONCLUSION: assessment and evaluation of a patient's cognitive resources before and after surgery can lead to clinical interventions to support the person's coping mechanisms; health professionals can reduce the short- and long-term effects of cognitive decline. Screening tools could be used as part of a strategy to minimise postoperative cognitive changes.
