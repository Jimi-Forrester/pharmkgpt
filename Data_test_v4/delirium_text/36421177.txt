36421177|a|Beta-amyloid (betaA) peptides accompanying the physiological change in brain induce Alzheimer's disease. In this work, a highly sensitive electrochemical (EC) immunosensor platform has been developed for the quantitative detection of betaA peptides, using the gold nanoparticle functionalized chitosan-aligned carbon nanotube (CS-aCNT-Au) nanocomposites on glassy carbon electrodes (GCE). The immunosensor has been fabricated by immobilization of the anti-betaA antibody upon CS-aCNT-Au/GCE. In the CS-aCNT nanocomposite, CS has high biocompatibility. Hydroxy and amine functionalities favor the antibody immobilization and prevent the leaching of nanocomposites of the modified electrode due to the adhesive environment. Moreover, aCNT offers high conductivity, stability, and a large surface area (the calculated effective surface area of the CS-aCNT/GCE is 8.594 x 10-2 cm2). However, the incorporation of AuNPs further enhances the conductivity of the CS-aCNT-Au nanocomposite based on differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) results, and also improves the effective surface area (9.735 x 10-2 cm2). The surface morphology and electrochemical studies of the nanocomposite, as well as its modifications by the anti-betaA antibody and BSA, were carried out through field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), cyclic voltammetry (CV), and DPV. The quantitative immunosensing of the betaA in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution is accomplished via DPV, which reveals that the immunosensor has a high sensitivity of 157.60 microA pg-1 mL cm-2 and a broad detection range of 10.0 pg mL-1-100.0 microg mL-1, with a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.87 pg mL-1. Subsequently, we detected the spiked betaA in diluted serum with a linear detection range of 10.0 pg mL-1-1.0 ng mL-1 and LOD of 0.95 pg mL-1. Moreover, a selectivity study exhibited a high affinity of immunosensors towards betaA. Thus, we propose that this highly efficient immunosensor can potentially be applied for the point-of-care (POC) sensing of betaA in clinical samples.
