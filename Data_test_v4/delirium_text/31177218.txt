Research investigating longitudinal QoL in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is currently lacking. OBJECTIVE: To investigate determinants and trajectories of QoL in DLB compared to Alzheimer's disease (AD) and controls. METHODS: QoL was assessed annually in 138 individuals, using the EQ5D-utility-score (0-100) and the health-related Visual Analogue Scale (VAS, 0-100). Twenty-nine DLB patients (age 69+-6), 68 AD patients (age 70+-6), and 41 controls (age 70+-5) were selected from the Dutch Parelsnoer Institute-Neurodegenerative diseases and Amsterdam Dementia Cohort. We examined clinical work-up over time as determinants of QoL, including cognitive tests, neuropsychiatric inventory, Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), and disability assessment of dementia (DAD). RESULTS: Mixed models showed lower baseline VAS-scores in DLB compared to AD and controls (AD: beta+-SE = -7.6+-2.8, controls: beta+-SE = -7.9+-3.0, p < 0.05). An interaction between diagnosis and time since diagnosis indicated steeper decline on VAS-scores for AD patients compared to DLB patients (beta+-SE = 2.9+-1.5, p < 0.1). EQ5D-utility-scores over time did not differ between groups. Higher GDS and lower DAD-scores were independently associated with lower QoL in dementia patients (GDS: VAS beta+-SE = -1.8+-0.3, EQ5D-utility beta+-SE = -3.7+-0.4; DAD: VAS = 0.1+-0.0, EQ5D-utility beta+-SE = 0.1+-0.1, p < 0.05). No associations between cognitive tests and QoL remained in the multivariate model. CONCLUSION: QoL is lower in DLB, while in AD QoL shows steeper decline as the disease advances. Our results indicate that non-cognitive symptoms, more than cognitive symptoms, are highly relevant as they impact QoL.
