Parahippocampal atrophy at VSASD was observed in 5 AD patients, 6 amnestic and PiB-positive MCI patients, 1 amnestic and PiB-negative MCI patient, and 1 vascular dementia patient. Parietal lobe hypoperfusion in SPECT findings was observed in 6, 4, and 2 of those, respectively, as well as 1 each of non-amnestic MCI, vascular dementia, and normal cases. Sensitivity/specificity/accuracy for selecting PiB-positive patients among the 15 MCI patients for 11C-PiB-PET were 100% (9/9)/100% (6/6)/100% (15/15), for VSRAD were 66.7% (6/9)/83.3% (5/6)/73.3% (11/15), and for SPECT were 44.4% (4/9)/50.0% (3/6)/46.7% (7/15), while those were 88.9% (8/9)/33.3% (2/6)/66.7% (10/15)/for combined VSRAD and SPECT. 11C-PiB-PET accuracy was significantly higher than that of SPECT.11PiB-PET alone may be useful for selecting patients who will progress from MCI to AD in the future, although follow-up study is necessary to clarify the outcome of MCI patients.
