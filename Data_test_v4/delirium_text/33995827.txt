33995827|a|BACKGROUND: In TIA/ischemic stroke patients, the clinical significance of lobar microbleeds potentially indicating cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is unknown. We assessed vascular risk factors and outcomes, including cognition, in TIA/ischemic stroke patients with neuroimaging evidence of probable/possible CAA. METHODS: This prospective cohort was conducted from August 2015 and January 2018 at 40 centers. 2625 participants were collected. Eligible participants were aged at least 55 years. Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score is less than or equal to 26. A total of 1620 patients were included. 1604 (99.0%) and 1582 (97.7%) participants are followed up at 3 and 12 months. The primary outcomes were death or disability (mRS score, 3-6) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) at 3 months and 12 months. Demographic and vascular risk factors were measured at baseline (smoking, alcohol, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, coronary artery disease, ischemic stroke, and transient ischemic attack). Blood samples were collected within 24 hours of admission. MRI was recommended for all patients. MoCA score was evaluated at baseline and follow-up. RESULTS: In total, 291/1620 patients with ischemic stroke/TIA (32.7% female and mean age, 67.8 years) had neuroimaging evidence of probable/possible CAA. Higher age, history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, ischemic stroke, alcohol, and high glucose at the admission were more common in the patients. Mean MoCA changed from 21.4 at 3 months (SD 5.2) to 22.3 at 12 months (SD 4.7), difference 0.3 (SD 3.8). At the 3-month and 12-month follow-up, there were significant differences in age, education level, and sex among different cognitive groups. Higher age, lower education (less than high school), and female sex were the predictors of changing in MoCA score from 3 months to 12 months. Moreover, age (more than 66 years) and education (less than high school) are strongly associated with MoCA at 3- and 12-month follow-up. 30 of 286 (10.5%) and 37 of 281 (13.2%) patients had poor outcome of death or disability (modified Rankin Scale score, 3-6) at follow-up 3 and 12 months. Cortical superficial siderosis (cSS) was associated with higher mRS at follow-up. cSS status, cSS count 1-2, cSS strictly lobar, and strictly deep might be the risks of outcomes in adjusted analyses. CONCLUSION: This study suggested that an increasing number of vascular risk factors and imaging markers were significantly associated with outcomes of TIA/ischemic stroke patients with CAA pattern. Male, young patients with high education should get better cognitive recovery.
