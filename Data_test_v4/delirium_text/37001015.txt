37001015|t|A Modular Strategy for the Synthesis of Dothideopyrones E and F, Secondary Metabolites from an Endolichenic Fungus.
37001015|a|Endolichenic fungi are a rich source of natural products with a wide range of potent bioactivities. Herein, syntheses of the two naturally occurring alpha-pyrones dothideopyrone E and F are presented. These natural products were isolated from a culture of the endolichenic fungus Dothideomycetes sp. EL003334. The outlined strategy includes a Fu-Suzuki akyl-alkyl cross-coupling, a MacMillan alpha-oxyamination, and a Sato's pericyclic cascade process to construct the 4-hydroxy-2-pyrone ring system. All the obtained data on the synthesized compounds matched with that of the isolated material.
