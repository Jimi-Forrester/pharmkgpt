1686563|a|Transgenic mice for the human amyloid precursor protein 695 (APP695) isoform may provide an animal model of Alzheimer's disease (AD). To evaluate this, the spatial learning abilities of transgenic and wild strain mice were compared in the Morris water maze task. The transgenic mice were significantly retarded in initial learning and in learning a new escape location, although in each case they eventually reached control levels. The transgenic mice also showed slower swimming speed and reduced nocturnal activity, which may contribute to their deficit in spatial learning. Preliminary neuropathological investigations failed to reveal amyloid depositions. Thus, a gene dosage effect of APP695 may account for the memory impairment but not the plaque formation associated with AD.
