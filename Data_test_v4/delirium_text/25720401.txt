25720401|t|A Simple Tool to Reach Populations at Risk for Developing Dementia and Alzheimer's Disease.
25720401|a|Identification of individuals at high risk for developing dementia and Alzheimer's disease is a major challenge. A "memory fair" is an enjoyable and affordable tool designed to reach local population at risk, mainly those with subjective cognitive impairment (SCI) or mild cognitive impairment. The fair included a free cognitive assessment and presentation on the importance of sleep, physical activity, cognitive training, and risk-factors and provided personalized recommendations. 160 individuals completed the evaluation (69.97 +- 9.01 y, 83% women). Average Montreal Cognitive Assessment Score (MoCA) was 24.73 +- 3.71. Six percent reported SCI and an upper estimate of mild cognitive impairment prevalence was 30.7% . SCI was found to be a sensitive predictor for MoCA <26.
