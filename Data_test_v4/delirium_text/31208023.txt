31208023|t|Suppression of AMD-Like Pathology by Mitochondria-Targeted Antioxidant SkQ1 Is Associated with a Decrease in the Accumulation of Amyloid beta and in mTOR Activity.
31208023|a|Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a major cause of irreversible visual impairment and blindness in developed countries, and the molecular pathogenesis of AMD is poorly understood. Recent studies strongly indicate that amyloid beta (Abeta) accumulation -found in the brain and a defining feature of Alzheimer's disease-also forms in the retina in both Alzheimer's disease and AMD. The reason why highly neurotoxic proteins of consistently aggregate in the aging retina, and to what extent they contribute to AMD, remains to be fully addressed. Nonetheless, the hypothesis that Abeta is a therapeutic target in AMD is debated. Here, we showed that long-term treatment with SkQ1 (250 nmol/[kg body weight] daily from the age of 1.5 to 22 months) suppressed the development of AMD-like pathology in senescence-accelerated OXYS rats by reducing the level of Abeta and suppressing the activity of mTOR in the retina. Inhibition of mTOR signaling activity, which plays key roles in aging and age-related diseases, can be considered a new mechanism of the prophylactic effect of SkQ1. It seems probable that dietary supplementation with mitochondria-targeted antioxidant SkQ1 can be a good prevention strategy to maintain eye health and possibly a treatment of AMD.
