14995937|a|BACKGROUND: Post-operative mental dysfunction may be an important problem in elderly patients. This study was designed to compare the effects of propofol and sevoflurane anesthesia on recovery characteristics and the incidence of post-operative delirium (POD) in long-duration laparoscopic surgery for elderly patients. METHODS: Fifty ASA physical status I-II patients over the age of 65 scheduled for laparoscopic surgery lasting 3 h or more randomly received propofol (group P, n = 25) or sevoflurane (group S, n = 25) for both induction and maintenance of general anesthesia. Both groups were combined with continuous perioperative epidural analgesia. The level of primary anesthetics was adjusted to maintain changes in mean arterial pressure within 20% of the pre-anesthetic values. The emergence times from anesthesia (eye opening, extubation, response to command, and orientation) were recorded, and the occurrence of POD was assessed by the delirium rating scale (DRS) during the first 3 days after surgery. All patients received oxygen and continuous epidural analgesia postoperatively. RESULTS: Immediate emergence, i.e. eye opening and extubation was significantly faster after sevoflurane (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference between the incidences of POD in the two groups during the first 3 days after surgery. The scores for DRS on day 2 and 3 after surgery, however, were significantly higher in group P than in group S (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Sevoflurane may be preferable to propofol for general anesthesia in combination with epidural analgesia with respect to less effect on mental function during the early postoperative period for long-duration laparoscopic surgery in elderly patients.
