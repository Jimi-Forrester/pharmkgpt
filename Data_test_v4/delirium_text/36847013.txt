36847013|t|Playing Russian Roulette with Alzheimer's Disease Patients: Do the Cognitive Benefits of Lecanemab Outweigh the Risk of Edema, Stroke and Encephalitis?
36847013|a|The questionable approval of aducanumab and the recent approval of lecanemab (Leqembi; Eisai and Biogen) by the FDA has raised the issue of safety (stroke, meningitis, and encephalitis) over efficacy (slowing of cognitive decline). This communication recounts the important physiological functions of amyloid-beta as a barrier protein with unique sealant and anti-pathogenic activities important for maintaining vascular integrity coupled with innate immune functions that prevent encephalitis and meningitis. The approval of a drug that obviates both of these purposive functions increases the risk of hemorrhage, edema and downstream pathogenic outcomes and should be clearly outlined to patients.
