37873223|t|The human microglia responsome: a resource to better understand microglia states in health and disease.
37873223|a|Microglia, the immune cells of the brain, are increasingly implicated in neurodegenerative disorders through genetic studies. However, how genetic risk factors for these diseases are related to microglial gene expression, microglial function, and ultimately disease, is still largely unknown. Microglia change rapidly in response to alterations in their cellular environment, which is regulated through changes in transcriptional programs, which are as yet poorly understood. Here, we compared the effects of a set of inflammatory and restorative stimuli (lipopolysaccharide, interferon-gamma, resiquimod, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, adenosine triphosphate, dexamethasone, and interleukin-4) on human microglial cells from 67 different donors (N = 398 samples) at the gene and transcript level. We show that microglia from different anatomical brain regions show distinct responses to inflammatory stimuli. We observed a greater overlap between human stimulated microglia and human monocytes than with mouse microglia. We define specific microglial signatures across conditions which are highly relevant for a wide range of biological functions and complex human diseases. Finally, we used our stimulation signatures to interpret associations from Alzheimer's disease (AD) genetic studies and microglia by integrating our inflammatory gene expression profiles with common genetic variants to map cis -expression QTLs (eQTLs). Together, we provide the most comprehensive transcriptomic database of the human microglia responsome. Highlights: RNA-sequencing of 398 human microglial samples exposed to six different triggers.Microglia from different anatomical regions show distinct stimulation responses.Responses in human microglia show a greater overlap with human monocytes than murine microglia.Mapping of response Quantitative Trait Loci identifies interactions between genotype and effect of stimulation on gene expression.Our atlas provides a reference map for interpreting microglia signatures in health and disease.
