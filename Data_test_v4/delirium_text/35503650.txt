35503650|t|Delivering Personalized Recommendations to Support Caregivers of People Living With Dementia: Mixed Methods Study.
35503650|a|BACKGROUND: Estimates suggest that 6.2 million Americans aged >=65 years are living with Alzheimer dementia in 2021, and by 2060, this number could more than double to 13.8 million. As a result, public health officials anticipate a greater need for caregivers of persons with Alzheimer disease or related dementia and support resources for both people living with dementia and their caregivers. Despite the growing need for dementia caregiver support services, there is a lack of consensus regarding how to tailor these services to best meet the heterogeneous needs of individual caregivers. To fill this gap, Care to Plan (CtP), a web-based tool for caregivers of people living with dementia, was developed to provide tailored support recommendations to dementia caregivers. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to formally explore the feasibility, acceptability, and utility of CtP for 20 family members of people living with dementia within a health system over a 1-month time period using a mixed methods parallel convergent design. METHODS: A moderately sized health system in the mid-Atlantic region was selected as the site for CtP implementation, where 20 caregivers who were family members of people living with dementia were enrolled. The web-based CtP tool was used by caregivers and facilitated by a health care professional (ie, a senior care navigator [SCN]). Caregivers were given a 21-item review checklist to assess barriers and facilitators associated with reviewing CtP with an SCN. Following the 21-item review checklist, semistructured telephone interviews, which included 18 open-ended questions, focused on the facilitators of and barriers to CtP implementation and recommendations for future implementation. RESULTS: Quantitative results suggested that 85% (17/20) of caregivers indicated that CtP was helpful and 90% (18/20) would recommend CtP to someone in a similar situation. The qualitative analysis identified 4 themes regarding facilitators of and barriers to implementation: caregiver factors, SCN factors, CtP tool system factors, and recommendations and resources factors. CONCLUSIONS: CtP was found to be not only feasible but also a valuable tool for caregivers seeking resources for themselves and their people living with dementia. Long-term evaluation findings aim to generate results on how CtP can be integrated into care plans for caregivers and how SCNs can provide additional support for caregivers of people living with dementia over an extended period.
