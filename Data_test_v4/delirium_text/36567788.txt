36567788|a|To summarize the most impactful articles relevant to the pharmacotherapy of critically ill adult patients published in 2021. DATA SOURCE: PubMed/MEDLINE. STUDY SELECTION: Randomized controlled trials, prospective studies, or systematic review/meta-analyses of adult critical care patients assessing a pharmacotherapeutic intervention and reporting clinical endpoints published between January 1, 2021, and December 31, 2021. DATA EXTRACTION: Candidate articles were organized by clinical domain based on the emerging themes from all studies. A modified Delphi process was applied to obtain consensus on the most impactful publication within each clinical domain based on overall contribution to scientific knowledge and novelty to the literature. DATA SYNTHESIS: The search revealed 830 articles, of which 766 were excluded leaving 64 candidate articles for the Delphi process. These 64 articles were organized by clinical domain including: emergency/neurology, cardiopulmonary, nephrology/fluids, infectious diseases, metabolic, immunomodulation, and nutrition/gastroenterology. Each domain required the a priori defined three Delphi rounds. The resultant most impactful articles from each domain included five randomized controlled trials and two systematic review/meta-analyses. Topics studied included sedation during mechanical ventilation, anticoagulation in COVID-19, extended infusion beta-lactams, interleukin-6 antagonists in COVID-19, balanced crystalloid resuscitation, vitamin C/thiamine/hydrocortisone in sepsis, and promotility agents during enteral feeding. CONCLUSIONS: This synoptic review provides a summary and perspective of the most impactful articles relevant to the pharmacotherapy of critically ill adults published in 2021.
