23554703|t|Relationship between nerve injury-induced protein gene 2 polymorphism and stroke in Chinese Han population.
23554703|a|The aim of present study was to investigate the relationship between nerve injury-induced protein 2 (NINJ2) gene polymorphism and stroke in Chinese Han population. Fifty-two patients with large-artery atherosclerosis (LAA) infarction, 85 patients with small-artery occlusion lacunar (SAO) infarction, 50 patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and 66 controls were included. Genotypes and alleles frequencies of the two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of NINJ2 among different groups were analyzed and compared. In regard to rs12425791, the frequencies of the AG and AA+AG genotypes of the LAA and SAO groups were significantly higher than those in the control group; the frequency of the A allele of the SAO group was significantly higher than that of the control group. In regard to rs11833579, there were not any significant differences between the case and the control groups. The SNP rs12425791 is significantly associated with ischemic stroke, and the A allele increases the susceptibility to stroke. The SNP rs11833579 is not significantly associated with stroke.
