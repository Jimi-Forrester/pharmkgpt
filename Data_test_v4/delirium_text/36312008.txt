36312008|t|Altered stability of brain functional architecture after sleep deprivation: A resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging study.
36312008|a|Background and aims: Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies using static and dynamic functional connectivity (FC) approaches have revealed brain dysfunction resulting from sleep deprivation (SD). The effects of SD on the stability of brain functional architecture remain unclear. This study investigated the functional stability (FS) changes induced by SD and its association with neurocognitive alterations. Materials and methods: In this study, we recruited 24 healthy women. All participants underwent two sessions of resting-state fMRI scanning and neurocognitive assessment. The assessments included the Digit Symbol Test, Digit Span Test, Trail-Making Test (TMT), and Complex Figure Test (CFT). Participants completed one session under rested wakefulness (RW) and one session after SD for 24 h. To estimate dynamic FC, we used the sliding window approach; and then, to characterize the FS of each voxel, we measured dynamic FC concordance over time. We used a paired t-test to identify differences in FS between RW and SD. To examine the relationship between these changes in FS and alterations in neurocognitive performance, we conducted Spearman's correlation analyses. Results: SD affected the performance of the Digit Symbol Test, Digit Span Test, and CFT. Compared with RW, subjects with SD exhibited decreased FS in the bilateral anterior and posterior cingulate gyrus and medial frontal gyrus, right superior frontal gyrus, and cerebellum posterior lobe, while they exhibited increased FS in the bilateral precentral/postcentral gyrus and supplementary motor area, right parahippocampal gyrus and fusiform gyrus, left inferior occipital gyrus, and bilateral cerebellum anterior lobe. After SD, FS changes in the right parahippocampal gyrus and fusiform gyrus were correlated with altered performance in the Digit Symbol Test and CFT. Conclusion: Our findings showed that the stability of the brain's functional architecture could be altered by SD. This stability alteration may correspond to multiple neurocognitive domain changes.
