18609064|a|OBJECTIVES: We wanted to identify determinants for postoperative delirium and its influence on health related quality of life (HRQoL) during 36-month follow-up of coronary artery bypass (CABG) patients. DESIGN: A total of 302 patients were retrospectively analyzed. HRQoL was assessed prospectively by the 15D instrument. Delirium was diagnosed clinically. RESULTS: The incidence of delirium was 6.0%. The cumulative survival (all-cause death) in 36 months was 96.1% in patients without delirium and 77.8% in patients with delirium. Age, cerebral disease, chronic heart failure, male gender, postoperative pneumonia and low output syndrome were predictors for delirium. Delirium patients needed more resources i.e. intensive care or total duration of hospitalization and experienced no positive change in HRQoL. Moreover patients with high preoperative 15D score tended to suffer fairly severe but reversible impairment during the first 6 months after the operation. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperatively older and sicker patients with complicated postoperative course are at higher risk of developing delirium after CABG. Preoperative status and operative complications together with delirium may exert negative influence on forthcoming HRQoL, which is seen especially in patients with a relatively high preoperative level of HRQoL.
