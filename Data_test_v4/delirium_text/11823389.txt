11823389|a|PURPOSE: To investigate whether antidepressants administered to patients for chronic depression patients should be continued or discontinued before anesthesia. RESULTS: We studied 80 depressed patients who were scheduled to undergo orthopedic surgery under general anesthesia. The patients were divided randomly into two groups; patients in Group A (n=40) continued antidepressants before surgery and patients in Group B (n=40) discontinued antidepressants 72 hr before surgery. Two (5%) out of 40 patients in Group A and eight (20%) out of 40 patients in Group B had deterioration of depressive symptoms (P=0.04). Delirium or confusion during the perioperative course occurred in five patients (13%) in Group A and in 12 (30%) in Group B (P=0.05). There were no significant differences in incidence (5 vs 6%) of hypotension and arrhythmias during anesthesia between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Antidepressants administered to depressed patients should be continued before anesthesia. Discontinuation of antidepressants did not increase the incidence of hypotension and arrhythmias during anesthesia, but increased symptoms of depression and delirium or confusion.
