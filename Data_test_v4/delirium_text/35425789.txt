35425789|a|The Sceletium genus has been of medicinal importance in southern Africa for millennia and Sceletium tortuosum (Aizoaceae), one of eight species in the genus has gained pharmaceutical importance as an anxiolytic and anti-depressant due to the presence of mesembrine alkaloids. S. tortuosum is used for the manufacture of herbal teas, dietary supplements and other phytopharmaceutical products. This study aimed to provide a metabolomic characterization of S. tortuosum and its sister species as these are not easy to distinguish using morphology alone. Plant samples were thus collected from various locations in the succulent Karoo (South Africa) and analyzed through liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), using MSE fragmentation as a putative tool for chemical identities. Metabolomics-based analyses in combination with molecular networking were able to distinguish between the four species of Sceletium based on the presence of 4-(3,4-dimethyoxyphenyl)-4-[2-acetylmethlamino)ethyl]cyclohexanone (m/z 334.2020; RT 6.60 min), mesembrine (m/z 290.1757; RT 5.10 min) and 4'-O-demethylmesembrenol (m/z 276.1597; RT 4.17 min). Metabolomic profiles varied according to the different localities and metabolites occurred at variable quantitative levels in Sceletium ecotypes. Molecular networking provided the added advantage of being able to observe mesembrine alkaloid isomers and coeluting metabolites (from the joubertiamine group) that were difficult to discern without this application. By combining high-throughput metabolomics together with global and feature based-molecular networking, a powerful metabolite profiling platform that is able to discern chemical patterns within and between populations was established. These techniques were able to reveal chemotaxonomic relationships and allowed for the discovery of chemical markers that may be used as part of monitoring protocols during the manufacture of phytopharmaceutical and dietary products based on Sceletium.
