23809965|t|Caregiver burden and psychosocial services in patients with early and late onset Alzheimer's disease.
23809965|a|INTRODUCTION: The purpose of the study was to analyse caregiver burden and consumption of psychosocial services in a consecutive group of patients with early onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) compared with a matching group with late onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). MATERIAL AND METHODS: This was a case-control study with 42 patients who were matched according to disease severity at the time of diagnosis. Caregivers in both groups were interviewed using the Neuro Psychiatric Inventory (NPI), the Activities of Daily Living (ADL) scale and the Resource Utilization in Dementia scale. The quantitative outcomes were compared statistically. RESULTS: The EOAD group had a significantly higher ADL score than the LOAD group. There was a trend towards caregivers in the LOAD group spending more time helping the patients, and they needed more social services than the EOAD group. NPI scores were not significantly different, but a tendency towards a higher caregiver burden in the EOAD group was observed. CONCLUSION: The higher caregiver burden in patients with EOAD--despite a better ADL function than LOAD patients--suggests that the existing psychosocial services might be particularly insufficient for caregivers in EOAD. FUNDING: The study was funded by a three-month scholarship grant from the research fund at Roskilde Hospital. TRIAL REGISTRATION: not relevant.
