38868734|a|Background: Trousseau syndrome is a hypercoagulability syndrome associated with cancer. It is known that delirium occasionally occurs after the onset of Trousseau syndrome. However, there have been no detailed reports about treatment for psychiatric symptoms of delirium associated with Trousseau syndrome. Case Presentation: A 61-year-old man with lung cancer was hospitalized due to Trousseau syndrome. Delirium occurred after hospitalization and psychiatric symptoms worsened. Although haloperidol, risperidone, and chlorpromazine were used, severe insomnia persisted. After memantine (5 mg/day) was used with perospirone, the patient's psychiatric symptoms gradually decreased; he could sleep for 4-5 h at night. Due to psychiatric improvement, he was able to return home and resume immunotherapy for lung cancer as scheduled. Conclusion: We report the first case of Trousseau syndrome delirium treated by memantine used with perospirone. Although further studies are needed, memantine and perospirone might be candidates for the management of psychiatric symptoms associated with Trousseau syndrome.
