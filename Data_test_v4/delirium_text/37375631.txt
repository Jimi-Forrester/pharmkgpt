37375631|t|Vitamin K and Hallmarks of Ageing: Focus on Diet and Gut Microbiome.
37375631|a|Vitamin K and vitamin K-dependent proteins have been reported to be associated with a large spectrum of age-related diseases. While most of these associations have been deduced from observational studies, solid evidence for the direct impact of vitamin K on cellular senescence remains to be proven. As vitamin K status reflects the complexity of interactions between dietary intake, gut microbiome activity and health, we will demonstrate the pivotal role of the diet-microbiome-health axis in human ageing and exemplify how vitamin K is implicated therein. We propose that food quality (i.e., food pattern) should be highlighted beyond the quantity of total vitamin K intake. Instead of focusing on a single nutrient, exploring a healthy diet containing vitamin K may be more strategic. As such, healthy eating patterns can be used to make dietary recommendations for the public. Emerging evidence suggests that dietary vitamin K is a modulator of the diet-microbiome-health axis, and this needs to be incorporated into the investigation of the impact of vitamin K on gut microbial composition and metabolic activities, along with host health outcomes. In addition, we highlight several critical caveats that need to be acknowledged regarding the interplay between diet, vitamin K, gut microbiome and host health that is pivotal for elucidating the role of vitamin K in ageing and responding to the urgent call of healthy eating concerning public health.
