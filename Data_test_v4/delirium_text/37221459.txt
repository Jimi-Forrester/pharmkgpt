37221459|a|Autoimmune diseases develop due to self-tolerance failure in recognizing self and non-self-antigens. Several factors play a role in inducing autoimmunity, including genetic and environmental elements. Several studies demonstrated the causative role of viruses; however, some studies showed the preventive effect of viruses in the development of autoimmunity. Neurological autoimmune diseases are classified based on the targets of autoantibodies, which target intracellular or extracellular antigens rather than neurons. Several theories have been hypothesized to explain the role of viruses in the pathogenesis of neuroinflammation and autoimmune diseases. This study reviewed the current data on the immunopathogenesis of viruses in autoimmunity of the nervous system.
