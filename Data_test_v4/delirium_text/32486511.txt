32486511|t|Redox Interactions of Vitamin C and Iron: Inhibition of the Pro-Oxidant Activity by Deferiprone.
32486511|a|Ascorbic acid (AscH2) is one of the most important vitamins found in the human diet, with many biological functions including antioxidant, chelating, and coenzyme activities. Ascorbic acid is also widely used in a medical practice especially for increasing the iron absorption and as an adjuvant therapeutic in the iron chelation therapy, but its mode of action and implications in the iron metabolism and toxicity are not yet clear. In this study, we used UV-Vis spectrophotometry, NMR spectroscopy, and EPR spin trapping spectroscopy to investigate the antioxidant/pro-oxidant effects of ascorbic acid in reactions involving iron and the iron chelator deferiprone (L1). The experiments were carried out in a weak acidic (pH from 3 to 5) and neutral (pH 7.4) medium. Ascorbic acid exhibits predominantly pro-oxidant activity by reducing Fe3+ to Fe2+, followed by the formation of dehydroascorbic acid. As a result, ascorbic acid accelerates the redox cycle Fe3+   Fe2+ in the Fenton reaction, which leads to a significant increase in the yield of toxic hydroxyl radicals. The analysis of the experimental data suggests that despite a much lower stability constant of the iron-ascorbate complex compared to the FeL13 complex, ascorbic acid at high concentrations is able to substitute L1 in the FeL13 chelate complex resulting in the formation of mixed L12AscFe complex. This mixed chelate complex is redox stable at neutral pH = 7.4, but decomposes at pH = 4-5 during several minutes at sub-millimolar concentrations of ascorbic acid. The proposed mechanisms play a significant role in understanding the mechanism of action, pharmacological, therapeutic, and toxic effects of the interaction of ascorbic acid, iron, and L1.
