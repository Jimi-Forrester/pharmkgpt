29721504|a|The present study aimed to investigate the impact of a 6-month multicomponent exercise program (MCEP) on physical function, cognition, and hemodynamic parameters of elderly normotensive (NTS) and hypertensive (HTS) osteoarthritis patients. A total of 99 elderly osteoarthritis patients (44 NTS and 55 HTS) were recruited and submitted to functional, cognitive, and hemodynamic evaluations before and after six months of a MCEP. The program of exercise was performed twice a week at moderate intensity. The physical exercises aggregated functional and walking exercises. Results indicate that 6 months of MCEP were able to improve one-leg stand and mobility (walking speeds) of osteoarthritis patients regardless of hypertension. On the other hand, cognitive and hemodynamic parameters were not altered after the MCEP. The findings of the present study demonstrate that 6 months of MCEP were able to improve the physical functioning (i.e., usual and maximal walking speed and balance) of osteoarthritis patients regardless of hypertensive condition.
