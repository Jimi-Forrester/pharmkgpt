39654167|a|This study aims to investigate the effect of promethazine (PMZ) on hippocampal neuronal injury through network pharmacology and in vivo experiments. Network pharmacology: The intersection genes of PMZ and Alzheimer Disease (AD) were obtained, and the core genes of PMZ in AD were screened. The intersection genes were enriched by Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses. In the in vitro experiment, mouse hippocampal neurons (HT22) were divided into control, glutamate (GLU) model, and GLU + PMZ treatment groups. The control group was given a complete culture medium, the model group was given GLU for 24 hours, the treatment group was given PMZ pretreatment for 3 hours, and then GLU was administered for 24 hours. Cell viability was determined, cell morphology was observed by microscopy, reactive oxygen species levels and glutathione content were detected, and protein expression of P53, PTGS2, SLC7A11, and GPX4 was detected by western blotting. Network pharmacology: A total of 317 PMZ targets, 1934 AD genes, 125 intersection genes, and 18 core genes, including P53 and PTGS2. Gene Ontology enrichment analysis showed that the effect of PMZ on AD was mainly related to cell proliferation, inflammation, hypoxia, synaptic structure, plasma membrane, and oxidoreductase activity. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes results showed neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, cell senescence, cancer pathway, PI3K-AKT signal pathway, neurodegeneration, and HIF-1 signal pathway. In vitro experiments: PMZ improved the GLU-induced decrease in cell viability and morphological changes in hippocampal neurons. PMZ inhibited reactive oxygen species levels and increased glutathione content in injured hippocampal neurons. Up-regulated of P53, SLC7A11 and GPX4 expression, and inhibited expression of PTGS2. PMZ regulates the SLC7A11-GPX4 antioxidant system to protect hippocampal neurons from oxidative stress injury.
