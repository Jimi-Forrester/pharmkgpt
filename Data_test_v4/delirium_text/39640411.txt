39640411|t|Improving Knowledge About Stroke Using Simulation Training.
39640411|a|Background Stroke is a medical emergency that is risk-stratified using a national scoring system called the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS). The management of an acute stroke necessitates prompt management and swift decision-making. Human factors were identified in the literature as the main rate-limiting step to improving door-to-needle (DTN) time. We felt it would be prudent to design a local stroke course implemented at Great Western Hospital Swindon that incorporates both traditional and simulation-based elements to improve theoretical knowledge and emulate real-life scenarios. The objective of this course was to improve practical application in the efficient assessment and management of stroke patients, as this is critical to delivering timely treatment with thrombolysis or thrombectomy.  Methods Twenty-four medical professionals (medical students and resident doctors) participated in our course between November 2022 and July 2023. The domains assessed included understanding thrombolysis, understanding thrombectomy, confidence in performing NIHSS, and confidence in the assessment of stroke patients. The effectiveness of the stroke simulation course was assessed both quantitatively and qualitatively with pre- and post-course questionnaires. Results There was a significant improvement (p<0.05) in all four assessed domains. There was a significant increase (p=0.0003) in the mean difference of score 3.75 (95% CI: 2.43-5.07) in understanding thrombolysis. Similarly, understanding of thrombectomy was significantly improved (p=0.0002) with a mean difference in score of 3.4 (95% CI: 2.28-4.46). There was also a significant increase (p<0.0001) in confidence in completing NIHSS scoring by a mean of 4.33 (95% CI: 3.55-5.12). Lastly, there was a significant increase (p=0.0012) in the mean by 2.75 (95% CI: 1.51-3.99) in confidence in the assessment of stroke. Overall, 95.8% of the participants found the course at least good, if not very good or excellent, and 91.7% would recommend this course to others. Conclusion We found traditional and simulation-based training to be effective in improving understanding of thrombolysis, understanding of thrombectomy, confidence in NIHSS scoring, and confidence in the assessment of stroke patients. This study validates the effectiveness of our course in improving assessment and management in acute stroke patients. We infer that improvements in these domains coupled with simulation training focused on human factors (e.g., fatigue affecting decision-making or logistical issues such as delays in neuroimaging due to scanner availability) would achieve better DTN time in the participants of our course.
