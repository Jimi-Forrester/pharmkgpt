19742275|t|Post-operative delirium after hip fracture treatment - a review of the current literature.
19742275|a|Delirium is a common accompaniment of physical illness in old age, affecting approximately one out of five of those admitted to medical wards, the number being higher for elderly with fractured femurs. Although its existence has long been recognized its exact pathophysiology has not yet been fully elucidated. The present article presents up-to-date information concerning the etiology, pathophysiology, prevention and treatment of the post-operative delirium after hip-fracture treatment. The fact that its diagnosis remains mainly clinical requiring a high index of suspicion, both from nursing and medical staff, results in important under-recognition of the syndrome. Delirium is a medical emergency and if not promptly and urgently treated, or even better prevented, may have serious consequences for the patient and the family members. Proper measures for its prevention and treatment result in shorter hospital stay of the patients, less financial cost and better surgical outcome and rehabilitation of the elderly patient.
