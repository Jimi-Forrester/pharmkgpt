Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a form of age-related dementia, and loss of cholinergic neurons is intimately associated with development of AD symptoms. We and others have reported that neural cell transplantation ameliorated cognitive dysfunction in AD model mice. It remains largely unclear whether neural cell transplantation ameliorates the NPS of AD. It would be interesting to determine whether NPS correlates with cognitive dysfunctions before and after neural cell transplantation in AD model mice. Based on the revalidation of our previous data from a Morris water maze test, we found that neural cell transplantation improved anxiety and depression significantly and marginally affected locomotion activity in AD mice. A correlation analysis revealed that the spatial learning function of AD mice was correlated with their NPS scores both before and after cell transplantation in a similar manner. In contrast, in the mice subjected to cell transplantation, spatial reference memory function was not correlated with NPS scores. These results suggested the neural cell transplantation in the AD model mice significantly improved NPS to the same degree as cognitive dysfunctions, possibly via distinct mechanisms, such as the cholinergic and GABAergic systems.
