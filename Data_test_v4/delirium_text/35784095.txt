35784095|a|Central nervous system (CNS) injury, induced by ischemic/hemorrhagic or traumatic damage, is one of the most common causes of death and long-term disability worldwide. Reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) resulting in oxidative/nitrosative stress play a critical role in the pathological cascade of molecular events after CNS injury. Therefore, by targeting RONS, antioxidant therapies have been intensively explored in previous studies. However, traditional antioxidants have achieved limited success thus far, and the development of new antioxidants to achieve highly effective RONS modulation in CNS injury still remains a great challenge. With the rapid development of nanotechnology, novel nanomaterials provided promising opportunities to address this challenge. Within these, nanoceria has gained much attention due to its regenerative and excellent RONS elimination capability. To promote its practical application, it is important to know what has been done and what has yet to be done. This review aims to present the opportunities and challenges of nanoceria in treating CNS injury. The physicochemical properties of nanoceria and its interaction with RONS are described. The applications of nanoceria for stroke and neurotrauma treatment are summarized. The possible directions for future application of nanoceria in CNS injury treatment are proposed.
