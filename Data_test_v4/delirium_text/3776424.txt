3776424|a|Thirty-two patients with Alzheimer's disease and affective disturbances were studied. Depressive manifestations were found to be most frequent. In some cases depressive states developed in response to specific psychotraumatizing situations. In the majority of cases the depressions were spontaneous. Sometimes, they were pronounced and ran at the so-called endogenic level even at the stage of full-blown manifestations of the mentally-deteriorating process in the brain. The mere presence of dementia did not prevent the development of marked depressive symptomatology with suicidal tendencies. Deepening of deficient manifestations led to certain changes and simplification of depressive disturbances as well as to their instability. No correlation was revealed between the depth of the senile atrophic process, its rate and severity of affective symptomatology.
