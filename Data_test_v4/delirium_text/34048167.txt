34048167|a|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the quality of life (QoL) amongst Thai nasopharyngeal cancer patients (NCP) and identify associated factors with QoL. METHODS: This study was based on secondary data from a cross-sectional study that aimed to develop the Thai version of functional assessment of cancer therapy with nasopharyngeal cancer subscale demographic data, clinical information of participants, and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy with Nasopharyngeal cancer subscale (FACT-NP) were utilized. Data were analyzed using Student's t-test, rank-sum test, variance analysis, and the Kruskal-Wallis test. Multiple linear regression with the stepwise model was used to determine multiple variable analysis. Statistical significance was defined at p-value < 0.05. RESULTS: Two hundred and thirty NCP were included in the study with a mean age of 50.3+-12.4 years. According to our findings, 68.3% were male, 81.7% were married or living with a partner, and 86.1% were Buddhism had the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status between 0-2 (95.2 %). The employment status, education level, economic status, ECOG, stage , and disease status significantly influenced patients' QoL. Patients who had active treatment and received prophylactic percutaneous gastrostomy  were also impacted by the FACT-NP score. In the multivariate analysis, employment status, ECOG, and disease status were shown to be significant factors that were associated with their QOL in the final model. CONCLUSION: Employment status was a socioeconomic factor that led to positive QOL amongst NCP.
