39609318|a|BACKGROUND: Lithium is our oldest continuously prescribed medication in psychopharmacology, with its history as an agent for treating mood disorders extending from the 19th century. Although clinicians prescribe it less frequently than in the past, its utility in treating bipolar disorder is unquestionable. Novel potential indications for its use in psychiatry have created excitement about broader roles for lithium in treating and preventing other disorders. CONTENT: Lithium is effective both in treating acute mania, as an adjunctive antidepressant, and as a maintenance treatment in bipolar disorder. Lithium has also shown some efficacy in treating and preventing unipolar depression, but less clearly than for bipolar maintenance treatment and acute mania. Common side effects include nausea, polyuria, tremor, weight gain and cognitive dulling. These side effects are typically manageable with reasonable clinical strategies. Lithium affects renal, thyroid and parathyroid function. With clinical monitoring, these effects are easily managed although infrequent cases of severe renal insufficiency may occur with long term use. Although not all studies are positive, a consistent database suggests the efficacy of lithium in decreasing suicide attempts and suicides, likely due to its effect on impulsivity and aggression as well as its prophylaxis against depressive and manic recurrences. Recent data have suggested lithium's potential efficacy for a number of new clinical indications. Lithium's neuroprotective effects suggest potential efficacy in preventing mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia as well as in aiding recovery from strokes. Higher (but still trace) lithium levels in drinking water are associated with lower rates of dementia. It is still not clear how much lithium-and what serum lithium levels- are required for either of these effects. Other preliminary research suggests that lithium may also have antiviral effects and may decrease cancer risk. CONCLUSIONS: Lithium continues to be the mainstay treatment of mood disorders in general and in bipolar disorder specifically. Other potential clinical uses for lithium in psychiatry have re-invigorated excitement for research in other areas such as suicide, preventing cognitive impairment and possibly preventing viral infections and diminishing cancer risk.
