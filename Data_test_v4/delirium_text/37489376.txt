37489376|a|Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a potentially life-threatening, rare acute thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), caused by a severe ADAMTS13 deficiency. As the COVID-19 pandemic rapidly spread around the globe, much data about the pathogenicity of this virus were published. Soon after the detection of the first cases of COVID-19, it was clear that there was a wide range of COVID coagulopathy manifestations, such as deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary thromboembolism, and thrombotic microangiopathies. In the literature, little data have been reported about the association between TTP and COVID-19, and the treatment of COVID-19-associated TTP is still under debate. Here we present the case of a 46-year-old woman who developed a COVID-associated TTP, successfully treated with plasma exchange (PEX), steroids, and caplacizumab.
