10529479|a|Several lines of evidence have implicated the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and its metabolic products as key players in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathophysiology. The approximately 100 amino acid C-terminal fragment (C100) of APP has been shown to accumulate intracellularly in neurons expressing familial AD (FAD) mutants of APP and to cause neurodegeneration when expressed in transfected neuronal cells. Transgenic animals expressing this fragment in the brain also exhibit some neuropathological and behavioral AD-like deficits. Here, we present evidence that PC12 cells expressing the C100 fragment either via stable transfections or herpes simplex virus-mediated infections show alterations in calcium handling that are similar to those previously shown in fibroblasts from AD patients. This alteration in calcium homeostasis may contribute to the deleterious effects of C100 in PC12 cells. Our data also lend support for a pathophysiological role for C100 since it induces an alteration thought to play an important role in AD pathology.
