3692276|a|Several authors have reported reduced levels of pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC)-related peptides in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the mechanisms regulating the CSF content of these substances are still debated. In this case report the processing of POMC peptides has been investigated post-mortem (HPLC and RIA methods) at the pituitary and hypothalamic level in an AD patient and in a control subject. From the results obtained it seems likely that defects of axonal transport and/or secretion rather than synthesis could account for the abnormalities of POMC peptides in the CSF.
