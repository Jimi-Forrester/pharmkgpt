36819638|a|Introduction: Malnutrition could lead to additional medical complications, and the prognostic nutrition index (PNI) is evaluated to assess the nutritional status of patients. However, the midterm postoperative outcomes of malnutrition in patients with adult spinal deformity (ASD) are unclear. This study aims to investigate postoperative midterm spinal alignment and patients' reported outcome measures (PROMs) in malnourished patients with ASD. Methods: This study recruited 303 ASD patients who underwent surgery. Adult patients >=50 years old were categorized into the PNI <50 (L group) and the PNI >=50 (H group) groups. Demographic data, medical complications, mechanical complications, radiographic parameters, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), and Scoliosis Research Society-22 (SRS-22) were analyzed. Results: In this study, 303 patients participated, with 132 and 171 patients in the L and H groups, respectively. Significant differences were noted between the L and H groups in body mass index (22.5 vs. 23.6 kg/m2, p=0.011), autoimmune disease (9.8% vs. 2.3%, p=0.005), and total number of medical complications (47.7% vs. 33.3%, p=0.011). The T1 slope was significantly higher in the L group than in the H group preoperatively (36.5 vs. 32.8 , p=0.042). However, no significant differences were noted in mechanical complications, ODI, SRS-22 scores, or radiographic parameters 2 years postoperatively between the L and H groups, except for the sagittal vertical axis (73.1 vs. 55.7 mm, p=0.014). Conclusions: No significant difference was noted in the incidence of mechanical complications and PROMs 2 years postoperatively. Malnourished status was related to medical complications and global malalignment. However, good surgical outcomes can be expected even for malnourished patients.
