36982725|a|Emerging evidence shows that peripheral systemic inflammation, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), has a close even interaction with central nervous disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study is designed to further clarify the relationship between AD and ulcerative colitis (UC, a subclass of IBD). The GEO database was used to download gene expression profiles for AD (GSE5281) and UC (GSE47908). Bioinformatics analysis included GSEA, KEGG pathway, Gene Ontology (GO), WikiPathways, PPI network, and hub gene identification. After screening the shared genes, qRT-PCR, Western blot, and immunofluorescence were used to verify the reliability of the dataset and further confirm the shared genes. GSEA, KEGG, GO, and WikiPathways suggested that PPARG and NOS2 were identified as shared genes and hub genes by cytoHubba in AD and UC and further validated via qRT-PCR and Western blot. Our work identified PPARG and NOS2 are shared genes of AD and UC. They drive macrophages and microglia heterogeneous polarization, which may be potential targets for treating neural dysfunction induced by systemic inflammation and vice versa.
