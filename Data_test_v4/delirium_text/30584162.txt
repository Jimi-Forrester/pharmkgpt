30584162|a|Our understanding of PD pathophysiology is vastly improved compared to the situation 20 years ago. We have identified the major genetic risks for PD, we now have far more representative animal models of the disease, and we can be inspired by the early successes of others using Antisense Oligonucleotide and vaccination approaches in other neurodegenerative diseases. We also have a broad range of repurposed drugs showing the first signals of potential efficacy in the translational pipeline which are being driven forward through the various clinical trial stages. We believe we can be optimistic that the next 20 years will be a time for major breakthroughs towards the discovery of therapies that may slow, stop, or reverse PD.
