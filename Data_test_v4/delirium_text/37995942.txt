37995942|a|This perspective piece reviews the current training pathways for pediatric consultation-liaison (C-L) psychiatry. Significant workforce shortages of child and adolescent psychiatrists (CAP) over the past three decades have led to the creation of new training pathways between pediatrics and CAP training programs to care for children whose medical and psychiatric management has become increasingly complex. There are now several options available to receive excellent training in pediatric C-L. Efforts to foster continued interactions and shared education between adult and pediatric C-L providers are likely to be beneficial to both disciplines given the astonishing advances in technology over the years that have allowed many patients with complex childhood medical disorders to survive into adulthood today.
