34008421|t|The Role of Cilostazol and Inflammation in Cognitive Impairment After Ischemic Stroke.
34008421|a|PURPOSE: The aim of this study is to examine the potential effect of cilostazol and inflammation on cognitive impairment after stroke in an Asian population. METHODS: Forty-five patients with cognitive impairment after ischemic stroke using cilostazol were enrolled as the study group and 45 patients using aspirin or clopidogrel were enrolled as the control group. Neuropsychiatric assessments were administered at the start of the study and after 6 months. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the association between the cognitive change and cilostazol use. Macrophage polarization were assessed using flow cytometry in 7 patients. RESULTS: There were a significantly higher number of patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease in the cilostazol group. No significant differences were observed in the cognitive change between the cilostazol and control groups. M1 macrophage subset increment were observed in the patient having a declined cognitive change. CONCLUSION: Cilostazol did not make a significant difference in cognitive change after ischemic stroke. M1 macrophage subset increment may indicate post stroke cognitive decline. Due to limited number of subjects, these findings should be examined further in large-scale randomized clinical trials.
