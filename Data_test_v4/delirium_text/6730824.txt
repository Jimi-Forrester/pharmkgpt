6730824|t|[Reactive states in patients with traumatic disease of the brain at remote periods].
6730824|a|Long-term reactive conditions in 100 patients with traumatic cerebral lesions were studied. On the basis of the disease course, the patients were divided into two groups. In 55 cases, psychogenic disorders developed into neuroses, the latter transforming over years into neurosis-like symptomatology, with the growing frequency of vegetative and liquorodynamic impairments and also with increased asthenia. In the case of psychoses development, there was a tendency toward the alleviation of the acuity of every subsequent reactive condition. Such disorders as acute reactive psychoses, reactive depression, delirium-like fantasies showed a progressive tendency to decline, while there was an increase in the incidence of pseudodementia, reactive paranoid and verbal hallucinosis. Conditions contributing to the development of individual types of psychoses are reviewed.
