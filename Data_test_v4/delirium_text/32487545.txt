32487545|t|Roles of polyunsaturated fatty acids, from mediators to membranes.
32487545|a|PUFAs, such as AA and DHA, are recognized as important biomolecules, but understanding their precise roles and modes of action remains challenging. PUFAs are precursors for a plethora of signaling lipids, for which knowledge about synthetic pathways and receptors has accumulated. However, due to their extreme diversity and the ambiguity concerning the identity of their cognate receptors, the roles of PUFA-derived signaling lipids require more investigation. In addition, PUFA functions cannot be explained just as lipid mediator precursors because they are also critical for the regulation of membrane biophysical properties. The presence of PUFAs in membrane lipids also affects the functions of transmembrane proteins and peripheral membrane proteins. Although the roles of PUFAs as membrane lipid building blocks were difficult to analyze, the discovery of lysophospholipid acyltransferases (LPLATs), which are critical for their incorporation, advanced our understanding. Recent studies unveiled how LPLATs affect PUFA levels in membrane lipids, and their genetic manipulation became an excellent strategy to study the roles of PUFA-containing lipids. In this review, we will provide an overview of metabolic pathways regulating PUFAs as lipid mediator precursors and membrane components and update recent progress about their functions. Some issues to be solved for future research will also be discussed.
