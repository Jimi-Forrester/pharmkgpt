35449637|t|A Case of Accidental Isoniazid Overdose Presenting With Nonspecific Symptoms.
35449637|a|A 68-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease and latent tuberculosis on isoniazid (INH), and no psychiatric history presented with a five-day history of anorexia, fatigue, and nausea. Physical exam in the emergency department was notable for somnolence, right upper extremity tremor, and diffuse abdominal pain. Initial workup revealed an anion gap metabolic acidosis with elevated lactate, prompting admission to the general ward for empiric IV antibiotics for suspected bacteremia from his permacath. Within a few hours of admission, he became increasingly encephalopathic and had two episodes of copious hematemesis. Repeat studies revealed a cholestatic pattern of liver injury and new-onset coagulopathy. With an overall clinical picture consistent with fulminant hepatic failure, our pharmacy team initiated a comprehensive pill count of all his medications, which established that he had been inadvertently taking up to six times the recommended dose of INH. With INH discontinuation and supportive therapy, he improved and was discharged on hospital day eight. Our experience provides lessons in the timely recognition and management of this rarely reported toxidrome in the United States.
