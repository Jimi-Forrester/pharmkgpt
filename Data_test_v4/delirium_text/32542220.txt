32542220|t|Let There Be PEACE: Improving Continuous Symptom Monitoring in Hospice Patients.
32542220|a|OBJECTIVE: To ensure that a standardized method of continuous symptom monitoring was available to hospice patients enrolled at our institution. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The Palliative/End-of-Life/Assessment/Care Coordination/Evidence-Based Program (PEACE) seeks to enhance the provision of hospice care through symptom control and patient support. We conducted a quality improvement initiative between November 1, 2015, and March 31, 2017, following Define-Measure-Analyze-Improve-Control methodology to improve hospice care at a rural hospice. The gap in our current hospice model was a standardized method of continuous symptom monitoring. We aimed to explore ways in which technology-assisted care coordination could enhance end-of-life and hospice care. We measured continuous symptom assessments through co-developed condition management protocols (CMPs), technology-assisted care pathways (TACPs), nursing visits, length of stay, respite days, and satisfaction survey data from patients, caregivers, and hospice staff. At baseline, no continuous symptom monitoring was being performed. Baseline data for our enrolled population was compared with data from patients who were eligible, but opted out. RESULTS: We monitored 50 patients using CMP and TACP. The mean +- SD number of skilled nursing visits per patient in the enrolled population compared with those who were eligible but opted out was 13.7+-7.6 vs 14.2+-10.5, respectively. In response to the survey question, "Because of the overall program, I felt supported and confident at home," 74% (37 of 50) of patients and caregivers answered, "always." CONCLUSION: PEACE enhanced hospice care through symptom control and patient support through CMP and TACP. PEACE is a unique and feasible care platform for hospice patients, with high patient and caregiver satisfaction.
