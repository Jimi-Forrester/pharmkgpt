38740308|a|Several proteins play critical roles in vulnerability or resistance to neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Regulation of these proteins is critical to maintaining healthy neurohomeostasis. In addition to transcription factors regulating gene transcription and microRNAs regulating mRNA translation, natural antisense transcripts (NATs) regulate mRNA levels, splicing, and translation. NATs' roles are significant in regulating key protein-coding genes associated with neurodegenerative disorders. Elucidating the functions of these NATs could prove useful in treating or preventing diseases. NAT activity is not restricted to mRNA translation; it can also regulate DNA (de)methylation and other gene expression steps. NATs are noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) encoded by DNA sequences overlapping the pertinent protein genes. These NATs have complex structures, including introns and exons, and therefore bind their target genes, precursor mRNAs (pre-mRNAs), and mature RNAs. They can occur at the 5'- or 3'-ends of a mRNA-coding sequence or internally to a parent gene. NATs can downregulate translation, e.g., microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) antisense-1 gene (MAPT-AS1), or upregulate translation, e.g., beta-Amyloid site Cleaving Enzyme 1 (BACE1) antisense gene (BACE1-AS). Regulation of NATs can parallel pathogenesis, wherein a "pathogenic" NAT (e.g., BACE1-AS) is upregulated under pathogenic conditions, while a "protective" NAT (e.g., MAPT-AS1) is downregulated under pathogenic conditions. As a relatively underexplored endogenous control mechanism of protein expression, NATs may present novel mechanistic targets to prevent or ameliorate aging-related disorders.
