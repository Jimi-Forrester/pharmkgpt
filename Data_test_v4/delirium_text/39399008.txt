39399008|a|Subtle cognitive changes in preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) are difficult to detect using traditional pen-and-paper neuropsychological assessments. Remote and unsupervised digital assessments can improve scalability, measurement reliability, and ecological validity, enabling the detection and monitoring of subtle cognitive change. Here, we evaluate such tools deployed in preclinical AD samples, defined as cognitively unimpaired individuals with abnormal levels of amyloid-beta (Abeta), or Abeta and tau. In this scoping review, we screened 1,680 unique reports for studies using remote and unsupervised cognitive assessment tools in preclinical AD samples; 23 tools were found. We describe each tool's usability, validity, and reported metrics of reliability. Construct and criterion validity according to associations with established neuropsychological assessments and measures of Abeta and tau are reported. With this review, we aim to present a necessary update to a rapidly evolving field, following a previous review by Ohman and colleagues (2021; Alzheimers Dement. Diagn. Assess. Dis. Monit) and addressing the open questions of feasibility and reliability of remote testing in the target population. We discuss future directions for using remote and unsupervised digital cognitive assessments in preclinical AD and how such tools may be used for longitudinal monitoring of cognitive function, scalable case finding, and individualized prognostics in both clinical trials and healthcare contexts.
