31323781|a|Methylene blue (MB) is a synthetic phenothiazine dye that, in the last years, has generated much debate about whether it could be a useful therapeutic drug for tau-related pathologies, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the molecular mechanism of action is far from clear. Recently we reported that MB activates the plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase (PMCA) in membranes from human and pig tissues and from cells cultures, and that it could protect against inactivation of PMCA by amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta). The purpose of the present study is to further examine whether the MB could also modulate the inhibitory effect of tau, another key molecular marker of AD, on PMCA activity. By using kinetic assays in membranes from several tissues and cell cultures, we found that this phenothiazine was able to block and even to completely reverse the inhibitory effect of tau on PMCA. The results of this work point out that MB could mediate the toxic effect of tau related to the deregulation of calcium homeostasis by blocking the impairment of PMCA activity by tau. We then could conclude that MB could interfere with the toxic effects of tau by restoring the function of PMCA pump as a fine tuner of calcium homeostasis.
