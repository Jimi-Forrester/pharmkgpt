31685859|t|alpha-Synuclein oligomers mediate the aberrant form of spike-induced calcium release from IP3 receptor.
31685859|a|Emerging evidence implicates alpha-synuclein oligomers as potential culprits in the pathogenesis of Lewy body disease (LBD). Soluble oligomeric alpha-synuclein accumulation in cytoplasm is believed to modify neuronal activities and intraneural Ca2+ dynamics, which augment the metabolic burden in central neurons vulnerable to LBD, although this hypothesis remains to be fully tested. We evaluated how intracellular alpha-synuclein oligomers affect the neuronal excitabilities and Ca2+ dynamics of pyramidal neurons in neocortical slices from mice. Intracellular application of alpha-synuclein containing stable higher-order oligomers (alphaSNo) significantly reduced spike frequency during current injection, elongated the duration of spike afterhyperpolarization (AHP), and enlarged AHP current charge in comparison with that of alpha-synuclein without higher-order oligomers. This alphaSNo-mediated alteration was triggered by spike-induced Ca2+ release from inositol trisphosphate receptors (IP3R) functionally coupled with L-type Ca2+ channels and SK-type K+ channels. Further electrophysiological and immunochemical observations revealed that alpha-synuclein oligomers greater than 100 kDa were directly associated with calcium-binding protein 1, which is responsible for regulating IP3R gating. They also block Ca2+-dependent inactivation of IP3R, and trigger Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release from IP3R during multiple spikes. This aberrant machinery may result in intraneural Ca2+ dyshomeostasis and may be the molecular basis for the vulnerability of neurons in LBD brains.
