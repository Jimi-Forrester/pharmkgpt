38989931|a|Netrin-1 and its receptors play crucial roles in inducing axonal growth and neuronal migration during neuronal development. Their profound impacts then extend into adulthood to encompass the maintenance of neuronal survival and synaptic function. Increasing amounts of evidence highlight several key points: (1) Diminished Netrin-1 levels exacerbate pathological progression in animal models of Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, and potentially, similar alterations occur in humans. (2) Genetic mutations of Netrin-1 receptors increase an individuals' susceptibility to neurodegenerative disorders. (3) Therapeutic approaches targeting Netrin-1 and its receptors offer the benefits of enhancing memory and motor function. (4) Netrin-1 and its receptors show genetic and epigenetic alterations in a variety of cancers. These findings provide compelling evidence that Netrin-1 and its receptors are crucial targets in neurodegenerative diseases. Through a comprehensive review of Netrin-1 signaling pathways, our objective is to uncover potential therapeutic avenues for neurodegenerative disorders.
