7637586|t|Calbindin D28k mRNA in hippocampus, superior temporal gyrus and cerebellum: comparison between control and Alzheimer disease subjects.
7637586|a|To further investigate the role of calbindin D28k in Alzheimer's disease (AD); hippocampus, superior temporal gyrus and cerebellum from control and AD cases were examined by quantitative in situ hybridization. We report here a decrease in CaBD28k mRNA in the CA2 region of AD hippocampus compared to control subjects. There were no significant differences between AD and control subjects in the other regions studied.
