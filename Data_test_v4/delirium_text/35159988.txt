35159988|t|The Association between Low Levels of Low Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol and Intracerebral Hemorrhage: Cause for Concern?
35159988|a|Excessive levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in the blood are a known risk factor for atherosclerosis, and a common target of treatment for primary and secondary prevention of cerebrocardiovascular disease. As lipid lowering agents including statins, ezetimibe and anti-proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors have shown good therapeutic results, the guidelines are constantly lowering the "optimal" LDL-C goals. However, old and new data point towards an association between low LDL-C and total cholesterol and intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). In this review we aimed to shed light on this troubling association and identify the potential risk factors of such a potential adverse reaction. With respect to the data presented, we concluded that in patients with high risk of ICH, a cautious approach and individualized therapy strategy are advised when considering aggressive LDL reduction.
