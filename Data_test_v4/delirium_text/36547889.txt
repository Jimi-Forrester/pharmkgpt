36547889|t|A Bioactive Substance Derived from Brown Seaweeds: Phlorotannins.
36547889|a|Phlorotannins are a type of natural active substance extracted from brown algae, which belong to a type of important plant polyphenol. Phloroglucinol is the basic unit in its structure. Phlorotannins have a wide range of biological activities, such as antioxidant, antibacterial, antiviral, anti-tumor, anti-hypertensive, hypoglycemic, whitening, anti-allergic and anti-inflammatory, etc. Phlorotannins are mainly used in the fields of medicine, food and cosmetics. This paper reviews the research progress of extraction, separation technology and biological activity of phlorotannins, which will help the scientific community investigate the greater biological significance of phlorotannins.
