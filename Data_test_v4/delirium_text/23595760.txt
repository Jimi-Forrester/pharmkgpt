23595760|t|MER5101, a novel Abeta1-15:DT conjugate vaccine, generates a robust anti-Abeta antibody response and attenuates Abeta pathology and cognitive deficits in APPswe/PS1DeltaE9 transgenic mice.
23595760|a|Active amyloid-beta (Abeta) immunotherapy is under investigation to prevent or treat early Alzheimer's disease (AD). In 2002, a Phase II clinical trial (AN1792) was halted due to meningoencephalitis in ~6% of the AD patients, possibly caused by a T-cell-mediated immunological response. Thus, generating a vaccine that safely generates high anti-Abeta antibody levels in the elderly is required. In this study, MER5101, a novel conjugate of Abeta1-15 peptide (a B-cell epitope fragment) conjugated to an immunogenic carrier protein, diphtheria toxoid (DT), and formulated in a nanoparticular emulsion-based adjuvant, was administered to 10-month-old APPswe/PS1DeltaE9 transgenic (Tg) and wild-type (Wt) mice. High anti-Abeta antibody levels were observed in both vaccinated APPswe/PS1DeltaE9 Tg and Wt mice. Antibody isotypes were mainly IgG1 and IgG2b, suggesting a Th2-biased response. Restimulation of splenocytes with the Abeta1-15:DT conjugate resulted in a strong proliferative response, whereas proliferation was absent after restimulation with Abeta1-15 or Abeta1-40/42 peptides, indicating a cellular immune response against DT while avoiding an Abeta-specific T-cell response. Moreover, significant reductions in cerebral Abeta plaque burden, accompanied by attenuated microglial activation and increased synaptic density, were observed in MER5101-vaccinated APPswe/PS1DeltaE9 Tg mice compared with Tg adjuvant controls. Last, MER5101-immunized APPswe/PS1DeltaE9 Tg mice showed improvement of cognitive deficits in both contextual fear conditioning and the Morris water maze. Our novel, highly immunogenic Abeta conjugate vaccine, MER5101, shows promise for improving Abeta vaccine safety and efficacy and therefore, may be useful for preventing and/or treating early AD.
