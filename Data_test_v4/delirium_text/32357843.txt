32357843|a|BACKGROUND: Encephalopathy is an uncommon but serious presentation of lead toxicity. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine and follow-up the brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) abnormalities in the patients with lead encephalopathy due to ingestion of lead contaminated opium. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study during lead-contaminated opium outbreak, all lead-poisoned patients with any signs/symptoms of encephalopathy were included. RESULTS: Of 19 patients with lead encephalopathy, five died early and other five could not be sent to MRI during their hospitalization period. Mean age was 51 +- 11 years and males were dominant (89%). Median [IQR] blood lead level (BLL) was 101 [81, 108] mug/dL (range; 50 to 200 mug/dL). There was no correlation between MRI findings and signs/symptoms. MRI was normal in six and abnormal in three. Bilateral symmetric involvement of parieto-occipital lobes was observed. Gray matter, gray-white matter junction, and subcortical white matter were also affected. Follow-up MRI was performed in two with abnormal MRI which showed complete and near complete resolution of the abnormalities after cessation of opium use and treatment. CONCLUSION: There was no correlation between MRI findings and BLL. Complete recovery of brain MRI lesions was detected after cessation of opium use.
