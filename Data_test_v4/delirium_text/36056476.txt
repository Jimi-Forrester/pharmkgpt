36056476|t|Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors and the risk of gout in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: A propensity-score-matched, new-user design study with an active comparator using the IQVIA Medical Research Data UK database.
36056476|a|AIM: To conduct a pharmacoepidemiological study to explore the association between sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and gout in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective open cohort study using the IQVIA Medical Research Data UK database was performed between November 1, 2012 and December 31, 2018, estimating the risk of gout in patients with T2DM who were new users of SGLT2 inhibitors, compared to propensity-score-matched new users of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors. RESULTS: A total of 85 incident cases of gout were recorded over 30 389 person-years of observation in 13 617 new users of SGLT2 inhibitors and 29 426 new users of DPP-4 inhibitors. Crude incidence rates (IRs) per 1000 person-years were 2.90 and 2.47 for new users of SGLT2 inhibitors and DPP-4 inhibitors, respectively. The unadjusted hazard ratio (HR) was 1.18 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.76-1.83). The adjusted HR was 1.20 (95% CI 0.77-1.86). In the at-treatment analysis, crude IRs per 1000 person-years were found to be 2.68 and 2.53 for SGLT2 inhibitor and DPP-4 inhibitor users, respectively. In the adjusted model, the adjusted HR was 1.3 (95% CI 0.90-2.29). Sensitivity analyses did not change the findings. CONCLUSIONS: In this nationwide study, no difference in the incidence of gout was documented in patients treated with SGLT2 inhibitors compared to DPP-4 inhibitor users. This neutral finding remained consistent in sensitivity analyses.
