27375478|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the incidence of serious adverse events (SAE) of subthalamic deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) in elderly patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). METHODS: We investigated a group of 26 patients with PD who underwent STN-DBS at mean age 63.2 +- 3.3 years. The operated patients from the EARLYSTIM study (mean age 52.9 +- 6.6) were used as a comparison group. Incidences of SAE were compared between these groups. RESULTS: A higher incidence of psychosis and hallucinations was found in these elderly patients compared to the younger patients in the EARLYSTIM study (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The higher incidence of STN-DBS-related psychiatric complications underscores the need for comprehensive psychiatric pre- and postoperative assessment in older DBS candidates. However, these psychiatric SAE were transient, and the benefits of DBS clearly outweighed its adverse effects.
