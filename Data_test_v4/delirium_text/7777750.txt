7777750|a|The proportion of elderly people in western societies is on the increase. At the same time, demands are being heard for improvements in the quality of health care, including the design of the physical environment. The aim of this study was to call attention to some aspects of colour and the possibilities of using it as an orientational aid for institutionalized demented patients and thereby enhance the quality of their care. A pilot study was carried out to establish whether patients with Alzheimer's disease are different from non-demented patients regarding certain aspects of colour perception. Twelve hospitalized patients with Alzheimer's disease were compared with a matched control group of non-demented patients regarding colour naming, colour discrimination and colour preference. No significant differences were found between the groups. In an additional experiment to test short-term memory it was found that the patients with Alzheimer's disease gained substantial help from colour cues. It is concluded that colour should be taken into account in the designing of the health care environment, particularly geriatric wards.
