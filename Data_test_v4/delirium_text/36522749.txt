36522749|a|BACKGROUND: Understanding the treatment needs of patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is essential to develop treatment strategies. We examined the treatment needs of patients with DLB and their caregivers and the extent to which the attending physicians understand these treatment needs. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional, observational study conducted using questionnaires for patients, caregivers, and physicians. The study participants included patients, their caregivers, and their attending physicians who were experts in DLB. Fifty-two symptoms that are frequent and clinically important in DLB were pre-selected and classified into seven symptom domains. Treatment needs of patients and caregivers were defined as "symptom that causes them most distress," and the frequency of each answer was tabulated. To assess the physician's understanding of the treatment needs of patients and caregivers, patient-physician and caregiver-physician concordance rates for each answer regarding treatment needs were calculated according to symptom domains. RESULTS: In total, 263 pairs of patients-caregivers and 38 physicians were surveyed. The mean age of patients was 79.3 years, and their mean total score on the Mini-Mental State Examination was 20.9. Thirty-five and 38 symptoms were selected as symptoms causing patients and caregivers most distress, respectively. Memory impairment was most frequently selected for the treatment needs of patients, followed by constipation and bradykinesia. Memory impairment was also most frequently selected by caregivers, followed by visual hallucinations. For the symptom domain that causes patients or caregivers most distress, only about half of the patient-physician pairs (46.9%) and caregiver-physician pairs (50.8%) were matched. Logistic regression analysis identified that concordance rates for treatment needs between patient-physician and caregiver-physician were lower when autonomic dysfunction and sleep-related disorders were selected as the symptom domains that cause most distress. CONCLUSION: There was considerable variability in the treatment needs of patients with DLB and their caregivers. Attending physicians had difficulty understanding the top treatment needs of their patients and caregivers, despite their expertise in DLB, because of various clinical manifestations. Attending physicians should pay more attention to autonomic dysfunction and sleep-related disorders in the treatment of DLB. TRIAL REGISTRATION: UMIN Clinical Trials Registry, UMIN000041844.
