35163726|t|Optogenetics for Understanding and Treating Brain Injury: Advances in the Field and Future Prospects.
35163726|a|Optogenetics is emerging as an ideal method for controlling cellular activity. It overcomes some notable shortcomings of conventional methods in the elucidation of neural circuits, promotion of neuroregeneration, prevention of cell death and treatment of neurological disorders, although it is not without its own limitations. In this review, we narratively review the latest research on the improvement and existing challenges of optogenetics, with a particular focus on the field of brain injury, aiming at advancing optogenetics in the study of brain injury and collating the issues that remain. Finally, we review the most current examples of research, applying photostimulation in clinical treatment, and we explore the future prospects of these technologies.
