27631411|a|Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a key regulator of metabolism, cell growth, and protein synthesis. Since decreased mTOR activity has been found to slow aging in many species, the aim of this study was to examine the activity of mTOR and its phosphorylated form in in vitro and in vivo models mimicking Alzheimer's disease (AD), and investigate the potential pathway of PGC-1beta in regulating mTOR expression. Primary neurons and N2a cells were treated with Abeta25-35, while untreated cells served as controls. The expression of mTOR, p-mTOR (Ser2448), and PGC-1beta was determined with Western blotting and RT-PCR assay, and the translocation of mTOR was detected using confocal microscopy. Abeta25-35 treatment stimulated the translocation of mTOR from cytoplasm to nucleus, and resulted in elevated expression of mTOR and p-mTOR (Ser2448) and reduced PGC-1beta expression. In addition, overexpression of PGC-1beta was found to decrease mTOR expression. The results of this study demonstrate that Abeta increases the expression of mTOR and p-mTOR at the site of Ser2448, and the stimulation of Abeta is likely to depend on sirtuin 1, PPARgamma, and PGC-1beta pathway in regulating mTOR expression.
