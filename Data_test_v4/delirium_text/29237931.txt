DATA SOURCES: This review was based on a comprehensive search using online literature databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. STUDY SELECTION: Literature search was based on the following keywords: Alzheimer's disease, tau protein, biomarker, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), therapeutics, plasma, imaging, propagation, spreading, seeding, prion, conformational templating, and posttranslational modification. Relevant articles were carefully reviewed, with no exclusions applied to study design and publication type. RESULTS: Amyloid plaques enriched with extracellular amyloid beta (Abeta) and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles comprised of hyperphosphorylated tau proteins are the two main pathological hallmarks of AD. Although the Abeta hypothesis has dominated AD research for many years, clinical Abeta-targeting strategies have consistently failed to effectively treat AD or prevent AD onset. The research focus in AD has recently shifted to the role of tau in AD. In addition to phosphorylation, tau is acetylated and proteolytically cleaved, which also contribute to its physiological and pathological functions. Emerging evidence characterizing pathological tau propagation and spreading provides new avenues for research into the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying AD pathogenesis. Techniques to detect tau at minute levels in CSF and blood have been developed, and improved tracers have facilitated tau imaging in the brain. These advances have potential to accurately determine tau levels at early diagnostic stages in AD. Given that tau is a potential therapeutic target, anti-tau immunotherapy may potentially be a viable treatment strategy in AD intervention. CONCLUSION: Detecting changes in tau and targeting tau pathology represent a promising lead in the diagnosis and treatment of AD.
