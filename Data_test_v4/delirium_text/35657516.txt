35657516|t|Estimation of the Level of Abasic Sites in Plant mRNA Using Aldehyde Reactive Probe.
35657516|a|Oxidation of RNA is associated with the development of numerous disorders including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), cancer, and diabetes. Additionally, a correlation has been found between increase in RNA oxidation and the process of aging. In plants, elevated level of oxidatively modified transcripts has been detected during alleviation of seeds dormancy and stress response. Increasing interest on the topic of RNA oxidative modifications requires elaboration of new laboratory techniques. So far, the most common method used for the assessment of RNA oxidation is quantification of 8-hydroxyguanine (8-OHG). However, reactive oxygen species (ROS) induce also numerous other changes in nucleic acids, including formation of abasic sites (AP-sites). Recently, the level of AP-sites in RNA has been measured with the use Aldehyde Reactive Probe (ARP). In the present chapter, we describe application of this technique for the evaluation of the level of AP-sites in plant transcripts.
