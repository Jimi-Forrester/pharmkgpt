37733222|a|Two multidimensional problems of recent times - Alzheimer's disease and light pollution - seem to be more interrelated than previously expected. A series of studies in years explore the pathogenesis and the course of Alzheimer's disease, yet the mechanisms underlying this pathology remain not fully discovered and understood. Artificial lights which accompany civilization on a daily basis appear to have more detrimental effects on both environment and human health than previously anticipated. Circadian rhythm is affected by inappropriate lighting conditions in particular. The consequences are dysregulation of the sleep-wake cycle, gene expression, neuronal restructuring, brain's electricity, blood flow, metabolites' turnover, and gut microbiota as well. All these phenomena may contribute to neurodegeneration and consequently Alzheimer's disease. There is an increasing number of research underlining the complexity of the correlation between light pollution and Alzheimer's disease; however, additional studies to enhance the key tenets are required for a better understanding of this relationship.
