36078999|a|Prediction and early detection of delirium can improve patient outcomes. A high blood urea nitrogen to creatinine ratio (BCR), which reflects dehydration, has been reported as a risk factor for delirium. Additionally, BCR represents skeletal muscle loss in intensive care unit (ICU) patients, which can have critical implications for clinical outcomes. We investigated whether BCR could be used to predict the occurrence and motor subtype of delirium in ICU patients through a retrospective cohort study that included 7167 patients (50 years or older) admitted to the ICU. Patients were assessed daily using the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale and the Confusion Assessment Method for ICU and categorized according to the delirium subtype. Participants were split into 10 groups according to BCR at ICU admission and the prevalence of each delirium subtype was compared. Multivariable logistic regression was then used for analysis. A higher BCR at ICU admission was associated with the development of hypoactive delirium. Moreover, BCR > 24.9 was associated with higher rates of hypoactive delirium. Our findings showed that a high BCR at ICU admission was associated with the development of hypoactive delirium, which suggested that BCR could be a potential biomarker for hypoactive delirium in ICU patients.
