35308663|t|Voluntary Age Regression Entering "Headspace" in a Child With Post-traumatic Stress Disorder.
35308663|a|In patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), the use of coping mechanisms seems to correlate with higher levels of resiliency; however, in the age of the internet, patients may find it easier to discover new unhealthy skills that can hinder their treatment and further progress their symptoms. This report describes the case of a 12-year-old female with PTSD who was admitted for suicidal ideation and who presented with age regression that was voluntary in nature, characterized by reverting to the age of a six-year-old girl while her boyfriend took on a parental role for her. These behaviors were learned through her use of social media. This case demonstrates the use of maladaptive behaviors to cope with their trauma and the need for parental supervision on the use of the internet and social media by the younger population.
