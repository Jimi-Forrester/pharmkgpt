27746870|t|The ameliorative potential of ethanolic extract of propolis on hematotoxicity and structural neuronal damage in hyperthermia-exposed rats.
27746870|a|OBJECTIVES: Hyperthermia is one of the most common environmental stressors that affect multi-biological systems in the body including the central nervous system as well as the hematopoietic organs. The objective of the present study was to investigate the protective role of ethanolic extract of propolis (EEP) on some selective stress markers, hematological, biochemical, and histopathological changes in rats subjected to hyperthermia (40  C/12 hr). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The experimental groups (10 rats each) were classified as follows; Group A; control, (C), was kept at a controlled room temperature (25+-5  C). Group B; ethanolic extract of propolis, (EEP), was fed a basal diet supplemented with 3 g EEP/kg diet for 10 days. Group C; heat stress, (HS), was fed a basal diet for 10 days, and then exposed to high temperature (40+-1  C) for 12 hr. Group D; co-exposed, (EEP+HS) was fed a basal diet supplemented with 3 g EEP/kg diet for 10 days, and then subjected to high temperature (40+-1  C) for 12 hr. At the end of the experimental period, animals were decapitated; blood and tissue samples (brain and spleen) were collected for hematological, biochemical, and histopathological examination. RESULTS: EEP at a dose of 3 g/kg diet has a potent protective effect against hematotoxicity and brain damage as well as oxidative stress induced by heat stress in rats. CONCLUSION: The present study indicates that pre-treatment with EEP protects from hematotoxicity and neurological damage induced by high environmental temperature.
