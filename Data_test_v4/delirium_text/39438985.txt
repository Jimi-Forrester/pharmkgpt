39438985|t|Cognitive recovery of post critical care patients with and without COVID-19: differences and similarities, an observational study.
39438985|a|BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients treated in an intensive care unit (ICU) are at high risk of developing cognitive impairments of a "post-intensive care syndrome" (PICS). We explored whether critically ill COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 survivors differ in their post-ICU recovery course in terms of severity and affected cognitive domains. METHODS: An observational prospective study was conducted in a German post-acute neurological early rehabilitation clinic. Critically ill patients with or without SARS-CoV-2 infection (at least mechanically ventilated for one week) underwent repeated standardized assessments during their subsequent inpatient rehabilitation stay. Cognitive functions (information processing speed, learning, recognition, short-term and working-memory, word fluency, flexibility) assigned to different domains (attention, memory, executive functions) were assessed as primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included mental (depression, anxiety) and physical (Barthel index, modified ranking scale) state. RESULTS: Out of 92 eligible patients (screened between June 2021 and August 2023), 34 were examined, and 30 were available for analysis (15 per group). Both groups were ventilated for a similar period (COVID-19 vs. Non-COVID-19: median: 48 vs. 53 days). Patients of COVID-19 group spend on average 10 days longer at ICU and developed slightly more complications, but subsequent inpatient rehabilitation was of comparable duration (median: 36.5 vs. 37 days). On the group-level both groups showed similar cognitive dysfunctions with striking impairments (normative T-scores < 41) in information processing speed, word fluency, flexibility, and recognition memory on admission. Significant gains until discharge were only revealed for information processing speed in both groups (main effect visit, mean difference [95%CI] - 7.5 [- 13.1, - 2.0]). Physical and mental state were also similarly affected in both groups on admission, but improved over time, indicating that overall recovery for higher-order cognitive functions is slowest. Interestingly, majority of patients stated correctly being still physically disabled, while a discrepancy was found between subjective and objective evaluation of cognitive health. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest a substantial overlap of cognitive, mental and physical dysfunction in post-acute recovery of ICU survivors independent of SARS-CoV-2 infection which warrants further monitoring to reduce the risk of long-term burden and enable a return to previous functionality.
