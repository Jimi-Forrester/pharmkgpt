38350389|a|As the largest organ of the body, the skin participates in various physiological activities, such as barrier function, sensory function, and temperature regulation, thereby maintaining the balance between the body and the natural environment. To date, compositional and transcriptional profiles in chicken skin cells have not been reported. Here, we report detailed transcriptome analyses of cell populations present in the skin of a black-feather chicken and a white-feather chicken using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). By analyzing cluster-specific gene expression profiles, we identified 12 cell clusters, and their corresponding cell types were also characterized. Subsequently, we characterized the subpopulations of keratinocytes, myocytes, mesenchymal cells, fibroblasts, and melanocytes. It is worth noting that we have identified a subpopulation of keratinocytes involved in pigment granule capture and a subpopulation of melanocytes involved in pigment granule deposition, both of which have a higher cell abundance in black-feather chicken compared to white-feather chicken. Meanwhile, we also compared the cellular heterogeneity features of Lueyang black-bone chicken skin with different feather colors. In addition, we also screened out 12 genes those could be potential markers of melanocytes. Finally, we validated the specific expression of SGK1, WNT5A, CTSC, TYR, and LAPTM5 in black-feather chicken, which may be the key candidate genes determining the feather color differentiation of Lueyang black-bone chicken. In summary, this study first revealed the transcriptome characteristics of chicken skin cells via scRNA-seq technology. These datasets provide valuable information for the study of avian skin characteristics and have important implications for future poultry breeding.
