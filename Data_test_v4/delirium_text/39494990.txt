39494990|t|Discovering a novel dual specificity tyrosine-phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1A (DYRK1A) inhibitor and its impact on tau phosphorylation and amyloid-beta formation.
39494990|a|Dual-specificity tyrosine-regulated kinase 1 A (DYRK1A) is crucial in neurogenesis, synaptogenesis, and neuronal functions. Its dysregulation is linked to neurodegenerative disorders like Down syndrome and Alzheimer's disease. Although the development of DYRK1A inhibitors has significantly advanced in recent years, the selectivity of these drugs remains a critical challenge, potentially impeding further progress. In this study, we utilised structure-based virtual screening (SBVS) from NCI library to discover novel DYRK1A inhibitors. The top-ranked compounds were then validated through enzymatic assays to assess their efficacy towards DYRK1A. Among them, NSC361563 emerged as a potent and selective DYRK1A inhibitor. It was shown to decrease tau phosphorylation at multiple sites, thereby enhancing tubulin stability. Moreover, NSC361563 diminished the formation of amyloid beta and offered neuroprotective benefits against amyloid beta-induced toxicity. Our research highlights the critical role of selective DYRK1A inhibitors in treating neurodegenerative diseases and presents a promising starting point for the development of targeted therapies.
