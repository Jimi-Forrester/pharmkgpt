26868111|a|The generation of an electroencephalogram (EEG) provides a sensitive, non-invasive and inexpensive method for the investigation of brain function. This article critically reviews the significance of EEG examinations in clinical psychiatric practice and describes relevant applications and limitations. A summary of the basic principles of the production and interpretation of an EEG is followed by a survey of typical EEG patterns in healthy subjects and pathological alterations of EEG patterns. The importance of the EEG for the clinical diagnostics of Alzheimer's disease and acute delirium as well as the differentiation between psychiatric syndromes and non-convulsive status epilepticus is reviewed. Moreover, the usefulness of the EEG is highlighted with respect to the diagnostics and monitoring of the course of lithium intoxication. Finally, this article gives a brief insight into promising research approaches that are currently being followed in modern psychiatry using an EEG.
