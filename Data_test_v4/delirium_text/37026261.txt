37026261|t|Newer approaches to dry eye therapy: Nanotechnology, regenerative medicine, and tissue engineering.
37026261|a|Definitive treatment of dry eye disease (DED), one of the commonest ocular surface disorders, has remained elusive despite several recent advances in better diagnostics and the introduction of newer therapeutic molecules. The current treatment paradigms rely heavily on lubricating eye drops and anti-inflammatory agents that may need to be used long-term and are mainly palliative. Research is ongoing not only for a curative treatment option but also to improve the potency and efficacy of existing drug molecules through better formulations and delivery platforms. In the past two decades, significant advancement has been made in terms of preservative-free formulations, biomaterials such as nanosystems and hydrogels, stem cell therapy, and creation of a bioengineered lacrimal gland. This review comprehensively summarizes the newer approaches to DED treatment, which are biomaterials such as nanosystems, hydrogels, and contact lenses for drug delivery, cell and tissue-based regenerative therapy for damaged lacrimal gland and ocular surface, and tissue engineering for developing artificial lacrimal gland. Also, their potential efficacies in animal models or in vitro studies and possible limitations are discussed. The ongoing research looks promising and needs to be supported with clinical efficacy and safety studies for human use.
