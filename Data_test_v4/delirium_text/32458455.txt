32458455|a|This research work examined and likened effect of eugenol a natural phenolic compound with butylated hydroxylanisole (BHA) and butylated hydroxyl toluene (BHT) synthetic phenolic compounds with key biomolecules [acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), and monoamine oxidase (MAO)] relevant to Alzheimer's diseases (AD) in vitro. Ten millimolar each sample was prepared in a mixture of ethanol and water (1:1 v/v), and the interactions with AChE, BChE, and MAO were evaluated. Still, ferric reducing antioxidant property, ABTS radicals scavenging ability and lipid peroxidation were carried out. The results revealed eugenol, BHT, and BHA inhibited AChE, BChE, and MAO activities dose-dependently. Though, eugenol had greater inhibitory effect against AChE and BChE activities. Also, eugenol demonstrated higher antioxidant potential compared to BHT and BHA. The potent enzymatic inhibitory and antioxidant effects of eugenol indicate eugenol could be promising as an alternative food additive and neuromodulator in AD management. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: BHT and BHA are synthetic antioxidant employed industrially as food preservative. BHT and BHA are employed in food packaging, drugs, and cosmetics. Although BHT and BHA are widely in use but have been found were associated with alteration in sleeping, induced changes in brain serotonin and norepinephrine levels with increased cholinesterase activity. Endocrine disrupting effects, reproductive disorder is more side effects associated with the use of BHT and BHA. However, eugenol a natural compound found in plants compares favorably with BHT and BHA as antioxidant with many more health promoting benefits such as neuroprotective effects, antiapoptotic effects, and prevent aluminum toxicity. Eugenol being a natural antioxidant with no side effects showing more promising effects over the synthetic phenolic compounds and could be an alternative for the BHT and BHA.
