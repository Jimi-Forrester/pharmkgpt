15865577|t|Management of delirium: a clinical governance approach.
15865577|a|This study assessed the management of delirium in the Acute Care of the Elderly unit (ACE) at a tertiary referral hospital as a case study of the application of clinical governance principles. The environment was found to be supportive of ongoing clinical governance activities, both in clinical organisation of work processes and orientation of management. However, patient involvement, dissemination and use of clinical pathways, performance measurement and feedback, and maintaining stability of care are areas requiring further development. Although there is a clinical governance strategy in place at the policy level, this has not always filtered through to the level of clinical work.
