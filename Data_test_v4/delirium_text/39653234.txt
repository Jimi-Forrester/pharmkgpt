39653234|t|Role of miRNA regulation in IGFBP-2 overexpression and neuronal ferroptosis: Insights into the Nrf2/SLC7A11/GPX4 pathway in Alzheimer's disease.
39653234|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disease with pathological features including amyloid plaque deposits and neurofibrillary tangles. In this study, the expressions of miRNA, IGFBP-2 and neuronal ferritin were detected by qPCR, Western blot and immunohistochemistry. The regulatory effects of miRNA on IGFBP-2 and neuronal ferritin were further verified by intervention experiments with miRNA mimics and inhibitors. Double luciferase reporter gene assay and RNA immunoprecipitation were used to investigate the interaction between miRNA and target genes. Finally, the effect of miRNA on Nrf2/SLC7A11/GPX4 pathway was evaluated by antioxidant enzyme activity and oxidative stress marker detection. The overexpression of IGFBP-2 was found to be significantly increased with the deposition of neuronal ferritin. Expression levels of specific mirnas were significantly down-regulated in AD models and negatively correlated with IGFBP-2 and neuronal ferritin expression. Intervention experiments with miRNA mimics and inhibitors have confirmed that these mirnas can regulate the expression of IGFBP-2 and neuronal ferritin. Further studies revealed that these mirnas affect antioxidant enzyme activity and oxidative stress levels by targeting key genes in the Nrf2/SLC7A11/GPX4 pathway, thereby regulating the deposition of neuronal ferritin.
