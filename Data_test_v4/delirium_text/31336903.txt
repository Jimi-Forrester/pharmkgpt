31336903|t|PPARs as Nuclear Receptors for Nutrient and Energy Metabolism.
31336903|a|It has been more than 36 years since peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) were first recognized as enhancers of peroxisome proliferation. Consequently, many studies in different fields have illustrated that PPARs are nuclear receptors that participate in nutrient and energy metabolism and regulate cellular and whole-body energy homeostasis during lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, cell growth, cancer development, and so on. With increasing challenges to human health, PPARs have attracted much attention for their ability to ameliorate metabolic syndromes. In our previous studies, we found that the complex functions of PPARs may be used as future targets in obesity and atherosclerosis treatments. Here, we review three types of PPARs that play overlapping but distinct roles in nutrient and energy metabolism during different metabolic states and in different organs. Furthermore, research has emerged showing that PPARs also play many other roles in inflammation, central nervous system-related diseases, and cancer. Increasingly, drug development has been based on the use of several selective PPARs as modulators to diminish the adverse effects of the PPAR agonists previously used in clinical practice. In conclusion, the complex roles of PPARs in metabolic networks keep these factors in the forefront of research because it is hoped that they will have potential therapeutic effects in future applications.
