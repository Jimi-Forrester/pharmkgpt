36139251|t|Evaluation of the Fecal Proteome in Healthy and Diseased Cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus) Suffering from Gastrointestinal Disorders.
36139251|a|Fecal proteomics allows for the identification of proteins and peptides present in stools and is useful in finding possible new biomarkers for diagnosing and/or monitoring gastrointestinal (GI) disorders. In the present study, we investigated the fecal proteome in healthy and diseased cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus). Captive individuals of this species frequently show gastrointestinal disorders characterized by recurrent episodes of diarrhea, rare episodes of vomiting and weight loss, associated with Helicobacter spp. infection. Fecal proteomic evaluation has been performed by two-dimensional electrophoresis followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. In healthy cheetahs, the results showed the presence of the following proteins: collagen alpha-1 (II) chain, transthyretin, IgG Fc-binding protein, titin, dystonin, isopentenyl-diphosphate Delta-isomerase 1, sodium/potassium-transporting ATPase subunit alpha-1 and protein disulfide-isomerase A6. The presence of albumin isoforms was found only in diseased cheetahs. The present paper reports the study of the fecal proteome in the cheetah, evidences some differences between healthy and diseased patients and confirms, once again, the potential of fecal proteomics for the study of the GI environment, with promising developments regarding the identification of new diagnostic/monitoring markers.
