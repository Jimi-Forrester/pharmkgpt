39000382|t|Genetic and Epigenetic Biomarkers Linking Alzheimer's Disease and Age-Related Macular Degeneration.
39000382|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) represents a prominent neurodegenerative disorder (NDD), accounting for the majority of dementia cases worldwide. In addition to memory deficits, individuals with AD also experience alterations in the visual system. As the retina is an extension of the central nervous system (CNS), the loss in retinal ganglion cells manifests clinically as decreased visual acuity, narrowed visual field, and reduced contrast sensitivity. Among the extensively studied retinal disorders, age-related macular degeneration (AMD) shares numerous aging processes and risk factors with NDDs such as cognitive impairment that occurs in AD. Histopathological investigations have revealed similarities in pathological deposits found in the retina and brain of patients with AD and AMD. Cellular aging processes demonstrate similar associations with organelles and signaling pathways in retinal and brain tissues. Despite these similarities, there are distinct genetic backgrounds underlying these diseases. This review comprehensively explores the genetic similarities and differences between AMD and AD. The purpose of this review is to discuss the parallels and differences between AMD and AD in terms of pathophysiology, genetics, and epigenetics.
