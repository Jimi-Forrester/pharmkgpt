31920204|t|Current Evidence-Based Practice for Pediatric Emergence Agitation.
31920204|a|This article provides a systematic review of pediatric emergence agitation, also known as emergence delirium. Major topics of this review include the incidence, risk factors, and impact of the phenomenon, in addition to current evidence-based strategies for prevention of pediatric emergence agitation. Emergence agitation causes tremendous psychological distress for the patient, family, and healthcare providers, as well as concerns for physical safety. Risk factors for pediatric emergence agitation are the child's age, genetic profile, length and type of surgical procedure, and use of inhalational anesthesia. In an attempt to prevent this problem, anesthesia providers should consider these factors and possible interventions when implementing an anesthetic plan. Evidence-based interventions that may decrease the incidence of pediatric emergence agitation include technology, familial involvement, pharmacologic adjuncts, and alternative methods of general anesthesia.
