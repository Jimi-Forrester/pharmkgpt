443469|t|Massive benzodiazepine requirements during acute alcohol withdrawal.
443469|a|Severe alcohol withdrawal developed in an abstinent chronic alcoholic man. Massive doses of benzodiazepines (2,335 mg of diazepam intravenously, 21,225 mg of oxazepam orally) achieved only marginal control of delirium and agitation. Analysis of multiple blood samples drawn during and after the withdrawal episode indicated, as expected, very high concentrations of diazepam and metabolites and of oxazepam. There was no evidence of an abnormal pharmacokinetic profile. Benzodiazepine resistance in withdrawing alcoholics probably reflects a receptor-site phenomenon rather than an abnormal drug disposition.
