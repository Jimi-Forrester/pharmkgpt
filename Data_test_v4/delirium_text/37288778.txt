37288778|t|Caring from a distance: Experiences of Polish immigrants in the United States providing care to parents with dementia overseas.
37288778|a|OBJECTIVES: Aging populations and an increasing number of immigrants in recent years have led to numerous changes in intergenerational relationships. While many studies have investigated the impact of providing care to a parent with dementia, little is known about the impact of caregiving activities provided from a distance, such as in the case of immigration, and over a long period of time to a person with dementia. Our understanding of how transnational caregiving for a person with dementia impacts relationships is also limited. Using the Intergenerational Solidarity Theory (IST) as a theoretical framework, this paper examines the experiences of adult children immigrant caregivers of a parent with dementia living in Poland. METHOD: A qualitative, semi-structured interview was conducted with thirty-seven caregivers living in the U.S. while providing transnational care to a parent with Alzheimer's disease or other form of dementia. The data analysis was based on the thematic analysis strategy. RESULTS: Four themes were identified: (1) filial obligations and solidarity, (2) caregivers' contradictory emotions regarding transnational care, (3) financial and emotional exhaustion, and (4) challenges of nursing home dilemmas. DISCUSSION: Transnational caregivers represent a unique group who face distinctive challenges related to competing demands and limited resources. This study contributes to a better understanding of their experiences while the findings highlight the importance of addressing the mental and physical well-being of immigrant caregivers of individuals with dementia and have important implications for healthcare professionals and immigration policies. Implications for future research were also identified.
