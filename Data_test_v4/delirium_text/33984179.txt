33984179|a|Quality of life and health utility are important outcomes for patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and central for demonstrating the value of new treatments. Estimates in biomarker-confirmed AD populations are missing, potentially delaying payer approval of treatment. We examined whether health utility, assessed with the EuroQoL-5 3-level version (EQ-5D-3L), differed between individuals with a positive or negative amyloid beta (Abeta) biomarker in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and cognitively unimpaired (CU) participants from the Swedish BioFINDER study (n = 578). Participants with prodromal AD (Abeta-positive MCI) reported better health utility (n = 79, mean = 0.81, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.77-0.85) than Abeta-negative MCI (mean = 0.71, 95% CI 0.64-0.78), but worse than controls (Abeta-negative CU, mean = 0.87, 95% CI 0.86-0.89). Health utility in preclinical AD (Abeta-positive CU; mean = 0.86, 95% CI 0.83-0.89) was similar to controls. This relatively good health utility in prodromal AD suggests a larger value of delaying progression to dementia than previously anticipated and a great value of delaying clinical progression in preclinical AD.
