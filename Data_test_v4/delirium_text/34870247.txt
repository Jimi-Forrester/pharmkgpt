34870247|a|Due to the infection by the SARS-CoV-2 virus (COVID-19) there were also reported neurological symptoms, being the most frequent and best cited those that affect the cerebrovascular, sensorial, cognitive and motor functions, together with the neurological diffuse symptoms as for examples headache or dizziness. Besides, some of them behave high risk of mortality. Consequently, it is crucial to elucidate the mechanisms of action in brain of SARS-CoV-2 virus in order to create new therapeutic targets to fight against this new disease. Since now the mechanisms of arrival to the brain seems to be related with the following processes: blood brain barrier (BBB) disruption together with nervous or axonal transport of the virus by the trigeminal nerve, the vagus nerve, or the brain-gut-axis. Being two the mechanisms of brain affectation most cited: a direct affectation of the virus in the brain through neuroinvasion and an indirect mechanism of action due to the effects of the systemic infection. Both processes include the triggering of inflammation, hypoxia and the increased likelihood of secondary infections. This topic supposes a major novel challenge for neuroscience. Therefore, the aim of this review is to provide summarized information about the neurological symptomatology and the brain pathogenic mechanisms involved and reported in COVID-19.
