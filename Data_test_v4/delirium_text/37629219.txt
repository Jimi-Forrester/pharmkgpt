37629219|t|Involvement of APOE in Incidence of Revascularization in Patients Affected by Peripheral Arterial Disease: A Prospective Study from Southern Italy.
37629219|a|INTRODUCTION: Atherosclerosis is a complex multifactorial disease and apolipoprotein E (APOE) polymorphism has been associated with cardiovascular events. The APOE gene, located on chromosome 19q13.2, has an important role in lipid metabolism, in particular on circulating cholesterol levels, implying further pleiotropic effects; from its polymorphism are derived three alleles (epsilon2, epsilon3 and epsilon4), which induce different phenotypes, while its impact on carotid and femoral atherosclerosis is still controversial. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study is to investigate the relationship between APOE genotypes and peripheral revascularization in a cohort of patients affected by advanced peripheral arterial disease (PAD) at a prolonged follow-up. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Some 332 patients (259 males and 73 females; mean age 70.86 +- 7.95 years) with severe PAD were enrolled in a longitudinal study, with a 90.75 +- 32.25 month follow-up, assessing major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). RESULTS: As compared with epsilon3/epsilon3, in epsilon4 patients we observed a significant higher incidence of carotid (13.2% vs. 5.6%; HR = 2.485, 95% CI 1.062-5.814; p = 0.036) and lower limb (11.8% vs. 4.3%; HR = 2.765, 95% CI 1.091-7.008; p = 0.032) revascularizations and, accordingly, a higher incidence of total peripheral revascularizations (13.5% vs. 9.5%; HR = 2.705, 95% CI 1.420-5.151; p = 0.002). HR remained statistically significant even when adjusted for classic cardiovascular risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: In our observational study, we confirm that the epsilon4 allele is associated with higher total peripheral revascularization in patients with advanced atherosclerotic vascular disease at prolonged follow-up.
