39624494|t|Correlation between fall experience and life functions among community-dwelling older adults in Japan.
39624494|a|Purpose: This study investigated the correlation between the risk of falls and life functions, including motor function, cognitive function, and urinary disorders, among older adults residing in small cities in the metropolitan areas of Japan and evaluated the contents of fall prevention instructions. Methods: Sixty-nine older adults residing at home participated in this case-control study conducted between September and October 2019. The survey items included questions pertaining to the history of falls; grip strength; the 30-s Chair Stand Test (CS-30), Functional Reach Test (FRT), and Timed Up and Go Test (TUG) scores; mental and cognitive functions [Test Your Memory-Japanese version test (TYM-J)]; living conditions; and urination status [Core Lower Urinary Tract Symptom Score (CLSS)]. Results: Participants with a history of falls had significantly lower CS-30 and FRT scores, and significantly higher TUG scores and CLSS than those with no history of falls. Grip strength bore significant correlations with the CS-30 and TUG scores. The CS-30 scores were correlated with the FRT and TUG scores. The FRT scores were correlated with the TUG and French State Activity Index (FAI) scores. The TUG scores were correlated with the TYM-J and FAI scores. The CLSS showed no significant correlations with the remaining items. The FRT scores and CLSS exerted a significant effect on the risk of experiencing falls. Conclusion: Both balancing ability and micturition status affect fall risk and should be considered in treatment strategies for urinary disorders in fall prevention programs for older adults.
