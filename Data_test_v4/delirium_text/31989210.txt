31989210|a|BACKGROUND: The development of delirium in patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD) is a feared complication, which is often associated with sustained worsening of motor symptoms and psychopathological sequelae. Little is known regarding the prevalence and incidence rates, course and prognosis. Clinical studies from which recommendations for evidence-based management of delirium in IPD can be derived are lacking. OBJECTIVE: To summarize the state of the art regarding epidemiological and clinical features of delirium in IPD. Discussion of prevention strategies and non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatment options. METHODS: A literature search was carried out in PubMed. RESULTS: The IPD is an independent risk factor for the development of delirium. Patients with IPD show poorer clinical outcome frequently with cognitive worsening and motor complications following development of delirium. CONCLUSION: So far no validated rating scales for recognition and course evaluation of delirium in IPD are available. Preventive strategies and non-pharmacological measures should be consistently implemented to improve management. There are insufficient data concerning pharmacotherapy with quetiapine and clozapine, whereas other neuroleptics are contraindicated for delirium in IPD due to antidopaminergic side effects.
