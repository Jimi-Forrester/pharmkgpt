32603732|a|Known as a main neural MAP (microtubule associated protein), tau protein contributes to stabilizing microtubules involved in cellular transmission. Tau dysfunction is mainly associated with neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD). In these patients, all the six tau isoforms, which are in hyperphosphorylated form, are first aggregated and then polymerized into neurofibrillary tangles inside the brain. Tau protein detected in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is significantly correlated with AD and is well recognized as a hallmark of the disease. Served for detection of analytes of interest, biosensor device comprises a physical transducer and a keen biological recognition component. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations may be performed through analyzation of the data, which is gathered by measurable signals converted from biological reaction. Antibodies, receptors, microorganisms, nucleic acids, enzymes, cells and tissues, as well as some biomimetic structures, normally constitute the biosensor biological recognition part. Production of nanobiosensor, which was made possible through several accomplishments in nano- and fabrication technology, opens up new biotechnological horizons in diagnosis of multiple diseases. In recent years, many researches have been focused on developing novel and effective tau protein biosensors for rapid and accurate detection of AD. In this review, tau protein function and correlation with AD as well as the eminent research on developing nanobiosensor based on optical, electrochemical and piezoelectric approaches will be highlighted.
