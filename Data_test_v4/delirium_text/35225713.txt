35225713|t|Psychotherapy: A tool to prevent postoperative delirium?
35225713|a|The value of psychotherapy in surgical patients suffering from postoperative delirium is unclear. Options for the treatment of established postoperative delirium are few; therapy largely relies on the avoidance of postoperative delirium facilitating factors, like specific drugs and environmental factors in the perioperative setting. Established medical therapies' efficacy in terms of decreasing incidence of postoperative delirium is very low. The aim of this project is to suggest new therapeutic options in the form of cognitive behavioural therapy as a possible preventive and psychotherapeutic treatment of postoperative delirium. Life expectancy in developed countries increases worldwide and both the need for surgical treatment and the probability of postoperative delirium occurrence increase with age. Due to the necessity of addressing the individual's negative consequences of postoperative delirium and to optimise socioeconomical needs, new therapeutic options for the treatment of postoperative delirium are desperately needed.
