35977540|t|The Role of the Gut Microbiome in Diet and Exercise Effects on Cognition: A Review of the Intervention Literature.
35977540|a|Interest in the gut-brain axis and its implications for neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and related dementias, is growing. Microbial imbalances in the gastrointestinal tract, which are associated with impaired cognition, may represent a therapeutic target for lowering dementia risk. Multicomponent lifestyle interventions are a promising dementia risk reduction strategy and most often include diet and exercise, behaviors that are also known to modulate the gut microbiome. A better understanding of the role of the gut microbiome in diet and exercise effects on cognition may help to optimize these lifestyle interventions. The purpose of this review is to summarize findings from diet and exercise interventions that have investigated cognitive changes via effects on the microbiome. We aim to discuss the underlying mechanisms, highlight current gaps in the field, and provide new research directions. There is evidence mainly from rodent studies supporting the notion that microbiota changes mediate the effects of diet and exercise on cognition, with potential mechanisms including end-product metabolites and regulation of local and systemic inflammation. The field lacks whole diet and exercise interventions, especially those involving human participants. It is further limited by heterogeneous rodent models, outcome assessments, and the absence of proper mediation analyses. Trials including older adults with dementia risk factors, factorial designs of diet and exercise, and pre and post measures of microbiota, end-product metabolites, and inflammation would help to elucidate and potentially leverage the role of the microbiome in lowering dementia risk through lifestyle modification.
