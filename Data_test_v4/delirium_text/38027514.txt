38027514|t|Advancing the interfacing performances of chronically implantable neural probes in the era of CMOS neuroelectronics.
38027514|a|Tissue penetrating microelectrode neural probes can record electrophysiological brain signals at resolutions down to single neurons, making them invaluable tools for neuroscience research and Brain-Computer-Interfaces (BCIs). The known gradual decrease of their electrical interfacing performances in chronic settings, however, remains a major challenge. A key factor leading to such decay is Foreign Body Reaction (FBR), which is the cascade of biological responses that occurs in the brain in the presence of a tissue damaging artificial device. Interestingly, the recent adoption of Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) technology to realize implantable neural probes capable of monitoring hundreds to thousands of neurons simultaneously, may open new opportunities to face the FBR challenge. Indeed, this shift from passive Micro Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) to active CMOS neural probe technologies creates important, yet unexplored, opportunities to tune probe features such as the mechanical properties of the probe, its layout, size, and surface physicochemical properties, to minimize tissue damage and consequently FBR. Here, we will first review relevant literature on FBR to provide a better understanding of the processes and sources underlying this tissue response. Methods to assess FBR will be described, including conventional approaches based on the imaging of biomarkers, and more recent transcriptomics technologies. Then, we will consider emerging opportunities offered by the features of CMOS probes. Finally, we will describe a prototypical neural probe that may meet the needs for advancing clinical BCIs, and we propose axial insertion force as a potential metric to assess the influence of probe features on acute tissue damage and to control the implantation procedure to minimize iatrogenic injury and subsequent FBR.
