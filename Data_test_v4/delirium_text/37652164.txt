37652164|t|Crosstalk between NLRP3 inflammasome and calpain in Alzheimer's disease.
37652164|a|Amyloid plaques are considered to be the pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Neuroinflammation further aggravates the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Calpains and NOD-like receptor protein-3 (NLRP3) inflammasomes are involved in the neuroinflammatory pathway and affect the progression of Alzheimer's disease. Hyperactivation of calpains is responsible for the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome, thereby affecting each other's molecular mechanism and causing astrogliosis, microgliosis, and neuronal dysfunction. Further, calpain hyperactivation is also associated with calcium homeostasis that acts as one of the triggers in the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. Calpain activity is required for the maturation of interleukin-1beta, a key mediator of neuroinflammatory responses. The membrane potential/calcium/calpain/caspase-1 axis acts as an unconventional regulator of inflammasomes. The complex crosstalk between NLRP3 inflammasome and calpain leads to a series of events. Targeting the molecular mechanism associated with calpain-NLRP3 inflammasome activation and regulation can be a therapeutic and prophylactic perspective towards Alzheimer's disease. This review discusses calpains and NLRP3 inflammasome crosstalk in the pathogenesis of AD.
