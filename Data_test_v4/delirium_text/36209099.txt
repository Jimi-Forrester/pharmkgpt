36209099|a|Microglia are immune-competent cells that are critically involved in maintaining normal brain function. A prominent characteristic of Alzheimer disease (AD) is microglial proliferation and activation concentrated around amyloid plaques in the brain. Recent research has revealed numerous microglial phenotypes related to aging and AD, apart from the traditional M1 and M2 types. Redox signalling modulates the acquisition of the classical or alternative microglia activation phenotypes. The numerous microglial functions can be achieved through these multiple phenotypes, which are associated with distinct molecular signatures.
