11356507|t|New insights into progressive supranuclear palsy.
11356507|a|Increased oxidative damage and mitochondrial dysfunction have been suggested to play crucial roles in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. In this review, we will focus on progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), a rare parkinsonian disorder with tau pathology. Particular emphasis is placed on the genetic and biochemical data that has emerged, offering new perspectives into the pathogenesis of this devastating disease, especially the contributory roles of oxidative damage and mitochondrial dysfunction.
