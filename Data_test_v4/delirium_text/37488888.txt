37488888|t|Physiological and pathological functions of circular RNAs in the nervous system.
37488888|a|Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a class of covalently closed single-stranded RNAs that are expressed during the development of specific cells and tissues. CircRNAs play crucial roles in physiological and pathological processes by sponging microRNAs, modulating gene transcription, controlling the activity of certain RNA-binding proteins, and producing functional peptides. A key focus of research at present is the functionality of circRNAs in the nervous system and several advances have emerged over the last 2 years. However, the precise role of circRNAs in the nervous system has yet to be comprehensively reviewed. In this review, we first summarize the recently described roles of circRNAs in brain development, maturity, and aging. Then, we focus on the involvement of circRNAs in various diseases of the central nervous system, such as brain cancer, chronic neurodegenerative diseases, acute injuries of the nervous system, and neuropathic pain. A better understanding of the functionality of circRNAs will help us to develop potential diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic strategies to treat diseases of the nervous system.
