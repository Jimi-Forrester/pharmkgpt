26658197|a|As the population of the world is rapidly ageing, the amount of surgery being performed in older patients is also increasing. Special attention is required for the anaesthetic and perioperative management of these patients. The clinical and non-clinical issues specific to older surgical patients are reviewed, with a special emphasis on areas of debate related to anaesthesia care in this group. These issues include the role of frailty and disability in preoperative assessment, choice of anaesthesia technique for hip fracture, postoperative delirium, and approaches to shared decision-making before surgical procedures.
