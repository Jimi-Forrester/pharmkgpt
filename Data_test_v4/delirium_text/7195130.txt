7195130|a|Thin-layer chromatographic examinations of blood lipids and phospholipids were carried out in 28 patients with delirium tremens (at the height of the psychosis) treated and not treated with hemodes. The results of the examination were compared with those obtained from a control group of 17 healthy subjects. The examinations revealed marked disturbances of lipid metabolism at the peak of the psychosis that manifested themselves in a drop of the concentrations of all fractions determined. It was found that despite the intensification of the therapy these disturbances often continued to progress during the first 24 hours of the treatment, and only the use of hemodes contributed to normalization of many biochemical processes. This allows one to regard hemodes as a lipotropic agent active at the level of cell membranes and favouring the elimination of basic pathogenetic factors of delirium tremens.
