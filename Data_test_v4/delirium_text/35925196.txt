35925196|t|Virtual reality in preoperative preparation of children undergoing general anesthesia: a randomized controlled study.
35925196|a|BACKGROUND: Preoperative anxiety can cause hyperalgesia, postoperative delirium and other adverse events, and even long-term psychological disorders. The aim of this trial was to determine whether preoperative virtual reality (VR) preparation reduces anxiety prior to induction of anesthesia. METHODS: Data were analyzed for 99 children undergoing elective surgery. Participants were randomly assigned to a VR exposure intervention group or a control group. In the VR group, children watched a VR video showing a realistic interactive immersive virtual version of the perioperative process. The control group received conventional preoperative preparation. Preoperative anxiety using the modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scale-Short Form (mYPAS-SF) during anesthesia induction was the main outcome. Secondary outcomes included induction compliance, emergence delirium, pain, and parental satisfaction. RESULTS: The VR group had lower mYPAS-SF scores when leaving the waiting area (27.1, interquartile range, IQR 22.9-33.3 vs. 33.3, IQR 27.1-39.6; P = 0.006), and during anesthesia induction (29.2, IQR 22.9-33.3 vs. 39.6, IQR 33.3-55.2; P = 9x10-6). The Induction Compliance Checklist (ICC) scores during anesthesia induction were lower in the VR group (0.0, IQR 0.0-0.0 vs. 1.0, IQR 0.0-1.0; P = 0.003) than the control group, while parental satisfaction in the VR group was higher. CONCLUSION: Virtual reality exposure as a preparation tool has a beneficial effect on anxiety, induction compliance and parental satisfaction in children undergoing elective surgery.
