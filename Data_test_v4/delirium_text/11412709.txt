11412709|a|The term alpha-synucleinopathy is used to name a group of disorders having in common the abnormal deposition of alpha-synuclein in the cytoplasm of neurons or glial cells, as well as in extracellular deposits of amyloid. In Parkinson's disease and Lewy body dementia, alpha-synuclein is the main component of Lewy bodies and dystrophic neurites; alpha-synuclein also accumulates in the cytoplasm of glial cells. In multiple system atrophy, alpha-synuclein conforms the cytoplasmic oligodendroglial inclusions and the neuronal inclusions which are the hallmark of this disease. Finally, the amyloidogenic fragment 61-95 amino acids of alpha-synuclein is the non-Abeta component of senile plaque amyloid in Alzheimer disease. Accumulations of alpha-synuclein in all these disorders have in common a fibrilar configuration, but they differ in the binding of alpha-synuclein to distinct proteins with the exception of ubiquitin whose binding to alpha-synuclein is common to all alpha-synuclein inclusions. The mechanisms leading to alpha-synuclein fragmentation and aggegation into extracellular amyloid are not known, although alpha-synuclein fragment and betaA4 aggregates are the result of abnormal cleavage of large precursors. On the other hand, several studies have shown that alpha-synuclein may adopt a fibrilar conformation and give rise to insoluble forms and high molecular weight aggregates in vitro. Similar complexes have also been observed in alpha-synucleinopathies. Although studies in vitro and in vivo have shown toxic effects of alpha-synuclein, the consequence of alpha-synuclein deposition on cell survival in alpha-synucleinopathies is not known.
