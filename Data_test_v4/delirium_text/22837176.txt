22837176|a|Populations of healthy older individuals are often highly heterogeneous, as prevalence of various underlying pathologies increases with age. Finding coherent groups of normal older adults may allow to identify subpopulations that are at risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this paper, we propose an approach that utilizes longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data to obtain natural groupings of older adult subjects via an unsupervised (i.e., clustering) technique. We develop a k-medoids-like clustering algorithm that simultaneously finds clusters of longitudinal images, as well as weights brain regions in such a way that the obtained clusters are maximally coherent. We propose a cluster-based measure that reflects the individual subject's cognitive decline. The proposed method is unsupervised and is suitable for analyzing AD at its very early stages.
