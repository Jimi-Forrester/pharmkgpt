32271856|t|The orphan nuclear receptor TLX: an emerging master regulator of cross-talk between microglia and neural precursor cells.
32271856|a|Neuroinflammation and neurogenesis have both been the subject of intensive investigation over the past 20 years. The sheer complexity of their regulation and their ubiquity in various states of health and disease have sometimes obscured the progress that has been made in unraveling their mechanisms and regulation. A recent study by Kozareva et al. (Neuronal Signaling (2019) 3), provides evidence that the orphan nuclear receptor TLX is central to communication between microglia and neural precursor cells and could help us understand how inflammation, mediated by microglia, influences the development of new neurons in the adult hippocampus. Here, we put recent studies on TLX into the context of what is known about adult neurogenesis and microglial activation in the brain, along with the many hints that these processes must be inter-related.
