8317270|t|Alzheimer's disease--immunological aspects.
8317270|a|Alzheimer's Disease (A.D.) is a multifarious, complex syndrome, which probably comprises different etiopathogenic subunits. Work by several authors has shown immunological disturbances in A.D. underlining the importance of immunological imbalance in the explanation of the etiopathogenesis and progress of some forms of A.D. An early diagnosis of A.D. is important because changes in central nervous system respond well to immunomodulatory treatment in the early course of disease. This justifies a search for diagnostic methods permitting an early diagnosis of the disease and establishment of immunological disturbances and consequently an early start of treatment. In the present paper, the literature regarding immunological disturbances observed in A.D. patients is reviewed.
