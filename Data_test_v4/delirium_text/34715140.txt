34715140|a|AIMS: Stem cell-based therapy is one of the promising strategies in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the short lifespan and low homing of transplanted cells continue to be a major obstacle in this method. Preconditioning of stem cells before transplantation could increase cell therapy efficiency. Herein, we examined whether the treatment of stem cells with deferoxamine (DEF) prior to graft could enhance the neuroprotective effects of stem cells in the streptozotocin (STZ)-treated male rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: After induction of the AD model, the rats were transplanted with DEF-preconditioned Adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AMSCs) or untreated cells. Memory function, antioxidant capacity, cell density, and homing of transplanted cells were assessed using Morris water maze and shuttle box tasks as well as biochemical and histochemical methods. KEY FINDINGS: Transplantation of AMSCs caused a memory improvement when compared to the AD model. The injection of DEF-preconditioned AMSCs was more effective in improving learning and memory than the untreated cells through an increase in the antioxidant capacity. Moreover, the homing of transplanted cells was higher in the rats that received the preconditioned cells than that of the naive cell-injected group. SIGNIFICANCE: It seems that the transplantation of DEF-treated cells may increase the efficiency of stem cells via an increase in the antioxidant capacity.
