37662038|a|Background: Hearing can be impaired in many neurological conditions and can even represent a forme fruste of specific disorders. Auditory function can be measured by either subjective or objective tests. Objective tests are more useful in identifying which auditory pathway (superior or inferior) is most affected by disease. The inner ear's perilymphatic fluid communicates with the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) via the cochlear aqueduct representing a window from which pathological changes in the contents of the CSF due to brain inflammation could, therefore, spread to and cause inflammation in the inner ear, damaging inner hair cells and leading to hearing impairment identifiable on tests of auditory function. Methods: A systematic review of the literature was performed, searching for papers with case-control studies that analyzed the hearing and migraine function in patients with neuro-inflammatory, neurodegenerative disorders. With data extracted from these papers, the risk of patients with neurological distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) was then calculated. Results: Patients with neurological disorders (headache, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis) had a higher risk of having peripheral auditory deficits when compared to healthy individuals. Conclusion: Existing data lend credence to the hypothesis that inflammatory mediators transmitted via fluid exchange across this communication window, thereby represents a key pathobiological mechanism capable of culminating in hearing disturbances associated with neuroimmunological and neuroinflammatory disorders of the nervous system.
