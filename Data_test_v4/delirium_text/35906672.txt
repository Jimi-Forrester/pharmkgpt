35906672|a|BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by a polyglutamine expansion in the ataxin-1 protein. The pathogenic mechanism resulting in SCA1 is still unclear. Protein-protein interactions affect the function and stability of ataxin-1. METHODS: Wild-type and mutant ataxin-1 were expressed in HEK-293T cells. The levels of expression were assessed using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Western blots. Co-immunoprecipitation was done in HEK-293T cells expressing exogenous wild-type and mutant ataxin-1 using anti-Flag antibody following by tandem affinity purification in order to study protein-protein interactions. The candidate interacting proteins were validated by immunoprecipitation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and high-throughput sequencing and RNA immunoprecipitation and high-throughput sequencing were performed using HEK-293T cells expressing wild-type or mutant ataxin-1. RESULTS: In this study using HEK-293T cells, we found that wild-type ataxin-1 interacted with MCM2, GNAS, and TMEM206, while mutant ataxin-1 lost its interaction with MCM2, GNAS, and TMEM206. Two ataxin-1 binding targets containing the core GGAG or AAAT were identified in HEK-293T cells using ChIP-seq. Gene Ontology analysis of the top ataxin-1 binding genes identified SLC6A15, NTF3, KCNC3, and DNAJC6 as functional genes in neurons in vitro. Ataxin-1 also was identified as an RNA-binding protein in HEK-293T cells using RIP-seq, but the polyglutamine expansion in the ataxin-1 had no direct effects on the RNA-binding activity of ataxin-1. CONCLUSIONS: An expanded polyglutamine tract in ataxin-1 might interfere with protein-protein or protein-DNA interactions but had little effect on protein-RNA interactions. This study suggested that the dysfunction of protein-protein or protein-DNA interactions is involved in the pathogenesis of SCA1.
