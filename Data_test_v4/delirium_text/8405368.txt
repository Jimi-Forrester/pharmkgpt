8405368|t|An interaction of beta-amyloid with aluminium in vitro.
8405368|a|We have used circular dichroism spectroscopy to confirm that, in a membrane-mimicking solvent, A beta P(1-40) adopts a partially helical conformation and we have demonstrated the loss of this structure in the presence of physiologically relevant concentrations of aluminium. This is the first evidence of a direct biochemical interaction between aluminium and beta-amyloid and may have important implications for the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.
