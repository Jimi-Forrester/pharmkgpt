30555513|t|The Epigenetics of Alzheimer's Disease: Factors and Therapeutic Implications.
30555513|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a well-known neurodegenerative disorder that imposes a great burden on the world. The mechanisms of AD are not yet fully understood. Current insight into the role of epigenetics in the mechanism of AD focuses on DNA methylation, remodeling of chromatin, histone modifications and non-coding RNA regulation. This review summarizes the current state of knowledge regarding the role of epigenetics in AD and the possibilities for epigenetically based therapeutics. The general conclusion is that epigenetic mechanisms play a variety of crucial roles in the development of AD, and there are a number of viable possibilities for treatments based on modulating these effects, but significant advances in knowledge and technology will be needed to move these treatments from the bench to the bedside.
