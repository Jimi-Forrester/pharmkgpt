37815905|t|PNA5, A Novel Mas Receptor Agonist, Improves Neurovascular and Blood-Brain-Barrier Function in a Mouse Model of Vascular Cognitive Impairment and Dementia.
37815905|a|It is well established that decreased brain blood flow, increased reactive oxygen species production (ROS), and pro-inflammatory mechanisms accelerate neurodegenerative disease progressions, including vascular cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID). Previous studies in our laboratory have shown that our novel glycosylated Angiotensin-(1-7) Mas receptor agonist PNA5 reverses cognitive deficits, decreases ROS production, and inhibits inflammatory cytokine production in our preclinical mouse model of VCID that is induced by chronic heart failure (VCID-HF). In the present study, the effects of VCID-HF and treatment with PNA5 on microglia activation, blood-brain-barrier (BBB) integrity, and neurovascular coupling were assessed in our mouse model of VCID-HF. Three-month-old male C57BL/6J mice were subjected to myocardial infarction (MI) to induce heart failure for four weeks and then treated with subcutaneous injections of extended-release PNA5. Microglia activation, BBB permeability, cerebral perfusion, and neurovascular coupling were assessed. Results show that in our VCID-HF model, there was an increase in microglial activation and recruitment within the CA1 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus, a disruption in BBB integrity, and a decrease in neurovascular coupling. Treatment with PNA5 reversed these neuropathological effects of VCID-HF, suggesting that PNA5 may be an effective disease-modifying therapy to treat and prevent VCID. This study identifies potential mechanisms by which heart failure may induce VCID and highlights the possible mechanisms by which treatment with our novel glycosylated Angiotensin-(1-7) Mas receptor agonist, PNA5, may protect cognitive function in our model of VCID.
