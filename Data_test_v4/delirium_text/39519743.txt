39519743|a|The gut microbiota metabolizes flavonoids, amino acids, dietary fiber, and other components of foods to produce a variety of gut microbiota-derived metabolites. Flavonoids are the largest group of polyphenols, and approximately 7000 flavonoids have been identified. A variety of phenolic acids are produced from flavonoids and amino acids through metabolic processes by the gut microbiota. Furthermore, these phenolic acids are easily absorbed. Phenolic acids generally represent phenolic compounds with one carboxylic acid group. Gut microbiota-derived phenolic acids have antiviral effects against several viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2 and influenza. Furthermore, phenolic acids influence the immune system by inhibiting the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. In the nervous systems, phenolic acids may have protective effects against neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Moreover, phenolic acids can improve levels of blood glucose, cholesterols, and triglycerides. Phenolic acids also improve cardiovascular functions, such as blood pressure and atherosclerotic lesions. This review focuses on the current knowledge of the effects of phenolic acids produced from food-derived flavonoids and amino acids by the gut microbiota on health and disease.
