8835883|a|Preliminary to a multicenter trial, an open-label study was conducted of prednisone treatment in Alzheimer's disease. Prednisone was given at an initial dose of 10 mg (part 1) or 20 mg (part 2) and tapered over 7 weeks. There were no serious adverse events attributed to the medication, and there were no significant changes in either mean cognitive or behavioral assessment scores with treatment during either part. Serum levels of the acute phase proteins alpha-1-antichymotrypsin and C-reactive protein did not change significantly during part 1, but were suppressed by the higher dose given in part 2. Thus, a prednisone regimen with an initial dose of 20 mg is tolerable and results in suppression of the acute phase response in Alzheimer's disease.
