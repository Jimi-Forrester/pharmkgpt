37240443|t|"ThermoTRP" Channel Expression in Cancers: Implications for Diagnosis and Prognosis (Practical Approach by a Pathologist).
37240443|a|Temperature-sensitive transient receptor potential (TRP) channels (so-called "thermoTRPs") are multifunctional signaling molecules with important roles in cell growth and differentiation. Several "thermoTRP" channels show altered expression in cancers, though it is unclear if this is a cause or consequence of the disease. Regardless of the underlying pathology, this altered expression may potentially be used for cancer diagnosis and prognostication. "ThermoTRP" expression may distinguish between benign and malignant lesions. For example, TRPV1 is expressed in benign gastric mucosa, but is absent in gastric adenocarcinoma. TRPV1 is also expressed both in normal urothelia and non-invasive papillary urothelial carcinoma, but no TRPV1 expression has been seen in invasive urothelial carcinoma. "ThermoTRP" expression can also be used to predict clinical outcomes. For instance, in prostate cancer, TRPM8 expression predicts aggressive behavior with early metastatic disease. Furthermore, TRPV1 expression can dissect a subset of pulmonary adenocarcinoma patients with bad prognosis and resistance to a number of commonly used chemotherapeutic agents. This review will explore the current state of this rapidly evolving field with special emphasis on immunostains that can already be added to the armoire of diagnostic pathologists.
