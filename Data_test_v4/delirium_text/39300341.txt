39300341|a|BACKGROUND: Effective interventions for overall healthy subjects with mild cognitive impairment are currently limited. Choline alphoscerate (alpha glyceryl phosphorylcholine, alphaGPC) is a choline-containing phospholipid used to treat cognitive function impairments in specific neurological conditions. This study aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of alphaGPC in individuals diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment. METHODS: In this multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, 100 study subjects with mild cognitive impairment underwent a double-blind SHCog  soft capsule (600 mg alphaGPC) or placebo treatment for 12 weeks. The primary efficacy outcome included changes from baseline on the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog). Safety assessments included regular monitoring of adverse events, and clinical laboratory tests were conducted at baseline and the end of the trial. RESULTS: After 12 weeks of alphaGPC treatment, the ADAS-cog score decreased by 2.34 points, which was significantly greater than the change observed in the placebo group. No serious AEs were reported, and no study subjects discontinued the intervention because of AEs. There was no significant difference in incidence rate of AEs between the alphaGPC group and the placebo group. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that alphaGPC is a safe and effective intervention for improving cognitive function in study subjects with mild cognitive impairment.
