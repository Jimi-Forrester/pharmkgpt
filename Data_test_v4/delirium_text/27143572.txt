27143572|t|Family Caregiving and the Site of Care: Four Narratives About End-of-Life Care for Individuals with Dementia.
27143572|a|Little is known about end-of-life care for individuals with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. Four case studies are presented, using data collected by qualitative interviews conducted with family caregivers who were closely involved with end-of-life care for relatives with dementia. The case studies are formatted in two pairs, with one reflecting two deaths occurring at home and the other pair representing two deaths in the nursing home. The cases reveal a range of end-of-life experiences, suggesting that there is not just one "good" path. The extent of care needed, the responsiveness of the individual, the health of the caregiver(s), and the residence and support situations, can all intersect in a variety of ways that make no one scenario the answer for all. Although most people say they would prefer to die at home, in some situations the nursing home can be a satisfactory choice, particularly if hospice is involved. These narrative case studies give the reader insight into the variety of the end-of-life experiences and suggest the environment should be considered as part of the care provision.
