33705794|a|Adult mammalian astrocytes are sensitive to inflammatory stimuli in the context of neuropathology or mechanical injury, thereby affecting functional outcomes of the central nervous system (CNS). In contrast, glial cells residing in the spinal cord of regenerative vertebrates exhibit a weak astroglial reaction similar to those of mammals in embryonic stages. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) participates in multiple neurological disorders by activation of glial and immune cells. However, the mechanism of astrocytes from regenerative species, such as gecko astrocytes (gAS), in resistance to MIF-mediated inflammation in the severed cords remains unclear. Here, we compared neural stem cell markers among gAS, as well as adult (rAS) and embryonic (eAS) rat astrocytes. We observed that gAS retained an immature phenotype resembling rat eAS. Proinflammatory activation of gAS with gecko (gMIF) or rat (rMIF) recombinant protein was unable to induce the production of inflammatory cytokines, despite its interaction with membrane CD74 receptor. Using cross-species screening of inflammation-related mediators from models of gMIF- and rMIF-induced gAS and rAS, we identified Vav1 as a key regulator in suppressing the inflammatory activation of gAS. The gAS with Vav1 deficiency displayed significantly restored sensitivity to inflammatory stimuli. Meanwhile, gMIF acts to promote the migration of gAS through regulation of CXCL8 following cord lesion. Taken together, our results suggest that Vav1 contributes to the regulation of astrocyte-mediated inflammation, which might be beneficial for the therapeutic development of neurological diseases.
