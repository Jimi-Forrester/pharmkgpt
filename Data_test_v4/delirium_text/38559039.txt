38559039|t|Open-Source Tools to Analyze Temporal and Spatial Properties of Local Field Potentials.
38559039|a|Analysis of local field potentials (LFPs) is important for understanding how ensemble neurons function as a network in a specific region of the brain. Despite the availability of tools for analyzing LFP data, there are some missing features such as analysis of high frequency oscillations (HFOs) and spatial properties. In addition, accessibility of most tools is restricted due to closed source code and/or high costs. To overcome these issues, we have developed two freely available tools that make temporal and spatial analysis of LFP data easily accessible. The first tool, hfoGUI (High Frequency Oscillation Graphical User Interface), allows temporal analysis of LFP data and scoring of HFOs such as ripples and fast ripples which are important in understanding memory function and neurological disorders. To complement the temporal analysis tool, a second tool, SSM (Spatial Spectral Mapper), focuses on the spatial analysis of LFP data. The SSM tool maps the spectral power of LFPs as a function of subject's position in a given environment allowing investigation of spatial properties of LFP signal. Both hfoGUI and SSM are open-source tools that have unique features not offered by any currently available tools, and allow visualization and spatio-temporal analysis of LFP data.
