31520500|t|Factors predictive of the presence of a CSF1R mutation in patients with leukoencephalopathy.
31520500|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The purpose was to identify statistically factors that correlate with the presence of a colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) mutation and to reevaluate the accuracy of the current diagnostic criteria for CSF1R-related leukoencephalopathy. METHODS: CSF1R testing was conducted on 145 consecutive leukoencephalopathy cases who were clinically suspected of having adult-onset leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids and pigmented glia. From these, 135 cases whose detailed clinical information was available were enrolled. Forward logistic stepwise regression was performed to generate a probability model to predict a positive CSF1R mutation result. The current diagnostic criteria were also applied to our cohort and their sensitivity and specificity were calculated. RESULTS: Twenty-eight CSF1R-mutation-positive cases and 107 CSF1R-mutation-negative cases were identified. Our probability model suggested that factors raising the probability of a CSF1R-mutation-positive result were younger onset, parkinsonism, thinning of the corpus callosum and diffusion-restricted lesions. It also showed that involuntary movements and brainstem or cerebellar atrophy were negative predictors of a CSF1R-mutation-positive result. In our cohort, the sensitivity and specificity for 'probable' or 'possible' CSF1R-related leukoencephalopathy were 81% and 14%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical and brain imaging features predictive of the presence of a CSF1R mutation are proposed. Consideration of these factors will help prioritize patients for CSF1R testing.
