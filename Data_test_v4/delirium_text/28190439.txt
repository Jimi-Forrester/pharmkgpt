28190439|t|Neurologic complications of polytrauma.
28190439|a|Neurologic complications in polytrauma can be classified by etiology and clinical manifestations: neurovascular, delirium, and spinal or neuromuscular problems. Neurovascular complications include ischemic strokes, intracranial hemorrhage, or the development of traumatic arteriovenous fistulae. Delirium and encephalopathy have a reported incidence of 67-92% in mechanically ventilated polytrauma patients. Causes include sedation, analgesia/pain, medications, sleep deprivation, postoperative state, toxic ingestions, withdrawal syndromes, organ system dysfunction, electrolyte/metabolic abnormalities, and infections. Rapid identification and treatment of the underlying cause are imperative. Benzodiazepines increase the risk of delirium, and alternative agents are preferred sedatives. Pharmacologic treatment of agitated delirium can be achieved with antipsychotics. Nonconvulsive seizures and status epilepticus are not uncommon in surgical/trauma intensive care unit (ICU) patients, require electroencephalography for diagnosis, and need timely management. Spinal cord ischemia is a known complication in patients with traumatic aortic dissections or blunt aortic injury requiring surgery. Thoracic endovascular aortic repair has reduced the paralysis rate. Neuromuscular complications include nerve and plexus injuries, and ICU-acquired weakness. In polytrauma, the neurologic examination is often confounded by pain, sedation, mechanical ventilation, and distracting injuries. Regular sedation pauses for examination and maintaining a high index of suspicion for neurologic complications are warranted, particularly because early diagnosis and management can improve outcomes.
