25614117|a|To discover multifunctional agents for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a series of scutellarein carbamate derivatives were designed and synthesized based on the multitarget-directed ligand strategy. Their acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase inhibitory activities, antioxidant activities, metal-chelating properties and neuroprotective effects against hydrogen peroxide induced PC12 cell injury were evaluated in vitro. The results showed that most of the synthetic compounds exhibited good multifunctional activities. In particular, compound 15c exhibited dual inhibitory potency on acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase with IC50 values of 0.57 and 22.6muM, respectively, and good antioxidative activity, with a value 1.3-fold of Trolox. In addition, 15c acted as a selective biometal chelator and possessed neuroprotective effects. Furthermore, 15c could cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in vitro and had significant neuroprotective effects in scopolamine-induced cognitive impairment in mice. Taken together, these results suggest that compound 15c might be a potential multifunctional agent for the treatment of AD.
