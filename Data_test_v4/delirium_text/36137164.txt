36137164|a|PURPOSE: To assess the effect of continuous ketamine administration in patients admitted to medical and cardiac intensive care units (ICUs) and received mechanical ventilation support. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study between March 2012 and June 2020 at an academy-affiliated tertiary hospital. Adult patients who received mechanical ventilation support for over 24 h and continuous ketamine infusion for at least 8 h were included. The primary outcome was immediate hemodynamic safety after continuous ketamine infusion. The secondary outcomes included immediate delirium, pain, and use of sedation. RESULTS: Of all 12,534 medical and cardiac ICU patients, 564 were eligible for the analysis. Ketamine was used for 33.3 (19.0-67.5) h and the median continuous infusion dose was 0.11 (0.06-0.23) mcg/kg/h. Of all patients, 469 (83.2%) received continuous ketamine infusion concomitant with analgosedation. Blood pressure and vasopressor inotropic scores did not change after continuous ketamine infusion. Heart rate decreased significantly from 106.9 (91.4-120.9) at 8 h before ketamine initiation to 99.8% (83.9-114.4) at 24 h after ketamine initiation. In addition, the respiratory rate decreased from 21.7 (18.6-25.4) at 8 h before ketamine initiation to 20.1 (17.0-23.0) at 24 h after ketamine initiation. Overall opioid usage was significantly reduced: 3.0 (0.0-6.0) mcg/kg/h as fentanyl equivalent dose at 8 h before ketamine initiation to 1.0 (0.0-4.1) mcg/kg/h as fentanyl equivalent dose at 24 h post-ketamine initiation. However, the use of sedatives and antipsychotic medications did not decrease. In addition, ketamine did not increase the incidence of delirium within 24 h after ketamine infusion. CONCLUSION: Ketamine may be a safe and feasible analgesic for medical and cardiac ICU patients who received mechanical ventilation support as an opioid-sparing agent without adverse hemodynamic effects.
