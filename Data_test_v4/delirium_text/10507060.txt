10507060|a|Given the increasing evidence of oxidative stress in AD brain and studies from different perspectives that appear to show a converging, central role for A beta in the pathogenesis and etiology of AD, insight into A beta-associated free radical oxidative stress will likely lead to a greater understanding of AD and, potentially, to better therapeutic strategies in this disorder. This article outlined methods to investigate markers of oxidative stress induced by A beta in brain membrane systems. Especially important are markers for protein oxidation, lipid peroxidation, and ROS generation by A beta. Oxidative stress and its sequelae are likely related to both necrotic and apoptotic mechanisms of neurotoxicity, and A beta-associated free radical oxidative stress may be of fundamental importance in Alzheimer's disease etiology and pathogenesis. The methods described here provide some means for investigating this possibility.
