37190492|a|The literature has long established the association between aging and frailty, with emerging evidence pointing to a relationship between frailty and SARS-CoV-2 contagion. The possible neurological consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection, associated with physical and cognitive frailty, could lead to a worsening of Parkinson's disease (PD) in infected patients or-more rarely-to an increase in the Parkinsonian symptomatology. A possible link between those clinical pictures could be identified in vitamin D deficiency, while the whole process would appear to be associated with alterations in the microbiota-intestine-brain axis that fall within the alpha-Synuclein Origin site and Connectome (SOC) model, and allow for the identification of a body-first PD and a brain-first PD. The model of care for this condition must consider intrinsic and extrinsic variables so that care by a multidisciplinary team can be successfully predicted. A multidimensional screening protocol specifically designed to identify people at risk or in the early stages of the disease should begin with the investigation of indices of frailty and microbiota-intestine-brain axis alterations, with a new focus on cases of hypovitaminosis D.
