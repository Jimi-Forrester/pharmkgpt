Foremost among these is Alzheimer's disease (AD), the foremost cause of dementia in older adults. The shortage of efficacious therapies and early diagnostic indicators underscores the imperative to identify non-invasive biomarkers for early detection and disease monitoring. Recently, blood metabolites have emerged as promising candidates for AD biomarkers. METHODS: Leveraging nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy on plasma specimens, we conducted a cross-sectional study encompassing 35 AD patients and 35 age-matched healthy controls. Cognitive function was evaluated using the mini-mental state examination in all participants, followed by peripheral blood sample collection. We utilized univariate and multivariate analyses to perform targeted lipidomic profiling via NMR spectroscopy. RESULTS: Our study revealed significant differences in the expression profiles of low-density lipoprotein-associated subfractions in females and high-density lipoprotein-associated subfractions in males between AD patients and healthy controls (all p<0.05). However, there was no significant metabolite overlap between males and females. Furthermore, receiver operating characteristic curve analysis demonstrated that the combination of lipid metabolites had good diagnostic values (all area under the curve>0.70; p<0.05). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the blood plasma samples using NMR hold promise in distinguishing between AD patients and healthy controls, with significant clinical implications for advancing AD diagnostic methodologies.
