36344783|a|Human serum paraoxonase-1 (PON-1) is a critical antioxidant defence system against lipid oxidation. Decreased PON-1 activity has been associated with systemic oxidative stress in several disease states. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of plasma/serum concentrations of PON-1 in asthma, a chronic inflammatory airway disease. The electronic databases PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus and Google Scholar were searched from inception to February 2022. In total, 8 studies in 355 asthmatic patients and 289 healthy controls were included in the meta-analysis. Serum PON-1 concentrations were significantly lower in asthmatic patients (SMD = -1.58, 95% CI -2.53 to -0.63; p = 0.001). The pooled SMD values were not substantially altered in sensitivity analysis. There was no publication bias. There were non-significant differences in PON-1 concentrations in patients with severe vs. mild-to-moderate asthma (SMD =  - 0.39, 95% CI - 1.00 to 0.22, p = 0.21). Our meta-analysis has shown that serum PON-1 concentrations are significantly lower in patients with asthma, suggesting the presence of an impaired antioxidant defense in this group.
