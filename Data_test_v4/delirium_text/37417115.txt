37417115|a|Purpose: To describe the demographics and clinical profile of pseudoexfoliation syndrome (PXF or PES) in patients presenting to a multi-tier ophthalmology hospital network in India. Methods: This cross-sectional hospital-based study included 3,082,727 new patients presenting between August 2010 and December 2021. Patients with a clinical diagnosis of PXF in at least one eye were included as cases. The data were collected using an electronic medical record system. Results: Overall, 23,223 (0.75%) patients were diagnosed with PXF. The majority of the patients were male (67.08%) and had unilateral (60.96%) affliction. The most common age group at presentation was during the seventh decade of life with 9,495 (40.89%) patients. The overall prevalence was higher in patients from a lower socio-economic status (1.48%) presenting from the urban geography (0.84%) and in retired individuals (3.61%). The most common location of the PXF material was the pupillary margin (81.01%) followed by the iris (19.15%). The majority of the eyes had mild or no visual impairment (<20/70) in 12,962 (40.14%) eyes. PXF glaucoma was documented in 7,954 (24.63%) eyes. Krukenberg's spindle was found in 64 (0.20%) eyes, phacodonesis in 328 (1.02%) eyes, and lens subluxation in 299 (0.93%) eyes. Among the surgical interventions, cataract surgery was performed in 8,363 (25.9%) eyes, trabeculectomy was performed in 966 (2.99%) eyes, and a combined procedure in 822 (2.55%) eyes. Conclusion: PXF more commonly affects males presenting during the seventh decade of life from lower socio-economic status and is predominantly unilateral. A quarter of the affected eyes are associated with glaucoma and the majority of the eyes have mild or no visual impairment.
