36982809|t|Erythrocytes Functionality in SARS-CoV-2 Infection: Potential Link with Alzheimer's Disease.
36982809|a|Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a rapidly spreading acute respiratory infection caused by SARS-CoV-2. The pathogenesis of the disease remains unclear. Recently, several hypotheses have emerged to explain the mechanism of interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and erythrocytes, and its negative effect on the oxygen-transport function that depends on erythrocyte metabolism, which is responsible for hemoglobin-oxygen affinity (Hb-O2 affinity). In clinical settings, the modulators of the Hb-O2 affinity are not currently measured to assess tissue oxygenation, thereby providing inadequate evaluation of erythrocyte dysfunction in the integrated oxygen-transport system. To discover more about hypoxemia/hypoxia in COVID-19 patients, this review highlights the need for further investigation of the relationship between biochemical aberrations in erythrocytes and oxygen-transport efficiency. Furthermore, patients with severe COVID-19 experience symptoms similar to Alzheimer's, suggesting that their brains have been altered in ways that increase the likelihood of Alzheimer's. Mindful of the partly assessed role of structural, metabolic abnormalities that underlie erythrocyte dysfunction in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), we further summarize the available data showing that COVID-19 neurocognitive impairments most probably share similar patterns with known mechanisms of brain dysfunctions in AD. Identification of parameters responsible for erythrocyte function that vary under SARS-CoV-2 may contribute to the search for additional components of progressive and irreversible failure in the integrated oxygen-transport system leading to tissue hypoperfusion. This is particularly relevant for the older generation who experience age-related disorders of erythrocyte metabolism and are prone to AD, and provide an opportunity for new personalized therapies to control this deadly infection.
