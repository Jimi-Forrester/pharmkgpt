38858735|t|A comprehensive exploration of astrocytes in migraine: a bibliometric and visual analysis.
38858735|a|BACKGROUND: Migraine, as a prevalent neurologic disorder, involves intricate and yet incompletely elucidated pathophysiological mechanisms. A plethora of research findings underscores the pivotal role played by astrocytes in the progression of migraines. In order to elucidate the current advances and directions in research pertaining to astrocytes in migraines, we conducted bibliometric analysis of relevant literature and visualized the results. Subsequently, we expound upon these findings to contribute to the evolving understanding of the role of astrocytes in migraine pathophysiology. METHODS: On November 21, 2023, we conducted a search on Web of Science (WOS), restricting the document type to articles or reviews and language to English. Following a meticulous selection process involving three researchers, we identified the literature to be included in our analysis. Subsequently, we employed Microsoft Office Excel programs, R, VOSviewer, Scimago Graphica, and CiteSpace software to conduct visualization analysis of basic information and trends regarding journals, countries/regions, and influential authors, institutions, keywords, and papers. RESULTS: As of November 21, 2023, relevant literature has been published in 71 journals across 27 countries/regions. This corpus comprises contributions from 576 authors affiliated with 220 institutions, encompassing 865 keywords and referencing 6065 scholarly articles. CEPHALALGIA stands out as the most influential journal in this field, while authors PIETROBON D and DALKARA T have significant impact. The United States is highly influential, with CNR and UNIV PADUA emerging as highly influential institutions. The predominant category is Neurosciences. CONCLUSIONS: Future investigators may continue to focus on migraines with aura, familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM), and the crucial calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) system. Employing advanced observational techniques, such as imaging, researchers should pay attention to cellular and tissue structures, such as microglia and the trigeminal ganglion, as well as mechanisms involving inflammation and central sensitization. Moreover, animal models are paramount in obtaining high-quality evidence.
