36776763|t|Neural stem/progenitor cell-derived extracellular vesicles: A novel therapy for neurological diseases and beyond.
36776763|a|As bilayer lipid membrane vesicles secreted by neural stem/progenitor cells (NSCs), NSC-derived extracellular vesicles (NSC-EVs) have attracted growing attention for their promising potential to serve as novel therapeutic agents in treatment of neurological diseases due to their unique physicochemical characteristics and biological functions. NSC-EVs exhibit advantages such as stable physical and chemical properties, low immunogenicity, and high penetration capacity to cross blood-brain barrier to avoid predicaments of the clinical applications of NSCs that include autoimmune responses, ethical/religious concerns, and the problematic logistics of acquiring fetal tissues. More importantly, NSC-EVs inherit excellent neuroprotective and neuroregenerative potential and immunomodulatory capabilities from parent cells, and display outstanding therapeutic effects on mitigating behavioral alterations and pathological phenotypes of patients or animals with neurological diseases. In this review, we first comprehensively summarize the progress in functional research and application of NSC-EVs in different neurological diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases, acute neurological diseases, dementia/cognitive dysfunction, and peripheral diseases. Next, we provide our thoughts on current limitations/concerns as well as tremendous potential of NSC-EVs in clinical applications. Last, we discuss future directions of further investigations on NSC-EVs and their probable applications in both basic and clinical research.
