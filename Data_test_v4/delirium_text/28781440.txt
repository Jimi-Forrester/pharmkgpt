28781440|t|A prospective observational study of the use of desflurane anesthesia in Indian adult inpatients undergoing surgery: The Registry in India on Suprane Emergence registry.
28781440|a|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Limited registry studies are available on the use of anesthetic agents. This registry was conducted to evaluate emergence outcomes in Indian adult patients undergoing surgery with desflurane anesthesia. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This multicenter, prospective, non-interventional, observational study (Registry in India on Suprane Emergence [RISE] registry) included adult inpatients who received desflurane as general anesthetic for surgical procedure of >=2 h. Patients were stratified by age into three groups: >=18-40 years, >=41-65 years, and >65 years. Data on patients' demographics, practice, and usage pattern of medications were collected. The primary efficacy outcomes were time to extubation, time to response to verbal command, and time to orientation. RESULTS: Of 236 patients screened, 201 (>=18-40 years, n = 70; >=41-65 years, n = 65; >65 years, n = 66) were enrolled in the study. Mean time to extubation observed in >=18-40 years group was 7.2 +- 4.1 min, >=41-65 years was 11.6 +- 8.99 min, and >65 years was 12.0 +- 10.5 min. Mean time to response to verbal command was 7.4 +- 4.3 min for >=18-40 years, 10.9 +- 8.5 min for >=41-65 years, and 10.0 +- 5.4 min for >65 years. Mean time to orientation was 13.0 +- 7.0 min for >=18-40 years, 16.1 +- 12.0 min for >=41-65 years, and 17.0 +- 8.6 min for >65 years. Incidence of nausea and retching/vomiting was observed in 8% of patients each in the postoperative period, and these complications were seen more in the >65 years age group. Overall, desflurane treatment maintained hemodynamic stability and no major airway events were reported. CONCLUSIONS: The RISE registry data suggest that desflurane-based anesthesia provides early recovery with stable hemodynamics without any airway adverse events, in a wide variety of surgical procedures.
