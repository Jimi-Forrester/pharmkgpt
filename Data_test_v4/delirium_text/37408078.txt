37408078|a|Sepsis is defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection, with a high morbidity and mortality rate. Exogenous vitamin C supplementation is a potential therapeutic option for the treatment of multi-organ dysfunction in sepsis due to the significantly lower levels of vitamin C in the circulating blood of sepsis patients compared to healthy subjects and the importance of vitamin C in many of the physiological processes of sepsis. Vitamin C may influence the function of numerous organs and systems, including the heart, lungs, kidneys, brain, and immune defences, by reducing oxidative stress, inhibiting inflammatory factor surges, regulating the synthesis of various mediators and hormones, and enhancing immune cell function. With the development of multiple clinical randomized controlled trials, the outcomes of vitamin C treatment for critically ill patients have been discussed anew. This review's objectives are to provide an overview of how vitamin C affects various organ functions in sepsis and to illustrate how it affects each organ. Understanding the pharmacological mechanism of vitamin C and the organ damage caused by sepsis may help to clarify the conditions and clinical applications of vitamin C.
