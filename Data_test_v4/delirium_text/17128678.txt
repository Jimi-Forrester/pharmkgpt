17128678|a|An estimated 6% to 8% of the adult population age 65 and older and more than 30% of those age 85 and older are affected by a dementing disorder. The annual direct and indirect cost of caring for the 4.5 million people with Alzheimer's disease in the United States is estimated to be at least $100 billion. By 2030, when the entire Baby Boomer generation is age 65 and older, the increased number of people with Alzheimer's disease could exceed the ability to absorb the added cost. Both professional and familial caregivers should be familiar with the treatment interventions that are most effective in reducing the disruptive behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia. This article discusses the various kinds of dementia, their associated symptoms, and the psychosocial treatment options that have been found to be effective in alleviating the effects of the disease on both people with dementia and their caregivers. Psychosocial strategies can be divided into four major subgroups: communication techniques, behavioral strategies, environmental modifications, and caregiver education. The ultimate goal is to optimize functioning of people with dementia and minimize caregiver strain.
