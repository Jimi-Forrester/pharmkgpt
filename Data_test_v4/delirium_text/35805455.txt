35805455|a|The relationship between maternal gingival health status and low birth weight or preterm delivery is controversial. The aim of this study was to analyze the association between maternal oral knowledge and the level of oral health during pregnancy with the risk of obstetric complications and breastfeeding. A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted after an oral health educational intervention in a consecutive sample of 97 pregnant women. Data collection consisted of a validated questionnaire, oral examination, the Caries Index (CAOD) and the Simplified Oral Hygiene Index (IHOS). The participants had a mean age of 32.5 +- 5.19 years and a predominantly university education (57.1%). The level of knowledge regarding oral health was fair (12.5 +- 3.56 correct answers). Older pregnant women (33.0 +- 4.80 years) practiced breastfeeding and had a higher number of correct answers to the questionnaire. Adequate IHOS was associated with higher birth-weight newborns (3333 +- 0.3), whereas poor oral hygiene control was associated with lower birth-weight newborns (2960 +- 0.1) (p < 0.05). A lower level of academic education was associated with worse oral hygiene (p < 0.05). In addition, the greater the number of children, the higher the CAOD. Finally, among non-smoking women, the weight of infants was 437 mg higher. Maternal oral hygiene and the week of delivery were associated with newborn weight (p < 0.05) in a multiple linear regression model. Smoking was also related to low birth weight (p < 0.05). Educational interventions in pregnancy are necessary to decrease the incidence of obstetric adverse effects and improve the oral health of mothers and their children.
