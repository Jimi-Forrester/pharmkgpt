32638490|a|OBJECTIVES: To assess the safety and feasibility of early single-dose mitomycin C (MMC) bladder instillation after robot-assisted radical nephroureterectomy (RARNU) at a tertiary kidney cancer centre. RARNU with bladder cuff excision and subsequent MMC bladder instillation to reduce recurrence risk is the 'gold standard' for high-risk upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma (UUTUC). We adapted a RARNU technique with precise distal ureteric dissection, bladder cuff excision and watertight bladder closure. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed all patients undergoing RARNU for UUTUC at our centre performed as a standardised transperitoneal procedure comprising of: bladder cuff excision, two-layer watertight closure and intraoperative bladder leak test; without re-docking/re-positioning of the robotic surgical system. Patient demographics, the timing of MMC instillation, adverse events (surgical and potentially MMC-related) and length of stay (LOS) were assessed according to the Clavien-Dindo classification. RESULTS: A total of 69 patients underwent a RARNU with instillation of MMC. The median (interquartile range [IQR]) age was 70 (62-78) years. The median (IQR) day of MMC instillation was 2 (1-3) days and the median (IQR) LOS was 2 (2-4) days, with urethral catheter removal on day of discharge in all cases. Only Grade I Clavien-Dindo complications occurred in seven patients (10%); five had ileus, one a wound infection and one a self-limiting delirium, all managed conservatively. No adverse events potentially related to MMC instillation were noted within 30 days postoperatively. CONCLUSION: The use of intravesical MMC instillation given in the immediate postoperative period appears feasible and safe in patients undergoing RARNU with intraoperative confirmation of a water-tight closure ensuring early catheter-free discharge, with no significant adverse events. The potential reduction in intravesical recurrence in patients receiving early MMC needs to be assessed with longitudinal follow-up studies.
