21309171|t|[Review in geriatric medicine].
21309171|a|In 2010, a study emphasizes the difficulty to predict disability trajectories in the last year of life. A meta analysis shows the effectiveness of post-acute geriatric rehabilitation in reducing functional decline after hospitalisation. Several studies evaluated pneumococcal and herpes zoster vaccines' efficacy. A short and simple intervention is effective in reducing benzodiazepine use. The effect of vitamine D on falls and fractures has been further evaluated in several studies. Diagnostic criteria for dementias, including Alzheimer's disease, are moving to better acknowledge their preclinical stages.
