39879997|t|[Diagnostic utility of the MTA-Score depending on age and cerebral microangiopathy in times of automated volumetry].
39879997|a|  To investigate the diagnostic value of the MTA score according to age, cerebral small vessel disease and in times of automated volumetry.  Retrospective analysis of patients with subjective cognitive decline (SCD), amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mixed dementia (MD) who presented to our outpatient dementia clinic between February 2018 and October 2020. Patients underwent cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) including specific MRI sequences needed for automated volumetry. MRI data sets were analyzed regarding MTA score, Fazekas score, hippocampal und temporal lobe percentile and total white matter lesion volume.  Within the study period, 242 patients (100 male, 142 female, mean age 74.7+-9.9 years) with SCD (n=20), aMCI (n=110), AD (n=62) and MD (n=50) were analyzed. MTA score strongly correlated with age (rho=0.545; p<0.001), especially regarding the aMCI and AD group. MTA score differentiated only between prodromal and dementia stages (aMCI vs. AD: p=0.005), whereas hippocampal percentile also showed a trend in differentiating between SCD and aMCI. There was a correlation between MTA score and hippocampal percentile (rho=-0.385; p<0.001), which, on a single group level, could only be shown for the aMCI and AD group. There was significant correlation between MTA score with hippocampal and temporal lobe percentile. MTA score also correlated with Fazekas score (rho=0.451; p<0.001) which again could only be detected within the aMCI and AD group. But there was no correlation between hippocampal percentile and total white matter lesion volume.  When interpreting the MTA score, patient's age needs to be taken into consideration. Especially, in early dementia diagnostics, automated volumetric procedures might be advantageous, but due to the strong correlation of MTA score with hippocampal percentile, the MTA score still is a valid diagnostic marker. Whether hippocampal atrophy is modulated by cerebral small vessel disease still needs to be elucidated.
