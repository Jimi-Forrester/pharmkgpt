36978817|t|Evaluation of Selected Parameters of Oxidative Stress and Adipokine Levels in Hospitalized Older Patients with Diverse Nutritional Status.
36978817|a|Malnutrition is classified as one of the Giant Geriatric Syndromes. It carries serious consequences, such as sarcopenia or depression, which lead to functional disability. The main objective of this study was to identify parameters of oxidative stress and adipokines, which may be potential biomarkers of malnutrition in hospitalized older patients. During the study, selected parameters were determined in 137 senile patients, taking into account their nutritional status determined according to the Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA), as well as an additional tool, namely the Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index (GNRI). Leptin and resistin were determined as the parameters with statistically significant differences between the patients classified according to the MNA. This phenomenon was confirmed using the GNRI classification. However, additional parameters for which differences were observed include the oxidized low-density lipoprotein level and activity of glutathione peroxidase. In conclusion, the determination of the mentioned markers in hospitalized senile patients as an adjunct to the routine assessment of nutritional status might be suggested to identify the early risk of malnutrition so that a personalized nutritional therapy can be implemented as early as possible.
