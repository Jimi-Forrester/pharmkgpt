36900031|t|Syndrome Pattern Recognition Method Using Sensed Patient Data for Neurodegenerative Disease Progression Identification.
36900031|a|Neurodegenerative diseases are a group of conditions that involve the progressive loss of function of neurons in the brain and spinal cord. These conditions can result in a wide range of symptoms, such as difficulty with movement, speech, and cognition. The causes of neurodegenerative diseases are poorly understood, but many factors are believed to contribute to the development of these conditions. The most important risk factors include ageing, genetics, abnormal medical conditions, toxins, and environmental exposures. A slow decline in visible cognitive functions characterises the progression of these diseases. If left unattended or unnoticed, disease progression can result in serious issues such as the cessation of motor function or even paralysis. Therefore, early recognition of neurodegenerative diseases is becoming increasingly important in modern healthcare. Many sophisticated artificial intelligence technologies are incorporated into modern healthcare systems for the early recognition of these diseases. This research article introduces a Syndrome-dependent Pattern Recognition Method for the early detection and progression monitoring of neurodegenerative diseases. The proposed method determines the variance between normal and abnormal intrinsic neural connectivity data. The observed data is combined with previous and healthy function examination data to identify the variance. In this combined analysis, deep recurrent learning is exploited by tuning the analysis layer based on variance suppressed by identifying normal and abnormal patterns in the combined analysis. This variance from different patterns is recurrently used to train the learning model for maximising of recognition accuracy. The proposed method achieves 16.77% high accuracy, 10.55% high precision, and 7.69% high pattern verification. It reduces the variance and verification time by 12.08% and 12.02%, respectively.
