35955761|t|The Deficiency of SCARB2/LIMP-2 Impairs Metabolism via Disrupted mTORC1-Dependent Mitochondrial OXPHOS.
35955761|a|Deficiency in scavenger receptor class B, member 2 (SCARB2) is related to both Gaucher disease (GD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), which are both neurodegenerative-related diseases without cure. Although both diseases lead to weight loss, which affects the quality of life and the progress of diseases, the underlying molecular mechanism is still unclear. In this study, we found that Scarb2-/- mice showed significantly reduced lipid storage in white fat tissues (WAT) compared to WT mice on a regular chow diet. However, the phenotype is independent of heat production, activity, food intake or energy absorption. Furthermore, adipocyte differentiation and cholesterol homeostasis were unaffected. We found that the impaired lipid accumulation of Adiponectin-cre; Scarb2fl/fl mice was due to the imbalance between glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Mechanistically, the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1)/ eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) pathway was down-regulated in Scarb2 deficient adipocytes, leading to impaired mitochondrial respiration and enhanced glycolysis. Altogether, we reveal the role of SCARB2 in metabolism regulation besides the nervous system, which provides a theoretical basis for weight loss treatment of patients with neurodegenerative diseases.
