10909152|a|INTRODUCTION: Sporadic Alzheimer's disease is the most frequent form of dementia and appears to be associated with increasing age and certain genetic and environmental factors. Some studies have recently been published on potential protective factors. CURRENT KNOWLEDGE AND KEY POINTS: Several genes appear to be involved; one of the most common is the ApoE4 allele on chromosome 19. The physiopathology is not elucidated, but recent studies have shown a protective effect for NSAIDs, estrogen, nutritional factors (vitamins E, B6 and B12) as well as some biochemical amino acids (homocysteine). FUTURE PROSPECTS AND PROJECTS: Interventional studies are now in progress and some preventive approaches will soon be available.
