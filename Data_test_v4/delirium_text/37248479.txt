37248479|a|Autoimmune diseases (AID) cause inflammatory changes in the peripheral blood, which might be a predisposing factor for the development of comorbid bipolar disorder (BD). The levels of peripheral inflammatory indicators and cytokines may also serve as potential biomarkers for predicting BD susceptibility and the efficacy of antipsychotics in patients with AID. Herein, we present the case of a 43-year-old female who has suffered from AID for over 16 years and was recently diagnosed with "bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition".
