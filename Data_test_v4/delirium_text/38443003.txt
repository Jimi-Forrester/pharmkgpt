38443003|t|Red Cell Distribution Width is Related to Mild Cognitive Impairment: A Cross-Sectional Study of Community Residents.
38443003|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Previous literature has reported that red cell distribution width (RDW) correlated with Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the correlation with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) was not clear. This study aimed to investigate MCI in the residents aged >=65 living in the suburban of Shanghai, China. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 550 participants were recruited as MCI (MCI group, 226) and normal (NC group, 284) groups and received blood examination voluntarily. Blood routine indexes were tested by blood tests using Sysmex XT-4000i (Japan). The Chi-square test, t-test, and linear regression analysis were used to find the statistical difference and correlation of data, respectively. RESULTS: Each cognition domain of MCI was found to be impaired, the weight of which, however, was different in integral damage. Most MCI people had impairment of attention among cognitive domains (235, 88.3%). According to the results of the binary logistic regression, the highest weight among impaired cognitive domains was for attention in MCI, and the Wald value of attention was higher than those of others (Wald = 51.83). Additionally, RDW had the greatest negative correlation with attention score (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Increased RDW may be considered as a biomarker of MCI.
