21274428|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia among the elderly population. AD, which is characterized as a disease of cognitive deficits, is mainly associated with an increase of amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) in the brain. A growing body of recent studies suggests that protein kinase C (PKC) promotes the production of the secretory form of amyloid precursor protein (sAPPalpha) via the activation of alpha-secretase activity, which reduces the accumulation of pathogenic Abeta levels in the brain. Moreover, activation of PKCalpha and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) is known to increase sAPPalpha. A novel type of PKC, PKCepsilon, activates the Abeta degrading activity of endothelin converting enzyme type 1 (ECE-1), which might be mediated via the MAPK pathway as well. Furthermore, dysregulation of PKC-MAPK signaling is known to increase Abeta levels in the brain, which results in AD phenotypes. Here, we discuss roles of PKC in Abeta production and clearance and its implication in AD.
