35932397|a|OBJECTIVE: To test whether an Internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) program for older adults attenuates symptoms of depression and anxiety. METHODS: Adults aged >= 55 with insomnia were randomized to SHUTi-OASIS (Sleep Healthy Using the Internet for Older Adult Sufferers of Insomnia and Sleeplessness; N = 207) or Patient Education (PE; N = 104). Depression and anxiety were assessed (HADS-D and HADS-A, respectively) at baseline, post-assessment, and 6- and 12-month follow-ups. RESULTS: Multilevel modeling of HADS-D showed a condition by time interaction (F[3,779] = 3.23, p = .02): SHUTi-OASIS participants reported lower symptoms than PE at post-assessment. There was no such interaction effect for HADS-A (F[3,779] = 2.12, p = .10). Generalized linear modeling showed no moderation of effects by baseline symptom severity. CONCLUSIONS: Participants randomized to Internet-delivered CBT-I showed stable depression and anxiety across time, while control participants' depressive symptoms briefly increased. CBT-I may help prevent development or worsening of psychological distress among older adults with insomnia. TRIAL REGISTRATION: [Registered at ClinicalTrials.gov; identifier removed for anonymity].
