37365397|a|OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the experience with telemedicine in patients with cognitive impairments and their caregivers. METHODS: We conducted a survey-based study of patients who completed neurological consultation via video link between January and April 2022. RESULTS: A total of 62 eligible neurological video consultations were conducted for the following categories of patients: Alzheimer's disease (33.87%), amnesic mild cognitive impairment (24.19%), frontotemporal dementia (17.74%), Lewy body dementia (4.84%), mixed dementia (3.23%), subjective memory disorders (12.90%), non-amnesic mild cognitive impairment (1.61%), and multiple system atrophy (1.61%). The survey was successfully completed by 87.10% of the caregivers and directly by the patients in 12.90% of cases. Our data showed positive feedback regarding the telemedicine experience; both caregivers and patients reported that they found neurological video consultation useful (caregivers: 87.04%, 'very useful'; patients: 87.50%, 'very useful') and were satisfied overall (caregivers: 90.74%, 'very satisfied'; patients: 100%, 'very satisfied'). Finally, all caregivers (100%) agreed that neurological video consultation was a useful tool to reduce their burden (Visual Analogue Scale mean +- SD: 8.56 +- 0.69). CONCLUSIONS: Telemedicine is well received by patients and their caregivers. However, successful delivery incorporates support from staff and care partners to navigate technologies. The exclusion of older adults with cognitive impairment in developing telemedicine systems may further exacerbate access to care in this population. Adapting technologies to the needs of patients and their caregivers is critical for the advancement of accessible dementia care through telemedicine.
