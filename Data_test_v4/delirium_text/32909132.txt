32909132|a|Zinc (Zn) is an essential trace element for most organisms, including human beings. It plays a crucial role in several physiological processes such as catalytic reaction of enzymes, cellular growth, differentiation and metabolism, intracellular signaling, and modulation of nucleic acid structure. Zn containing above 50 metalloenzymes is responsible for proteins, receptors, and hormones synthesis and has a critical role in neurodevelopment. Zn also regulates excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters such as glutamate and GABA and is found in high concentration in the synaptic terminals of hippocampal mossy fibers that maintains cognitive function. It regulates LTP and LTD by regulation of AMPA and NMDA receptors. But an excess or deficiency of Zn becomes neurotoxic or cause impairment in growth or sexual maturation. There is mounting evidence that supports this idea of Zn becoming neurotoxic and being involved in the pathogenesis of AD. Zn dyshomeostasis in AD is an area that needs attention as moderate concentration of Zn is involved in the memory regulation via regulation of amyloid plaque. Dyshomeostasis of Zn is involved in the pathogenesis of diseases like AD, ALS, depression, PD, and schizophrenia.
