37713500|a|To ensure the operational stability of transistor-based biosensors in aqueous electrolytes during multiple measurements, effective electrode passivation is crucially important for reliable and reproducible device performances. This paper presents a highly effective and efficient electrode passivation method using a facile solution-processed self-assembled multilayer (SAML) with excellent insulation property to achieve operational stability and reproducibility of electrolyte-gated transistor (EGT) biosensors. The SAML is created by the consecutive self-assembly of three different molecular layers of 1,10-decanedithiol, vinyl-polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane, and 1-octadecanethiol. This passivation enables EGT to operate stably in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) during repeated measurements over multiple cycles without short-circuiting. The SAML-passivated EGT biosensor is fabricated with a solution-processed In2O3 thin film as an amorphous oxide semiconductor working both as a semiconducting channel in the transistor and as a functionalizable biological interface for a bioreceptor. The SAML-passivated EGT including In2O3 thin film is demonstrated for the detection of Tau protein as a biomarker of Alzheimer's disease while employing a Tau-specific DNA aptamer as a bioreceptor and a PBS solution with a low ionic strength to diminish the charge-screening (Debye length) effect. The SAML-passivated EGT biosensor functionalized with the Tau-specific DNA aptamer exhibits ultrasensitive, quantitative, and reliable detection of Tau protein from 1 x 10-15 to 1 x 10-10 M, covering a much larger range than clinical needs, via changes in different transistor parameters. Therefore, the SAML-based passivation method can be effectively and efficiently utilized for operationally stable and reproducible transistor-based biosensors. Furthermore, this presented strategy can be extensively adapted for advanced biomedical devices and bioelectronics in aqueous or physiological environments.
