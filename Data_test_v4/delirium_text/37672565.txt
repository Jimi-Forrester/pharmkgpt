37672565|t|A protein panel in cerebrospinal fluid for diagnostic and predictive assessment of Alzheimer's disease.
37672565|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease with heterogenous pathophysiological changes that develop years before the onset of clinical symptoms. These preclinical changes have generated considerable interest in identifying markers for the pathophysiological mechanisms linked to AD and AD-related disorders (ADRD). On the basis of our prior work integrating cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain proteome networks, we developed a reliable and high-throughput mass spectrometry-selected reaction monitoring assay that targets 48 key proteins altered in CSF. To test the diagnostic utility of these proteins and compare them with existing AD biomarkers, CSF collected at baseline visits was assayed from 706 participants recruited from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. We found that the targeted CSF panel of 48 proteins (CSF 48 panel) performed at least as well as existing AD CSF biomarkers (Abeta42, tTau, and pTau181) for predicting clinical diagnosis, FDG PET, hippocampal volume, and measures of cognitive and dementia severity. In addition, for each of those outcomes, the CSF 48 panel plus the existing AD CSF biomarkers significantly improved diagnostic performance. Furthermore, the CSF 48 panel plus existing AD CSF biomarkers significantly improved predictions for changes in FDG PET, hippocampal volume, and measures of cognitive decline and dementia severity compared with either measure alone. A potential reason for these improvements is that the CSF 48 panel reflects a range of altered biology observed in AD/ADRD. In conclusion, we show that the CSF 48 panel complements existing AD CSF biomarkers to improve diagnosis and predict future cognitive decline and dementia severity.
