31571714|a|OBJECTIVES: Metabolic and endocrine adverse effects are among the most concerning unfavorable consequences of commonly used psychotropic drugs. The present research was planned to assess and determine the effects of haloperidol and clozapine on testosterone, cortisol, and corticosterone levels and also their influence on androgen-dependent organs in adult male Wistar rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Animals were casually distributed into three groups (n = 10 in each group). Drugs were administered intraperitoneally for 28 days. The control group received 2 mL of physiological saline, the second group received haloperidol (0.5 mg/kg), and the third group received clozapine (0.5 mg/kg). The subsequent testosterone, cortisol, and corticosterone plasma concentration levels were analyzed with chemiluminescent immunoassay. RESULTS: Clozapine and haloperidol treatments altered testosterone hormone levels. Testosterone mean values in both the clozapine (1.00-0.58) and haloperidol (0.65-0.62) groups were found to be lower than compared to controls (P = 0.003, P < 0.001). Histomorphometric analysis results also showed reduced testes size and reduced weight of androgen-dependent organs in drug-treated rats. CONCLUSION: It can be suggested that clozapine and haloperidol are effective in reducing the testosterone plasma concentration level and androgen-dependent organ sizes; therefore, clinicians should be aware of these effects when considering the use of antipsychotic drugs.
