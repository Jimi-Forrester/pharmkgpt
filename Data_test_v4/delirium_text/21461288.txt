21461288|t|Value and Safety of Midazolam Anesthesia during Transrectal Ultrasound-Guided Prostate Biopsy.
21461288|a|PURPOSE: Although transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy is useful for diagnosing prostate cancer, it is a painful procedure. There are many methods for providing pain relief and for treating discomfort during the procedure, but occasionally these are reported to be of limited use. We aimed to evaluate the value and safety of midazolam-induced anesthetic transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From August 2008 to December 2009, 104 male patients, who were examined with transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate 12-core biopsy, were randomly assigned to two groups. Group 1 (n=51) received ketorolac (Tarasyn ) 30 mg. Group 2 (n=53) was treated with midazolam (Dormicum ) 3 mg, which was increased to 5 mg if necessary. Immediately after the procedure, the patients were asked to rate their comfort level by using a 10-point visual analog self-assessment pain scale. RESULTS: The pain scale in group 2 was significantly lower than that in group 1 (p<0.05). The patients assigned to group 2 experienced no side-effects from midazolam and were more satisfied than the patients in group 1 (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Midazolam anesthesia relieves pain effectively, and the patient's satisfaction is better than with conventional transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy. Midazolam-induced anesthetic transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy is useful and safe.
