21414946|t|Mortality associated with delirium after hip-surgery: a 2-year follow-up study.
21414946|a|BACKGROUND: delirium after hip-surgery is associated with poor outcome. Few studies examined the mortality risk associated with delirium in elderly hip-surgery patients after 1 year or more. Aim of this study was to examine the hazard risk associated with delirium in elderly hip-surgery patients at 2-year follow-up, controlling for baseline risk factors and interaction effects. METHODS: this is a secondary analysis based on data from a controlled clinical trial evaluating efficacy of haloperidol prophylaxis for delirium conducted in a large medical school-affiliated general hospital in Alkmaar, The Netherlands. Randomised and non-randomised patients (n = 603) were followed-up for 2 years. Predefined risk factors and other potential risk factors for delirium were assessed prior to surgery. Primary outcome was time of death during the follow-up period. Cox proportional hazards were estimated and compared across patients who had postoperative delirium during hospitalisation and those who did not. RESULTS: a total of 90/603 patients (14.9%) died during the study period and 74/603 (12.3%) had postoperative delirium. Incidence of delirium was higher in patients who died (32.2%) compared with those who survived (8.8%). The interaction effect of delirium by illness severity on mortality was significant after adjusting for predefined delirium risk factors and other potential covariates including study intervention (adjusted Hazard risk = 1.05, 95% CI 1.02-1.08). A total of 14/27 delirium patients who were severely ill on admission died during follow-up versus 15/47 delirium patients who were not (RR 1.63 CI 0.93-2.83). CONCLUSIONS: delirium does not independently predict mortality at 2-year follow-up in elderly hip-surgery patients. However, outcome from delirium is particularly poor when other risk factors are present.
