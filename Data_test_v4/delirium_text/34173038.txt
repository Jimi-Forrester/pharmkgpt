34173038|t|LC-MS bioanalysis of targeted nasal galantamine bound chitosan nanoparticles in rats' brain homogenate and plasma.
34173038|a|Validated LC-MS method for the direct quantitative analysis of galantamine (acetylcholinesterase inhibitor) was developed in rat cerebrospinal fluid and brain homogenate besides rat plasma, utilizing structurally close nalbuphine as an internal standard. After a simple protein precipitation step, samples are separated on 2-mum C18 column kept at 40  C, using isocratic flow of 80% methanol in pH 9.5 ammonium formate buffer, and retention times were about 1.8 and 2.9 min for galantamine and nalbuphine, respectively. Mass detection with electrospray ionization (ESI) and positive polarity was able to detect 0.2 ng mL-1 galantamine using single ion monitoring mode (SIM) at m/z 288 for galantamine and m/z 358 for nalbuphine. The method showed linearity within the range of 0.5 - 300 ng mL-1. The proposed method was validated according to FDA guidelines. Trueness and precision showed acceptable values at all quality control levels, and recoveries were within 85.6 - 114.3% in all matrices at all runs and with relative standard deviations within 0.2 - 12.4%. The method was used to study in vivo brain uptake and pharmacokinetics of galantamine from brain homogenate and plasma samples following the administration of nasal galantamine-bound chitosan nanoparticles compared to oral and nasal galantamine solutions, in scopolamine-induced Alzheimer's disease rat model.
