36030814|t|Exploring Social Cognition Tests to Differentiate Frontotemporal Dementia from Depression: A Two-Step Pilot Study.
36030814|a|Behavioral-variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) is challenging to recognize, and often misdiagnosed as depression (DEP). Evidence suggests changes in social cognition (SoCog) precede general cognitive decline in bvFTD. Currently, there are no screening measures of social cognition. 17 bvFTD, 16 DEP, and 18 control participants underwent 6 SoCog tests measuring: emotion recognition; theory of mind; empathy; insight. We used chi2, Wilcoxon rank sum, Kruskal-Wallis tests to compare groups, with decision tree analysis to identify items that best differentiated bvFTD from DEP. bvFTD performed significantly worse on all SoCog tasks compared with other groups. Decision tree analysis yielded a 5-item test with ROC area under the curve of 0.973 (95% CI: 0.928, 1.0) for differentiating bvFTD versus depression. These results suggest that it may be feasible to develop a screening measure of social cognition.
