35942744|a|The coupling between functional and structural brain networks is difficult to clarify due to the complicated alterations in gray matter and white matter for the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). A cohort of 112 participants [normal control group (NC, 62 cases), mild cognitive impairment group (MCI, 31 cases) and AD group (19 cases)], was recruited in our study. The brain networks of rsfMRI functional connectivity (rsfMRI-FC) and diffusion tensor imaging structural connectivity (DTI-SC) across the three groups were constructed, and their correlations were evaluated by Pearson's correlation analyses and multiple comparison with Bonferroni correction. Furthermore, the correlations between rsfMRI-SC/DTI-FC coupling and four neuropsychological scores of mini-mental state examination (MMSE), clinical dementia rating-sum of boxes (CDR-SB), functional activities questionnaire (FAQ) and montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) were inferred by partial correlation analyses, respectively. The results demonstrated that there existed significant correlation between rsfMRI-FC and DTI-SC (p < 0.05), and the coupling of rsfMRI-FC/DTI-SC showed negative correlation with MMSE score (p < 0.05), positive correlations with CDR-SB and FAQ scores (p < 0.05), and no correlation with MoCA score (p > 0.05). It was concluded that there existed FC/SC coupling and varied network characteristics for rsfMRI and DTI, and this would provide the clues to understand the underlying mechanisms of cognitive deficits of AD.
