10911879|t|The parahippocampal gyrus in Alzheimer's disease. Clinical and preclinical neuroanatomical correlates.
10911879|a|The human parahippocampal gyrus forms a large part of the limbic lobe along the ventromedial part of the temporal cortical mantle. It is a variable and complicated cortex in terms of structure, and the latter is aggravated further by interfaces with the anterior insula anteriorly and the cingulate gyrus and occipital lobe posteriorly. Additional complications relate to its lateral border with the temporal cortex and especially the sulcal configurations that define this junction. The rhinal sulcus, which separates parahippocampal and temporal cortices in other species, including the anthropoid apes, is either lacking or rudimentary in the human brain. Thus, defining this junction requires cytoarchitectural examination and precludes the use of mere inspection of sulcal existing patterns. The cortical areas that form the parahippocampal gyrus are vulnerable to pathological changes in Alzheimer's disease (AD), and its entorhinal and perirhinal subdivisions are both the most heavily damaged cortical areas and the focus for disease onset. The neurons that acquire neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) occupy the junction of the isocortical mantle with the limbic cortical mantle, but share, or partially share, a vulnerability phenotype with large neurons in both domains. The differential expression of this phenotype across time creates the false impression of NFT spread in cross-sectional comparisons of AD brains. The questions of what this phenotype is and why it is expressed first in the perirhinal and entorhinal cortices of the parahippocampal gyrus are the central molecular biological/neuroanatomical questions in understanding the etiology of AD.
