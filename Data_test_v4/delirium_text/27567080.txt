27567080|t|Synthesis and evaluation of 8-hydroxyquinolin derivatives substituted with (benzo[d][1,2]selenazol-3(2H)-one) as effective inhibitor of metal-induced Abeta aggregation and antioxidant.
27567080|a|A series of 8-hydroxyquinolin derivatives substituted with (benzo[d][1,2]selenazol-3(2H)-one) at the 2-position were synthesized and evaluated for treatment of Alzheimer's disease. In vitro assays demonstrated that most of the target compounds exhibit significant inhibition of Cu(II)-induced Abeta1-42 aggregation, rapid H2O2 scavenging and glutathione peroxidise (GPx)-like catalytic activity. Among these molecules, compound 9a is the most potent peroxide scavenger that possesses the ability to scavenge most H2O2 within 200-220min and possesses GPx-like activity (v0=106.0muM min(-1)), enabling modulation of metal-induced Abeta aggregation.
