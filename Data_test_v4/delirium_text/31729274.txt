31729274|t|Factors That Influence the Reintegration to Normal Living for Older Adults 2 Years Post Hip Fracture.
31729274|a|Objectives: This study aims to identify factors that influence older adults' reintegration to normal living 2 years following a hip fracture and the association between caregiver burden and reintegration over time. Methods: This longitudinal cohort study followed 76 community-dwelling older adults and their caregivers for 2 years post-hip fracture. The primary outcome was Reintegration to Normal Living Index (RNLI), and the secondary outcome was caregiver burden. Results: Older adults scored significantly lower on RNLI at 18 to 24 months if they had few social interactions, cognitive impairment, or lower pre-fracture functional status. During follow-up, greater independence in activities of daily living and greater mobility were each positively associated with RNLI. Caregiver burden reduced if reintegration improved. Implications: Results suggest a need for targeted interventions for older adults' post-hip fracture to improve their function to enhance their reintegration to normal living and to support caregivers in decreasing their burden of care.
