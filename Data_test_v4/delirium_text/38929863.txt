38929863|a|The beach chair position (BCP) is widely used in shoulder surgery; however, it frequently leads to hypotension. Hypotension in BCP is prevalent among older patients who are at risk of secondary complications such as ischemic injuries. Therefore, this prospective study aimed to investigate the association and predictive value of frailty, as assessed by ultrasound-measured quadriceps depth and questionnaire, in patients aged >=65 years undergoing elective shoulder surgery under general anesthesia. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify independent risk factors for hypotension in BCP under general anesthesia. Receiver operating characteristic curves were constructed to assess the predictive values of various parameters. The results indicated that a quadriceps depth < 2.3 cm and BCP for an extended period significantly increased the risk of hypotension. The combined consideration of quadriceps depth < 2.3 cm and frailty demonstrated markedly superior predictive power compared with each factor individually. In conclusion, the study findings facilitate the screening and identification of risk factors for older patients undergoing surgery in BCP, thereby enhancing perioperative management.
