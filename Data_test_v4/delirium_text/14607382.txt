14607382|a|Although many patients are surviving longer than in the past, a cancer diagnosis may shatter the dream of a dignified old age for elderly patients. Cancer diagnosis and treatment often produce psychologic stresses resulting from the actual symptoms of the disease, as well as perceptions of the disease and its stigma. Concerns related to cancer have particular meaning for aging individuals who undergo these situations in the context of retirement, widowhood, other medical disabilities and other losses. Today, patients and families are more interested in treatment issues, and quality of life, both during and after treatment. In this article we discuss late life depression, anxiety and delirium as they relate to elderly patients coping with cancer.
