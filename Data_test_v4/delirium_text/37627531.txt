37627531|t|Doped Graphene Quantum Dots as Biocompatible Radical Scavenging Agents.
37627531|a|Oxidative stress is proven to be a leading factor in a multitude of adverse conditions, from Alzheimer's disease to cancer. Thus, developing effective radical scavenging agents to eliminate reactive oxygen species (ROS) driving many oxidative processes has become critical. In addition to conventional antioxidants, nanoscale structures and metal-organic complexes have recently shown promising potential for radical scavenging. To design an optimal nanoscale ROS scavenging agent, we have synthesized ten types of biocompatible graphene quantum dots (GQDs) augmented with various metal dopants. The radical scavenging abilities of these novel metal-doped GQD structures were, for the first time, assessed via the DPPH, KMnO4, and RHB (Rhodamine B protectant) assays. While all metal-doped GQDs consistently demonstrate antioxidant properties higher than the undoped cores, aluminum-doped GQDs exhibit 60-95% radical scavenging ability of ascorbic acid positive control. Tm-doped GQDs match the radical scavenging properties of ascorbic acid in the KMnO4 assay. All doped GQD structures possess fluorescence imaging capabilities that enable their tracking in vitro, ensuring their successful cellular internalization. Given such multifunctionality, biocompatible doped GQD antioxidants can become prospective candidates for multimodal therapeutics, including the reduction of ROS with concomitant imaging and therapeutic delivery to cancer tumors.
