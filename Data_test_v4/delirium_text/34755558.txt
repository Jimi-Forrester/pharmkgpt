34755558|a|Introduction: Nosocomial COVID-19 increases morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing surgical procedures. This study assesses the consenting process in patients admitted for surgical procedures with regard to risks of contracting nosocomial COVID-19 infection during the three lockdown periods in the United Kingdom.Methods: Retrospective review of consecutive surgical patients admitted to our tertiary referral centre for surgical procedures during the lockdown periods in the United Kingdom. Data from our hospital's electronic theatre database cross-referenced with the online surgical operative, admission and discharge records were reviewed by three independent reviewers.Discussion: A total of 180 patients (104 males and 76 females) were studied. No patients tested positive perioperatively for COVID-19. The first lockdown had a significantly larger proportion of consultants consenting (P < 0.001). Surgeons consented patients for risk of COVID-19 infection in 34.4% of cases, COVID-19-related illness in 33.9%, inpatient Intensive Care Unit (ITU) admission secondary to COVID-19 infection and risk of death due to COVID-19 in 0.0% and risk of death secondary to inpatient COVID infection in 1.1%.Conclusion: As surgical activity continues and COVID-19 persists, surgeons should be vigilant and ensure proper documentation for consent regarding COVID-19-related complications in line with the Royal College of Surgeons of England guidelines.
