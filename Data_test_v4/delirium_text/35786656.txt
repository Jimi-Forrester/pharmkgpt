35786656|a|BACKGROUND: Phosphatidylethanolamine binding protein 1 (PEBP1) is a multifunctional protein, mainly known for its specific binding of phosphatidylethanolamine and the ability to suppress the Raf1-MAPK pathway. Its potential role as an Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarker has been proposed in several studies. However, evaluation of its discriminative value in clinical cohorts is missing. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to develop a new immunoassay for the measurement of PEBP1 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and assess the possible role of this protein as AD biomarker. METHODS: We developed a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for detection of PEBP1 in CSF and performed a technical and a clinical validation on two well-characterized cohorts. The first cohort included 14 mild cognitive impairment due to AD (MCI-AD) and 11 other neurological diseases (OND) patients. The second, larger cohort, included 25 MCI-AD, 29 AD dementia (AD-dem), and 21 OND patients. RESULTS: PEBP1 is highly sensitive to pre-analytical conditions, especially to prolonged storage at room temperature or 4 C. Analysis of the first cohort showed a trend of an increase of PEBP1 level in MCI-AD patients versus OND subjects. Analysis of the second cohort did not show significant differences among diagnostic groups. Weak, positive correlation was found between CSF PEBP1 and t-tau, p-tau, and Abeta40 in the AD-dem group. CONCLUSION: A novel ELISA for the detection of PEBP1 in CSF was developed. Further research is needed to assess the potential of PEBP1 in AD diagnostics. The observed dependence of the PEBP1 signal on operating procedures encourages its potential application as CSF quality control.
