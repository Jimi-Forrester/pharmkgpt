36500427|t|Role of Alginate Composition on Copper Ion Uptake in the Presence of Histidine or Beta-Amyloid.
36500427|a|The anomalous interaction between metal ions and the peptide beta-amyloid is one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. Metal-binding biopolymers, including polysaccharides, can elucidate the fundamental aspects of metal ions' interactions with biological tissue and their interplay in Alzheimer's disease. This work focuses on the role of the alginate composition on Cu(II) adsorption in the presence of histidine or beta-amyloid, the peptide associated with the progression of Alzheimer's disease. Alginate samples with different mannuronic/guluronic (M/G) ratios led to similar Cu(II) adsorption capacities, following the Langmuir isotherm and the pseudo-second-order adsorption kinetic models. Although the presence of histidine produced up to a 20% reduction in the copper adsorption capacity in guluronic-rich alginate samples (M/G~0.61), they presented stable bidentate chelation of the metallic ion. Chemical analyses (FTIR and XPS) demonstrated the role of hydroxyl and carboxyl groups in copper ion chelation, whereas both crystallinity and morphology analyses indicated the prevalence of histidine interaction with guluronic-rich alginate. Similar results were observed for Cu(II) adsorption in alginate beads in the presence of beta-amyloid and histidine, suggesting that the alginate/histidine system is a simple yet representative model to probe the application of biopolymers to metal ion uptake in the presence of biological competitors.
