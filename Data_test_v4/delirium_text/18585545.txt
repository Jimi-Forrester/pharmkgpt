18585545|a|OBJECTIVE: To raise awareness of a rare but serious adverse effect of a commonly used medication. METHOD: Report of a case. RESULTS: A previously healthy 42-year-old woman presented with acute-onset delirium with psychotic features as a consequence of levofloxacin therapy. Withdrawal of the medication was associated with return of the patient's normal mental status. CONCLUSION: The new quinolone derivatives (levofloxacin, sparfloxacin, grepafloxacin, trovafloxacin, gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin), also called gyrase inhibitors, are known for their potential to cause central nervous system-related adverse effects, including headache, dizziness and insomnia. Risk factors for neurotoxicity include renal insufficiency, underlying central nervous system (CNS) disease and increased CNS penetration of drug. Acute delirium resulting from levofloxacin therapy is an exceedingly rare complication that has been thought to occur more commonly in elderly patients. Here, we describe levofloxacin-induced delirium with psychotic features in a relatively young, otherwise healthy female.
