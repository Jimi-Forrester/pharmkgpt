Inflammation and inflammasome activation have emerged as a potential link between these disparate pathologies. As diet is a key factor in both the development of metabolic disorders and inflammation, we hypothesize that long term changes in dietary factors can influence nervous system function by regulating inflammasome activity and that this phenotype would be sex-dependent, as sex hormones are known to regulate metabolism and immune processes. METHODS: 5-week-old male and female transgenic mice expressing a caspase-1 bioluminescent reporter underwent cranial window surgeries and were fed control (65% complex carbohydrates, 15% fat), high glycemic index (65% carbohydrates from sucrose, 15% fat), or ketogenic (1% complex carbohydrates, 79% fat) diet from 6 to 26 weeks of age. Glucose regulation was assessed with a glucose tolerance test following a 4-h morning fast. Bioluminescence in the brain was quantified using IVIS in vivo imaging. Blood cytokine levels were measured using cytokine bead array. 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicon sequencing of mouse feces was performed to assess alterations in the gut microbiome. Behavior associated with these dietary changes was also evaluated. RESULTS: The ketogenic diet caused weight gain and glucose intolerance in both male and female mice. In male mice, the high glycemic diet led to increased caspase-1 biosensor activation over the course of the study, while in females the ketogenic diet drove an increase in biosensor activation compared to their respective controls. These changes correlated with an increase in inflammatory cytokines present in the serum of test mice and the emergence of anxiety-like behavior. The microbiome composition differed significantly between diets; however no significant link between diet, glucose tolerance, or caspase-1 signal was established. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that diet composition, specifically the source and quantity of carbohydrates, has sex-specific effects on inflammasome activation in the central nervous system and behavior. This phenotype manifested as increased anxiety in male mice, and future studies are needed to determine if this phenotype is linked to alterations in microbiome composition.
