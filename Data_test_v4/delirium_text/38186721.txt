38186721|a|Delirium is an acute reversible neuropsychiatric syndrome caused by multiple factors. It is associated with many adverse clinical outcomes including cognitive impairment, functional decline, prolonged hospitalization, and increased nursing service. The prevalence of delirium was high in department of cardiology, geriatric, and intensive care unit of hospital. With the increase in the aged population, further increases in delirium seem likely. However, it remains poorly recognized in the clinical practice. This article comprehensively discusses the latest research perspectives on the epidemiological data, risk factors, preventive interventions, overlapping symptoms, and clinical measures of delirium, including specific measures to manage delirium in clinical real-world situations. This article helps readers improve their knowledge and understanding of delirium and helps clinicians quickly identify and implement timely therapeutic measures to address various delirium subtypes that occur in the clinical settings to ensure patients are treated as aggressively as possible.
