36903395|t|Anticancer Therapeutic Effects of Green Tea Catechins (GTCs) When Integrated with Antioxidant Natural Components.
36903395|a|After decades of research and development concerning cancer treatment, cancer is still at large and very much a threat to the global human population. Cancer remedies have been sought from all possible directions, including chemicals, irradiation, nanomaterials, natural compounds, and the like. In this current review, we surveyed the milestones achieved by green tea catechins and what has been accomplished in cancer therapy. Specifically, we have assessed the synergistic anticarcinogenic effects when green tea catechins (GTCs) are combined with other antioxidant-rich natural compounds. Living in an age of inadequacies, combinatorial approaches are gaining momentum, and GTCs have progressed much, yet there are insufficiencies that can be improvised when combined with natural antioxidant compounds. This review highlights that there are not many reports in this specific area and encourages and recommends research attention in this direction. The antioxidant/prooxidant mechanisms of GTCs have also been highlighted. The current scenario and the future of such combinatorial approaches have been addressed, and the lacunae in this aspect have been discussed.
