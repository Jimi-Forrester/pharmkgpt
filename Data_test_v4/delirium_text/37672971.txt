37672971|t|Inclusion of frailty improved performance of delirium prediction for elderly patients in the cardiac intensive care unit (D-FRAIL): A prospective derivation and external validation study.
37672971|a|BACKGROUND: The elderly patients admitted to cardiac intensive care unit (CICU) are at relatively high risk for developing delirium. A simple and reliable predictive model can benefit them from early recognition of delirium followed by timely and appropriate preventive strategies. OBJECTIVE: To explore the role of frailty in delirium prediction and develop and validate a delirium predictive model including frailty for elderly patients in CICU. DESIGN: A prospective, observational cohort study. SETTINGS: CICU at China-Japan Friendship Hospital from March 1, 2022 to August 25, 2022 (derivation cohort); CICU at Beijing Anzhen Hospital affiliated to Capital Medical University from March 14, 2023 to May 8, 2023 (external validation cohort). PARTICIPANTS: A total of 236 and 90 participants were enrolled in the derivation and external validation cohorts, respectively. Participants in the derivation cohort were assigned into either the delirium (n = 70) or non-delirium group (n = 166) based on the occurrence of delirium. METHODS: The simplified Chinese version of the Confusion Assessment Method for the Diagnosis of Delirium in the Intensive Care Unit was used to assess delirium twice a day at 8:00-10:00 and 18:00-20:00 until the onset of delirium or discharge from the CICU. Frailty was assessed using the FRAIL scale during the first 24 h in the CICU. Other possible risk factors were collected prospectively through patient interviews and medical records review. After processing missing data via multiple imputations, univariate analysis and bootstrapped forward stepwise logistic regression were performed to select optimal predictors and develop the models. The models were internally validated using bootstrapping and evaluated comprehensively via discrimination, calibration, and clinical utility in both the derivation and external validation cohorts. RESULTS: The study developed D-FRAIL predictive model using FRAIL score, hearing impairment, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation-II score, and fibrinogen. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.937 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.907-0.967) and 0.889 (95%CI: 0.840-0.938) even after bootstrapping in the derivation cohort. Inclusion of frailty was demonstrated to improve the model performance greatly with the AUC increased from 0.851 to 0.937 (p < 0.001). In the external validation cohort, the AUC of D-FRAIL model was 0.866 (95%CI: 0.782-0.907). Calibration plots and decision curve analysis suggested good calibration and clinical utility of the D-FRAIL model in both the derivation and external validation cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: For elderly patients in the CICU, FRAIL score is an independent delirium predictor and the D-FRAIL model demonstrates superior performance in predicting delirium.
