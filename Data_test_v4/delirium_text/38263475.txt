38263475|a|BACKGROUND: Optical coherence tomography (OCT) biomarkers are increasingly used by neurologists, psychiatrists, and ophthalmologists for the diagnosis, prognosis, and follow-up of neurodegenerative diseases. Long-term data on OCT biomarkers of selected primary and secondary neurodegenerative diseases of the central nervous system (CNS), such as multiple sclerosis (MS) or Parkinson's disease, are already available in part. In addition, there are rare neurodegenerative diseases with early disease onset that may show OCT abnormalities. METHODS: A literature review on the association of OCT biomarkers with neurodegenerative diseases of the CNS beyond Alzheimer's disease is presented. Parkinson's disease, MS, Friedreich's ataxia, Huntington's disease, spinocerebellar ataxia, and lysosomal storage diseases are addressed. RESULTS: Relevant OCT biomarkers of neurodegenerative diseases are the macular ganglion cell inner plexiform layer (GCIPL) and the peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL) thickness. Different sectors may be affected depending on the disease entity in addition to global pRFNL reduction. OCT-angiography (OCT-A) is also increasingly used as a biomarker in neurodegenerative diseases. CONCLUSION: Optical coherence tomography biomarkers are used in an interdisciplinary context. Retinal pathologies should be excluded by an ophthalmologist. While OCT biomarkers are increasingly used clinically in MS, the benefit in other neurodegenerative diseases, especially the rare ones, is less well documented. Further longitudinal studies are required.
