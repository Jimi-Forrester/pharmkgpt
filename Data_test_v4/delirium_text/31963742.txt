31963742|a|Oxidative stress (OS) and mitochondrial dysfunction (MDF) occur in a number of disorders, and several clinical studies have attempted to counteract OS and MDF by providing adjuvant treatments against disease progression. The present review is aimed at focusing on two apparently distant diseases, namely type 2 diabetes (T2D) and a rare genetic disease, Fanconi anemia (FA). The pathogenetic links between T2D and FA include the high T2D prevalence among FA patients and the recognized evidence for OS and MDF in both disorders. This latter phenotypic/pathogenetic feature-namely MDF-may be regarded as a mechanistic ground both accounting for the clinical outcomes in both diseases, and as a premise to clinical studies aimed at counteracting MDF. In the case for T2D, the working hypothesis is raised of evaluating any in vivo decrease of mitochondrial cofactors, or mitochondrial nutrients (MNs) such as alpha-lipoic acid, coenzyme Q10, and l-carnitine, with possibly combined MN-based treatments. As for FA, the established knowledge of MDF, as yet only obtained from in vitro or molecular studies, prompts the requirement to ascertain in vivo MDF, and to design clinical studies aimed at utilizing MNs toward mitigating or delaying FA's clinical progression. Altogether, this paper may contribute to building hypotheses for clinical studies in a number of OS/MDF-related diseases.
