29416029|t|Neuroglobin boosts axon regeneration during ischemic reperfusion via p38 binding and activation depending on oxygen signal.
29416029|a|Cerebral ischemia causes severe cell death or injury including axon breakdown or retraction in the brain. Axon regeneration is crucial for the functional recovery of injured neurons or brains after ischemia/reperfusion (I/R); however, this process has been proved extremely difficult in adult brains and there is still no effective therapy for it. Here we reported that neuroglobin (Ngb), a novel oxygen-binding or sensor protein existing predominantly in neurons or brains, functions as a driving factor for axon regeneration during I/R. Ngb was upregulated and accumulated in growth cones of ischemic neurons in primary cultures, rat, and human brains, correlating positively to the elevation of axon-regeneration markers GAP43, neurofilament-200, and Tau-1. Ngb overexpression promoted while Ngb knockdown suppressed axon regeneration as well as GAP43 expression in neurons during oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/Re). By using specific pharmacological inhibitors, we identified p38 MAPK as the major downstream player of Ngb-induced axon regeneration during OGD/Re. Mechanistically, Ngb directly bound to and activated p38 in neurons upon OGD/Re. Serial truncation and point mutation of Ngb revealed that the 7-105 aa fragment of Ngb was required and the oxygen-binding site (His64) of Ngb was the major regulatory site for its p38 interaction/activation. Finally, administration of exogenous TAT-Ngb peptides significantly enhanced axon regeneration in cultured neurons upon OGD/Re. Taken together, Ngb promotes axon regeneration via O2-Ngb-p38-GAP43 signaling during I/R. This novel mechanism suggests potential therapeutic applications of Ngb for ischemic stroke and other related axonopathy.
