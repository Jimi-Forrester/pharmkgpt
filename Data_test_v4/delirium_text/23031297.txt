23031297|t|[Sudden deaths by hobble restraint of severely hyperactive persons].
23031297|a|Cardiac arrest may occur while persons are being kept in hobble restraint. It has been suggested that asphyxia caused by the restraint position, so-called restraint asphyxia, is the cause, but experimental evidence has not confirmed this theory. Some of the sudden deaths are associated with excited delirium syndrome (EDS), an acute condition characterized by a hyperactive, combative behaviour in individuals, who are influenced by psychoactive drugs or suffer from psychiatric illness. Autopsy findings fail to explain this type of deaths. The pathophysiology of EDS is complex and poorly understood. Sensibilisation of the heart by a hyperadrenergic autonomous dysfunction, metabolic acidosis and hyperthermia offer possible mechanisms.
