35655903|a|Treatment of SARS-CoV-2 targeting its RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is of current interest. Remdesivir has been approved for the treatment of COVID-19 around the world. However, the drug has been linked with pharmacological limitations like adverse effects and reduced efficiency. Nevertheless, recent advancements have depicted molnupiravir as an effective therapeutic agent to target the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. The drug has cleared both in vitro and in vivo screening. It is in phase-III clinical trial. Nonetheless, there are no data on themolecular binding interaction of molnupiravir with RdRp. Therefore, it is of interest to report the binding interaction of molnupiravir using molecular docking. It is also of interest to show its stability during interaction using molecular dynamics and binding free energy calculations along with drug likeliness and pharmacokinetic properties in comparison with remdesivir.
