38239330|a|We propose a novel method to assess delayed primacy in the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) memory test. We then examine whether this measure predicts post mortem Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathology in individuals who were clinically unimpaired at baseline. A total of 1096 individuals were selected from the Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center database registry. All participants were clinically unimpaired at baseline, and had subsequently undergone brain autopsy. Average age at baseline was 78.8 (6.92). A Bayesian regression analysis was carried out with global pathology as an outcome; demographic, clinical, and apolipoprotein E (APOE) data as covariates; and cognitive predictors, including delayed primacy. Global AD pathology was best predicted by delayed primacy. Secondary analyses showed that delayed primacy was mostly associated with neuritic plaques, whereas total delayed recall was associated with neurofibrillary tangles. Sex differential associations were observed. We conclude that CERAD-derived delayed primacy is a useful metric for early detection and diagnosis of AD in unimpaired individuals. Highlights: We propose a novel method to analyse serial position in the CERAD memory test.We analyse data from 1096 individuals who were cognitively unimpaired at baseline.Delayed primacy predicts post mortem pathology better than traditional metrics.
