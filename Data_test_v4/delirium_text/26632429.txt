26632429|t|Age-Related Sleep Changes and its Implication in Neurodegenerative Diseases.
26632429|a|In the article authors discuss the current data on sleep changes with aging focusing on the influence of age-related degenerative changes in orexin-containing and pacemaker brain areas. Pathophysiological mechanisms of sleep disturbances in Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases have much in common with normal age neurophysiological changes. Maintenance of the sleep-promoting systems function could positively modify the course of these diseases.
