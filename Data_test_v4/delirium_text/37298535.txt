37298535|t|New Insights on the Activity and Selectivity of MAO-B Inhibitors through In Silico Methods.
37298535|a|To facilitate the identification of novel MAO-B inhibitors, we elaborated a consolidated computational approach, including a pharmacophoric atom-based 3D quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) model, activity cliffs, fingerprint, and molecular docking analysis on a dataset of 126 molecules. An AAHR.2 hypothesis with two hydrogen bond acceptors (A), one hydrophobic (H), and one aromatic ring (R) supplied a statistically significant 3D QSAR model reflected by the parameters: R2 = 0.900 (training set); Q2 = 0.774 and Pearson's R = 0.884 (test set), stability s = 0.736. Hydrophobic and electron-withdrawing fields portrayed the relationships between structural characteristics and inhibitory activity. The quinolin-2-one scaffold has a key role in selectivity towards MAO-B with an AUC of 0.962, as retrieved by ECFP4 analysis. Two activity cliffs showing meaningful potency variation in the MAO-B chemical space were observed. The docking study revealed interactions with crucial residues TYR:435, TYR:326, CYS:172, and GLN:206 responsible for MAO-B activity. Molecular docking is in consensus with and complementary to pharmacophoric 3D QSAR, ECFP4, and MM-GBSA analysis. The computational scenario provided here will assist chemists in quickly designing and predicting new potent and selective candidates as MAO-B inhibitors for MAO-B-driven diseases. This approach can also be used to identify MAO-B inhibitors from other libraries or screen top molecules for other targets involved in suitable diseases.
