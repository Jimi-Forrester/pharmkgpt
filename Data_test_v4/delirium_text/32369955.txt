32369955|a|Neuroinflammation is a crucial process associated with the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease (PD). Several pieces of evidence suggest an active role of lipid mediators, especially epoxy-fatty acids (EpFAs), in the genesis and control of neuroinflammation; 14,15-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (14,15-EET) is one of the most commonly studied EpFAs, with anti-inflammatory properties. Soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) is implicated in the hydrolysis of 14,15-EET to its corresponding diol, which lacks anti-inflammatory properties. Preventing EET degradation thus increases its concentration in the brain through sEH inhibition, which represents a novel pharmacological approach to foster the reduction of neuroinflammation and by end neurodegeneration. Recently, it has been shown that sEH levels increase in brains of PD patients. Moreover, the pharmacological inhibition of the hydrolase domain of the enzyme or the use of sEH knockout mice reduced the deleterious effect of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) administration. This paper overviews the knowledge of sEH and EETs in PD and the importance of blocking its hydrolytic activity, degrading EETs in PD physiopathology. We focus on imperative neuroinflammation participation in the neurodegenerative process in PD and the putative therapeutic role for sEH inhibitors. In this review, we also describe highlights in the general knowledge of the role of sEH in the central nervous system (CNS) and its participation in neurodegeneration. We conclude that sEH is one of the most promising therapeutic strategies for PD and other neurodegenerative diseases with chronic inflammation process, providing new insights into the crucial role of sEH in PD pathophysiology as well as a singular opportunity for drug development.
