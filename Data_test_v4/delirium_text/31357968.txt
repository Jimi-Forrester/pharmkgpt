31357968|t|Adherence to medication in neurogeriatric patients: an observational cross-sectional study.
31357968|a|BACKGROUND: Poor adherence is a major issue and is associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and immense costs for the healthcare system. Due to demographic changes, the burden of neurological diseases is increasing with a crucial exacerbation of the problem of nonadherence. However, comprehensive data on geriatric patients with neurological disorders do not exist to date. In this cross-sectional observational study we aim to identify disease-specific adherence-modulating factors in neurogeriatric patients. METHODS: Patients 60 years or older with neurological disorders will receive an assessment of adherence (Stendal Adherence with Medication Score) and a comprehensive geriatric assessment during their stay in the Department of Neurology or Geriatrics at the Jena University Hospital (baseline data). In addition disease specific data will be derived from medical records. After one and twelve months a telephone interview will be conducted to evaluate if and why changes of medication occurred (follow up data). DISCUSSION: This study aims to explore disease-specific patterns of nonadherence in elderly patients with neurological disorders and characteristics of information transfer between a specialized center, practicing neurologists, general practitioners, and the patients and their caregivers. This comprehensive data may help to develop and apply complex and disease-specific interventions to enhance adherence. TRIAL REGISTRATION: German Clinical Trials Register DRKS00016774.
