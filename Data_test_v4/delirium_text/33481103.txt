33481103|t|Screening of Potential Stress Biomarkers in Sweat Associated with Sports Training.
33481103|a|BACKGROUND: Intense and continuous physical training in sports is related with psychological and physiological stress, affecting the health and well-being of athletes. The development of non-invasive sampling methodologies is essential to consider sweat as a potential biological fluid for stress biomarker assessment. In the current work, the identification in sweat samples of potential molecules that may be used as stress biomarkers was pursued. METHODS: A sweat pool sample from football players after a 90-min intense training game was studied. RESULTS: An analysis method using liquid chromatography with detection by tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MSMS) to attain a screening profile of sweat composition is presented. The major focus was on neurotransmitters (e.g. monoamines and metabolites) and other biological molecules related with physical training, such as precursors of biogenic amines (phenylaniline, tyrosine, etc.). CONCLUSIONS: This study allowed the identification of small biomolecules, neurotransmitters and other related molecules in sweat that are potentially associated with stress conditions. The developed methodology intends to contribute to the assessment and study of physical and psychological stress biomarkers related with intense sports using non-invasive methods.
