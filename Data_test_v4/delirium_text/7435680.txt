7435680|t|Stress response syndrome occurring after delirium.
7435680|a|Psychiatric treatment of delirium usually focuses on behavioral management during the period of cognitive disturbance. Psychological sequelae have received less attention. The authors suggest that delirium represents a stressful life event that must be assimilated after the cognitive impairment has resolved. Such assimilation may be uniquely impaired because the patient lacks clear and correct information about the event. The authors propose that the psychiatric care of delirium include facilitation of the patient's efforts to obtain and assimilate information about the delirium after its resolution.
