16136844|a|This article discusses the literature supporting the limited use of tube feeding, antibiotics, and hospital transfers of nursing home residents with end-stage dementia. This article also presents the findings of a study that queried 138 nursing home social service staff members in New York State regarding positions taken by key medical decision makers regarding tube feeding, antibiotic use, and hospitalization of nursing home residents with end-stage dementia. Results are discussed in the context of positions taken by experts in palliative and dementia care. According to social service staff perceptions, the majority of these key decision-makers (e.g., administrators, directors of nursing, and medical directors) take positions inconsistent with palliative care experts. Instead, a majority of them were perceived as more likely to encourage tube feeding, antibiotics, and hospitalization of nursing home residents with end-stage dementia. These findings indicate a strong need for educating administrative staff in state-of-the-art care of residents with end-stage dementia.
