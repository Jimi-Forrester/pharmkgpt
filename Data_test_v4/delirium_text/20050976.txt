20050976|t|An update on clinical proteomics in Alzheimer's research.
20050976|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a pathologically complex and aetiologically multifactorial dementing disorder affecting millions of people worldwide. The pathological brain changes are assumed to occur decades prior to the onset of clinical symptoms. The diagnosis of early AD remains problematic and is mainly based on clinical and neuropsychological findings after the onset of symptoms. Currently available drugs are able to delay the symptom progression of the disease but not to attenuate the progression of pathological brain changes. Many studies exploring AD proteomes have been conducted as the middle of 1990s as a consequence of recent advances in the development of both gel-based and gel-free proteomics approaches. It is hoped that proteomics can contribute to improving the understanding, diagnosis, and follow-up of the progression of AD. In this review, we summarise the present status of proteome alterations, with emphasis on quantitative approaches, in AD brain, CSF and blood, and their relevance to dementia research.
