39410641|t|Improving Alzheimer's Disease Prediction with Different Machine Learning Approaches and Feature Selection Techniques.
39410641|a|Machine learning (ML) has increasingly been utilized in healthcare to facilitate disease diagnosis and prediction. This study focuses on predicting Alzheimer's disease (AD) through the development and comparison of ML models using Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Logistic Regression (LR) algorithms. Additionally, feature selection techniques including Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR) and Mutual Information (MI) were employed to enhance the model performance. The research methodology involved training and testing these models on the OASIS-2 dataset, evaluating their predictive accuracies. Notably, LR combined with mRMR achieved the highest accuracy of 99.08% in predicting AD. These findings underscore the efficacy of ML algorithms in AD prediction and highlight the utility of the feature selection methods in improving the model performance. This study contributes to the ongoing efforts to leverage ML for more accurate disease prognosis and underscores the potential of these techniques in advancing clinical decision-making.
