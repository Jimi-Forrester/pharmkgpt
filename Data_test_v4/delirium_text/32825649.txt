32825649|a|The aim of the study was to determine how feeding rats a high-fat diet supplemented with various forms of chromium affects DNA methylation and oxidation reactions as well as the histology of heart and brain tissue. The rats received standard diet or high-fat diet and chromium at 0.3 mg/kg body weight (BW) in form of chromium (III) picolinate, chromium (III)-methionine, or nano-sized chromium. The content of malondialdehyde (MDA), protein carbonyl (PC), and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHDG), the level of global DNA methylation and the activity of selected DNA repair enzymes were determined in the blood. In the brain and heart, the content of MDA, PC, 8-OHDG, and levels of global DNA methylation were determined. The brain was subjected to histological examination. The use of a high-fat diet was found to intensify epigenetic changes and oxidation reactions in the heart and brain. It was concluded that epigenetic changes and oxidation of lipids, proteins, and DNA in the heart and brain of rats resulting from the use of a high-fat diet cannot be limited by supplementing the diet with chromium. It was established that the use of chromium to supplement a high-fat diet intensifies the negative epigenetic and oxidative changes in the heart and brain, especially in the case of chromium nanoparticles.
