33236458|a|BACKGROUND: Delirium is an acute condition that occurs in hospitalised patients and leads to poor patient outcomes that can last long term. Therefore, the importance of prevention is undeniable and adopting new models of care for at-risk patients should be prioritised. OBJECTIVES: This systematic review and meta-analysis will assess the effectiveness of different interventions designed to prevent or manage delirium in acutely unwell hospitalised patients. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, OpenGrey, Web of Science and reference lists of journals were searched. Eligible studies reported on incidence or duration of delirium, used a validated delirium diagnostic tool and compared an intervention to either a control or another intervention group. Meta-analyses were conducted, and GRADEpro software was used to assess the certainty of evidence. This review is registered on PROSPERO. RESULTS: A total of 59 studies were included and 33 were eligible for meta-analysis. Delirium incidence was most significantly reduced by non-pharmacological multicomponent interventions compared with usual care, with pooled risk ratios of 0.57 (95% CI: 0.44 to 0.73, 10 randomised controlled trials) and 0.47 (95% CI: 0.35 to 0.64, six observational studies). Single-component interventions did not significantly reduce delirium incidence compared with usual care in seven randomised trials (risk ratio = 0.92, 95% CI: 0.81 to 1.04). The most effective single-component intervention in reducing delirium incidence was a hospital-at-home intervention (risk ratio = 0.29, 95% CI: 0.09 to 0.87). CONCLUSIONS: Non-pharmacological multicomponent interventions are effective in preventing delirium; however, the same cannot be said for other interventions because of uncertain results. There is some evidence that providing multicomponent interventions in patients' homes is more effective than in a hospital setting. Therefore, researching the benefits of hospital-at-home interventions in delirium prevention is recommended.
