34277180|t|Opioid-Induced Psychosis in a Patient With Sickle Cell Disease.
34277180|a|Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a common inherited hemoglobin disorder in which people have atypical hemoglobin, known as hemoglobin S. It is highly prevalent in non-Hispanic Blacks and people of Arab descent. It causes a distortion of the shape of red blood cells, leading to occlusion of blood vessels and thus tissue hypoxia and injury. The resultant infarction/reperfusion, in turn, causes fatigue and pain. Patients with SCD require constant analgesic medications for pain management. In the general population, opioids are amongst the most prescribed medications for pain management and the trend has been gradually growing during the past two decades. Side effects commonly associated with opioids are gastrointestinal and central nervous system-related, with up to 80% of patients experiencing at least one adverse effect. We report the case of a 36-year-old male patient who has a history of cannabis use and no prior psychiatric history, who developed acute psychosis while receiving a high dose of hydromorphone for sickle cell pain crisis. This case contributes to the growing literature about opioid-induced psychosis and also explores psychosis in sickle cell disease. Understanding the pharmacology and potential side effects of opioids is critical given the increasing number of patients using prescribed and illicit opioids.
