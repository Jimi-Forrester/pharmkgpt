28676096|a|BACKGROUND: Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) potentially offer new routes to study, on the basis of the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD) concept, how the maternal environment during pregnancy influences the offspring's health and can predispose to chronic disease in later life. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), antioxidant defences and cellular redox status play a key function in gene expression regulation and are involved in diabetes and metabolic syndromes as in ageing. METHODS: We have, therefore, designed an in vitro cell model of oxidative stress by exposing hESCs to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) during 72 h, in order to resemble the period of preimplantation embryonic development. RESULTS: We have analysed the global gene expression profiles of hESCs (HUES3) exposed to non-cytotoxic H2O2 concentrations, using Illumina microarray HT-12 v4, and we found the differential expression of 569 upregulated and 485 downregulated genes. The most affected gene ontology categories were those related with RNA processing and splicing, oxidation reduction and sterol metabolic processes. We compared our findings with a published RNA-seq profiling dataset of human embryos developed in vitro, thereupon exposed to oxidative stress, and we observed that one of the common downregulated genes between this publication and our data, NEDD1, is involved in centrosome structure and function. CONCLUSIONS: Therefore, we assessed the presence of supernumerary centrosomes and showed that the percentage of cells with more than two centrosomes increased acutely with H2O2 treatment in hESCs (HUES3 and 7) and in a control somatic cell line (Hs27), inducing a premature entry into senescence.
