37873836|a|Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) is a metabolic disease reaching pandemic levels worldwide. In parallel, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VaD) are the two leading causes of dementia in an increasingly long-living Western society. Numerous epidemiological studies support the role of T2D as a risk factor for the development of dementia. However, few basic science studies have focused on the possible mechanisms involved in this relationship. On the other hand, this review of the literature also aims to explore the relationship between T2D, AD and VaD. The data found show that there are several alterations in the central nervous system that may be promoting the development of T2D. In addition, there are some mechanisms by which T2D may contribute to the development of neurodegenerative diseases such as AD or VaD.
