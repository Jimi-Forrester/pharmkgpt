34705879|a|BACKGROUND: The intensive care unit (ICU) staffing model affects clinical outcomes of critically ill patients. However, the benefits of a closed unit model have not been extensively compared to those of a mandatory critical care consultation model. METHODS: This retrospective before-after study included patients admitted to the medical ICU. Anthropometric data, admission reason, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group grade, survival status, length of stay (LOS) in the ICU, duration of mechanical ventilator care, and occurrence of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) were recorded. The staffing model of the medical ICU was changed from a mandatory critical care consultation model to a closed unit model in September 2017, and indices before and after the conversion were compared. RESULTS: A total of 1,526 patients were included in the analysis. The mean age was 64.5 years, and 954 (62.5%) patients were men. The mean LOS in the ICU among survivors was shorter in the closed unit model than in the mandatory critical care consultation model by multiple regression analysis (5.5 vs. 6.7 days; p = 0.005). Central venous catheter insertion (38.5% vs. 51.9%; p < 0.001) and VAP (3.5% vs. 8.6%; p < 0.001) were less frequent in the closed unit model group than in the mandatory critical care consultation model group. After adjusting for confounders, the closed unit model group had decreased ICU mortality (adjusted odds ratio 0.65; p < 0.001) and shortened LOS in the ICU compared to the mandatory critical care consultation model group. CONCLUSION: The closed unit model was superior to the mandatory critical care consultation model in terms of ICU mortality and LOS among ICU survivors.
