In patients with Alzheimer disease (AD), physical activity could be a useful strategy in therapeutic management by delaying loss of functional independence and the usual complications of the disease. OBJECTIVE: To determine, using standardized tools, the effects on autonomy (ADL, IADL), cognitive function (MMS), nutritional status (MNA), behavioral problems (NPI) and risk of falls (Tinetti test) of a physical exercise program in patients with AD. DESIGN: Twenty-three subjects (13 men and 10 women, aged 71-92 years, mean 78 years) with AD (mean MMS 16, range 1-23) carried out for a mean of 7 weeks (5-12 weeks) a program of endurance exercise (walking, exercise bicycle) adapted to their individual capacities. Standardized gerontological evaluation was performed before and after the study. RESULTS: No significant change in autonomy (ADL, IADL) was observed. There was an improvement in the MNA (p<0.001) and the MMS (p<0.001). Risk of falls (p<0.01) and behavioral problems (p<0.05) decreased. These results were obtained without increasing family workload. CONCLUSION: We suggest that physical activity is a therapeutic option which can reduce nutritional and behavioral complications and risk of falls in subjects with AD.
