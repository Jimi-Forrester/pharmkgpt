32320454|a|Cancer immunotherapy using chimeric antigen receptor-armed T (CAR T) cells have been shown to improve outcomes significantly in patients with hematological malignancies. However, cytokine release syndrome (CRS) remains a risk. CRS is characterized by the excessive activation of CAR T cells and macrophages. Signs and symptoms of CRS are usually resolved after steroid administration, but steroids abrogate the expansion and persistence of CAR T cell populations. Tocilizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) that attenuates CRS without significant loss of CAR T cell activity. However, interleukin-6 (IL-6)/IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) blockade alone cannot relieve CRS symptoms fully, and novel treatments are needed to prevent or cure CRS. TO-207 is an N-benzoyl-L-phenylalanine derivative that significantly inhibits inflammatory cytokine production in human monocyte and macrophage-specific manner. We investigated whether TO-207 could inhibit cytokine production without impairing CAR T cell function in a CRS-simulating co-culture system.
