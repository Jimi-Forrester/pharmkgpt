15324366|a|Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a common problem in the elderly. Genetic research may yield valuable clues to improve the diagnostic and prognostic tools for MCI. As the majority of patients progress into Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other forms of dementia, the genetics of MCI cannot be separated from the genetics of AD and dementia in general. Follow-up studies of carriers of mutations underlying AD may yield valuable clues for the development of new diagnostic tools for MCI. In particular, large-scale studies of carriers of the apolipoprotein E 4 allele may still be of interest. Our knowledge of the genes involved in MCI is still very limited. In addition, we need powerful and carefully designed candidate gene studies aiming to discover new genes involved in the risk and progression of MCI. Although the genetics of MCI will be difficult to disentangle, there is ample opportunity to improve research of the genes involved.
