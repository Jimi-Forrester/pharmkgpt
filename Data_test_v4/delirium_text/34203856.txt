34203856|t|Comparative Investigation of Collagen-Based Hybrid 3D Structures for Potential Biomedical Applications.
34203856|a|Collagen is a key component for devices envisaging biomedical applications; however, current increasing requirements impose the use of multicomponent materials. Here, a series of hybrid collagen-based 3D materials, comprising also poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) and different concentrations of hyaluronic acid (HA)-in dense, porous or macroporous form-were characterized in comparison with a commercially available collagen sponge, used as control. Properties, such as water uptake ability, water vapour sorption, drug loading and delivery, were investigated in correlation with the material structural characteristics (composition and morphology). Methylene blue (MB) and curcumin (CU) were used as model drugs. For spongeous matrices, it was evidenced that, in contrast to the control sample, the multicomponent materials favor improved sustained release, the kinetics being controlled by composition and cross-linking degree. The other characteristics were within an acceptable range for the intended purpose of use. The obtained results demonstrate that such materials are promising for future biomedical applications (wound dressings and lab models).
