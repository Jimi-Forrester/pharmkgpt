37264528|a|OBJECTIVE: Assess risk of common musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) based on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk scores. METHODS: Data from a nine-year prospective cohort of 1,224 workers in 3 states were analyzed. Baseline data included questionnaires, structured interviews, physical examinations, anthropometric measurements, nerve conduction studies, and individualized measurement of job physical factors. Monthly follow-ups were conducted. Framingham risk scores were calculated. A priori case definitions were constructed for carpal tunnel syndrome, lateral epicondylopathy, medial epicondylopathy, and rotator cuff tendinopathy. RESULTS: Adjusted RRs for one or more MSDs increased to 3.90 (95% CI, 2.20, 6.90) among those with 10-year CVD risk scores above 15% and 17.4 (95% CI 3.85, 78.62) among those with 4+ disorders. CONCLUSIONS: CVD factors are strongly associated with the subsequent development of common MSDs. Risks among those with multiple MSDs are considerably stronger.
