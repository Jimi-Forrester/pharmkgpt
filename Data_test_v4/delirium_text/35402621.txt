35402621|t|Association of Blood Amyloid Beta-Protein 1-42 with Poststroke Cognitive Impairment: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
35402621|a|Background: Increases in blood of amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) have been noted in patients with Alzheimer's dementia (AD). Recent studies have shown that blood amyloid beta-protein 1-42 (Abeta1-42) level is closely related to poststroke cognitive impairment (PSCI), which may be the influencing factor and even a predictor of PSCI. The aim of this systematic review was to synthesize the evidence for the association of cognitive impairment among PSCI. Methods: PubMed (MEDLINE), EMBASE, Cochrane Library, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trial (CENTRAL), CNKI, and WanFang data were searched. Case-control, cohort, and cross-sectional studies that evaluated the association between blood Abeta1-42 and PSCI were included irrespective of language and date of publication. The outcomes of this review consisted of (1) any dementia, (2) any cognitive impairment, and (3) any cognitive impairment no dementia, which were assessed at least 3 months (90 days) after stroke. Exposure of interest was blood Abeta1-42 level (including serum and plasma). Results: Of 617 records retrieved, 8 studies (6 case-control and 2 cohort studies) involving 931 stroke patients were included for further analysis. 8 studies with 931 subjects explored the correlation between Abeta1-42 and PSCI. PSCI was reported in 457 patients, and the pooled SMD of amyloid beta-protein 1-42 was -0.96 (95% CI -1.10~-0.82, I 2 = 15%, P < 0.01). The results remained robust in sensitivity analysis adjusting for study quality, sample source, and cognitive scale score in analysis of studies, as well as in analysis adjusted for publication bias. Conclusions: Blood Abeta1-42 level was significantly negatively related to the risk for PSCI, and more prospective studies with large sample size are needed to define a precise threshold value of blood Abeta1-42 level to predict PSCI in the future. This study is registered with PROSPERO, registration number: CRD42021246165.
