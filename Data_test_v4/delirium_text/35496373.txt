35496373|t|Vascular cognitive impairment and dementia: An early career researcher perspective.
35496373|a|The field of vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID) is evolving rapidly. Research in VCID encompasses topics aiming to understand, prevent, and treat the detrimental effects of vascular disease burden in the human brain. In this perspective piece, early career researchers (ECRs) in the field provide an overview of VCID, discuss past and present efforts, and highlight priorities for future research. We emphasize the following critical points as the field progresses: (a) consolidate existing neuroimaging and fluid biomarkers, and establish their utility for pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions; (b) develop new biomarkers, and new non-clinical models that better recapitulate vascular pathologies; (c) amplify access to emerging biomarker and imaging techniques; (d) validate findings from previous investigations in diverse populations, including those at higher risk of cognitive impairment (e.g., Black, Hispanic, and Indigenous populations); and (e) conduct randomized controlled trials within diverse populations with well-characterized vascular pathologies emphasizing clinically meaningful outcomes.
