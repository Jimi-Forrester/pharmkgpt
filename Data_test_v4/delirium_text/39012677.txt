39012677|t|Dysregulation of Lipid Metabolism Serves as A Link Between Alzheimer's and Cardiovascular Disease, As Witnessed in A Cross-Sectional Study.
39012677|a|Cardiovascular risk factors and established cardiovascular disease (CVD) increase the risk of suffering dementia of the Alzheimer's type (DAT). Here, we set out to define specific molecular profiles of CVD in patients with DAT to better understand its relationship, to unravel the mechanisms underlying the high risk of developing DAT in CVD patients and to define new markers of early disease. Plasma samples from patients with DAT, with and without CVD, were analyzed through a multiomics approach, with integration of metabolomics and proteomics datasets using the OmicsNet web-based tool. Metabolomics results showed an enrichment in lipids and lipid-like molecules. Similarly, the most significant cluster identified through proteomics was formed by 5 proteins related to lipoprotein and cholesterol metabolism. After integration and functional enrichment, glycerolipid metabolism, fatty acid degradation and sphingolipid metabolism were among the most significant functions. Finally, differential expression of ABCA1 and APOH proteins was verified, in an independent cohort also including controls and patients with CVD alone. Both proteins positively correlated with phospho-Tau (181), a classical hallmark of DAT. Different molecular profiles exist in patients with DAT, with and without CVD, with exacerbated alterations in patients in which DAT and CVD co-exist. This information may help to define biomarkers like ABCA1 and APOH that identify patients with cardiovascular dysfunction that are at high risk of developing DAT. Such markers will allow more personalized interventions to be selected, a further step towards precision medicine for individuals whose molecular profiles indicate a distinct response to the same management strategies.
