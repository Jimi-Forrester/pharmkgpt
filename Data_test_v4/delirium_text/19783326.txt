19783326|t|No association between high temperature requirement 1 (HTRA1) gene polymorphisms and Alzheimer's disease.
19783326|a|High temperature requirement 1 (HTRA1) gene is a plausible risk factor in Alzheimer's disease (AD) as it encodes a protease known to degrade amyloid-beta peptide. Here we have studied whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the HTRA1 gene or its nearby regions associated with AD in a large clinic-based case-control cohort originating from Finland. We did not observe significant association of the HTRA1 SNPs with AD among the whole case-control cohort or age-at-onset risk effect among AD patients.
