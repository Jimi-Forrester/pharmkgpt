33539089|a|Kinases are a group of therapeutic targets involved in the progression of numerous diseases, including cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, Alzheimer's disease, and viral infections. The majority of approved antiviral agents are inhibitors of virus-specific targets that are encoded by individual viruses. These inhibitors are narrow-spectrum agents that can cause resistance development. Viruses are dependent on host cellular proteins, including kinases, for progression of their life-cycle. Thus, targeting kinases is an important therapeutic approach to discovering broad-spectrum antiviral agents. As there are a large number of FDA approved kinase inhibitors for various indications, their repurposing for viral infections is an attractive and time-sparing strategy. Many kinase inhibitors, including baricitinib, ruxolitinib, imatinib, tofacitinib, pacritinib, zanubrutinib, and ibrutinib, are under clinical investigation for COVID-19. Herein, we discuss FDA approved kinase inhibitors, along with a repertoire of clinical/preclinical stage kinase inhibitors that possess antiviral activity or are useful in the management of viral infections.
