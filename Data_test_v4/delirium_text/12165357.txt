12165357|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains are characterized by extensive oxidative stress. Additionally, large depositions of amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) are observed, and many researchers opine that Abeta is central to the pathogenesis of AD. Our laboratory combined these two observations in a comprehensive model for neurodegeneration in AD brains centered around Abeta-induced oxidative stress. Given the oxidative stress in AD and its potentially important role in neurodegeneration, considerable research has been conducted on the use of antioxidants to slow or reverse the pathology and course of AD. One source of antioxidants is the diet. This review examines the literature of the effects of endogenous and exogenous, nutritionally-derived antioxidants in relation to AD. In particular, studies of glutathione and other SH-containing antioxidants, vitamins, and polyphenolic compounds and their use in AD and modulation of Abeta-induced oxidative stress and neurotoxicity are reviewed.
