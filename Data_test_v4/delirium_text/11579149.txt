11579149|a|DNA damage induced by low doses of ionizing radiation causes apoptosis, which is partially mediated via the generation of free radicals. Both free radicals and apoptosis are involved in the majority of brain diseases, including stroke, Alzheimer's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Because previous studies have shown that tetracycline derivatives doxycycline and minocycline have anti-inflammatory effects and are protective against brain ischemia, we studied whether minocycline and doxycycline or ceftriaxone, a cephalosporin antibiotic with the potential to inhibit excitotoxicity, protect neurons against ionizing radiation in primary cortical cultures. A single dose of 1 Gy significantly increased lactate dehydrogenase release, induced DNA fragmentation in neurons and triggered microglial proliferation. Treatment with minocycline (20 nM), doxycycline (20 nM) and ceftriaxone (1 microM) significantly reduced irradiation-induced lactate dehydrogenase release and DNA fragmentation. The most efficient protection was achieved by minocycline treatment, which also inhibited the irradiation-induced increase in microglial cell number. Our results suggest that some tetracycline derivatives, such as doxycycline and minocycline, and ceftriaxone, a cephalosporin derivative, protect neurons against apoptotic death.
