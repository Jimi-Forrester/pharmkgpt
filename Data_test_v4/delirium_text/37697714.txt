37697714|a|Our aim is to review the most recent evidence on novel antibody therapies for Alzheimer's disease directed against amyloid-beta. This is a joint statement of the European Association of Neurology and the European Psychiatric Association. After numerous unsuccessful endeavors to create a disease-modifying therapy for Alzheimer's disease, substantial and consistent evidence supporting the clinical effectiveness of monoclonal antibodies aimed at amyloid-beta is finally emerging. The latest trials not only achieved their primary objective of slowing the progression of the disease over several months but also demonstrated positive secondary clinical outcomes and a decrease in amyloid-beta levels as observed through positron emission tomography scans. Taken as a whole, these findings mark a significant breakthrough by substantiating that reducing amyloid-beta yields tangible clinical benefits, beyond mere changes in biomarkers. Concurrently, the regular utilization of the new generation of drugs will determine whether statistical efficacy translates into clinically meaningful improvements. This may well signify the dawning of a new era in the development of drugs for Alzheimer's disease.
