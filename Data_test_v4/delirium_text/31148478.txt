31148478|t|Anticholinesterase activity and metabolite profiling of Syagrus romanzoffiana (Cham.) Glassman leaves and fruits via UPLC-QTOF-PDA-MS.
31148478|a|The purpose of this study is to provide a complete metabolic profile of the hydroalcoholic extracts of the leaves and fruits of Syagrus romanzoffiana (Cham.) Glassman via UPLC-QTOF-PDA-MS and to evaluate their anticholinesterase activities in a model of Alzheimer disease. The current study has identified 39 metabolites belonging to various chemical classes (i.e. flavonols, phenolic acids, fatty acids, stilbenoids and lignans). While the fatty acids predominated in both leaves and fruits, the stilbenoids were more predominant in leaves. Their neuroprotective effect was comparable to Aricept; the standard drug used in treatment of Alzheimer disease. Both extracts significantly decreased the acetylcholinesterase activity and improved the histopathological changes in the cerebral cortex and cerebellum of rat model of aluminium chloride-induced Alzheimer disease. In light of the current study, Syagrus romanzoffiana (Cham.) Glassman is recommended as promising candidate for palliative treatment in Alzheimer disease through inhibition of the acetylcholinesterase activity.
