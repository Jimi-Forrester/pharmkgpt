35406732|t|Human Umbilical Cord Mesenchymal Stem Cells: Current Literature and Role in Periodontal Regeneration.
35406732|a|Periodontal disease can cause irreversible damage to tooth-supporting tissues such as the root cementum, periodontal ligament, and alveolar bone, eventually leading to tooth loss. While standard periodontal treatments are usually helpful in reducing disease progression, they cannot repair or replace lost periodontal tissue. Periodontal regeneration has been demonstrated to be beneficial in treating intraosseous and furcation defects to varied degrees. Cell-based treatment for periodontal regeneration will become more efficient and predictable as tissue engineering and progenitor cell biology advance, surpassing the limitations of present therapeutic techniques. Stem cells are undifferentiated cells with the ability to self-renew and differentiate into several cell types when stimulated. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been tested for periodontal regeneration in vitro and in humans, with promising results. Human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) possess a great regenerative and therapeutic potential. Their added benefits comprise ease of collection, endless source of stem cells, less immunorejection, and affordability. Further, their collection does not include the concerns associated with human embryonic stem cells. The purpose of this review is to address the most recent findings about periodontal regenerative mechanisms, different stem cells accessible for periodontal regeneration, and UC-MSCs and their involvement in periodontal regeneration.
