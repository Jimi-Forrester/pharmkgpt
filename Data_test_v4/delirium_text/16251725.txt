16251725|a|The 20th biennial meeting of the International Society for Neurochemistry was recently held in Innsbruck, Austria. This meeting gave an overview of the latest findings in the field of molecular mechanisms and diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and prion disease. There was a focus on the molecular pathogenesis of protein misfolding in these disorders as well as on the association between oxidative metabolism and neurological diseases. RNA interference, metal chelators, and the use of metallopeptidases were discussed as possible therapeutic strategies.
