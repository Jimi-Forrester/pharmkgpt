Lipids play a crucial functional role in cell membranes; however, we know little about the role of lipids in extracellular vesicles (EVs) as regulatory molecules and disease biomarkers. METHODS: We employed a sensitive lipidomic strategy to characterize lipid species from the plasma EVs of AUD patients to evaluate functional roles and enzymatic activity networks to improve the knowledge of lipid metabolism after alcohol consumption. We analyzed plasma EV lipids from AUD females and males and healthy individuals to highlight lipids with differential abundance and biologically interpreted lipidomics data using LINEX2, which evaluates enzymatic dysregulation using an enrichment algorithm. RESULTS: Our results show, for the first time, that AUD females exhibited more significant substrate-product changes in lysophosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylcholine lipids and phospholipase/acyltransferase activity, which are potentially linked to cancer progression and neuroinflammation. Conversely, AUD males suffer from dysregulated ceramide and sphingomyelin lipids involving sphingomyelinase, sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase, and sphingomyelin synthase activity, which relates to hepatotoxicity. Notably, the analysis of plasma EVs from AUD females and males demonstrates enrichment of lipid ontology terms associated with "negative intrinsic curvature" and "positive intrinsic curvature", respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our methodological developments support an improved understanding of lipid metabolism and regulatory mechanisms, which contribute to the identification of novel lipid targets and the discovery of sex-specific clinical biomarkers in AUD.
