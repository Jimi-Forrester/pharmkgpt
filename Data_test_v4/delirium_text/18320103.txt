18320103|a|INTRODUCTION: The E280A mutation of the presenilin 1 gene has been found to be the most common associate in Alzheimers patients with a family history of this disease. Presenilin 1 is a critical component of the g-secretase complex and plays an essential role in the production of amyloid-beta peptide. This peptide has been strongly associated with the physiopathology of the disease. OBJECTIVE: The E280A mutation in the presenilin 1 was investigated for increased production of amyloid-beta , as a response to gain in gamma-secretase function. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Levels of systemic amyloid-beta were measured with congo red staining and immuno-histochemistry of the tissues of affected cadavers, compared with non-affected cadavers. The 40 and 42 amino acid amyloid-beta levels were quantified by ELISA assay in CHO cell cultures. The amyloid precursor protein expressed by the cultures was detected by transfection with the cDNAs of presenilin 1 carrying the M146L, E280A, DE9 y L392V mutations. RESULTS: Protein deposits were found in all tissues investigatged, but only a few with beta -amyloid deposition. No differences were observed in the amount or location of amyloid-beta between affected and unaffected cadavers. Not increase was noted in the production of amyloid-beta from the CHO cells transfected with cDNA from any of the mutations of presenilin 1. CONCLUSIONS: The E280A mutation in the presenilin 1 gene was not associated with the increased production of amyloid-beta in non-neuronal peripheral tissues, or in the in vitro model. This is in contrast to the expectation in a gamma-secretase gain of function.
