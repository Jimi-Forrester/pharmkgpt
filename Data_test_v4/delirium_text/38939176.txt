38939176|a|The present study aimed to identify preoperative and perioperative risk factors for postoperative infectious complications in older patients with gastric cancer. The present retrospective study included 504 patients with gastric cancer aged >65 years who underwent radical gastrectomy. After determining the cutoff values for various perioperative factors in the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, preoperative and perioperative risk factors for the development of infectious complications after gastrectomy were examined using logistic regression analysis. Of the 504 patients who underwent gastrectomy, 95 (18.8%) developed infectious complications of grade II-V based on the Clavien-Dindo classification. In an analysis restricted to preoperative factors, male sex, low prognostic nutritional index, high visceral fat area and total gastrectomy were independent risk factors for infectious complications after gastrectomy. Among all perioperative factors, a low prognostic nutritional index and long operative duration were identified as independent risk factors for infectious complications after gastrectomy. The patients were divided into five groups according to the number of positive preoperative risk factors for infectious complications, and the incidence of infectious complications differed among the five groups (0 factors, 6.7%; 1 factor, 10.4%; 2 factors, 18.9%; 3 factors, 27.8%; and 4 factors, 47.6%; P<0.001). Older patients with gastric cancer who have a number of preoperative risk factors require careful consideration of the indication for gastrectomy and a shorter operative time to reduce infectious complications.
