35741010|t|MicroRNA Networks in Cognition and Dementia.
35741010|a|The change from viewing noncoding RNA as "junk" in the genome to seeing it as a critical epigenetic regulator in almost every human condition or disease has forced a paradigm shift in biomedical and clinical research. Small and long noncoding RNA transcripts are now routinely evaluated as putative diagnostic or therapeutic agents. A prominent role for noncoding microRNAs in the central nervous system has uncovered promising new clinical candidates for dementia-related disorders, treatments for which currently remain elusive even as the percentage of diagnosed patients increases significantly. Cognitive decline is a core neurodegenerative process in Alzheimer's Disease, Frontotemporal Dementia, Lewy body dementia, vascular dementia, Huntington's Disease, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and a significant portion of Parkinson's Disease patients. This review will discuss the microRNA-associated networks which influence these pathologies, including inflammatory and viral-mediated pathways (such as the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus implicated in COVID-19), and their current status in clinical trials.
