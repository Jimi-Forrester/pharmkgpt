37875604|t|Proteomic characterization of aging-driven changes in the mouse brain by co-expression network analysis.
37875604|a|Brain aging causes a progressive decline in functional capacity and is a strong risk factor for dementias such as Alzheimer's disease. To characterize age-related proteomic changes in the brain, we used quantitative proteomics to examine brain tissues, cortex and hippocampus, of mice at three age points (3, 15, and 24 months old), and quantified more than 7000 proteins in total with high reproducibility. We found that many of the proteins upregulated with age were extracellular proteins, such as extracellular matrix proteins and secreted proteins, associated with glial cells. On the other hand, many of the significantly downregulated proteins were associated with synapses, particularly postsynaptic density, specifically in the cortex but not in the hippocampus. Our datasets will be helpful as resources for understanding the molecular basis of brain aging.
