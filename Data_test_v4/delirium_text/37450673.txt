37450673|t|EP1 receptor: Devil in emperors coat.
37450673|a|EP1 receptor belongs to prostanoid receptors and is activated by prostaglandin E2. The receptor performs contrasting functions in central nervous system (CNS) and other tissues. Although the receptor is neurotoxic and proapoptotic in CNS, it has also been reported to act in an antiapoptotic manner by modulating cell survival, proliferation, invasion, and migration in different types of cancers. The receptor mediates its neurotoxic effects by increasing cytosolic Ca2+ levels, leading to the activation of its downstream target, protein kinase C, in different neurological disorders including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, stroke, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and epilepsy. Antagonists ONO-8713, SC51089, and SC51322 against EP1 receptor ameliorate the neurotoxic effect by attenuating the neuroinflammation. The receptor also shows increased expression in different types of cancers and has been found to activate different signaling pathways, which lead to the development, progression, and metastasis of different cancers. The receptor stimulates the cell survival pathway by phosphorylating the AKT and PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10) signaling pathways. Although there are limited studies about this receptor and not a single clinical trial has been targeting the EP1 receptor for different neurological disorders or cancer, the receptor is appearing as a potential candidate for therapeutic targets. The aim of this article is to review the recent progress in understanding the pathogenic roles of EP1 receptors in different pathological conditions.
