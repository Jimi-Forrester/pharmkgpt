37954292|a|Among many types of wearable sensors, MOFs-based wearable sensors have recently been explored in both commercialization and research. There has been much effort in various aspects of the development of MOF-based wearable sensors including but not limited to miniaturization, size control, safety, improvements in conformal and flexible features, improvements in the analytical performance and long-term storage of these devices. Recent progress in the design and deployment of MOFs-based wearable sensors are covered in this paper, as are the remaining obstacles and prospects. This work also highlights the enormous potential for synergistic effects of MOFs used in combination with other nanomaterials for healthcare applications and raise attention toward the economic aspect and market diffusion of MOFs-based wearable sensors.
