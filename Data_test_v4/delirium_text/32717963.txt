32717963|t|Reduced Recovery Capacity After Major Trauma in the Elderly: Results of a Prospective Multicenter Registry-Based Cohort Study.
32717963|a|AIMS: Considering the worldwide trend of an increased lifetime, geriatric trauma is moving into focus. Trauma is a leading cause of hospitalization, leading to disability and mortality. The purpose of this study was to compare the global health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of geriatric patients with adult patients after major trauma. METHODS: This multicenter prospective registry-based observational study compares HRQoL of patients aged >=65 years who sustained major trauma (Injury Severity Score (ISS) >= 16) with patients <65 years of age within the trauma registry of the German Trauma Society (DGU). The global HRQoL was measured at 6, 12, and 24 months post trauma using the EQ-5D-3L score. RESULTS: We identified 405 patients meeting the inclusion criteria with a mean ISS of 25.6. Even though the geriatric patients group (>=65 years, n = 77) had a lower ISS (m = 24, SD = 8) than patients aged <65 years (n = 328), they reported more difficulties in each EQ dimension compared to patients <65 years. Contrary to patients < 65, the EQ-5D Index of the geriatric patients did not improve at 12 and 24 months after trauma. CONCLUSIONS: We found a limited HRQoL in both groups after major trauma. The group of patients >=65 showed no improvement in HRQoL from 6 to 24 months after trauma.
