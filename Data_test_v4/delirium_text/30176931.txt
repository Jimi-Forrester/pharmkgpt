30176931|a|While hypoxic pre-conditioning protects against neurological disease the underlying mechanisms have yet to be fully defined. As chronic mild hypoxia (CMH, 10% O2) triggers profound vascular remodeling in the central nervous system (CNS), the goal of this study was to examine the protective potential of hypoxic pre-conditioning in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of multiple sclerosis (MS) and then determine how CMH influences vascular integrity and the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms during EAE. We found that mice exposed to CMH at the same time as EAE induction were strongly protected against the development of EAE progression, as assessed both at the clinical level and at the histopathological level by reduced levels of inflammatory leukocyte infiltration, vascular breakdown and demyelination. Mechanistically, our studies indicate that CMH protects, at least in part, by enhancing several properties of blood vessels that contribute to vascular integrity, including reduced expression of the endothelial activation molecules VCAM-1 and ICAM-1, maintained expression of endothelial tight junction proteins ZO-1 and occludin, and upregulated expression of the leukocyte inhibitory protein laminin-111 in the vascular basement membrane. Taken together, these data suggest that optimization of BBB integrity is an important mechanism underlying the protective effect of hypoxic pre-conditioning.
