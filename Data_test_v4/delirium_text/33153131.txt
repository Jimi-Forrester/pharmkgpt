33153131|t|Abeta-Induced Damage Memory in hCMEC/D3 Cells Mediated by Sirtuin-1.
33153131|a|It is well accepted by the scientific community that the accumulation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) may be involved in endothelial dysfunction during Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression; however, anti-Abeta anti-bodies, which remove Abeta plaques, do not improve cerebrovascular function in AD animal models. The reasons for these paradoxical results require investigation. We hypothesized that Abeta exposure may cause persistent damage to cerebral endothelial cells even after Abeta is removed (referred to as cerebrovascular endothelial damage memory). In this study, we aimed to investigate whether cerebrovascular endothelial damage memory exists in endothelial cells. hCMEC/D3 cells were treated with Abeta1-42 for 12 h and then Abeta1-42 was withdrawn for another 12 h incubation to investigate whether cerebrovascular endothelial damage memory exists in endothelial cells. A mechanism-based kinetics progression model was developed to investigate the dynamic characters of the cerebrovascular endothelial damage. After Abeta1-42 was removed, the sirt-1 levels returned to normal but the cell vitality did not improve, which suggests that cerebrovascular endothelial damage memory may exist in endothelial cells. Sirt-1 activator SRT2104 and NAD+ (Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide) supplement may dose-dependently relieve the cerebrovascular endothelial damage memory. sirt-1 inhibitor EX527 may exacerbate the cerebrovascular endothelial damage memory. Kinetics analysis suggested that sirt-1 is involved in initiating the cerebrovascular endothelial damage memory; otherwise, NAD+ exhaustion plays a vital role in maintaining the cerebrovascular endothelial damage memory. This study provides a novel feature of cerebrovascular endothelial damage induced by Abeta.
