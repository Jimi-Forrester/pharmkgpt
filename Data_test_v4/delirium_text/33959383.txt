33959383|t|Super-Enhancers in the Regulation of Gene Transcription: General Aspects and Antitumor Targets.
33959383|a|Super-enhancers (genome elements that activate gene transcription) are DNA regions with an elevated concentration of transcriptional complexes. These multiprotein structures contain, among other components, the cyclin-dependent kinases 8 and 19. These and other transcriptional protein kinases are regarded as novel targets for pharmacological inhibition by antitumor drug candidates.
