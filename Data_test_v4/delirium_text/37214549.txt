37214549|t|Self-assembled short peptides: Recent advances and strategies for potential pharmaceutical applications.
37214549|a|Self-assembled short peptides have intrigued scientists due to the convenience of synthesis, good biocompatibility, low toxicity, inherent biodegradability and fast response to change in the physiological environment. Therefore, it is necessary to present a comprehensive summary of the recent advances in the last decade regarding the construction, route of administration and application of self-assembled short peptides based on the knowledge on their unique and specific ability of self-assembly. Herein, we firstly explored the molecular mechanisms of self-assembly of short peptides, such as non-modified amino acids, as well as Fmoc-modified, N-functionalized, and C-functionalized peptides. Next, cell penetration, fusion, and peptide targeting in peptide-based drug delivery were characterized. Then, the common administration routes and the potential pharmaceutical applications (drug delivery, antibacterial activity, stabilizers, imaging agents, and applications in bioengineering) of peptide drugs were respectively summarized. Last but not least, some general conclusions and future perspectives in the relevant fields were briefly listed. Although with certain challenges, great opportunities are offered by self-assembled short peptides to the fascinating area of drug development.
