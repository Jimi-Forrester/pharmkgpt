36501253|t|GC, GC/MS Analysis, and Biological Effects of Essential Oils from Thymus mastchina and Elettaria cardamomum.
36501253|a|Spanish marjoram (Thymus mastichina) and cardamom (Elettaria cardamomum) are traditional aromatic plants with which several pharmacological properties have been associated. In this study, the volatile composition, antioxidative and antimigratory effects on human breast cancer (MDA-MB-468 cell line), antimicrobial activity, and antibiofilm effect were evaluated. Results obtained via treatment of human breast cancer cells generally indicated an inhibitory effect of both essential oils (EOs) on cell viability (after long-term treatment) and antioxidative potential, as well as the reduction of nitric oxide levels. Antimigratory effects were revealed, suggesting that these EOs could possess significant antimetastatic properties and stop tumor progression and growth. The antimicrobial activities of both EOs were determined using the disc diffusion method and minimal inhibition concentration, while antibiofilm activity was evaluated by means of mass spectrometry. The best antimicrobial effects of T. mastichina EO were found against the yeast Candida glabrata and the G+ bacterium Listeria monocytogenes using the disc diffusion and minimal inhibitory concentration methods. E. cardamomum EO was found to be most effective against Pseudomas fluorescens biofilm using both methods. Similarly, better effects of this oil were observed on G- compared to G+ bacterial strains. Our study confirms that T. mastichina and E. cardamomum EOs act to change the protein structure of older P. fluorescens biofilms. The results underline the potential use of these EOs in manufactured products, such as foodstuffs, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals.
