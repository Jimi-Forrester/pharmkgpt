32742587|t|Sleep and the aging brain. A multifaceted approach.
32742587|a|In the current review we provide a theoretical background on studies examining the association between sleep and brain function. We focus on the association between sleep and cognitive performance, cognitive changes over time and incident dementia as well. We then present some data on the link between sleep and subjective cognitive complaints, in participants without any objective clinical cognitive decline. We conclude with investigating the association between sleep and brain biomarkers, by highlighting the importance of specific genes and specific brain regions' morphometry. The role of sleep is vital in maintaining a healthy aging brain, and multiple factors should be taken under account when investigating this association.
