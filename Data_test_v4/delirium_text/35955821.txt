35955821|t|Bidirectional Control between Cholesterol Shuttle and Purine Signal at the Central Nervous System.
35955821|a|Recent studies have highlighted the mechanisms controlling the formation of cerebral cholesterol, which is synthesized in situ primarily by astrocytes, where it is loaded onto apolipoproteins and delivered to neurons and oligodendrocytes through interactions with specific lipoprotein receptors. The "cholesterol shuttle" is influenced by numerous proteins or carbohydrates, which mainly modulate the lipoprotein receptor activity, function and signaling. These molecules, provided with enzymatic/proteolytic activity leading to the formation of peptide fragments of different sizes and specific sequences, could be also responsible for machinery malfunctions, which are associated with neurological, neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders. In this context, we have pointed out that purines, ancestral molecules acting as signal molecules and neuromodulators at the central nervous system, can influence the homeostatic machinery of the cerebral cholesterol turnover and vice versa. Evidence gathered so far indicates that purine receptors, mainly the subtypes P2Y2, P2X7 and A2A, are involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Niemann-Pick C diseases, by controlling the brain cholesterol homeostasis; in addition, alterations in cholesterol turnover can hinder the purine receptor function. Although the precise mechanisms of these interactions are currently poorly understood, the results here collected on cholesterol-purine reciprocal control could hopefully promote further research.
