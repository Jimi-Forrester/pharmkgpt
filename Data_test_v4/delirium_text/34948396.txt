34948396|t|Conformational Models of APP Processing by Gamma Secretase Based on Analysis of Pathogenic Mutations.
34948396|a|Proteolytic processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Sequential cleavage of APP by beta and gamma secretases leads to the generation of Abeta40 (non-amyloidogenic) and Abeta42 (amyloidogenic) peptides. Presenilin-1 (PS1) or presenilin-2 (PS2) play the role of a catalytic subunit of gamma-secretase. Multiple familial AD (FAD) mutations in APP, PS1, or PS2 result in an increased Abeta42:Abeta40 ratio and the accumulation of toxic Abeta42 oligomers and plaques in patient brains. In this study, we perform molecular modeling of the APP complex with gamma-secretase and analyze potential effects of FAD mutations in APP and PS1. We noticed that all FAD mutations in the APP transmembrane domain are predicted to cause an increase in the local disorder of its secondary structure. Based on structural analysis of known gamma-secretase structures, we propose that APP can form a complex with gamma-secretase in 2 potential conformations-M1 and M2. In conformation, the M1 transmembrane domain of APP forms a contact with the perimembrane domain that follows transmembrane domain 6 (TM6) in the PS1 structure. In conformation, the M2 transmembrane domain of APP forms a contact with transmembrane domain 7 (TM7) in the PS1 structure. By analyzing the effects of PS1-FAD mutations on the local protein disorder index, we discovered that these mutations increase the conformational flexibility of M2 and reduce the conformational flexibility of M1. Based on these results, we propose that M2 conformation, but not M1 conformation, of the gamma secretase complex with APP leads to the amyloidogenic (Abeta42-generating) processing of APP. Our model predicts that APP processing in M1 conformation is favored by curved membranes, such as the membranes of early endosomes. In contrast, APP processing in M2 conformation is likely to be favored by relatively flat membranes, such as membranes of late endosomes and plasma membranes. These predictions are consistent with published biochemical analyses of APP processing at different subcellular locations. Our results also suggest that specific inhibitors of Abeta42 production could be potentially developed by selectively targeting the M2 conformation of the gamma secretase complex with APP.
