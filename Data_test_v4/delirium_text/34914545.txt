34914545|a|PURPOSE: Mosunetuzumab is a bispecific antibody targeting CD20 and CD3 that redirects T cells to engage and eliminate malignant B cells and is being developed for relapsed or refractory (R/R) B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas (B-NHLs). METHODS: This first-in-human trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02500407) evaluated the safety and tolerability and efficacy of mosunetuzumab in patients with R/R B-NHL and established the recommended phase II dose. Data from dose escalation are presented. Single-agent mosunetuzumab was administered intravenously in 3-week cycles, at full dose in cycle 1 day 1 (group A) or with ascending (step-up) doses during cycle 1 on days 1, 8, and 15 (group B), for eight or 17 cycles on the basis of tumor response. RESULTS: Two hundred thirty patients were enrolled. Doses up to 2.8 mg and 60 mg were assessed in groups A and B, respectively; maximum tolerated dose was not exceeded. In group B (n = 197), common adverse events (>= 20% of patients) were neutropenia (28.4%), cytokine release syndrome (27.4%), hypophosphatemia (23.4%), fatigue (22.8%), and diarrhea (21.8%). Cytokine release syndrome was mostly low-grade (grade >= 3: 1.0%) and mainly confined to cycle 1. Across the doses investigated (group B), best overall response rates were 34.9% and 66.2% in patients with aggressive and indolent B-NHL, respectively, and complete response rates were 19.4% and 48.5%. Among patients with a complete response, the median duration of response was 22.8 months (95% CI, 7.6 to not estimable) and 20.4 (95% CI, 16 to not estimable) in patients with aggressive and indolent B-NHL, respectively. CONCLUSION: Mosunetuzumab, administered with step-up dosing, has a manageable safety profile and induces durable complete responses in R/R B-NHL. The expansion stage of the study is ongoing at the dose level of 1/2/60/60/30 mg selected for further study.
