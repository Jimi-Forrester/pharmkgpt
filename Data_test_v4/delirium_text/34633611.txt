34633611|t|Nectin-2 in general and in the brain.
34633611|a|Nectins are immunoglobulin-like cell adhesion molecules constituting a family with four members, nectin-1, nectin-2, nectin-3, and nectin-4. In the brain, nectin-2 as well as nectin-1 and nectin-3 are expressed whereas nectin-4 is hardly expressed. In the nervous system, physiological functions of nectin-1 and nectin-3, such as synapse formation, mossy fiber trajectory regulation, interneurite affinity, contextual fear memory formation, and stress-related mental disorders, have been revealed. Nectin-2 is ubiquitously expressed in non-neuronal tissues and various nectin-2 functions in non-nervous systems have been extensively investigated, but nectin-2 functions in the brain have not been revealed until recently. Recent findings have revealed that nectin-2 is expressed in the specific areas of the brain and plays important roles, such as homeostasis of astrocytes and neurons and the formation of synapses. Moreover, a single nucleotide polymorphism in the human NECTIN2 gene is associated with Alzheimer's disease. We here summarize recent progress in our understanding of nectin-2 functions in the brain.
