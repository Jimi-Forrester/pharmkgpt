37005885|a|BACKGROUND: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a prototype neuroinflammatory disorder with increasingly recognized role for neurodegeneration. Most first-line treatments cannot prevent the progression of neurodegeneration and the resultant disability. Interventions can improve symptoms of MS and might provide insights into the underlying pathology. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of intermittent caloric restriction on neuroimaging markers of MS. METHODS: We randomized ten participants with relapsing remitting MS to either a 12-week intermittent calorie restriction (iCR) diet (n = 5) or control (n = 5). Cortical thickness and volumes were measured through FreeSurfer, cortical perfusion was measured by arterial spin labeling and neuroinflammation through diffusion basis spectrum imaging. RESULTS: After 12 weeks of iCR, brain volume increased in the left superior and inferior parietal gyri (p: 0.050 and 0.049, respectively) and the banks of the superior temporal sulcus (p: 0.01). Similarly in the iCR group, cortical thickness improved in the bilateral medial orbitofrontal gyri (p: 0.04 and 0.05 in right and left, respectively), the left superior temporal gyrus (p: 0.03), and the frontal pole (p: 0.008) among others. Cerebral perfusion decreased in the bilateral fusiform gyri (p: 0.047 and 0.02 in right and left, respectively) and increased in the bilateral deep anterior white matter (p: 0.03 and 0.013 in right and left, respectively). Neuroinflammation, demonstrated through hindered and restricted water fractions (HF and RF), decreased in the left optic tract (HF p: 0.02), and the right extreme capsule (RF p: 0.007 and HF p: 0.003). CONCLUSION: These pilot data suggest therapeutic effects of iCR in improving cortical volume and thickness and mitigating neuroinflammation in midlife adults with MS.
