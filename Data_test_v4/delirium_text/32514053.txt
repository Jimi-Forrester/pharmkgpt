32514053|a|The vanilloid capsaicin is a widely consumed spice, known for its burning and "hot" sensation through activation of TRPV1 ion-channels, but also known to decrease oxidative stress, inflammation and influence tau-pathology. Beside these positive effects, little is known about its effects on amyloid-precursor-protein (APP) processing leading to amyloid-beta (Abeta), the major component of senile plaques. Treatment of neuroblastoma cells with capsaicinoids (24 hours, 10 microM) resulted in enhanced Abeta-production and reduced Abeta-degradation, leading to increased Abeta-levels. In detailed analysis of the amyloidogenic-pathway, both BACE1 gene-expression as well as protein-levels were found to be elevated, leading to increased beta-secretase-activity. Additionally, gamma-secretase gene-expression as well as activity was enhanced, accompanied by a shift of presenilin from non-raft to raft membrane-domains where amyloidogenic processing takes place. Furthermore, impaired Abeta-degradation in presence of capsaicinoids is dependent on the insulin-degrading-enzyme, one of the major Abeta-degrading-enzymes. Regarding Abeta-homeostasis, no differences were found between the major capsaicinoids, capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin, and a mixture of naturally derived capsaicinoids; effects on Ca2+-homeostasis were ruled out. Our results show that in respect to Alzheimer's disease, besides the known positive effects of capsaicinoids, pro-amyloidogenic properties also exist, enhancing Abeta-levels, likely restricting the potential use of capsaicinoids as therapeutic substances in Alzheimer's disease.
