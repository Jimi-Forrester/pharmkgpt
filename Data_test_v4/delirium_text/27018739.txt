27018739|a|This article describes the development of a toolkit for interdisciplinary team members to use to improve care for people with dementia or delirium in a hospice inpatient unit. An occupational therapist and two nurses identified that caring for the increasing number of people with dementia and delirium in the unit was a challenge for staff. The authors took a collaborative quality improvement approach to address the problem, engaging both the hospice interdisciplinary team and external community partners. The overall aim was to establish, reinforce and maintain best practice of care for people with a cognitive impairment within the Mary Potter Hospice short stay (average admission 11 days) environment, which the authors believe is a largely unexplored venture in a hospice inpatient unit setting.
