36985848|t|Effect of Different Time/Temperature Binomials on the Chemical Features, Antioxidant Activity, and Natural Microbial Load of Olive Pomace Paste.
36985848|a|Olive pomace is a by-product from olive oil production that can be further processed to obtain olive pomace paste. In this work, the influence of different time/temperature binomials (65  C/30 min; 77  C/1 min; 88  C/15 s; and 120  C/20 min) on the nutritional quality, chemical composition, and efficiency on control/elimination of natural microbial load of olive pomace paste was ascertained. The treatments significantly impacted the contents of ash, fat, vitamin E, phenolics (including hydroxytyrosol), flavonoids, and antioxidant activity, but not the fatty acids profile. The binomial 88  C/15 s showed the greatest potential since it better preserved the phytochemical and antioxidant properties as well as the protein and fiber contents. This binomial is also faster and easy to be implemented at an industrial level, allowing the obtention of a safe functional ingredient to satisfy consumers' demands for novel sustainable products, simultaneously, responding to food safety and food security concerns.
