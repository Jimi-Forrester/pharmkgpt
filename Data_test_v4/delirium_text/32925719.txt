32925719|t|Association between Helicobacter pylori infection and the risk of colorectal cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis.
32925719|a|BACKGROUND: The existing evidence on the relationship between Helicobacter pylori infection and the risk of colorectal cancer is inconsistent. We conducted a systematic review with a meta-analysis to explore this relationship and to determine whether the relationship varies according to the study characteristics. METHODS: We searched the PubMed, OVID, EMBASE database, and the reference lists of pertinent articles published up to October 2019 by 2 researchers independently. Summary odds ratios (OR) with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using a random-effects model. RESULTS: Forty seven studies including 17,416 cases of colorectal cancer (CRC) and 55,811 cases of control were included. Overall, H. pylori infection was associated with an increased risk of CRC (OR = 1.70 95% CI 1.64-1.76, I = 97%), although there was significant heterogeneity among the studies. Subgroup analysis revealed that the positive correlation might vary by the design of study conducted. CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis demonstrates a positive association between H. pylori infection and the risk of colorectal cancer.
