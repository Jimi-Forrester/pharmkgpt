39425809|a|OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to describe the clinical presentation of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients aged 80 or above and to identify predictors for death and complications throughout the epidemic waves of the disease. METHODS: This was an observational, multicenter, ambispective study conducted between March 2020 and August 2021 using data collected in five centers from southern metropolitan area of Barcelona (COVID-MetroSud cohort). Patients were grouped based on the pandemic waves of inclusion in the registry. We conducted a descriptive analysis, followed by bivariate and multivariate analyses (binary logistic regression) to identify predictors of risk for death or complications. RESULTS: A total of 1192 patients (mean [SD] age 85.7 [4.22] years and 46.8% female) were included. The most frequently reported symptoms in all waves were fever (63.1%), cough (56.5%), dyspnea (48.2%), and asthenia (27.5%). Laboratory and radiological findings consistently showed abnormal bilateral chest X-ray results (72.5% of patients) and elevated inflammatory markers such as lactate dehydrogenase (mean [SD] 335 [188] U/L), C-reactive protein (CRP) (mean [SD] 110 [88.4] U/L), and ferritin (mean [SD] 842 [1561] U/L). Acute respiratory distress syndrome (43.7%), renal failure (19.2%), and delirium (17.5%) were the most frequent complications. The overall mortality rate was 41.4% and declined across the epidemic waves. Age, diabetes mellitus, heart failure, dyspnea, and higher baseline levels of creatinine were identified as risk factors for complications, while a higher Barthel index and presence of cough were found to be protective. Age, dyspnea, abnormal bilateral chest X-ray, CRP, and sodium were identified as risk factors for death. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the clinical presentation of COVID-19 (fever, cough, dyspnea, and asthenia) and the different risk factors for mortality and complications in octogenarian hospitalized patients throughout the pandemic. These findings could be highly valuable for managing future virus pandemics.
