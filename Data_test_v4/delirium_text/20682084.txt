20682084|t|The role of animal models in advancing amyloid-beta immunotherapy to the clinic.
20682084|a|The amyloid-beta (Abeta) hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) causality is now well into its third decade and is finally entering a phase of rigorous clinical testing in numerous late stage clinical trials. The use of Abeta-based animal models of AD has been essential to the discovery and/or preclinical validation of many of these therapeutic approaches. While several neuropathologically based results from preclinical studies have translated nicely into AD patients, the full clinical value of Abeta-directed therapies awaits results from trials now in progress.
