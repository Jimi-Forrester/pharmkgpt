34205102|t|TGF-beta/Smad Signalling in Neurogenesis: Implications for Neuropsychiatric Diseases.
34205102|a|TGF-beta/Smad signalling has been the subject of extensive research due to its role in the cell cycle and carcinogenesis. Modifications to the TGF-beta/Smad signalling pathway have been found to produce disparate effects on neurogenesis. We review the current research on canonical and non-canonical TGF-beta/Smad signalling pathways and their functions in neurogenesis. We also examine the observed role of neurogenesis in neuropsychiatric disorders and the relationship between TGF-beta/Smad signalling and neurogenesis in response to stressors. Overlapping mechanisms of cell proliferation, neurogenesis, and the development of mood disorders in response to stressors suggest that TGF-beta/Smad signalling is an important regulator of stress response and is implicated in the behavioural outcomes of mood disorders.
