38810401|t|Neuroprotective effects of Anshen Bunao Syrup on cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease rat models.
38810401|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) presents a significant challenge due to its prevalence and lack of cure, driving the quest for effective treatments. Anshen Bunao Syrup, a traditional Chinese medicine known for its neuroprotective properties, shows promise in addressing this need. However, understanding its precise mechanisms in AD remains elusive. This study aimed to investigate Anshen Bunao Syrup's therapeutic potential in AD treatment using a scopolamine-induced AD rat model. Assessments included novel-object recognition and Morris water maze tasks to evaluate spatial learning and memory, alongside Nissl staining and ELISA analyses for neuronal damage and biomarker levels. Results demonstrated that Anshen Bunao Syrup effectively mitigated cognitive dysfunction by inhibiting amyloid-beta and phosphorylation Tau aggregation, thereby reducing neuronal damage. Metabolomics profiling of rats cortex revealed alterations in key metabolites implicated in tryptophan and fatty acid metabolism pathways, suggesting a role in the therapeutic effects of Anshen Bunao Syrup. Additionally, ELISA and correlation analyses indicated attenuation of oxidative stress and immune response through metabolic remodeling. In conclusion, this study provides compelling evidence for the neuroprotective effects of Anshen Bunao Syrup in AD models, shedding light on its potential as a therapeutic agent for AD prevention and treatment.
