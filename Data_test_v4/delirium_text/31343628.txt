31343628|t|Primary Prevention to Maintain Cognition and Prevent Acute Delirium Following Orthopaedic Surgery.
31343628|a|Cognitive impairment is a recognized predictor of acute delirium, particularly in the postoperative period. Estimates of up to 24% of patients experiencing delirium and its associated cognitive impairment during any orthopaedic procedure have been reported, with higher rates for those patients undergoing hip fracture repair. Primary prevention is the most effective strategy to maintain cognition and prevent delirium. The purpose of this article is to provide evidence-based recommendations to prevent acute delirium using bundles of care. Bundles of care are a set of 3-5 independent, evidence-based interventions that, when implemented together, result in significantly better outcomes than when implemented individually. The bundle consists of ongoing assessment of cognition, continuing orientation, and early mobilization and socialization.
