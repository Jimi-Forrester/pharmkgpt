11889831|t|[An autopsy case of dementia with motor neuron disease accompanying Alzheimer's disease lesion].
11889831|a|We report the case of a 60-year-old man with autopsy-proven dementia with motor neuron disease (D-MND) and Alzheimer's disease lesion. The patient presented with clumsiness of his right hand at the age of 55 years old and subsequently developed dysarthria, weakness and atrophy of his upper limbs. He was unaffectionate towards his family, repeated the same phrase, and showed severe disorientation of time and place. Neurological examination on admission showed not only diffuse lower motor neuron signs, such as weakness, atrophy, fasciculation and areflexia in both upper limbs, but also dementia (HDS-R 9/30). He died of respiratory insufficiency. Neuropathological examination showed mild atrophy of the frontal and temporal lobes and anterior spinal roots. Microscopic examination of cortical sections revealed degenerative changes with simple atrophy and gliosis, and these changes were predominant in layers 1 and 2 of the frontal and temporal cortices. Using immunohistochemical staining, ubiquitin-positive but tau-negative inclusions were frequently found in neurons of the hippocampal granular cell layers and temporal lobes. Many senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles were present in all sections of the brain. Our final diagnosis was dementia with motor neuron disease accompanying Alzheimer's disease lesion, because of hypoperfusion in the parietal lobe as well as the frontal lobe demonstrated by SPECT, and the presence of many senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the cerebral cortex. Overlapping of pathologically-proven D-MND and Alzheimer's disease lesion is extremely rare, and this case may improve our understanding of the process of neurodegeneration.
