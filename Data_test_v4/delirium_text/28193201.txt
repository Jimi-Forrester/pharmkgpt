28193201|t|An artificial neural networks approach for assessment treatment response in oncological patients using PET/CT images.
28193201|a|BACKGROUND: Positron Emission Tomography - Computed Tomography (PET/CT) imaging is the basis for the evaluation of response-to-treatment of several oncological diseases. In practice, such evaluation is manually performed by specialists, which is rather complex and time-consuming. Evaluation measures have been proposed, but with questionable reliability. The usage of before and after-treatment image descriptors of the lesions for treatment response evaluation is still a territory to be explored. METHODS: In this project, Artificial Neural Network approaches were implemented to automatically assess treatment response of patients suffering from neuroendocrine tumors and Hodgkyn lymphoma, based on image features extracted from PET/CT. RESULTS: The results show that the considered set of features allows for the achievement of very high classification performances, especially when data is properly balanced. CONCLUSIONS: After synthetic data generation and PCA-based dimensionality reduction to only two components, LVQNN assured classification accuracies of 100%, 100%, 96.3% and 100% regarding the 4 response-to-treatment classes.
