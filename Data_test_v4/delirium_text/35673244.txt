35673244|t|Addressing Mental Health Factors to Improve Outcomes in Work-Related COVID-19: A Retrospective Study of Frontline Workers.
35673244|a|OBJECTIVE: This retrospective study investigated the benefits of adding psychological services for frontline workers with delayed recovery from COVID-19 due to psychosocial stressors and/or mental disorders. METHODS: Both standardized psychological evaluation and at least 3 sessions of work-focused cognitive behavioral therapy were provided to 103 participants. Benefits were assessed by comparing the pretreatment and posttreatment recovery, work status, and self-ratings of work-related and adaptive daily functioning. RESULTS: Duration of recovery and return to work were reduced along with improvements in work relevant (40%) and adaptive functioning (31%). The majority (80%) returned to work within 12 weeks despite variable presenting problems, course of illness, demographic, and job factors. CONCLUSIONS: Brief work-focused cognitive behavioral therapy seems to be an effective adjunct to customary outpatient medical care for COVID-19 in frontline essential workers for whom the return-to-work process may be negatively affected by stress, anxiety, and depressed mood.
