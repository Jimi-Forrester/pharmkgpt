33624140|t|Mitochondrial PKA Is Neuroprotective in a Cell Culture Model of Alzheimer's Disease.
33624140|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive memory loss and cognitive decline. In hippocampal neurons, the pathological features of AD include the accumulation of extracellular amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) accompanied by oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neuron loss. A decrease in neuroprotective Protein Kinase A (PKA) signaling contributes to mitochondrial fragmentation and neurodegeneration in AD. By associating with the protein scaffold Dual-Specificity Anchoring Protein 1 (D-AKAP1), PKA is targeted to mitochondria to promote mitochondrial fusion by phosphorylating the fission modulator dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1). We hypothesized that (1) a decrease in the endogenous level of endogenous D-AKAP1 contributes to decreased PKA signaling in mitochondria and that (2) restoring PKA signaling in mitochondria can reverse neurodegeneration and mitochondrial fragmentation in neurons in AD models. Through immunohistochemistry, we showed that endogenous D-AKAP1, but not other mitochondrial proteins, is significantly reduced in primary neurons treated with Abeta42 peptide (10muM, 24 h), and in the hippocampus and cortex from asymptomatic and symptomatic AD mice (5X-FAD). Transiently expressing wild-type, but not a PKA-binding deficient mutant of D-AKAP1, was able to reduce mitochondrial fission, dendrite retraction, and apoptosis in primary neurons treated with Abeta42. Mechanistically, the protective effects of D-AKAP1/PKA are moderated through PKA-mediated phosphorylation of Drp1, as transiently expressing a PKA phosphomimetic mutant of Drp1 (Drp1-S656D) phenocopies D-AKAP1's ability to reduce Abeta42-mediated apoptosis and mitochondrial fission. Overall, our data suggest that a loss of D-AKAP1/PKA contributes to mitochondrial pathology and neurodegeneration in an in vitro cell culture model of AD.
