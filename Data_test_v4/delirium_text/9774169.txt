9774169|t|Beta-amyloid (1-42) peptide impairs blood-brain barrier function after intracarotid infusion in rats.
9774169|a|The effects of intracarotid infusions of beta-amyloid (1-42) peptide was studied on the permeability of brain vessels. Using a quantitative Evans blue method a dose-dependent increase of brain tissue albumin content was established following intracarotid injections of the peptide. Cerebral vessels of increased permeability were also demonstrated with a vital 'staining' technique. Lectin histochemistry revealed an almost complete abolition of specific lectin binding sites of affected endothelial cells. The findings indicate a significant deterioration by beta-amyloid (1-42) peptide of blood-brain barrier function and suggest that this may result from endothelial damage. It is assumed that altered permeability of cerebral vessels may be involved in the development of brain pathologies associated with Alzheimer's disease.
