32319235|t|Recommended Strategies for Physician Burnout, a Well-Recognized Escalating Global Crisis Among Neurologists.
32319235|a|Several indexes are used to classify physician burnout, with the Maslach Burnout Inventory currently being the most widely accepted. This index measures physician burnout based on emotional exhaustion, detachment from work, and lack of personal achievement. The overall percentage of physicians with burnout is estimated to be around 40%, but the proportion varies between specialties. Neurology currently has the second-highest rate of burnout and is projected to eventually take the top position. The purpose of this review is to provide a comprehensive overview focusing on the causes and ramifications of burnout and possible strategies for addressing the crisis. Several factors contribute to burnout among neurologist, including psychological trauma associated with patient care and a lack of respect compared to other specialties. Various interventions have been proposed for reducing burnout, and this article explores the feasibility of some of them. Burnout not only impacts the physician but also has adverse effects on the overall quality of patient care and places a strain on the health-care system. Burnout has only recently been recognized and accepted as a health crisis globally, and hence most of the proposed action plans have not been validated. More studies are needed to evaluate the long-term effects of such interventions.
