36092169|t|MORTALITY IN PATIENTS > 90 YEARS OLD WITH PROXIMAL FEMORAL FRACTURES SUBJECTED TO SURGERY.
36092169|a|Introduction: Proximal femoral fractures have a high mortality rate among older adults, especially those aged > 80 years. Objective: To analyze predictive factors for hospital or late mortality of patients > 90 years old who showed proximal femoral fracture and subjected to surgery. Methods: The study included data from 230 patients aged > 90 years diagnosed with proximal femoral fracture and who underwent surgery between January and December 2017. The statistical evaluation was performed by multivariate analysis by a logistic regression. The associations were estimated by the odds ratio (OD) and confidence interval (95%). Statistical significance was determined with p < 0.05. Results: Late death occurred in 51.3% (118 patients) of the sample and hospital death in 3.5% (8 patients). Most patients were women (83.5%) and the most common fracture was transtrochanteric (57.0%). There was association between late death and the surgery duration (p < 0.05), and between hospital death and the presence of heart diseases (p < 0.05) or endocrinopathies (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Most patients aged > 90 years with proximal femoral fracture subjected to surgery died in less than one year. Late death was associated with the surgery duration and hospital death was associated with the presence of previous endocrinopathies or heart diseases, and the female gender was a protective factor from this outcome. Level of Evidence III, Retrospective Case-Control Study.
