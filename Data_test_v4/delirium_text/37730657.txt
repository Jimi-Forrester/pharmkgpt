37730657|t|Facial nerve neurographies in intensive care unit-acquired weakness.
37730657|a|BACKGROUND: Patients with an intensive care unit-acquired weakness (ICU-AW) often present clinically with severe paresis of the limb and trunk muscles while facial muscles appear less affected. To investigate whether the facial nerves are partially spared from this condition, we performed both peripheral and cranial nerve conduction studies in critically ill patients. METHODS: In patients requiring prolonged ICU therapy, the motor and sensory nerve conduction velocities of the peroneal, ulnar and facial nerves and the muscle action potentials of the associated muscles, as well as the orbicularis oculi reflexes were assessed shortly after admission, and on ICU days 7 and 14. RESULTS: Eighteen patients were included in the final data analysis (average age 54.2 +- 16.8 years, 8 females). The amplitudes of the peroneal nerve compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs) were reduced in all patients at ICU days 7 and 14 (F(1.39; 23.63) = 13.85; p < 0.001). There was no similar decrease in the CMAP amplitudes of the ulnar or facial nerve. Other parameters of nerve function (latencies, sensory and motor nerve conduction velocities, sensory nerve action potentials) remained unchanged. The reproducibility of the orbicularis oculi reflex was reduced during the disease course, while its latencies did not change significantly during the disease course. CONCLUSIONS: There is a relative preservation of CMAPs in facial and hand as opposed to foot muscles. This is compatible with the clinical observation that the facial muscles in patients with ICU-AW are less severely affected. This may be primarily a function of the nerve length, and consequently more robust trophic factors in shorter nerves. Trial registration This study was prospectively registered in the German Clinical Trial Register on April 20th 2020 (DRKS00021467).
