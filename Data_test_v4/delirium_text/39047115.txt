39047115|t|Flortaucipir PET uncovers relationships between tau and amyloid-beta in primary age-related tauopathy and Alzheimer's disease.
39047115|a|[18F]-Flortaucipir positron emission tomography (PET) is considered a good biomarker of Alzheimer's disease. However, it is unknown how flortaucipir is associated with the distribution of tau across brain regions and how these associations are influenced by amyloid-beta. It is also unclear whether flortaucipir can detect tau in definite primary age-related tauopathy (PART). We identified 248 individuals at Mayo Clinic who had undergone [18F]-flortaucipir PET during life, had died, and had undergone an autopsy, 239 cases of which also had amyloid-beta PET. We assessed nonlinear relationships between flortaucipir uptake in nine medial temporal and cortical regions, Braak tau stage, and Thal amyloid-beta phase using generalized additive models. We found that flortaucipir uptake was greater with increasing tau stage in all regions. Increased uptake at low tau stages in medial temporal regions was only observed in cases with a high amyloid-beta phase. Flortaucipir uptake linearly increased with the amyloid-beta phase in medial temporal and cortical regions. The highest flortaucipir uptake occurred with high Alzheimer's disease neuropathologic change (ADNC) scores, followed by low-intermediate ADNC scores, then PART, with the entorhinal cortex providing the best differentiation between groups. Flortaucipir PET had limited ability to detect PART, and imaging-defined PART did not correspond with pathologically defined PART. In summary, spatial patterns of flortaucipir mirrored the histopathological tau distribution, were influenced by the amyloid-beta phase, and were useful for distinguishing different ADNC scores and PART.
