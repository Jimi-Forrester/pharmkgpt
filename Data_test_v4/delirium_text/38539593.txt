38539593|a|Little is known about the brain correlates of anosognosia or unawareness of disease in Parkinson's Disease (PD) and Huntington's Disease (HD). The presence of unawareness or impaired self-awareness (ISA) of illness has profound implications for patients and their caregivers; therefore, studying awareness and its brain correlates should be considered a key step towards developing effective recognition and management of this symptom as it offers a window into the mechanism of self-awareness and consciousness as critical components of the human cognition. We reviewed research studies adopting MRI or other in vivo neuroimaging technique to assess brain structural and/or functional correlates of unawareness in PD and HD across different cognitive and motor domains. Studies adopting task or resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging, and/or 18-F fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography brain imaging and/or magnetic resonance imaging structural measures were considered. Only six studies investigating neuroimaging features of unawareness in PD and two in HD were identified; there was great heterogeneity in the clinical characteristics of the study participants, domain of unawareness investigated, method of unawareness assessment, and neuroimaging technique used. Nevertheless, some data converge in identifying regions of the salience and frontoparietal networks to be associated with unawareness in PD patients. In HD, the few data are affected by the variability in the severity of motor symptoms. Further studies are needed to better understand the mechanisms and brain correlates of unawareness in PD and HD; in addition, the use of dopaminergic medications should be carefully considered.
