37932982|a|BACKGROUND: Emergence agitation (EA) is a common complication in pediatric anesthesia, especially in preschool children maintained by sevoflurane, with incidence ranging up to 80%. The purpose of the study was to determine whether sucking lollipop after awakening from sevoflurane anesthesia reduced the degree of EA in children undergoing ambulatory surgery. METHODS: In this prospective study, 40 children aged 2 to 6 years scheduled for ambulatory surgery with sevoflurane were enrolled. They were randomly allocated to 1 of 2 groups after evaluating baseline EA levels using the pediatric anesthesia emergence delirium (PAED) scale immediately after awakening from general anesthesia: group L (sucking lollipop) or group C (control group, without sucking lollipop). The primary outcome was the overall PAED score after intervention. Pain score, parental satisfaction, the incidence of propofol rescue and negative postoperative behavioral changes (NPOBCs) were assessed. RESULTS: The overall PAED score after intervention was significantly lower in Group L compared with Group C, with an estimated difference of -1.857 (95% CI, -2.884 to -0.831; P < .001) using generalized estimating equations. However, no significant intergroup differences were observed in the pain score, parental satisfaction, the incidence of propofol rescue and NPOBCs. CONCLUSIONS: Sucking lollipop after awakening from sevoflurane anesthesia reduced the degree EA in children undergoing ambulatory surgery.
