34203368|t|CD47 in the Brain and Neurodegeneration: An Update on the Role in Neuroinflammatory Pathways.
34203368|a|CD47 is a receptor belonging to the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily and broadly expressed on cell membranes. Through interactions with ligands such as SIRPalpha, TSP-1, integrins, and SH2-domain bearing protein tyrosine phosphatase substrate-1 (SHPS-1), CD47 regulates numerous functions like cell adhesion, proliferation, apoptosis, migration, homeostasis, and the immune system. In this aspect, previous research has shown that CD47 modulates phagocytosis via macrophages, the transmigration of neutrophils, and the activation of T-cells, dendritic cells, and B-cells. Moreover, several studies have reported the increased expression of the CD47 receptor in a variety of diseases, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), chronic myeloid leukemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), multiple myeloma (MM), bladder cancer, acute myeloid leukemia (AML), Gaucher disease, Multiple Sclerosis and stroke among others. The ubiquitous expression of the CD47 cell receptor on most resident cells of the CNS has previously been established through different methodologies. However, there is little information concerning its precise functions in the development of different neurodegenerative pathologies in the CNS. Consequently, further research pertaining to the specific functions and roles of CD47 and SIRP is required prior to its exploitation as a druggable approach for the targeting of various neurodegenerative diseases that affect the human population. The present review attempts to summarize the role of both CD47 and SIRP and their therapeutic potential in neurodegenerative disorders.
