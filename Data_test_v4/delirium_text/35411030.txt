35411030|a|Inflammation is a defense mechanism that can protect the host against microbe invasion. A proper inflammatory response can maintain homeostasis, but continuous inflammation can cause many chronic inflammatory diseases. To properly treat inflammatory disorders, the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of inflammation need to be fully elucidated. Pyroptosis is an inflammation-related cell death program, that is different from other types of cell death. Pyroptosis plays crucial roles in host defense against infections through the release of proinflammatory cytokines and cell lysis. Accumulating evidence indicates that pyroptosis is associated with inflammatory diseases, such as arthritis, pneumonia, and colonitis. Furthermore, pyroptosis is also closely involved in cancers that develop as a result of inflammation, such as liver cancer, esophageal cancer, pancreatic cancer, and colon cancer. Here, we review the function and mechanism of pyroptosis in inflammatory disease development and provide a comprehensive description of the potential role of pyroptosis in inflammatory diseases.
