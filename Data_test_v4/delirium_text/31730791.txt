31730791|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a serious neurodegenerative disease. Senile plaques (SPs) composed of amyloid-beta (Abeta) are typical features of AD. Abeta plays a key role in the disease and has the ability to induce other pathological characteristics of AD, including oxidative stress injury. (m)VD-hemopressin (VD), a peptide derived from mouse brain extracts, can bind cannabinoid 1 receptor (CB1R) as an agonist. Our previous report indicated that VD reverses memory impairment induced by Abeta1-42 in mice. This study aimed to clarify the mechanism by which VD protects hippocampal neurons against Abeta1-42-induced impairment. Our results showed that VD inhibited oxidative stress injury induced by Abeta1-42, as demonstrated by the VD-induced reversal of the upregulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the intracellular lipid peroxidation product malondialdehyde (MDA) and the downregulation of the activities of the antioxidative enzymes catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) in mouse hippocampal neurons. We also found that VD restored the decrease in cell growth and viability induced by Abeta1-42 and reversed Abeta1-42-induced apoptosis mediated by the apoptosis-associated proteins Bcl-2 and Bax. However, cotreatment with AM251 (an antagonist of CB1R) blocked the effects of VD. In brief, this study suggested that through CB1R, VD reversed the impairment of cell growth and viability, oxidative stress injury and apoptosis induced by Abeta1-42. Therefore, VD may be a promising agent for the treatment of diseases that involve oxidative stress injury and apoptosis induced by Abeta1-42, such as AD.
