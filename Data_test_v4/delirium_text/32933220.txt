32933220|t|The Relevance of Thiamine Evaluation in a Practical Setting.
32933220|a|Thiamine is a crucial cofactor involved in the maintenance of carbohydrate metabolism and participates in multiple cellular metabolic processes. Although thiamine can be obtained from various food sources, some common food groups are deficient in thiamine, and it can be denatured by high temperature and pH. Additionally, different drugs can alter thiamine metabolism. In addition, the half-life of thiamine in the body is between 1 and 3 weeks. All these factors could provide an explanation for the relatively short period needed to develop thiamine deficiency and observe the consequent clinical symptoms. Thiamine deficiency could lead to neurological and cardiological problems. These clinical conditions could be severe or even fatal. Marginal deficiency too may promote weaker symptoms that might be overlooked. Patients undergoing upper gastrointestinal or pancreatic surgery could have or develop thiamine deficiency for many different reasons. To achieve the best outcome for these patients, we strongly recommend the execution of both an adequate preoperative nutritional assessment, which includes thiamine evaluation, and a close nutritional follow up to avoid a nutrient deficit in the postoperative period.
