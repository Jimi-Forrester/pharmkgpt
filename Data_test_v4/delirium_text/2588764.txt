2588764|t|[Normal pressure hydrocephalus in geriatric patients--a treatable form of dementia].
2588764|a|Six geriatric patients are presented who were treated because of normal pressure hydrocephalus. A tentative diagnosis was made if dementia, gait disturbance, and incontinence together with a typical CAT-scan were present. In these cases an operation was carried out. After ventriculo-peritoneal shunting clinical improvements were seen in four patients. Postoperative complications were hygromas in three patients and a shunt-dislocation in another patient. A chronic subdural bleeding was recorded also in one of these patients with only a temporary success in this case. Two patients showed no clinical improvement at any time. However, in these cases additional neurologic symptoms together with typical CAT-scan changes were present. Before making a decision for an operation vascular processes and Alzheimer's disease should be ruled out.
