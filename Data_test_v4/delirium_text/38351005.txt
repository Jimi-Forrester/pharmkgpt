38351005|t|Cryo-EM structures of lipidic fibrils of amyloid-beta (1-40).
38351005|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive and incurable neurodegenerative disease characterized by the extracellular deposition of amyloid plaques. Investigation into the composition of these plaques revealed a high amount of amyloid-beta (Abeta) fibrils and a high concentration of lipids, suggesting that fibril-lipid interactions may also be relevant for the pathogenesis of AD. Therefore, we grew Abeta40 fibrils in the presence of lipid vesicles and determined their structure by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to high resolution. The fold of the major polymorph is similar to the structure of brain-seeded fibrils reported previously. The majority of the lipids are bound to the fibrils, as we show by cryo-EM and NMR spectroscopy. This apparent lipid extraction from vesicles observed here in vitro provides structural insights into potentially disease-relevant fibril-lipid interactions.
