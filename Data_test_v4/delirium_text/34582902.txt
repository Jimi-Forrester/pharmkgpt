34582902|a|BACKGROUND: Pain management in hip fracture patients is of great importance for reducing postoperative morbidity and mortality. Multimodal techniques, including peripheral nerve blocks, are preferred for postoperative analgesia. Older-old hip fracture patients with high ASA scores are highly sensitive to the side effects of NSAIDs and opioids. Our aim was to investigate the effectiveness of the recently popularized Supra-Inguinal Fascia Iliaca Block (SIFIB) in this population. METHODS: Forty-one ASA III-IV patients who underwent SIFIB + PCA (G-SIFIB) or PCA alone (Group Control: GC) after general anesthesia were evaluated retrospectively. In addition to 24-hour opioid consumption, Visual Analog Scale (VAS) scores, opioid-related side effects, block-related complications, and length of hospital stay were compared. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients in G-SIFIB and 19 patients in GC were evaluated. The postoperative 24-hour opioid consumption was lower in G-SIFIB than in GC (p < 0.001). There was a statistically significant reduction in VAS scores at the postoperative 1st, 3rd, and 6th hours at rest (p < 0.001) and during movement (p < 0.001 for the 1st and 3rd hours, and p = 0.02 for the 6th hour) in G-SIFIB compared to GC. There was no difference in pain scores at the 12th and 24th hours postoperatively. While there was no difference between the groups in terms of other side effects, respiratory depression was significantly higher in GC than in G-SIFIB (p = 0.01). CONCLUSION: The SIFIB technique has a significant opioid-sparing effect and thus reduces opioid-related side effects in the first 24 hours after hip fracture surgery in older-old patients.
