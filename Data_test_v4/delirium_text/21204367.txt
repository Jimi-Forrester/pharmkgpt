21204367|a|The importance of cholinergic activity in the brain to learning and memory function was first recognized more than 30 years ago, when relatively low doses of certain muscarinic acetylcholine-receptor antagonists (e.g., the belladonna alkaloids atropine and scopolamine) were found to induce transient cognitive deficits in young human volunteers that resembled those observed in elderly (unmedicated) subjects [1]. This work and a number of subsequent clinical studies indicated that antimuscarinics disrupt attention [2-4], the acquisition of new information, and the consolidation of memory [1,4,5]. Later studies found that scopolamine could alter certain features of the human electroencephalogram (e.g., delta, theta, alpha, and beta activity) in a fashion that mimics some of the changes observed in patients with Alzheimer s disease (AD) (reviewed by Ebert and Kirch [6]). In support of these cited pharmacological investigations, a considerable number of studies of the brains of elderly people and of AD patients have shown damage or abnormalities in forebrain cholinergic projections that are important to memory structures (e.g., cortex, hippocampus), and these results correlate well with the level of cognitive decline [7,8]. Interestingly, scopolamine appears to negatively affect cognitive performance to a greater extent in elderly subjects than in younger subjects [9-11], and it impairs subjects with AD more dramatically than nondemented elderly subjects [12]. Similarly, aged rodents display cognitive impairments in many learning and memory tasks [13], manifest cholinergic deficits [14-16], and are more sensitive to the disruptive effects of scopolamine than young rats [16]. Moreover, lesions in young animals that damage cholinergic input from the basal forebrain (e.g., nucleus basalis magnocellularis, medial septum/diagonal band) to the neocortex or hippocampus disrupt performance of a variety of memory-related tasks. These findings, particularly the early studies cited, led to the development of the so-called cholinergic hypothesis, which essentially states that a loss of cholinergic function in the central nervous system (CNS) contributes significantly to the cognitive decline associated with advanced age and AD (reviewed by Bartus [17]). Using this hypothesis as a guiding principle, scopolamine (and to a lesser extent other antimuscarinic agents) has been used extensively as an amnestic drug in animals to model the cognitive dysfunction associated with human dementia and Alzheimer s disease. While a few studies have been conducted using scopolamine as an amnestic agent in nonhuman primates (e.g., Aigner and Mishkin [18] and Terry et al. [19]), the majority of studies have been conducted in rodents, particularly rats. In addition, scopolamine-reversal experiments in rodents have been used extensively as an initial screening method to identify therapeutic candidates for cognitive disorders such as AD.
