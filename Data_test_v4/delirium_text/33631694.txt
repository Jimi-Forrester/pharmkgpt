33631694|a|OBJECTIVE: Due to the global spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), guidance for the use of psychotropic drugs in this context is necessary. We aimed to review clinical evidence regarding the potential toxicity of psychiatric medications in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: A systematic search for all types of empirical studies and reviews in a broad set of electronic databases and trial registries was conducted up to the 15th of August 2020. RESULTS: We identified 3 case series and 4 single-case reports on the occurrence of toxicity induced by various psychotropic drugs (lithium, n = 2; clozapine, n = 5; risperidone n = 2; haloperidol n = 1; duloxetine, n = 1). In addition, we provide a new case report on the possible precipitation of valproic acid-induced hyperammonemic encephalopathy. In most cases, SARS-CoV-2 infection may have precipitated drug toxicity/side effects. The management of toxicity did not diverge from the usually applied principles in the absence of infection. CONCLUSIONS: Due to the limited available evidence and the recent genomic diversity and evolution of the SARS-CoV-2, it is currently not possible to derive evidence-based recommendations for the use of psychotropic drugs in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nevertheless, we provide some guidance based on the reviewed literature. At the current state of knowledge, there is no contraindication for any psychotropic drug. Caution is warranted regarding the dosing and, in particular, the monitoring of clozapine, lithium and valproate.
