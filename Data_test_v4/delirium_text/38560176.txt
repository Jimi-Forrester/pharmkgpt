38560176|a|Introduction: Simultaneous involvement of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and central nervous system (CNS) during the same period in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is rarely documented. In this particular case, the diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma was pathologically confirmed, with invasion into the basal ganglia, diencephalon, and several peripheral nerves. The initial clinical manifestations were dyspnoea and hyperventilation. Case presentation: The patient presented to the hospital with fatigue, dyspnoea, and limb pain for over 7 months, accompanied by progressive breathlessness and unconsciousness in the last 6 days. Initial treatment with glucocorticoids for Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) proved ineffective in controlling the severe shortness of breath and hyperventilation, necessitating the use of ventilator-assisted ventilation. 18-Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (18FDG PET/CT) showed that the basal ganglia, brainstem, and multiple peripheral nerves were thickened and metabolically active. There were atypical cells in the cerebrospinal fluid; the pathology indicated invasive B-cell lymphoma, demonstrating a propensity toward diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). After receiving chemotherapy, the patient regained consciousness and was successfully weaned off ventilator assistance but died of severe pneumonia. Discussion: The early clinical manifestations of DLBCL lack specificity, and multifocal DLBCL complicates the diagnostic process. When a single primary disease cannot explain multiple symptoms, the possibility of DLBCL should be considered, and nervous system invasion should be considered when nervous system symptoms are present. Once nervous system involvement occurs in DLBCL, whether the central or peripheral nervous system, it indicates a poor prognosis.
