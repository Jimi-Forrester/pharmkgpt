32716358|t|Baseline Prevalence of Polypharmacy in Older Hypertensive Study Subjects with Elevated Dementia Risk: Findings from the Risk Reduction for Alzheimer's Disease Study (rrAD).
32716358|a|BACKGROUND: Little is known about the prevalence of polypharmacy, the taking of five or more medications a day, in older adults with specific dementia risk factors. OBJECTIVE: To examine the prevalence of polypharmacy in participants at baseline in a vascular risk reduction focused Alzheimer's disease (rrAD) trial targeting older patients with hypertension and elevated dementia risk. METHODS: We conducted a detailed review of medications in a cross-sectional study of community-dwelling older adults with hypertension and elevated dementia risk. Medications were identified in a structured interview process with an onsite pharmacist or qualified designee. Polypharmacy was defined as use of five or more medications on a regular basis. Descriptive analyses were conducted on the sample as well as direct comparisons of subgroups of individuals with hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia. RESULTS: The 514 rrAD participants, mean age 68.8 (standard deviation [sd] 6), reported taking different combinations of 472 unique medications at their baseline visit. The median number of medications taken by participants was eight [Range 0-21], with 79.2% exhibiting polypharmacy (n = 407). Sites differed in their prevalence of polypharmacy, chi2(3) = 56.0, p < 0.001. A nearly identical percentage of the 2,077 prescribed (51.8%) and over the counter (48.2%) medications were present in the overall medication profile. The presence of diabetes (87.5%), hyperlipidemia (88.2%), or both (97.7%) was associated with a higher prevalence of polypharmacy than participants who exhibited hypertension in the absence of either of these conditions (63.2%), chi2(3) = 35.8, p < 0.001. CONCLUSION: Participants in a dementia risk study had high levels of polypharmacy, with the co-existence of diabetes or hyperlipidemia associated with a greater prevalence of polypharmacy as compared to having hypertension alone.
