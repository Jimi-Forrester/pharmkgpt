33346907|a|Oligodendrocytes, the myelinating cells of the central nervous system, orchestrate several key cellular functions in the brain and spinal cord, including axon insulation, energy transfer to neurons, and, eventually, modulation of immune responses. There is growing interest for obtaining reliable markers that can specifically label oligodendroglia and their progeny. In many studies, anti-CC1 antibodies, presumably recognizing the protein adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), are used to label mature, myelinating oligodendrocytes. However, it has been discussed whether anti-CC1 antibodies could recognize as well, under pathological conditions, other cell populations, particularly astrocytes. In this study, we used transgenic mice in which astrocytes are labeled by the enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) under the control of the human glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) promoter. By detailed co-localization studies we were able to demonstrate that a significant proportion of eGFP-expressing cells co-express markers of the oligodendrocyte lineage, such as the transcription factor Oligodendrocyte Transcription Factor 2 (OLIG2); the NG2 proteoglycan, also known as chrondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4 (CSPG4); or APC. The current finding that the GFAP promoter drives transgene expression in cells of the oligodendrocyte lineage should be considered when interpreting results from co-localization studies.
