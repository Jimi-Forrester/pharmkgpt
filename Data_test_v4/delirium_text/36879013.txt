36879013|a|Heparan sulfates (HS) proteoglycans are commonly found on the cell surface and mediate many processes. Binding of HS ligands is determined by the sulfation code on the HS chain that can be N-/2-O/6-O- or 3-O-sulfated, generating heterogenous sulfation patterns. 3-O sulfated HS (3S-HS) play a role in several (patho)physiological processes such as blood coagulation, viral pathogenesis and binding and internalization of tau in Alzheimer's disease. However, few 3S-HS-specific interactors are known. Thus, our insight into the role of 3S-HS in health and disease is limited, especially in the central nervous system. Using human CSF, we determined the interactome of synthetic HS with defined sulfation patterns. Our affinity-enrichment mass spectrometry studies expand the repertoire of proteins that may interact with (3S-)HS. Validating our approach, ATIII, a known 3S-HS interactor, was found to require GlcA-GlcNS6S3S for binding, similar to what has been reported. Our dataset holds novel, potential HS and 3S-HS protein ligands, that can be explored in future studies focusing on molecular mechanisms that depend on 3S-HS in (patho)physiological conditions.
