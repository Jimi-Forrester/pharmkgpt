39590002|t|An Enzyme-Free Impedimetric Sensor Based on Flower-like NiO/Carbon Microspheres for L-Glutamic Acid Assay.
39590002|a|This research introduces a non-enzymatic electrochemical sensor utilizing flower-like nickel oxide/carbon (fl-NiO/C) microspheres for the precise detection of L-glutamic acid (LGA), a crucial neurotransmitter in the field of healthcare and a frequently utilized food additive and flavor enhancer. The fl-NiO/C were synthesized with controllable microstructures using metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as precursors followed by a simple calcination process. The uniformly synthesized fl-NiO/C microspheres were further characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM). The fl-NiO/C was utilized as a modifier on the surface of a glassy carbon electrode, and an impedimetric sensor based on electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was developed for the detection of LGA. The proposed sensor demonstrated excellent catalytic activity and selectivity towards LGA across a broad concentration range of 10-800 muM with a sensitivity of 486.9 microA.mM-1.cm-2 and a detection limit of 1.28 microM (S/N = 3). The sensor was also employed to identify LGA in blood plasma samples, yielding results that align with those obtained through HPLC. This achievement highlights the potential of fl-NiO/C microspheres in advancing cutting-edge biosensing applications.
