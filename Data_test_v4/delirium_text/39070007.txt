39070007|a|Introduction: Educational health promotion interventions for people with early-stage dementia have shown promising results, including empowering the person with dementia to live well and cope with their condition. Objectives: The aim of this study was to explore how group interactions, course structure, and facilitation by healthcare professionals in a 12-week educational health promotion course promote coping, healthy behaviors, and empowerment in people with early-stage dementia. Method: A focused ethnographic approach was employed, collecting data through moderate participant observations of people with early-stage dementia who attended the health promotion course and field conversations with the facilitators. Additionally, before and after the participants had completed the course, the participants and their care partners were interviewed individually. Results: The findings showed that group discussions provided an opportunity for the facilitators to identify knowledge gaps, correct misinterpretations of symptoms, and tailor the information to the participants' specific needs, thereby promoting healthy behaviors and empowering the participants. The consistent and structured format of the course appeared to reduce stress and promote learning. Learning about dementia first-hand, reminiscing, using humor, receiving support from others facing similar challenges, and receiving support and validation from facilitators all contributed to participants coping with their condition, processing negative emotions, and reducing internalized stigma. Conclusion: This study emphasized the importance of providing people living with early-stage dementia educational opportunities that combine first-hand information, peer and facilitator support, reminiscing, humor, recognition, and validation. These interventions can contribute to promote coping, healthy behaviors, and empowerment in people living with early-stage dementia.
