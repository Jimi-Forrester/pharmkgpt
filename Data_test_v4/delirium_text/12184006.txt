12184006|a|Palliative care has rapidly developed due to increasing of cancer disease and ageing of society as well. Philosophy of palliative care means: holistic care, good quality of life as it's main goal and acceptance of death. Good palliative care means also that the terminally ill elderly patients should be divided into two groups: 1. Persons with good psychic health state (but with some specific features of "senile personality"); 2. Patients with psychiatric disorders (dementia, delirium, aggressive behavior). The prompt recognition and treatment of both psychiatric and psychic healthy terminally ill patients becomes very important to the effective and good palliative care.
