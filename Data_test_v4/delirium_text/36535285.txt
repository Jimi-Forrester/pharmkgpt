36535285|a|BACKGROUND: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is characterized by increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure of unknown cause. It has been suggested that the inflammatory process plays a role in the pathophysiology of the disease. Sortilin-1, lipocalin-2, autotaxin, decorin, and interleukin-33 (IL-33) are among the factors involved in inflammatory processes. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the CSF levels of sortilin-1, lipocalin-2, autotaxin, decorin, and IL-33 in patients with IIH. METHODS: A total of 24 IIH patients and 21 healthy controls were included in the study. Demographic characteristics of the patients and of the control group as well as CSF pressures were evaluated. Sortilin-1, lipocalin-2, autotaxin, decorin and IL-33 levels in the CSF were measured. RESULTS: The CSF levels lipocalin-2, sortilin-1, autotaxin, IL-33 and CSF pressure were significantly higher in the patients group compared with the control group (p < 0.001). Decorin levels were reduced in patients (p < 0.05). There was no correlation between the autotaxin and IL-33 levels and age, gender, CSF pressure, and body mass index. The results of our study showed that inflammatory activation plays an important role in the development of the pathophysiology of IIH. In addition, the fact that the markers used in our study have never been studied in the etiopathogenesis of IIH is important in explaining the molecular mechanism of this disease. CONCLUSION: Studies are needed to evaluate the role of these cytokines in the pathophysiology of the disease. It is necessary to evaluate the effects of these molecules on this process.
