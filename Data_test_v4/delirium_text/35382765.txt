35382765|a|BACKGROUND: To report the main spectrum and new clinical and imaging characteristics of dipeptidyl-peptidase-like protein 6 (DPPX) antibody-associated encephalitis, and to evaluate the effect of immunotherapy. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of nine patients with anti-DPPX encephalitis was performed, and all previously reported cases in the literature were reviewed. A cell-based indirect immunofluorescence assay using human embryonic kidney 293 cells transfected with DPPX was used. RESULTS: Nine patients were identified (median age, 51 years; range, 14-65 years) with prodromal fever, diarrhea, or weight loss, followed by rapid progressive encephalopathy characterized by cognitive disorder. One patient who received methylprednisolone therapy and a trial of tacrolimus showed substantial improvement and had no relapse by the 6-month follow-up. Our comprehensive literature review demonstrated that 53 cases were reported, of which more than half had prodromal weight loss (52.8%) and gastrointestinal disorders (58.5%). Cognitive disorders (74.6%) and brainstem/spinal cord disorders (75.5%) were the most common major symptoms. A greater proportion of Chinese patients than non-Chinese patients had abnormalities on brain magnetic resonance imaging specific for encephalitis (70.0% vs. 23.3%, P < 0.001). Our study is the first to report three patients with anti-DPPX encephalitis who had sleep disorders with rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, limb paralysis (two), severe pleocytosis, elevated protein levels (two) in the cerebrospinal fluid, and increased T2/FLAIR signal abnormalities in the bilateral hippocampus, temporal lobe, amygdala, basal ganglia, thalamus, centrum semiovale, and frontal and parietal lobes in seven patients (77.8%). CONCLUSION: Our study expands the clinical and imaging phenotypes of anti-DPPX encephalitis. Further studies elucidating the entire clinical spectrum of anti-DPPX encephalitis, its pathogenic mechanisms, and prognosis under long-term immunosuppressive therapy are warranted.
