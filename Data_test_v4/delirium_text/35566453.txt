35566453|t|Glycated Albumin and Glycated Albumin/HbA1c Predict the Progression of Coronavirus Disease 2019 from Mild to Severe Disease in Korean Patients with Type 2 Diabetes.
35566453|a|Hyperglycemia is among the main risk factors for severe COVID-19. We evaluated the association of glycated albumin (GA) and GA/HbA1c ratio with progression of COVID-19 from mild to severe disease in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Our retrospective study included 129 patients aged over 18 years with COVID-19 and T2DM who did not have any need of oxygen supplement. Of these, 59 patients whose COVID-19 was aggravated and required oxygen supplementation eventually were classified as having severe disease. Clinical and laboratory data were compared between mild and severe cases. The median of GA (18.4% vs. 20.95%, p = 0.0013) and GA/HbA1c (2.55 vs. 2.68, p = 0.0145) were higher in severe disease than in mild disease and positively correlated with C-reactive protein (Kendal Tau coefficient 0.200 and 0.126, respectively; all p < 0.05). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that GA (odds ratio (OR), 1.151; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.024-1.294) and GA/HbA1c (OR, 8.330; 95% CI, 1.786-38.842) increased the risk of severe disease. Patients with GA 20% or higher were 4.03 times more likely to progress from mild to severe disease. GA and GA/HbA1c ratio predicted progression of COVID-19 from mild to severe disease in patients with T2DM.
