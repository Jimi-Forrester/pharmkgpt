39038355|a|Background: The common neurodegenerative disease among the elderly is Alzheimer's disease, which in severe cases can affect the quality of life of patients and their families. It has been reported that oral microorganisms are involved in the progression of Alzheimer's disease. Objective: To analyze the relationship between oral microorganisms and Alzheimer's disease. Methods: The oral microbial population, a comprehensive analysis of relevant literature was conducted. Immunofluorescence was adopted to assess albumin deposition in the cerebral cortex of mice. Western blot was used to detect expression level of CYP46 in mouse brain. Results: It can be concluded that the population of oral microorganisms includes bacteria, viruses, fungi, and spirochetes, which can cause various oral diseases. They can enter the human brain through the blood and surrounding nerves, leading to permeability increase of the blood-brain barrier and neuroimmune related inflammation. They will participate in and worsen the pathological process of Alzheimer's disease, leading to damage to neurons and cerebral blood vessels. The intervention methods for oral microbiota population include vaccination and phage therapy. Vaccines provide suitable treatment methods for periodontal disease, and phage therapy is a new method for controlling oral infections. At the same time, postoperative patients with oral diseases can use gel containing ethanol extract of Brazilian green propolis to ensure oral hygiene. In the rat blood-brain barrier model, porphyromonas gingivalis bacteremia enhanced barrier permeability, and immunofluorescence showed an increase in albumin deposition in the rat cerebral cortex. The expression of cytochrome P450 46A1 (CYP46A1) enzyme in the brain of Alzheimer's disease mice aged 24-56 weeks after long-term administration of SLAB51 increased. Conclusion: The elderly population should develop good living habits, maintain a clean mouth, and adjust the oral environment through methods such as oral and Alzheimer's disease promotion, combined with medication treatment.
