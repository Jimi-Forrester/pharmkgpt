31929814|t|Study of the Gastrointestinal Heat Retention Syndrome in Children: From Diagnostic Model to Biological Basis.
31929814|a|Gastrointestinal heat retention syndrome (GHRS) refers to a condition that is associated with increased gastrointestinal heat caused by a metabolic block in energy. It is common in children and is closely related to the occurrence and development of recurrent respiratory tract infection, pneumonia, recurrent functional abdominal pain, etc. However, there are no standardized diagnostic criteria to differentiate the GHRS. Therefore, this study is aimed to establish a diagnostic model for children's GHRS and explore the possible biological basis by using systems biology to achieve. Furthermore, Delphi method and the clinical data of Lasso analysis were used to screen out the core symptoms. Nineteen core symptoms of GHRS in children were screened including digestive symptoms such as dry stool, poor appetite, vomiting, and some nervous system symptoms such as night restlessness and irritability. Based on the core symptoms, a GHRS diagnosis model was established using the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) method, and the accuracy of internal verification reached 93.03%. Relevant targets of the core symptoms in the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) were retrieved, and target interactions were linked through the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins (STRING) database, and core targets were selected after topological analysis using Cytoscape. Relevant biological processes and pathways were analyzed by applying the DAVID and KEGG databases. The enriched biological processes focused on the cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and mitochondrial metabolism, which were mainly associated with PI3K-AKT, MAPK network pathways, and the Wnt signaling pathway. In conclusion, we established a diagnosis model of GHRS in children based on the core symptoms and provided an objective standard for its clinical diagnosis. And, the Wnt signaling pathway and the estrogen receptor-activated PI3K-AKT and MAPK network pathways may play important roles in the GHRS processing.
