37724506|a|BACKGROUND: Sarcopenia and frailty are both age-related declines in functional reserve that are linked to adverse health outcomes. It is critical to know about the outcomes of a combination of these conditions. The study aimed to investigate the effects of sarcopenia and frailty on postoperative recovery in elderly patients and to explore risk factors. METHODS: This prospective cohort study was conducted among 608 patients aged >=60 years, American Society of Anesthesiologists I-III, who were scheduled to undergo thoracic (non-cardiac) and abdominal surgery from 1 March 2022 to 31 October 2022 at the Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University. Frailty was measured by the 28-item frailty index, and sarcopenia was assessed sarcopenia was assessed by skeletal muscle index in computed tomographic scan, handgrip strength and 6-m walk. Participants were classified as follows: Group A: both sarcopenia and frailty; Group B: sarcopenia only; Group C: frailty only; and Group D: neither frailty nor sarcopenia. The primary outcome was 90-day morbidity. Multivariable logistic regression model was used to estimate the association between sarcopenia, frailty and 90-day morbidity. RESULTS: The median (interquartile range) age of participants was 68 (64-72) years, and 62.7% were men. The prevalence rates of sarcopenia and frailty were 32.8% and 47.6%, respectively. The 90-day morbidity in Group A was 58.5%, in Group B was 46.2%, in Group C was 42.0% and in Group D was 28.8%, and the difference was significant (P < 0.001). In the multivariable analysis, both sarcopenia and frailty [odds ratio (OR), 2.21; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.26-3.89], sarcopenia only (OR, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.01-3.36), frailty only (OR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.03-3.03), women (OR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.45-0.99), body mass index (OR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.88-0.99), pre-operative albumin (OR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.91-1.00) and operative stress score (OSS) [OSS 3 (OR, 2.09; 95% CI, 1.21-3.67); OSS 4-5 (OR, 3.81; 95% CI, 2.31-6.42)] were independently associated with 90-day morbidity. In the multivariable analysis with inverse probability weighting adjusted cohort, sarcopenia and frailty were also significantly associated with 90-day morbidity. CONCLUSIONS: Sarcopenia and frailty were associated with higher risks of postoperative 90-day morbidity in elderly patients alone and in combination. Sex, body mass index, pre-operative albumin and operative stress were also independent factors for postoperative morbidity within 90 days.
