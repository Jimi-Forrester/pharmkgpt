38312606|a|Background: It is widely acknowledged that botulinum toxin type A (BTX-A) has been widely used in the treatment of hemifacial spasm (HFS). However, there is currently a lack of systematic analysis of the factors affecting its therapeutic effect. Therefore, this study aims to explore the influencing factors of BTX-A in the treatment of HFS and to identify risk factors for poor prognosis. Methods: Retrospective study including 118 patients with HFS treated with BTX-A from 2019 January to 2023 April. Demographic and etiological variables as well as doses, number of sessions of BTX-A, infiltrated muscles, therapeutic response according to the Cohen evaluation scale, and side effects were analyzed. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the factors that are associated with the short-term prognosis of BTX-A for the treatment of HFS. Results: Among the 118 patients with HFS included in this study, 57 achieved complete relief, 51 had significant relief, 7 had partial relief, and no improvement was observed in 3. The overall effective rate was 91.53 %. Results from the univariate analysis indicated that male, drinking, diabetes, and hypertension were all associated with poor short-term prognosis of BTX-A in the treatment of HFS. Multivariable logistic regression analysis further revealed that hypertension was an independent risk factor for poor short-term prognosis following BTX-A treatment for HFS (OR=5.847, P<0.05). Conclusion: BTX-A was effective in treating HFS and had minimal adverse effects. Hypertension was an independent risk factor for poor short-term prognosis following BTX-A treatment of HFS.
