32470364|t|H3.3 Nucleosome Assembly Mutants Display a Late-Onset Maternal Effect.
32470364|a|Maternally inherited RNA and proteins control much of embryonic development. The effect of such maternal information beyond embryonic development is largely unclear. Here, we report that maternal contribution of histone H3.3 assembly complexes can prevent the expression of late-onset anatomical, physiologic, and behavioral abnormalities of C. elegans. We show that mutants lacking hira-1, an evolutionarily conserved H3.3-deposition factor, have severe pleiotropic defects that manifest predominantly at adulthood. These late-onset defects can be maternally rescued, and maternally derived HIRA-1 protein can be detected in hira-1(-/-) progeny. Mitochondrial stress likely contributes to the late-onset defects, given that hira-1 mutants display mitochondrial stress, and the induction of mitochondrial stress results in at least some of the hira-1 late-onset abnormalities. A screen for mutants that mimic the hira-1 mutant phenotype identified PQN-80-a HIRA complex component, known as UBN1 in humans-and XNP-1-a second H3.3 chaperone, known as ATRX in humans. pqn-80 and xnp-1 abnormalities are also maternally rescued. Furthermore, mutants lacking histone H3.3 have a late-onset defect similar to a defect of hira-1, pqn-80, and xnp-1 mutants. These data demonstrate that H3.3 assembly complexes provide non-DNA-based heritable information that can markedly influence adult phenotype. We speculate that similar maternal effects might explain the missing heritability of late-onset human diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and type 2 diabetes.
