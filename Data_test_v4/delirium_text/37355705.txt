37355705|t|Transcriptomic analysis reveals distinct adaptive molecular mechanism in the hippocampal CA3 from rats susceptible or not-susceptible to hyperthermia-induced seizures.
37355705|a|Febrile seizures during early childhood are a relevant risk factor for the development of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanism induced by febrile seizures that render the brain susceptible or not-susceptible to epileptogenesis remain poorly understood. Because the temporal investigation of such mechanisms in human patients is impossible, rat models of hyperthermia-induced febrile seizures have been used for that purpose. Here we conducted a temporal analysis of the transcriptomic and microRNA changes in the ventral CA3 of rats that develop (HS group) or not-develop (HNS group) seizures after hyperthermic insult on the eleventh postnatal day. The selected time intervals corresponded to acute, latent, and chronic phases of the disease. We found that the transcriptional differences between the HS and the HNS groups are related to inflammatory pathways, immune response, neurogenesis, and dendritogenesis in the latent and chronic phases. Additionally, the HNS group expressed a greater number of miRNAs (some abundantly expressed) as compared to the HS group. These results indicate that HNS rats were able to modulate their inflammatory response after insult, thus presenting better tissue repair and re-adaptation. Potential therapeutic targets, including genes, miRNAs and signaling pathways involved in epileptogenesis were identified.
