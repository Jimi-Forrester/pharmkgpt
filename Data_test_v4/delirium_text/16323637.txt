16323637|a|OBJECTIVES: Dementia has rapidly increased with the prolongation of life expectancy and aging in Korea. This study was conducted to estimate the prevalence of, and find related factors for, dementia in an urban elderly population, using a newly developed screening method. METHODS: Seven hundred and six people, aged over 65 years-old, in Dong district of Gwangju, Korea, were recruited using stratified cluster sampling, and completed Korean version of Geriatric Mental State Schedule B3 (GMS B3-K), the Korean version of the Community Screening Interview for Dementia (CSID-K) and modified 10 word list-learning from the Consortium to Establish a Registry of Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD). Dementia was diagnosed by an algorithm derived from all three of these measures. RESULTS: The crude and age adjusted prevalence rates of dementia were 13.0 and 11.5%, respectively. Age, education, marital status and a history of cerebrovascular disease were identified as factors related with dementia. CONCLUSIONS: The new instrument, using the GMS B3-K, CSID-K and modified 10 word list-learning from the CERAD, was considered effective as a community screening and diagnostic tool for dementia. The results of this study can also be used to develop a community-based prevention and management system for dementia in the future.
