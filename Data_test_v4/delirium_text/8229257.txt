8229257|a|To improve the diagnostic utility of brain single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in Alzheimer's disease (AD), we have developed and evaluated an objective method of differentiating patients and healthy elderly controls using a quantitative image analysis protocol. HMPAO-SPECT image datasets from 29 patients with probable AD and 78 age-matched controls were registered to a common anatomic frame of reference. Activity levels within 120 standardized cortical volumes were determined by an automated procedure. Subjects were classified into normal and AD groups by quadratic discriminant analysis using two features: global average activity level and average normalized activity levels within the two clusters of standardized volumes identified as most significantly different in AD by analysis of covariance. The classification used split-half replication to ensure valid results. Classification performance quantified by the area under a binormal ROC curve fitted to the data was 0.923 +/- 0.036; at a threshold likelihood ratio of 1, the sample sensitivity was 91% and specificity was 86%. We conclude that quantitative SPECT accurately distinguishes AD patients from elderly controls.
