38132490|t|Correlation between the Cognitive Status (SIRT1) and the Metabolic Function in Geriatric Patients Using the Indonesian Version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA-INA).
38132490|a|A growing life expectancy may result in a chronic medical condition and multimorbidity because the aging process leads to a decrease in cognitive and physiological function. These risks may affect the quality of life of geriatrics. The present study aims to determine the correlation between cognitive status (in terms of SIRT1, a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)-dependent class III deacetylase) and metabolic function (in terms of the lipid profile, kidney function, and blood glucose) in geriatric patients. The differences in the parameters of metabolic function in the participants' cognitive status were determined by using the Indonesian version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessments (MoCA-Ina). The elderly participants (n = 120) were recruited at three sites in Indonesia from March to October 2022. Our study demonstrated a negative correlation between the cognitive status of geriatric patients and their metabolic function, represented by the MoCA-Ina score with a linear regression equation of y = 0.27 - 2.4 x10-3x. Higher levels of LDL-C, cystatin C, and HbA1c were found in the Severe-Moderate Cognitive Impairment group. Determining the SIRT1 levels may be beneficial in predicting both the cognitive and metabolic status of geriatrics because this protein is among numerous metabolic sensors in the hypothalamus.
