37764783|a|Intestinal diseases caused by sleep deprivation (SD) are severe public health threats worldwide. However, whether or not probiotics attenuate the intestinal damage associated with SD remains unclear. In this study, we used antibiotic pretreatment and fecal microbiota transplantation to investigate the protective role of Lactiplantibacillus plantarum (L. plantarum) 124 against SD-related intestinal barrier damage in C57BL/6 mice. Compared with those of a normal sleeping mouse, we observed that intestinal antioxidant capacity and anti-inflammatory cytokine levels were decreased, while pro-inflammatory cytokines were increased in sleep deprivation mice with an increasing duration of sleep deprivation. This resulted in decreased tight junction protein expression and increased intestinal barrier permeability. In contrast, intragastric administration with L. plantarum 124 reversed SD-associated intestinal oxidative stress, inflammation, colonic barrier damage, and the dysbiosis of the microbiota in the colon. In addition, L. plantarum 124 restored gut microbiota homeostasis via restoring abundance, including that of Dubosiella, Faecalibaculum, Bacillus, Lachnoclostridium, and Bifidobacterium. Further studies showed that gut microbiota mediated SD-associated intestinal damage and the treatment L. plantarum 124 in SD-associated colonic barrier damage. L. plantarum 124 is a potential candidate for alleviating SD-associated intestinal barrier damage. Overall, L. plantarum 124 consumption attenuates intestinal oxidative stress, inflammation, and intestinal barrier damage in SD-associated mice via the modulation of gut microbes.
