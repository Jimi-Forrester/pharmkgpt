33924016|a|Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a very common and complex disease, as alcohol is the most widely used addictive drug in the world. This disorder has an enormous impact on public health and social and private life, and it generates a huge number of social costs. Alcohol use stimulates hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis responses and is the cause of many physical and social problems (especially liver disease and cancer), accidental injury, and risky sexual behavior. For years, researchers have been trying to identify the genetic basis of alcohol use disorder, the molecular mechanisms responsible for its development, and an effective form of therapy. Genetic and environmental factors are known to contribute to the development of AUD, and the expression of genes is a complicated process that depends on epigenetic modulations. Dietary nutrients, such as vitamins, may serve as one these modulators, as they have a direct impact on epigenomes. In this review, we connect gathered knowledge from three emerging fields-genetics, epigenetics, and nutrition-to form an amazing triangle relating to alcohol use disorder.
