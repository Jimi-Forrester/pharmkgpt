36213126|a|Manihot esculenta, commonly called cassava, is an economically valuable crop and important staple food, grown in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Demand for cassava in the food and fuel industry is growing worldwide. However, anthracnose disease caused by Colletotrichum gloeosporioides severely affects cassava yield and production. The bioactive molecules from Bacillus are widely used to control fungal diseases in several plants. Therefore, in this study, bioactive compounds (erucamide, behenic acid, palmitic acid, phenylacetic acid, and beta-sitosterol) from Bacillus megaterium were assessed against CDC42, a key protein for virulence, from C. gloeosporioides. Structure of the CDC42 protein was generated through the comparative homology modeling method. The binding site of the ligands and the stability of the complex were analyzed through docking and molecular dynamics simulation studies, respectively. Furthermore, a protein interaction network was envisaged through the STRING database, followed by enrichment analysis in the WebGestalt tool. From the enrichment analysis, it is apparent that bioactive from B. megaterium chiefly targets the MAP kinase pathway that is essential for filamentous growth and virulence. Further exploration through experimental studies could be advantageous for cassava improvement as well as to combat against C. gloeosporioides pathogen.
