15011425|a|The authors experienced 55 cases of anesthetic management in 52 elderly surgical patients, 14 men and 38 women, aged 90 to 101 years with an average of 92.1 +/- 2.1 years for the past ten years. Surgical procedures included 38 cases of orthopedic, 14 cases of general surgical and 3 cases of ophthalmic operations. Thirteen cases out of them were emergency. General, epidural, spinal, and local anesthesia were applied in 34 cases, 18 cases, 2 cases, and one case out of these elderly patients, respectively. These general anesthesia consisted of total intravenous anesthesia with propopol, fentanyl and ketamine in 27 cases, sevoflurane with nitrous oxide in 4 cases, isoflurane with nitrous oxide or air in 2 cases, and thiopental anesthesia in one case. The elderly patients had past history of heart disease, dementia, hypertension, cerebral infarction/hemorrhage, diabetes mellitus and others. Their preoperative examinations revealed anemia, hypoproteinemia, renal hypofunction, serum electrolytes imbalance, and others. Vasopessors were given to 42% of the patients during anesthesia and surgery. Their postoperative complications included myocardial infarction, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, hypotension following anemia, transient hemiparesis, delirium and so on. Two patients developed myocardial infarction postoperatively and died thereafter. The authors suggest that appropriate anesthetic management for elderly patients aged 90 years or older requires proper preoperative evaluation, sufficient vigilance of hemodynamics with direct arterial pressure measurement, reliable preparation of medical agents, and awareness of impairment of circulatory function and others by aging.
