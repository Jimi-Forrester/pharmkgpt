26283845|t|Case reports on atypical presentation of Plasmodium falciparum malaria in pediatric patients.
26283845|a|Variable atypical symptoms are commonly observed in malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum especially in endemic tropical nations such as India. Nystagmus is observed following involvement of the cerebellum especially during the postrecovery phase. While psychotic features such as severe agitation, hallucination, paranoia may be the early symptoms of falciparum malaria among pediatric patients, urticaria with or without fever can be the initial manifestation of the disease. As the morbidity and mortality of severe malaria are very high in India, these atypical presentations should be considered during diagnosis. We believe our report on atypical cases of falciparum malaria will sensitize doctors and health personnel about rare presentations in children and help in early diagnosis and management to reduce the severity and death toll due to the disease.
