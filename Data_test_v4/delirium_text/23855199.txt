23855199|a|Behavioral and psychological signs and symptoms of dementia (BPSD) can be interpreted as cognitively impaired patients' responses to external stimuli. The causes of BPSD include physical, psychological, and environmental factors, although combinations of these factors usually contribute to the development of BPSD. Representative conditions that should be distinguished from dementia include delirium, aphasia, and depression. It is important to differentiate depression from apathy associated with dementia. A well-balanced combination of drug therapy and non-pharmacological methods is required for the treatment of BPSD. Non-pharmacological methods should be considered first to address moderate BPSD in particular. It is advisable to carefully provide drug treatment following environmental control and non-drug treatment, and minimize adverse effects taking into consideration the physical characteristics of the elderly. Regarding methods for formulation according to the symptom, hyper- and hypoactivity symptoms should be addressed separately.
