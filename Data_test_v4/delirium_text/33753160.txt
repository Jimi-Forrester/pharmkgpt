33753160|a|Azadirachta indica or Neem has been extensively used in the Indian traditional medical system because of its broad range of medicinal properties. Neem contains many chemically diverse and structurally complex phytochemicals such as limonoids, flavonoids, phenols, catechins, gallic acid, polyphenols, nimbins. These phytochemicals possess vast array of therapeutic activities that include anti-feedant, anti-viral, anti-malarial, anti-bacterial, anti-cancer properties. In recent years, many phytochemicals from Neem have been shown to be beneficial against various neurological disorders like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, mood disorders, ischemic-reperfusion injury. The neuroprotective effects of the phytochemicals from Neem are primarily mediated by their anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic activities along with their ability to modulate signaling pathways. However, extensive studies are still required to fully understand the molecular mechanisms involved in neuropotective effects of phytochemicals from Neem. This review is an attempt to cover the neuroprotective properties of various phytochemicals from Neem along with their mechanism of action so that the potential of the compounds could be realized to reduce the burden of neurodegenerative diseases.
