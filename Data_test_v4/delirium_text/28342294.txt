28342294|t|Benzylphenylpyrrolizinones with Anti-amyloid and Radical Scavenging Effects, Potentially Useful in Alzheimer's Disease Treatment.
28342294|a|Herein we describe the drug design steps developed to increase the radical scavenging and beta-amyloid aggregation inhibitory activities of a previously described series of benzylidenephenylpyrrolizinones. Among the newly synthesized derivatives, some benzylphenylpyrrolizinones exhibited interesting results in regard to those activities. Initial druggability parameters were measured, and suggest these compounds as a suitable starting point for potential alternatives in treating Alzheimer's disease.
