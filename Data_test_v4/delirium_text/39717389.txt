39717389|a|Introduction and methods: Aiming to evaluate safety aspects of a recently proposed approach to target Alzheimer's disease, we mimicked a complex boron neutron capture therapy field using a mixed beam consisting of high- and low-linear energy transfer (LET) radiation, 241Am alpha particles (alpha) and/or X-ray radiation respectively, in human microglial (HMC3) cells. Results: Acute exposure to 2 Gy X-rays induced the strongest response in the formation of gammaH2AX foci 30 min post irradiation, while alpha- and mixed beam-induced damage (alpha:X-ray = 3:1) sustained longer. Fractionation of the same total dose (0.4 Gy daily) induced a similar number of gammaH2AX foci as after acute radiation, however, alpha- or mixed irradiation caused a higher expression of DNA damage response genes CDKN1A and MDM2 24 h after the last fraction, as well as a stronger decrease in cell viability and clonogenic survival compared to acute exposure. Phosphorylation of STING, followed by phosphorylation of NF-kappaB subunit p65, was rapidly induced (1 or 3 h, respectively) after the last fraction by all radiation qualities. This led to IL-1beta secretion into the medium, strongly elevated expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine genes and enhanced phagocytosis after fractionated exposure to alpha- and mixed beam-irradiation compared to their acute counterparts 24 h post-irradiation. Nevertheless, all inflammatory changes were returning to basal levels or below 10-14 days post irradiation. Discussion: In conclusion, we demonstrate strong transient pro-inflammatory induction by daily high-LET radiation in a microglia model, triggering phagocytosis which may aid in clearing amyloid beta, but importantly, from a safety perspective, without long-term alterations.
