37626576|t|Prediction of 3-Year Survival in Patients with Cognitive Impairment Based on Demographics, Neuropsychological Data, and Comorbidities: A Prospective Cohort Study.
37626576|a|OBJECTIVES: Based on readily available demographic data, neuropsychological assessment results, and comorbidity data, we aimed to develop and validate a 3-year survival prediction model for patients with cognitive impairment. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, 616 patients with cognitive impairment were included. Demographic information, data on comorbidities, and scores of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) scale, and Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire were collected. Survival status was determined via telephone interviews and further verified in the official death register in the third year. A 7:3 ratio was used to divide patients into the training and validation sets. Variables with statistical significance (p < 0.05) in the single-factor analysis were incorporated into the binary logistic regression model. A nomogram was constructed according to multivariate analysis and validated. RESULTS: The final cohort included 587 patients, of whom 525 (89.44%) survived and 62 (10.56%) died. Younger age, higher MMSE score, lower IADL score, absence of disinhibition, and Charlson comorbidity index score <= 1 were all associated with 3-year survival. These predictors yielded good discrimination with C-indices of 0.80 (0.73-0.87) and 0.85 (0.77-0.94) in the training and validation cohorts, respectively. According to the Hosmer-Lemeshow test results, neither cohort displayed any statistical significance, and calibration curves displayed a good match between predictions and results. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provided further insight into the factors contributing to the survival of patients with cognitive impairment. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Our model showed good accuracy and discrimination ability, and it can be used at community hospitals or primary care facilities that lack sophisticated equipment.
