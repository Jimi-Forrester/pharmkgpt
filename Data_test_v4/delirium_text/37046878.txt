37046878|t|IL-6 Enhances the Negative Impact of Cortisol on Cognition among Community-Dwelling Older People without Dementia.
37046878|a|There is growing evidence that high basal cortisol levels and systemic inflammation independently contribute to cognitive decline among older people without dementia. The present cross-sectional study examined (a) the potential synergistic effect of cortisol levels and systemic inflammation on executive function and (b) whether this effect is more prominent among older people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). A sub-sample of 99 patients with MCI and 84 older people without cognitive impairment (CNI) (aged 73.8 +- 7.0 years) were recruited from a large population-based cohort in Crete, Greece, and underwent comprehensive neuropsychiatric and neuropsychological evaluation and a single morning measurement of cortisol and IL-6 plasma levels. Using moderated regression models, we found that the relation between cortisol and executive function in the total sample was moderated by IL-6 levels (b = -0.994, p = 0.044) and diagnostic group separately (b = -0.632, p < 0.001). Moreover, the interaction between cortisol and IL-6 levels was significant only among persons with MCI (b = -0.562, p < 0.001). The synergistic effect of stress hormones and systemic inflammation on cognitive status appears to be stronger among older people who already display signs of cognitive decline. Targeting hypercortisolemia and inflammation may be a promising strategy toward improving the course of cognitive decline.
