39291997|a|SUMMARYSARS-CoV-2 can not only cause respiratory symptoms but also lead to neurological complications. Research has shown that more than 30% of SARS-CoV-2 patients present neurologic symptoms during COVID-19 (A. Pezzini and A. Padovani, Nat Rev Neurol 16:636-644, 2020, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41582-020-0398-3). Increasing evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 can invade both the central nervous system (CNS) (M.S. Xydakis, M.W. Albers, E.H. Holbrook, et al. Lancet Neurol 20: 753-761, 2021 https://doi.org/10.1016/S1474-4422(21)00182-4 ) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS) (M.N. Soares, M. Eggelbusch, E. Naddaf, et al. J Cachexia Sarcopenia Muscle 13:11-22, 2022, https://doi.org/10.1002/jcsm.12896), resulting in a variety of neurological disorders. This review summarized the CNS complications caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, including encephalopathy, neurodegenerative diseases, and delirium. Additionally, some PNS disorders such as skeletal muscle damage and inflammation, anosmia, smell or taste impairment, myasthenia gravis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, ICU-acquired weakness, and post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 were described. Furthermore, the mechanisms underlying SARS-CoV-2-induced neurological disorders were also discussed, including entering the brain through retrograde neuronal or hematogenous routes, disrupting the normal function of the CNS through cytokine storms, inducing cerebral ischemia or hypoxia, thus leading to neurological complications. Moreover, an overview of long-COVID-19 symptoms is provided, along with some recommendations for care and therapeutic approaches of COVID-19 patients experiencing neurological complications.
