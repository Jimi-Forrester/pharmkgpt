27023224|t|Association of DISC1 Polymorphisms with Late-Onset Alzheimer's Disease in Northern Han Chinese.
27023224|a|The disrupted-in-schizophrenia-1 (DISC1) is a candidate gene for psychiatric diseases and plays various roles in brain development. It has been reported as a candidate gene for Alzheimer's disease (AD) in a recent large genome-wide association study in Caucasians. To explore the associations between DISC1 and AD, we performed a case-control study including 2318 subjects in Northern Han Chinese. We found that one single nucleotide polymorphism (rs6675281) was associated with the risk of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) in northern Han Chinese population. As for rs821616 and rs3738401, no association was detected with LOAD. In conclusion, DISC1 increased the risk for LOAD in northern Han Chinese population.
