37273549|t|The Femoral Nerve Block Setting the Agenda for Nursing Care of Older Patients With hip Fractures-A Qualitative Study.
37273549|a|Introduction: Hip fractures among older people are common worldwide, and it is often associated with preoperative pain. Due to increased comorbidity and high age, traditional pain relief can be a challenge. An alternative to traditional pain relief is a femoral nerve block, which is safe and suitable for anesthesia and analgesia for hip fractures among patients with or without dementia. It is essential to provide adequate pain management, and nurses report negative attitudes toward opioids and seem to prefer alternative pain management. To our knowledge, no study has focused on staff's experiences of nursing care for patients treated with femoral nerve block. Aim: To describe staff's experiences providing nursing care in preoperative pain and pain management to older patients with a hip fracture who received a femoral nerve block. Design: A qualitative exploratory design. Method: Semistructured interviews with 19 nurses or assistant nurses in an orthopedic ward or emergency department. They were experienced in caring for patients with hip fractures who received treatment with a femoral nerve block. The interviews were subjected to qualitative content analysis. Results: Staff described the femoral nerve block as setting the agenda when caring for older patients with hip fractures in the preoperative phase. The outcome of the femoral nerve block affected nursing care, depending on if the femoral nerve block was successful or not. Nursing care requires timing, with a need for staff orienting to time and customizing their communication. Further, staff faced ethical challenges regarding doing good and not harm, relieving pain, and avoiding side effects. Conclusions: The femoral nerve block was an important issue for nursing staff in patients with hip fractures in the preoperative phase. Our results point toward the benefits of giving femoral nerve blocks as soon as possible to facilitate nursing care, however, this should be studied in future research.
