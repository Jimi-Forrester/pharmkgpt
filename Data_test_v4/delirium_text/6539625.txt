6539625|t|Effects of single and repeated alcohol withdrawal on kindling.
6539625|a|It has been hypothesized that an electrophysiological reorganization of the limbic system takes place with repeated episodes of alcohol withdrawal which leaves the individual more susceptible to withdrawal effects, including delirium tremens and seizures. We examined the effects of two alcohol-dosing paradigms on the rate of kindling. Levels of ethanol below 300 mg/dl clearly did not accelerate the rate of kindling nor appear to affect the afterdischarge threshold, in spite of the fact that these levels have produced short-term withdrawal symptoms in other studies. Higher levels appeared to accelerate kindling. In the second experiment kindling was accelerated in animals with blood alcohol levels between 300 and 500 mg/dl. These findings are discussed in relation to clinical studies of alcohol withdrawal.
