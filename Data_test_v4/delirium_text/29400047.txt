29400047|a|Exchanges, travel, intercountry adoption which has become an increasingly common practice, uprooting, etc. have disrupted the compositions of increasingly multilingual societies and families. The development of research in cognitive sciences and the birth of bilingualism as a field of study since the 1970s, together with recent advances in linguistics, psychology, neuroimaging and speech therapy have made it possible to better describe the neuropsychological function and development of the bilingual person, particularly in the development of the normo and hearing-impaired child, in both language and behavior. It also involves other pathological situations such as stuttering and autism seen in Alzheimer's disease. Bilingualism is now a recognized cultural, social, educational and professional substantial asset. Children who are able to express themselves in more than one language see their metalinguistic skills increase and show a stronger attachment to their parent's culture of origin.
