38646224|t|A Rare Case of Congenital Left Ventricular Diverticulum With Apical Thrombus: Diagnostic Challenges and Management Insights.
38646224|a|A myocardial diverticulum is a rare congenital anomaly characterized by pouch-like protrusions within the myocardial wall, which can potentially lead to various cardiac complications. This case report describes a unique presentation of a left ventricular diverticulum (LVD) with an associated apical thrombus, highlighting the diagnostic and management challenges posed by this condition. A 58-year-old man presented to the emergency department with left arm weakness, wrist drop, and chest pain, initially raising concerns for a stroke. Diagnostic evaluations, including echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), revealed a small focal outpouching at the left ventricular apex, consistent with a congenital LVD containing a thrombus. This diagnosis was supported by the patient's historical imaging dating back to 2007, which had similarly identified this outpouching. The patient was managed with anticoagulation therapy, transitioning from heparin to warfarin, alongside standard cardiac care. This case underscores the importance of considering myocardial diverticulum in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with cardiac symptoms that might initially suggest more common conditions, such as stroke. It also highlights the essential role of echocardiography and MRI in diagnosing and managing myocardial diverticula.
