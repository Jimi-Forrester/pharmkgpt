38518455|a|OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness of a nursing intervention based on the Dynamic Symptom Model (DSM) and scientific evidence versus daily care in reducing the incidence and duration of delirium in intensive care patients. METHOD: We designed the intervention named "DyDel" (By Dynamic Delirium) based on the theoretical approach of the DSM and from scientific evidence. A double-masked clinical trial of parallel groups was developed to test DyDel, with 213 patients older than 18 admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) randomized to the study groups. The intervention group received DyDel each shift from day 0 until discharged from the ICU, while the control group received daily care in the ICU. At the same time, all participants were followed to measure primary (incidence and duration of delirium) and secondary outcomes (level of sedation and pain, days of mechanical ventilation, stay in ICU, and physical restriction). RESULTS: Overall, the study population were older than 60 years (60.3 +- 15.2 years), the male gender (59.6 %), and the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (73.7 %) were predominant. Comparing groups of study, the incidence of delirium was lower in the intervention group (5.6 %) than in the control group (14.8 %) (p = 0.037). The intervention group had lower days with delirium (0.07 +- 0.308) than the control group (0.34 +- 1.28) (p = 0.016), lower pain intensity (p = 0.002) and lower days of physical restraints (p = 0.06). CONCLUSION: Non-pharmacological care, like the DyDel intervention, includes the family and focuses on the different patient's needs, which can help to reduce the incidence and duration of delirium in patients admitted to adult ICUs. IMPLICATIONS FOR CLINICAL PRACTICE: DyDel was non-pharmacological and included the family. The DyDel's activities were focused on physiological, psychological, spiritual, and social needs and the experience and trajectory of delirium. The nurse can give humanized care in the ICU by applying DyDel.
