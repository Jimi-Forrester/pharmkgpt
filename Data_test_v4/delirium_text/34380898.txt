34380898|a|Morphometric changes in cortical thickness (CT), cortical surface area (CSA), and cortical volume (CV) can reflect pathological changes after acute mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). Most previous studies focused on changes in CT, CSA, and CV in subacute or chronic mTBI, and few studies have examined changes in CT, CSA, and CV in acute mTBI. Furthermore, acute mTBI patients typically show transient cognitive impairment, and few studies have reported on the relationship between cerebral morphological changes and cognitive function in patients with mTBI. This prospective cohort study included 30 patients with acute mTBI (15 males, 15 females, mean age 33.7 years) and 27 matched healthy controls (12 males, 15 females, mean age 37.7 years) who were recruited from the Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University between September and December 2019. High-resolution T1-weighted images were acquired within 7 days after the onset of mTBI. The results of analyses using FreeSurfer software revealed significantly increased CSA and CV in the right lateral occipital gyrus of acute-stage mTBI patients compared with healthy controls, but no significant changes in CT. The acute-stage mTBI patients also showed reduced executive function and processing speed indicated by a lower score in the Digital Symbol Substitution Test, and reduced cognitive ability indicated by a longer time to complete the Trail Making Test-B. Both increased CSA and CV in the right lateral occipital gyrus were negatively correlated with performance in the Trail Making Test part A. These findings suggest that cognitive deficits and cortical alterations in CSA and CV can be detected in the acute stage of mTBI, and that increased CSA and CV in the right lateral occipital gyrus may be a compensatory mechanism for cognitive dysfunction in acute-stage mTBI patients. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, China (approval No. 086) on February 9, 2019.
