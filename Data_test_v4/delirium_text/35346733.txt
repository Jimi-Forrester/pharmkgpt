35346733|t|Longitudinal assessment of aggression and circadian rhythms in the APPswe mouse model of Alzheimer`s disease.
35346733|a|Agitation, which comprises verbal or physical aggression and hyperactivity, is one of the most frequent neuropsychiatric symptoms observed in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). It often co-occurs with dysregulated circadian rhythms. Current medications are associated with serious adverse effects, and novel therapeutics are therefore needed. Rodent models can be instrumental to provide a first signal for potential efficacy of novel drug candidates. Longitudinal data assessing the face validity of such models for AD-related agitation are largely missing. We employed telemeterized APPswe mice, a frequently used AD transgenic mouse line overexpressing the human beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) with the Swedish KM670/671NL mutation, to study the occurrence and progression of changes in reactive aggressive behavior as well as the circadian profile of locomotor activity and body temperature. Analysis was conducted between 5 and 11 months of age, at regular 2-months intervals. The aggressivity of all mice was highest at 5 months and waned with increasing age. APPswe mice were more aggressive than WT at 5 and 7 months of age. The locomotor activity and body temperature of WT mice declined with increasing age, while that of APPswe mice remained rather constant. This genotype difference was solely evident during the active, dark phase. APPswe mice did not display a phase shift of their circadian rhythms. We conclude that the APPswe mouse line can recapitulate some of the behavioral disturbances observed in AD, including an agitation-relevant phenotype characterized by active phase hyperactivity and aggressivity. It does not recapitulate the nighttime disturbances (also characterized by hyperactivity) and the shift of circadian rhythms observed in AD patients. Therefore, the APPswe strain could be used at specific ages to model a subset of agitation-relevant behavioral problems and to test the modulatory effects of drugs.
