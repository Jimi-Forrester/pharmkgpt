17608890|t|Tracking clerkship experience: just what do clinical clerks see on an Elder Care rotation?
17608890|a|The Schulich School of Medicine, University of Western Ontario, Canada, has created a mandatory clerkship in Elder Care that consists of small group seminars, clinical experiences, and an Elder Care manual. This article describes the use of a paper-based log to track students' clinical encounters to determine whether the Elder Care clerkship offers students the opportunity for a broad range of clinical experiences to address curriculum objectives. Using a paper-based log that was completed after each clinical encounter, students recorded information including the reason for assessment, tests completed, care recommendations, and personal reflections. Each of 70 students completed an average of 5.5 logs. Cognitive/psychiatric, medical, functional, and social problems were reported in more than 83% of the logs. Almost all students saw at least one patient with cognitive decline and one with depressive symptoms. Only six students reported seeing a patient with delirium. Students were able to think reflectively on their experiences. In matching the clerkship objectives to the learning modality(ies) in which they were addressed, it was found that knowledge-related objectives were supported primarily by seminars and manual content. Skills-related objectives were supported primarily by clinical experiences. The clinical experience logs used in this study provided evidence that, in the Elder Care clerkship, for the most part, students are seeing what we think they should be seeing. Study results have informed the revision of the logs, which will be an ongoing method of tracking objectives and students' reflections and ensuring continuous quality improvement.
