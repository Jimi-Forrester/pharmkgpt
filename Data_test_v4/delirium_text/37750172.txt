37750172|t|Prophylactic Treatment of Intestinal Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury Reduces Mucosal Damage and Improves Intestinal Absorption.
37750172|a|Purpose: Intestinal ischemia-reperfusion injury (i-IRI) involves a blood flow interruption in an intestinal segment followed by blood flow restoration. When blood flow is restored, oxidative and inflammatory molecules are distributed throughout the bloodstream, triggering both local and systemic damage. Our goal was to evaluate the potential of three antioxidant and/or anti-inflammatory compounds (curcumin, dexmedetomidine and alpha-tocopherol) to prevent or reverse local and systemic damage induced by i-IRI. Methods: i-IRI was induced by placing a microvascular clip in the superior mesenteric artery of female WAG/RijHsd rats; the clip was removed after 1h and reperfusion was allowed for 4h. Curcumin (200 mg/kg, orally), alpha-tocopherol (20 mg/kg, i.p.), and dexmedetomidine (5 or 20 microg/kg, s.c.; DEX5 and DEX20, respectively) were administered. Blood and terminal ileum specimens were collected for biochemical and histological determination. Furthermore, D-xylose absorption test was performed to evaluate intestinal absorption; after completing the 1-hour ischemia and 4-hour reperfusion period, 1 mL of aqueous D-xylose solution (0.615 mg/mL) was administered orally, and one hour later, plasma D-xylose levels were quantified. Results: The histological injury degree (HID) measured by the Chiu scale was significantly reduced when the treatments were applied (non-treated rats, 2.6 +- 0.75; curcumin, 1.54 +- 0.8; DEX5, 1.47 +- 0.7; DEX20 1.14 +- 0.5; and alpha-tocopherol, 1.01 +- 0.6); intestinal absorptive capacity also improved in all cases healthy rats (2.06 +- 0.07 microg/mL; non-treated, 1.18 +- 0.07 microg/mL; curcumin 1.76 +- 0.3 microg/mL; DEX5, 2.29 +- 0.2 microg/mL; DEX20, 2.25 +- 0.26 microg/mL; and alpha-tocopherol 1.66 +- 0.21 microg/mL). However, it failed to reduce liver enzyme levels. Finally, only dexmedetomidine significantly reduced urea and creatinine levels compared to non-treated animals. Conclusion: All drugs were effective in reducing HID, although alpha-tocopherol was effective to a greater extent. Only dexmedetomidine reverted intestinal absorption to normal values of healthy animals.
