10077672|a|Genetic analyses in Caenorhabditis elegans demonstrate that sel-12 and hop-1, homologues of the Alzheimer's disease-associated presenilin genes, modify signaling through LIN-12 and GLP-1, homologues of the Notch cell surface receptor. To gain insight into the biochemical basis of this genetic interaction, we tested the possibility that presenilin-1 (PS1) physically associates with the Notch1 receptor in mammalian cells. Notch1 and PS1 coimmunoprecipitated from transiently transfected human embryonic kidney 293 cell lysates in a detergent-sensitive manner, consistent with a noncovalent physical association between the two proteins. The interaction predominantly occurred early in the secretory pathway prior to Notch cleavage in the Golgi, because PS1 immunoprecipitation preferentially recovered the full-length Notch1 precursor. When PS1 was immunoprecipitated from 293 cells that had been metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine, Notch1 was the primary protein detected in PS1 immunoprecipitates, suggesting that this interaction is specific. Furthermore, endogenous Notch and presenilin coimmunoprecipitated from cultured Drosophila cells, indicating that physical interaction can occur at physiological expression levels. These results suggest that the genetic relationship between presenilins and the Notch signaling pathway derives from a direct physical association between these proteins in the secretory pathway.
