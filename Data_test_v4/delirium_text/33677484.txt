33677484|a|AIMS: Valid measures to identify harmful alcohol use are important. Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) is a validated questionnaire used to self-report harmful drinking in several cultures and settings. Phosphatidylethanol 16:0/18:1 (PEth) is a direct alcohol biomarker measuring alcohol consumption levels. The aim of this study was to investigate how PEth levels correlate with AUDIT-QF and weekly grams of alcohol consumed among patients in two urban hospitals. In addition, we wanted to investigate the predictive value of PEth in identifying harmful alcohol use as defined by AUDIT-QF and weekly grams of alcohol cutoffs. METHODS: A cross-sectional study comprising acute medically ill patients with measurable PEth levels (>=0.030 muM) admitted to two urban hospitals in Oslo, Norway (N = 931) and Moscow, Russia (N = 953) was conducted using PEth concentrations in whole blood, sociodemographic data and AUDIT-QF questionnaires. RESULTS: PEth levels from patients with measurable PEth were found to be positively correlated with AUDIT-QF scores, with PEth cutpoints of 0.128 muM (Oslo) and 0.270 muM (Moscow) providing optimal discrimination for harmful alcohol use defined by AUDIT-QF (the difference between cities probably reflecting different national drinking patterns in QF). When converting AUDIT-QF into weekly grams of alcohol consumed, the predictive value of PEth improved, with optimal PEth cutpoints of 0.327 (Oslo) and 0.396 (Moscow) muM discriminating between harmful and non-harmful alcohol use as defined in grams (>=350 grams/week). CONCLUSIONS: By using PEth levels and converting AUDIT-QF into weekly grams of alcohol it was possible to get an improved rapid and sensitive determination of harmful alcohol use among hospitalized patients.
