32915774|t|Physical performance and chronic kidney disease development in elderly adults: results from a nationwide cohort study.
32915774|a|Sarcopenia, which is characterized by muscle mass and physical performance, is closely associated with morbidities and mortality, especially among the elderly. However, the effect of physical performance on chronic kidney disease (CKD) development is not yet fully elucidated. A total of 30,871 adults aged 66 years with preserved renal function who underwent health screening examinations were evaluated. Physical performance was assessed using a 3-m timed up and go (TUG) test and the one-leg stand (OLS) test. The primary outcome was the development of CKD, defined as at least two consecutive measurements of estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2. The rates of mortality and incident CKD development were significantly elevated with increases in TUG test scores but not in OLS scores. In the Cox hazards model, the highest TUG test score tertile was associated with an increased risk for CKD development (hazard ratio, 1.23; 95% confidence interval, 1.10-1.38) compared with the lowest tertile. No significant relationship was observed between OLS score and incident CKD risk. Poor physical performance, assessed using the TUG test, was related to an increased risk of CKD development.
