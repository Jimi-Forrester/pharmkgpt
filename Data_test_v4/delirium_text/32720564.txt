32720564|a|Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) acts as a promising protein targets for which drug as an inhibitor can be designed to treat Alzheimer's Disease. Different flavonoids and alkaloids of Bauhinia variegata were used as an inhibitor to target the protein. The current in silico study was carried out to explore the binding patterns of flavanoids and alkaloids against Acetylcholinesterase (PDB ID: 4PQE) and Butyrylcholinesterase (PDB ID: 1P0I) using molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations approach. Molecular docking result shows that Dihydroquercetin (CID:439533) binds with the active region of AChE and BChE. Using molsoft, molinspiration, and pkCSM all the properties of the candidate were analyzed. The best compound Dihydroquercetin was compared with Donepezil drug through molecular dynamic simulation studies. The analysis of Molecular Dynamics Simulations showed that AChE and AChE-Dihydroquercetin complex became stable at 3000 ps and there was little conformational change in BChE and BChE-Dihydroquercetin complex. The in silico study finally predicts that Dihydroquercetin may act as a good inhibitor for treating Alzheimer's disease and further in vitro and in vivo studies may prove its therapeutic potential.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.
