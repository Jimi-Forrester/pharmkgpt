According to cerebral small vascular disease (CSVD) score, the patients were divided into CSVD 0~4 groups. The patients who completed the three-month follow-up were classified into cognitive impairment group (124 cases) and the noncognitive impairment group (84 cases) according to the cut-off point of the Montreal cognitive assessment (MOCA) scale score of 26. A novel image segmentation algorithm was proposed based on U-shaped fully CNN (U-Net) and conditional random field, which was compared with the fully CNN (FCN) algorithm and U-Net algorithm, and was applied to the MRI segmentation training of patients with severe stroke. It was found that the average symmetric surface distance (ASSD) (3.13 +- 1.35), Hoffman distance (HD) (28.71 +- 9.05), Dice coefficient (0.78 +- 1.35), accuracy (0.74 +- 0.11), and sensitivity (0.85 +- 0.13) of the proposed algorithm were superior to those of FCN algorithm and U-Net algorithm. There were significant differences in the MOCA scores among the five groups of patients from CSVD 0 to CSVD 4 in the three time periods (0, 1, and 3 months) (P < 0.05). Differences in cerebral microhemorrhage (CMB), perivascular space (PVS), and number of cavities, Fazekas, and total CSVD scores between the two groups were significant (P < 0.05). Multivariate regression found that the number of PVS, white matter hyperintensity (WMH) Fazekas, and total CSVD score were independent factors of cognitive impairment. In short, MRI images based on deep learning image segmentation algorithm had good application value for clinical diagnosis and treatment of stroke and can effectively improve the detection effect of brain domain characteristics and psychological state of patients after stroke.
