38977621|t|DNA Damage and Chromatin Rearrangement Work Together to Promote Neurodegeneration.
38977621|a|Neurodegenerative diseases have a complex origin and are composed of genetic and environmental factors. Both DNA damage and chromatin rearrangement are important processes that occur under pathological conditions and in neurons functioning properly. While numerous studies have demonstrated the inseparable relationship between DNA damage and chromatin organization, understanding of this relationship, especially in neurodegenerative diseases, requires further study. Interestingly, recent studies revealed that known hallmark proteins involved in neurodegenerative diseases function in both DNA damage and chromatin reorganization, and this review discusses the current knowledge of this relationship. This review focused on hallmark proteins involved in various neurodegenerative diseases, such as the microtubule-associated protein tau, TAR DNA/RNA binding protein 43 (TDP-43), superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), fused in sarcoma (FUS), huntingtin (HTT), alpha-synuclein, and beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP). Hence, DNA damage and chromatin rearrangement are associated with disease mechanisms in distinct neurodegenerative diseases. Targeting common modulators of DNA repair and chromatin reorganization may lead to promising therapies for treating neurodegeneration.
