33841843|a|Ficus species have been used as a typical component in food and folk medicine in Asia for centuries. However, little is known regarding the bioactivity and genotoxicity of the recently identified Ficus dubia (FD), an indigenous plant of the tropical evergreen rain forest. FD is unique from other Ficus species because of its highly sought-after red-brown latex. Antioxidant properties together with phenolic and flavonoid contents of FD were elucidated. Health-promoting characteristics were examined by studying the inhibition of enzymes as a drug target for diabetes, hypertension, Alzheimer's disease, and obesity, together with anticancer ability against human colorectal adenocarcinoma, human hepatocellular carcinoma, human ovarian carcinoma, human prostate adenocarcinoma, and human lung carcinoma. Besides, FD genotoxicity was tested using the Drosophila wing spot test. Results showed that both FD root and latex exhibited antioxidant activity due to the presence of phenolics and flavonoids, specifically caffeic acid and cyanidin. The ethanolic fraction of FD root demonstrated a potent antidiabetic mechanism underlying alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity similar to acarbose. This fraction also suppressed lung and ovarian cancer growth, possibly by G1 and G2/M arrest, respectively. All tested fractions lacked mutagenicity in vivo. Results indicated that FD can be developed as novel antidiabetic compounds; however, its bioactive compounds should be further identified.
