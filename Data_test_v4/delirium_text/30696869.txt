30696869|a|Diabetes mellitus is associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer's dementia and cognitive decline. The cause of neurodegeneration in chronic diabetic patients remains unclear. Changes in brain microglial activity due to glycemic fluctuations may be an etiological factor. Here, we examined the impact of acute ambient glucose fluctuations on BV-2 microglial activity. Biochemical parameters were assayed and showed that the shift from normal glucose (NG; 5.5 mM) to high glucose (HG; 25 mM) promoted cell growth and induced oxidative/inflammatory stress and microglial activation, as evidenced by increased MTT reduction, elevated pro-inflammatory factor secretion (i.e., TNF-alpha and oxygen free radicals), and upregulated expression of stress/inflammatory proteins (i.e., HSP70, HO-1, iNOS, and COX-2). Also, LPS-induced inflammation was enlarged by an NG-to-HG shift. In contrast, the HG-to-NG shift trapped microglia in a state of metabolic stress, which led to apoptosis and autophagy, as evidenced by decreased Bcl-2 and increased cleaved caspase-3, TUNEL staining, and LC3B-II expression. These stress episodes were primarily mediated through MAPKs, PI3K/Akt, and NF-kappaB cascades. Our study demonstrates that acute glucose fluctuation forms the stress that alters microglial activity (e.g., inflammatory activation or self-degradation), representing a novel pathogenic mechanism for the continued deterioration of neurological function in diabetic patients.
