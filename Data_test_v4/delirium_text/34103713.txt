34103713|t|Exercise mimetics: harnessing the therapeutic effects of physical activity.
34103713|a|Exercise mimetics are a proposed class of therapeutics that specifically mimic or enhance the therapeutic effects of exercise. Increased physical activity has demonstrated positive effects in preventing and ameliorating a wide range of diseases, including brain disorders such as Alzheimer disease and dementia, cancer, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. This article discusses the molecular mechanisms and signalling pathways associated with the beneficial effects of physical activity, focusing on effects on brain function and cognitive enhancement. Emerging therapeutic targets and strategies for the development of exercise mimetics, particularly in the field of central nervous system disorders, as well as the associated opportunities and challenges, are discussed.
