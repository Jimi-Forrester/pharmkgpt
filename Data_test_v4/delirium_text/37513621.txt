37513621|t|Mapping Research Trends and Hotspots in the Link between Alzheimer's Disease and Gut Microbes over the Past Decade: A Bibliometric Analysis.
37513621|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a globally prevalent neurodegenerative disorder, the underlying causes and mechanisms of which remain elusive. The emerging interest in the potential connection between gut microbes and AD prompted our study to investigate this field through bibliometric analysis. To examine research trends over the past decade, we collected relevant data using search terms associated with gut microbiota and AD from the Web of Science Core Collection. Our analysis involved various tools, including R (version 4.2.2), VOSviewer (version 1.6.18), CiteSpace software (version 6.2.R1), and an online bibliometric platform. Our findings identified a total of 1170 articles published between 2012 and 2022, indicating a consistent growth of research interest in this area. Notably, China significantly contributed with 40.7% (374) of the publications, signifying its prominent role in this field. Among the journals, the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease published the highest number of articles (57; 4.9%). In terms of author influence, Wang Y, with an H-index of 13, emerged as the most influential author. Additionally, Shanghai Jiaotong University was the most productive institution, accounting for 66 articles (5.6%). Through keyword analysis, we grouped high-frequency keywords into six clusters: gut microbiota, AD, neuroinflammation, gut-brain axis, oxidative stress, and chain fatty acids. Chain fatty acids, oxidative stress, and the gut-brain axis emerged as dominant research topics in the past five years. Recent studies have specifically focused on "nlrp3 inflammasome" and "clearance" (2020-2022), indicating shifting research interests within this field. This bibliometric analysis aims to provide insights into the evolving landscape of research on the gut microbiota and AD. Our results identify key research trends and themes while highlighting potential research gaps. The findings offer valuable perspectives for future investigations, advancing our understanding of AD and exploring potential therapeutic strategies.
