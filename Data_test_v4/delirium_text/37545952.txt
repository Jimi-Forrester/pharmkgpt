37545952|a|There are many uncertainties on the future management of the coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) in Africa. By July 2021, Africa had lagged behind the rest of the world in Covid-19 vaccines uptake, accounting for just 1.6% of doses administered globally. During that time COVID 19 was causing an average death rate of 2.6% in Africa, surpassing the then global average of 2.2%. There were no clear therapeutic guidelines, yet inappropriate and unnecessary treatments may have led to unwanted adverse events such as worsening of hyperglycemia and precipitating of ketoacidosis in administration of steroid therapy. in order to provide evidence-based policy guidelines, we examined peer-reviewed published articles in PubMed on COVID 19, or up-to date data, we focused our search on publications from 1st May 2020 to 15th July, 2021. For each of the studies, we extracted data on pathophysiology, selected clinical chemistry and immunological tests, clinical staging and treatment. Our review reports a gross unmet need for vaccination, inadequate laboratory capacity for immunological tests and the assessment of individual immune status, clinical staging and prediction of disease severity. We recommend selected laboratory tools in the assessment of individual immune status, prediction of disease severity and determination of the exact timing for suitable therapy, especially in individuals with co-morbidities.
