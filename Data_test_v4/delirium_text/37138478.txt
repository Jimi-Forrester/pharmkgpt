37138478|a|Nanotechnology is a great choice for medical research, and the green synthesis approach is a novel and better way to synthesize nanoparticles. Biological sources are cost-effective, environmentally friendly, and allow large-scale production of nanoparticles. Naturally obtained 3 beta-hydroxy-urs-12-en-28-oic acids reported for neuroprotective and dendritic structure are reported as solubility enhancers. Plants are free from toxic substances and act as natural capping agents. In this review, the pharmacological properties of ursolic acid (UA) and the structural properties of the dendritic structure are discussed. UA acid appears to have negligible toxicity and immunogenicity, as well as favorable biodistribution, according to the current study, and the dendritic structure improves drug solubility, prevents drug degradation, increases circulation time, and potentially targets by using different pathways with different routes of administration. Nanotechnology is a field in which materials are synthesized at the nanoscale. Nanotechnology could be the next frontier of humankind's technological advancement. Richard Feynman first used the term 'Nanotechnology' in his lecture, "There is Plenty of Room at the Bottom," on 29th December, 1959, and since then, interest has increased in the research on nanoparticles. Nanotechnology is capable of helping humanity by solving major challenges, particularly in neurological disorders like Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most prevalent type, which may account for 60-70% of cases. Other significant forms of dementia include vascular dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies (abnormal protein aggregates that form inside nerve cells), and a number of illnesses that exacerbate frontotemporal dementia. Dementia is an acquired loss of cognition in several cognitive domains that are severe enough to interfere with social or professional functioning. However, dementia frequently co-occurs with other neuropathologies, typically AD with cerebrovascular dysfunction. Clinical presentations show that neurodegenerative diseases are often incurable because patients permanently lose some neurons. A growing body of research suggests that they also advance our knowledge of the processes that are probably crucial for maintaining the health and functionality of the brain. Serious neurological impairment and neuronal death are the main features of neurodegenerative illnesses, which are also extremely crippling ailments. The most prevalent neurodegenerative disorders cause cognitive impairment and dementia, and as average life expectancy rises globally, their effects become more noticeable.
