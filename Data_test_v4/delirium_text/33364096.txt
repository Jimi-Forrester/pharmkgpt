33364096|t|Methylene Blue Spray for Identification of Parathyroid Glands During Thyroidectomy.
33364096|a|BACKGROUND: Hypocalcaemia is a common delayed complication after thyroidectomy. Several studies have identified risk factors and possible ways to prevent post-thyroidectomy hypocalcemia. The purpose of our study is to evaluate the effectiveness of an intraoperative methylene blue spray to identify parathyroid glands during thyroidectomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We have conducted a prospective non-randomised cohort study with 50 patients who underwent hemithyroidectomy or total thyroidectomy between January 2019 and January 2020. During thyroidectomy, 1 ml (10 mg) of 1% methylene blue was sprayed over the parathyroid glands, the inferior thyroid artery, and the recurrent laryngeal nerve. RESULTS: Our study included 50 patients with ages ranging from 18 to 80 years old (43.0+-9.7). We were able to identify the parathyroid glands with the intraoperative methylene blue spray in 82% of cases, with no significant postoperative complications. CONCLUSION: Our study concludes that the methylene blue spray is a safe, feasible, and effective technique to identify parathyroid glands.
