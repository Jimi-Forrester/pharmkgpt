37968136|t|Building safety into CAR-T therapy.
37968136|a|Chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy is an innovative immunotherapeutic approach that utilizes genetically modified T-cells to eliminate cancer cells using the specificity of a monoclonal antibody (mAb) coupled to the potent cytotoxicity of the T-lymphocyte. CAR-T therapy has yielded significant improvements in relapsed/refractory B-cell malignancies. Given these successes, CAR-T has quickly spread to other hematologic malignancies and is being increasingly explored in solid tumors. From early clinical applications to present day, CAR-T cell therapy has been accompanied by significant toxicities, namely cytokine release syndrome (CRS), immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), and on-target off-tumor (OTOT) effects. While medical management has improved for CRS and ICANS, the ongoing threat of refractory symptoms and unanticipated idiosyncratic toxicities highlights the need for more powerful safety measures. This is particularly poignant as CAR T-cell therapy continues to expand into the solid tumor space, where the risk of unpredictable toxicities remains high. We will review CAR-T as an immunotherapeutic approach including emergence of unique toxicities throughout development. We will discuss known and novel strategies to mitigate these toxicities; additional safety challenges in the treatment of solid tumors, and how the inducible Caspase 9 "safety switch" provides an ideal platform for continued exploration.
