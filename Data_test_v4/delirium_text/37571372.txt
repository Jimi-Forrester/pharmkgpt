37571372|a|We previously reported that glycation induces insulin resistance in the hearts of newborn pups from a gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) rat model. Administration of n-3 unsaturated fatty acids suppressed glycation and improved signaling in GDM rat pups. In this study, we investigated their effects on cranial neurons using the GDM rat model and PC12 cells derived from rat adrenal pheochromocytomas. Additionally, we examined whether n-3 and n-7 unsaturated fatty acids (cis-palmitoleic acid [CPA] and trans-palmitoleic acid [TPA]) ameliorate the detrimental effects of high glucose exposure on rats. In the neonatal cerebrum of GDM rats, increased levels of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) inhibited Akt phosphorylation; however, CPA and TPA intake during pregnancy ameliorated these abnormalities. Furthermore, exposure to high-glucose-induced apoptosis in PC12 cells compared to the cells cultured in control glucose. PC12 cells exposed to high-glucose with fatty acids exhibited reduced AGE production and apoptosis induction compared to the high-glucose group. These findings suggest that a hyperglycemic environment during pregnancy promotes AGE formation in brain neuronal proteins and induces apoptosis. Both TPA and CPA mitigated these abnormalities; however, CPA is cytotoxic, highlighting its safety in pregnant women.
