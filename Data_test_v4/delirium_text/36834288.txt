36834288|t|The Use of Optical Coherence Tomography and Electrophysiological Tests in the Early Diagnosis of Inflammatory Changes in the CNS in children with ASD-A Review of Contemporary Literature.
36834288|a|This article is a review of the contemporary literature on the possibility of using modern ophthalmological diagnostics, such as optical coherence tomography and electrophysiological tests, in the assessment of changes in eyesight correlating with inflammatory changes in the central nervous system (CNS) as one of the risk factors for neurodevelopmental disorders in children with ASD. A significant role is attributed to the activation of nerve and glial cells, as well as inflammatory changes in the brain, both of which can be of great importance in regard to an autism development predisposition. This fact indicates the possibility of using certain ophthalmic markers to depict an early correlation between the CNS and its outermost layer, i.e., the retina. A comprehensive ophthalmological assessment, and above all, characteristic changes in the functional function of photoreceptors and disorders of the structures of the retina or optic nerve fibers found in the latest OCT or ERG tests may in the future become diagnostic tools, further confirming the early characteristics of autism in children and adolescents. The above information, therefore, emphasizes the importance of cooperation between specialists in improving the diagnosis and treatment of children with autism.
