39410557|t|Comprehensive Peri-Operative Risk Assessment and Management of Geriatric Patients.
39410557|a|Background: As the population ages, the prevalence of surgical interventions in individuals aged 65+ continues to increase. This poses unique challenges due to the higher incidence of comorbidities, polypharmacy, and frailty in the elderly population, which result in high peri-operative risks. Traditional preoperative risk assessment tools often fail to accurately predict post-operative outcomes in the elderly, overlooking the complex interplay of factors that contribute to risk in the elderly. Methods: A literature review was conducted, focusing on the predictive value of CGA for postoperative prognosis and the implementation of perioperative interventions. Results: Evidence shows that CGA is a superior predictive tool compared to traditional models, as it more accurately identifies elderly patients at higher risk of complications such as postoperative delirium, infections, and prolonged hospital stays. CGA includes assessments of frailty, sarcopenia, nutritional status, cognitive function, mental health, and functional status, which are crucial in predicting post-operative outcomes. Studies demonstrate that CGA can also guide personalized perioperative care, including nutritional support, physical training, and mental health interventions, leading to improved surgical outcomes and reduced functional decline. Conclusions: The CGA provides a more holistic approach to perioperative risk assessment in elderly patients, addressing the limitations of traditional tools. CGA can help guide surgical decisions (e.g., curative or palliative) and select the profiles of patients that will benefit from perioperative interventions to improve their prognosis and prevent functional decline.
