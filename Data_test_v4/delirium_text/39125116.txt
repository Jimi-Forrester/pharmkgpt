39125116|t|A New BODIPY-Based Receptor for the Fluorescent Sensing of Catecholamines.
39125116|a|The human body synthesizes catecholamine neurotransmitters, such as dopamine and noradrenaline. Monitoring the levels of these molecules is crucial for the prevention of important diseases, such as Alzheimer's, schizophrenia, Parkinson's, Huntington's, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and paragangliomas. Here, we have synthesized, characterized, and functionalized the BODIPY core with picolylamine (BDPy-pico) in order to create a sensor capable of detecting these biomarkers. The sensing properties of the BDPy-pico probe in solution were studied using fluorescence titrations and supported by DFT studies. Catecholamine sensing was also performed in the solid state by a simple strip test, using an optical fiber as the detector of emissions. In addition, the selectivity and recovery of the sensor were assessed, suggesting the possibility of using this receptor to detect dopamine and norepinephrine in human saliva.
