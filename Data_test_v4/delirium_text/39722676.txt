39722676|a|Highly reactive metabolic intermediates and other small molecules frequently react with amino acid side chains, leading to non-enzymatic posttranslational modifications (nPTMs) of proteins. The abundance of these modifications increases under high metabolic activity or stress conditions and can dramatically impact protein structure and function. Although protein quality control mechanisms typically mitigate the effects of these impaired proteins, in long-lived and degradation-resistant proteins, nPTMs accumulate. In some cases, such as cataract development and diabetes, clear links between nPTMs, aging, and disease progression have been established. In neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, a key question is whether accumulation of nPTMs is a cause or consequence of protein aggregation. This review focuses on major nPTMs found on proteins with central roles in neurodegenerative diseases such as alpha-synuclein, beta-amyloid, and tau. We summarize current knowledge on the formation of these modifications and discuss their potential impact on disease onset and progression. Additionally, we examine what is known to date about how nPTMs impair cellular detoxification, repair, and degradation systems. Finally, we critically discuss the available methodologies to systematically investigate nPTMs at the molecular level and outline suitable approaches to study their effects on protein aggregation. We aim to foster more research into the role of nPTMs in neurodegeneration by adapting methodologies that have proven successful in studying enzymatic posttranslational modifications. Specifically, we advocate for site-specific incorporation of these modifications into target proteins using advanced chemical and molecular biology techniques.
