37891783|a|The COVID-19 pandemic generated, in addition to severe symptoms, hospitalizations and deaths worldwide, as well as stress from the fear of the disease and social uncertainties, from restriction measures and social isolation. Stress from social isolation impacts mental health, aggravating existing conditions and triggering neuropsychiatric symptoms in individuals with biopsychosocial vulnerability. During and immediately after the period of social restriction imposed by the pandemic, the scientific community carried out several research protocols. These revealed results that relevantly demonstrate the harmful effect of the stress induced by the pandemic situation. This narrative review reports and discusses research results demonstrating impairments in psychiatric disorders such as autism spectrum disorder, dementia, eating disorders, schizophrenia, anxiety, and depression. In this sense, the community has identified a significant negative influence of social isolation on the mental health of individuals through the modification of individual routines and the absence of social interactions. Moreover, the community identified perceived differences related to the impacts on men and women. In addition to studies showing the effect of social isolation on disorders, an evaluation of protocols with some possible therapeutic intervention strategies during times of social restriction was developed.
