33050407|t|Bullous Pemphigoid: Trigger and Predisposing Factors.
33050407|a|Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is the most frequent autoimmune subepidermal blistering disease provoked by autoantibodies directed against two hemidesmosomal proteins: BP180 and BP230. Its pathogenesis depends on the interaction between predisposing factors, such as human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes, comorbidities, aging, and trigger factors. Several trigger factors, such as drugs, thermal or electrical burns, surgical procedures, trauma, ultraviolet irradiation, radiotherapy, chemical preparations, transplants, and infections may induce or exacerbate BP disease. Identification of predisposing and trigger factors can increase the understanding of BP pathogenesis. Furthermore, an accurate anamnesis focused on the recognition of a possible trigger factor can improve prognosis by promptly removing it.
