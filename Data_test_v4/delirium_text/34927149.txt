34927149|a|Background: Because psychosomatic diseases are pathological conditions, it is difficult to identify their degrees. The armchair sign is a test used to assess voluntary muscle relaxation. Objective: We aimed to evaluate the usefulness of the armchair sign for the diagnosis of psychosomatic-prone myofascial pain syndrome (MPS) in patients with incurable cancer. Design: This was a secondary analysis of a prospective multicenter observational clinical study. Setting/Patients: Patients with incurable cancer who were referred to palliative care services at five institutions in Japan between March 2018 and December 2018. Results: A total of 101 patients were enrolled, of whom 44 met MPS diagnostic criteria. Of these, 27 patients (61.3%) had psychosomatic-prone MPS. There was a significant association between the armchair sign and psychosomatic-prone MPS (p = 0.002). Sensitivity and specificity were 40.7% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 18.0-63.4) and 100.0%, respectively. The area under the curve score was 0.704 (95% CI: 0.553-0.855). Conclusions: The armchair sign may be useful as an ancillary test for the diagnosis of psychosomatic-prone MPS in patients with incurable cancer. Trial Registration: UMIN000031338.
