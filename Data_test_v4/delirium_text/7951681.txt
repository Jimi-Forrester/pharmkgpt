7951681|a|The density of senile plaques (SP) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) was estimated at post-mortem in areas B17 and B18 of the visual cortex in 18 Alzheimer's disease (AD) cases which varied in disease onset and duration. The density of SP in B17 and NFT in B17 and B18 declined significantly with age at death of the patient. The density of SP and NFT was greater in B18 than B17 but only in cases of earlier onset and shorter duration. The pathological differences between B17 and B18 could explain the visual evoked responses (VER) that have been reported in AD. However, the differences were small, and changes in the afferent pathways remain the most likely explanation for the VER in AD.
