39105366|t|Modification of an AIE Fluorescent Probe for Monitoring the Polarity of Lipid Droplets Based on a series of Synthesized Aryl Naphthalizes.
39105366|a|Lipid droplets (LDs) are subcellular organelles that are dynamic and play a central role in energy homeostasis and lipid metabolism. They also contribute to the transport and maturation of cellular proteins and are closely associated with several diseases. The important role of the cellular microenvironment in maintaining cellular homeostasis. Changes in cell polarity, particularly in organelles, have been found to be strongly linked to inflammation, Alzheimer's disease, cancer, and other illnesses. It is essential to check the polarity of the LDs. A series of arylated naphthalimide derivatives were synthesized using the Suzuki reaction. Modification of synthesized aryl naphthalimides using oligomeric PEG based on intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) mechanism. A series of fluorescent probes were designed to target LDs and detect their polarity. Nap-TPA-PEG3 probe exhibited high sensitivity to polarity. The addition of oligomeric polyethylene glycol (PEG) to the probe not only significantly improved its solubility in water, but also effectively reduced its cytotoxicity. In addition, the probe exhibited excellent aggregation-induced luminescence (AIE) properties and solvent discolouration effects. Nap-TPA-PEG3 probe exhibited high Pearson correlation coefficient (0.957163) in lipid droplet co-localization in cells. Nap-TPA-PEG3 could be used as an effective hand tool to monitor cell polarity.
