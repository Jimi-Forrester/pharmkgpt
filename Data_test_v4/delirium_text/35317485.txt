35317485|a|Introduction: Altered mental status (AMS) in the Emergency Department (ED) can be associated with morbidity and mortality. In high income countries, mortality rate is under 10% for patients presenting with AMS. There is a paucity of data on the profile and mortality amongst this group of patients in limited income countries. Methods: this was a prospective cohort study of adults >=18 years presenting to the Emergency Departments of Muhimbili National Hospital (MNH) Upanga and Mloganzila in Tanzania with Altered Mental Status (AMS) unrelated to psychiatric illness or trauma, from August 2019 to February 2020. Patient demographic data, clinical profile, disposition and 7-day outcome were recorded. The outcome of mortality was summarized using descriptive statistics. Results: among 26,125 patients presenting during the study period, 2,311 (8.9%) patients had AMS and after exclusion for trauma and psychiatric etiology, 226 (9.8%) patients were included. The median age was 56 years (43-69 years) and 127 (56.2%) were male. Confusion 88 (38.9%) was the most common presenting symptom. Hypertension 121 (53.5%) was the most frequent associated comorbidity. The overall mortality was 80 (35.4%) within 7 days. Of 173 patients admitted to the wards, 54 (31.2%) died and of the 46 (20.4%) admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), 20 (43.5%) died within 7 days. Six (2.7%) patients died in the emergency department. Conclusion: patients with AMS presenting to two EDs in Tanzania have substantially higher mortality than reported from Hospital Incident Command System (HICS). This could be due to underlying disease, comorbidities or management. Further research could help identify individual etiologies involved and high risk groups which can cater to better understanding this population.
