10673961|a|This article reviews the development of the subspeciality of psycho-oncology and its contributions to patient care, encouraging more attention to and research into the care of the total patient: the physical, psychological, social and spiritual aspects of care. The result is enhanced quality of life as the patient is studied in the domains of living that are important, extending across the continuum of care from diagnosis to palliative care. In addition, cancer prevention and early detection depends largely on changing attitudes and behaviours that put people at greater risk. This is an important area of research for psycho-oncologists. In the past two decades, research has contributed to our understanding of the psychological responses that accompany a cancer diagnosis. Oncologists better recognise psychological distress and psychiatric disorders such as anxiety, depression and delirium (in hospitalised patients) as frequent comorbid disorders. The development of valid assessment tools for the patients' self-report has been important. Increasingly, outcome measures in controlled trials of new therapies include quality of life, and no longer look at survival alone. The future will continue to bring new challenges to psycho-oncology as patients face new challenges in treatment. A major aim of the next century will be to bring this integrated approach to all patients in an affordable manner.
