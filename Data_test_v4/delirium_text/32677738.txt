32677738|a|Naringenin is a natural dihydro flavonoid that is abundant in grapefruit. Previous studies suggested the cognition protective effect of naringenin in various cognitive deficits models, such as type 2 diabetic rat model and chemicals (e.g., lipopolysaccharide, scopolamine) treated rodents. However, the effects of naringenin on aging animals and the potential mechanisms are still unclear. In this study, we investigated the influence of naringenin administration on learning deficits in aging mice. High-fat diet-fed SAMP8 mice were employed as an age-related model of Alzheimer's disease. Dietary administration of 0.2% naringenin for 12 weeks significantly improved the spatial learning and memory performance of the high-fat diet-fed SAMP8 mice in both Barnes Maze test and Morris Water Maze test. Further mechanism research indicated that naringenin reduced Abeta production, tau-hyperphosphorylation, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation in the brain. This research provides further evidence for the treatment effect of naringenin on Alzheimer's disease. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Naringenin, also known as 4',5,7-thrihydroxyflflavanone, is a natural dihydro flavonoid that is abundant in grapefruit and other citrus fruits. The current study first demonstrated the improvement effect of naringenin on cognition deficits in HFD-fed SAMP8 mice, an aging mouse model. Potential mechanisms were also systematically explained by exploring the amyloid-beta (Abeta) accumulation, tau hyperphosphorylation, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation in the brain of mice. This study provides further evidence for the utilization of naringenin as an effective treatment agent for Alzheimer's disease.
