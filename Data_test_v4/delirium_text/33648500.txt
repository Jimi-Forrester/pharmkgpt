33648500|t|Protective role of Clitoria ternatea L. flower extract on methylglyoxal-induced protein glycation and oxidative damage to DNA.
33648500|a|BACKGROUND: Methylglyoxal (MG) is a highly reactive dicarbonyl precursor for the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) associated with age-related diseases, including diabetes and its complications. Clitoria ternatea L. flower has been reported to possess antioxidant and antiglycating properties. Evidence indicates that the extract of Clitoria ternatea L. flower inhibits fructose-induced protein glycation and oxidative damage to bovine serum albumin (BSA). However, there is no evidence to support the inhibitory effect of CTE against MG-mediated protein glycation and oxidative damage to protein and DNA. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate whether C. ternatea flower extract (CTE) prevents MG-induced protein glycation and oxidative DNA damage. METHODS: The formation of fluorescent AGEs in BSA was evaluated using spectrofluorometer. The protein carbonyl and thiol group content were used for detecting protein oxidation. DNA strand breakage in a glycation model comprising of MG, lysine and Cu2+ or a free radical generator 2,2'-azobis(2-methylpropionamidine) dihydrochloride (AAPH) systems was investigated using gel electrophoresis. Generation of superoxide anions and hydroxyl radicals in the MG/lysine system was assessed by the cytochrome c reduction assay and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances assay, respectively. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used to measure the MG-trapping ability. RESULTS: In the BSA/MG system, CTE (0.25-1 mg/mL) significantly inhibited the formation of fluorescent AGEs and protein oxidation by reducing protein carbonyl content as well as preventing the protein thiol depletion. The concentration of CTE at 0.125-1 mg/mL prevented oxidative DNA cleavage in MG/lysine and AAPH systems associated with the inhibition of superoxide anion and hydroxyl radical formation. It also directly trapped MG in a concentration-dependent manner, ranging from 15 to 43%. CONCLUSIONS: The study findings suggest that the direct carbonyl trapping ability and the free radical scavenging activity of CTE are the underlying mechanisms responsible for the prevention of protein glycation and oxidative DNA damage.
