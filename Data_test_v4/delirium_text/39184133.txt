39184133|a|Introduction: Geriatric fracture is a pressing global health issue, marked by elevated mortality and morbidity rates and escalating health care costs. The evolving health care system from fee-for-service to quality-based reimbursement has led to externally driven reward and reimbursement systems that may not account for the complexity of caring for older adults with fracture. Significance: The aim of this review is to highlight the need for a shift towards meaningful metrics that impact geriatric fracture care and to issue a call to action for all medical societies to advocate for national reimbursement and ranking systems that focus on metrics that truly matter. Results: Traditional metrics, while easier to capture, may not necessarily represent high quality care and may even have unintentional adverse consequences. For example, the focus on reducing length of stay may lead to older patients being discharged too early, without adequately addressing pain, constipation, or delirium. In addition, a focus on mortality may miss the opportunity to deliver compassionate end-of-life care. Existing geriatric fracture care metrics have expanded beyond traditional metrics to include assessment by geriatricians, fracture prevention, and delirium assessments. However, there is a need to further consider and develop patient-focused metrics. The Age-Friendly Health Initiative (4 Ms), which includes Mobility, Medication, Mentation, and what Matters is an evidence-based framework for assessing and acting on critical issues in the care of older adults. Additional metrics that should be considered include an assessment of nutrition and secondary fracture prevention. Conclusion: In the realm of geriatric fracture care, the metrics currently employed often revolve around adherence to established guidelines and are heavily influenced by financial considerations. It is crucial to shift the paradigm towards metrics that truly matter for geriatric fracture patients, recognizing the multifaceted nature of their care and the profound impact these fractures have on their lives.
