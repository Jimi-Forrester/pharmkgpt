37316917|t|Cerebral Semaphorin3D is a novel risk factor for age-associated cognitive impairment.
37316917|a|BACKGROUND: We previously reported that miR-195 exerts neuroprotection by inhibiting Sema3A and cerebral miR-195 levels decreased with age, both of which urged us to explore the role of miR-195 and miR-195-regulated Sema3 family members in age-associated dementia. METHODS: miR-195a KO mice were used to assess the effect of miR-195 on aging and cognitive functions. Sema3D was predicted as a miR-195 target by TargetScan and then verified by luciferase reporter assay, while effects of Sema3D and miR-195 on neural senescence were assessed by beta-galactosidase and dendritic spine density. Cerebral Sema3D was over-expressed by lentivirus and suppressed by si-RNA, and effects of over-expression of Sema3D and knockdown of miR-195 on cognitive functions were assessed by Morris Water Maze, Y-maze, and open field test. The effect of Sema3D on lifespan was assessed in Drosophila. Sema3D inhibitor was developed using homology modeling and virtual screening. One-way and two-way repeated measures ANOVA were applied to assess longitudinal data on mouse cognitive tests. RESULTS: Cognitive impairment and reduced density of dendritic spine were observed in miR-195a knockout mice. Sema3D was identified to be a direct target of miR-195 and a possible contributor to age-associated neurodegeneration as Sema3D levels showed age-dependent increase in rodent brains. Injection of Sema3D-expressing lentivirus caused significant memory deficits while silencing hippocampal Sema3D improved cognition. Repeated injections of Sema3D-expressing lentivirus to elevate cerebral Sema3D for 10 weeks revealed a time-dependent decline of working memory. More importantly, analysis of the data on the Gene Expression Omnibus database showed that Sema3D levels were significantly higher in dementia patients than normal controls (p < 0.001). Over-expression of homolog Sema3D gene in the nervous system of Drosophila reduced locomotor activity and lifespan by 25%. Mechanistically, Sema3D might reduce stemness and number of neural stem cells and potentially disrupt neuronal autophagy. Rapamycin restored density of dendritic spines in the hippocampus from mice injected with Sema3D lentivirus. Our novel small molecule increased viability of Sema3D-treated neurons and might improve autophagy efficiency, which suggested Sema3D could be a potential drug target. Video Abstract CONCLUSION: Our results highlight the importance of Sema3D in age-associated dementia. Sema3D could be a novel drug target for dementia treatment.
