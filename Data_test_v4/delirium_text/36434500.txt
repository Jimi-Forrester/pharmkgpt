36434500|a|BACKGROUND: We assessed the relationships between levels of preoperative thyroid hormone (TH), cortisol, interleukin-2 (IL-2), and procalcitonin (PCT) and postoperative delirium (POD) in acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) patients receiving modified triple-branched stent-graft (MTBSG) implant surgeries. METHODS: ATAAD patients received MTBSG implant surgeries in our hospital between February 2019 and December 2020 were recruited. We separated them into a POD and non-POD cohort and employed univariable and multivariable regression analysis to establish independent correlations between preoperative THs, cortisol, IL-2, and PCT and POD. In addition, we conducted stratification analyses to examine the link between pre-surgical THs and POD in normal TSH and lower TSH subgroups. RESULTS: POD occurred in 78 of 224 patients (34.8%). POD patients exhibited markedly reduced preoperative free triiodothyronine (FT3) (P = 0.008) and free thyroxine (FT4) (P = 0.023) levels, while remarkably enhanced preoperative cortisol (P < 0.001), IL-2 (P < 0.001), and PCT (P < 0.001) levels. Based on multivariate regression analysis, reduced preoperative FT3 (P = 0.032), as well as augmented preoperative IL-2 (P = 0.001), cortisol (P < 0.001), and PCT (P = 0.016) were strong stand-alone risk factors for POD. Moreover, subgroup analysis found the association between FT3 (P = 0.029), FT4 (P = 0.042) and POD was both significant in patients with normal TSH levels. CONCLUSIONS: Reduced preoperative FT3 and elevated preoperative cortisol, IL-2, and PCT were strong indicators of POD in ATAAD patients. Hence, we recommend that the thyroid function, cortisol, PCT, and IL-2 should be evaluated prior to surgery in ATAAD patients.
