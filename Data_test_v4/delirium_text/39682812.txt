39682812|t|Screening of a Fraction with Higher Amyloid beta Aggregation Inhibitory Activity from a Library Containing 210 Mushroom Extracts Using a Microliter-Scale High-Throughput Screening System with Quantum Dot Imaging.
39682812|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a highly prevalent neurodegenerative disease hallmarked by amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Amyloid plaques are formed by the amyloid beta (Abeta) aggregation, so substances that inhibit this aggregation are useful for preventing and treating AD. Mushrooms are widely used medicinal fungi with high edible and nutritional value. Mushrooms have a variety of biologically active ingredients, and studies have shown that they have certain effects in anti-bacterial, anti-oxidation, anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, and immune regulation. Previously, we developed a microliter-scale high-throughput screening (MSHTS) system using quantum dot (QD) nanoprobes to screen Abeta aggregation inhibitors. In this study, we appraised the Abeta aggregation inhibitory activity of 210 natural mushrooms from Hokkaido (Japan) and found 11 samples with high activity. We then selected Elfvingia applanata and Fuscoporia obliqua for extraction and purification as these samples were able to suppress Abeta-induced neurocytotoxicity and were readily available in large quantities. We found that the ethyl acetate (EtOAc) extract of E. applanata has high Abeta aggregation inhibitory activity, so we performed silica gel column chromatography fractionation and found that fraction 5 (f5) of the EtOAc extract displayed the highest Abeta aggregation inhibitory activity among all mushroom samples. The half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) value was 2.30 microg/mL, higher than the EC50 of 10.7 microg/mL for rosmarinic acid, a well-known Abeta aggregation inhibitor. This inhibitory activity decreased with further purification, suggesting that some compounds act synergistically. The f5 fraction also inhibited the deposition of Abeta aggregates on the cell surface of human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. Our expectation is that f5, with additional tests, may eventually prove to be an inhibitor for the prevention of AD.
