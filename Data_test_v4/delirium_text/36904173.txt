36904173|t|Eating Vegetables First Regardless of Eating Speed Has a Significant Reducing Effect on Postprandial Blood Glucose and Insulin in Young Healthy Women: Randomized Controlled Cross-Over Study.
36904173|a|People with fast eating habits have been reported to have an increased risk of diabetes and obesity. To explore whether the speed of eating a test meal (tomato, broccoli, fried fish, and boiled white rice) influences postprandial blood glucose, insulin, triglyceride, and free fatty acid levels, 18 young, healthy women consumed a 671 kcal breakfast at fast speed (10 min) and slow speed (20 min) with vegetables first and slow speed (20 min) with carbohydrate first on three separate days. This study was conducted using a within-participants cross-over design in which all participants consumed identical meals of three different eating speeds and food orders. Significant ameliorations of both fast and slow eating with vegetables first regimen on postprandial blood glucose and insulin levels at 30 and 60 min were observed compared with those of slow eating with carbohydrates first. In addition, the standard deviation, large amplitude of excursion, and incremental area under the curve for blood glucose and insulin in both fast and slow eating with vegetables first were all significantly lower than those of slow eating with carbohydrate first. Interestingly, there was no significant difference between fast and slow eating on postprandial blood glucose and insulin levels as long as vegetables were consumed first, although postprandial blood glucose at 30 min was significantly lower in slow eating with vegetables first than that of fast eating with the same food order. These results suggest that food order with vegetables first and carbohydrate last ameliorates postprandial blood glucose and insulin concentrations even if the meal was consumed at fast speed.
