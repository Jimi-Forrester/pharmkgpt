37550180|a|ObjectiveThe objective of this study was to evaluate changes in the inclusion of pertinent information on electronic discharge summaries (eDS) after implementation of a revised template and electronic medical record (EMR) workflow.MethodsA retrospective medical record audit of eDS at three metropolitan hospitals was undertaken for adult inpatient encounters in June 2021 (pre-intervention, n = 100) and June 2022 (post-intervention, n = 100). The eDS were evaluated against 16 components listed in the Australian National Guidelines for the On-Screen Display of Discharge Summaries. Nine components were further broken down to between two and 11 sub-components. Sub-analysis compared a hospital with full EMR to pooled results from hospitals with hybrid EMRs. Components and sub-components were evaluated for inclusion only; accuracy or relevance of the information was not assessed.ResultsInclusion of three out of 16 components (presentation details: 47% vs 62%, problems and diagnosis: 61% vs 86% and recipient details: 82% vs 93%) and eight out of 36 sub-components (discharge destination, principal diagnosis, history of presenting complaint, infection risk, pressure injury, screening and/or diagnosis of delirium and GP phone number and address) was higher in the post-intervention group (all P < 0.05). Reduced eDS information inclusion in the post-intervention group was observed for discharge date and falls risk only (both P < 0.05). Reporting of falls history decreased at the hospital with full EMR (71% vs 20% P < 0.001) but not at hospitals utilising hybrid EMRs (24% vs 30% P = 0.5).ConclusionThe intervention was associated with improved inclusion of pertinent information as described in the Australian National Guidelines for the On-Screen Display of Discharge Summaries.
