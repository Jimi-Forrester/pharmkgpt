37005386|a|OBJECTIVE: The aims of our study were to identify distinct trajectories of cognitive function using the group-based trajectory model. We also investigate which demographic factors act as risk factors for cognitive decline in each group. METHODS: The data from the Seoul National University Hospital Healthcare System Gangnam Center, from 2005 to 2019. The number of study subjects was 637. We used a group-based model to identify cognitive function trajectories. Multinomial logistic regression was employed to define risk factors for cognitive function decline. RESULTS: The cognitive function trajectories among adults over 40 years of age were heterogeneous. We identified four trajectories: high (27.3%), medium (41.0%), low (22.7%), and rapid decline (9.1%). Older age, male, low educational level, bad dietary habits, diabetes mellitus, technical worker, and lower income increased the likelihood of a cognitive function decline. CONCLUSION: A younger age, a higher educational level, professional worker, good dietary habits, no diabetes mellitus, and no obesity improved cognitive function. A combination of these factors can improve "cognitive reserve" and delay cognitive decline. Interventions to prevent cognitive decline are needed after identification of high-risk groups for cognitive decline.
