26315306|t|Characterization of Selenoprotein M and Its Response to Selenium Deficiency in Chicken Brain.
26315306|a|Selenoprotein M (SelM) may function as thiol disulfide oxidoreductase that participates in the formation of disulfide bonds and can be implicated in calcium responses. SelM may have a functional role in catalyzing free radicals and has been associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, studies of SelM in chicken remain very limited. In this study, two groups of day-old broiler chicks (n = 40/group) were fed a corn-soy basal diet (BD, 13 mug Se/kg) and BD supplemented with Se (as sodium selenite) at 0.3 mg/kg. The brain was collected at 14, 21, 28, and 42 days of age. We performed a sequence analysis and predicted the structure and function of SelM. We also investigated the effects of Se deficiency on the expression of Selt, Selw, and Selm and the Se status in the chicken brain. The results show that Se deficiency induced the lower (P < 0.05) Se content, glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and catalase (CAT) activities; increased (P < 0.05) malondialdehyde (MDA) content; and reduced (P < 0.05) the expression of Selm messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein abundance of SelM in the brain. However, there were no significant brain Selt and Selw mRNA levels by dietary Se deficiency in chicks. The different regulations of these three redox (Rdx) protein expressions by Se deficiency represent a novel finding of the present study. Our results demonstrated that SelM may have an important role in protecting against oxidative damage in the brain of chicken, which might shed light on the role of SelM in human neurodegenerative disease. More studies are needed to confirm our conclusion.
