37355483|t|Comparing outcomes of total hip arthroplasty versus hemiarthroplasty in neck of femur fracture patients: an Australian registry study.
37355483|a|PURPOSE: To determine discharge outcomes of displaced subcapital NOF patients who were from home, with intact pre-operative cognition, ASA 1 or 2 and independent walkers treated with either THA or hemiarthroplasty. METHODS: A retrospective registry study was performed using data from the Australia and New Zealand Hip Fracture Registry (ANZHFR). Institutional ethics approval was obtained prior to commencement. Hip fracture registry records between 1st January 2016 and 31st January 2020 were reviewed. RESULTS: A total of 930 patients with complete records were identified and included. There were 602 THA and 328 hemiarthroplasty patients. Using multivariate analysis, pre-operative factors associated with THA include younger age (OR = 0.90 for every year older, p < 0.001), females (p = 0.043), private admissions (OR = 1.62, p = 0.028) and receiving pre-operative geriatric assessment (OR = 1.89, p = 0.002). Delay to theatre due to not being fit for surgery was associated with not receiving THA (OR = 0.21, p < 0.001). THA resulted in a shorter total hospital length of stay (MD = 7.24, p < 0.001), higher likelihood of being discharged home (OR = 1.88, p < 0.001) and lower likelihood of being discharged to a residential aged care facility (OR = 0.32, p = 0.019). CONCLUSION: Displaced subcapital NOF patients who were admitted from home, had intact pre-operative cognition, ASA 1 or 2, independent walkers and had THAs, had shorter total hospital length of stay, were more likely to be discharged home directly and less likely to end up in residential aged care facilities compared to those undergoing hemiarthroplasty.
