21900234|t|Amyloid-beta-induced synapse damage is mediated via cross-linkage of cellular prion proteins.
21900234|a|The cellular prion protein (PrP(C)), which is highly expressed at synapses, was identified as a receptor for the amyloid-beta (Abeta) oligomers that are associated with dementia in Alzheimer disease. Here, we report that Abeta oligomers secreted by 7PA2 cells caused synapse damage in cultured neurons via a PrP(C)-dependent process. Exogenous PrP(C) added to Prnp knock-out((0/0)) neurons was targeted to synapses and significantly increased Abeta-induced synapse damage. In contrast, the synapse damage induced by a phospholipase A(2)-activating peptide was independent of PrP(C). In Prnp wild-type((+/+)) neurons Abeta oligomers activated synaptic cytoplasmic phospholipase A(2) (cPLA(2)). In these cells, the addition of Abeta oligomers triggered the translocation of cPLA(2) in synapses to cholesterol dense membranes (lipid rafts) where it formed a complex also containing Abeta and PrP(C). In contrast, the addition of Abeta to Prnp((0/0)) neurons did not activate synaptic cPLA(2), which remained in the cytoplasm and was not associated with Abeta. Filtration assays and non-denaturing gels demonstrated that Abeta oligomers cross-link PrP(C). We propose that it is the cross-linkage of PrP(C) by Abeta oligomers that triggers abnormal activation of cPLA(2) and synapse damage. This hypothesis was supported by our observation that monoclonal antibody mediated cross-linkage of PrP(C) also activated synaptic cPLA(2) and caused synapse damage.
