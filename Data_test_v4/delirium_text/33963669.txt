33963669|a|While screening for natural product scaffolds as potential anti-Alzheimer's disease (AD), oxymatrine (OMT) was found to relieve symptoms of AD through diminishing death of neuronal cells caused by microglia-induced inflammation. In this study, 13 derivatives of OMT were synthesized and their neuroprotective effects were evaluated on Abeta1-42 -induced PC12 cells using MTT method. In addition, the best neuroprotective potencies were obtained with compounds 4, 6e, and 6f, which were selected for evaluation of decrease in IL-1beta and TNF-alpha in Abeta1-42 -treated PC12 cells. Collectively, these data reveal that derivatives 6e and 6f possess the best ability of diminish IL-1beta production and reverse cell damage in all compounds, which are possible to develop as therapeutic agents for AD.
