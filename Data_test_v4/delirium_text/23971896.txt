23971896|a|Beverages are an ideal format to offer nutrients, specific health-promoting functionality, and desirable sensory attributes to consumers. Taking into account previous research on Spergularia rubra (L.) J. Presl & C. Presl, the aim of this work was to describe the chemistry and biochemistry associated with the production of a new iced tea base herbal beverage containing a hydroethanolic extract of this species, including both naturally occurring and added components. Phenolic compounds of S. rubra hydroethanolic extract and of the iced tea base herbal beverage were determined by HPLC-DAD. Thirty compounds, comprising nonacylated C-glycosyl flavones, C-glycosyl flavones acylated with aromatic acids, and C-glycosyl flavones acylated with aliphatic acids, were identified, being essentially represented by apigenin derivatives. Organic acids of both samples were determined by HPLC-UV, malic acid being the major one. A strong inhibition of alpha-glucosidase, acetylcholinesterase, and butyrylcholinesterase was observed. Furthermore, the influence of the pH of the digestive tube on the chemical composition of both extract and iced tea base herbal beverage and, consequently, on their biological activity, was assessed. In a general way, pH variation significantly decreased (p < 0.05) the metabolites content and enzymes inhibitory capacity. Nevertheless, the beverage enriched with S. rubra extract represents a valuable addition to consumer's health and nutrition, once the loss of activity is lower than the one verified for the base iced tea. Thus, the results suggest that the ingestion of this beverage could be of potential interest for several chronic disorders, particularly Alzheimer's disease.
