33563685|a|This manuscript describes the case of a young woman, with no prior psychiatric history, who developed hypomania and paranoia as the principal presenting features of Graves' disease. After starting treatment with carbimazole and propranolol, symptoms resolved without the use of antipsychotic drugs. Close liaison between psychiatry and endocrinology services was essential. This demonstrates that treating underlying thyrotoxicosis in patients presenting with psychiatric symptoms may lead to recovery without the use of antipsychotic medication. While agitation, irritability and mood lability are well-recognised thyrotoxic symptoms, psychosis is a rare presenting feature of Graves' disease. All patients with agitation, delirium or psychiatric symptoms should have thyroid function checked as part of initial tests screening for organic disease. In new or relapsing psychiatric conditions, it is important to ask patients, their carers or relatives about symptoms of hypothyroidism or thyrotoxicosis.
