21728062|t|c-Abl in neurodegenerative disease.
21728062|a|The c-Abl tyrosine kinase participates in a variety of cellular functions, including regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, regulation of the cell cycle, and the apoptotic/cell cycle arrest response to stress, and the Abl family of kinases has been shown to play a crucial role in development of the central nervous system. Recent studies have shown c-Abl activation in human Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases and c-Abl activation in mouse models and neuronal culture in response to amyloid beta fibrils and oxidative stress. Overexpression of active c-Abl in adult mouse neurons results in neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation. Based on this evidence, a potential role for c-Abl in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disease is discussed, and we attempt to place activation of c-Abl in context with other known contributors to neurodegenerative pathology.
