35308758|t|Cognitive Impairment in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.
35308758|a|Objective To determine the incidence of cognitive impairment established on the mini-mental state assessment in type 2 diabetic patients presenting at Holy Family Hospital, Rawalpindi. Materials and methods This cross-sectional descriptive study was carried out from June 2019 to December 2019. Individuals with a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus were included, and detailed history, physical examination, and biochemical variables were noted. They were assessed through Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) (Urdu translation) to look for the primary outcome variable, i.e., cognitive impairment. All patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus diagnosed at least one year back, irrespective of gender, were included in this investigation. Patients with a previous history of head injury, epilepsy, stroke, those on an antidepressant or antipsychotic medications, those with deranged renal function tests, and those already diagnosed with dementia were excluded from the study. Results Three hundred thirty-two patients meeting the inclusion criteria were included in the study. The mean +- standard deviation age of the study population was 65.32 +- 11.33 years, with maximum age being 80 years and the minimum being 50 years. Two hundred patients (60.24%) were below 65 years of age, and 132 patients (39.76%) were 65 years of age or above. Two hundred sixteen (65.06%) were males, and 116 (34.96%) were females. The mean duration of diabetes mellitus (DM) was 10.17 +- 4.81. The mean MMSE score was 22.69 +- 5.26. Out of 332 patients, 81 (24.4%) patients had cognitive impairment. Patients who were 65 or older had a significantly higher proportion of cognitive impairment, compared to those below 65 years of age (p-value = 0.0214). There was no significant difference in the proportion of cognitively impaired patients between males and females (p-value = 0.2497). Similarly, there was no significant difference between those who were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes for 10 years or more and those who were diagnosed less than 10 years ago (p-value = 0.3791). Conclusion Cognitive impairment is common in individuals having type 2 diabetes mellitus. It is also associated with the increasing age of diabetic patients. However, cognitive impairment in type 2 diabetes mellitus is not associated with gender. In addition, there is no significant difference in cognitive impairment between the patients who were diagnosed with diabetes more than 10 years ago and those who had it diagnosed less than 10 years ago.
