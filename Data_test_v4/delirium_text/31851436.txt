31851436|a|OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the effectiveness of ramelteon and suvorexant for delirium prevention in real-world practice. It explored whether ramelteon and/or suvorexant would affect delirium prevention among both patients at risk for but without delirium (patients at risk) and those with delirium the night before a consultation. METHODS: This multicenter, prospective, observational study was conducted by trained psychiatrists at consultation-liaison psychiatric services from October 1, 2017, to October 7, 2018. Patients who were aged 65 years or older and hospitalized because of acute diseases or elective surgery, had risk factors for delirium, and had insomnia or delirium on the night before the consultation were prescribed ramelteon and/or suvorexant. The decision to take medication was left to the discretion of each patient. The primary outcome was incidence of delirium based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, during the first 7 days. RESULTS: Among 526 patients at risk, those taking ramelteon and/or suvorexant developed delirium significantly less frequently than those who did not, after control for the effects of risk factors on the estimate of an independent association between the effects of ramelteon and/or suvorexant and the outcome of developing delirium (15.7% vs 24.0%; odds ratio [OR] = 0.48;, 95% CI, 0.29-0.80; P = .005). Similar results were found among 422 patients with delirium (39.9% vs 66.3%; OR = 0.36; 95% CI, 0.22-0.59; P < .0001). CONCLUSIONS: Ramelteon and suvorexant appear to be effective for delirium prevention in real-world practice.
