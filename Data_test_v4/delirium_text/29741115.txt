29741115|t|The Role of Biomaterials in Implantation for Central Nervous System Injury.
29741115|a|Permanent deficits that occur in memory, sensation, and cognition can result from central nervous system (CNS) trauma that causes dysfunction and/or unregulated CNS regeneration. Some therapeutic approaches are preferentially applied to the human body. Therefore, cell transplantation, one of the therapeutic strategies, may be used to benefit people. However, poor cell viability and low efficacy are the limitations to cell transplantation strategies. Biomaterials have been widely used in several fields (e.g., triggering cell differentiation, guiding cell migration, improving wound healing, and increasing tissue regeneration) by modulating their characteristics in chemistry, topography, and softness/stiffness for highly flexible application. We reviewed implanted biomaterials to investigate the roles and influences of physical/chemical properties on cell behaviors and applications. With their unique molecular features, biomaterials are delivered in several methods and mixed with transplanted cells, which assists in increasing postimplanted biological substance efficiency on cell survival, host responses, and functional recovery of animal models. Moreover, tracking the routes of these transplanted cells using biomaterials as labeling agents is crucial for addressing their location, distribution, activity, and viability. Here, we provide comprehensive comments and up-to-date research of the application of biomaterials.
