33091416|a|A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) emerged from Wuhan, China, and spread quickly around the world. In addition to fever, cough and shortness of breath, it was confirmed that the patients also have manifestations towards the central nervous system (CNS), especially those critically ill ones. In this review, we will discuss how SARS-CoV-2 gain access to the CNS and the possible consequences. Both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 in 2002 share the same receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which can be found in the brain and mediate the disease process. Both direct attack of SARS-CoV-2 and the abnormal immune response in the CNS would contribute to the disease. Also, there is a relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and the occurrence of acute cerebrovascular diseases.
