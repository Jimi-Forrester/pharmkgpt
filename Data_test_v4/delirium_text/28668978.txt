28668978|t|Prognostic value of tricuspid regurgitation velocity and probability of pulmonary hypertension in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation.
28668978|a|Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is associated with adverse clinical outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). We sought to investigate the effects of tricuspid regurgitant velocity (TRV) and echocardiographic probability of PH on clinical outcomes of patients undergoing TAVI. A total of 148 consecutive patients undergoing TAVI were included and stratified as having "low" (TRV <=2.8 m/s), "intermediate" (TRV 2.9-3.4 m/s), and "high" (TRV >3.4 m/s) probability of PH. Only the patients from the "high" probability group were considered as patients with PH. All-cause mortality, complications rate and quality of life (QoL) were assessed according to VARC-2 recommendations. Of 148 patients, 65 (43.9%) were considered as patients with PH. These presented with higher NYHA class at baseline (p = 0.027) and had more frequently a history of previous stroke/transient ischemic attack (p = 0.019). A difference in all-cause mortality was noted at 12 months [PH (-) vs. PH (+): 9.6 vs. 21.5%; p = 0.043]; however, it was no longer significant after adjustment for age and gender (OR 2.39, 95% CI 0.91-6.24; p = 0.08). Unadjusted and adjusted rates of all-cause death at maximal follow-up of 13.3 (6.0-31.1) months were higher in patients with PH. However, the presence of PH was not identified as an independent predictor of all-cause mortality at follow-up. No difference in other complications rates and QoL were noted. The presence of TRV >3.4 m/s indicating "high" probability of PH may predict impaired clinical outcomes after TAVI. No impact of PH on QoL outcomes was confirmed.
