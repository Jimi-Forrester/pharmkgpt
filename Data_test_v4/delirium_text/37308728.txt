37308728|t|Rapid Versus Gradual Weaning of External Ventricular Drain: A Systematic Literature Review and Meta-analysis.
37308728|a|The insertion of an external ventricular drain (EVD) is one of the most common neurosurgical procedures. Whether the weaning method (gradual or rapid) influences the ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) insertion rate has not been conclusively established. The aim of this study is to provide a systematic literature review and conduct a meta-analysis of studies comparing gradual with rapid EVD weaning regarding VPS insertion rate. Articles were identified by searching the Pubmed/Medline, Embase, and Web of Science databases throughout October 2022. Two independent researchers assessed the studies for inclusion and quality. We included randomized trials, prospective cohort studies, and retrospective cohort studies, which compared gradual and rapid EVD weaning. The primary outcome was VPS insertion rate, whereas secondary outcomes were EVD-associated infection (EVDAI) rate and length of stay in the hospital and intensive care unit (ICU). Four studies directly comparing rapid versus gradual EVD weaning, with 1337 patients suffering from subarachnoid hemorrhage, were identified and included in the meta-analysis. VPS insertion rate was 28.1% and 32.1% in patients with gradual and rapid EVD weaning, respectively (relative risk 0.85, 95% confidence interval 0.49-1.46, p = 0.56). Further, the EVDAI rate was comparable between the groups (gradual group 11.2%, rapid group 11.5%, relative risk 0.67, 95% confidence interval 0.24-1.89, p = 0.45), whereas length of stay in the ICU and hospital were significantly shorter in the rapid weaning group (2.7 and 3.6 days, respectively; p < 0.01). Rapid EVD weaning seems comparable to gradual EVD weaning concerning VPS insertion rates and EVDAI, whereas hospital and ICU length of stay is significantly reduced.
