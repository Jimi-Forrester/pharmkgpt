34079285|t|LINC00894 Enhances the Progression of Breast Cancer by Sponging miR-429 to Regulate ZEB1 Expression.
34079285|a|PURPOSE: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are known to regulate tumorigenesis. Although breast cancer tissues show a high expression of LINC00894, its specific biological role in breast cancer progression is still unknown. In this study, lncRNA microarray was used to analyze the lncRNA expression in breast cancer tissues, and LINC00894 was selected for further analysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Expression of LINC00894 in 45 pairs of breast cancer tissues and normal tissues obtained from patients with breast cancer was assessed by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR, while proliferation and invasion of breast cancer cells were assessed using a Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), EdU assay, colony formation experiment, and transwell assays. A dual-luciferase reporter gene assay and bioinformatics analysis were employed to detect potential targets of LINC00894. Additionally, RNA Binding Protein Immunoprecipitation (RIP) and Western blot assays were utilized to clarify its interaction and roles in the regulation of breast cancer progression. RESULTS: High expression of LINC00894 was observed in breast cancer cells, and its overexpression significantly expedited cell proliferation and invasion. Moreover, LINC00894 positively regulated the expression of ZEB1 by competitively binding to miR-429. CONCLUSION: Taken together, these results suggest that LINC00894 competitively binds to miR-429 to mediate ZEB1 expression; consequently, it is implicated to play a role in the progression of breast cancer.
