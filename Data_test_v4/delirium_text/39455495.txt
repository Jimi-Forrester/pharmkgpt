39455495|a|BACKGROUND: Ciprofol was approved for use in intensive care unit (ICU) patients requiring sedation during mechanical ventilation in July 2022. A pooled post-hoc analysis of phase 2 and phase 3 trials was conducted primarily to explore hypotension-free outcome in ICU patients who required mechanical ventilation and achieved the target light sedation goal at an early stage after being sedated with ciprofol or propofol. METHODS: All eligible ICU patients who were expected to require sedation for 6-24 h were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to either a ciprofol or propofol group. Ciprofol or propofol was initially infused at loading doses of 0.5 or 1.0 mg/kg followed by maintenance doses of 0.3 or 1.5 mg/kg/h. Ciprofol or propofol dosages were adjusted up or down at rates of 0.05-0.10 mg/kg/h or 0.25-0.50 mg/kg/h, respectively, to achieve the target light sedation (a Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale of -2 to + 1). The primary post-hoc outcome was the hypotension-free rate in patients who had achieved the target sedation goal after 30-min administration of ciprofol or propofol. RESULTS: In total, 174 patients were enrolled for pooled post-hoc analysis, of whom 116 and 58 were assigned to the ciprofol and propofol groups, respectively. The hypotension-free rate was significantly higher in patients who achieved the target sedation goal after 30-min administration of ciprofol (93.0% vs. 81.0%, P = 0.018), and especially in the subgroups of males and patients aged < 65 years. Multivariable analysis revealed that ciprofol treatment, a younger age and lower baseline body mass index were independent favorable predictors for a higher hypotension-free rate in patients who achieved the target sedation goal after 30-min of drug administration. Moreover, hypotension-free patients who reached the target sedation level after 30 min had a more favorable short-term prognosis including a lower incidence of drug-related treatment-emergent adverse events, shorter time to extubation and fewer dose adjustments of ciprofol or propofol (all P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: ICU patients undergoing mechanical ventilation and sedated with ciprofol had significantly lower rate of hypotension during the early phase of achieving light sedation during a 6-24 h period, leading to a more favorable short-term prognosis (within 24 h).
