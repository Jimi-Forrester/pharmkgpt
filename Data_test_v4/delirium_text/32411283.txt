32411283|t|An Assessment of the Relationship between Structural and Functional Imaging of Cerebrovascular Disease and Cognition-Related Fibers.
32411283|a|In order to assess the relationship between structural and functional imaging of cerebrovascular disease and cognition-related fibers, this paper chooses a total of 120 patients who underwent cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) treatment at a designated hospital by this study from June 2013 to June 2018 and divides them into 3 groups according to the random number table method: vascular dementia (VaD) group, vascular cognitive impairment no dementia (VCIND) group, and noncognition impairment (NCI) group with 40 cases of patients in each group. Cognitive function measurement and imaging examination were performed for these 3 groups of patients, and the observation indicators of cognitive state examination (CSE), mental assessment scale (MAS), clock drawing test (CDT), adult intelligence scale (AIS), frontal assessment battery (FAB), verbal fluency test (VFT), trail making test (TMT), cognitive index (CI), white matter lesions (WML), third ventricle width (TVW), and frontal horn index (FHI) were tested, respectively. The results shows that the average scores of CSE, MAS, AIS, and VFT in the VaD and VCIND group are lower than those of the NCI group and the differences are statistically significant (P < 0.05); the average scores of FAB, TMT, and CI in the VaD group are higher than those of the VCIND group and the differences are also statistically significant (P < 0.05); the average scores of FHI and TVW in the VaD group are lower than those of the VCIND and NCI group with statistically significant differences (P < 0.05); the average scores of WML, CDT, and AIS in the VaD group are higher than those of the VCIND and NCI group with statistically significant differences (P < 0.05). Therefore, it is believed that the structural and functional imaging features of cerebrovascular disease are closely related to cognition-related fibers, and the incidence of white matter lesions is closely related to the degree of lesions and cognitive dysfunction of cerebral small vessel disease, in which a major risk factor for cognitive dysfunction in patients with small blood vessels is the severity of white matter lesions; brain imaging and neuropsychiatric function assessment can better understand the relationship between cerebrovascular disease and cognitive impairment. The results of this study provide a reference for the further research studies on the relationship between structural and functional imaging of cerebrovascular disease and cognition-related fibers.
