37796401|a|Anxiety manifestations and cognitive dysfunction are common sequelae in patients with sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE). Microglia-mediated inflammatory signaling is involved in anxiety, depression, and cognitive dysfunction during acute infection with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying microglia activation and behavioral and cognitive deficits in sepsis have not been in fully elucidated. Based on previous research, we speculated that the CD137 receptor/ligand system modulates microglia function during sepsis to mediate classical neurological SAE symptoms. A murine model of SAE was established by injecting male C57BL/6 mice with LPS, and cultured mouse BV2 microglia were used for in vitro assays. RT-qPCR, immunofluorescence staining, flow cytometry, and ELISA were used to assess microglial activation and the expression of CD137L and inflammation-related cytokines in the mouse hippocampus and in cultured BV2 cells. In addition, behavioral tests were conducted in assess cognitive performance and behavioral distress. Immunofluorescence and RT-qPCR analyses showed that hippocampal expression of CD137L was upregulated in activated microglia following LPS treatment. Pre-treatment with the CD137L neutralizing antibody TKS-1 significantly reduced CD137L levels, attenuated the expression of M1 polarization markers in microglia, and inhibited the production of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6 in both LPS-treated mice and BV2 cells. Conversely, stimulation of CD137L signaling by recombinant CD137-Fc fusion protein activated the synthesis and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines in cultures BV2 microglia. Importantly, open field, elevated plus maze, and Y-maze spontaneous alternation test results indicated that TKS-1 administration alleviated anxiety-like behavior and spatial memory decline in mice with LPS-induced SAE. These findings suggest that CD137L upregulation in activated microglia critically contributes to neuroinflammation, anxiety-like behavior, and cognitive dysfunction in the mouse model of LPS-induced sepsis. Therefore, therapeutic modulation of the CD137L/CD137 signaling pathway may represent an effective way to minimize brain damage and prevent cognitive and emotional deficits associated with SAE.
