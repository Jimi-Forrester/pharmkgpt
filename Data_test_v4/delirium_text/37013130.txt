37013130|t|Frailty and Cancer: Current Perspectives on Assessment and Monitoring.
37013130|a|Frailty, an age-related condition of increased vulnerability to acute endogenous or exogenous stressors, is a key barrier to successful treatment of cancer in older people. In this group of patients, assessment of frailty is required before starting a new treatment. According to guidelines, the gold standard to assess frailty in older adults with cancer is geriatric screening followed by geriatric assessment (GA) across essential GA-domains (social status, physical function, nutrition, cognition, emotion, co-morbidity, polypharmacy). GA enables tailoring of both oncological therapy and non-oncological interventions to the patient's vulnerabilities. Large clinical trials recently have demonstrated that the feasibility and tolerability of systemic cancer treatment in older patients are significantly improved by such GA-guided management. Indications and optimal tools for frailty monitoring during the course of cancer treatment have not yet been defined in greater detail. New technologies such as wearable sensors or apps offer promising new opportunities to further develop frailty monitoring. This review describes the current standards and perspectives for the assessment and monitoring of frailty in elderly patients with cancer.
