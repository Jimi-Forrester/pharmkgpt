35841240|t|The Future of AD Clinical Trials with the Advent of Anti-Amyloid Therapies: An CTAD Task Force Report.
35841240|a|BACKGROUND: Aducanumab (ADUHELMTM) was approved for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in the US. This approval was supported by an effect on the cerebral amyloid plaque load and evidence of cognitive efficacy to be confirmed in post-marketing trials. Other anti-amyloid antibodies are under investigation in phase III (donanemab, lecanemab, gantenerumab) and have shown preliminary evidence of a cognitive benefit in phase II trials. Although these agents target a small segment of patients with mild cognitive impairment due to AD or mild AD dementia, their advent will change the design of future clinical trials both for anti-amyloid and non-amyloid drugs. These changes will promote the selection of patients in clinical trials by amyloid and tau biomarkers that identify patients with appropriate biology and may follow the treatment response to approved amyloid antibodies. The use of these agents creates the opportunity to test combined drug therapies and to conduct comparative assessments with innovative therapies and newly approved drugs available in clinical practice. Blood-based AD biomarkers should be implemented in research and could facilitate the recruitment into clinical trials. Anti-amyloid antibodies will have positive (e.g., more early diagnosis) and negative impacts (some subjects will be reluctant to participate in trials and risk assignment to placebo) on AD trials in the immediate future. We present the results of the CTAD Task Force on this topic, in Boston, November 6, 2021.
