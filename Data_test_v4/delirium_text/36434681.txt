36434681|t|Time progression and regional expression of brain oxidative stress induced by obstructive jaundice in rats.
36434681|a|BACKGROUND: Obstructive jaundice induces oxidative changes in the brain parenchyma and plays significant role in clinical manifestations of hepatic encephalopathy. We aim to study the progression of the brain oxidative status over time and the differences of its pattern over the hemispheres, the brainstem and the cerebellum. We use an experimental model in rats and measuring the oxidative stress (OS) specific biomarkers protein malondialdehyde (PrMDA) and protein carbonyls (PrC = O). RESULTS: Hyperbilirubinemia has been confirmed in all study groups as the result of common bile duct obstruction. We confirmed increase in both PrMDA and PrC = O biomarkers levels with different type of changes over time. We also confirmed that the oxidative process develops differently in each of the brain areas in study. CONCLUSIONS: The present study confirms the progressive increase in OS in all brain areas studied using markers indicative of cumulative protein modification.
