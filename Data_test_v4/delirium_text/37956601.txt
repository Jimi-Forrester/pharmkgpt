37956601|t|Development and evaluation of a concise nurse-driven non-pharmacological delirium reduction workflow for hospitalized patients: An interrupted time series study.
37956601|a|We created a concise nurse-driven delirium reduction workflow with the aim of reducing delirium rates and length of stay for hospitalized adults. Our nurse-driven workflow included five evidence-based daytime "sunrise" interventions (patient room lights on, blinds up, mobilization/out-of-bed, water within patient's reach and patient awake) and five nighttime "turndown" interventions (patient room lights off, blinds down, television off, noise reduction and pre-set bedtime). Interventions were also chosen because fidelity could be quickly monitored twice daily without patient interruption from outside the room. To evaluate the workflow, we used an interrupted time series study design between 06/01/17 and 05/30/22 to determine if the workflow significantly reduced the unit's delirium rate and average length of stay. Our workflow is feasible to implement and monitor and initially significantly reduced delirium rates but not length of stay. However, the reduction in delirium rates were not sustained following the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic.
