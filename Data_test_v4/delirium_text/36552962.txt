36552962|t|Tissue Characteristics of Endometrial Carcinoma Analyzed by Quantitative Synthetic MRI and Diffusion-Weighted Imaging.
36552962|a|BACKGROUND: This study investigates the association of T1, T2, proton density (PD) and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) with histopathologic features of endometrial carcinoma (EC). METHODS: One hundred and nine EC patients were prospectively enrolled from August 2019 to December 2020. Synthetic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was acquired through one acquisition, in addition to diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and other conventional sequences using 1.5T MRI. T1, T2, PD derived from synthetic MRI and ADC derived from DWI were compared among different histopathologic features, namely the depth of myometrial invasion (MI), tumor grade, cervical stromal invasion (CSI) and lymphovascular invasion (LVSI) of EC by the Mann-Whitney U test. Classification models based on the significant MRI metrics were constructed with their respective receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, and their micro-averaged ROC was used to evaluate the overall performance of these significant MRI metrics in determining aggressive histopathologic features of EC. RESULTS: EC with MI had significantly lower T2, PD and ADC than those without MI (p = 0.007, 0.006 and 0.043, respectively). Grade 2-3 EC and EC with LVSI had significantly lower ADC than grade 1 EC and EC without LVSI, respectively (p = 0.005, p = 0.020). There were no differences in the MRI metrics in EC with or without CSI. Micro-averaged ROC of the three models had an area under the curve of 0.83. CONCLUSIONS: Synthetic MRI provided quantitative metrics to characterize EC with one single acquisition. Low T2, PD and ADC were associated with aggressive histopathologic features of EC, offering excellent performance in determining aggressive histopathologic features of EC.
