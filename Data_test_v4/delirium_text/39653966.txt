39653966|a|INTRODUCTION: Memory impairment is a critical challenge in neurodegenerative disorders, particularly in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and age-related cognitive decline. This research explores the molecular mechanisms by which curcumin, a polyphenolic compound derived from Curcuma longa, exerts neuroprotective effects that may ameliorate cognitive deficits associated with these conditions. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Evidence from both preclinical studies and emerging clinical trials indicates that curcumin enhances neuronal signaling and synaptic plasticity, primarily through the modulation of pathways such as NF-kappaB and PI3K/Akt. Specifically, curcumin has been shown to reduce neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, thereby promoting synaptic integrity and function. For instance, studies demonstrate that curcumin treatment increases the density of dendritic spines in the hippocampus, which correlates with improved spatial learning and memory performance in animal models. Despite promising findings, significant gaps remain in our understanding of curcumin's efficacy in humans. Most existing research is derived from animal studies, with limited large-scale clinical trials to substantiate its therapeutic potential. Furthermore, challenges such as curcumin's low bioavailability and inconsistencies in dosing complicate its clinical application. This review underscores the need for future research focused on enhancing curcumin's bioavailability, establishing optimal dosages, and conducting comprehensive human trials to validate its effectiveness. By addressing these issues, we aim to clarify curcumin's role as a potential therapeutic agent for memory impairment in neurodegenerative disorders, paving the way for innovative treatment strategies.
