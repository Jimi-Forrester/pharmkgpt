32261713|a|The aggregation of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) has been linked to the formation of neuritic plaques, which are pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. We synthesized peptides containing fluorinated amino acids and studied their effect on the Abeta aggregation. The peptides were based on the sequence LVFFD, in which valine was substituted by either 4,4,4-trifluorovaline or 4-fluoroproline, or the phenylalanine at position 3 was replaced by 3,4,5-trifluorophenylalanine. Our results demonstrate that fluorination of the hydrophobic residue valine or phenylalanine is effective in preventing the Abeta aggregation. This study opens up the possibility of using new sequences based on fluorinated amino acids to inhibit the amyloid-fibril formation.
