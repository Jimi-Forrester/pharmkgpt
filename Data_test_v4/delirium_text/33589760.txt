33589760|a|We investigated ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring (ABPM) profiles and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of cerebral small-vessel disease (cSVD) in older adults with cognitive complaints who were grouped as follows: subjective cognitive decline, mild cognitive impairment, and dementia of Alzheimer's type. Group comparisons and correlation analyses among demographic characteristics, cognitive and MRI findings, and ABPM profiles were performed. Furthermore, multivariate logistic regression analyses for dependent variables of (1) dementia or not and (2) MRI criteria of subcortical vascular dementia (SVaD) or not were conducted with independent variables of dichotomized ABPM profiles. A total of 174 subjects (55 males and 119 females) were included: mean age 75.36 +- 7.13 years; Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score 20.51 +- 6.23. No MRI and ABPM findings except medial temporal atrophy were different between three groups. Twenty-four-hour systolic BP (sBP) was correlated with MMSE score (r = -0.182; p = 0.022) and the severity of white matter hyperintensity (WMH) (r = 0.157; p = 0.048). A higher daytime sBP was associated with dementia (odds ratio (OR): 3.734; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.041-13.390; p = 0.043) and MRI finding of SVaD (OR: 10.543; 95% CI: 1.161-95.740; p = 0.036). Although there were no differences in ABPM profiles between three groups, a higher BP-especially a higher sBP-correlated with cognitive dysfunction and severity of WMH in older adults. Only higher daytime sBP was an independent predictor for dementia and MRI findings of SVaD. Among various ABPM profiles in this study, a higher BP, especially a higher sBP, may be considered the most important for clinical and MRI findings of cSVD.
