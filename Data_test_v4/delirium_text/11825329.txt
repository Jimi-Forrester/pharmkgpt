11825329|a|There are currently four compounds approved for use in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). These drugs are all cholinesterase (ChE) inhibitors, which are thought to provide predominantly symptomatic benefits by increasing the level of acetylcholine (ACh) in the synapse. Although there are slight differences in the mechanisms of action of these compounds, it remains to be determined whether any one of them has a significant therapeutic advantage over the others. Several other drugs have also been investigated for their potential use as either symptomatic or disease-modifying agents in the treatment of AD, with mixed results. Current therapeutic research is focused on addressing the underlying pathology of AD, in the hope of arresting or reversing the course of the disease. This review will provide an overview of the ChE inhibitors and other drugs used for treating the symptoms of AD, summarise the results of recent therapeutic trials, discuss directions of future research and outline the current treatment recommendations for AD.
