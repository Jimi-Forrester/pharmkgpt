1266494|t|[Assessment of the effectiveness of hemodes in the treatment of the febrile variant of delirium tremens].
1266494|a|The authors propose a complex scheme in the treatment of a febrile variant of delirium tremens. The main emphasis is made on the use of hemodez possessing an antitoxic property and normalizing metabolism. The use of the mentioned preparation along with neuroleptics and symptomatical therapy as was tried in 30 patients with delirium tremens, permitted to arrest acute disorders, the hyperthermic syndrome and normalize the vital functions of the organism. These measures excluded unfavourable lethal outcomes even in cases complicated by Gayet-Wernicke encephalopathy.
