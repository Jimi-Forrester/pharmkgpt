36977093|t|Differential Role of Active Compounds in Mitophagy and Related Neurodegenerative Diseases.
36977093|a|Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's disease, significantly reduce the quality of life of patients and eventually result in complete maladjustment. Disruption of the synapses leads to a deterioration in the communication of nerve cells and decreased plasticity, which is associated with a loss of cognitive functions and neurodegeneration. Maintaining proper synaptic activity depends on the qualitative composition of mitochondria, because synaptic processes require sufficient energy supply and fine calcium regulation. The maintenance of the qualitative composition of mitochondria occurs due to mitophagy. The regulation of mitophagy is usually based on several internal mechanisms, as well as on signals and substances coming from outside the cell. These substances may directly or indirectly enhance or weaken mitophagy. In this review, we have considered the role of some compounds in process of mitophagy and neurodegeneration. Some of them have a beneficial effect on the functions of mitochondria and enhance mitophagy, showing promise as novel drugs for the treatment of neurodegenerative pathologies, while others contribute to a decrease in mitophagy.
