24279195|a|While the most common dementia is Alzheimer disease (AD), a detailed history is needed to rule out rapidly progressive dementias (RPDs). RPDs are less than two years in duration and have a rate of progression faster typical neurodegenerative diseases. Identification of RPDs is important as some are treatable. This review focuses on the spectrum of RPDs, with special emphasis on paraneoplastic disorders and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD).
