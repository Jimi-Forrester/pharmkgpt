37113785|a|Chemicals used for storage majorly possess insecticidal activities - deterring destructive insect pests and microorganisms from stored agricultural produce. Despite the controversy about their safety, local farmers and agro-wholesalers still predominantly use these chemicals in developing countries, especially Africa, to ensure an all-year supply of agriproducts. These chemicals could have short- or long-term effects. Despite the state-of-the-art knowledge, factors such as poor education and awareness, limited agricultural subventions, quests for cheap chemicals, over-dosage, and many more are the possible reasons for these toxic chemicals' setback and persistent use in developing countries. This paper provides an up-to-date review of the environmental and ecological effects, as well as the health impacts arising from the indiscriminate use of toxic chemicals in agriproducts. Existing data link pesticides to endocrine disruption, genetic mutations, neurological dysfunction, and other metabolic disorders, apart from the myriad of acute effects. Finally, this study recommended several naturally sourced preservatives as viable alternatives to chemical counterparts and emphasized the invaluable role of education and awareness programs in mitigating the use in developing nations for a sustainable society.
