33466581|a|Although the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are amyloid beta plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, there is growing evidence that neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress play important roles in disease development and progression. A major risk factor for the development of AD is diabetes, which is also characterized by oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction along with chronic, low-grade inflammation. Increasing evidence indicates that in immune cells, the induction of a pro-inflammatory phenotype is associated with a shift from oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) to glycolysis. However, whether hyperglycemia also contributes to this shift is not clear. Several different approaches including culturing BV2 microglial cells in different carbon sources, using enzyme inhibitors and knocking down key pathway elements were used in conjunction with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) activation to address this question. The results indicate that while high glucose favors NO production, pro-inflammatory cytokine production is highest in the presence of carbon sources that drive OXPHOS. In addition, among the carbon sources that drive OXPHOS, glutamine is a very potent inducer of IL6 production. This effect is dampened in the presence of glucose. Together, these results may provide new prospects for the therapeutic manipulation of neuroinflammation in the context of diabetes and AD.
