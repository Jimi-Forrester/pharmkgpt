35216103|a|An increasing number of people experience disorders related to the central nervous system (CNS). Thus, new forms of therapy, which may be helpful in repairing processes' enhancement and restoring declined brain functions, are constantly being sought. One of the most relevant physiological processes occurring in the brain for its entire life is neuroplasticity. It has tremendous significance concerning CNS disorders since neurological recovery mainly depends on restoring its structural and functional organization. The main factors contributing to nerve tissue damage are oxidative stress and inflammation. Hence, marine carotenoids, abundantly occurring in the aquatic environment, being potent antioxidant compounds, may play a pivotal role in nerve cell protection. Furthermore, recent results revealed another valuable characteristic of these compounds in CNS therapy. By inhibiting oxidative stress and neuroinflammation, carotenoids promote synaptogenesis and neurogenesis, consequently presenting neuroprotective activity. Therefore, this paper focuses on the carotenoids obtained from marine sources and their impact on neuroplasticity enhancement.
