37940760|a|Neurodegenerative disorders are characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction and subsequently oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis that contribute to neuronal cytotoxicity and degeneration. Huntington's (HD), Alzheimer's (AD), and Parkinson's (PD) diseases are three of the major neurodegenerative diseases. To date, researchers have found various natural phytochemicals that could potentially be used to treat neurodegenerative diseases. Particularly, the application of natural phenolic compounds has gained significant traction in recent years, driven by their various biological activities and therapeutic efficacy in human health. Polyphenols, by modulating different cellular functions, play an important role in neuroprotection and can neutralize the effects of oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis in animal models. This review focuses on the current state of knowledge on phenolic compounds, including phenolic acids, flavonoids, stilbenes, and coumarins, as well as their beneficial effects on human health. We further provide an overview of the therapeutic potential and mechanisms of action of natural dietary phenolics in curing neurodegenerative diseases in animal models.
