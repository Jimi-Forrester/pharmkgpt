38152069|t|Diabetes and diabesity in the view of proteomics, drug, and plant-derived remedies.
38152069|a|Diabetes and obesity are highly prevalent in the world. Proteomics is a promising approach to better understanding enzymes, proteins, and signaling molecules involved in diabetes processes which help recognize the basis of the disease better and find suitable new treatments. This study aimed to summarize the molecular mechanisms from the beginning of insulin secretion in response to stimuli to the pathology of the insulin signaling pathway and, finally, the mechanisms of drugs/chemicals remedies that affect this process. The titles and subtitles of this process were determined, and then for each of them, the articles searched in PubMed and ScienceDirect were used. This review article starts the discussion with the molecular basis of insulin biosynthesis, secretion, insulin's mechanism of action, and molecular aspect of diabetes and diabesity (a new term showing the relation between diabetes and obesity) and ends with the drug and plant-derived intervention for hyperglycemia.
