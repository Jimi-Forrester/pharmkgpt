35518507|t|Development of a HPLC-FL method to determine benzaldehyde after derivatization with N-acetylhydrazine acridone and its application for determination of semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase activity in human serum.
35518507|a|A novel fluorescence labeling reagent N-acetylhydrazine acridone (AHAD) was designed and synthesized. A highly sensitive high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method coupled with fluorescence detection to determine benzaldehyde after derivatization with AHAD was developed. Optimum derivatization was obtained at 40  C for 30 min with trichloroacetic acid as catalyst. Benzaldehyde derivative was separated on a reversed-phase SB-C18 column in conjunction with a gradient elution and detected by fluorescence detection at excitation and emission wavelengths of 371 nm and 421 nm. The established method exhibited excellent linearity over the injected amount of benzaldehyde of 0.003 to 5 nmol mL-1. The method was successfully applied to the determination of serum semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase (SSAO) activity in humans. SSAO is a significant biomarker because serum SSAO activity is elevated in patients with Alzheimer's disease, vascular disorders, heart disease and diabetes mellitus. It was demonstrated that the SSAO activity of the hyperglycemic group (60 +- 4 nmol mL-1 h-1) was significantly higher than that of normal blood sugar group (44 +- 4 nmol mL-1 h-1) with P < 0.05.
