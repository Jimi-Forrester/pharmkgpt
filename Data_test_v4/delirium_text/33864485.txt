33864485|a|Extubation failure (EF) following neonatal cardiac surgery is associated with increased mortality. Neonates who experienced EF twice or more (recurrent EF) may have worse outcomes than those who have a single EF or no-EF. The aims of this study are to investigate the in hospital mortality for neonates with recurrent EF compared to those with single or no-EF, and determine factors associated with recurrent EF. Neonates' <= 28 days who underwent cardiac surgery from January 2008 to December 2019 were included. EF was defined as unplanned reintubation within 72 h after a planned extubation. 1187 (18 recurrent EF, 84 single EF and 1085 no-EF) neonates were included. Recurrent EF occurred in 18 (17.6%) of 102 neonates undergoing a second extubation. The median time (IQR) to reintubation after the first and second extubations were similar, being 20.9 (3.3-45.2) versus 19.4 (5.5-47) h. The reason for a second-time EF was respiratory in 39% and cardiovascular in 33%. Recurrent EF and single EF was associated with increased mortality (odds ratio, 95% confidence interval (CI) 23.5, 6.9-79.9) and (odds ratio, 95% CI 5.2, 2.3-12.0) compared to no-EF. Based on the final model with risk adjustment, predicted mortality was 29.0% in recurrent EF, 6.5% in single EF, and 1.2% in no-EF. First-time EF due to cardiovascular compromise was associated with recurrent EF (odds ratio, 95% CI 3.1, 1.0-9.7). This study confirmed that patients with recurrent EF have a high morality. Neonates with a cardiovascular reason for first-time EF are more likely to have a recurrent EF than those with other causes.
