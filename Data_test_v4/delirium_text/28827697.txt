28827697|a|The impact of dynapenia on the complexity of care for residents of long-term care facilities (LTCF) remains unclear. The present study evaluated associations between dynapenia, care problems and care complexity in 504 residents of Veterans Care Homes (VCHs) in Taiwan. Subjects with dynapenia, defined as low muscle strength (handgrip strength <26 kg), were older adults with lower body mass index (BMI), slow gait speed, and higher numbers of Resident Assessment Protocol (RAP) triggers. After adjusting for age, education, BMI, and Charlson's comorbidity index (CCI), only age, education, BMI and gait speed were independently associated with higher numbers of RAP triggers, but not dynapenia or handgrip strength (kg). Dividing subjects into groups based on quartiles of gait speed, those with gait speed <=0.803 m/s were significantly associated with higher complexity of care needs (defined as >=4 RAP triggers) compared to the reference group (gait speed >1 m/s). Significantly slow gait speed was associated with RAP triggers, including cognitive loss, poor communication ability, rehabilitation needs, urinary incontinence, depressed mood, falls, pressure ulcers, and use of psychotropic drugs. In conclusion, slow gait speed rather than dynapenia is a simple indicator for higher complexity of care needs of older male LTCF residents.
