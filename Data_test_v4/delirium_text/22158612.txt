22158612|a|Regenerating islet-derived 1alpha (Reg-1alpha)/lithostathine, a member of a family of secreted proteins containing a C-type lectin domain, is expressed in various organs and plays a role in proliferation, differentiation, inflammation, and carcinogenesis of cells of the digestive system. We previously reported that Reg-1alpha is overexpressed during the very early stages of Alzheimer disease, and Reg-1alpha deposits were detected in the brain of patients with Alzheimer disease. However, the physiological function of Reg-1alpha in neural cells remains unknown. Here, we show that Reg-1alpha is expressed in neuronal cell lines (PC12 and Neuro-2a) and in rat primary hippocampal neurons (E17.5). Reg-1alpha is mainly localized around the nucleus and at the membrane of cell bodies and neurites. Transient overexpression of Reg-1alpha or addition of recombinant Reg-1alpha significantly increases the number of cells with longer neurites by stimulating neurite outgrowth. These effects are abolished upon down-regulation of Reg-1alpha by siRNA and following inhibition of secreted Reg-1alpha by antibodies. Moreover, Reg-1alpha colocalizes with exostosin tumor-like 3 (EXTL3), its putative receptor, at the membrane of these cells. Overexpression of EXTL3 increases the effect of recombinant Reg-1alpha on neurite outgrowth, and Reg-1alpha is not effective when EXTL3 overexpression is down-regulated by shRNA. Our findings indicate that Reg-1alpha regulates neurite outgrowth and suggest that this effect is mediated by its receptor EXTL3.
