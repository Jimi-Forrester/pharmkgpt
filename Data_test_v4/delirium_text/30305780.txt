30305780|a|Overactive bladder (OAB) syndrome is highly prevalent in both men and women and might have negative impact on quality of life. Clinical trials of OAB usually highly select participants that may not reflect the real-world practice of OAB patients. The spectrum of OAB includes patients with idiopathic, neuropathic, with bladder outlet obstruction, and patients in elderly and medical comorbidities. Patients might have poor response to OAB medication or have adverse events after treatment. Therefore, treatment of OAB should be individualized to obtain therapeutic efficacy and avoid unacceptable adverse events. This article reviews the recently published literature and provides a guide for physicians to choose the appropriate treatment for different OAB patients.
