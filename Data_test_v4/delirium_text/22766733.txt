22766733|a|Reduced levels of naturally occurring autoantibodies against amyloid-beta (Abeta) have been described in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Lifetime depression doubles the risk of AD, thus these autoantibodies may also be reduced in this group. We measured serum IgG autoantibody titers against Abeta1-42, S100b and alpha-synuclein in 214 individuals with depression and 419 controls. Titers against Abeta1-42 were lower in individuals with lifetime depression (5544.6 +- 389.3) compared to controls (7208.7 +- 482.4; p = 0.048). Titers against S100b and alpha-synuclein were comparable between the cohorts. These data suggest an AD-like impairment of the humoral immune response in a relevant proportion of individuals with depression.
