36652916|t|Antiviral immunity rewired for axon regeneration.
36652916|a|In Neuron's January 18th issue, Wang et al.1 report that activating the immune signaling IFNgamma-cGAS-STING axis promotes axon regeneration in both the peripheral and central nervous systems. Their findings uncover the coordination mechanism of neural innate immune responses for axon regeneration.
