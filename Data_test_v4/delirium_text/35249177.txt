35249177|a|3-Nitropropionic acid (3-NP) model serves as a beneficial tool to evaluate the effect of novel treatments for Huntington's disease (HD). The aim of the present study was to demonstrate the neuroprotective effect of recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO) and interferon-beta-1b (IFN-beta-1b) in 3-NP-induced neurotoxicity in rats. Rats were injected with 3-NP (10 mg/kg/day, i.p) for 2 weeks and were divided into five subgroups; the first served as the HD group, the second received rhEPO (5000 IU/kg/every other day, i.p.) for 2 weeks, the third received rhEPO starting from the 5th day of 3-NP injection, the fourth received IFN-beta-1b (300,000 units, every day other day, s.c) for 2 weeks, and the last received IFN-beta-1b starting from the 5th day of 3-NP injection. All treatments significantly improved motor and behavior performance of rats. Moreover, all treatments markedly restored mitochondrial function as well as brain-derived neurotrophic factor level, and reduced oxidative stress biomarkers, pro-inflammatory mediators, nuclear factor kappa B expression, caspase-3, and Bax/Bcl2 ratio in the striatum. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates the neuroprotective potential of rhEPO or IFN-beta-1b on 3-NP-induced neurotoxicity in rats. Furthermore, our study suggests that activation of JAK2/STAT3 or JAK1/STAT3 may contribute to the neuroprotective activity of rhEPO or IFN-beta-1b, respectively. We also found that early treatment with rhEPO did not confer any benefits compared with late rhEPO treatment, while early IFN-beta-1b showed a marked significant benefit compared with late IFN-beta-1b.
