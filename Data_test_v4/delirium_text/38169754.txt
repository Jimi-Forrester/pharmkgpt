38169754|t|Exploring the Neuroprotective Effects of Lithium in Ischemic Stroke: A literature review.
38169754|a|Ischemic stroke ranks among the foremost clinical causes of mortality and disability, instigating neuronal degeneration, fatalities, and various sequelae. While standard treatments, such as intravenous thrombolysis and endovascular thrombectomy, prove effective, they come with limitations. Hence, there is a compelling need to develop neuroprotective agents capable of improving the functional outcomes of the nervous system. Numerous preclinical studies have demonstrated that lithium can act in multiple molecular pathways, including glycogen synthase kinase 3(GSK-3), the Wnt signaling pathway, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/ extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and glutamate receptors. Through these pathways, lithium has been shown to affect inflammation, autophagy, apoptosis, ferroptosis, excitotoxicity, and other pathological processes, thereby improving central nervous system (CNS) damage caused by ischemic stroke. Despite these promising preclinical findings, the number of clinical trials exploring lithium's efficacy remains limited. Additional trials are imperative to thoroughly ascertain the effectiveness and safety of lithium in clinical settings. This review delineates the mechanisms underpinning lithium's neuroprotective capabilities in the context of ischemic stroke. It elucidates the intricate interplay between these mechanisms and sheds light on the involvement of mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammatory markers in the pathophysiology of ischemic stroke. Furthermore, the review offers directions for future research, thereby advancing the understanding of the potential therapeutic utility of lithium and establishing a theoretical foundation for its clinical application.
