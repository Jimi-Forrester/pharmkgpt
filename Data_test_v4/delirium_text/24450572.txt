24450572|t|Unique effect of Cu(II) in the metal-induced amyloid formation of beta-2-microglobulin.
24450572|a|beta-2-Microglobulin (beta2m) forms amyloid fibrils in the joints of patients undergoing hemodialysis treatment as a result of kidney failure. In the presence of stoichiometric amounts of Cu(II), beta2m self-associates into discrete oligomeric species, including dimers, tetramers, and hexamers, before ultimately forming amyloid fibrils that contain no copper. To improve our understanding of whether Cu(II) is unique in its ability to induce beta2m amyloid formation and to delineate the coordinative interactions that allow Cu(II) to exert its effect, we have examined the binding of Ni(II) and Zn(II) to beta2m and the resulting influence that these metals have on beta2m aggregation. We find that, in contrast to Cu(II), Ni(II) does not induce the oligomerization or aggregation of beta2m, while Zn(II) promotes oligomerization but not amyloid fibril formation. Using X-ray absorption spectroscopy and new mass spectrometry-related techniques, we find that different binding modes are responsible for the different effects of Ni(II) and Zn(II). By comparing the binding modes of Cu(II) with Ni(II), we find that Cu(II) binding to Asp59 and the backbone amide between the first two residues of beta2m are important for allowing the formation of amyloid-competent oligomers, as Ni(II) appears not to bind these sites on the protein. The oligomers formed in the presence of Zn(II) are permitted by this metal's ability to bridge two beta2m units via His51. These oligomers, however, are not able to progress to form amyloid fibrils because Zn(II) does not induce the required structural changes near the N-terminus and His31.
