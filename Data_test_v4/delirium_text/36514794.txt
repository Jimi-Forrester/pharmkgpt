36514794|a|The number of pregnant women being admitted with severe COVID-19 infection and dying has increased with each wave of the pandemic. These women often present unique challenges to the medical and obstetric teams given the changes in physiology that occur in pregnancy, affecting assessment and management, as well as the practical difficulties such as the ideal location of care. Whilst the basis of treatment remains the same, there are nuances to caring for pregnant women that need considerable thought and multidisciplinary collaboration. Obstetricians, neonatologists, midwives, intensivists, anaesthetists and physicians may all be involved at some point, depending on the gestation and severity of illness. Implementing a COVID-19 in pregnancy guideline or checklist for your hospital will help ensure pregnant women are managed in a safe and timely manner. Here described are some key recommendations to help in the management of pregnant women admitted with COVID-19.
