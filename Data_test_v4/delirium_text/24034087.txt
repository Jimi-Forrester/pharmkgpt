24034087|t|A single-site retrospective study of pediatric arterial ischemic stroke etiology, clinical presentation, and radiologic features.
24034087|a|BACKGROUND: Stroke occurs upon obstruction of cerebral blood circulation and is clinically characterized by sudden onset symptoms. Advanced age is the main risk factor of stroke, but cases of pediatric stroke have been rarely reported. This study aimed to determine the etiology, clinical presentation, and radiologic features of neurological deficit for pediatric arterial ischemic stroke (PAIS). METHODS: The medical records of 42 PAIS patients (age range: 9 months to 13 years) treated at Wuhan Children's Hospital between July 2007 and January 2011 were retrospectively reviewed. Infarction location was first determined by craniocerebral computed tomography and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. The stenotic or occluded main cerebral arteries and/or branches were determined by MR angiography and digital subtraction angiography. RESULTS: The majority of the 42 PAIS cases (66.7%, n = 28) were <= 3 years old (vs. >3 years old: 33.3%, n = 14; P<0.05), but the male: female ratio was similar in both groups (P > 0.05). The most frequently reported signs and symptoms for both age groups were limited physical activity followed by convulsions and delirium, but convulsions were more prevalent in children <= 3 years-old. Children > 3 years-old mainly experienced the limited physical activity symptoms, including hemiparalysis, aphasia, and ataxia. For all 42 cases, the most frequent etiologies were infections (38.1%, n = 16), iron deficiency anemia (16.7%, n = 7), and moyamoya syndrome (11.9%, n = 5). The predominant infarcts among all cases were middle cerebral artery (63.6%, n = 21) and basal ganglia (64.3%, n = 27). CONCLUSIONS: PAIS occurs more frequently in younger children and this group most frequently presents with convulsion as the initial symptom. The overall etiologies of PAIS may be different from those of adult stroke and the involved regions may be distinguishing features of PAIS or its different forms, but more research is required.
