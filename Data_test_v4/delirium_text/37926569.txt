37926569|a|Objective: To investigate the relationship between intraoperative electroencephalogram burst suppression (BS) and emergence delirium (ED) in elderly patients undergoing elective laparoscopic surgery under total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA). Methods: From October 2017 to September 2019, a total of 358 elderly patients who underwent elective laparoscopic surgery under TIVA at Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, were included. Patients were divided into two groups based on the confusion assessment method for the intensive care unit (CAM-ICU) assessment conducted before leaving the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU): the ED group [n=63, 46 males, 17 females, average age of (70.8+-0.6) years] and the non-ED group [n=295, 220 males, 75 females, average age of (69.7+-0.2) years]. Preoperative general information, intraoperative conditions, and intraoperative electroencephalogram BS status were collected. A multivariate logistic regression model was employed to identify risk factors associated with ED. Results: In the ED group, the duration of surgery, intraoperative blood loss, the burst suppression ratio (BSR)>10% lasting for more than 1 minute were (224.4+-9.6) min, (240.8+-33.9) ml, 36.5% (23/63), respectively, which were higher than those of the non-ED group [(204.7+-3.6) min, (150.5+-9.2) ml, 21.7% (64/295), all P<0.05]. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that a longer duration of education was a protective factor for ED (OR=0.904, 95%CI: 0.833-0.982,P=0.016), whereas increased intraoperative blood loss (OR=1.002, 95%CI: 1.000-1.003, P=0.013) and BSR>10% lasting for more than 1 minute (OR=2.131, 95%CI: 1.004-4.524,P=0.049) were identified as risk factors for ED. Conclusion: In elderly patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery under TIVA, intraoperative electroencephalogram BS may be a risk factor for ED.
