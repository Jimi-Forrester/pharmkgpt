10521466|t|Presenilin 1 protein directly interacts with Bcl-2.
10521466|a|Presenilin proteins are involved in familial Alzheimer's disease, a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by massive death of neurons. We describe a direct interaction between presenilin 1 (PS1) and Bcl-2, a key factor in the regulation of apoptosis, by yeast two-hybrid interaction system, by co-immunoprecipitation, and by cross-linking experiments. Our data show that PS1 and Bcl-2 assemble into a macromolecular complex, and that they are released from this complex in response to an apoptotic stimulus induced by staurosporine. The results support the idea of cross-talk between these two proteins during apoptosis.
