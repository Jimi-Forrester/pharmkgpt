OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the therapeutic effect of proton stimulation (PS) targeting plaque magnetite in the transgenic AD mouse brain. METHODS: A proton transmission beam was applied to the whole mouse brain at a single entrance dose of 2 or 4 Gy to test the effect of disruption of magnetite-containing Abeta plaques by electron emission from magnetite. The reduction in Abeta plaque burden and the cognitive function of the PS-treated mouse group were assayed by histochemical analysis and memory tests, respectively. Abeta-magnetite and Abeta fibrils were treated with PS to investigate the breakdown of the amyloid protein matrix. RESULTS: Single PS induced a 48-87%reduction in both the amyloid plaque burden and ferrous-containing magnetite level in the early-onset AD mouse brain while saving normal tissue. The overall Abeta plaque burden (68-82%) and (94-97%) hippocampal magnetite levels were reduced in late onset AD mice that showed improvements in cognitive function after PS compared with untreated AD mice (p < 0.001). Analysis of amyloid fibrils after exposure to a single 2 or 4 Gy proton transmission beam demonstrated that the protein matrix was broken down only in magnetite-associated Abeta fibrils. CONCLUSION: Single PS targeting plaque magnetite effectively decreases the amyloid plaque burden and the ferrous-containing magnetite level, and this effect is useful for memory recovery.
