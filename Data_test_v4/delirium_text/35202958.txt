35202958|a|BACKGROUND: Astrocytes senescence has been demonstrated in the aging brain and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Moreover, lower glucose metabolism has been confirmed in the early stage of AD. However, whether low glucose could induce astrocytes senescence remain ambiguous. Studies have shown that the ethanol extracts of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi (SGE) exert neuroprotective and anti-aging effects, while whether SGE could delay astrocytes senescence was unclear. PURPOSE: This study investigated the anti-senescence effect of SGE in low glucose-induced T98G cells and primary astrocytes, and explored the possible mechanisms based on boolean network. METHODS: The neuroprotective effects of SGE in low glucose-induced T98G cells were evaluated by measurement of cell viability, LDH, ROS and ATP. The anti-senescence effects of SGE were investigated by detection of senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-beta-Gal), senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), cell cycle and senescence-related markers. The possible mechanisms of SGE in delaying astrocytes senescence were discovered through integrating transcriptomics with boolean network, and validation experiments were further performed. RESULTS: Our results revealed that low glucose could induce astrocytes senescence, and SGE could delay astrocytes senescence by decreasing the staining rate of SA-beta-gal, reducing secretions of SASP factors (IL-6, CXCL1, MMP-1), alleviating cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase, decreasing the formation of punctate DNA foci and down-regulating the expression of p16INK4A, p21 and gammaH2A.X. Transcriptomics and further verification results showed that SGE could markedly inhibit the mRNA expression levels of SASP factors (CXCL10, CXCL2, CCL2, IL-6, CXCR4, CCR7). Moreover, C-X-C motif chemokine 10 (CXCL10) was predicted to be the key SASP factor affecting the network stability by using boolean network. Further experiments validated that SGE could markedly reduce CXCL10 level, decrease the secretion of IL-6 and inhibit cell migration in CXCL10 induced primary astrocytes. CONCLUSION: In summary, our research unmasks that the anti-senescence effects of SGE were highly correlated with the suppression of SASP secretions, and CXCL10 mediated the SASP inhibition effect of SGE in low glucose-induced astrocytes. Our study highlights that the delay of astrocytes senescence and the inhibition of SASP might be a new mechanism of SGE for alleviating neurodegenerative diseases such as AD.
