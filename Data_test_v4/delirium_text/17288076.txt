17288076|t|Managing chronic conditions for elderly adults: the VNS CHOICE model.
17288076|a|Chronic illness combined with functional impairment often results in an increased need for medical care and supportive long-term care (LTC) services. Navigating the health care system is challenging and complex, and even more so for patients with complex needs. Traditional fee-for-service care does not support and facilitate coordination and collaboration between providers and service settings. In New York State, managed LTC, a model of coordinated care for the chronically ill, endeavors to provide a bridge between primary, acute, home and community-based, and institutional LTC services for a medically complex and functionally frail nursing home eligible population.
