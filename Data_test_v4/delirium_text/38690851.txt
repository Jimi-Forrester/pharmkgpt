38690851|t|Probing Protein Structural Changes in Alzheimer's Disease via Quantitative Cross-linking Mass Spectrometry.
38690851|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurological disorder featuring abnormal protein aggregation in the brain, including the pathological hallmarks of amyloid plaques and hyperphosphorylated tau. Despite extensive research efforts, understanding the molecular intricacies driving AD development remains a formidable challenge. This study focuses on identifying key protein conformational changes associated with the progression of AD. To achieve this, we employed quantitative cross-linking mass spectrometry (XL-MS) to elucidate conformational changes in the protein networks in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). By using isotopically labeled cross-linkers BS3d0 and BS3d4, we reveal a dynamic shift in protein interaction networks during AD progression. Our comprehensive analysis highlights distinct alterations in protein-protein interactions within mild cognitive impairment (MCI) states. This study accentuates the potential of cross-linked peptides as indicators of AD-related conformational changes, including previously unreported site-specific binding between alpha-1-antitrypsin (A1AT) and complement component 3 (CO3). Furthermore, this work enables detailed structural characterization of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) and reveals modifications within its helical domains, suggesting their involvement in MCI pathogenesis. The quantitative approach provides insights into site-specific interactions and changes in the abundance of cross-linked peptides, offering an improved understanding of the intricate protein-protein interactions underlying AD progression. These findings lay a foundation for the development of potential diagnostic or therapeutic strategies aimed at mitigating the negative impact of AD.
