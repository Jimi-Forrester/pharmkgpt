15867923|t|Phosphorylation-specific prolyl isomerization: is there an underlying theme?
15867923|a|The prolyl isomerase Pin1 is a conserved enzyme that is intimately involved in diverse biological processes and pathological conditions such as cancer and Alzheimer's disease. By catalysing cis-trans interconversion of certain motifs containing phosphorylated serine or threonine residues followed by a proline residue (pSer/Thr-Pro), Pin1 can have profound effects on phosphorylation signalling. The structural and functional differences that result from cis-trans isomerization of specific pSer/Thr-Pro motifs probably underlie most, if not all, Pin1-dependent actions. Phosphorylation-dependent prolyl isomerization by Pin1 remains a unique mode for the modulation of signal transduction. Here, we provide an overview of the plethora of regulatory events that involve this unique enzyme, with a particular focus on oncogenic signalling and neurodegeneration.
