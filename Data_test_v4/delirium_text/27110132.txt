27110132|a|Although there are advances in diagnostic, predictive, and therapeutic strategies, discovering protein biomarker for early detection is required for improving the survival rate of the patients with endometrial carcinoma. In this study, we identify proteins that are differentially expressed between the Stage I endometrial carcinoma and the normal pericarcinous tissues by using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ)-based proteomic analysis. Totally, we screened 1,266 proteins. Among them, 103 proteins were significantly overexpressed, and 30 were significantly downexpressed in endometrial carcinoma. Using the bioinformatics analysis, we identified a list of proteins that might be closely associated with endometrial carcinoma, including CCT7, HSPA8, PCBP2, LONP1, PFN1, and EEF2. We validated the gene overexpression of these molecules in the endometrial carcinoma tissues and found that HSPA8 was most significantly upregulated. We further validated the overexpression of HSPA8 by using immunoblot analysis. Then, HSPA8 siRNA was transferred into the endometrial cancer cells RL-95-2 and HEC-1B. The depletion of HSPA8 siRNAs significantly reduced cell proliferation, promoted cell apoptosis, and suppressed cell growth in both cell lines. Taken together, HSPA8 plays a vital role in the development of endometrial carcinoma. HSPA8 is a candidate biomarker for early diagnosis and therapy of Stage I endometrial carcinoma.
