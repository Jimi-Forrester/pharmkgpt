38540789|a|Exposure to early-life stress (ELS) has been related to an increased susceptibility to psychiatric disorders later in life. Although the molecular mechanisms underlying this association are still under investigation, glucocorticoid signaling has been proposed to be a key mediator. Here, we used two preclinical models, the prenatal stress (PNS) animal model and an in vitro model of hippocampal progenitor cells, to assess the long-term effect of ELS on FKBP5, NR3C1, NR3C2, and FoxO1, four stress-responsive genes involved in the effects of glucocorticoids. In the hippocampus of male PNS rats sacrificed at different time points during neurodevelopment (PND 21, 40, 62), we found a statistically significant up-regulation of FKBP5 at PND 40 and PND 62 and a significant increase in FoxO1 at PND 62. Interestingly, all four genes were significantly up-regulated in differentiated cells treated with cortisol during cell proliferation. As FKBP5 was consistently modulated by PNS at adolescence (PND 40) and adulthood (PND 62) and by cortisol treatment after cell differentiation, we measured a panel of miRNAs targeting FKBP5 in the same samples where FKBP5 expression levels were available. Interestingly, both miR-20b-5p and miR-29c-3p were significantly reduced in PNS-exposed animals (both at PND40 and 62) and also in the in vitro model after cortisol exposure. Our results highlight the key role of miR-20b-5p and miR-29c-3p in sustaining the long-term effects of ELS on the stress response system, representing a mechanistic link possibly contributing to the enhanced stress-related vulnerability to mental disorders.
