34425851|a|BACKGROUND: This study aimed to evaluate the effect of perioperative transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation (TEAS) on postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) in older patients who were diagnosed with gastrointestinal tumor and received radical resection of gastrointestinal tumors under general anesthesia. METHODS: A total of 68 patients who received radical resection of gastrointestinal tumors under general anesthesia were randomly divided into two groups. TEAS group patients received TEAS treatment. The treatment time was 30 min before the induction of anesthesia until the end of the surgery, 1 day before operation and from the first day to the third day after the operation. Except on the day of surgery, we treated the patients for 30 min once a day. In the sham TEAS group, the electronic stimulation was not applied and the treatment was the same as the TEAS group. The primary outcome was perioperative cognition evaluated by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and secondary outcomes were the perioperative level of interleukin-6 (IL-6), S100 calcium-binding protein beta (S100beta), and C-reactive protein (CRP). RESULTS: The postoperative score of MMSE, orientation, memory, and short-term recall in the sham TEAS group was significantly lower than the preoperative and TEAS group (P < 0.05). The incidence of POCD in the TEAS group (21.88%) was lower than those in the sham TEAS group (40.63%). S100beta, IL-6, and CRP in the TEAS group were significantly lower than those in the sham TEAS group on the third day after the operation (P< 0.05). Postoperative S100beta, IL-6, and CRP in two groups were significantly higher than those before operation except for S100beta on the third day after the operation in the TEAS group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Perioperative TEAS treatment reduced the postoperative inflammatory response and increased the postoperative cognitive function score and decrease the incidence of POCD in geriatric patients with gastrointestinal tumor.
