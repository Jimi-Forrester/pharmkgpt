12809069|a|The author reports his results of parenteral piracetam treatment in 193 patients admitted to the Psychiatric Department of Semmelweis Hospital with alcohol withdrawal delirium. Alcohol withdrawal delirium is a complex metabolic disorder, the disturbance of the highest cerebral integrative functions, which is caused by the impairment of cerebral oxidative metabolism. Piracetam is effective on most neurotransmitter systems, without a specific receptor agonism or antagonism, increases the effectivity of different biogenic amine systems, has also an effect on membrane permeability, increases the concentration of NMDA (methyl-D-aspartate) receptors in the impaired brain and improves cognitive functions. In the patients suffered from alcohol dependence piracetam produces positive morphologic changes, by decreasing lipofuscin accumulation. In early stage it prevents the development of delirium. Despite of the great number (approximately 150) of medication that were tried in the treatment of delirium, the ideal one still has not been found. Among the accessible therapeutic possibilities the author searched for methods which make the treatment more effective. The administration of parental piracetam, therefore was brought into his therapeutical protocol. Parenteral piracetam--similarly to literature data--proved to be effective in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal delirium. Considering the present--insufficient--hospital financing, it is remarkable that though the costs of the new therapy are higher than the traditional meprobamat therapy, through less side effect it is more economical (overall costs lower) and by decreasing the time of delirium it is more humane to the patients.
