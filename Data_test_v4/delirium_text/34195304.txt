34195304|a|PURPOSE: To stratify differences in visual semantic and quantitative imaging features in intensive care patients with nonspecific mastoid effusions versus patients with acute mastoiditis (AM) requiring surgical treatment. METHODS: We included 48 patients (male, 28; female, 20; mean age, 59.5 +- 18.1 years) with mastoid opacification (AM, n = 24; control, n = 24) who underwent clinically indicated cerebral CT between 12/2007 and 07/2018 in this retrospective study. Semantic features described the extend and asymmetry of mastoid and middle-ear cavity opacification and complications like erosive changes. Minimum, maximum and mean Hounsfield unit (HU) values were obtained as quantitative features. We analyzed the features employing univariate testing. RESULTS: Compared to intensive care patients, AM patients revealed asymmetric mastoid or middle-ear cavity opacification (likelihood-ratio (LR) < 0.001). Applying a dedicated threshold of the extent of opacification, AM patients reached significance levels of LR = 0.042 and 0.002 for mastoid and middle-ear cavity opacification. AM cases showed higher maximum and mean HU values (p = 0.009, p = 0.024). CONCLUSIONS: We revealed that the extent and asymmetry of mastoid and middle-ear cavity opacification differs significantly between AM patients and intensive care patients. Multicenter research is needed to expand our cohort and possibly pave the way to build a non-invasive predictive model for AM in the future.
