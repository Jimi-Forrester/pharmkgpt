37686198|t|Alteration of Blood Immune Biomarkers in MCI Patients with Different APOE Genotypes after Cognitive Training: A 1 Year Follow-Up Cohort Study.
37686198|a|Many studies aim to detect the early phase of dementia. One of the major ways to achieve this is to identify corresponding biomarkers, particularly immune blood biomarkers. The objective of this study was to identify such biomarkers in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in an experiment that included cognitive training. A group of patients with MCI diagnoses over the age of 65 participated in the study (n = 136). Measurements of cognitive functions (using the Mini-Mental State Examination scale and Montreal Cognitive Assessment) and determination of 27 serum biomarkers were performed twice: on the first visit and on the second visit, one year after the cognitive training. APOE genotypes were also determined. Concentrations of EGF (F = 17; p = 0.00007), Eotaxin (F = 7.17; p = 0.008), GRO (F = 13.42; p = 0.0004), IL-8 (F = 8.16; p = 0.005), MCP-1 (F = 13.46; p = 0.0001) and MDC (F = 5.93; p = 0.016) increased after the cognitive training in MCI patients. All these parameters except IL-8 demonstrated a weak correlation with other immune parameters and were poorly represented in the principal component analysis. Differences in concentrations of IP-10, FGF-2, TGFa and VEGF in patients with MCI were associated with APOE genotype. Therefore, the study identified several immune blood biomarkers that could potentially be associated with changes in cognitive function.
