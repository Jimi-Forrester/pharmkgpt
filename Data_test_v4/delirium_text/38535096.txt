38535096|a|Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) have attracted much attention recently, beyond elemental host immunity, due to their fundamental implication in a variety of pathologic conditions and widespread impactful diseases. Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is one of them, and a major cause of mortality and disability worldwide. Consequently, years of basic and clinical research were dedicated to shedding light on every possible pathophysiologic mechanism that could be used as an effective prevention and treatment tool to ameliorate its burden. This led to the development of complex and prevention protocols and regimens that are now widely used, with lipid-lowering treatment being the current cornerstone; however, this is not adequate to alleviate the residual cardiovascular risk, which remains prominent. Despite the demonstrated pathogenic role of NETs in the progression and complications of ASCVD, little is known about their potential as a therapeutic target and the effects hypolipidemics exert on them.
