37111591|t|Chemical and Biological Properties of Biochanin A and Its Pharmaceutical Applications.
37111591|a|Biochanin A (BCA), an isoflavone derived from various plants such as chickpea, red clover and soybean, is attracting increasing attention and is considered to have applications in the development of pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals due to its anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, anti-cancer and neuroprotective properties. To design optimised and targeted BCA formulations, on one hand there is a need for more in-depth studies on the biological functions of BCA. On the other hand, further studies on the chemical conformation, metabolic composition and bioavailability of BCA need to be conducted. This review highlights the various biological functions, extraction methods, metabolism, bioavailability, and application prospects of BCA. It is hoped that this review will provide a basis for understanding the mechanism, safety and toxicity of BCA and implementing the development of BCA formulations.
