38558630|t|Addressing the Unmet Needs of Patients With Rapidly Progressive Neurological Disease: A Case Report of Palliative Care in Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD).
38558630|a|Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease (CJD) is a rare neurodegenerative disorder that typically progresses rapidly and unrelentingly. Providing comfort and support for patients with CJD presents significant challenges for clinicians and caregivers. In comparison to the more typical disease progression experienced in dementias, the trajectory of CJD differs significantly. This case report delves into these differences and emphasizes the need for the development of guidelines for healthcare professionals and families who care for individuals with CJD. Such guidelines would help facilitate better care and support for patients and their families throughout the course of this devastating illness.
