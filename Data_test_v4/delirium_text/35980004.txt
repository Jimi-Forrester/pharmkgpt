35980004|a|Injectable antipsychotics had been used for patients who refuse oral medications in delirium practice. The objectives were to investigate acceptability of transdermal antipsychotic patches by patients who refuse oral medications and their effectiveness in preventing recurrence of delirium. In this retrospective observational study, data were collected between October 2019 and December 2021. The sample was represented by patients hospitalized because of acute diseases or elective surgery who had delirium on the night before the consultation and had refused oral therapy after consultation. Delirium has been diagnosed according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition. Instead, a transdermal patch of blonanserin, a second-generation antipsychotic drug, was tried. The primary outcome was the rate of patients who accepted it. The secondary outcome was recurrence rates of delirium. As much as 95.1% of patients who refused oral medications (98/103 patients) accepted to receive the transdermal patch. Of these, 24 patients developed delirium again, whereas all five patients who refused it developed delirium again [24.5% (24/98) vs. 100% (5/5); P = 0.0014]. The present findings suggest that transdermal antipsychotic patches are more likely to be accepted by patients who refuse oral medications. Prospective studies are needed.
