33416567|t|Living with Alzheimer Disease and Other Types of Dementia: Stories from Caregivers.
33416567|a|This symposium includes twelve personal narratives from people who have provided care to a spouse, parent, another relative, or friend with Alzheimer disease or related dementias (ADRD). People with ADRDs often face years of cognitive decline with memory and thinking that eventually require help from others to assist with their daily activities. Most people caring for older adults in the US are unpaid family members, friends, or other informal caregivers. People providing care often experience emotional and physical stress, or financial burdens. This symposium also includes three commentaries by experts in the fields of bioethics and philosophy, justice in healthcare, family caregiving, and end of life choices. These narratives provide a forum for exploring caregiver needs, suffering, benefits, and joys, as well as opportunities to improve the way we support caregivers and people with dementia and Alzheimer disease.
