25575659|t|SAR-studies of gamma-secretase modulators with PPARgamma-agonistic and 5-lipoxygenase-inhibitory activity for Alzheimer's disease.
25575659|a|We present the design, synthesis and biological evaluation of compounds containing a 2-(benzylidene)hexanoic acid scaffold as multi-target directed gamma-secretase-modulators. Broad structural variations were undertaken to elucidate the structure-activity-relationships at the 5-position of the aromatic core. Compound 13 showed the most potent activity profile with IC50 values of 0.79muM (Abeta42), 0.3muM (5-lipoxygenase) and an EC50 value of 4.64muM for PPARgamma-activation. This derivative is the first compound exhibiting low micromolar to nanomolar activities for these three targets. Combining gamma-secretase-modulation, PPARgamma-agonism and inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase in one compound could be a novel disease-modifying multi-target-strategy for Alzheimer's disease to concurrently address the causative amyloid pathology and secondary pathologies like chronic brain inflammation.
