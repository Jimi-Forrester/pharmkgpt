31885350|a|OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to analyze the risk factors of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) after deep brain stimulation (DBS) for idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD). METHODS: Patients who received DBS from March 2014 to December 2016 were retrospectively analyzed. The hemorrhage index was derived by combining the hemorrhagic volume and clinical manifestations of ICH. All patients with IHC were followed up for 2 years. RESULTS: Computed tomography showed 13 events of ICH in 11 patients (nine cases in the subthalamic nucleus), including eight cases with symptomatic hemorrhage (seven cases in the subthalamic nucleus). Hemorrhage was characterized by intracranial hematoma in the electrode puncture tract. Male sex and hypertension were significant risk factors for ICH. Hemorrhage in the preferred puncture side was significantly higher than that in the non-preferred puncture side. The mean hemorrhage index was 2.23 +- 0.83 in 11 patients, and no permanent neurological impairment was found during the 2-year follow-up. The effect of DBS on motor symptoms was similar in patients with and without ICH. CONCLUSION: Male sex and hypertension are risk factors of ICH after DBS in PD. The risk of hemorrhage on the first puncture site is significantly higher than that on the second puncture site.
