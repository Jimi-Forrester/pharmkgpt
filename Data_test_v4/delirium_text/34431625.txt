34431625|t|Trends in Comorbidities and Postoperative Complications of Geriatric Hip Fracture Patients from 2000 to 2019: Results from a Hip Fracture Cohort in a Tertiary Hospital.
34431625|a|OBJECTIVE: To describe the secular trends in comorbidities and postoperative complications of geriatric hip fracture patients from the Chinese People's Liberation Army General Hospital Hip Fracture Cohort between 2000 and 2019. METHODS: We included 2,805 hip fracture patients aged 65 years or older and received surgical treatment from 25 January 2000 to 19 December 2019. Demographic characteristics, comorbidities, postoperative complications, length of hospital stay, and the time to surgery were extracted and examined in each 5-year period based on the admission year, namely 2000-2004, 2005-2009, 2010-2014, and 2015-2019. Categorical data were analyzed by chi-squared or Fisher's exact test, with ordinal data by row mean scores difference test and continuous data by one-way analysis of variance. Trends in comorbidities and postoperative complications were examined by the Cochran-Armitage trend test. RESULTS: The average age of the included population was 79.1 +- 7.3 years (mean +- standard deviation), and 69.1% were female. From 2000 to 2019, the proportion of females increased from 59.8% to 73.0% (P for trend <0.05). Hypertension (51.8%), type 2 diabetes (23.6%), coronary heart disease (20.9%), stroke (18.7%), and arrhythmia (11.2%) were the most prevalent five comorbidities. The proportion of hypertension was 27.0%, 45.4%, 53.0%, and 57.2% in each 5-year period with an increasing trend (P for trend <0.05). The proportion of type 2 diabetes was 9.8%, 22.8%, 23.5%, and 26.0% in each 5-year period (P for trend <0.05). Similar increasing trends were found in myocardial infarction, arrhythmia, and tumor. On the contrary, the proportion of patients with major postoperative complications decreased from 2000 to 2019, with 23.0%, 14.6%, 6.5%, and 5.6% in each 5-year period (P for trend <0.05). For each specific postoperative complication, i.e. pneumonia, cardiovascular event, respiratory failure, and in-hospital death, similar decreasing trends were found (all P for trend <0.05). CONCLUSION: This descriptive analysis sheds light on the fact that the health status of the hip fracture population tends to shift gradually. Improving concepts and practices of clinical interventions may help reduce postoperative complications, whereas challenges in the management of comorbidities increase.
