32977607|t|Bee Venom Phospholipase A2 Ameliorates Atherosclerosis by Modulating Regulatory T Cells.
32977607|a|Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease caused by lipids and calcareous accumulations in the vascular wall due to an inflammatory reaction. Recent reports have demonstrated that regulatory T (Treg) cells have an important role as a new treatment for atherosclerosis. This study suggests that bee venom phospholipase A2 (bvPLA2) may be a potential therapeutic agent in atherosclerosis by inducing Treg cells. We examined the effects of bvPLA2 on atherosclerosis using ApoE-/- and ApoE-/-/Foxp3DTR mice. In this study, bvPLA2 increased Treg cells, followed by a decrease in lipid accumulation in the aorta and aortic valve and the formation of foam cells. Importantly, the effect of bvPLA2 was found to depend on Treg cells. This study suggests that bvPLA2 can be a potential therapeutic agent for atherosclerosis.
