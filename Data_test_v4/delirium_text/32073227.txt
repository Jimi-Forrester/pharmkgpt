32073227|t|Postanesthesia care unit delirium following robot-assisted vs open retropubic radical prostatectomy: A prospective observational study.
32073227|a|BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to compare the incidence of early postoperative delirium in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) between robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) in the extreme Trendelenburg position and open retropubic radical prostatectomy (ORP) in supine position. METHODS: Patients were screened for delirium signs 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes following extubation. RESULTS: PACU delirium was present in 39.3% of RARP (64/163) patients and 41.8% of ORP (77/184) patients. Higher age (OR 1.072, 95%CI: 1.034-1.111, P < .001), total intravenous anesthesia (OR 2.001, 95%CI: 1.243-3.221, P = .004), and anesthesia duration (OR 1.255, 95%CI: 1.067-1.476, P = .006) were associated with PACU delirium, but no association was found between surgical technique and PACU delirium. CONCLUSION: Compared with inhalational anesthesia, total intravenous anesthesia using propofol-sufentanil, higher age, and longer duration of anesthesia were associated with PACU delirium. Based on these findings, adverse effects on postoperative recovery and delirium signs do not have to be considered in the choice of surgical approach for radical prostatectomy.
