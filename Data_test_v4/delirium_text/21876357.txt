21876357|t|A systematic literature review of cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers in delirium.
21876357|a|BACKGROUND: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis has great potential to advance understanding of delirium pathophysiology. METHODS: A systematic literature review of CSF studies of DSM or ICD delirium was performed. RESULTS: In 8 studies of 235 patients, delirium was associated with: elevated serotonin metabolites, interleukin-8, cortisol, lactate and protein, and reduced somatostatin, beta-endorphin and neuron-specific enolase. Elevated acetylcholinesterase predicted poor outcome after delirium and higher dopamine metabolites were associated with psychotic features. CONCLUSIONS: No clear conclusions emerged, but the current literature suggests multiple areas for further investigation with more detailed studies.
