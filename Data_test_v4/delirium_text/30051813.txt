30051813|t|The Mobility Volunteer Program: Stepping into the Future of Senior-Friendly Care.
30051813|a|Low mobility during hospitalization is an under-recognized epidemic leading to adverse outcomes (Brown et al. 2009). The goal of the Mobility Volunteer Program (MVP) is to keep older people as active as possible while in hospital to prevent delirium and loss of strength. Maintaining or improving function from admission to discharge increases the likelihood of patients being able to return home sooner and to their prior level of functioning. The MVP is a valuable component of a multi-pronged corporate strategy to improve rates of mobilization at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre. We will describe the MVP and share stakeholder feedback and lessons learned.
