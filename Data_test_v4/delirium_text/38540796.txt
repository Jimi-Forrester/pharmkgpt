38540796|t|Revolutionizing Ischemic Stroke Diagnosis and Treatment: The Promising Role of Neurovascular Unit-Derived Extracellular Vesicles.
38540796|a|Ischemic stroke is a fatal and disabling disease worldwide and imposes a significant burden on society. At present, biological markers that can be conveniently measured in body fluids are lacking for the diagnosis of ischemic stroke, and there are no effective treatment methods to improve neurological function after ischemic stroke. Therefore, new ways of diagnosing and treating ischemic stroke are urgently needed. The neurovascular unit, composed of neurons, astrocytes, microglia, and other components, plays a crucial role in the onset and progression of ischemic stroke. Extracellular vesicles are nanoscale lipid bilayer vesicles secreted by various cells. The key role of extracellular vesicles, which can be released by cells in the neurovascular unit and serve as significant facilitators of cellular communication, in ischemic stroke has been extensively documented in recent literature. Here, we highlight the role of neurovascular unit-derived extracellular vesicles in the diagnosis and treatment of ischemic stroke, the current status of extracellular vesicle engineering for ischemic stroke treatment, and the problems encountered in the clinical translation of extracellular vesicle therapies. Extracellular vesicles derived from the neurovascular unit could provide an important contribution to diagnostic and therapeutic tools in the future, and more studies in this area should be carried out.
