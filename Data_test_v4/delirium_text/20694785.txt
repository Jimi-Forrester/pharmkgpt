20694785|t|Magnetic resonance imaging of Alzheimer's disease: from diagnosis to therapeutic evaluation.
20694785|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating late-life dementia that produces progressive loss of memory and mental faculties in elderly people. It is important to identify the earliest evidence of AD and to monitor the development of this disease for us to make positive response to its management. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is powerful to image the tissue or organ without damnification. MRI can be employed to diagnose the early AD development and monitor the key biomarker development in AD. MRI may be helpful not only in diagnosing early AD, but also in evaluating its development. This article reviews the progress of MRI on the diagnosis and detection of AD, and makes comments on its therapeutic application.
