39177108|a|INTRODUCTION: We aimed to assess the impact of cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) and memantine on cognition, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and mortality in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). METHODS: A total of 1,095 incident DLB patients from the Swedish Registry on cognitive/dementia disorders were included. Using an inverse probability of treatment weighting, the effect of initiating ChEI or memantine within 90 days of DLB diagnosis and nonuse was evaluated on cognitive trajectories and risks of MACE and death. RESULTS: The use of ChEIs significantly slowed cognitive decline at follow-ups (Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE] -0.39 points/y; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.96 to 0.18) compared to memantine (-2.49 points/y; -4.02 to -0.97) and nonuse (-2.50 points/y; -4.28 to -0.73). Treatment groups did not differ in MACE events. ChEI use was associated with lower risk of death in the first year after DLB diagnosis (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.66, 95% CI 0.46, 0.94). DISCUSSION: Our findings illuminate the potential benefits of ChEI treatment in DLB patients. HIGHLIGHTS: Cholinesterase inhibitors slow cognitive decline over a 5-year follow-up period when compared to both memantine treatment and nonuse in patients with dementia with Lewy bodies. Cholinesterase Inhibitors reduce risk of mortality within the initial year, but this effect is not sustained after 1 year in patients with dementia with Lewy bodies.
