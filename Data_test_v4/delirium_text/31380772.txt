31380772|t|Characterizing Alzheimer's Disease With Image and Genetic Biomarkers Using Supervised Topic Models.
31380772|a|Neuroimaging and genetic biomarkers have been widely studied from discriminative perspectives towards Alzheimer's disease (AD) classification, since neuroanatomical patterns and genetic variants are jointly critical indicators for AD diagnosis. Generative methods, designed to model common occurring patterns, could potentially advance the understanding of this disease, but have not been fully explored for AD characterization. Moreover, the introduction of a supervised component into the generative process can constrain the model for more discriminative characterization. In this study, we propose an original method based on supervised topic modeling to characterize AD from a generative perspective, yet maintaining discriminative power at differentiating disease populations. Our topic modeling jointly exploits discretized image features and categorical genetic features. Diagnostic information - cognitively normal (CN), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD - is introduced as a supervision variable. Experimental results on the ADNI cohort demonstrate that our model, while achieving competitive discriminative performance, can discover topics revealing both well-known and novel neuroanatomical patterns including temporal, parietal and frontal regions; as well as associations between genetic factors and neuroanatomical patterns.
