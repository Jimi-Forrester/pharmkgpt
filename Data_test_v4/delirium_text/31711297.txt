31711297|a|While end-of-life (EOL) care has been a relatively common option for patients with terminal cancer, the utilization of EOL care in Alzheimer disease and other dementias has become available more recently. By the time end-stage dementia is present, the clinicians and caregivers become faced with multiple clinical issues-their inability to provide subjective complaints of pain and discomfort, behavioral symptoms, delirium, food refusal, and so on. In addition to providing quality EOL care to the patients, clinicians need to work with their families in an open and empathic manner, assuring that their loved ones will receive supportive measures to keep them comfortable.
