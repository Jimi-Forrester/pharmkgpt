31622587|t|Brahmi (Bacopa monnieri): An ayurvedic herb against the Alzheimer's disease.
31622587|a|Ayurveda is the medicinal science, dealing with utilization of naturally available plant products for treatment. A wide variety of neuroprotective herbs have been reported in Ayurveda. Brahmi, Bacopa monnieri is a nootropic ayurvedic herb known to be effective in neurological disorders from ancient times. Numerous approaches including natural and synthetic compounds have been applied against Alzheimer's disease. Amyloid-beta and Tau are the hallmarks proteins of several neuronal dysfunctions resulting in Alzheimer's disease. Tau is a microtubule-associated protein known to be involved in progression of Alzheimer's disease. The generation of reaction oxygen species, increased neuroinflammation and neurotoxicity are the major physiological dysfunctions associated with Tau aggregates, which leads to dementia and behavioural deficits. Bacoside A, Bacoside B, Bacosaponins, Betulinic acid, etc; are the bioactive component of Brahmi belonging to various chemical families. Each chemical component known have its significant role in neuroprotection. The neuroprotective properties of Brahmi and its bioactive components including reduction of ROS, neuroinflammation, aggregation inhibition of Amyloid-beta and improvement of cognitive and learning behaviour. Here on basis of earlier studies we hypothesize the inhibitory role of Brahmi against Tau-mediated toxicity. The overall studies have concluded that Brahmi can be used as a lead formulation for treatment of Alzheimer's disease and other neurological disorders.
