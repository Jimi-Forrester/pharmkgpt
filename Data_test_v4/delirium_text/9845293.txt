9845293|t|Distribution of A beta-associated proteins in cerebrovascular amyloid of Alzheimer's disease.
9845293|a|Senile plaques and cerebrovascular amyloidosis (CA) are two of the major neuropathological lesions in brains of patients with dementia of the Alzheimer type. We studied the expression of a number of amyloid beta (A beta)-associated proteins in CA, which have previously been identified in senile plaques and which were suggested to play an important role in the pathogenesis of these lesions. Our findings show that involvement of inflammatory components in CA is restricted to activation of the complement system, resulting in deposition of the complement factors C1q, C3c, C4d and the membrane attack complex C5b-9 as well as of the complement inhibitor clusterin. Furthermore, we observed expression of apolipoprotein E, amyloid P component and heparan sulfate proteoglycans in CA, whereas expression of lactoferrin was almost absent. Other inflammatory proteins, known to be present in senile plaques, such as alpha1-antichymotrypsin, alpha2-macroglobulin and intercellular adhesion molecule-1, were absent or detectable only in small amounts. These data suggest that an incomplete inflammatory response occurs in CA as compared to senile plaques. This was confirmed by the finding that the number of cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage around CA was not increased compared to unaffected vessels. Based on their expression patterns, complement factors, apolipoprotein E and heparan sulfate proteoglycans may be produced early in the process of CA formation and may play an important role in the formation of A beta fibrils in CA. The absence of a number of A beta-associated proteins in CA in comparison to senile plaques is in support of a different pathogenesis for these two lesions.
