23590711|a|Inflammation has recently been implicated as a critical mechanism in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Microglia are the resident immune cells in the central nervous system (CNS), and they mediate the inflammatory response in the AD brain. Thus, suppression of microglial activation and subsequent neuroinflammation may be a potential therapeutic approach against AD. In the following review, we briefly discuss the limitations and advantages of current drug targets for AD and then summarize several anti-inflammatory drugs in trial, including natural nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), polyphenols and new drugs synthesized based on multi-target directed ligand (MTDL) design. In addition to their anti-inflammatory effects, these drugs can act as anti-oxidants and reduce microglial activation or amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques. Thus, the studies focused on multiple factors in AD processes might reveal the best potential treatment strategy for the future.
