36979691|a|Fibromyalgia syndrome (FM), one of the most common illnesses that cause chronic widespread pain, continues to present significant diagnostic challenges. The objective of this study was to develop a rapid vibrational biomarker-based method for diagnosing fibromyalgia syndrome and related rheumatologic disorders (systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA)) through portable FT-IR techniques. Bloodspot samples were collected from patients diagnosed with FM (n = 122) and related rheumatologic disorders (n = 70), including SLE (n = 17), RA (n = 43), and OA (n = 10), and stored in conventional protein saver bloodspot cards. The blood samples were prepared by four different methods (blood aliquots, protein-precipitated extraction, and non-washed and water-washed semi-permeable membrane filtration extractions), and spectral data were collected with a portable FT-IR spectrometer. Pattern recognition analysis, OPLS-DA, was able to identify the signature profile and classify the spectra into corresponding classes (Rcv > 0.93) with excellent sensitivity and specificity. Peptide backbones and aromatic amino acids were predominant for the differentiation and might serve as candidate biomarkers for syndromes such as FM. This research evaluated the feasibility of portable FT-IR combined with chemometrics as an accurate and high-throughput tool for distinct spectral signatures of biomarkers related to the human syndrome (FM), which could allow for real-time and in-clinic diagnostics of FM.
