36518808|t|Cardiovascular Risk Factors and Cognitive Performance in Cognitively Normal Non-Hispanic Whites and Mexican Americans From the HABS-HD Cohort.
36518808|a|Objectives: This study aimed to compare the impact of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF) on cognition in non-Hispanic Whites (NHW) versus Mexicans Americans (MA). Methods: A cross sectional analysis was conducted on 663 NHW and 632 MA. Prevalence of specific CVRF were compared between both demographics. Cognition was tested with various neuropsychologic tests. Results: MA had a higher percentage of hypertension, abdominal circumference, diabetes, and current smoking while NHW had a higher prevalence of other CVD. However, specific CVRF impacted NHW neuropsychologic testing on cognition, executive function, and processing, while only memory was affected in MA. Discussion: MA have less access to healthcare services with a higher prevalence of specific CVRF, however previous research has cited a lower mortality compared to NHW, this is known as the Hispanic paradox effect. The Mexican American ethnicity may be a protective factor in cognition creating increased neuropsychologic resilience from CVRF.
