36399866|t|Towards Alzheimer's disease-related targets: One-pot Cu(I)- mediated synthesis of new nitroindazolyltriazoles.
36399866|a|In this work, we have investigated the one pot strategy for the Cu(I)-mediated synthesis of new triazoles bearing nitroindazole moieties using different copper catalysts. The biological activity of newly synthesized nitroindazolyltriazoles towards Alzheimer's disease-related targets, namely cholinesterases, monoamine oxidases, and amyloid aggregation, were investigated. Predictions of target affinity, physicochemical parameters, gastrointestinal absorption and brain penetration were achieved by means of in silico tools.
