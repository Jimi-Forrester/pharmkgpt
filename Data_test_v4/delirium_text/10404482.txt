10404482|t|Incidence of and preoperative predictors for delirium after cardiac surgery.
10404482|a|Incidence of and preoperative predictors for postoperative delirium were studied in 296 patients (age 26-83 years, mean age 63 years) undergoing elective cardiac surgery. Delirium occurred in 40 (13.5%) patients. Predictors included old age, low level of albumin, poor physical condition, use of nifedipine, and a high ratio of the amino acids phenylalanine to the sum of isoleucine, leucine, valine, tyrosine, and tryptophan. These findings suggest that preoperative physical condition and amino acid disturbances may be related to delirium after cardiac surgery in the elderly.
