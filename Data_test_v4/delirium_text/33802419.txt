33802419|t|Seizures and Sepsis: A Narrative Review.
33802419|a|Patients with sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) can develop convulsive or nonconvulsive seizures. The cytokine storm and the overwhelming systemic inflammation trigger the electric circuits that promote seizures. Several neurologic symptoms, associated with this disease, range from mild consciousness impairment to coma. Focal or generalized convulsive seizures are frequent in sepsis, although nonconvulsive seizures (NCS) are often misdiagnosed and prevalent in SAE. In order to map the trigger zone in all patients that present focal or generalized seizures and also to detect NCS, EEG is indicated but continuous EEG (cEEG) is not very widespread; timing, duration, and efficacy of this tool are still unknown. The long-term risk of seizures in survivors is increased. The typical stepwise approach of seizures management begins with benzodiazepines and follows with anticonvulsants up to anesthetic drugs such as propofol or thiopental, which are able to induce burst suppression and interrupt the pathological electrical circuits. This narrative review discusses pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis and treatment of seizures in sepsis.
