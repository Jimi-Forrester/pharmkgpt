38004165|t|Prognostic Nutritional Index Is a Predictive Marker for Health-Related Quality of Life in Patients with Adult Degenerative Scoliosis.
38004165|a|Our aim was to ascertain whether the prognostic nutritional index (PNI), could predict the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in patients with adult degenerative scoliosis (ADS) undergoing corrective surgery. We conducted a retrospective analysis of consecutive patients diagnosed with ADS between January 2013 and June 2021. Three nutritional parameters were employed for analysis (PNI, anemia, and hypoalbuminemia). We utilized the Scoliosis Research Society-22 (SRS-22) questionnaire and the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) questionnaire to assess clinical outcomes. Following the epidemiology guidelines, we presented results from three different models: the crude model, minimally adjusted model, and fully adjusted model. A total of 316 ADS patients were included in the statistical analysis. There was no significant difference in sagittal plane radiographic parameters between the two groups. After adjusting for important confounding factors, PNI was an independent predictor of postoperative HRQOL. Specifically, for each one-unit increase in PNI, there was an approximately 20% higher likelihood of patients achieving a better HRQOL. Furthermore, we did not observe an association between hemoglobin levels or albumin levels and HRQOL. In this study, PNI has been demonstrated to be correlated with the postoperative HRQOL in patients with ADS undergoing corrective surgery.
