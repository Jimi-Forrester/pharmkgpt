37902028|t|Design, synthesis and biological evaluation of novel indanones derivatives as potent acetylcholinesterase/monoamine oxidase B inhibitors.
37902028|a|Aim: Based on a multitarget design strategy, a series of novel indanone-1-benzyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridin hybrids were identified for the potential treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Results: These compounds exhibited significant inhibitory activities against acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and moderate inhibitory activities toward monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B). The optimal compound A1 possessed excellent dual AChE/MAO-B inhibition both in terms of potency (AChE: IC50 = 0.054 +- 0.004 muM; MAO-B: IC50 = 3.25 +- 0.20 muM), moderate inhibitory effects on self-mediated amyloid-beta (Abeta) aggregation and antioxidant activity. In addition, compound A1 exhibited low neurotoxicity. More importantly, compound A1 showed significant cognitive and spatial memory improvements in the scopolamine-induced AD mouse model. Conclusion: All results suggest that compound A1 may become a promising lead of anti-AD drug for further development.
