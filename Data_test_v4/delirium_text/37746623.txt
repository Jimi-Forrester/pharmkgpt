37746623|t|Pain Management in the Postoperative Period for People With Dementia: An Integrative Review.
37746623|a|Objective: With the increased global prevalence of older people with dementia, more will present for surgery over the coming decades. Therefore, the objective of this study was to synthesize the existing research about how pain in managed for people with dementia in the postoperative period and discuss the implications for clinical practice. Methods: For this integrative review, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health literature, Medline/Pubmed, ProQuest, ERIC, and Health Source Nursing were searched to identify original empirical research published between 2000 and 2021. Tasks were divided between reviewers to ensure independent study selection, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment. Results: Eleven articles were eligible. The evidence is incompletely developed therefore the review focused on pain assessment, the types and amount of pain relief, that people with dementia receive less analgesia than people without dementia and the challenges for effective pain management. Most studies were surgery for hip fracture so there is scope to look at outcomes for other types of surgery. Analgesia was administered but it was noted that even over a 20-year period, people with dementia received less than cognitively intact people. Pain management could have a stronger evidence-base with more psychometric development of pain assessment tools. Challenges are due to the impaired ability of the person with dementia to communicate pain and that clinicians have difficulty understanding pain behavior in people with dementia. Conclusion: Adequate pain management for people with dementia in the postoperative period is important for a faster and better recovery.
