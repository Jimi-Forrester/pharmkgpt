35806196|a|Vascular and lymphatic vessels drive breast cancer (BC) growth and metastasis. We assessed the cell growth (proliferation, migration, and capillary formation), gene-, and protein-expression profiles of Vascular Endothelial Cells (VECs) and Lymphatic Endothelial Cells (LECs) exposed to a conditioned medium (CM) from estrogen receptor-positive BC cells (MCF-7) in the presence or absence of Estradiol. We demonstrated that MCF-7-CM stimulated growth and capillary formation in VECs but inhibited LEC growth. Consistently, MCF-7-CM induced ERK1/2 and Akt phosphorylation in VECs and inhibited them in LECs. Gene expression analysis revealed that the LECs were overall ( 10-fold) more sensitive to MCF-7-CM exposure than VECs. Growth/angiogenesis and cell cycle pathways were upregulated in VECs but downregulated in LECs. An angiogenesis proteome array confirmed the upregulation of 23 pro-angiogenesis proteins in VECs. In LECs, the expression of genes related to ATP synthesis and the ATP content were reduced by MCF-7-CM, whereas MTHFD2 gene, involved in folate metabolism and immune evasion, was upregulated. The contrasting effect of MCF-7-CM on the growth of VECs and LECs was reversed by inhibiting the TGF-beta signaling pathway. The effect of MCF-7-CM on VEC growth was also reversed by inhibiting the VEGF signaling pathway. In conclusion, BC secretome may facilitate cancer cell survival and tumor growth by simultaneously promoting vascular angiogenesis and inhibiting lymphatic growth. The differential effects of BC secretome on LECs and VECs may be of pathophysiological relevance in BC.
