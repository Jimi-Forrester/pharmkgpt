38057753|a|BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of introducing the Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) nursing model on postoperative delirium occurrence and rehabilitation quality in elderly patients with femoral neck fractures. METHODS: A total of 160 elderly patients with femoral neck fractures, who met the inclusion criteria and were admitted between March 2021 to March 2023, were divided into two groups: the traditional care group and the ERAS nursing model group. In addition to traditional care measures, the ERAS nursing model group received interventions based on the principles of the ERAS nursing model. The occurrence of delirium and sleep quality were observed at 24, 48, and 72 h postoperatively, as well as during the overall hospital stay. The duration of hospitalization, time to first mobilization, and post-discharge follow-up on quality of life were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: The ERAS nursing model group exhibited a significant difference in the occurrence of delirium at 48 and 72 h postoperatively, as well as during the overall hospital stay (P < 0.05). However, there was no significant difference in the occurrence of delirium at 24 h postoperatively (P > 0.05). The sleep quality of the two groups showed a statistically significant difference (P < 0.05). The ERAS nursing model group had shorter time to first mobilization, reduced hospitalization duration, and higher Harris and SF-36 scores during post-discharge follow-up, compared to the traditional care group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of the ERAS nursing model in elderly patients with femoral neck fractures improved postoperative sleep quality, reduced delirium occurrence, shortened average hospitalization duration, and enhanced patients' quality of life.
