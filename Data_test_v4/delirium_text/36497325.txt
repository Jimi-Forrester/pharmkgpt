36497325|t|Design and Experimental Setup of a Robotic Medical Instrument for Brachytherapy in Non-Resectable Liver Tumors.
36497325|a|This paper presents a study regarding the design and the experimental setup of a medical robotic system for brachytherapy using tribology analysis. The robotic system is composed of a collaborative robotic arm and a multi-needle brachytherapy instrument controlled using a unified control system embedding a haptic device and force-feedback. This work is oriented towards identifying the technical characteristics of the system components to determine the accuracy of the procedure, as well as using different scenarios for needle insertion in ex vivo porcine liver tissue in order to determine the forces required for insertion and extraction of the needle and the friction coefficient that accompanies the previously mentioned forces. Subsequent to the computation of the friction forces, the normal forces and the wear during the needle insertion are determined with the scope of predicting the lifecycle of some components of the medical device.
