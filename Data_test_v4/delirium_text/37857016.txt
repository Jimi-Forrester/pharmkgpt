37857016|a|Effective preventive measures against postoperative cognitive dysfunction in older adults are urgently needed. In this study, we investigated the effect of electroacupuncture (EA) on anesthesia and surgery-induced cognitive decline in aged rats by RNA-seq analysis, behavioral testing, Golgi-Cox staining, dendritic spine analysis, immunofluorescence assay and western blot analysis. EA ameliorated anesthesia and surgery induced-cognitive decline. RNA-seq analysis identified numerous differentially-expressed genes, including 353 upregulated genes and 563 downregulated genes, after pretreatment with EA in aged rats with postoperative cognitive dysfunction. To examine the role of CREB in EA, we injected adeno-associated virus (AAV) into the CA1 region of the hippocampus bilaterally into the aged rats to downregulate the transcription factor. EA improved synaptic plasticity, structurally and functionally, by activating the MAPK/ERK/CREB signaling pathway in aged rats. Together, our findings suggest that EA protects against anesthesia and surgery-induced cognitive decline in aged rats by activating the MAPK/ERK/CREB signaling pathway and enhancing hippocampal synaptic plasticity.
