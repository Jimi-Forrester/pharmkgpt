28208059|a|Protein misfolding and aggregation unify several devastating neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. There are no effective therapeutics for these disorders and none that target the reversal of the aberrant protein misfolding and aggregation that cause disease. Here, I showcase important advances to define, engineer, and apply protein disaggregases to mitigate deleterious protein misfolding and counter neurodegeneration. I focus on two exogenous protein disaggregases, Hsp104 from yeast and gene 3 protein from bacteriophages, as well as endogenous human protein disaggregases, including: (a) Hsp110, Hsp70, Hsp40, and small heat-shock proteins; (b) HtrA1; and (c) NMNAT2 and Hsp90. I suggest that protein-disaggregase modalities can be channeled to treat numerous fatal and presently incurable neurodegenerative diseases.
