38001948|t|Quantification of Bile Acids in Cerebrospinal Fluid: Results of an Observational Trial.
38001948|a|(1) Background: Bile acids, known as aids in intestinal fat digestion and as messenger molecules in serum, can be detected in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), although the blood-brain barrier is generally an insurmountable obstacle for bile acids. The exact mechanisms of the occurrence, as well as possible functions of bile acids in the central nervous system, are not precisely understood. (2) Methods: We conducted a single-center observational trial. The concentrations of 15 individual bile acids were determined using an in-house LC-MS/MS method in 54 patients with various acute and severe disorders of the central nervous system. We analyzed CSF from ventricular drainage taken within 24 h after placement, and blood samples were drawn at the same time for the presence and quantifiability of 15 individual bile acids. (3) Results: At a median time of 19.75 h after a cerebral insult, the concentration of bile acids in the CSF was minute and almost negligible. The CSF concentrations of total bile acids (TBAs) were significantly lower compared to the serum concentrations (serum 0.37 micromol/L [0.24, 0.89] vs. 0.14 micromol/L [0.05, 0.43]; p = 0.033). The ratio of serum-to-CSF bile acid levels calculated from the respective total concentrations were 3.10 [0.94, 14.64] for total bile acids, 3.05 for taurocholic acid, 14.30 [1.11, 27.13] for glycocholic acid, 0.0 for chenodeoxycholic acid, 2.19 for taurochenodeoxycholic acid, 1.91 [0.68, 8.64] for glycochenodeoxycholic acid and 0.77 [0.0, 13.79] for deoxycholic acid; other bile acids were not detected in the CSF. The ratio of CSF-to-serum S100 concentration was 0.01 [0.0, 0.02]. Serum total and conjugated (but not unconjugated) bilirubin levels and serum TBA levels were significantly correlated (total bilirubin p = 0.031 [0.023, 0.579]; conjugated bilirubin p = 0.001 [0.193, 0.683]; unconjugated p = 0.387 [-0.181, 0.426]). No correlations were found between bile acid concentrations and age, delirium, intraventricular blood volume, or outcome measured on a modified Rankin scale. (4) Conclusions: The determination of individual bile acids is feasible using the current LC-MS/MS method. The results suggest an intact blood-brain barrier in the patients studied. However, bile acids were detected in the CSF, which could have been achieved by active transport across the blood-brain barrier.
