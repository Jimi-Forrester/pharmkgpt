38018291|a|BACKGROUND: Bladder cancer (BCa) is a highly malignant tumor, and if left untreated, it can develop severe hematuria and tumor metastasis, thereby endangering the patient's life. The purpose of this paper was to detect the expression of ATAD3A in BCa and research the relationship between ATAD3A and pathological features of bladder cancer and the prognosis of patients. METHODS: First, the expression of ATAD3A in BCa and normal bladder tissues was analyzed based on the UALCAN and Oncomine public databases. Second, 491 cases of surgically resected bladder cancer specimens and 110 cases of normal adjacent tissues were immunohistochemically stained. The expression of ATAD3A was quantified, and the value and prognosis of ATAD3A as a biomarker of BCa were evaluated. RESULTS: The expression of ATAD3A in bladder cancer tissues was higher than that in normal bladder mucosa. High expression of ATAD3A was correlated with patient age, tumor size, number of tumors, distant metastasis, lymph node metastasis, lymphovascular invasion, and TNM stage (p < 0.05). Overexpression of ATAD3A is closely related to cancer patient survival. The mean survival time of bladder cancer patients with high ATAD3A expression was shorter than those with low ATAD3A levels. According to the relative comparing result, the high ATAD3A expression herald reduced overall survival in BCa patients. CONCLUSIONS: The abnormal overexpression of ATAD3A may be related to the initiation and progress of bladder cancer. The upregulation of ATAD3A can be used as an effective indicator to diagnose bladder cancer and predict tumor progression. Furthermore, the combination of information from public databases and the results of clinical sample analysis can help us better understand the mechanism of action of molecular oncogenes in bladder cancer.
