37193855|t|Anesthetic management of a patient with an electroencephalogram phenotype for a "vulnerable brain": a case report.
37193855|a|BACKGROUND: Low frontal alpha power is an electroencephalogram phenotype suggesting vulnerability to anesthetics. This phenotype for a "vulnerable brain" carries risks for burst suppression at lower-than-expected anesthetic concentrations and therefore for postoperative delirium. CASE PRESENTATION: A 73-year-old man underwent a laparoscopic Miles' operation. He was monitored with a bispectral index monitor. Before the skin incision, the fraction of age-adjusted minimum alveolar concentration of desflurane was 0.48, and a spectrogram showed slow-delta oscillation despite a bispectral index value of 38-48. Although the fraction of age-adjusted minimum alveolar concentration of desflurane decreased to 0.33, the EEG signature remained unchanged, along with a similar bispectral index value. No burst suppression patterns were observed throughout the whole procedure, and he did not experience postoperative delirium. CONCLUSIONS: This case suggests that monitoring of electroencephalogram signatures is helpful for detecting patients with a "vulnerable brain" and for providing optimal anesthetic depth in such patients.
