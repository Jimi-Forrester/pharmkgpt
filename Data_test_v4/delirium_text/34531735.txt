34531735|t|Altered Patterns of Amplitude of Low-Frequency Fluctuations and Fractional Amplitude of Low-Frequency Fluctuations Between Amnestic and Vascular Mild Cognitive Impairment: An ALE-Based Comparative Meta-Analysis.
34531735|a|Background: Changes in the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) and the fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF) have provided stronger evidence for the pathophysiology of cognitive impairment. Whether the altered patterns of ALFF and fALFF differ in amnestic cognitive impairment (aMCI) and vascular mild cognitive impairment (vMCI) is largely unknown. The purpose of this study was to explore the ALFF/fALFF changes in the two diseases and to further explore whether they contribute to the diagnosis and differentiation of these diseases. Methods: We searched PubMed, Ovid, and Web of Science databases for articles on studies using the ALFF/fALFF method in patients with aMCI and vMCI. Based on the activation likelihood estimation (ALE) method, connectivity modeling based on coordinate meta-analysis and functional meta-analysis was carried out. Results: Compared with healthy controls (HCs), patients with aMCI showed increased ALFF/fALFF in the bilateral parahippocampal gyrus/hippocampus (PHG/HG), right amygdala, right cerebellum anterior lobe (CAL), left middle temporal gyrus (MTG), left cerebrum temporal lobe sub-gyral, left inferior temporal gyrus (ITG), and left cerebrum limbic lobe uncus. Meanwhile, decreased ALFF/fALFF values were also revealed in the bilateral precuneus (PCUN), bilateral cuneus (CUN), and bilateral posterior cingulate (PC) in patients with aMCI. Compared with HCs, patients with vMCI predominantly showed decreased ALFF/fALFF in the bilateral CUN, left PCUN, left PC, and right cingulate gyrus (CG). Conclusions: The present findings suggest that ALFF and fALFF displayed remarkable altered patterns between aMCI and vMCI when compared with HCs. Thus, the findings of this study may serve as a reliable tool for distinguishing aMCI from vMCI, which may help understand the pathophysiological mechanisms of these diseases.
