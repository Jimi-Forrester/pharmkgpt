37231165|t|Co-twin design in brain imaging-review on biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease.
37231165|a|Twin samples allow to conduct a quasi-experimental co-twin case-control approach that can control for genetic and environmental confounding in brain-cognition associations, being more informative on causality compared with studies in unrelated individuals. We conducted a review of studies that have utilized discordant co-twin design to investigate the associations of brain imaging markers of Alzheimer's disease and cognition. Inclusion criteria encompassed twin pairs discordant for cognition or Alzheimer's disease imaging markers and reporting of within-twin pair comparison on the association between cognition and brain measures. Our PubMed search (2022 April 23, updated 2023 March 9) resulted in 18 studies matching these criteria. Alzheimer's disease imaging markers have been addressed only by few studies, most with small sample size. Structural magnetic resonance imaging studies have indicated greater hippocampal volume and thicker cortex in co-twins with better cognitive performance compared with their co-twins with poorer cognitive performance. No studies have looked at cortical surface area. Positron emission tomography imaging studies have suggested that lower cortical glucose metabolism rate and higher cortical neuroinflammation, amyloid, and tau accumulations are related to poorer episodic memory in within-twin pair comparisons. Thus far, only cross-sectional within-twin pair associations of cortical amyloid and hippocampal volume with cognition have been replicated.
