31350990|t|Associated Factors for Osteoporosis and Fracture in Chinese Elderly.
31350990|a|BACKGROUND The factors associated with osteoporosis are poorly understood in the Chinese population. This study aimed to examine the factors associated with osteoporosis and with fractures in a Chinese elderly population. MATERIAL AND METHODS This was a cross-sectional study of elderly people living in Tianjin between 2012 and 2014. Bone mineral density was measured by dual X-ray absorptiometry. The subjects completed a questionnaire about lifestyle habits, personal and family medical history, calcium intake, and exercising. Data were gathered on occurrence of fracture at 5 years or August 2018, whichever occurred first. RESULTS There were 298 individuals with osteoporosis (18.5% male, median age 67 years) and 397 without (46.3% male, median age 62 years). Male sex (OR=0.051, 95% CI: 0.021-0.126), age (OR=1.049, 95% CI: 1.099-1.202), being divorced/widowed (OR=2.445, 95% CI: 1.219-4.904), digestive ulcer history (OR=3.805, 95% CI: 1.539-9.405), family history of hunchback (OR=2.659, 95% CI: 1.145-6.175), family history of osteoarthropathy (OR=4.222, 95% CI: 2.128-8.375), fracture history (OR=2.138, 95% CI: 1.307-3.496), drinking green tea (OR=0.352, 95% CI: 0.217-0.574), and exercising (OR=0.303, 95% CI: 0.193-0.475) were independently associated with osteoporosis. Digestive ulcer history (OR=3.183, 95% CI: 1.178-8.5992), exercising (OR=0.354, 95% CI: 0.139-0.903), and taking calcium supplements during follow-up (OR=0.262, 95% CI: 0.112-0.611) were independently associated with fractures in patients with osteoporosis. CONCLUSIONS Female sex, age, marital status, history of digestive ulcer and fracture, and family history of hunchback and osteoarthropathy are associated with osteoporosis among elderly subjects, while drinking green tea and exercising are inversely associated. Among the patients with osteoporosis, a history of digestive ulcer is associated with fractures, while exercising and taking calcium supplements are inversely associated.
