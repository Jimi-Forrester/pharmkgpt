33247420|t|Decline of coronary heart disease mortality is strongly effected by changing patterns of underlying causes of death: an analysis of mortality data from 27 countries of the WHO European region 2000 and 2013.
33247420|a|Mortality rates for coronary heart disease (CHD) experience a longstanding decline, attributed to progress in prevention, diagnostics and therapy. However, CHD mortality rates vary between countries. To estimate whether national patterns of causes of death impact CHD mortality, data from the WHO "European detailed mortality database" for 2000 and 2013 for populations aged >= 80 years was analyzed. We extracted mortality rates for total mortality, cardiovascular diseases, neoplasms, dementia and ill-defined causes. We calculated proportions of selected causes of death among all deaths, and proportions of selected cardiovascular causes among cardiovascular deaths. CHD mortality rates were recalculated after re-coding ill-defined causes of death. Association between CHD mortality rates and proportions of CHD deaths was estimated by population-weighted linear regression. National patterns of causes of death were divers. In 2000, CHD was assigned as cause of death in 13-53% of all cardiovascular deaths. Until 2013, this proportion changed between - 65% (Czech Republic) and + 57% (Georgia). Dementia was increasingly assigned as underlying cause of death in Western Europe, but rarely in eastern European countries. Ill-defined causes accounted for between < 1% and 53% of all cardiovascular deaths. CHD mortality rates were closely linked to a countries' proportion of cardiovascular deaths assigned to CHD (R2 = 0.95 for 2000 and 0.99 for 2013). We show that CHD mortality is considerably influenced by national particularities in certifying death. Changes in CHD mortality rates reflect changes in certifying competing underlying causes of death. This must be accounted for when discussing reasons for the CHD mortality decline.
