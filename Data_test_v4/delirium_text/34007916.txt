METHODS: We recruited 47 amyloid-negative CN older adults (mean age +- standard deviation, 65.0 +- 7.9 years; 26 women). All participants underwent 3D T1-weighted MRI and 11C-Pittsburgh compound-B and 18F-THK5351 positron emission tomography scans. Four local network metrics (betweenness centrality, clustering coefficient, characteristic path length, and degree) were computed and rendered on individual brain images. We then evaluated the correlations between 18F-THK5351 positron emission tomography images and local network metric images at the voxel level. RESULTS: Significant positive correlations of the four local network metrics with 18F-THK5351 were detected in the bilateral caudate. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that tau and neuroinflammation in CN older adults may influence the gray matter structural network in the caudate.
