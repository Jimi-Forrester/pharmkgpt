28208916|t|Delirium in Parkinson's Disease: A Cocktail Diagnosis.
28208916|a|Mental disturbances have been described in patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD). Of these, the common conditions are delirium and psychosis. Delirium has been attributed to change of environment, especially hospital stay and infections; while psychosis is due to drugs like dopamine agonists. This is a case of a 75-year-old male, on levodopa therapy for PD, who presented with delirium and ended up with a cocktail diagnosis: Cryptococcal meningitis, Hashimoto's Encephalopathy (HE), Urinary tract infection with acute renal failure, Uremic encephalopathy and Levodopa induced psychosis. This case report, therefore, highlights the need to look for other causes of delirium in a patient with PD who is on levodopa therapy.
