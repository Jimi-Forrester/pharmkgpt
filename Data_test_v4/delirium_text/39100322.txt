39100322|t|3-Benzylaminomethyl Lithocholic Acid Derivatives Exhibited Potent and Selective Uncompetitive Inhibitory Activity Against Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase 1B (PTP1B).
39100322|a|Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) is a promising drug target for treating type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and obesity. As a result, developing new therapies that target PTP1B is an attractive strategy for treating these diseases. Herein, we detail the synthesis of 15 lithocholic acid (LA) derivatives, each containing different benzylaminomethyl groups attached to the C3 position of the steroid skeleton. The derivatives were assessed against two forms of PTP1B enzyme (hPTP1B1-400 and hPTP1B1-285), and the most potent compounds were then tested against T-cell protein tyrosine phosphatase (TCPTP) to determine their selectivity. The results showed that compounds 6m and 6n were more potent than the reference compounds (ursolic acid, chlorogenic acid, suramin, and TCS401). Additionally, both compounds exhibited greater potency over hPTP1B1-400. Furthermore, enzyme kinetic studies on hPTP1B1-400 revealed that these two lithocholic acid derivatives have an uncompetitive inhibition against hPTP1B1-400 with K i values of 2.5 and 3.4 muM, respectively. Interestingly, these compounds were around 75-fold more selective for PTP1B over TCPTP. Finally, docking studies and molecular dynamics simulations (MDS) were conducted to determine how these compounds interact with PTP1B. The docking studies revealed hydrophobic and H-bond interactions with amino acid residues in the unstructured region. MDS showed that these interactions persisted throughout the 200 ns simulation, indicating the crucial role of the unstructured zone in the biological activity and inhibition of PTP1B.
