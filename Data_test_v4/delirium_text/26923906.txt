26923906|a|OBJECTIVE: Evaluate change in practice and beliefs regarding delirium among nurses, pharmacists, respiratory therapists and physicians in a trauma intensive care unit. METHODOLOGY/DESIGN/SETTING: Descriptive pre and post-design at a Level One Trauma Center. Education on causes of delirium, risk factors, strategies to prevent delirium and routine screening. OUTCOME MEASURES: Change in practice and beliefs regarding delirium. RESULTS: McNemars test measured the differences between pre- and post-questionnaires comparing the proportion of staff changed their responses in one direction to those who went in the opposite direction. Changes in "Delirium is largely preventable", were statistically significant (p=0.035). Haldol was the medication of choice for treating delirium, with an increase in use (p=0.062) post-intervention. The majority of participants believed a high percentage of patients experience delirium in a trauma intensive care. The two most frequent medical complications associated with delirium pre-questionnaire was over sedation 8 (22%) and falls 9 (24%) and in post-questionnaire, over sedation 12 (26%) and falls 13 (28%). CONCLUSIONS: An educational intervention emphasising the importance of screening for delirium, risk factors for delirium and approaches to decrease the incidence of delirium can improve identifying and correctly treating delirium in a critical care setting. An educational program had concrete results in respondents' knowledge about delirium.
