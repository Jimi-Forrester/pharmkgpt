33960016|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases. Only 10% of all cases are familial form, the remaining 90% are sporadic form with unknown genetic background. The etiology of sporadic AD is still not fully understood. Pathogenesis and pathobiology of this disease are limited due to the limited number of experimental models. We used primary culture of fibroblasts derived from patients diagnosed with sporadic form of AD for investigation of dynamic properties of mitochondria, including fission-fusion process and localization of mitochondria within the cell. We observed differences in mitochondrial network organization with decreased mitochondrial transport velocity, and a drop in the frequency of fusion-fission events. These studies show how mitochondrial dynamics adapt to the conditions of long-term mitochondrial stress that prevails in cells of sporadic form of AD.
