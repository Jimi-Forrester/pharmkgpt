38195523|a|Nowadays, the population is still struggling with a post-COVID19 syndrome known as long COVID, including a broad spectrum of neurological problems. There is an urgent need for a better understanding and exploration of the mechanisms of coronavirus neurotropism. For this purpose, the neurotropic strain of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV-JHM) originating from the beta-coronavirus genus, the same as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been used. The role of the cytoskeleton during virus replication in neurons in vitro was determined to understand the mechanisms of MHV-JHM neuroinfection. We have described for the first time the changes of actin filaments during MHV-JHM infection. We also observed productive replication of MHV-JHM in neurons during 168 h p.i. and syncytial cytopathic effect. We discovered that the MHV-JHM strain modulated neuronal cytoskeleton during infection, which were manifested by: (i) condensation of actin filaments in the cortical layer of the cytoplasm, (ii) formation of microtubule cisternae structures containing viral antigen targeting viral replication site (iii) formation of tunneling nanotubes used by MHV-JHM for intercellular transport. Additionally, we demonstrated that the use of cytoskeletal inhibitors have reduced virus replication in neurons, especially noscapine and nocodazole, the microtubule shortening factors.
