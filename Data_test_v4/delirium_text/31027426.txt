31027426|t|Delirium in patients with ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke: findings from a scoping review.
31027426|a|BACKGROUND: Delirium is a complex syndrome characterised by disturbances in attention and awareness, associated with alterations in cognitive functions, which can emerge in a time frame of hours or days and tend to fluctuate in severity over time. Delirium is a clinical manifestation of the brain's vulnerability and diminished resilience to insult. Stroke patients are particularly vulnerable to delirium episodes. AIMS: The aim of this study was to map: (a) studies focused on ischaemic or haemorrhagic post-stroke delirium; (b) factors that have been investigated as being possibly associated with post-stroke delirium; and (c) outcomes that have been studied to date. METHODS: A scoping review was performed. Medline, CINAHL, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, PsycINFO and Scopus databases were searched. Eligible studies were those: (a) exploring any variable regarding delirium in patients with stroke; (b) involving adults; (c) as primary studies; (d) written in English; and (e) published before April 2017. RESULTS: To date 25 studies have been published, mainly prospective or cohort studies. The most commonly studied predisposing factors have been the older age, gender, aetiology of the stroke and its location, and the presence of previous cognitive decline/dementia. The most studied precipitating factors to date have been pneumonia, urinary tract infections and symptoms of neglect. Functional dependence, length of inhospital stays, post-stroke cognitive impairments or dementia, short and long-term mortality have been the most studied post-stroke delirium outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Studies across different clinical settings, also at the international level, including more female patients and a wider range of ages should be designed in order to improve the evidence available to develop specific clinical guidelines. Standardised frameworks of research addressing the great variability of methods and measures used in the field should be established at the international level by clinicians and researchers' experts in the field.
