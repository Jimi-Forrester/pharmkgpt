31700553|a|Enterocutaneous fistulas (ECFs) are a significant complication of abdominal surgery which present a significant therapeutic challenge for clinicians. Definitive surgical treatment of these fistulas is not without significant risk, which both patients and clinicians would seek to avoid. We present a case of successful treatment of a low output jejunal ECF by percutaneous embolization using an ethiodized oil and n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate glue mixture in a 40-year-old man who developed an ECF after inadvertent jejunostomy tube removal. This case demonstrates the technique and suitability of a widely available embolic agent for treatment of proximal small bowel ECFs. In addition, the case illustrates the potential of minimally invasive interventional radiological procedures in the management of ECFs, particularly in high-risk patients, as an alternative to surgery.
