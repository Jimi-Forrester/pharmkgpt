39318239|t|Suppression of CNS APOE4 Expression by miRNAs Delivered by the S2 AAVrh.10 Capsid-modified AAV Vector.
39318239|a|The homozygous APOE4 genotype is the major risk factor for the development of early Alzheimer's disease. Genome engineering studies in mouse models of human APOE4-dependent pathology have established that reduction of APOE4 expression can rescue the phenotype. We hypothesized that APOE4 could be suppressed in the CNS of APOE4 homozygotes using adeno-associated virus (AAV) expression of microRNAs (miRNA) designed to hybridize to APOE mRNA. We screened 9 different miRNAs targeting APOE following transfection in HEK293T and Huh7 cells. Optimal APOE suppression was obtained with mir2A (targeting coding region nt330-351) and mirN4 (3' untranslated region nt1142-1162). miRNA expression cassettes were designed with two copies of each of these two miRNAs co-expressed with a mCherry transgene. To optimize delivery of these miRNAs, an engineered AAVrh.10 variant was identified from a screen of multiple peptide insertions into capsid loop IV and substitutions in loop VIII. This led to identifying the AAV.S2 capsid with enhanced transduction of both neurons and glia and enhanced distribution in the brain. The engineered capsid was used to deliver the APOE miRNA suppression cassette to the hippocampus of TRE4 mice (human APOE4 knock-in replacement of the murine apoE locus). Two weeks after intra-hippocampus administration, regional expression of miRNA at the injection site was quantified at the mRNA level relative to an endogenous reference. The AAV.S2 capsid provided 2.31 +- 0.37-fold higher expression of miRNA over that provided by AAVrh.10 (p<0.05). In the targeted region, a single intra-hippocampus AAV.S2 administration suppressed hippocampal APOE4 mRNA levels by 76.5 +- 3.9% compared to 41.3 +- 3.3% with the same cassette delivered by the wildtype AAVrh.10 capsid (p<0.0001). We conclude that an expression cassette with two different miRNAs targeting APOE4 delivered by the AAV.S2 capsid will generate highly significant suppression of APOE4 in the CNS.
