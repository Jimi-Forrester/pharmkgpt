31986369|t|Risk factors and outcomes among delirium subtypes in adult ICUs: A systematic review.
31986369|a|PURPOSE: Use systematic review methodology to summarize risk factors and outcomes for each delirium subtype (hypoactive, hyperactive and mixed) in an adult ICU population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched the MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, SCOPUS, Web of Science and PsycINFO databases from database inception until August 13, 2018, with no restrictions. RESULTS: Of 9635 abstracts, 20 studies were included. Older age was not associated with any delirium subtype in 4/7 (57%) studies. Sex was not associated with any delirium subtype in 4/4 (100%) studies. Mortality was consistently associated with hypoactive delirium in 4/7 (57%) studies. The evidence supporting the association of APACHE-II score, mechanical ventilation, length of stay, duration of delirium and removal of tubes were inconsistent across studies. CONCLUSIONS: Although included studies reported on many subtype-specific risk factors and outcomes, heterogeneity in reporting and methodological quality limited the generalizability of the results and the evidence for many subtype-specific risk factors or outcomes is inconsistent across studies. Standardized methodology and the creation of a universal template for collecting data in ICU delirium studies are essential moving forward; helping to identify subtype-specific risk factors or outcomes and strengthen the association of potential risk factors or outcomes.
