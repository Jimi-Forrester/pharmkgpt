37447664|a|In this paper, a 2-mercaptobenzimidazole-copper nanoparticles (MBI-CuNPs) fluorescent probe with high performance based on 2-mercaptobenzimidazole functionalized copper nanoparticles was synthesized by a hydrothermal method and used for cysteine (Cys) detection in serum. The MBI-CuNPs probe exhibits strong fluorescence emission at 415 nm under the excitation at 200 nm, which is attributed to the metal-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) transition through the coordination of an MBI ligand and monovalent copper. Furthermore, the MBI-CuNPs probe has a high quenching fluorescence response to Cys, and shows a good linearity relationship with Cys in 0.05-65 microM, with a detection limit of 52 nM. Moreover, the MBI-CuNPs probe could eliminate the interference of biological mercaptan Hcy and GSH with a similar structure and reaction properties, due to the strong electron-donating ability of Cys, which can quench the fluorescence of the MBI-CuNPs probe. The MBI-CuNPs probe was applied to the analysis of Cys in real serum, and the absolute recovery rate was as high as 90.23-97.00%. Such a fluorescent probe with high sensitivity and selectivity has potential applications for the early prevention of various diseases caused by abnormal Cys levels.
