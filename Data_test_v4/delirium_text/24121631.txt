24121631|a|In the brain, apolipoprotein E (APOE) delivers cholesterol-rich lipoproteins to neurons to support synaptogenesis and maintenance of synaptic connections. Three APOE alleles exist in the human population with epsilon4 being an Alzheimer disease (AD) risk gene and epsilon2 being protective relative to the common epsilon3 variant. Many hypotheses have been advanced concerning allele-specific effects of APOE on neurodegeneration including effects on Abeta clearance, synaptic transmission, or neurotoxicity. Central to most proposed APOE functions is its interaction with receptors that mediate cellular uptake of this ligand. Several members of the LDL receptor gene family have been implicated as APOE receptors in the (patho)physiology of APOE in the brain, yet their specific modes of action in AD remain controversial. Recently, the pro-neurotrophin receptor sortilin has been identified as a novel APOE receptor in neurons. Ablation of sortilin expression in mice results in accumulation of APOE and Abeta in the brain. Moreover, primary neurons lacking sortilin exhibit significantly impaired uptake of APOE/Abeta complexes. Despite increased brain APOE levels, sortilin-deficient animals recapitulate anomalies in brain lipid homeostasis seen in APOE null mice, indicating functional deficiency in APOE uptake pathways. Taken together, these findings suggest a link between Abeta catabolism and pro-neurotrophin signaling converging on this receptor pathway.
