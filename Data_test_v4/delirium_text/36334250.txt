36334250|t|Effects of Peripheral Neural Blocks in Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy: a Pilot Study on Cognitive Functions in Severe Obese Patients.
36334250|a|BACKGROUND: In addition to the analgesic effect, peripheral neural blocks also prevent cognitive impairment and peripheral inflammation induced by surgery. However, it is unknown if there is collateral impact on cognitive improvement after bariatric surgery. METHODS: In this pilot study, 75 patients with severe obesity for selective laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) were recruited and randomized into three groups (1:1:1) as general anesthesia (GA) group, transverse abdominis plane block (TAPB) group, and quadratus lumborum block (QLB) group. Bilateral TAPB or QLB was performed (0.33% ropivacaine with dexmedetomidine 1 mug/kg) before the standardized general anesthesia. Cognitive test battery was completed before LSG and in 1-month and 3-month follow-up. The levels of peripheral inflammatory cytokines were determined at equivalent time points. RESULTS: Patients with LSG exhibited massive cognitive improvement in postoperative 3 month without or with TAPB or QLB (Ptime < 0.001). Compared to GA, QLB significantly strengthened performance in MoCA (beta = 0.56, 95%CI: 0.08, 1.05). IL-6, IL-8, and high-sensitivity CRP significantly verified among three groups. Changes in IL-6 within postoperative 3 months were negatively correlated with MMSE and MoCA, and positively correlated with AVLT-DR for QLB group. Similar correlation was found in the GA group for changes in IL-6 and AVLT-IR. CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy ideally improved memory and attention as early as postoperative 1 month. QLB promoted cognitive improvement in MoCA, which was negatively correlated with changes in IL-6. More precise trials are needed to determine the overall effect of peripheral neural block on cognition following bariatric surgery.
