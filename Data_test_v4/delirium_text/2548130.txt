2548130|t|The presence of tau distinguishes Lewy bodies of diffuse Lewy body disease from those of idiopathic Parkinson disease.
2548130|a|The antigenic components of Lewy bodies in the cerebral cortex and substantia nigra in 5 cases of diffuse Lewy body disease were examined by immunocytochemistry, using antibodies to neurofilaments (in the phosphorylated or non-phosphorylated forms); to ubiquitin; to the microtubule-associated proteins MAP1, MAP2 and tau; to isolated Alzheimer paired helical filaments, and to tubulin, in the tyrosinated and non-tyrosinated forms. Immunoreactivity with antibodies to cytoskeletal components was identical to that previously described for Lewy bodies of idiopathic Parkinson disease, with the exception that the inclusions of diffuse Lewy body disease (in both cortex and substantia nigra) were stained by an antibody to tau protein. Our findings indicate that although the inclusions found in diffuse Lewy body disease share structural and epitopic features with the inclusions of idiopathic Parkinson disease, they also have distinguishing characteristics (in addition to the differing neuronal populations involved). Also, they suggest that although the inclusions in both conditions appear similar, they probably have different pathogenetic origins.
