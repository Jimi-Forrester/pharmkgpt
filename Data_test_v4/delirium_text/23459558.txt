23459558|t|Role of autophagy in prion protein-induced neurodegenerative diseases.
23459558|a|Prion diseases, characterized by spongiform degeneration and the accumulation of misfolded and aggregated PrP(Sc) in the central nervous system, are one of fatal neurodegenerative and infectious disorders of humans and animals. In earlier studies, autophagy vacuoles in neurons were frequently observed in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's diseases as well as prion diseases. Autophagy is a highly conserved homeostatic process by which several cytoplasmic components (proteins or organelles) are sequestered in a double-membrane-bound vesicle termed 'autophagosome' and degraded upon their fusion with lysosome. The pathway of intercellular self-digestion at basal physiological levels is indispensable for maintaining the healthy status of tissues and organs. In case of prion infection, increasing evidence indicates that autophagy has a crucial ability of eliminating pathological PrP(Sc) accumulated within neurons. In contrast, autophagy dysfunction in affected neurons may contribute to the formation of spongiform changes. In this review, we summarized recent findings about the effect of mammalian autophagy in neurodegenerative disorders, particularly in prion diseases. We also summarized the therapeutic potential of some small molecules (such as lithium, rapamycin, Sirtuin 1 and resveratrol) targets to mitigate such diseases on brain function. Furthermore, we discussed the controversial role of autophagy, whether it mediates neuronal toxicity or serves a protective function in neurodegenerative disorders.
