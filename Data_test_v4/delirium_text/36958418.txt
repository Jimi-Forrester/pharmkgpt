36958418|a|The molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease (PD), and Huntington's disease remain enigmatic, resulting in an unmet need for therapeutics development. Here, we suggest that filbertone, a key flavor compound found in the fruits of hazel trees of the genus Corylus, can ameliorate PD via lowering the abundance of aggregated alpha-synuclein. We previously reported that inhibition of hypothalamic inflammation by filbertone is mediated by suppression of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kappaB). Here, we report that filbertone activates PERK through mitochondrial ROS (mtROS) production, resulting in the increased nuclear translocation of transcription factor-EB (TFEB) in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells. TFEB activation by filbertone promotes the autophagy-lysosomal pathway (ALP), which in turn alleviates the accumulation of alpha-synuclein. We also demonstrate that filbertone prevented the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and striatum of mice on high-fat diet (HFD). Filbertone treatment also reduced HFD-induced alpha-synuclein accumulation through upregulation of the ALP pathway. In addition, filbertone improved behavioral abnormalities (i.e., latency time to fall and decrease of running distance) in the MPTP-induced PD murine model. In conclusion, filbertone may show promise as a potential therapeutic for neurodegenerative disease.
