30263603|a|The preventive effects of Artemisia scoparia extract (AS) and AS + garlic extract (ASG) on the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) were evaluated in spontaneously hypertensive rats. Rats were supplemented with diets containing 2% (w/w) of AS or ASG for 6 weeks. The AS group showed lower levels of amyloid beta and beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 expressions and higher expression levels of low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 than did the control group (p < 0.05). In addition, the AS showed remarkably reduced levels of phosphorylated tau proteins and suppressed expression of phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase 3beta at tyrosine 216 (active form) (p < 0.05). The ASG group also suppressed amyloid beta accumulation and tau hyperphosphorylation. However, there was no synergistic effect of garlic with AS in lowering the risk of AD. These results indicate that AS could be a potential candidate to ameliorate the risk of AD.
