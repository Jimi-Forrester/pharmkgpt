29567428|t|Synthesis, molecular modelling and biological evaluation of tetrasubstituted thiazoles towards cholinesterase enzymes and cytotoxicity studies.
29567428|a|Alzheimer is a neurodegenerative disease and requires the development of new scaffold to treat it. In this regard, thiazoles derivative are playing their significant role. In the current research paper we have focused our attention for the development of tetrasubstituted thiazole (3a-h) derivatives using domino synthesis by mixing the thiourea as a precursor, with acetophenone in the presence of iodine and tosic acid in DMSO and refluxed for 12-22 h. The structures of the newly synthesized compounds were confirmed by FTIR, 1H NMR, 13C NMR and EIMS analysis. Thiazole derivatives were analyzed for their biological significances against acetyl and butylcholinesterase enzymes and compound 3b and 3d were found more active against these enzyme, respectively. The mode of inhibition was determined for the potent compounds against both the enzymes. Moreover, the molecular docking studies were carried out to explore the interactive behavior of the compounds within the active pocket of enzymes. Furthermore, the derivatives (3a-h) were evaluated for their anticancer potential against HeLa cancer cell lines. Most potent inhibition was observed by compound 3b.
