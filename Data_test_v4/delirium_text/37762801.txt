37762801|t|Multimorbidity Patterns in the Urban Population in Poland.
37762801|a|A number of studies have been conducted on multimorbidity; however, there are different patterns in various countries, ethnicities and social groups. The aim of this study is to estimate the prevalence of multimorbidity (physical diseases) in the urban population in Poland. In this population-based study, we examined multimorbidity stratified by sex, age, educational attainment and professional activity. Sixty-seven conditions were identified based on self-reported history (known conditions) and completed examinations (unknown conditions). Among the overall individuals aged 20-80 years, 1422 (88.2%) of the total 1612 individuals, 787 (88.9%) of 885 women and 635 (87.3%) of 727 men were diagnosed with at least two chronic conditions. On average, 5.25 +- 3.5 conditions occurred in the study population. The number of diagnosed conditions per individual increased with age and decreased with higher educational levels, with differing pathways in women and men. Women showed a higher number of conditions than men in the same age groups and educational levels. Only among students, the level of multimorbidity was lower in women than in men. In the other occupational activity categories, it was already higher in women. The level of multimorbidity in employed and unemployed individuals in a particular sex cluster was similar. We identified a high prevalence of multimorbidity in the urban population in Poland varying by age, sex, education attainment and professional activity. Our work may help in the selection of appropriate screening tests based on age, sex and educational attainment in order to recognise multimorbidity based on both known and unknown conditions. Ultimately, it may impact clinical practice, service delivery and study design.
