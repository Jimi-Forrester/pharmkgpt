32450995|t|The effects of stress on cardiovascular disease and Alzheimer's disease: Physical exercise as a counteract measure.
32450995|a|AD is a complicated multi-systemic neurological disorder that involves different biological pathways. Several risk factors have been identified, including chronic stress. Chronic stress produces an alteration in the activity of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) system, and the autonomic nervous system (ANS), which over time increase the risk of AD and also the incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and risk factors, such as hypertension, obesity and type 2 diabetes, associated with cognitive impairment and AD. Considering the multi-factorial etiology of AD, understanding the complex interrelationships between different risk factors is of potential interest for designing adequate strategies for preventing, delaying the onset or slowing down the progression of this devastating disease. Thus, in this review we will explore the general mechanisms and evidence linking stress, cardiovascular disease and AD, and discuss the potential benefits of physical activity for AD by counteracting the negative effects of chronic stress, CVD and risk factors.
