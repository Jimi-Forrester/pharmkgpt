38058491|t|Brain apolipoprotein E levels in mice challenged by a Western diet increase in an allele-dependent manner.
38058491|a|Human apolipoprotein E (APOE) is the greatest determinant of genetic risk for memory deficits and Alzheimer's disease (AD). While APOE4 drives memory loss and high AD risk, APOE2 leads to healthy brain aging and reduced AD risk compared to the common APOE3 variant. We examined brain APOE protein levels in humanized mice homozygous for these alleles and found baseline levels to be age- and isoform-dependent: APOE2 levels were greater than APOE3, which were greater than APOE4. Despite the understanding that APOE lipoparticles do not traverse the blood-brain barrier, we show that brain APOE levels are responsive to dietary fat intake. Challenging mice for 6 months on a Western diet high in fat and cholesterol increased APOE protein levels in an allele-dependent fashion with a much greater increase within blood plasma than within the brain. In the brain, APOE2 levels responded most to the Western diet challenge, increasing by 20 % to 30 %. While increased lipoparticles are generally deleterious in the periphery, we propose that higher brain APOE2 levels may represent a readily available pool of beneficial lipid particles for neurons.
