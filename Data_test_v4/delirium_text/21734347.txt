21734347|t|Statins: the role in the treatment and prevention of Alzheimer's neurodegeneration.
21734347|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease commonly seen in the elderly and is characterized by progressive cognitive and physical decline. Current understanding of AD pathogenesis revolves around amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta), a product of the sequential proteolytic cleavage of the transmembrane amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP) by beta- and gamma-secretase, enzymes found predominantly in the cholesterol rich micro domains of the cell membrane. Several risk factors for AD are associated with cholesterol metabolism, including dyslipidaemia, coronary artery and cerebrovascular disease. Statins are widely prescribed for their cholesterol lowering ability and show a favorable side effect profile overall. By competitive inhibition of hydroxymethyl co-enzyme A-reductase, statins reduce the production of cholesterol and isoprenoid intermediates including geranylgeranyl and farnesyl pyrophosphate. These isoprenoids modify recently translated proteins such as small GTPase molecules that are essential in numerous cell-signaling pathways, including vesicular trafficking and inflammation. In experimental models of AD, statins reduce the production of Abeta by disrupting secretase enzyme function and by reducing neuroinflammation. Furthermore, epidemiological studies suggest that statins may reduce the incidence of AD. Consequently, statins, secondary of their anti-hypercholesterolaemic, plieotropic and anti-inflammatory effects, are being investigated for a potential therapeutic role. This review will discuss evidence for the role of statins in the treatment and prevention of AD neurodegeneration.
