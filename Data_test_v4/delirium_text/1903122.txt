1903122|t|A checklist for managing the dementia patient.
1903122|a|Primary care physicians seeing a growing number of elderly demented patients must consider a number of problem areas when treating such patients. This article offers the mnemonic FICS'M (Family, Intellectual status, Continence, Sleep, and Mobility) to help physicians address treatable problems associated with dementing illnesses. Strategies are offered to minimize morbidity from the particular problem and from the treatment, such as trying "low toxicity" therapies and medications with few side effects. Other medical, ethical, and legal issues are discussed, including handling dangerous behaviors and abuse, nursing home placement and autopsy, and specific treatment of both the dementia itself and associated disorders--agitation, depression, and delirium.
