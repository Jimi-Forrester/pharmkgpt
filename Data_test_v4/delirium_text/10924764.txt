10924764|a|We have previously shown that Alzheimer disease (AD) brain exhibits terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) for DNA damage and morphological evidence for apoptosis. Down syndrome (DS) is a neurodegenerative disorder that exhibits significant neuropathological parallels with AD. In accordance with these parallels and the need to clarify the mechanism of cell death in DS and AD, we investigated two principal issues in the present study. First, we investigated the hypothesis that TUNEL labeling for DNA damage and morphological evidence for apoptosis is also present in the DS brain. All DS cases employed had a neuropathological diagnosis of AD. Analysis of these cases showed that DS brain exhibits a significant increase in the number of TUNEL-labeled nuclei relative to controls matched for age, Postmortem Delay, and Archival Length, and that a subset of TUNEL-positive nuclei exhibits apoptotic morphologies. We also report that Archival Length in 10% formalin can significantly affect TUNEL labeling in postmortem human brain, and therefore, that Archival Length must be controlled for as a variable in this type of study. Second, we investigated whether biochemical evidence for the mechanism of cell death in DS and AD could be detected. To address this question we employed pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) as a sensitive method to evaluate DNA integrity. Although apoptotic oligonucleosomal laddering has not previously been observed in AD, PFGE of DNA from control, DS and AD brain in the present study revealed evidence of high molecular weight DNA fragmentation indicative of apoptosis. This represents biochemical support for an apoptotic mechanism of cell death in DS and AD.
