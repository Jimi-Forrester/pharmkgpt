1893186|t|[Study of anti-amnesic activity of amiridin in a model of amnesic syndrome].
1893186|a|The model of amnestic syndrome obtained by treatment with scopolamine during 20 days in rats was used to study anti-amnesic activity of amiridin in comparison with that of tacrine, physostigmine and piracetam. Multiple injection of Sc resulted in significant deterioration of rats, performance in passive avoidance test. Behavioral disorders were accompanied by such changes in lipid composition of brain synaptosomes which indicated a decreased membrane fluidity. Amiridin and tacrine as well as piracetam showed anti-amnesic action which in the course of treatment correlated with their normalizing effect on lipid content of synaptosomes. The diverse effect of amiridin and tacrine with respect to physostigmine implies that the former drugs can't be attributed to anticholinesterase preparations which are traditionally used in the treatment of Alzheimer disease.
