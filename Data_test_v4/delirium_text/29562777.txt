29562777|t|Placenta-Derived Adherent Stromal Cell Therapy for Hematopoietic Disorders: A Case Study of PLX-R18.
29562777|a|The ephemeral placenta provides a noncontroversial source of young, healthy cells of both maternal and fetal origin from which cell therapy products can be manufactured. The 2 advantages of using live cells as therapeutic entities are: (a) in their environmental-responsive, multifactorial secretion profile and (b) in their activity as a "slow-release drug delivery system," releasing secretions over a long time frame. A major difficulty in translating cell therapy to the clinic involves challenges of large-scale, robust manufacturing while maintaining product characteristics, identity, and efficacy. To address these concerns early on, Pluristem developed the PLacental eXpanded (PLX) platform, the first good manufacturing practice-approved, 3-dimensional bioreactor-based cell growth platform, to enable culture of mesenchymal-like adherent stromal cells harvested from the postpartum placenta. One of the products produced by Pluristem on this platform is PLX-R18, a product mainly comprising placental fetal cells, which is proven in vivo to alleviate radiation-induced lethality and to enhance hematopoietic cell counts after bone marrow (BM) failure. The identified mechanism of action of PLX-R18 cells is one of the cell-derived systemic pro-hematopoietic secretions, which upregulate endogenous secretions and subsequently rescue BM and peripheral blood cellularity, thereby boosting survival. PLX-R18 is therefore currently under study to treat both the hematopoietic syndrome of acute radiation (under the US Food and Drug Administration [FDA]'s Animal Rule) and the incomplete engraftment after BM transplantation (in a phase I study). In the future, they could potentially address additional hematological indications, such as aplastic anemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, primary graft failure, and acute or chronic graft versus host disease.
