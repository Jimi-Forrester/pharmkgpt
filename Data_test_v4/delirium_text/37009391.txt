37009391|a|Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a highly effective treatment option among the biological treatments introduced in psychiatry. It has been used successfully to treat neurological conditions such as epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, and major psychiatric disorders. Non-convulsive status epilepticus can be seen as a complication after ECT, although it rarely occurs. Due to its rarity, this complication is not yet well understood, is challenging to diagnose, and information about treatment options is limited. Here, we present a 29-year-old patient with no previous neurological disease and a history of schizophrenia and refractory psychosis on clozapine; nonconvulsive status epilepticus was detected in the EEG after ECT.
