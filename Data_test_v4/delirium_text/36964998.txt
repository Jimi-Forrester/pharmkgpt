36964998|a|AIMS: Oxygen therapy plays a vital role in the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), which is the independent risk factor for neurodevelopment deficits in premature infants. However, the effect of hippocampal cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) on BPD-associated neurodevelopment deficits is not fully understood. METHODS: Mice were placed in a hyperoxia chamber from postnatal Day 1 to Day 7. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was used to evaluate the lung histomorphological characteristics. Learning and memory functions of mice were detected by Morris water maze. TUNEL staining was applied to measure the number of apoptotic cells. The expression of CDK5, apoptosis-related protein, and neuroplasticity-related proteins were analyzed by Western blot. Golgi staining was used to assess the structure of dendritic spines. RESULTS: Hyperoxia-induced BPD mice showed a long-term learning and memory dysfunction, more severe neuronal apoptosis, and a decline of synaptic plasticity. Inhibition of CDK5 overactivation ameliorated cognitive deficits, neuronal apoptosis, and synaptic plasticity disorders in BPD mice. CONCLUSIONS: This study first found a vital role of CDK5 in BPD-associated neurodevelopmental disorders. Inhibition of CDK5 overexpression could effectively improve cognitive dysfunctions in BPD mice, which indicated that hippocampal CDK5 may be a new target for prevention and treatment in learning and memory dysfunction of BPD.
