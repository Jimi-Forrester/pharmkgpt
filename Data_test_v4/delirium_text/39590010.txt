39590010|t|Innovative Peptide-Based Plasmonic Optical Biosensor for the Determination of Cholesterol.
39590010|a|Plasmonic-based biosensors have gained prominence as potent optical biosensing platforms in both scientific and medical research, attributable to their enhanced sensitivity and precision in detecting biomolecular and chemical interactions. However, the detection of low molecular weight analytes with high sensitivity and specificity remains a complex and unresolved issue, posing significant limitations for the advancement of clinical diagnostic tools and medical device technologies. Notably, abnormal cholesterol levels are a well-established indicator of various pathological conditions; yet, the quantitative detection of the free form of cholesterol is complicated by its small molecular size, pronounced hydrophobicity, and the necessity for mediator molecules to achieve efficient sensing. In the present study, a novel strategy for cholesterol quantification was developed, leveraging a plasmonic optical readout in conjunction with a highly specific cholesterol-binding peptide (C-pept) as a biorecognition element, anchored on a functionalized silica substrate. The resulting biosensor exhibited an exceptionally low detection limit of 21.95 microM and demonstrated a linear response in the 10-200 microM range. This peptide-integrated plasmonic sensor introduces a novel one-step competitive method for cholesterol quantification, positioning itself as a highly sensitive biosensing modality for implementation within the AVAC platform, which operates using reflective dark-field microscopy.
