28733707|a|Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are one of the most frequently recommended antihypertensive drugs. Apart from their activity towards the circulatory system, ARBs also penetrate the blood-brain barrier and display neuroprotective effects. Kynurenic acid (KYNA) is an endogenous metabolite of tryptophan produced by kynurenine aminotransferase II (KAT II) in the brain. Antagonism towards all ionotropic glutamate (GLU) receptors is the main mechanism of KYNA action. An elevated brain level of KYNA is linked with memory impairment and psychotic symptoms. The aim of this study was to examine the influence of three ARBs: irbesartan, losartan, and telmisartan on KYNA production and KAT II activity in rat brain. The effect of ARBs on KYNA production was analyzed in rat brain cortical slices and on isolated KAT II enzyme. Irbesartan, losartan, and telmisartan decreased KYNA production and KAT II activity in a dose-dependent manner in rat brain cortex in vitro. Molecular docking suggested that the examined ARBs could bind to an active site of KAT II. In conclusion, ARBs decrease KYNA production in rat brain by direct inhibition of KAT II enzymatic activity. This novel mechanism of ARBs action may be advantageous in the treatment of cognitive impairment or the management of schizophrenia.
