32707914|t|From Riluzole to Dexpramipexole via Substituted-Benzothiazole Derivatives for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Disease Treatment: Case Studies.
32707914|a|The 1,3-benzothiazole (BTZ) ring may offer a valid option for scaffold-hopping from indole derivatives. Several BTZs have clinically relevant roles, mainly as CNS medicines and diagnostic agents, with riluzole being one of the most famous examples. Riluzole is currently the only approved drug to treat amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) but its efficacy is marginal. Several clinical studies have demonstrated only limited improvements in survival, without benefits to motor function in patients with ALS. Despite significant clinical trial efforts to understand the genetic, epigenetic, and molecular pathways linked to ALS pathophysiology, therapeutic translation has remained disappointingly slow, probably due to the complexity and the heterogeneity of this disease. Many other drugs to tackle ALS have been tested for 20 years without any success. Dexpramipexole is a BTZ structural analog of riluzole and was a great hope for the treatment of ALS. In this review, as an interesting case study in the development of a new medicine to treat ALS, we present the strategy of the development of dexpramipexole, which was one of the most promising drugs against ALS.
