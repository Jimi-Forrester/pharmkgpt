1521848|a|This paper examines the effectiveness of a nursing intervention for elderly hospitalized patients (N = 235) as measured by functional outcomes. A nursing intervention targeted at factors which influence acute confusion or delirium employed strategies to educate nursing staff, mobilize patients, monitor medication and make environmental and sensory modifications. Subjects who received the intervention were more likely to improve in functional status from admission to discharge than subjects who did not receive the intervention.
