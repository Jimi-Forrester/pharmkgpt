25098029|a|OBJECTIVE: To examine key aspects of neurologists' and psychiatrists' views and approaches regarding prenatal genetic testing (GT) and preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD). STUDY DESIGN: We surveyed attitudes and practices among 163 neurologists and 372 psychiatrists. RESULTS: A total of 24.9% of neurologists and 31.9% of psychiatrists had discussed prenatal GT with patients, but 95.3% did not feel comfortable discussing PGD; only 2.9% discussed it, and only 1.8% had patients ask about PGD. Most would refer for PGD for Huntington's disease and Tay-Sachs disease, fewer for cystic fibrosis, and fewer still for autism, Alzheimer's disease, or gender selection for family balancing; in each of these cases, psychiatrists' percentages were higher than those of neurologists. Providers who would refer for PGD for Huntington's disease, cystic fibrosis, or gender selection differed from others in proportions of patients with insurance and were more likely to have undergone a GT themselves and be concerned about discrimination. CONCLUSION: These data, the first to examine how neurologists and psychiatrists view PGD, suggest that they do not feel comfortable discussing PGD but have strong views about its use. Potential PGD use is associated with concerns about discrimination and less experience with GT. These data highlight the need for enhancing education about these technologies among various providers.
