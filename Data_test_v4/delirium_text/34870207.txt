34870207|t|Progression of Cognitive Impairment to Alzheimer's Disease: Through the Lens of Salivary Extracellular Vesicles.
34870207|a|The elusiveness encircling around the domain of cognition, its impairment, and the poor prognosis of Alzheimer's disease has made early diagnosis a necessity. The noticeable symptoms in these conditions appear years later after the neuropathological changes occur in the brain. Exosomes, a small-sized extracellular vesicle facilitate intercellular communication of disease pathologies and their cargo can provide molecular information about its place of origin. The study titled "A novel approach to correlate the salivary exosomes and their protein cargo in the progression of cognitive impairment into Alzheimer's disease" was an attempt toward understanding the role of salivary small-sized extracellular vesicular (EV's) cargo in monitoring the progression. Outcomes of the study represent, that the salivary small-sized EV's (ssEV's) levels were higher in the cognitively impaired and Alzheimer's diseased as well the differential expression of the protein in the cargo correlates well with the disease severity staging. Thus, it can help in the development of an early non-invasive screening method.
