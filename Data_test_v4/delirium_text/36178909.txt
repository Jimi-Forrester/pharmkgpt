36178909|t|Hypotension after general anesthesia induction using remimazolam in geriatric patients: Protocol for a double-blind randomized controlled trial.
36178909|a|INTRODUCTION: In geriatric patients, hypotension is often reported after general anesthesia induction using propofol. Remimazolam is a novel short-acting sedative. However, the incidence of hypotension after general anesthesia induction using remimazolam in geriatric patients remains unclear. This study aims to compare the incidence of hypotension associated with remimazolam and propofol in patients aged >=80 years. METHODS: This single-center, double-blind, randomized, two-arm parallel group, standard treatment-controlled, interventional clinical trial will include 90 patients aged >=80 years undergoing elective surgery under general anesthesia who will be randomized to receive remimazolam or propofol for induction. The primary outcome is the incidence of hypotension after general anesthesia induction, occurring between the start of drug administration and 3 min after intubation. We define hypotension as mean blood pressure <65 mmHg. The primary outcome will be analyzed using the full analysis set. The incidence of hypotension in the two groups will be compared using the Mantel-Haenszel chi2 test. Subgroup analysis of the primary outcome will be performed based on the Charlson comorbidity index, clinical frailty scale, hypertension in the ward, and age. Secondary outcomes will be analyzed using the Fisher's exact test, Student's t test, and Mann-Whitney U test, as appropriate. Logistic regression analysis will be performed to explore the factors associated with the incidence of hypotension after anesthesia induction. DISCUSSION: Our trial will determine the efficacy of remimazolam in preventing hypotension and provide evidence on the usefulness of remimazolam for ensuring hemodynamic stability during general anesthesia induction in geriatric patients. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study has been registered with UMIN Clinical Trials Registry (UMIN000042587), on June 30, 2021.
