9202938|a|From the patient's point of view, the Intensive Care Unit is both a frightening place and a safe haven. Psychologically, what we see most commonly are regression, delirium and paranola. Regression requires no treatment; delirium is treatable not only medically but psychologically as well; paranoia is best treated by prevention.
