39321453|t|Ascertaining Out-of-Pocket Costs of Dementia Care: Feasibility Study of a Web-Based Weekly Survey.
39321453|a|BACKGROUND: Caring for a family member living with dementia is costly. A major contributor to care demands, and therefore to the costs, are the behavioral symptoms of dementia. Here, we examine the feasibility of ascertaining costs related to caregiving from weekly web-based surveys collected during a telehealth-based behavioral intervention study-Support via Technology: Living and Learning with Advancing Alzheimer Disease. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to determine the feasibility and acceptability of using a web-based weekly survey to capture real-time data on out-of-pocket caregiving expenses and time commitments associated with dementia care. To examine relationships between behavioral symptoms, care partner reactivity, burden, and out-of-pocket dementia care costs. METHODS: Feasibility was measured by accrual, retention, and data completion by participating care partners. Behavioral symptoms, care partner reactivity, and burden were collected before and after the intervention from 13 care partners. Weekly web-based surveys queried Support via Technology: Living and Learning with Advancing Alzheimer Disease care partners about their out-of-pocket costs associated with care-related activities. The surveys included questions on out-of-pocket costs care partners incurred from hospitalizations and emergency department use, primary care provider visits, use of paid in-home care or respite services, use of prescription medications, and use of over-the-counter medications. The surveys also queried the amount of time care partners devoted to these specific care-related activities. RESULTS: Out-of-pocket costs of dementia care were collected via a web-based weekly survey for up to 18 months. In-home assistance was the most frequently reported type of out-of-pocket care expense and the costliest. care partners who paid for in-home assistance or respite reported more behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia behaviors, higher reactivity, and higher burden than those who did not. CONCLUSIONS: This novel web-based weekly survey-based approach offers lessons for designing and implementing future cost-focused studies and care partner-supportive telehealth-based interventions for Alzheimer disease and related dementias (ADRD). The results correspond with the existing understanding of ADRD in that high family-related out-of-pocket costs are a typical part of the caregiving experience, and those costs likely increase with dementia severity. The results may also offer potential insights to health systems and policy makers as they seek to implement telehealth-based and related interventions that seek to better support people living with ADRD and their family care partners.
