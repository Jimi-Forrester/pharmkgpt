11795357|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible, progressive brain disorder that occurs gradually and results in memory loss, behavior and personality changes, and a decline in cognitive abilities. Although basic biological data suggest that estrogen may have neuroprotective and neuroenhancing functions, a number of studies have produced conflicting findings on the use of estrogen for maintaining cognitive function in older people. This review summarizes clinical studies that have examined the effects of estrogen in women with AD.
