22161584|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is accompanied by oxidative stress in the brain. Because the brain tissue is rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids, it is prone to the free radical attack resulting in lipid peroxidation. Intermediates of lipid peroxidation may diffuse from the primary site, cross the blood-brain barrier and modify erythrocyte membranes in the bloodstream. We exposed isolated erythrocyte membranes from patients with AD and the control group to in vitro free radical damage and monitored the accumulation of the end products of lipid peroxidation, lipofuscin-like pigments (LFPs), by fluorescence spectroscopy. LFPs were analyzed by means of tridimensional and synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy. The levels of LFP formed during in vitro peroxidation were significantly higher in erythrocyte membranes from patients with AD compared with the control group. Furthermore, the chemical composition of LFP in AD was different from the control group. The analysis of the specific modifications of erythrocyte membranes in AD is of great medical importance regarding the need of a diagnostic blood biomarker.
