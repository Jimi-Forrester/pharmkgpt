39763175|t|Visualizing Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress and Autophagy in Alzheimer's Model Cells by a Peroxynitrite-Responsive AIEgen Fluorescent Probe.
39763175|a|Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and autophagy (ER-phagy) occurring in nerve cells are crucial physiological processes closely associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Visualizing the two processes is paramount to advance our understanding of AD pathologies. Among the biomarkers identified, peroxynitrite (ONOO-) emerges as a key molecule in the initiation and aggravation of ER stress and ER-phagy, highlighting its significance in the underlying mechanisms of the two processes. In this work, we designed and synthesized an innovative ONOO--responsive AIEgen-based fluorescent probe (DHQM) with the ability to monitor ER stress and ER-phagy in AD model cells. DHQM demonstrated excellent aggregation-induced emission (AIE) properties, endowing it with outstanding ability for washing-free intracellular imaging. Meanwhile, it exhibited high sensitivity, remarkable selectivity to ONOO-, and exceptional ER-targeting ability. The probe was successfully applied for fluorescence imaging of ER ONOO- fluctuations to assess the ER stress status in aluminum-induced AD model cells. Our findings revealed that aluminum-induced ferroptosis, a regulated cell death process, was pivotal in the excessive ONOO- production, which in turn activated and exacerbated ER stress. Furthermore, the aluminum-stimulated ER-phagy was observed utilizing DHQM, which might be crucial in inhibiting ferroptosis and mitigating aberrant ER stress. Overall, this study not only offers valuable insights into the pathological mechanisms of AD at the ER level but also opens new potential therapeutic avenues targeting these pathways.
