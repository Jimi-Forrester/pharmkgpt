32326620|t|Neuroprotective Properties of Resveratrol and Its Derivatives-Influence on Potential Mechanisms Leading to the Development of Alzheimer's Disease.
32326620|a|The lack of effective Alzheimer's disease treatment is becoming a challenge for researchers and prompts numerous attempts to search for and develop better therapeutic solutions. Compounds that affect several routes of the neurodegeneration cascade leading to the development of disease are of particular interest. An example of such substances is resveratrol and its synthetic and natural derivatives, which have gained popularity in recent years and show promise as a possible new therapeutic option in the approach to Alzheimer's disease treatment. In this article, the state of the art evidence on the role of resveratrol (RSV) in neuroprotection is presented; research results are summarized and the importance of resveratrol and its derivatives in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease are underlined. It also focuses on various modifications of the resveratrol molecule that should be taken into account in the design of future research on drugs against Alzheimer's disease.
