37742638|t|The Complexity of Nutritional Problems in Persons with Dementia: Expanding a Theoretical Model.
37742638|a|BACKGROUND: Persons with dementia are at risk of developing nutritional problems. Theoretical models on nutritional problems have been developed, but have not been evaluated with healthcare professionals. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the comprehensiveness and applicability of a theoretical model of nutritional problems in persons with dementia for daily nursing home practice. METHODS: A qualitative design employing a combined deductive and inductive approach was used. Healthcare professionals were eligible to participate if they 1) had expert knowledge of and experience with nutritional problems related to dementia, and 2) worked in a nursing home affiliated with an academic network covering the east and south of the Netherlands. Three focus group interviews with 20 healthcare professionals from seven professions were held. We conducted thematic analysis and we compared themes with existing theoretical models from the literature. RESULTS: We identified six themes, four of which corresponded with the existing models (observing and analysing nutritional problems; consequences of nutritional problems; functioning of the person with dementia; environmental factors). Interprofessional collaboration and ethical factors were identified as new themes. The analyses indicated interactions within each theme, between themes, and a bidirectional connection between themes. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated the relevance of interprofessional collaboration and ethical considerations in nutritional problems related to dementia. It uncovered complex bidirectional relations within and between factors regarding nutritional problems. All aspects should be taken into account to minimize the consequences of nutritional problems for persons with dementia.
