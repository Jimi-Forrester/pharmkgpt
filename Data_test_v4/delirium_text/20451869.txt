20451869|a|Functions of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) core fall into three categories: (1) those of the central MRI core laboratory at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, needed to generate high quality MRI data in all subjects at each time point; (2) those of the funded ADNI MRI core imaging analysis groups responsible for analyzing the MRI data; and (3) the joint function of the entire MRI core in designing and problem solving MR image acquisition, pre-processing, and analyses methods. The primary objective of ADNI was and continues to be improving methods for clinical trials in Alzheimer's disease. Our approach to the present ("ADNI-GO") and future ("ADNI-2," if funded) MRI protocol will be to maintain MRI methodological consistency in the previously enrolled "ADNI-1" subjects who are followed up longitudinally in ADNI-GO and ADNI-2. We will modernize and expand the MRI protocol for all newly enrolled ADNI-GO and ADNI-2 subjects. All newly enrolled subjects will be scanned at 3T with a core set of three sequence types: 3D T1-weighted volume, FLAIR, and a long TE gradient echo volumetric acquisition for micro hemorrhage detection. In addition to this core ADNI-GO and ADNI-2 protocol, we will perform vendor-specific pilot sub-studies of arterial spin-labeling perfusion, resting state functional connectivity, and diffusion tensor imaging. One of these sequences will be added to the core protocol on systems from each MRI vendor. These experimental sub-studies are designed to demonstrate the feasibility of acquiring useful data in a multicenter (but single vendor) setting for these three emerging MRI applications.
