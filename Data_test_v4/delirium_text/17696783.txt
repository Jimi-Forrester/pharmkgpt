17696783|a|Beta-secretase inhibitors that lower brain beta-amyloid peptides (Abeta) are likely to be effective for treating Alzheimer's disease (AD). Irreversible epoxysuccinyl cysteine protease inhibitors are known to reduce brain Abeta and beta-secretase activity in the guinea pig model of human Abeta production. In this study, acetyl-L-leucyl-L-valyl-L-lysinal (Ac-LVK-CHO) is also shown to significantly reduce brain Abeta and beta-secretase activity and brain Abeta in the same model. Ac-LVK-CHO is structurally distinct from the epoxysuccinyl inhibitors and is a reversible cysteine protease inhibitor. The results suggest that cysteine protease inhibitors generally, and reversible cysteine protease inhibitors specifically, have potential for development as AD therapeutics.
