35615741|a|Patients with neurocysticercosis, a common infection of the central nervous system caused by Taenia solium, have been reported to develop neuropsychiatric complications. We report a unique case of recurrent psychosis caused by neurocysticercosis in a 37-year-old El Salvador immigrant woman and discuss the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of the complications. We reviewed published case reports of neurocysticercosis that presented with psychotic features and compared their diagnostic evaluation, the underlying pathophysiology of complications and treatment regimen with our case. This review concludes that neurocysticercosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with psychosis with a history of residence in an endemic area.
