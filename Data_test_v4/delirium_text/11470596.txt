11470596|t|From symptomatic treatments to causative therapy?
11470596|a|The search for genes that predispose individuals to develop common chronic diseases such as asthma, diabetes and Alzheimer's promises to give insights into their molecular pathogenesis. This will lead to the development of therapies that modulate the pathology, rather than the physiology of these diseases. As academia and the pharmaceutical industry increasingly focus on this challenge, the genetic dissection of Alzheimer's is spearheading attempts to shift the therapeutic paradigm away from symptomatic to curative treatments.
