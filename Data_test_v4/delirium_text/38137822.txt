38137822|t|The Role of Intraoperative and Early Postoperative Blood Pressure Variations, Fluid Balance and Inotropics in Fibula Free Flap Head and Neck Reconstruction: A Retrospective Analysis.
38137822|a|BACKGROUND: In head and neck reconstructive surgery, postoperative complications are a well-known concern. METHODS: We examined 46 patients who underwent ablative surgery and received fibula free flap reconstruction. The main focus was to assess the influence of intraoperative blood pressure fluctuations and the administration of inotropic drugs on complications, either related to the flap or systemic, serving as the primary endpoint. RESULTS: Utilizing logistic regression models, we identified that intraoperative mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) drops did not correlate with the occurrence of either flap-related complications (MAP < 70, p = 0.79; MAP < 65, p = 0.865; MAP < 60, p = 0.803; MAP < 55, p = 0.937) or systemic medical complications (MAP < 70, p = 0.559; MAP < 65, p = 0.396; MAP < 60, p = 0.211; MAP < 55, p = 0.936). The occurrence of flap-related complications significantly increased if a higher dosage of dobutamine was administered (median 27.5 (IQR 0-47.5) vs. 62 (38-109) mg, p = 0.019) but not if norepinephrine was administered (p = 0.493). This correlation was especially noticeable given the uptick in complications associated with fluid overload (3692 (3101-4388) vs. 4859 (3555-6216) mL, p = 0.026). CONCLUSION: Intraoperative and immediate postoperative blood pressure fluctuations are common but are not directly associated with flap-related complications; however, dobutamine application as well as fluid overload may impact flap-specific complications.
