35008961|t|LC3/FtMt Colocalization Patterns Reveal the Progression of FtMt Accumulation in Nigral Neurons of Patients with Progressive Supranuclear Palsy.
35008961|a|Mitochondrial ferritin (FtMt) is a mitochondrial iron storage protein associated with neurodegenerative diseases. In patients with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), FtMt was shown to accumulate in nigral neurons. Here, we investigated FtMt and LC3 in the post-mortem midbrain of PSP patients to reveal novel aspects of the pathology. Immunohistochemistry was used to assess the distribution and abnormal changes in FtMt and LC3 immunoreactivities. Colocalization analysis using double immunofluorescence was performed, and subcellular patterns were examined using 3D imaging and modeling. In the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), strong FtMt-IR and LC3-IR were observed in the neurons of PSP patients. In other midbrain regions, such as the superior colliculus, the FtMt-IR and LC3-IR remained unchanged. In the SNc, nigral neurons were categorized into four patterns based on subcellular LC3/FtMt immunofluorescence intensities, degree of colocalization, and subcellular overlapping. This categorization suggested that concomitant accumulation of LC3/FtMt is related to mitophagy processes. Using the LC3-IR to stage neuronal damage, we retraced LC3/FtMt patterns and revealed the progression of FtMt accumulation in nigral neurons. Informed by these findings, we proposed a hypothesis to explain the function of FtMt during PSP progression.
