26943237|a|DNA methylation is an important epigenetic mechanism for gene regulation and it is well established there is association between aging and DNA methylation. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease, characterized by amyloid plaque deposition and formation of neurofibrillary tangles. In this study, we examined the correlation between DNA methylation and gene expression of seven genes including CTSB, CTSD, DDT, TSC1, NRD1, UQCRC1 and NDUFA6 and its effect on the risk of AD in a Chinese population. Our finding showed significantly increased gene expression of these 7 genes in AD patients (2.7-fold-8.6-fold). UQCRC1 was highly methylated in AD patients and there was strong positive correlation between gene expression level and methylation status of UQCRC1 (p < 0.001). Further analysis showed the methylation status of UQCRC1 was significantly associated with gene expression of NRD1, DDT, CTSB and CTSD, suggested the regulatory mechanism on these 4 genes by UQCRC1. Our study further suggested the role of methylation in gene regulation and the role in AD.
