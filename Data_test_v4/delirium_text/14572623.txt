14572623|t|Autoantibodies to serotonin in serum of patients with psychiatric disorders.
14572623|a|Antibodies to serotonin in serum were investigated by ELISA in patients with paranoid schizophrenia (N=27), schizoaffective psychosis (N=38), depression (N=67), Alzheimer's disease (N=21), chronic alcoholism (N=43), rheumatoid arthritis (N=25), and multiple sclerosis (N=16), and in healthy volunteers (N=60). Increased antibody reactivity to serotonin was found in schizoaffective psychosis, chronic alcoholism, and rheumatoid arthritis. Decreased antibody reactivity to serotonin was found in multiple sclerosis and depression. These anti-serotonin antibodies belong to the class of so-called natural autoantibodies. Alterations of these natural autoantibodies could indicate a disturbance to the immune system. It is possible that these antibodies could also influence receptor function. Autoantibodies to neurotransmitters in a wide spectrum of psychiatric disorders have not previously been reported.
