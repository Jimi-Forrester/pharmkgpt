34523700|a|It has become clear that COVID-19 can lead to neuropsychiatric complications. In this article, three cases are discussed that illustrate how neuropsychiatric complications can manifest within the COVID-19 disease course. Patients are at risk to develop a severe, hyperactive delirium, which is often accompanied by anxiety and sometimes neurological symptoms. The treatment of the neuropsychiatric complications is characterized by unusually high doses of antipsychotics and sedatives. Timely psychiatric consultation is advised for adequate recognition and effective treatment of delirium and other neuropsychiatric symptoms.
