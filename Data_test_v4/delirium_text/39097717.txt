39097717|a|Cell death is one of the most important mechanisms of maintaining homeostasis in our body. Ferroptosis and pyroptosis are forms of necrosis-like cell death. These cell death modalities play key roles in the pathophysiology of cancer, cardiovascular, neurological diseases, and other pathologies. Transition metals are abundant group of elements in all living organisms. This paper presents a summary of ferroptosis and pyroptosis pathways and their connection to significant transition metals, namely zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), molybdenum (Mo), lead (Pb), cobalt (Co), iron (Fe), cadmium (Cd), nickel (Ni), mercury (Hg), uranium (U), platinum (Pt), and one crucial element, selenium (Se). Authors aim to summarize the up-to-date knowledge of this topic.In this review, there are categorized and highlighted the most common patterns in the alterations of ferroptosis and pyroptosis by transition metals. Special attention is given to zinc since collected data support its dual nature of action in both ferroptosis and pyroptosis. All findings are presented together with a brief description of major biochemical pathways involving mentioned metals and are visualized in attached comprehensive figures.This work concludes that the majority of disruptions in the studied metals' homeostasis impacts cell fate, influencing both death and survival of cells in the complex system of altered pathways. Therefore, this summary opens up the space for further research.
