1285994|t|[A case of Castleman's disease with a variable neuropsychiatric symptomatology].
1285994|a|A case of 44-year-old woman who had shown psychiatric symptoms before and during the course of Castlemans' disease was presented. For four years, she first suffered from a paranoid-hallucinatory state and then a depressive one episodically. In the course of the latter, severe anemia developed. She was diagnosed as Castleman's disease, because the increased serum level of gamma-globulin and interleukin-6 (IL-6), and multiple lymphomata were evidenced. A paranoid-hallucinatory state relapsed about one year later from this episode. At last, some bulbar and cerebellar symptoms, and a delirium suddenly occurred. The ischemic changes at the level of the pons and midbrain were revealed by the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination. It is certainly that both neurological and psychiatric symptoms were related to the lesions. This ischemic lesions may have resulted from the anoxia secondary to the severe anemia and/or hyperviscosity syndrome in the disease. On the other hand, the increased serum level of IL-6 as well as the ischemic lesions might have caused psychiatric symptoms in this case, as the interferone which is one of the analogues of IL-6, is known to induce emotional and behavioral symptoms.
