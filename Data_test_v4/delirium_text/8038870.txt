8038870|a|It has been shown recently that in Alzheimer's disease the degree of dementia is strongly correlated with a reduction of the synaptophysin reactivity of the cortical neuropil as a measure of synapse density, while counts of neuritic plaques showed a weak correlation. This suggests that mechanisms acting at the synaptic level, finally resulting in a numerical decline of synapses, may represent an important factor in the pathogenesis of dementia. Under these aspects, we wanted to examine whether changes of synaptophysin immunoreactivity may also occur in dementia of vascular origin such as Binswanger's disease, where the white matter atrophy is usually conceived to be the main morphologic correlate of dementia. However, infrequently patients with morphologically typical Binswanger's subcortical encephalopathy including white matter atrophy are not demented. We found in 9 cases of vascular dementia of Binswanger type a significant reduction in synaptophysin immunoreactivity of the cortical neuropil (9.1%), the magnitude of which was not much less than in Alzheimer type dementia (10.9%). These results suggest that a reduction in cortical synaptic population density may also play a significant role in the pathogenesis of dementia in Binswanger's disease. In view of the fact that similar conditions have been shown to occur in neurodegenerative disorders with dementia other than Alzheimer type dementia, there seems to be evidence for a possible common pathogenetic link between these forms of dementia at the synaptic level, where different etiologic factors may result in similar changes.
