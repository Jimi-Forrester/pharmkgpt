35301147|a|Photo-oxygenation has become an effective way to inhibit Alzheimer's beta-amyloid protein (Abeta) fibrillogenesis, which involves oxidative modification of Abeta by photo-oxidants. However, limitations of the current photo-oxidants, such as low biocompatibility and low affinity for Abeta, hinder the progression of the photo-oxygenation strategy. Herein, using human serum albumins (HSA) with binding affinity for Abeta as a platform, we have fabricated HSA-stabilized gold nanoclusters (AuNCs@HSA) and further modified the AuNCs@HSA with ethylenediamine to create basified HSA (HSA-B)-stabilized AuNCs. The basified composite, AuNCs@HSA-B, showed significantly higher potency on the inhibition of beta-amyloid formation and capability of reactive oxidative species generation than AuNCs@HSA. In addition to the inhibition effect, under near-infrared (NIR) laser irradiation, AuNCs@HSA-B generated singlet oxygen to oxygenate Abeta monomers, distinctly alleviating Abeta-mediated neurotoxicity at a low concentration. In vivo studies demonstrated that NIR-activated AuNCs@HSA-B promoted the lifespan extension of transgenic C. elegans strain CL2006 by decreasing the Abeta burden. This well-designed AuNCs@HSA-B integrates inhibition, Abeta targeting, and photo-oxygenation, providing new insights into the development of protein-based photo-oxidant against Alzheimer's beta-amyloid. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been threatening human health for more than 100 years. Recently, researchers have focused on inhibiting beta-amyloid protein (Abeta) aggregation by exploring photo-excited biomaterials, which enable modulation of Abeta fibrillization with high spatiotemporal controllability. The present work demonstrates the fabrication of basified human serum albumins (HSA-B)-stabilized gold nanoclusters (AuNCs@HSA-B), and shows the potential of this near-infrared (NIR) laser-activated AuNCs@HSA-B as a photo-oxidant against Abeta aggregation by photo-oxygenation. Our work should open a new horizon in the design of protein-based photo-oxidant for treating AD in the future.
