28670641|t|TICK INFESTATION: A 200-PATIENTS' SERIES.
28670641|a|BACKGROUND: A great number of zoonotic diseases with high mortality rate are transmitted by ticks. We performed this study in order to investigate patients admitted to emergency department following a tick bite. We examined the patients and get knowledge about the infestation and we followed up them for possible tick-conducted disease symptoms and laboratory findings both clinically and serologically. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study presented was hold for one year, between 01.01.2012 and 31.12.2012. 200 tick infested cases, admitted to Emergency Department of Haydarpasa Numune Training and Research Hospital, were subjected in the study. Demographic patterns of the patients and the region they come from, infested area on body, admission time and blood analyzing results were detected. RESULTS: Rate of adult patients to pediatric was 2:1; gender distribution was similar to each other. The most common body areas that ticks were removed from were lower extremity. The highest tick bite incidence was in summer and on weekends. No tick bite incident of Istanbul surrounding from the year 2012 progressed to a zoonotic disease. CONCLUSIONS: Although non-of the patients of our study has been diagnosed with Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever we informed all of them for the incubation period and call for observation during the time. Tick borne infections may present with vary of symptoms, the most sever of which is hemorrhagic diathesis and patients should be informed for the risks. Knowledge of local area fauna risks may guide physicians so studies on this topic are essential.
