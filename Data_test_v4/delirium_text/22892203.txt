22892203|a|INTRODUCTION: Infective endocarditis presenting with arthralgia is rare. Group B streptococcus tricuspid endocarditis as a postpartum complication is even rarer. The present case is an example of both. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 30-year-old Caucasian woman who presented with painful swelling of her wrists and ankles. CONCLUSION: Even when the clinical presentation of systemic inflammation is more suggestive of a primary rheumatological disorder, it is important to remember that bacterial infection can also present in this manner. Group B streptococcus tricuspid valve endocarditis is a rare, but recognized, postpartum complication.
