23039767|a|Amyloid binding alcohol dehydrogenase, a mitochondrial protein, is a cofactor facilitating amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) induced cell stress. Antagonizing Abeta-ABAD interaction protects against aberrant mitochondrial and neuronal function and improves learning memory in the Alzheimer's disease mouse model. Therefore, it offers a potential target for Alzheimer's drug design, by identifying potential inhibitors of Abeta-ABAD interaction. 2D QSAR methods were applied to novel compounds with known IC(50) values, which formed a training set. A correlation analysis was carried out comparing the statistics of the measured IC(50) with predicted values. These selectivity-determining descriptors were interpreted graphically in terms of principle component analyses, which are highly informative for the lead optimization process with respect to activity enhancement. A 3D pharmacophore model also was created. The 2D QSAR and 3D pharmacophore models will assist in high-throughput screening. In addition, ADME descriptors were also determined to study their pharmacokinetic properties. Finally, amyloid binding alcohol dehydrogenase molecular docking study of these novel molecules was undertaken to determine whether these compounds exhibit significant binding affinity with the binding site. We have synthesized only the compounds that have shown the best drug-like properties as candidates for further studies.
