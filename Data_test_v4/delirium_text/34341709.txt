34341709|t|Self-eating and Heart: The Emerging Roles of Autophagy in Calcific Aortic Valve Disease.
34341709|a|Autophagy is a self-degradative pathway by which subcellular elements are broken down intracellularly to maintain cellular homeostasis. Cardiac autophagy commonly decreases with aging and is accompanied by the accumulation of misfolded proteins and dysfunctional organelles, which are undesirable to the cell. Reduction of autophagy over time leads to aging-related cardiac dysfunction and is inversely related to longevity. However, despite the increasing interest in autophagy in cardiac diseases and aging, the process remains an undervalued and disregarded object in calcific valvular disease. Neither the nature through which autophagy is triggered nor the interplay between autophagic machinery and targeted molecules during aortic valve calcification are fully understood. Recently, the upregulation of autophagy has been shown to result in cardioprotective effects against cell death as well as its origin. Here, we review the evidence that shows how autophagy can be both beneficial and detrimental as it pertains to aortic valve calcification in the heart.
