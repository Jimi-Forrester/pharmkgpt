12207970|a|Mutations in the presenilin 1 and 2 genes cause the majority of early onset familial forms of Alzheimer's disease. Here we describe the biochemical and immunohistochemical characterization of calsenilin, a novel calcium binding protein that we have previously shown to interact with presenilins 1 and 2, in mouse brain. The co-immunoprecipitation of endogenous calsenilin and presenilin 1 demonstrates that these proteins are physiologic binding partners. Although calsenilin has been predicted to be a soluble protein, we have found that the majority of it is tightly associated with the cytoplasmic face of intracellular membranes and that it can only be dissociated using harsh treatments such as urea. In addition, we have demonstrated that calsenilin is a developmentally regulated protein that is mainly present in the brain, where it localizes to both the hippocampus and cerebellum. Calsenilin staining co-localized with the somatodendritic marker microtubule-associated protein-2 primarily in the granular cell layer of the cerebellum, indicating that calsenilin expression is primarily neuronal. In primary cultured neurons, calsenilin immunoreactivity was observed in cell bodies as well as in some neuronal processes. Co-localization experiments using specific axonal and dendritic markers indicate that these processes were mainly axonal in nature, although a smaller subset of dendrites also appears to contain calsenilin. In summary, we have established that calsenilin and presenilin 1 can interact at physiologic levels, and that calsenilin is a developmentally regulated protein that is expressed primarily in the cerebellum and hippocampus. Although calsenilin is a soluble protein, it is tightly associated with the membrane. Finally, the expression pattern of calsenilin, which is similar to that of the presenilin(s), suggests that the common locations of these two proteins provide an opportunity for physical interaction in vivo.
