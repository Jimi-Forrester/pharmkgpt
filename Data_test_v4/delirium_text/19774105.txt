19774105|a|Anomalous choline metabolic patterns have been consistently observed in vivo using Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) analysis of patients with neurodegenerative diseases and tissues from cancer patient. It remains unclear; however, what signaling events may have triggered these choline metabolic aberrancies. This study investigates how changes in choline and phospholipid metabolism are regulated by distinct changes in the mitochondrial electron transport system (ETS). We used specific inhibitors to down regulate the function of individual protein complexes in the ETS of SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. Interestingly, we found that dramatic elevation in the levels of phosphatidylcholine metabolites could be induced by the inhibition of individual ETS complexes, similar to in vivo observations. Such interferences produced divergent metabolic patterns, which were distinguishable via principal component analysis of the cellular metabolomes. Functional impairments in ETS components have been reported in several central nervous system (CNS) diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD); however, it remains largely unknown how the suppression of individual ETS complex function could lead to specific dysfunction in different cell types, resulting in distinct disease phenotypes. Our results suggest that the inhibition of each of the five ETS complexes might differentially regulate phospholipase activities within choline metabolic pathways in neuronal cells, which could contribute to the overall understanding of mitochondrial diseases.
