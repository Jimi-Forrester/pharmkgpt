38606200|t|Assessing resting-state brain functional connectivity in adolescents and young adults with narcolepsy using functional near-infrared spectroscopy.
38606200|a|This study aimed to elucidate the alterations in the prefrontal cortex's functional connectivity and network topology in narcolepsy patients using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Twelve narcolepsy-diagnosed patients from Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region's People's Hospital Sleep Medicine Department and 11 matched healthy controls underwent resting fNIRS scans. Functional connectivity and graph theory analyses were employed to assess the prefrontal cortex network's properties and their correlation with clinical features. Results indicated increased functional connectivity in these adolescent and young adult patients with narcolepsy, with significant variations in metrics like average degree centrality and node efficiency, particularly in the left middle frontal gyrus. These alterations showed correlations with clinical symptoms, including depression and sleep efficiency. However, the significance of these findings was reduced post False Discovery Rate adjustment, suggesting a larger sample size is needed for validation. In conclusion, the study offers initial observations that alterations in the prefrontal cortex's functional connectivity may potentially act as a neurobiological indicator of narcolepsy, warranting further investigation with a larger cohort to substantiate these findings and understand the underlying mechanisms.
