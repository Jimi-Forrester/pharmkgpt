20558849|a|The aim of this 12-week, open-label study was to determine the safety and efficacy of donepezil in participants with Alzheimer's disease (AD) residing in assisted living facilities (ALFs). Participants received 5 mg donepezil daily for 6 weeks followed by 10 mg daily for 6 weeks. Primary and secondary outcomes were change from baseline in Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Neuropsychiatric Inventory 8 (NPI-8) scores, respectively. Safety was assessed by adverse events (AEs) and laboratory tests. Of the 97 participants, 76 completed the study. Mean MMSE score (18.7 at baseline) improved 1.8 points (P < .0001) at study end. Total NPI-8 score improved 1.8 points (P = .043). The most frequent AEs were nausea and diarrhea. Donepezil improved cognition and behavior and was safe and well tolerated. The results suggest a need for proactive screening and diagnosis of AD and support the value of treatment and use of donepezil in participants residing in ALFs.
