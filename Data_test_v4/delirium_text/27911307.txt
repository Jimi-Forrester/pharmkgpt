27911307|a|Hypercholesterolemia has been implicated in numerous health problems from cardiovascular disease to neurodegeneration. High serum cholesterol levels in midlife have been associated with an increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) later in life which suggests that the pathways leading to AD pathology might be activated decades before the symptoms of the disease are detected. Cholesterol-fed animals, particularly cholesterol-fed rabbits, exhibit brain pathology similar to the changes found in brains of AD patients. Dietary cholesterol, which cannot pass the blood-brain barrier, is thought to influence central nervous system homeostasis by increased transport of its circulatory breakdown product, 27-hydroxycholesterol (27-OHC), into the brain. 27-OHC is an endogenous selective estrogen receptor modulator. Estrogen-mediated non-reproductive functions require estrogen receptors (ERs) and include modulation of mitochondrial function and structure, as well as regulation of synaptogenesis in the brain. ERs are located in brain areas affected early in AD pathogenesis, including the hippocampus. Here we report that increase in serum cholesterol, induced by feeding rabbits a high-cholesterol diet, is associated with higher levels of 27-OHC in the brain as well as increased levels of neurodegeneration in the hippocampus. Furthermore, these results are accompanied by changes in expression of ERs in the hippocampus as well as a decrease in hippocampal mitochondria. These findings provide an important insight into one of the possible mechanisms involved in the development of AD, and shed light on the processes that may antedate amyloid-beta and tau phosphorylation changes currently hypothesized to cause AD symptomology and pathology.
