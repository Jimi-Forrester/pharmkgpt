32630165|t|Production and Characterization of Anti-Inflammatory Monascus Pigment Derivatives.
32630165|a|The prevention and treatment of chronic inflammation using food-derived compounds are desirable from the perspectives of marketing and safety. Monascus pigments, widely used as food additives, can be used as a chronic inflammation treatment. Orange Monascus pigments were produced by submerged fermentation in a 5 L bioreactor, and multiple orange Monascus pigment derivatives with anti-inflammatory activities were synthesized using aminophilic reaction. A total of 41 types of pigment derivatives were produced by incorporating amines and amino acids into the orange pigments. One derivative candidate that inhibited nitric oxide (NO) production in Raw 264.7 cells and exhibited low cell cytotoxicity was identified via in vitro assay. The 2-amino-4 picoline derivative inhibited NO production of 48.4%, and exhibited cell viability of 90.6%. Expression of inducible NO synthase, an important enzyme in the NO synthesis pathway, was suppressed by such a derivative in a dose-dependent manner. Therefore, this derivative has potential as a functional food colorant with anti-inflammatory effects.
