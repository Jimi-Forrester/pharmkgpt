34046608|t|Shifting the paradigm in treating multi-factorial diseases: polypharmacological co-inhibitors of HDAC6.
34046608|a|Multi-factorial diseases are illnesses that exploit multiple cellular processes, or stages within one process, and thus highly targeted therapies often succumb to the disease, losing efficacy as resistance sets in. Combination therapies have become a mainstay to battle these diseases, however these regimens are plagued with caveats. An emerging avenue to treat multi-factorial diseases is polypharmacology, wherein a single drug is rationally designed to bind multiple targets, and is widely touted to be superior to combination therapy by inherently addressing the latter's shortcomings, which include poor patient compliance, narrow therapeutic windows and spiraling healthcare costs. Through its roles in intracellular trafficking, cell motility, mitosis, protein folding and as a back-up to the proteasome pathway, HDAC6 has rapidly become an exciting new target for therapeutics, particularly in the discovery of new drugs to treat Alzheimer's disease and cancer. Herein, we describe recent efforts to marry together HDAC pharmacophores, with a particular emphasis on HDAC6 selectivity, with those of other targets towards the discovery of potent therapeutics to treat these evasive diseases. Such polypharmacological agents may supercede combination therapies through inherent synergism, permitting reduced dosing, wider therapeutic windows and improved compliance.
