34174837|t|Association between protoporphyrin IX and sarcopenia: a cross sectional study.
34174837|a|BACKGROUND: According to the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP), the diagnosis of sarcopenia primarily focused on low muscle strength with the detection of low muscle quality and quantity as confirming index. Many studies had identified mitochondrial dysfunction as one of the multifactorial etiologies of sarcopenia. Yet, no study had investigated the role of biosynthetic pathway intermediate, which was found in mitochondria, in the development of sarcopenia. This study aimed to examine the association between protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) and components of sarcopenia. METHOD: The present study enrolled 1172 participants without anemia between 1999 to 2002 from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) database. We employed the multivariable-logistic regression model to examine the relationship between PPIX and sarcopenia. Covariate adjustments were designated to each of the three models for further analysis of the relationship. RESULTS: In the unadjusted model, PPIX was significantly associated with sarcopenia (OR = 3.910, 95% CI = 2.375, 6.439, P value < 0.001). The significance persisted after covariate adjustments as observed in the fully adjusted model (OR = 2.537, 95% CI = 1.419, 4.537, P value = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study suggested statistically significant association between PPIX and sarcopenia. Our study disclosed the potential of PPIX as a valuable indicator of sarcopenia.
