37027832|t|Dietary pattern, food, and nutritional supplement effects on cognitive outcomes in mild cognitive impairment: a systematic review of previous reviews.
37027832|a|CONTEXT: Nutritional interventions may benefit cognition in people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). However, evidence is yet to be synthesized in a way that can inform recommendations for clinical and public health settings. OBJECTIVE: To systematically review evidence on the effect of dietary patterns, foods, and nutritional supplements on cognitive decline in individuals with MCI. DATA SOURCES: Guided by the Preferred Reporting items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols 2015 statement, the Medline, EMBASE, and CINAHL databases, the JBI Database of Systematic Reviews and Implementation Reports, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects were searched (publication years 2005 to 2020). Included studies were English-language systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials and cohort studies reporting on the effectiveness of nutritional interventions on cognition of individuals with MCI. DATA EXTRACTION: Two reviewers independently selected studies and extracted data on cognitive outcomes and adverse events. Review quality was assessed using AMSTAR 2 (A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews-2). Primary study overlap was managed following Cochrane Handbook guidelines. DATA ANALYSIS: Of the 6677 records retrieved, 20 reviews were included, which, in turn, reported on 43 randomized controlled trials and 1 cohort study that, together, addressed 18 nutritional interventions. Most reviews were limited by quality and the small number of primary studies with small sample sizes. Reviews were mostly positive for B vitamins, omega-3 fatty acids, and probiotics (including 12, 11 and 4 primary studies, respectively). Souvenaid and the Mediterranean diet reduced cognitive decline or Alzheimer's disease progression in single trials with <500 participants. Findings from studies with a small number of participants suggest vitamin D, a low-carbohydrate diet, medium-chain triglycerides, blueberries, grape juice, cocoa flavanols, and Brazil nuts may improve individual cognitive subdomains, but more studies are needed. CONCLUSIONS: Few nutritional interventions were found to convincingly improve cognition of individuals with MCI. More high-quality research in MCI populations is required to determine if nutritional treatments improve cognition and/or reduce progression to dementia.
