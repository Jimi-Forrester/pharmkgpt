38214485|t|A Near-infrared Fluorescence and Positron Emission Tomography Bimodal Probe for In Vivo Imaging of Amyloid-beta Species.
38214485|a|Noninvasive imaging of amyloid-beta (Abeta) species in vivo is important for the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this paper, we report a near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence (FL) and positron emission tomography (PET) bimodal probe (NIR-[68Ga]) for in vivo imaging of both soluble and insoluble Abeta species. NIR-[68Ga] holds a high binding affinity, high selectivity and high sensitivity toward Abeta42 monomers, oligomers, and aggregates in vitro. In vivo imaging results show that NIR-[68Ga] can cross the blood-brain-barrier (BBB), and produce significantly higher PET and NIR FL bimodal signals in the brains of APP/PS1 transgenic AD mice relative to that of age-matched wild-type mice, which are also validated by the ex vivo autoradiography and histological staining images. Our results demonstrate that NIR-[68Ga] is an efficient NIR FL and PET bimodal probe for the sensitive imaging of soluble and insoluble Abeta species in AD mice.
