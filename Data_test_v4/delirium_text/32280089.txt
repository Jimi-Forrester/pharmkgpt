32280089|a|BACKGROUND: Hydromethylthionine is a potent inhibitor of pathological aggregation of tau and TDP-43 proteins. OBJECTIVE: To compare hydromethylthionine treatment effects at two doses and to determine how drug exposure is related to treatment response in bvFTD. METHODS: We undertook a 52-week Phase III study in 220 bvFTD patients randomized to compare hydromethylthionine at 200 mg/day and 8 mg/day (intended as a control). The principal outcomes were change on the Addenbrookes Cognitive Examination - Revised (ACE-R), the Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ), and whole brain volume. Secondary outcomes included Modified Clinical Global Impression of Change (Modified-CGIC). A population pharmacokinetic exposure-response analysis was undertaken in 175 of the patients with available blood samples and outcome data using a discriminatory plasma assay for the parent drug. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the two doses as randomized. There were steep concentration-response relationships for plasma levels in the range 0.3-0.6 ng/ml at the 8 mg/day dose on clinical and MRI outcomes. There were significant exposure-dependent differences at 8 mg/day for FAQ, Modified-CGIC, and whole brain atrophy comparing patients with plasma levels greater than 0.346 ng/ml with having minimal drug exposure. The exposure-response is biphasic with worse outcomes at the high concentrations produced by 200 mg/day. CONCLUSIONS: Hydromethylthionine has a similar concentration-response profile for effects on clinical decline and brain atrophy at the 8 mg/day dose in bvFTD as recently reported in AD. Treatment responses in bvFTD are predicted to be maximal at doses in the range 20-60 mg/day. A confirmatory placebo-controlled trial is now planned.
