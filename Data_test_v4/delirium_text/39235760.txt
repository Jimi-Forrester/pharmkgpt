39235760|t|Synthesis and characterization of fullerene-based nanocarrier for targeted delivery of quercetin to the brain.
39235760|a|Aim: Preparation of quercetin fullerene conjugate (QFC) for nose-to-brain delivery and their in vitro and ex vivo characterizations.Methods: Carboxylated fullerene was converted into acetylated fullerene and quercetin was conjugated and physically adsorbed on acetylated fullerene.Results: The particle size and zeta potential of QFC and chitosan-coated QFC (CC-QFC) were found to be 179.2 +- 1.10, 293.4 +- 2.757, -5.28 +- 1.43 and 11.6 +- 0.4 respectively. The entrapment efficiency, loading efficiency of QFC were found to be 85.55% and 42.77%. The MTT assay revealed 80.69% SH-SY5Y cell viability at a concentration of 50 mug/ml. CC-QFC showed remarkable (89.20%) ex vivo mucoadhesive properties compared with QFC (66.67%). Further study showed no significant ciliotoxicity by CC-QFC.Conclusion: The obtained results suggested the potential of CC-QFC for treatment in Alzheimer's disease.
