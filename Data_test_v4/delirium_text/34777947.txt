34777947|a|Purpose of Review: With the projected increase in the geriatric patient population, it is of the utmost importance to understand and optimize conditions in the perioperative period to ensure the best surgical outcome. Age-associated changes in respiratory physiology affect the surgical management of geriatric patients. This review focuses on perioperative pulmonary management of elderly individuals. Recent Findings: The physiological changes associated with aging include both physical and biochemical alterations that are detrimental to pulmonary function. There is an increased prevalence of chronic lung disease such as COPD and interstitial lung disease which can predispose patients to postoperative pulmonary complications. Additionally, elderly patients, especially those with chronic lung disease, are at risk for frailty. Screening tools have been developed to evaluate risk and aid in the judicious selection of patients for surgical procedures. The concept of "prehabilitation" has been developed to best prepare patients for surgery and may be more influential in the reduction of postoperative pulmonary complications than postoperative rehabilitation. Understanding the age-associated changes in metabolism of drugs has led to dose adjustments in the intraoperative and postoperative periods, reducing respiratory depression and lung protective ventilation and minimally invasive procedures have yielded reductions in postoperative pulmonary complications. Summary: The perioperative management of the geriatric population can be divided into three key areas: preoperative risk mitigation, intraoperative considerations, and postoperative management. Preoperative considerations include patient selection and thorough history and physical, along with smoking cessation and prehabilitation in a subset of patients. Operative aspects include careful selection of anesthetic agents, lung protective ventilation, and choice of surgical procedure. Postoperative management should focus on selective use of agents that may contribute to respiratory depression and encouragement of rehabilitation.
