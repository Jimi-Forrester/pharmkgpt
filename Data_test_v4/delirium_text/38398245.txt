38398245|t|Association between Preoperative Glucose Dysregulation and Delirium after Non-Cardiac Surgery.
38398245|a|This study aimed to investigate the association between glucose dysregulation and delirium after non-cardiac surgery. Among a total of 203,787 patients who underwent non-cardiac surgery between January 2011 and June 2019 at our institution, we selected 61,805 with available preoperative blood glucose levels within 24 h before surgery. Patients experiencing glucose dysregulation were divided into three groups: hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, and both. We compared the incidence of postoperative delirium within 30 days after surgery between exposed and unexposed patients according to the type of glucose dysregulation. The overall incidence of hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, and both was 5851 (9.5%), 1452 (2.3%), and 145 (0.2%), respectively. The rate of delirium per 100 person-months of the exposed group was higher than that of the unexposed group in all types of glucose dysregulation. After adjustment, the hazard ratios of glucose dysregulation in the development of delirium were 1.35 (95% CI, 1.18-1.56) in hyperglycemia, 1.36 (95% CI, 1.06-1.75) in hypoglycemia, and 3.14 (95% CI, 1.27-7.77) in both. The subgroup analysis showed that exposure to hypoglycemia or both to hypo- and hyperglycemia was not associated with delirium in diabetic patients, but hyperglycemia was consistently associated with postoperative delirium regardless of the presence of diabetes. Preoperative glucose dysregulation was associated with increased risk of delirium after non-cardiac surgery. Our findings may be helpful for preventing postoperative delirium, and further investigations are required to verify the association and mechanisms for the effect we observed.
