37684631|a|BACKGROUND: Assisted reproductive technologies (ART) have increased the incidence of multiple births, which can have a negative impact on maternal and offspring health. The study aimed to investigate the association between genetically predicted multiple birth and the risk of 42 common diseases of the nervous, psychiatric, cardiovascular, respiratory, digestive, and endocrine systems. METHODS: The study utilized two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to explore the potential causal relationship between genetically predicted multiple birth and the genetically predicted risk of diseases. The study used the FinnGen and UK Biobank datasets for analysis. RESULTS: The study found no significant causal relationship between multiple birth and psychiatric disorders. However, the lower limits of the 95% confidence intervals for bipolar affective disorder and anxiety disorders were not robust, indicating a need for further investigation. The study found that multiple birth may be a strong risk factor for infantile cerebral palsy, and caution is necessary in both natural and ART multiple births. The study revealed a potential causal relationship between multiple birth and coronary heart disease, ischemic heart disease, and deep vein thrombosis, which may be related to abnormal intrauterine environments in multiple pregnancies. Surprisingly, multiple birth appears to have a protective effect against some respiratory diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma. CONCLUSIONS: The study highlights the need for caution regarding the risk of infantile cerebral palsy, cardiovascular diseases, and psychiatric disorders in multiple birth. Our study can lead to the development of preventive strategies and improved clinical management for affected infants.
