24150106|a|Dietary supplementation has been studied as an approach to ameliorating deficits associated with aging and neurodegeneration. We undertook this pilot study to investigate the effects of coconut oil supplementation directly on cortical neurons treated with amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide in vitro. Our results indicate that neuron survival in cultures co-treated with coconut oil and Abeta is rescued compared to cultures exposed only to Abeta. Coconut oil co-treatment also attenuates Abeta-induced mitochondrial alterations. The results of this pilot study provide a basis for further investigation of the effects of coconut oil, or its constituents, on neuronal survival focusing on mechanisms that may be involved.
