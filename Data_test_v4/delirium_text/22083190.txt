22083190|a|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the feasibility of oral fluoropyrimidines after resection and microwave coagulation(MCT), or radiofrequency ablation(RFA)of liver metastases from colorectal cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Background factors, fluoropyrimidine administration(S-1 or UFT/LV), and adverse events were analyzed in 20 patients(17 males, 3 females; an average of 62. 4 years)with colorectal liver metastases after resection and RFA or MCT. RESULTS: The synchronous: metachronous metastases ratio was 13:7. Fifteen patients received the recommended dose and 5 received a reduced dose. S-1 was administered for 4 weeks followed by a 2-week rest for 7 patients, and for 2 weeks followed by a 1-week rest for 9 patients. UFT/LV was administered for 4 weeks followed by a 1-week rest for 4 patients. Fourteen patients(70%)had adverse events. One patient showed grade 3 leukocyte toxicity while other patients showed grade 1 or 2. Two patients discontinued chemotherapy because of grade 2 delirium and grade 2 CPK elevation; another 2 discontinued voluntarily. Eight patients with recurrence changed the rugs, while 8 of 12(67%)continued for 1 year. Median disease-free and med ian overall survival lengths were 16. 1 and 4 7. 6 months, respectively. CONCLUSION: S-1 and UFT /LV were used safely as adjuvant chemotherapies after the resection and local coagulation therapy of liver metastases.
