37483772|a|Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the major and leading cause of mortality and an alarming public health challenge. TBI leads to permanent cognitive, motor, sensory and psychotic disabilities. Patients suffering from the various and long-term repercussions of TBI currently have limited therapy choices. The current research work was designed to evaluate the beneficial and neuroprotective role of Troxerutin (Trox) (a natural flavonoid) in a closed brain injury mouse model. The male BALB/c 8-weeks old mice (n 150) were randomly distributed in three experimental groups. Control group of mice (n 50), TBI group (n 50) and Trox pre-treated mice group (Trox + TBI, n 50). The mice in Trox + TBI were pre-treated with Trox (150 mg/kg, 7 days) before TBI. The weight-drop mechanism was used to induce mild-moderate injury in mice in both the groups. Our results showed that the mice pre-treated with troxerutin significantly improved neurological severity score, blood glucose level, food intake and brain edema as compared to the mice in the TBI group. Furthermore, compared to the TBI group, the mice treated with troxerutin improved cognitive behavior as evaluated by Open field test, Shallow Water Maze and Y-Maze, decreased brain-infarct volume and blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, significantly decreased Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), improved neuronal morphology and survival in the brain regions such as cortex and hippocampus. In summary, our data provided evidence that pre-treatment with troxerutin improved neurological functions, decreased the BBB permeability, improved behavior, reduced ROS and increased neuronal survival in the weight-drop close head traumatic injury mouse model.
