20673934|a|INTRODUCTION: Cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers are a fundamental contribution for the diagnosis of Alzheimer disease, in particular for young people. CASE REPORT: We report a case of Alzheimer disease of a 51-years old man whose clinical presentation corresponded to frontotemporal behavioural criteria. The clinical evaluation noticed some troubles in verbal memory. Only the CSF biomarkers confirmed the diagnosis. CONCLUSION: There are different phenotypes of presenile Alzheimer disease and among them we note frontotemporal dementia. It is very important to identify them to introduce a specific treatment.
