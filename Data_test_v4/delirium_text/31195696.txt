31195696|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the stability over time of the psychiatric diagnoses among candidates to liver transplantation referred to a consultation-liaison psychiatric service. METHOD: Descriptive study, carried out at the Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry Service (CLPS) placed at the Modena (Italy) General University Hospital. All patients waiting for liver transplantation and repeatedly referred to the CLPS were enrolled. The observation period was from 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2013. Pearson's coefficients were calculated to measure diagnostic stability (index referral vs. last referral). RESULTS: One hundred patients were assessed (males 67%; mean age 53 +- 7 years old). The mean number of referrals for patients was 3 +- 2. The stability rate of psychiatric diagnosis was 64%. The following diagnoses or conditions were all significantly stable (i.e., all featured by r > 0.5 and p < 0.05): Adjustment disorder, depressive disorder, comorbid anxiety/depressive disorder, substance use disorder (including alcohol), absence of any disorder, and presence of any disorder. CONCLUSIONS: The good level of diagnostic stability displayed in the sample may be a function of the clinical and organizational "style" of the CLPS, namely the focus on identifying the prevailing personality traits, defensive mechanisms, and relational patterns.
