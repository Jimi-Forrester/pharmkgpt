39051339|t|In Vitro: The Extraordinary Enhancement in Rutin Accumulation and Antioxidant Activity in Philodendron "Imperial Red" Plantlets Using Ti-Mo-Ni-O Nanotubes as a Novel Elicitor.
39051339|a|Rutin, a flavonoid phytochemical compound, plays a vital role in human health. It is used in treating capillary fragility and has anti-Alzheimer, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant effects. In this study, Ti-Mo-Ni-O nanotubes (NTs) were used, for the first time, in an unprecedented plant biotechnology application, wherein in vitro Philodendron shoots (Philodendron erubescens) known as "Imperial Red" were targeted for rutin accumulation. The antioxidant responses and the accumulation of rutin were evaluated in treated Philodendron erubescens (P. erubescens) shoots using 5.0 mg/L of Ti-Mo-Ni-O NTs. The total phenolic content and total flavonoid content were estimated, and an ABTS+ assay, FRAP assay, and iron metal chelation assay were performed. The application of Ti-Mo-Ni-O NTs enhanced the rutin content considerably from 0.02 mg/g to 2.96 mg/g for dry-weight shootlet extracts. Therefore, the use of Ti-Mo-Ni-O NTs is proposed to be a superior alternative to elevate the rutin content. The aim of the current study is to target P. erubescens shoots grown in vitro for the accumulation of rutin compounds using Ti-Mo-Ni-O NT powder, to determine the quantitative and qualitative accumulation of rutin via HPLC-DAD analysis, and to estimate the antioxidant activity of P. erubescens shoot extract. This study presents a novel methodology for utilizing nano-biotechnology in the synthesis of plant secondary metabolites.
