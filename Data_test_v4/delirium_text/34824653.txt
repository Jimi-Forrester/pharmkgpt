34824653|t|Role of computed tomography (CT) in identifying foreign body ingestion in an individual with autism - A case report.
34824653|a|Foreign body ingestions are quite common and most often will uneventfully pass in stool, however, some ingestions, can lead to complications such as obstruction. If left untreated, this can lead to perforation and fistula formation. Hence, threshold for intervention should be low and diagnostic imaging can assist with treatment decisions. We present to you a case of 17-year-old male with non-verbal autism with an unusual hollow foreign body ingestion leading to small bowel obstruction.
