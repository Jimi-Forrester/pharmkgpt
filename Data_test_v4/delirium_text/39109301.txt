39109301|t|An insight into carcinogenic activity and molecular mechanisms of Bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate.
39109301|a|Di(ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) is a ubiquitous environmental contaminant to which humans are exposed via multiple routes. Human health risk assessments for this substance have recently been updated, focusing on reproductive toxicity, including DEHP, in the list of chemicals classified as carcinogenic, mutagenic, or toxic to reproduction (CMR). Moreover, DEHP has also been defined as probably and possibly carcinogenic to humans based on its carcinogenicity in rodents. However, the mechanism of action of DEHP and its relevance in humans remain unclear. Rodent data suggests that DEHP induces cancer through non-genotoxic mechanisms related to multiple molecular signals, including PPARalpha activation, perturbation of fatty acid metabolism, induction of cell proliferation, decreased apoptosis, production of reactive oxygen species, and oxidative stress. According to the DEHP toxicological dataset, several in vitro cell transformation assays have been performed using different protocols and cellular models to produce different results. This study aimed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of DEHP by using the A31-1-1 BALB/c-3T3 cell line in a standard cell transformation assay. Additionally, transcriptomic analysis was performed to explore the molecular responses and identify the affected toxicological pathways. Although DEHP treatment did not induce transformation in BALB/c-3T3 cells, the transcriptomic results revealed significant modulation of several pathways associated with DEHP metabolism, tissue-specific functions related to systemic metabolism, and basal cellular signaling with pleiotropic outcomes. Among these signaling pathways, modulation of cell-regulating signaling pathways, such as Notch, Wnt, and TGF-beta, can be highlighted. More specific modulation of such genes and pathways with double functions in metabolism and neurophysiology underlies the well-known crosstalk that may be crucial for the mechanism of action of DEHP. Our findings offer evidence to support the notion that these models are effective in minimizing the use of animal testing for toxicity assessment.
