37980664|a|BACKGROUND: Emerging evidence suggests a potential causal role of neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Using positron emission tomography (PET) to image overexpressed 18 kDA translocator protein (TSPO) by activated microglia has gained increasing interest. The uptake of 18F-GE180 TSPO PET was observed to co-localize with inflammatory markers and have a two-stage association with amyloid PET in mice. Very few studies evaluated the diagnostic power of 18F-GE180 PET in AD population and its interpretation in human remains controversial about whether it is a marker of microglial activation or merely reflects disrupted blood-brain barrier integrity in humans. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to study human GE180 from the perspective of the previous animal observations. METHODS: With data from twenty-four participants having 18F-GE180 and 18F-AV45 PET scans, we evaluated the group differences of 18F-GE180 uptake between participants with and without cognitive impairment. An association analysis of 18F-GE180 and 18F-AV45 was then conducted to test if the relationship in humans is consistent with the two-stage association in AD mouse model. RESULTS: Elevated 18F-GE180 was observed in participants with cognitive impairment compared to those with normal cognition. No regions showed reduced 18F-GE180 uptake. Consistent with mouse model, a two-stage association between 18F-GE180 and 18F-AV45 was observed. CONCLUSIONS: 18F-GE180 PET imaging showed promising utility in detecting pathological alterations in a symptomatic AD population. Consistent two-stage association between 18F-GE180 and amyloid PET in human and mouse suggested that 18F-GE180 uptake in human might be considerably influenced by microglial activation.
