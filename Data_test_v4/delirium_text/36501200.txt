36501200|t|Targeting mTOR Signaling by Dietary Polyphenols in Obesity Prevention.
36501200|a|Dietary polyphenols can be utilized to treat obesity and chronic disorders linked to it. Dietary polyphenols can inhibit pre-adipocyte proliferation, adipocyte differentiation, and triglyceride accumulation; meanwhile, polyphenols can also stimulate lipolysis and fatty acid beta-oxidation, but the molecular mechanisms of anti-obesity are still unclear. The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a protein kinase that regulates cell growth, survival, metabolism, and immunity. mTOR signaling is also thought to play a key role in the development of metabolic diseases such as obesity. Recent studies showed that dietary polyphenols could target mTOR to reduce obesity. In this review, we systematically summarized the research progress of polyphenols in preventing obesity through the mTOR signaling pathway. Mechanistically, polyphenols can target multiple signaling pathways and gut microbiota to regulate the mTOR signaling pathway to exert anti-obesity effects. The main mechanisms include: modulating lipid metabolism, adipogenesis, inflammation, etc. Dietary polyphenols exerting an anti-obesity effect by targeting mTOR signaling will broaden our understanding of the anti-obesity mechanisms of polyphenols and provide valuable insights for researchers in this novel field.
