34440599|t|The Role of Gut Microbiota in Aging and Aging Related Neurodegenerative Disorders: Insights from Drosophila Model.
34440599|a|Aging is characterized by a time dependent impairment of physiological function and increased susceptibility to death. It is the major risk factor for neurodegeneration. Neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are the main causes of dementia in the old population. Gut microbiota is a community of microorganisms colonized in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The alteration of gut microbiota has been proved to be associated with aging and aging related neurodegeneration. Drosophila is a powerful tool to study microbiota-mediated physiological and pathological functions. Here, we summarize the recent advances using Drosophila as model organisms to clarify the molecular mechanisms and develop a therapeutic method targeting microbiota in aging and aging-related neurodegenerative disorders.
