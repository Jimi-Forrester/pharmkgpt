However, few studies have examined biomarkers of AD among Mexican Americans, the largest segment of the U.S. Hispanic population. OBJECTIVE: We sought to examine proteomic profiles of an MRI-based marker of neurodegeneration from the AT(N) framework among a multi-ethnic, community-dwelling cohort. METHODS: Community-dwelling Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic white adults and elders were recruited. All participants underwent comprehensive assessments including an interview, functional exam, clinical labs, informant interview, neuropsychological testing, and 3T MRI of the brain. A neurodegeneration MRI meta-ROI biomarker for the AT(N) framework was calculated. RESULTS: Data was examined from n = 1,291 participants. Proteomic profiles were highly accurate for detecting neurodegeneration (i.e., N+) among both Mexican Americans (AUC = 1.0) and non-Hispanic whites (AUC = 0.98). The proteomic profile of N + was different between ethnic groups. Further analyses revealed that the proteomic profiles of N + varied by diagnostic status (control, MCI, dementia) and ethnicity (Mexican American versus non-Hispanic whites) though diagnostic accuracy was high for all classifications. CONCLUSION: A proteomic profile of neurodegeneration has tremendous value and point towards novel diagnostic and intervention opportunities. The current findings demonstrate that the underlying biological factors associated with neurodegeneration are different between Mexican Americans versus non-Hispanic whites as well as at different levels of disease progression.
