38541060|t|Opioids in Treatment of Refractory Dyspnea in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease: Yes, No or Maybe.
38541060|a|Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a complex condition with significant impact on prognosis, especially in advanced stages where symptom burden becomes critical. Breathlessness affects patients' quality of life, and despite various therapeutic strategies, the role of opioids in palliative care for COPD remains under investigation. The acceptance of a therapeutic trial of different types of opioids is increasing not only in end-of-life situations but also for stable COPD patients experiencing intolerable refractory breathlessness despite optimal conventional therapy. Recent clinical trials have raised questions about the overall clinical benefit of opioids in addressing breathlessness in COPD, prompting the need to clarify inconsistencies and identify specific subgroups that may benefit from opioid therapy. In the clinical setting, it is crucial to understand the attributes of patients who exhibit positive responses to opioids and what type of opioids could have a positive impact. This research paper aims to offer an update of the most recent evidence of opioid treatment in managing breathlessness among individuals with COPD with a head-to-head evaluation of the supporting and opposing proof in the medical literature.
