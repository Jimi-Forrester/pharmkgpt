31128832|a|INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease is a degenerative brain disease and the most common cause of dementia. Today, 47 million people live with dementia worldwide. This number is projected to increase to more than 131 million by 2050, as populations age. Therefore, the World Health Organization considers serious cognitive deterioration a public health priority. OBJECTIVES: Advanced cognitive evaluation mechanisms are needed to help make an early diagnosis. These new mechanisms should overcome the limitations of current neuropsychological tests, including delayed detection; being perceived as intrusive; being non-ecological; being dependent on confounding factors; or their administration being expensive, among others. A promising novel approach consists of the introduction of serious games based on virtual reality and machine learning able to assess cognitive traits relevant to the diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: As a result of a preliminary pilot experiment, promising evidence was obtained about the predictive power of this solution. However, for these new serious games to be effective, evidence has to be gathered on the player experience by senior adults, avoiding the limitations of traditional tests at the same time. This study addresses these aspects with the participation of 74 senior users and 15 test administrators. RESULTS: Main findings confirm the usability and playability of Panoramix, a game battery designed according to the principles discussed above, its technological acceptability and its accessibility. For example, in relation to acceptability, the game battery was scored 4.39 in a 5-point scale, while its average usability score was 4.45 regardless of socio-cultural level or previous experience with digital technologies. In addition, health professionals confirm both, usability and playability, levels with an average score of 6.5 in a 7-point scale. Participants' willingness of using this kind of systems for cognitive evaluation was also confirmed. CONCLUSION: Promising results obtained pave the way for additional work to confirm the diagnostic validity according to clinical standards of these new cognitive assessment tools.
