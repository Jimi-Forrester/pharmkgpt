29955457|t|Evaluating nursing satisfaction and utilization of the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol, revised version (CIWA-Ar).
29955457|a|INTRODUCTION: The Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol, revised version (CIWA-Ar), developed and validated for research, is used in our inpatient academic medical center. We sought to assess nursing satisfaction with the scale itself, training for using the scale, and nursing staff use of the CIWA-Ar. METHODS: A retrospective chart review included all patients with an order for CIWA-Ar between August 1, 2014, and September 30, 2014. Data collected included demographics, admitting diagnosis, vital signs, admission blood alcohol level, lorazepam total daily dose, and CIWA-Ar scores. Nursing staff was sent an anonymous, 26-question survey in January 2015. The survey collected demographics, training history, and recommendations for modifications to the CIWA-Ar. RESULTS: During the 2-month period, 274 patients had orders for CIWA-Ar, with 113 receiving at least one dose of lorazepam. Lorazepam was not given to 21% of patients when they scored >8 on the CIWA-Ar, whereas 71% of patients received a dose of lorazepam when they had a CIWA score <8. The survey was sent to 2011 clinical nurses, with 284 responses received (14% response rate). Only 36% of responding nurses felt adequately trained to administer the CIWA-Ar. Most nurses preferred on-the-job and online training methods. DISCUSSION: Nursing use of the CIWA-Ar could be optimized at this institution. Fewer than half of respondents reported feeling adequately training to administer the CIWA-Ar. Results will be used to improve training for nursing staff regarding scoring of the CIWA-Ar and administering lorazepam to treat alcohol withdrawal syndrome.
