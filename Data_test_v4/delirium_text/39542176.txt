39542176|a|Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) represent a class of neurological disorders characterized by the progressive degeneration or loss of neurons, impacting millions of individuals globally. In addition to the typical manifestations, pain is a prevalent symptom associated with NDDs, seriously impacting the quality of life for patients. The pathogenesis of pain associated with NDDs is intricate and multifaceted. Currently, the clinical management of NDDs-related pain symptoms predominantly relies on conventional pharmacological agents or physical therapy. However, these approaches often fail to produce satisfactory outcomes. This article summarizes the underlying mechanisms of major NDDs-associated pain: Neuroinflammation, Brain and spinal cord dysfunctions, Mitochondrial dysfunction, Risk gene and pathological protein, as well as Receptor, channel, and neurotransmitter. While numerous studies have investigated the downstream pathological processes associated with these mechanisms, there remains a significant gap in identifying the key initiating factors. Specifically, there is insufficient evidence for the upstream elements that activate microglia and astrocytes in neuroinflammation leading to pain in NDDs. Likewise, there is an absence of upstream factors elucidating how dysfunctions in the brain and spinal cord, as well as mitochondrial impairments, contribute to the development of pain. Furthermore, the specific mechanisms through which hallmark pathological proteins related to NDD contribute to these pathological processes remain inadequately understood. The objective of this article is to synthesize the existing mechanisms underlying pain associated with NDDs, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, schizophrenia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and multiple sclerosis, while also identifying gaps and deficiencies in these mechanisms. This paper offers insights for future research trajectories. Given the intricate pathogenesis of NDD-related pain, it emphasizes that a promising short-term strategy is combination therapy-intervening concurrently in multiple pathological processes-akin to the cocktail approach utilized in treating acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). For long-term advancements, achieving breakthroughs in the treatment of the NDDs themselves will remain essential for alleviating accompanying pain symptoms.
