39228825|t|SIADH and mixed delirium following the abrupt cessation of long-acting benzodiazepines: a case report.
39228825|a|Benzodiazepines (BZDs) are among the most commonly used medications due to their efficacy and rapid onset of action. Although they offer significant therapeutic benefits in treating various psychiatric and neurological conditions, their clinical utility is limited by substantial risks, including dependency and withdrawal symptoms. The syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) has been linked to BZD withdrawal. In this case report, we examine the case of an elderly female presented with a mixed delirium and SIADH following the abrupt cessation of long-term clonazepam therapy. To our knowledge, this is the second case that documents a link between SIADH and BZD withdrawal.
