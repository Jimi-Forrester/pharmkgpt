30279460|a|Among the different initiating events in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis, oxidative stress and neuroinflammation are some of the most iimportant. In the central nervous system, the 12/15Lipoxygenase (12/15LO) enzyme is the source of potent pro-oxidants and inflammatory lipid mediators. Previous works showed that this pathway is up-regulated in AD brains and that its pharmacological targeting modulates the phenotype of transgenic mouse models of the disease. Here we investigate the effect of brain 12/15LO gene delivery on the AD-like phenotype of a mouse model with plaques, tangles and behavioral deficits, the 3xTg mice. Compared with controls, mice over-expressing 12/15LO manifested an exacerbation of spatial learning and memory impairments, which was associated with significant increase in Abeta formation and deposition, and accumulation of hyper-phosphorylated insoluble tau secondary to a down-regulation of autophagy. In addition, the same mice manifested a worsening of neuroinflammation and synaptic pathology. Taken together our study supports the hypothesis that the 12/15LO enzymatic pathway by impairing neuronal autophagy plays a functional role in exacerbating AD-related neuropathologies and cognitive impairments. It provides further critical preclinical evidence to justify developing and testing new and selective 12/15LO inhibitors for AD treatment.
