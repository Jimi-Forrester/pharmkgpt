38338981|t|Kynurenines, Neuronal Excitotoxicity, and Mitochondrial Oxidative Stress: Role of the Intestinal Flora.
38338981|a|The intestinal flora has been the focus of numerous investigations recently, with inquiries not just into the gastrointestinal aspects but also the pathomechanism of other diseases such as nervous system disorders and mitochondrial diseases. Mitochondrial disorders are the most common type of inheritable metabolic illness caused by mutations of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA. Despite the intensive research, its diagnosis is usually difficult, and unfortunately, treating it challenges physicians. Metabolites of the kynurenine pathway are linked to many disorders, such as depression, schizophrenia, migraine, and also diseases associated with impaired mitochondrial function. The kynurenine pathway includes many substances, for instance kynurenic acid and quinolinic acid. In this review, we would like to show a possible link between the metabolites of the kynurenine pathway and mitochondrial stress in the context of intestinal flora. Furthermore, we summarize the possible markers of and future therapeutic options for the kynurenine pathway in excitotoxicity and mitochondrial oxidative stress.
