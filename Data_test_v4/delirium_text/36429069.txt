36429069|t|Role of Long Noncoding RNAs in the Regulation of Cellular Immune Response and Inflammatory Diseases.
36429069|a|Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are recently discovered genetic regulatory molecules that regulate immune responses and are closely associated with the occurrence and development of various diseases, including inflammation, in humans and animals. Under specific physiological conditions, lncRNA expression varies at the cell or tissue level, and lncRNAs can bind to specific miRNAs, target mRNAs, and target proteins to participate in certain processes, such as cell differentiation and inflammatory responses, via the corresponding signaling pathways. This review article summarizes the regulatory role of lncRNAs in macrophage polarization, dendritic cell differentiation, T cell differentiation, and endothelial and epithelial inflammation. In addition, it describes the molecular mechanism of lncRNAs in acute kidney injury, hepatitis, inflammatory injury of the lung, osteoarthritis, mastitis, and neuroinflammation to provide a reference for the molecular regulatory network as well as the genetic diagnosis and treatment of inflammatory diseases in humans and animals.
