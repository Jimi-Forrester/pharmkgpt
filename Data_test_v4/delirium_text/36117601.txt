36117601|t|An Assessment of Quality of Life in Patients With Asthma Through Physical, Emotional, Social, and Occupational Aspects. A Cross-Sectional Study.
36117601|a|Background: Asthma is a prevalent hyperactive airway disease with physical and emotional impact. Severe asthma is associated with considerable health-related quality of life (HRQoL). The aim of this study is to assess the quality of life through physical, emotional, social and occupational aspects and evaluate the factors affecting HRQoL in patients with asthma. Methods: This is a cross-sectional multicenter study conducted on adult asthmatic patients enrolled from community pharmacies across different Lebanese geographic areas. Results: Having wheezing sometimes and most of the time (Beta = -0.144 and -0.552), experiencing anxiety sometimes and most of the time (Beta = -0.205 and -0.573), encountering sleep problems sometimes and most of the time (Beta = -0.270 and -0.553), having previous chest discomfort sometimes and most of the time (Beta = -0.421 and -0.713), and having depression most of the times (Beta = -0.415) were associated with higher lower quality of life scores. On the other side, holding a secondary level of education was associated with a higher quality of life score (Beta = 0.192). Conclusion: This study highlights that asthma affects adults' quality of life through social, emotional, physical, and occupational impacts. Improved follow-up and patient education may be essential in the future to stop disease progression and achieve ideal therapeutic outcomes.
