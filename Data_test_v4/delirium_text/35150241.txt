35150241|t|Proteasome activity modulates amyloid toxicity.
35150241|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is responsible for 60%-80% of identified cases of dementia. While the generation and accumulation of amyloid precursor protein (APP) fragments is accepted as a key step in AD pathogenesis, the precise role of these fragments remains poorly understood. To overcome this deficit, we induced the expression of the soluble C-terminal fragment of APP (C99), the rate-limiting peptide for the generation of amyloid fragments, in yeast that contain thermosensitive mutations in genes encoding proteasome subunits. Our previous work with this system demonstrated that these proteasome-deficient yeast cells, expressing C99 when proteasome activity was blunted, generated amyloid fragments similar to those observed in AD patients. We now report the phenotypic repercussions of inducing C99 expression in proteasome-deficient cells. We show increased levels of protein aggregates, cellular stress and chaperone expression, electron-dense accumulations in the nuclear envelope/ER, abnormal DNA condensation, and an induction of apoptosis. Taken together, these findings suggest that the generation of C99 and its associated fragments in yeast cells with compromised proteasomal activity results in phenotypes that may be relevant to the neuropathological processes observed in AD patients. These data also suggest that this yeast model should be useful for testing therapeutics that target AD-associated amyloid, since it allows for the assessment of the reversal of the perturbed cellular physiology observed when degradation pathways are dysfunctional.
