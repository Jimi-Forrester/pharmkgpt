36415867|t|Barriers and Enablers to the Use of Web-Based Applications for Older Adults and Their Caregivers Post-Hip Fracture Surgery: A Descriptive Qualitative Study.
36415867|a|Purpose: The purpose of this study was to describe the barriers and enablers to the use of web-based applications designed to help manage the personalized needs of older adults and their caregivers post-hip fracture surgery while transitioning from hospital to geriatric rehabilitation to home. Methods: This was a descriptive qualitative study consisting of semi-structured interviews informed by the Theoretical Domains Framework. The study took place between March 2021 and April 2022 on an orthopaedic unit in a large academic health sciences centre and in a geriatric rehabilitation service in Ontario, Canada. The transcripts were analyzed using a systematic 6-step approach. Results: Interviews were conducted with older adults (n = 10) and with caregivers (n = 8) post-hip fracture surgery. A total of 21 barriers and 24 enablers were identified. The top two barriers were a need for basic computer skills (n = 11, 61.1%) and a preference for direct verbal communication (n = 10, 55.6%). The top two enablers were having no concerns with using web-based applications (n = 12, 66.7%) and having ease of access to information (n = 10, 55.6%). Conclusion: We described the key barriers and enablers to the use of web-based applications from the perspectives of older adults and their caregivers. These factors will inform further developments of web-based applications aimed at improving the care transition from hospital to geriatric rehabilitation to home post-hip fracture surgery.
