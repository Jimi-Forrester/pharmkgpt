31397082|a|OBJECTIVES: Interleukin-33, a newly identified member of interleukin-1 family, had been confirmed to play a crucial role in regulating inflammatory responses in various disease. However, the exact role of interleukin-33 in the disease process of acute ischemic stroke still remains unclear. This study aims to demonstrate the relationship between interleukin-33 levels and long-term functional outcome as well as ischemic stroke recurrence. METHODS: Three hundred and four first-ever acute ischemic stroke patients were recruited and basic information and history of all subjects taken within 72 hr on admission. The functional outcome was estimated by Barthel index. The multivariate logistic regression was used to analyze the prognosis, while the Cox proportional hazard model was applied to assess the recurrence risk. RESULTS: Out of 304 subjects, 259 patients successfully completed scheduled two-year follow-up. We found that higher interleukin-33 levels correlated positively with better prognosis as compared with those with lower interleukin-33 levels who presented with poorer outcome (62.45 +- 20.50 ng/ml vs. 51.58 +- 19.16 ng/ml, p < .001). After adjustment of all confounders, interleukin-33 was associated with the one-year prognosis with an adjusted odds ratio of 0.956 (95% confidence interval, 0.937-0.976, p < .001). Furthermore, interleukin-33 levels were also closely related to recurrent ischemic stroke with an adjusted hazard ratio of 0.979 (95% confidence interval, 0.961-0.997, p = .025). CONCLUSIONS: IL-33 can be used to predict the long-term outcomes and ischemic stroke recurrence in first-ever acute ischemic stroke patients.
