37686071|a|This study was conducted to confirm the effects of Korean red ginseng on lung and brain dysfunction in a BALB/c mice model exposed to particulate matter (PM)2.5 for 12 weeks. Learning and cognitive abilities were assessed with Y-maze, passive avoidance, and Morris water maze tests. To evaluate the ameliorating effect of red ginseng extract (RGE), the antioxidant system and mitochondrial function were investigated. The administration of RGE protected lung and brain impairment by regulating the antioxidant system and mitochondrial functions damaged by PM2.5-induced toxicity. Moreover, RGE prevented pulmonary fibrosis by regulating the transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta1) pathway. RGE attenuated PM2.5-induced pulmonary and cognitive dysfunction by regulating systemic inflammation and apoptosis via the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kappaB)/c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) pathway. In conclusion, RGE might be a potential material that can regulate chronic PM2.5-induced lung and brain cognitive dysfunction.
