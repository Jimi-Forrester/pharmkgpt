34956428|t|Integrative genomic analysis of PPP3R1 in Alzheimer's disease: a potential biomarker for predictive, preventive, and personalized medical approach.
34956428|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with abnormal calcium signaling, a pathway regulated by the calcium-dependent protein phosphatase. This study aimed to investigate the molecular function of protein phosphatase 3 regulatory subunit B (PPP3R1) underlying AD, which may provide novel insights for the predictive diagnostics, targeted prevention, and personalization of medical services in AD by targeting PPP3R1. A total of 1860 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from 13,049 background genes were overlapped in AD/control and PPP3R1-low/high cohorts. Based on these DEGs, six co-expression modules were constructed by weight gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA). The turquoise module had the strongest correlation with AD and low PPP3R1, in which DEGs participated in axon guidance, glutamatergic synapse, long-term potentiation (LTP), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), Ras, and hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) signaling pathways. Furthermore, the cross-talking pathways of PPP3R1, such as axon guidance, glutamatergic synapse, LTP, and MAPK signaling pathways, were identified in the global regulatory network. The area under the curve (AUC) analysis showed that low PPP3R1 could accurately predict the onset of AD. Therefore, our findings highlight the involvement of PPP3R1 in the pathogenesis of AD via axon guidance, glutamatergic synapse, LTP, and MAPK signaling pathways, and identify downregulation of PPP3R1 as a potential biomarker for AD treatment in the context of 3P medicine-predictive diagnostics, targeted prevention, and personalization of medical services.
