27025076|t|[Amyloid imaging].
27025076|a|Amyloid imaging is a non-invasive technique that enable us to visualize the distribution of fibrillar amyloid beta deposition in the living human brain. This new imaging technique dramatically accelerated the clinical investigation of early phase of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in the last decade, and now it becomes an essential tool for the observational and interventional prospective studies focusing on prodromal and preclinical AD. In current situations in the advent of effective disease modifying drugs, application of amyloid imaging in clinical practice will be limited to the differential diagnosis of dementia of young onset or atypical clinical presentations. Perspectives on future pathological and therapeutic research will be mentioned.
