36768443|t|The Role of Arginine-Vasopressin in Stroke and the Potential Use of Arginine-Vasopressin Type 1 Receptor Antagonists in Stroke Therapy: A Narrative Review.
36768443|a|Stroke is a life-threatening condition in which accurate diagnoses and timely treatment are critical for successful neurological recovery. The current acute treatment strategies, particularly non-invasive interventions, are limited, thus urging the need for novel therapeutical targets. Arginine vasopressin (AVP) receptor antagonists are emerging as potential targets to treat edema formation and subsequent elevation in intracranial pressure, both significant causes of mortality in acute stroke. Here, we summarize the current knowledge on the mechanisms leading to AVP hyperexcretion in acute stroke and the subsequent secondary neuropathological responses. Furthermore, we discuss the work supporting the predictive value of measuring copeptin, a surrogate marker of AVP in stroke patients, followed by a review of the experimental evidence suggesting AVP receptor antagonists in stroke therapy. As we highlight throughout the narrative, critical gaps in the literature exist and indicate the need for further research to understand better AVP mechanisms in stroke. Likewise, there are advantages and limitations in using copeptin as a prognostic tool, and the translation of findings from experimental animal models to clinical settings has its challenges. Still, monitoring AVP levels and using AVP receptor antagonists as an add-on therapeutic intervention are potential promises in clinical applications to alleviate stroke neurological consequences.
