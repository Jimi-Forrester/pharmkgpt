37628821|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) and epilepsy are common neurological disorders in the elderly. A bi-directional link between these neurological diseases has been reported, with patients with either condition carrying almost a two-fold risk of contracting the other compared to healthy subjects. AD/epilepsy adversely affects patients' quality of life and represents a severe public health problem. Thus, identifying the relationship between epilepsy and AD represents an ongoing challenge and continuing need. Seizures in AD patients are often unrecognized because they are often nonconvulsive and sometimes mimic some behavioral symptoms of AD. Regarding this, it has been hypothesized that epileptogenesis and neurodegeneration share common underlying mechanisms. Targeted treatment to decrease epileptiform activity could represent a valuable strategy for delaying the neurodegenerative process and related cognitive impairment. Several preclinical studies have shown that some antiseizure medications (ASMs) targeting abnormal network hyperexcitability may change the natural progression of AD. However, to date, no guidelines are available for managing seizures in AD patients because of the paucity of randomized clinical trials sufficient for answering the correlated questions. Future AD clinical studies are mandatory to update clinicians about the symptomatic treatment of seizures in AD patients and recognize whether ASM therapy could change the natural progression of the disease, thereby rescuing cognitive performance.
