36589191|t|Morbimortality and Six-Month Survival Among Elderly Patients Treated With Noninvasive Mechanical Ventilation in an Intermediate Care Unit: A Retrospective Evaluation.
36589191|a|BACKGROUND: Noninvasive mechanical ventilation (NIMV) has been established as a successful therapeutic option for patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF) with a specific etiology. OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated the morbimortality of patients with ARF treated with NIMV in a medical intermediate care unit (UCINT) to identify factors associated with higher in-hospital mortality, six-month mortality, and three- and six-month hospital readmission rates. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included elderly patients admitted for ARF and treated with NIMV in the UCINT between 2015 and 2019. RESULTS: In the sample of 102 patients, the median age was 84.2 (+-5.5) years, and 57% were women. In total, 28% were on long-term oxygen therapy, and 68% had a do-not-resuscitate order. At admission, the median Charlson comorbidity index and Barthel index of activities of daily living were 7 [6; 8] and 30 [20; 57,5], respectively. The simplified acute physiology score II was 39.1+-10.7, and 92% of patients had type 2 ARF. Median days on NIMV and days in UCINT were 10 [6; 16] and 6 [3; 10], respectively. The main conditions requiring UCINT admission for NIMV were heart failure, pneumonia, and exacerbation of the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The NIMV failure rate was 7%. At discharge, the average Barthel index was 35 [10; 55]. The in-hospital mortality rate was 23%. DISCUSSION:  Older age, higher simplified acute physiology score II, higher Charlson comorbidity index, and higher number of days on NIMV were associated with higher in-hospital mortality. Long-term oxygen therapy was associated with higher three-month mortality. A higher Barthel index at the time of hospital discharge was associated with a higher six-month readmission rate. CONCLUSION: NIMV can be used successfully in elderly patients and less studied ARF etiologies, such as pneumonia.
