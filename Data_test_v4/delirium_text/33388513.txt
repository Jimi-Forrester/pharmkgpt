33388513|a|INTRODUCTION: Bilateral adrenal hemorrhage can lead to acute adrenal insufficiency. This is a rare complication in the post-operative setting, and we present a case in which it developed after a colectomy for perforated diverticulitis. PRESENTATION OF CASE: The patient is a 65-year-old female who presented with abdominal pain, nausea, emesis, and hematochezia, and CT scan showing sigmoid diverticulitis with peri-sigmoid abscess. After a failure of non-operative treatment, she underwent Hartmann's resection, and her post-operative course was complicated by refractory tachycardia, hypotension, hyponatremia, and nausea/vomiting. Bleeding, hypovolemia, and sepsis were ruled out. A CT scan showed enlarged poorly defined adrenals bilaterally, suggestive of bilateral adrenal hemorrhage. Serum cortisol level was low and diagnostic of acute adrenal insufficiency. With intravenous steroid therapy (hydrocortisone), her vital signs, laboratory abnormalities, and diet intolerance all resolved. She was discharged on oral prednisone and continued long term. DISCUSSION: Bilateral adrenal hemorrhage is rare post-operatively and can lead to adrenal insufficiency. 15% of patients who die in shock have bilateral adrenal hemorrhage on autopsy, indicating the necessity of timely diagnosis and treatment of this condition. Corticosteroid therapy is the mainstay of treatment. CONCLUSION: This case study illustrates that post-operative delay of progression or worsening of condition, with no alternative explanation, can be due to acute adrenal insufficiency resulting from bilateral adrenal hemorrhage, and timely diagnosis and treatment of this condition is paramount for a favorable outcome.
