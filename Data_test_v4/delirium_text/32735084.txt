32735084|t|Hippocampal sclerosis, TDP-43, and the duration of the symptoms of dementia of AD patients.
32735084|a|OBJECTIVES: To examine the relationship between duration of the cognitive symptoms, from the earliest reported symptom to death, and hippocampal sclerosis (HS) and TAR-DNA binding protein of 43kDA (TDP-43) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. METHODS: The study was conducted in 359 cognitively impaired patients who met the pathological criteria for AD (NIA-Reagan intermediate or high). The mean age at onset was 69.5 +- 8.8 years (range 37-95) and the mean duration of the symptoms was 10.5 +- 4.2 years. The association between symptoms duration and HS and TDP-43 was examined with logistic regression analyses controlling for age at death, atherosclerosis in the Circle of Willis (CW), cerebral infarcts, gender, baseline Mini Mental State Examination scores, APOE-4 allele, and presence of Lewy bodies (LB). RESULTS: HS was present in 18% (n = 64) and TDP-43 in 51.5% (n = 185) of the patients. HS and TDP-43 were more frequent in patients whose symptoms lasted more than 10 years. LBs were present in 72% of the patients with HS and in 64% of the patients with TDP-43. Age at onset was not associated with TDP-43 or HS. HS was associated with duration of symptoms and LB, TDP-43, and atherosclerosis in the CW. TDP-43 was associated with duration of symptoms, LB, and HS. INTERPRETATION: HS and TDP-43 are present in early and late onset AD. However, their presence is mainly driven by the duration of symptoms and the presence of LB. This suggests that HS and TDP-43 are part of the later neuropathological changes in AD.
