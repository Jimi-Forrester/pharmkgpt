37342000|a|INTRODUCTION: To investigate the neuroprotective effect and mechanism of Dendrobium nobile polysaccharide (DNP) on vascular dementia (VD) rats. METHODS: VD model rats were prepared by permanent ligation of bilateral common carotid arteries. Cognitive function was tested by morris water maze test, mitochondrial morphology and ultrastructure of hippocampal synapses were tested by transmission electron microscopy, GSH, xCT, GPx4, and PSD-95 expressions were tested by western blot and PCR. RESULTS: The number of platform crossing was significantly increased, and the escape latency was significantly shorter in DNP group. The expressions of GSH, xCT and GPx4 in the hippocampus were up-regulated in DNP group. Moreover, the synapses of DNP group were relatively intact and synaptic vesicles increased, the length of synaptic active zone and PSD thickness were significantly increased, and PSD-95 protein expression was significantly up-regulated compared VD group. CONCLUSION: DNP may take a neuroprotective effect by inhibiting ferroptosis in VD.
