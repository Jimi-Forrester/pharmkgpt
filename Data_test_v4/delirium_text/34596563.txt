34596563|t|Machine Learning to Identify Psychomotor Behaviors of Delirium for Patients in Long-Term Care Facility.
34596563|a|This study aimed to develop accurate and explainable machine learning models for three psychomotor behaviors of delirium for hospitalized adult patients. A prospective pilot study was conducted with 33 participants admitted to a long-term care facility between August 10 and 25, 2020. During the pilot study, we collected 560 cases that included 33 clinical variables and the survey items from the short confusion assessment method (S-CAM), and developed a mobile-based application. Multiple machine learning algorithms, including four rule-mining algorithms (C4.5, CBA, MCAR, and LEM2) and four other statistical learning algorithms (LR, ANNs, SVMs with three kernel functions, and random forest), were validated by paired Wilcoxon signed-rank tests on both macro-averaged F1 and weighted average F1-measures during the 10-times stratified 2-fold cross-validation. The LEM2 algorithm achieved the best prediction performance (macro-averaged F1-measure of 49.35%; weighted average F1-measure of 96.55%), correctly identifying adult patients at delirium risk. In the pairwise comparison between predictive powers observed from independent models, the LEM2 model showed a medium or large effect size between 0.4925 and 0.8766 when compared with LR, ANN, SVM with RBF, and MCAR models. We have confirmed that acute consciousness in S-CAM assessment is closely associated with different predictors for screening three psychomotor behaviors of delirium: 1) education level, dementia type or its level, sleep disorder, dehydration, and infection in mixed-type delirium; 2) gender, education level, dementia type, dehydration, bedsores, and foley catheter in hyperactive delirium; and 3) pain, sleep disorder, and haloperidol use in hypoactive delirium.
