32072889|t|An Upcoming Approach to Alzheimer's Disease: Ethnopharmacological Potential of Plant Bioactive Molecules.
32072889|a|BACKGROUND: Neurodegenerative disorders have achieved epidemic levels in the last decades; not only the elderly but also adult individuals have been increasingly affected. Among them, Alzheimer's disease is one of the most prevalent and crippling diseases, associated with high rates of multi-morbidities and dependency. Despite the existence of a wide variety of drugs used as the symptomatic treatment, they have some side effects and toxicity, apart from their limited effectiveness. Botanical preparations have a secular use, being widely recommended for a multitude of purposes, such as for the improvement of brain health. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present report is to systematize the knowledge on plant-food derived bioactive molecules with promising in vitro enzymatic inhibitory activities. RESULTS: Alkaloids, phenolic compounds and terpenes are the most studied phytochemicals, both derived from natural and commercial sources. In spite of their efficient activity as enzymatic inhibitors, the number of in vivo studies and even clinical trials have confirmed that their real bioactive potential remains scarce. CONCLUSION: Thus, it is of the utmost importance to deepen knowledge in this area, once those relevant and informative tools can significantly contribute to the promising advances in the field of Alzheimer's disease treatment.
