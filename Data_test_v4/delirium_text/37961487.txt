37961487|t|Sex-stratified phenotyping of comorbidities associated with an inpatient delirium diagnosis using real world data.
37961487|a|Delirium is a heterogeneous and detrimental mental condition often seen in older, hospitalized patients and is currently hard to predict. In this study, we leverage large-scale, real- world data using the electronic health records (EHR) to identify two cohorts comprised of 7,492 UCSF patients and 19,417 UC health system patients (excluding UCSF patients) with an inpatient delirium diagnosis and the same number of propensity score-matched control patients without delirium. We found significant associations between comorbidities or laboratory test values and an inpatient delirium diagnosis which were validated independently. Most of these associations were those previously-identified as risk factors for delirium, including metabolic abnormalities, mental health diagnoses, and infections. Some of the associations were sex- specific, including those related to dementia subtypes and infections. We further explored the diagnostic associations with anemia and bipolar disorder by conducting longitudinal analyses from the time of first diagnosis of the risk factor to development of delirium demonstrating a significant relationship across time. Finally, we show that an inpatient delirium diagnosis leads to dramatic increases in mortality outcome across both cohorts. These results demonstrate the powerful application of leveraging EHR data to shed insights into prior diagnoses and laboratory test values that could help predict development of inpatient delirium and emphasize the importance of considering patient demographic characteristics including documented sex when making these assessments. One Sentence Summary: Longitudinal analysis of electronic health record data reveals associations between inpatient delirium, comorbidities, and mortality.
