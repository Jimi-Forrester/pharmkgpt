33021707|t|The Physiology and Maintenance of Respiration: A Narrative Review.
33021707|a|Chronic pain is one of the most common reasons adults seek medical care and is often managed with opioid analgesics; however, opioids may cause respiratory depression by suppressing various components of respiration. Respiration is the physiological process that facilitates gas exchange and is mediated through the proper function of and communication among central neural control (respiratory drive), sensory input systems, the lungs, and the muscles involved in respiration. Normal respiratory function can be dampened with the use of central nervous system (CNS) depressants and/or underlying health conditions. Patients with chronic pain are often exposed to CNS depressants other than opioids, including benzodiazepines, barbiturates, nonbenzodiazepine sedative-hypnotics, and ethanol, which can function synergistically with opioids to increase the risk of respiratory depression. Some patients may also have underlying health issues, such as obstructive sleep apnea, that can be exacerbated with the use of opioids and other CNS depressants and further contribute to respiratory depression. Clinicians should have a thorough understanding of respiration, recognize how various CNS depressants suppress it, and take necessary steps to mitigate the risk of opioid-induced respiratory depression by collaborating with a multidisciplinary team (i.e., sleep and pain specialists), choosing appropriate medications, and educating patients on the proper use and storage of opioids.
