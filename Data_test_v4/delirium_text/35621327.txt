35621327|t|Cognitive Stimulation in Moderate Alzheimer's Disease.
35621327|a|Cognitive stimulation is one of the non-pharmacological therapies recommended for dementia intervention. The present study evaluated the efficacy of an intervention based on cognitive stimulation in people with moderate Alzheimer's disease. Fifty-nine subjects with moderate dementia were randomly assigned to the stimulation group (N = 36) and the control group (N = 35). The treatment group received 16 intervention sessions cognitive tasks. All participants were evaluated with a battery of neuropsychological tests at three time points (pre, post, and follow-up). The treatment group showed significant increases in the three domains studied (memory, attention, and executive functions), although some of these effects were not maintained at follow-up. The control group progressively worsened. Cognitive stimulation was found to be an effective intervention for people with moderate Alzheimer's disease because it helped to maintain memory function, executive functions, and attention. However, the effects were minimized at the 3-month follow-up.
