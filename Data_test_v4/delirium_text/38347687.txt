38347687|t|Teaching, assessment and best practice in undergraduate psychiatry education in the UK: cross-sectional survey.
38347687|a|AIMS AND METHOD: We conducted a cross-sectional survey to examine how undergraduate psychiatry is taught and assessed across medical schools in the UK that have at least one cohort of graduated students. RESULTS: In total, 27 medical schools completed the survey. Curriculum coverage of common mental disorders, assessment skills and mental health law was broadly consistent, although exposure to psychiatric subspecialties varied. Significant variation existed regarding the duration of psychiatry placements and availability of enrichment activities. Small-group teaching, lectures and e-learning were the most frequent teaching modalities and various professionals and lived experience educators (patient and/or carers) contributed to teaching. Objective structured clinical examinations and multiple-choice questions dominated assessments. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Medical schools should consider increasing students' exposure to different psychiatric subspecialties and integrating physical and mental health training to address comorbidity and promote holistic care. Future research should explore whether specific undergraduate experiences promote greater career interest and skills in psychiatry.
