6847136|t|Basal forebrain neurons in the dementia of Parkinson disease.
6847136|a|Demented patients with Parkinson disease share certain neuropathological and neurochemical features with patients suffering from Alzheimer disease. Recently, loss of cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain, particularly the nucleus basalis of Meynert, has been implicated in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer disease. The present investigations of 12 patients with Parkinson disease demonstrates that the demented patients with this disease also show a selective loss of cells in the nucleus basalis of Meynert, thus providing an important link between the dementias of Alzheimer disease and Parkinson disease.
