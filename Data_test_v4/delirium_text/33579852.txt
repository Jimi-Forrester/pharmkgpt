The ratio of toxic conformer to total Abeta42 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was significantly high in AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit with a 24B3 antibody. OBJECTIVE: We compared the toxic Abeta42, conformer at different stages of AD to identify its contribution to AD pathogenesis. METHODS: We compared 5 patients with preclinical AD, 11 patients with MCI due to AD, 21 patients with AD, and 5 healthy controls to measure CSF levels of total Abeta42, total tau, tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 (p-tau), and toxic Abeta conformers. All were classified using the Clinical Dementia Rating. Cognitive function was assessed using the Japanese version of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE-J). RESULTS: Toxic Abeta conformer level was insignificant between groups, but its ratio to Abeta42 was significantly higher in AD than in preclinical AD (p < 0.05). Toxic Abeta42 conformer correlated positively with p-tau (r = 0.67, p < 0.01) and p-tau correlated negatively with MMSE-J (r = -0.38, p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Toxic Abeta conformer triggers tau accumulation leading to neuronal impairment in AD pathogenesis.
