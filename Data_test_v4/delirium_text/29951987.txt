29951987|a|Esophagectomy remains the mainstay of curative intent treatment for esophageal cancer. Oncologic esophagectomy is a highly invasive surgery and both morbidity and mortality rates still remain high. Recently, it has been revealed that multidisciplinary perioperative management can decrease the postoperative complications after esophagectomy. In this review, we summarized the recent progress in each component of multidisciplinary perioperative care bundle, including oral hygiene, cessation of smoking and alcohol, respiratory training, measurement of physical fitness, swallowing evaluation and rehabilitation, nutritional support, pain control and management of delirium. The accumulation of evidence and the popularization of knowledge will increase safety of esophagectomy and thus improve the outcome of patients with esophageal cancer.
