35648367|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prominent neurodegenerative disease represented by the loss of memory and cognitive impairment symptoms and is one of the major health imperilments among the elderly. Amyloid (Abeta) deposit inside the neuron is one of the characteristic pathological hallmarks of this disease, leading to neuronal cell death. In the amyloidogenic processing, the amyloid precursor protein (APP) is cleaved by beta-secretase and gamma-secretase to generate Abeta. Methamphetamine (METH) is a psychostimulant drug that causes neurodegeneration and detrimental cognitive deficits. The analogy between the neurotoxic and neurodegenerative profile of METH and AD pathology necessitates an exploration of the underlying molecular mechanisms. In the present study, we found that METH ineluctably affects APP processing, which might contribute to the marked production of Abeta in human neuroblastoma cells. Melatonin, an indolamine produced and released by the pineal gland as well as other extrapineal, has been protective against METH-induced neurodegenerative processes, thus rescuing neuronal cell death. However, the precise action of melatonin on METH has yet to be determined. We further propose to investigate the protective properties of melatonin on METH-induced APP-cleaving secretases. Pretreatment with melatonin significantly reversed METH-induced APP-cleaving secretases and Abeta production. In addition, pretreatment with luzindole, a melatonin receptor antagonist, significantly prevented the protective effect of melatonin, suggesting that the attenuation of the toxic effect on METH-induced APP processing by melatonin was mediated via melatonin receptor. The present results suggested that melatonin has a beneficial role in preventing Abeta generation in a cellular model of METH-induced AD.
