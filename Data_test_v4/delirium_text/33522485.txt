33522485|t|The genetic landscape for amyloid beta fibril nucleation accurately discriminates familial Alzheimer's disease mutations.
33522485|a|Plaques of the amyloid beta (Ass) peptide are a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia. Mutations in Ass also cause familial forms of AD (fAD). Here, we use deep mutational scanning to quantify the effects of >14,000 mutations on the aggregation of Ass. The resulting genetic landscape reveals mechanistic insights into fibril nucleation, including the importance of charge and gatekeeper residues in the disordered region outside of the amyloid core in preventing nucleation. Strikingly, unlike computational predictors and previous measurements, the empirical nucleation scores accurately identify all known dominant fAD mutations in Ass, genetically validating that the mechanism of nucleation in a cell-based assay is likely to be very similar to the mechanism that causes the human disease. These results provide the first comprehensive atlas of how mutations alter the formation of any amyloid fibril and a resource for the interpretation of genetic variation in Ass.
