21995415|a|gamma-Secretase modulators (GSMs) have received much attention as potential therapeutic agents for Alzheimer's disease (AD). GSMs increase the ratio between short and long forms of the amyloid-beta (Abeta) polypeptides produced by gamma-secretase and thereby decrease the amount of the toxic amyloid species. However, the mechanism of action of these agents is still poorly understood. One recent paper [Richter et al. (2010) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.107, 14597-14602] presented data that were interpreted to support direct binding of the GSM sulindac sulfide to Abeta(42), supporting the notion that GSM action is linked to direct binding of these compounds to the Abeta domain of its immediate precursor, the 99-residue C-terminal domain of the amyloid precursor protein (C99, also known as the beta-CTF). Here, contrasting results are presented that indicate there is no interaction between monomeric sulindac sulfide and monomeric forms of Abeta42. Instead, it was observed that sulindac sulfide is itself prone to form aggregates that can bind nonspecifically to Abeta42 and trigger its aggregation. This observation, combined with data from previous work [Beel et al. (2009) Biochemistry48, 11837-11839], suggests both that the poor behavior of some NSAID-based GSMs in solution may obscure results of binding assays and that NSAID-based GSMs do not function by directly targeting C99. It was also observed that another GSM, flurbiprofen, fails to bind to monomeric Abeta42 or to C99 reconstituted into bilayered lipid vesicles. These results disfavor the hypothesis that these NSAID-based GSMs exert their modulatory effect by directly targeting a site located in the Abeta42 domain of free C99.
