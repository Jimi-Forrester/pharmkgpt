There were two mechanisms of injuries: cuts in 15 (78.9%) patients and stabs in 4 (21.10%). 9 injured patients had cut structures and open pharynx, 6 patients injured larynx and trachea, 2 injured only trachea and 2 patients injured pharynx and larynx. 3 (15.8%) patients had knife self-injuries on other parts of the body too, that is injuries of abdomen, top of the right lung lobe and wrist. The diagnosis was based on anamnestic data, clinical check-up, pharyngeal, laryngeal and esophageal directoscopy. Surgery was performed in less than 24 hours after injury. Injuries were successfully taken care of and swallowing, breathing and phonation were reestablished in 16 (84.2%) patients. Total laryngectomy with pharyngoplasty was performed in one patient with serious hypopharyngeal and esophageal injuries. Two patients (10.5%) died: one in the state of delirium tremens and one in serious hemorrhagic and traumatic shock.
