1808499|t|[EEG in elderly cardiac patients without cerebral lesions].
1808499|a|Ageing is known to be accelerated by risk-factors. The continuity between normal and pathological ageing is still quite disputed. Concerning cerebral ageing, the use of statistical methods on electroencephalographic (EEG) parameters appeared to be interesting. In this study, three different groups of elderly subjects were examined by EEG: normal subjects without neurological nor cardiac disease, subjects with Alzheimer-dementia (AD) and cardiac patients without cerebral clinical signs. Stepwise discriminant analysis showed that EEG-parameters discriminating normal subjects from cardiac patients were different from those discriminating AD-patients from normal. Furthermore, AD-patients could be well-discriminated from elderly cardiac patients.
