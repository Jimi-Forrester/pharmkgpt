38137648|t|The Impact of Regional Nerve Blocks on Postoperative Delirium or Cognitive Dysfunction following Thoracic Surgery: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
38137648|a|Regional nerve blocks (NBs) mitigate the occurrence of postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) and postoperative delirium (POD) in adult patients undergoing thoracic surgery. This study aimed to determine the exact effect of NBs on POCD and POD. Electronic databases, including PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Scopus, and Web of Science, were searched for studies. The primary outcome was the incidence of POD or POCD. The secondary outcome was pain scores assessed 24 and 48 h postoperatively. We calculated the log odds ratio (LOR) and standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The LOR was converted to an odds ratio (OR). In the analysis of 1010 patients from seven randomized controlled trials, POD and POCD rates were 14.1% and 16.7%, respectively, in the NB group, and higher, at 27.3% and 35.2%, in the control group. NBs reduced the incidence of POD (OR, 0.44; 95%CI 0.30 to 0.64; p < 0.001; I2 = 0.00%) and POCD (OR, 0.43; 95%CI 0.24 to 0.76; p < 0.001; I2 = 0.00%). NBs reduced pain scores at 24 h (SMD, -2.60; 95%CI -3.90 to -1.30, p < 0.001; I2 = 97.68%) and 48 h (SMD, -1.80; 95%CI -3.18 to -0.41, p = 0.01; I2 = 98.14%) postoperatively. NBs mitigated the occurrence of POD and POCD in adult patients after thoracic surgery.
