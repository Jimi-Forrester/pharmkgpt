35785723|t|Regioselective pyrrolizidine bis-spirooxindoles as efficient anti-amyloidogenic agents.
35785723|a|Here, we report a microwave-assisted, one-pot, three-component, 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction to produce highly regioselective and stereoselective bis-spirooxindoles as potential inhibitors against amyloid-beta fibrillation. Ease of synthesis, promising anti-amyloidogenic activity, low toxicity, and in vitro blood brain barrier permeability makes these compounds attractive therapeutic leads to treat Alzheimer's disease.
