39763384|t|Cerebral perfusion alterations in healthy young adults due to two genetic risk factors of Alzheimer's disease: APOE and MAPT.
39763384|a|Functional brain changes such as altered cerebral blood flow occur long before the onset of clinical symptoms in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative disorders. While cerebral hypoperfusion occurs in established AD, middle-aged carriers of genetic risk factors for AD, including APOE epsilon4, display regional hyperperfusion due to hypothesised pleiotropic or compensatory effects, representing a possible early biomarker of AD and facilitating earlier AD diagnosis. However, it is not clear whether hyperperfusion already exists even earlier in life. Here, 160 young and cognitively healthy participants from the Chinese PREVENT cohort underwent 3 T arterial spin labelling and T1 MRI and genetic testing for APOE and MAPT rs242557 status. Using FSL, we performed a whole brain voxel-wise analysis and a global mean grey matter analysis comparing for the effects of both risk genes on cerebral perfusion. No significant alterations were seen for APOE genotype, but in MAPT rs242557 A carriers, we observed a significantly hyperperfusion in the left anterior cingulate cortex and left insular cortex. There were no effects of APOE or MAPT status on the global perfusion. These results are novel and may suggest that MAPT genotypes demonstrated a distinct hemodynamic profile in a very young age.
