37630345|t|The Use of Ultrasound-Assisted Maceration for the Extraction of Carnosic Acid and Carnosol from Sage (Salvia officinalis L.) Directly into Fish Oil.
37630345|a|The aim of the study was to examine the effect of ultrasonic maceration (U) on the extraction of carnosic acid (CA) and its derivative-carnosol (C)-directly from sage into fish oil, compared to homogenization-assisted maceration (H). It was shown that the ultrasonic maceration process (U) allowed for obtaining a macerate enriched in carnosic acid (CA) and carnosol (C), also containing rosmarinic acid (RA), total polyphenols, and plant pigments, and showing antioxidant properties (DPPH test). There was no unequivocal difference in the efficiency of extracting ingredients from sage into the oil macerate between U and H, with the use of ultrasound in most cases resulting in a greater extraction of C and less extraction of pigments from sage into the macerate than in H. The highest simultaneous contents of CA (147.5 mg/100 g) and C (42.7 mg/100 g) in the macerate were obtained after 60 min of maceration U when using a higher power (320 W). The amount of determined compounds also depended on the concentration of methanol (methanol; 70% methanol) used for the analysis. The maceration U is a simple, safe, "green method" of obtaining active substances, with a reduced number of steps, enabling an interesting application form of CA and C, e.g., for food or cosmetics.
