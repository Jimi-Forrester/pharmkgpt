12354286|a|Macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) and its receptor are up-regulated in the brain in Alzheimer's disease (AD), in transgenic mouse models for AD, and experimental models for traumatic and ischemic brain injury. M-CSF induces activation and proliferation of microglial cells and expression of proinflammatory cytokines. We examined the role of M-CSF in excitotoxic neuronal cell death in organotypic hippocampal cultures. NMDA treatment induced neuronal apoptosis and caspase-3 activation in organotypic hippocampal cultures, whereas treatment with M-CSF protected hippocampal neurons from NMDA-induced apoptosis. Caspase-3 activation was inhibited by M-CSF treatment to the same degree as with the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK. These results suggest that M-CSF has neuroprotective properties through inhibition of caspase-3 that could promote neuronal survival after excitotoxic insult. The role of M-CSF in neurological disease should be reevaluated as a microglial activator with potentially neuroprotective effects.
