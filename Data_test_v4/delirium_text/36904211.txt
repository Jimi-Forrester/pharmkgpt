36904211|t|The Role of Phytochemicals and Gut Microbiome in Atherosclerosis in Preclinical Mouse Models.
36904211|a|Gut microbiome alterations have recently been linked to many chronic conditions including cardiovascular disease (CVD). There is an interplay between diet and the resident gut microbiome, where the food eaten affects populations of certain microbes. This is important, as different microbes are associated with various pathologies, as they can produce compounds that are disease-promoting or disease-protecting. The Western diet negatively affects the host gut microbiome, ultimately resulting in heightened arterial inflammation and cell phenotype changes as well as plaque accumulation in the arteries. Nutritional interventions including whole foods rich in fiber and phytochemicals as well as isolated compounds including polyphenols and traditional medicinal plants show promise in positively influencing the host gut microbiome to alleviate atherosclerosis. This review investigates the efficacy of a vast array of foods and phytochemicals on host gut microbes and atherosclerotic burden in mice. Reduction in plaque by interventions was associated with increases in bacterial diversity, reduction in the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes (F/B) ratio, and upregulation of Akkermansia. Upregulation in CYP7 isoform in the liver, ABC transporters, bile acid excretion, and the level of acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid were also noted in several studies reducing plaque. These changes were also associated with attenuated inflammation and oxidative stress. In conclusion, an increase in the abundance of Akkermansia with diets rich in polyphenols, fiber, and grains is likely to reduce plaque burden in patients suffering from CVD.
