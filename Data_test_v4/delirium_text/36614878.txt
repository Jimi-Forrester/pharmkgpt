36614878|t|Impact of Frailty Risk on Oral Intake and Length of Hospital Stay in Older Patients with Pneumonia: A Historical Cohort Study.
36614878|a|The aim of this study was to examine the association between frailty risk and outcomes in older patients with pneumonia. For this purpose, the JMDC multi-center database was used, and a historical cohort study was conducted to examine the association between the Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS) and oral intake prognosis and length of hospital stay in older patients hospitalized with pneumonia. Patients were classified into low-risk (HFRS < 5), intermediate-risk (HFRS = 5-15), and high-risk (HFRS > 15) groups based on their HFRS scores, and outcomes were defined as the number of days from admission to the start of oral intake and length of hospital stay. A total of 98,420 patients with pneumonia (mean age 82.2 +- 7.2) were finally included. Of these patients, 72,207 (73.4%) were in the low-risk group, 23,136 (23.5%) were in the intermediate-risk group, and 3077 (3.1%) were in the high-risk group. The intermediate- and high-risk groups had a higher number of days to the start of oral intake than the low-risk group (intermediate-risk group: coefficient 0.705, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.642-0.769; high-risk group: coefficient 0.889, 95% CI 0.740-1.038). In addition, the intermediate- and high-risk groups also had longer hospital stays than the low-risk group (intermediate-risk group: coefficient 5.743, 95% CI 5.305-6.180; high-risk group: coefficient 7.738, 95% CI 6.709-8.766). Overall, we found that HFRS is associated with delayed initiation of oral intake and prolonged hospital stay in older patients with pneumonia. Therefore, evaluation based on HFRS could be helpful in making clinical decisions regarding the selection of feeding strategies and when to discharge older patients with pneumonia.
