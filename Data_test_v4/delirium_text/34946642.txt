34946642|t|An Optimization Procedure for Preparing Aqueous CAR/HP-CD Aggregate Dispersions.
34946642|a|beta-Carotene is a very important molecule for human health. It finds a large application in the food industry, especially for the development of functional foods and dietary supplements. However, beta-carotene is an unstable compound and is sensitive to light, temperature, and oxygen. To overcome those limitations, various delivery systems were developed. The inclusion of beta-carotene by cyclodextrin aggregates is attractive due to non-toxicity, low hygroscopicity, stability, and the inexpensiveness of cyclodextrins. In this study, beta-carotene/2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin aggregates were prepared based on the procedure of the addition of beta-carotene in an organic solvent to the hot water dispersion of 2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin and the following instant evaporation of the organic solvent. The best conditions for the aggregate preparation were found to be as follows: 25% concentration of 2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin in water, 65  C temperature, and acetone for beta-carotene dissolution. The efficiency of entrapping was equal to 88%. The procedure is attractive due to the short time of the aggregate preparation.
