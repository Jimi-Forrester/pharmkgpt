35831706|t|Progress and Pitfalls in Developing Agents to Treat Neurocognitive Deficits Associated with Schizophrenia.
35831706|a|Cognitive impairments associated with schizophrenia (CIAS) represent a central element of the symptomatology of this severe mental disorder. CIAS substantially determine the disease prognosis and hardly, if at all, respond to treatment with currently available antipsychotics. Remarkably, all drugs presently approved for the treatment of schizophrenia are, to varying degrees, dopamine D2/D3 receptor blockers. In turn, rapidly growing evidence suggests the immense significance of systems other than the dopaminergic system in the genesis of CIAS. Accordingly, current efforts addressing the unmet needs of patients with schizophrenia are primarily based on interventions in other non-dopaminergic systems. In this review article, we provide a brief overview of the available evidence on the importance of specific systems in the development of CIAS. In addition, we describe the promising targets for the development of new drugs that have been used so far. In doing so, we present the most important candidates that have been investigated in the field of the specific systems in recent years and present a summary of the results available at the time of drafting this review (May 2022), as well as the currently ongoing studies.
