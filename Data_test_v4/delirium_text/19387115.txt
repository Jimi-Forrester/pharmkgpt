19387115|a|Diabetes mellitus and Alzheimer's disease (AD) each become increasingly common with age. Diabetes causes many chronic end-organ complications and among them is dementia, which may be due to an underlying vascular cause, as well as being related to AD. The pathogenic mechanisms that lead to diabetes complications include advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and growth factor dysregulation. This review explores the evidence for epidemiological links between diabetes and AD, as well as potential pathogenic mechanisms whereby AGEs, their cellular receptors, and key growth factors may contribute to AD development and progression in diabetes. Directions for future research are also discussed.
