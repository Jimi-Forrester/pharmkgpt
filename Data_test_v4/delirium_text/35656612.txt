35656612|t|[Detection, investigation, and management of delirium in hospitalized elderly].
35656612|a|Delirium is common in hospitalized older adults. The condition is frequently not recognized, or managed appropriately, and has a poor prognosis. This review finds that a proactive multicomponent interdisciplinary non-farmacological approach can reduce incidence. Delirium is managed by identification of the condition, accurate diagnosis and treatment of the causes, and all other correctable contributing factors, using nonpharmacologic approaches. In some cases, and if required for patient safety, low doses of high-potency antipsychotic agents can be used, in lowest possible dose and for the shortest possible time.
