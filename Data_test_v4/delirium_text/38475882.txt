38475882|t|Identification of the prognostic value of LACTB2 and its correlation with immune infiltrates in ovarian cancer by integrated bioinformatics analyses.
38475882|a|Ovarian cancer (OC) is one of the most common reproductive tumors in women, whereas current treatment options are limited. beta-lactamase-like-protein 2 (LACTB2) has been observed to be associated with various cancers, but its function in OC is unknown. Therefore, we evaluate the prognostic value and the underlying function of LACTB2 in OC. In this study, high expression of LACTB2 was observed in OC compared with normal controls. Kaplan-Meier Plotter analysis revealed that overexpressed LACTB2 is strongly correlated with poor prognosis. We conducted GO/KEGG analysis to investigate the potential biological function of LACTB2 in OC. GESA analysis showed that LACTB2 was closely related to immune-related pathways. Subsequently, we explored the relationship between LACTB2 and 24 types of immune cells in OC. The results suggested that LACTB2 was positively associated with multiple tumor-infiltrating immune cells. Importantly, LACTB2 may modulate immune cell infiltration in OC to influence prognosis. In conclusion, LACTB2 can be used as a promising prognostic biomarker and immunotherapy target for OC.
