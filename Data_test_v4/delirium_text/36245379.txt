36245379|t|Temporal Variation in Disease Onset and Clinical Features of Lewy Body Disease in China.
36245379|a|BACKGROUND: Lewy body dementia is the second most common neurodegenerative dementia, but data concerning the onset age and clinical features in the prodromal stage remain limited in China. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the associations between onset age and clinical manifestations of cognitive impairment with Lewy bodies in a large-sample cohort. METHODS: We included 74 patients with mild cognitive impairment with Lewy bodies (MCI-LB), 533 patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), 118 patients with Parkinson's disease with MCI (PD-MCI), and 313 patients with Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) in this multicenter cohort from 22 memory clinics of China from 1 January 2018 to 31 March 2022. The onset age, clinical manifestations, and neuropsychological assessments were recorded and analyzed after reviewing the medical records. RESULTS: The average onset age of memory loss was 68.28 (+-7.00) years, and parkinsonism happened 2.00 (+-1.24) years later for patients with MCI-LB. The average onset age of parkinsonism was 60.56 (+-8.96) years, and the memory loss happened 3.49 (+-3.02) years later for patients with PD-MCI. Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder and visual hallucinations were frequently reported in MCI-LB, DLB, and PDD, while visual hallucinations were least frequently reported in PD-MCI. Lower scores of MMSE and depression, and higher scores of activities of daily living and delusions, were independently associated with older onset age in DLB. CONCLUSION: The onset of PD-MCI precedes MCI-LB, and memory loss occurs 3 years after parkinsonism. The onset age is associated with cognition and neuropsychiatric symptoms in process.
