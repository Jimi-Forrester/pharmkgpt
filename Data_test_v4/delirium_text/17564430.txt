17564430|t|Mechanism of copper(II) inhibiting Alzheimer's amyloid beta-peptide from aggregation: a molecular dynamics investigation.
17564430|a|The aggregation of an amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) into fibrils is a key pathological event in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Under certain conditions, Cu2+ markedly inhibits Abeta from aggregation and is considered as a potential factor in the normal brain preventing Abeta from aggregation. The possible mechanism of the inhibitory effect of Cu2+ was investigated for the first time by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. On the basis of the radial distribution function analysis of the MD data, a novel strategy, the Q function, was proposed to explore the binding sites of Cu2+ by evaluating the coordination priority of atoms in Abeta, and the [6-5-5] tri-ring 4N binding mode of the Cu2+-Abeta complexes was found. The mechanism of the conformational transition of Abeta from the beta conformation to distorted beta conformations, which destabilizes the aggregation of Abeta into fibrils, was also revealed. All the results provide helpful clues for an improved understanding of the role of Cu2+ in the pathogenesis of AD and contribute to the development of an anti-amyloid therapeutic strategy.
