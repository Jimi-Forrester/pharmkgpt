37038817|t|Association Between Serum Cystatin C and Cognitive Decline Independently from Creatinine: Evidence from Two Nationally Representative Aging Cohorts.
37038817|a|BACKGROUND: Studies on the association between cystatin C based estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFRcys) and cognitive outcomes yielded inconsistent results. OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to examine the potential association of eGFRcys with subsequent cognitive decline rate. METHODS: A total of 11,503 community-based participants were involved in our analyses, including 5,837 (aged 72.9+-6.3; 58.6% women) in the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) from the US and 5,666 (aged 58.1+-9.2; 49.0% women) in the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS). The association of eGFRcys with subsequent cognitive decline rate was evaluated by linear mixed models. RESULTS: During 85,266 person-years of follow-up, both baseline elevated serum cystatin C (-0.048 standard deviation [SD]/year per mg/L; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.060 to -0.036; p <  0.001) and decreased eGFRcys (0.026 SD/year per 30 mL/min/1.73m2; 95% CI, 0.020 to 0.032; p <  0.001) were associated with faster cognitive decline rate after full adjustment. Compared with those had eGFRcys >=90 mL/min/1.73m2, participants with eGFRcys between 60 to 90 mL/min/1.73m2 (-0.012 SD/year; 95% CI, -0.020 to -0.004; p = 0.004) and those with eGFRcys <60 mL/min/1.73m2 (-0.048 SD/year; 95% CI, -0.058 to -0.039; p <  0.001) experienced statistically significantly faster cognitive decline after adjustment. The associations were independent from serum creatinine/eGFRcre (eGFR that was calculated from serum creatinine). CONCLUSION: Decreased eGFRcys are significantly associated with faster cognitive decline after full adjustment, independently from serum creatinine/eGFRcre. Serum cystatin C might be a risk factor or a prodromal biomarker of cognitive decline.
