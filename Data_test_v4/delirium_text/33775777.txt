33775777|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common age-related neurodegenerative disease, associated with several pathophysiological complaints. Impaired insulin signaling in the brain, is one of the important characteristic features of AD which is accompanied by cognitive deficits. According to the multifactorial and complicated pathology of AD, no modifying therapy has been approved yet. Imipramine is a kind of tricyclic antidepressant with reported anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant effects in the brain. There are controversial studies about the effect of this drug on spatial memory. This study investigates the effect of imipramine on streptozotocin (STZ) induced memory impairment in rats. Pursuing this objective, rats were treated with imipramine 10 or 20 mg/kg i.p. once a day for 14 days. 24 h after the last injection, memory function was evaluated by the Morris water maze (MWM) test in 4 consecutive days. Then, hippocampi were removed and the activity of caspase-3, mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs) family and inhibitory phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1ser307) were analyzed using Western blotting. Results showed that imipramine prevents memory impairment in STZ induced rats and this improvement was accompanied with an increase in ERK activity, reduction of caspase-3 and JNK activity, as well as partial restoration of P38 and IRS-1 activity. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that at least some members of the MAPK family are involved in the neuroprotective effect of imipramine.
