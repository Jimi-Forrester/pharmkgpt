33717233|a|The present study aimed to explore the pathogenesis behind post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE). In the present study, a chloride ferric injection-induced rat PTE model was established. The expression levels of apoptosis-antagonizing transcription factor (AATF), cleaved caspase-3, p53, Bcl-2 and Bax were measured by western blotting or immunofluorescence staining (IF). The expression of AATF in vivo was downregulated by microinjection of lentiviral-mediated short-hairpin RNA. Compared with control and sham groups, at day 5 after PTE, neuron apoptosis was significantly increased and the expression levels of AATF, p53, cleaved caspase-3 and Bax were significantly upregulated. In addition, IF revealed co-localization of AATF and cleaved caspase-3 in the cortex. Additionally, AATF was expressed mainly in neurons and astrocytes. Following AATF inhibition, the expression levels of p53 and cleaved caspase-3 were significantly reduced as compared with the control group. Taken together, these findings suggested that following PTE, AATF is involved in neuronal apoptosis and may serve as a potential target for its alleviation.
