33083713|a|Dityrosine (DiY), via the cross-linking of tyrosine residues, is a marker of protein oxidation, which increases with aging. Amyloid-beta (Abeta) forms DiY in vitro and DiY-cross-linked Abeta is found in the brains of patients with Alzheimer disease. Metal- or UV- catalyzed oxidation of Abeta42 results in an increase in DiY cross-links. Using DiY as a marker of oxidation, we compare the self-assembly propensity and DiY cross-link formation for a non-assembly competent variant of Abeta42 (vAbeta) with wild-type Abeta42. Oxidation results in the formation of trapped wild-type Abeta assemblies with increased DiY cross-links that are unable to elongate further. Assembly-incompetent vAbeta and trapped Abeta assemblies are non-toxic to neuroblastoma cells at all stages of self-assembly, in contrast to oligomeric, non-cross-linked Abeta. These findings point to a mechanism of toxicity that necessitates dynamic self-assembly whereby trapped Abeta assemblies and assembly-incompetent variant Abeta are unable to result in cell death.
