32420904|a|Chronic insomnia is the most common sleep disorder in the elderly population. From 9 to 50% of patients suffer of paradoxical insomnia, with the same symptoms and ailments, though characterized by normal sleep patterns. We have investigated the level of parameters related to stress in a group of post-menopausal female patients (age range 55-70 years) suffering by either objective or paradoxical insomnia, in particular we have measured 24-hours urinary cortisol, allostatic load index, Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score, and, for the first time, mitokines (mitochondrial stress response molecules) such as FGF21, GDF15 and Humanin (HN). Results show that the two groups are different as far as sleep efficiency score, as expected, but not for stress parameters, that in some cases resulted within the normality range, although quite close to the top threshold (such as cortisol) or much higher with respect to normality ranges (such as PSS). Therefore, the consequences of paradoxical insomnia on the expression of these parameters are the same as objective insomnia. As far as the level of mitokines, we showed that FGF21 and HN in particular resulted altered (decreased and increased, respectively) with respect to control population, however with no difference between the two groups of patients.
