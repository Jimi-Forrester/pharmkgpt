30226897|a|Oligomerization of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides has been considered as the crucially causative agent in the development of Alzheimer's disease. Etersalate, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory oral drug (United State Food and Drug Administration-Unique Ingredient Identifier: 653GN04T2G) was previously suggested to bind well to proto-fibrils of Abeta peptides in silico. Here, the effect of etersalate on the oligomerization of soluble Abeta16-22 hexamer (6Abeta16-22) were extensively investigated using temperature replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) simulations over ~16.8 mus in total for 48 replicas (350 ns per replica). The results reveal that etersalate can enter the inner space or bind on the surface of 6Abeta16-22 conformations, which destabilizes the hexamer. Etersalate was predicted to able to cross the blood brain barrier using prediction of absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion-toxicity (preADMET) tools. Overall, although the investigation was performed with the low concentration of trial inhibitor, the obtained results indicate that etersalate is a potential drug candidate for AD through inhibiting formation of Abeta oligomers with the average binding free energy of -11.7 kcal/mol.
