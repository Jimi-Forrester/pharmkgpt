35303671|a|Characterizing age- and risk-related hippocampal vulnerabilities may inform about the neural underpinnings of cognitive decline. We studied the impact of three risk-factors, Apolipoprotein (APOE)-epsilon4, a family history of dementia, and central obesity, on the CA1, CA2/3, dentate gyrus and subiculum of 158 cognitively healthy adults (38-71 years). Subfields were labelled with the Automatic Segmentation of Hippocampal Subfields and FreeSurfer (version 6) protocols. Volumetric and microstructural measurements from quantitative magnetization transfer and Neurite Orientation Density and Dispersion Imaging were extracted for each subfield and reduced to three principal components capturing apparent myelin/neurite packing, size/complexity, and metabolism. Aging was associated with an inverse U-shaped curve on myelin/neurite packing and affected all subfields. Obesity led to reductions in myelin/neurite packing and size/complexity regardless of APOE and family history of dementia status. However, amongst individuals with a healthy Waist-Hip-Ratio, APOE epsilon4 carriers showed lower size/complexity than non-carriers. Segmentation protocol type did not affect this risk pattern. These findings reveal interactive effects between APOE and central obesity on the hippocampal formation of cognitively healthy adults.
