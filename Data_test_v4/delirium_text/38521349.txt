38521349|t|Autorepression of Yeast Hsp70 co-chaperones by intramolecular interactions involving their J-domains.
38521349|a|The Hsp70 chaperones control protein homeostasis in all ATP-containing cellular compartments. J-domain proteins (JDPs) co-evolved with Hsp70s to trigger ATP-hydrolysis and catalytically upload various substrate polypeptides in need to be structurally modified by the chaperone. Here, we measured the protein disaggregation and refolding activities of the main yeast cytosolic Hsp70, Ssa1, in the presence of its most abundant JDPs, Sis1 and Ydj1, and two swap mutants, in which the J-domains have been interchanged. The observed differences by which the four constructs differently cooperate with Ssa1 and cooperate with each other, as well as their observed intrinsic ability to bind misfolded substrates and trigger Ssa1's ATPase, indicate the presence of yet uncharacterized intra-molecular dynamic interactions between the J-domains and the remaining C-terminal segments of these proteins. Taken together, the data suggest an auto-regulatory role to these intra-molecular interactions within both type A and B JDPs, which might have evolved to reduce energy-costly ATPase cycles by the Ssa1-4 chaperones that are the most abundant Hsp70s in the yeast cytosol.
