8145724|t|Secondary structure of amyloid beta peptide correlates with neurotoxic activity in vitro.
8145724|a|Amyloid beta peptide (A beta), the major protein constituent of senile plaques in patients with Alzheimer's disease, is believed to facilitate the progressive neurodegeneration that occurs in the latter stages of this disease. Early attempts to characterize the structure-activity relationship of A beta toxicity in vitro were compromised by the inability to reproducibly elicit A beta-dependent toxicity across different lots of chemically equivalent peptides. In this study we used CD spectroscopy to demonstrate that A beta secondary structure is an important determinant of A beta toxicity. Solubilized A beta was maximally toxic when the peptide adopted a beta-sheet conformation. Three of the four A beta lots tested had a random coil conformation and were weakly toxic or inactive, whereas the single A beta lot exhibiting toxic activity at low peptide concentrations had significant beta-sheet structure. Incubation of the weakly toxic A beta lots in aqueous stock solutions for several days before use induced a time-dependent conformational transition from random coil to beta-sheet and increased A beta toxicity in three different toxicity assays. Furthermore, the secondary structure of preincubated A beta was dependent upon peptide concentration and pH, so that beta-sheet structures were attenuated when peptide solutions were diluted or buffered at neutral and basic pH. Our data could explain some of the variable toxic activity that has been associated with A beta in the past and provide additional support for the hypothesis that A beta can have a causal role in the molecular neuropathology of Alzheimer's disease.
