39114535|t|Screening of preoperative obstructive sleep apnea by cardiopulmonary coupling and its risk factors in patients with plans to receive surgery under general anesthesia: a cross-sectional study.
39114535|a|Objective: Preoperative obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is supposed to be the abnormally high occurrence of OSA the night before surgery under general anesthesia. This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence preoperative OSA using cardiopulmonary coupling (CPC) and its correlation with imbalance of sympathetic/parasympathetic nervous system. Methods: A total of 550 patients with plans to receive surgery under general anesthesia were enrolled. All patients were assigned to wear CPC on the night before surgery until the next day. Sleep quality characteristics, heart rate variation parameters, and apnea-hypopnea index were acquired. The diagnosis of pre-existing OSA was not considered in the current study. Results: According to apnea-hypopnea index, 28.4%, 32.2%, 26.2%, and 13.3% patients were assessed as no, mild, moderate, and severe operative OSA, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression model revealed that higher age [p < 0.001, odds ratio (OR) = 1.043] was independently and positively associated with preoperative OSA; heart rate variation parameters representing the imbalance of sympathetic/parasympathetic nervous system, such as higher low-frequency (p < 0.001, OR = 1.004), higher low-frequency/high-frequency ratio (p = 0.028, OR = 1.738), lower NN20 count divided by the total number of all NN intervals (pNN20; p < 0.001, OR = 0.950), and lower high-frequency (p < 0.001, OR = 0.998), showed independent relationships with a higher probability of preoperative OSA. Higher age (p = 0.005, OR = 1.024), higher very-low-frequency (p < 0.001, OR = 1.001), and higher low-frequency/high-frequency ratio (p = 0.003, OR = 1.655) were associated with a higher probability of moderate-to-severe preoperative OSA, but higher pNN10 (p < 0.001, OR = 0.951) was associated with a lower probability of moderate-to-severe preoperative OSA. Conclusion: Preoperative OSA is prevalent. Higher age and imbalance of sympathetic/parasympathetic nervous system are independently and positively associated with a higher occurrence of preoperative OSA. CPC screening may promote the management of preoperative OSA.
