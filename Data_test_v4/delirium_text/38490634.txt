38490634|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the primary reason for disability of the elderly. This article studied the diagnostic possibility of TUG1 and its potential mechanism in the regulation of aerobic exercise (AE) on AD. METHODS: 77 AD patients undertook a three-month-long cycling exercise, and 77 healthy controls were recruited. Polymerase Chain Reaction amplification was applied to assess the expression of TUG1 and miR-129-5p. The diagnostic possibility was manifested by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Spearman correlation analyzed the interrelationships between TUG1 and AD. In vivo, the APP/PS1 double transgenic mouse models of AD were included for rescue experiments. Morris water maze (MWM) was performed to assess cognitive function of AD mice. RESULTS: The content of TUG1 was ascended in AD patients and was diminished after AE. The increase of TUG1 indicated the high risk of the occurrence of AD. TUG1 was closely connected to the cognitive assessment tools of AD patients. The TUG1/ miR-129-5p axis was the regulator of the regulation of AE in AD mice. CONCLUSION: TUG1 was involved in AD development and targeted miR-129-5p to participate in the regulation of AE.
