30483306|t|Demographics, Clinical Characteristics, and Therapeutic Approaches among Older Adults Referred to Mobile Psychiatric Crisis Intervention Teams: A Retrospective Study.
30483306|a|BACKGROUND / AIMS: The advent of mobile old age psychiatry intervention teams supports policies maintaining older adults in their habitual living environments, even those who are very old and suffering from acute cognitive and psychiatric impairments. Analyzing sociodemographic data, clinical and health characteristics, reasons for crisis-oriented psychiatric consultations, and other therapeutic suggestions for supporting home- or nursing home-dwelling older adult patients suffering from an onset of a psychiatric crisis. METHODS: Reviews of the medical records and discharge letters of home- or nursing home-dwelling older adults who had undergone a consultation with the Lausanne region's Mobile Old Age Psychiatry Teams (MOAPTs), between May 2016 and December 2017. RESULTS: Of 570 older adult patients referred for consultation with MOAPTs, 333 had medical records and discharge letters eligible for retrospective analysis (59%). The majority of these older adult patients were women aged over 80 years suffering from dementia, mood disorders with and without a risk of suicide, and delirium. Challenging behaviors related to different stages of cognitive impairment were the most important clinical reason for crisis consultations. Nonpharmacological and pharmacological treatments were delivered concurrently in 68% of crisis consultations. CONCLUSION: Appropriate responses by dual nurse-psychiatrist teams using crisis-oriented nonpharmacological and pharmacological interventions decreased hospitalization.
