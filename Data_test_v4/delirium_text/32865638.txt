32865638|t|COVID-19 and its impact on neurological manifestations and mental health: the present scenario.
32865638|a|Though the COVID-19 pandemic primarily affects pulmonary and cardiorenal functions, many healthcare and its allied groups reported neurological involvement of SARS-CoV-2 in combination with either pre-existing metabolic abnormalities, medical conditions, infections or even chronic to acute inflammatory episodes of the nervous system. The present review provides a fair outlook of the published literature and also the case reports with an emphasis on plausible mechanisms involved in neurological complications of the central and peripheral nervous systems. Awareness on the neuropsychiatric manifestations being discussed in this article should ideally help the medical community in early identification and effective management of potentially life-threatening neurological diseases.
