37238946|t|RNA Therapeutics: A Healthcare Paradigm Shift.
37238946|a|COVID-19 brought about the mRNA vaccine and a paradigm shift to a new mode of treating and preventing diseases. Synthetic RNA products are a low-cost solution based on a novel method of using nucleosides to act as an innate medicine factory with unlimited therapeutic possibilities. In addition to the common perception of vaccines preventing infections, the newer applications of RNA therapies include preventing autoimmune disorders, such as diabetes, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and Down syndrome; now, we can deliver monoclonal antibodies, hormones, cytokines, and other complex proteins, reducing the manufacturing hurdles associated with these products. Newer PCR technology removes the need for the bacterial expression of DNA, making mRNA a truly synthetic product. AI-driven product design expands the applications of mRNA technology to repurpose therapeutic proteins and test their safety and efficacy quickly. As the industry focuses on mRNA, many novel opportunities will arise, as hundreds of products under development will bring new perspectives based on this significant paradigm shift-finding newer solutions to existing challenges in healthcare.
