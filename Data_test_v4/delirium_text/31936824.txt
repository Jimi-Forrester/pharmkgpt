31936824|a|Sepsis is a common cause of delirium in the intensive care unit (ICU). Recently, vitamin C and thiamine administration has been gaining interest as a potential adjunct therapy for sepsis. We investigated the impact of early vitamin C and thiamine administration on ICU delirium-free days among critically ill patients in septic shock. We performed a single-center, retrospective study of patients who visited the emergency department (ED) from January 2017 to July 2018. We categorized patients into a treatment (received vitamin C and thiamine) and control group. We compared delirium-free days within 14 days after ICU admission using propensity score matching. Of 435 patients with septic shock, we assigned 89 propensity score-matched pairs to the treatment and control groups. The median delirium-free days did not differ between treatment (11, interquartile range [IQR] 5-14 days) and control (12, IQR 6-14 days) groups (p = 0.894). Secondary outcomes were not different between the two groups, including delirium incidence and 28-day mortality. These findings were consistent after subgroup analysis for patients who met the sepsis-3 definition of septic shock. Vitamin C and thiamine administration showed no association with ICU delirium-free days among patients in septic shock.
