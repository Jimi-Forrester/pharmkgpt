11510063|a|Postoperative delirium occurs frequently following major surgery, especially after hepatectomy. We hypothesized that better methods of postoperative pain control would decrease postoperative delirium. To clarify the magnitude of postoperative pain and incidence of postoperative delirium in hepatectomy patients, subjects received patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA) using bupivacaine and fentanyl (Group P), or continuous epidural mepivacaine (Group E) following intraoperative epidural administration of morphine. The magnitude of postoperative pain was estimated by use of an analgesic adjuvant and delirium was classified as mild (insomnia, disturbance of sleepwake cycle), moderate (disorientation, hallucination), or severe (restlessness, confusion, agitation), based on the medical records. Analgesic adjuvant usage was less in Group P than in Group E, while the incidences of moderate and severe delirium were significantly less frequent in Group P than in Group E (35.7% versus 75.0%, and 14.3% versus 50.0% respectively). Moreover, less amount of antipsychotic drugs was given in Group P than in Group E. These results suggest that the better pain relief and patient satisfaction provided by PCEA contributed to a decrease in the incidence of delirium, because of continuous opioid administration and patient-control analgesia. We concluded that PCEA with bupivacaine and fentanyl can limit postoperative delirium following hepatectomy.
