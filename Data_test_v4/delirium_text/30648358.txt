30648358|a|BACKGROUND: The Ginkgo biloba special extract, EGb 761  has been widely used in the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: To guide clinical practice in the Asian region, the Asian Clinical Expert Group on Neurocognitive Disorders compiled evidence-based consensus recommendations regarding the use of EGb 761  in neurocognitive disorders with/without cerebrovascular disease. RESULTS: Key randomized trials and robust meta-analyses have demonstrated significant improvement in cognitive function, neuropsychiatric symptoms, activities of daily living (ADL) and quality of life with EGb 761  versus placebo in patients with mild-to-moderate dementia. In those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), EGb 761  has also demonstrated significant symptomatic improvement versus placebo. World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry guidelines list EGb 761  with the same strength of evidence as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists e.g. memantine (Grade 3 recommendation; Level B evidence). Only EGb 761  had Level B evidence in improving cognition, behaviour, and ADL in both AD and vascular dementia patients. Safety analyses show EGb 761  to have a positive risk-benefit profile. While concerns have been raised regarding a possible increased bleeding risk, several randomized trials and two meta-analyses have not supported this association. CONCLUSIONS: The Expert Group foresee an important role for EGb 761  , used alone or as an add-on therapy, in the treatment of MCI and dementias, particularly when patients do not derive benefit from acetylcholinesterase inhibitors or NMDA antagonists. EGb 761  should be used in alignment with local clinical practice guidelines.
