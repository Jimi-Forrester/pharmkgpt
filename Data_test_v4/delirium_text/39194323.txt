39194323|t|Assessing Delirium Severity in Dementia: Item Development and Psychometric Validation for a Delirium Severity Instrument.
39194323|a|PURPOSE: Despite the importance of measuring delirium severity in patients with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD), no validated instrument currently exists. Our goal was to generate items for use in such an instrument. METHOD: An interdisciplinary expert panel developed items to assess seven domains and 21 subdomains of delirium severity. Nursing experts provided input on items. RESULTS: Experts achieved consensus on 21 items, including best respondents for each item, and appropriate look-back periods. Nursing experts emphasized the need for educating nursing staff and obtaining information from caregivers. CONCLUSION: Careful, nuanced identification of distinguishing features is key for generating items for measuring delirium severity in persons with ADRD. Once developed, engaging nurses will be essential to facilitate adoption and relevance of the tool. [Journal of Gerontological Nursing, 50(9), 24-30.].
