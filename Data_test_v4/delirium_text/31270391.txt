31270391|a|Introducing the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) algorithms to neural networks science eliminated the problem of arbitrary setting of the threshold for connectivity strength. Despite these advantages, MST has been rarely used to study network abnormalities in schizophrenia. An MST graph mapping a network structure is its simplification, therefore, it is important to verify whether the reconfigured network is significantly related to the behavioural dimensions of the clinical picture of schizophrenia. 35 first-episode schizophrenia patients and 35 matched healthy controls underwent an assessment of information processing speed, cognitive inter-trial variability modelled with ex-Gaussian distributional analysis of reaction times and resting-state EEG recordings to obtain frequency-specific functional connectivity matrices from which MST graphs were computed. The patients' network had a more random structure and star-like arrangement with overloaded hubs positioned more posteriorly than it was in the case of the control group. Deficient processing speed in the group of patients was predicted by increased maximal betweenness centrality in beta and gamma bands, while decreased consistency in cognitive processing was predicted by the betweenness centrality of posterior nodes in the gamma band, together with duration of illness. The betweenness centrality of posterior nodes in the gamma band was also significantly correlated with positive psychotic symptoms in the clinical group.
