We aimed to study the main risk factors for neurocognitive disorders and frailty in HIV older adults. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cross-sectional study with 40 HIV individuals older than 65 years under antiretroviral therapy in Hospital del Mar (Barcelona) recruited between November 2019 and October 2020. Data has been obtained through clinical scores and a blood sample to evaluate NI and frailty and has been analyzed with non-parametric tests and a multivariate logistic regression model. RESULTS: Among the 40 patients admitted for the study, 14 (35%) had positive screening for NI. We found that HIV individuals with nadir CD4+ T-cell count lower than 350 cells/mm3 had 39.7 more risk for NI (95% CI 2.49-632.10; p = 0.009). Those with a lower education level had 22.78 more risk for neurocognitive disorders (95% CI 2.13-242.71; p = 0.01) and suffering any comorbidity with a punctuation >= 1 in the Charlson Comorbidity index had an increased risk of 18.26 of developing NI and frailty (95% CI 1.30-256.33; p = 0.031), among them diabetes was significantly more frequent in NI. CONCLUSION: We observed that the main risk factors for a positive NI screening in HIV older adults were low education level, a nadir CD4+ T-cell count < 350 cells/mm3 and the presence of any comorbidity, highlighting diabetes among them.
