38627298|a|OBJECTIVES: This meta-analysis aimed to examine the safety of masitinib in patients with neurodegenerative diseases. METHODS: We considered randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing different doses of masitinib versus placebo. We performed our analysis using the R (v.4.3.0) programming language and the incidence of adverse events was pooled using risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: We included five RCTs, focusing on multiple sclerosis (MS), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The meta-analysis revealed a significantly higher incidence of adverse events in the masitinib group compared to the control group, regardless of adverse event grade and masitinib dose (RR = 1.12, 95% CI [1.07 to 1.17], P < 0.01). Adverse events categorized as severe, non-fatal serious, leading to dose reduction, and leading to permanent discontinuation also showed a higher incidence in the masitinib group (P <= 0.01). Subgroup analysis for AD and MS supported these findings. The pooled incidence of adverse events, regardless of their grade, was higher in the masitinib group for both the 3 mg/kg/d dose (RR = 1.13, P = 0.01) and the 4.5 mg/kg/d dose (RR = 1.11, P < 0.01). However, there was no significant difference between masitinib 3 mg/kg/d dose and placebo regarding severe and non-fatal serious adverse events for the. CONCLUSION: Masitinib use in neurodegenerative diseases presents safety concerns that may impact patients' quality of life and require management. Further research is recommended to determine the optimal dose with minimal safety concerns in this patient population.
