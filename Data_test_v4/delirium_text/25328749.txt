25328749|t|Magnetic resonance imaging in marchiafava-bignami syndrome: a cornerstone in diagnosis and prognosis.
25328749|a|Marchiafava-Bignami syndrome is a rare condition. However, with the advent of MRI, more and more of these cases are being diagnosed. Thus, it becomes essential for a radiologist to be familiar with its imaging features as well as clinical presentation. A 50-year-old chronic alcoholic presented to the emergency room with history of 3 episodes of seizures 2 days earlier. The patient had gait disturbances for the last few days. On examination, the patient was in a state of stupor. No neck rigidity was elicited. On MRI, the corpus callosum appeared diffusely hypointense on T1 weighted images and hyperintense on T2 weighted sequences without any evident enhancement after intravenous administration of Gadolinium. On fluid attenuation and inversion recovery images, central hypointensity with surrounding hyperintense rim involving the genu, body, and splenium of corpus callosum was noted. Additionally, cortical-subcortical signal intensity changes were also noted predominantly involving the right frontal lobe. On diffusion weighted imaging, all the above mentioned lesions showed restriction of diffusion. I am presenting here a case of Marchiafava-Bignami syndrome highlighting the role of MR imaging in diagnosing, prognosticating as well as in understanding the underlying pathophysiology of this rare clinical entity.
