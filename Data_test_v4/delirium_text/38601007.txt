38601007|a|The alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (alpha7-nAChR) has has long been considered a promising therapeutic target for addressing cognitive impairments associated with a spectrum of neurological and psychiatric disorders, including Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia. However, despite this potential, clinical trials employing alpha7-nAChR (partial) agonists such as TC-5619 and encenicline (EVP-6124) have fallen short in demonstrating sufficient efficacy. We here investigate the target engagement of TC-5619 and encenicline in the pig brain by use of the alpha7-nAChR radioligand 11C-NS14492 to characterize binding both with in vitro autoradiography and in vivo occupancy using positron emission tomography (PET). In vitro autoradiography demonstrates significant concentration-dependent binding of 11C-NS14492, and both TC-5619 and encenicline can block this binding. Of particular significance, our in vivo investigations demonstrate that TC-5619 achieves substantial alpha7-nAChR occupancy, effectively blocking approximately 40% of alpha7-nAChR binding, whereas encenicline exhibits more limited alpha7-nAChR occupancy. This study underscores the importance of preclinical PET imaging and target engagement analysis in informing clinical trial strategies, including dosing decisions.
