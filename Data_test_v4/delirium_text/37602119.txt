37602119|t|The Safety of Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy in Super-elderly Patients: A Propensity Score Matching Analysis.
37602119|a|BACKGROUND: Although reports on the safety of laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) exist, few have included patients aged >= 85 years. Hence, our study aimed to evaluate surgical outcomes of LC in patients aged >= 85 years. METHODS: After excluding patients who underwent other types of surgeries, 583 patients who underwent LC between 2015 and 2022 were included. Patients were classified into two groups based on age: < 85 years (control group, n = 551) and >= 85 years (super-elderly group, n = 32). Propensity score matching (PSM) was performed based on preoperative clinical parameters, and intraoperative and postoperative outcomes were compared. RESULTS: After PSM, 28 patients were included in each group. Intraoperative blood loss (1 vs. 5 mL, respectively; P = .052) and frequency of serious postoperative complications (Clavien-Dindo class >= 2, 2/28 (7.1%) vs. 6/28 (21.4%), P = .252) were similar between the control and elderly groups. There was no significant difference in the length of postoperative stay (control group: 5 (4-24) days vs. super-elderly group: 7 (3-64) days, P = .236). Unfortunately, one case of pneumonia of unknown cause occurred postoperatively, resulting in the death of one patient in the super-elderly group. CONCLUSIONS: There were no clinically significant differences in the short-term outcomes of LC between super-elderly patients aged >= 85 years and patients aged < 85 years. Hence, LC may be relatively safe even in patients aged >= 85 years. However, owing to many pre-existing diseases and deterioration of physiological function, careful management during the perioperative period is desirable.
