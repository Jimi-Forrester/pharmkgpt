30371652|t|[Pseudoexfoliation syndrom].
30371652|a|Pseudoexfoliation syndrome (PEX) is systematic microfibrylopathy associated with abnormalities of the accumulation of the extracellular matrix - buildup of protein clumps of abnormal basal membrane of trabecular epithelium, iris, ciliary body and lens capsule. The exfoliation material accumulates in anterior segment of a human eye (anterior lens capsule, ciliary zonule, ciliary body, iris, trabecular, anterior hyaloid membrane, conjunctiva) and other organs such as heart, connective tissue of lungs, vessels, skin, gallbladder, kidneys, liver, urinary bladder and meninges. People with PEX are more likely to develop cardio-vascular diseases, hearing loss and Alzheimer's disease as well.
