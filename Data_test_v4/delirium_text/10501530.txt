10501530|a|To investigate the neurobiological bases of visual hallucinations in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), regional cerebral glucose metabolism was compared among three patient groups; DLB with visual hallucinations, DLB without visual hallucinations and Alzheimer's disease (AD) without visual hallucinations. The regional metabolism was significantly lower in both DLB groups than in the AD group in the primary visual area and the posterior temporal, parietal and lateral occipital association areas. The hypometabolism in the right posterior temporal and parietal areas was significantly milder in DLB with visual hallucinations than in DLB without hallucinations. The hypometabolism in the primary visual cortex and the relatively preserved metabolism in the right temporoparietal association cortices may be associated with the occurrence of visual hallucinations in DLB patients.
