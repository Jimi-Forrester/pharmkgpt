21454701|a|The metabolism of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) has been extensively investigated because its processing generates the amyloid-beta-peptide (Abeta), which is a likely cause of Alzheimer disease. Much prior research has focused on APP processing using transgenic constructs and heterologous cell lines. Work to date in native neuronal cultures suggests that Abeta is produced in very large amounts. We sought to investigate APP metabolism and Abeta production simultaneously under more physiological conditions in vivo and in vitro using cultured rat cortical neurons and live pigs. We found in cultured neurons that both APP and Abeta are secreted rapidly and at extremely high rates into the extracellular space (2-4 molecules/neuron/s for Abeta). Little APP is degraded outside of the pathway that leads to extracellular release. Two metabolic pools of APP are identified, one that is metabolized extremely rapidly (t1/2;) = 2.2 h), and another, surface pool, composed of both synaptic and extrasynaptic elements, that turns over very slowly. Abeta release and accumulation in the extracellular medium can be accounted for stoichiometrically by the extracellular release of beta-cleaved forms of the APP ectodomain. Two alpha-cleavages of APP occur for every beta-cleavage. Consistent with the results seen in cultured neurons, an extremely high rate of Abeta production and secretion from the brain was seen in juvenile pigs. In summary, our experiments show an enormous and rapid production and extracellular release of Abeta and the soluble APP ectodomain. A small, slowly metabolized, surface pool of full-length APP is also identified.
