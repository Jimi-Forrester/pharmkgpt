36435362|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most devastating neurodegenerative disorder affecting the elderly. The exact pathology of AD is not yet fully understood and several hallmarks such as the deposition of amyloid-beta, tau hyperphosphorylation, and neuroinflammation, as well as mitochondrial, metal ions, autophagy, and cholinergic dysfunctions are known as pathologic features of AD. Since no definitive treatment has been proposed to target AD to date, many natural products have shown promising preventive potentials and contributed to slowing down the disease progression. Algae is a promising source of novel bioactive substances known to prevent neurodegenerative disorders including AD. In this context, fucoxanthin and astaxanthin, natural carotenoids abundant in algae, has shown to possess neuroprotective properties through antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory characteristics in modulating the symptoms of AD. Fucoxanthin and astaxanthin exhibit anti-AD activities by inhibition of AChE, BuChE, BACE-1, and MAO, suppression of Abeta accumulation. Also, fucoxanthin and astaxanthin inhibit apoptosis induced by Abeta1-42 and H2O2-induced cytotoxicity, and modulate the antioxidant enzymes (SOD and CAT), through inhibition of the ERK pathway. Moreover, cellular and animal studies on the beneficial effects of fucoxanthin and astaxanthin against AD were also reviewed. The potential role of fucoxanthin and astaxanthin exhibits great efficacy for the management of AD by acting on multiple targets.
