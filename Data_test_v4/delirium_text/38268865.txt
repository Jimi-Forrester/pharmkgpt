38268865|a|This study investigated the oxidative stability of instant fried noodles by applying free and microencapsulated black hollyhock extracts (BHE) and borage extracts (BE) (BE, BHE, ME-BE and ME-BHE). At first, the BE and BHE were encapsulated with whey protein and maltodextrin at a 90:10 ratio through a spray dryer. After evaluating particle characteristics (including anthocyanin content, zeta potential, polydispersity index (PDI), particle size, and morphology), they were added to the noodle formulation (wheat flour 78.5%, NaCl 0.78%, and water 21.21%) at 1% w/w level, and the physicochemical (proximate analysis, pH, color, cooking loss, and texture), sensory properties (taste, odor, color, texture, and overall acceptability), and oxidative stability (acid value, peroxide value, anisidine index, thiobarbituric acid index, conjugated dienes) of the fried noodles were studied. The results showed that the microcapsules had uneven shapes with angular surfaces. There was no significant difference between the zeta potential, particle size, PDI, and encapsulation efficiency of BE- and BHE-loaded microcapsules, and the values reported fell between -34.96 and -34.84 mV, 1.128 and 1.195 mum, 0.247 and 0.283, and 80.08% and 83.47%, respectively. Adding extracts to the functional noodles decreased cooking loss and pH compared to the control. The noodles exhibited a darker color. BE and BHE reduced the oxidation of fried noodle oil, with microencapsulated extracts showing stronger effects during storage (p < .05). Sensory evaluation indicated high acceptability for all samples. Encapsulation effectively preserves the natural antioxidant activities of BE and BHE, providing potential benefits for food processing and storage.
