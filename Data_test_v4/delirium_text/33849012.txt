33849012|a|OBJECTIVE: Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) dysregulation is widely related with various psychiatric and neurological disorders, including schizophrenia, depression, Rett syndrome, and addiction, and the available evidence suggests that BDNF is also highly correlated with Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. METHODS: The BDNF target sequence was detected on a capture probe attached on aluminum microcomb electrodes on the silicon wafer surface. A capture-target-reporter sandwich-type assay was performed to enhance the detection of the BDNF target. RESULTS: The limit of detection was noticed to be 100 aM. Input of a reporter sequence at concentrations >10 aM improved the detection of the target sequence by enhancing changes in the generated currents. Control experiments with noncomplementary and single- and triple-mismatches of target and reporter sequences did not elicit changes in current levels, indicating the selective detection of the BDNF gene sequence. CONCLUSION: The above detection strategy will be useful for the detection and quantification of BDNF, thereby aiding in the provision of suitable treatments for BDNF-related disorders.
