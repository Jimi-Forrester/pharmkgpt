29551918|a|BACKGROUND: Dexmedetomidine is a useful sedative agent for spinal anesthesia. However, it has been reported to decreases heart rate in a dose-dependent manner. In the present study, we compared the bolus dose of midazolam and bolus loaded dexmedetomidine over 10 min to determine additional sedation methods. METHODS: A total of 100 patients who were classified as American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I-II undergoing spinal anesthesia were randomly divided into two groups. In the combination of midazolam and dexmedetomidine group (group MD), 10 min after bolus loading of 0.05 mg/kg midazolam, 0.5 mug/kg/h dexmedetomidine was infused. In the dexmedetomidine group (group D), 1 mug/kg bolus dose of dexmedetomidine was infused over 10 min, and then 0.5 mug/kg/h dexmedetomidine was infused continuously. RESULTS: At 10 min, the sedation depth of the two groups was approximately the same. In both groups, the bispectral index (BIS) was within the optimal range of 55-80 and the Ramsay Sedation Scale score was within the optimal range of 3-5. Both patient and surgeon satisfaction with sedation did not differ between groups. At 10 min, heart rate (beats/min) was significantly lower (P < .01) in group D and mean blood pressure (mm Hg) was significantly lower (P < .01) in group MD. The prevalence of bradycardia (P = .714), hypotension (P = .089), and hypoxia (P = .495) did not differ statistically between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Midazolam bolus and dexmedetomidine continuous infusion may be a useful additional sedation method for patients who have severe bradycardia.
