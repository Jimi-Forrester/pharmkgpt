36986759|t|Dendrimers in Alzheimer's Disease: Recent Approaches in Multi-Targeting Strategies.
36986759|a|Nanomaterials play an increasingly important role in current medicinal practice. As one of the most significant causes of human mortality, and one that is increasing year by year, Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been the subject of a very great body of research and is an area in which nanomedicinal approaches show great promise. Dendrimers are a class of multivalent nanomaterials which can accommodate a wide range of modifications that enable them to be used as drug delivery systems. By means of suitable design, they can incorporate multiple functionalities to enable transport across the blood-brain barrier and subsequently target the diseased areas of the brain. In addition, a number of dendrimers by themselves often display therapeutic potential for AD. In this review, the various hypotheses relating to the development of AD and the proposed therapeutic interventions involving dendrimer-base systems are outlined. Special attention is focused on more recent results and on the importance of aspects such as oxidative stress, neuroinflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction in approaches to the design of new treatments.
