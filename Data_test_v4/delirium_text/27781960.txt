27781960|t|Angiotensin Mediated Oxidative Stress and Neuroprotective Potential of Antioxidants and AT1 Receptor Blockers.
27781960|a|Oxidative stress in brain underlies the major neurological disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Peripherally, Angiotensin-II is a major effector of inflammation. Identification of its capacity to access brain during hypertension, as well as location of central renin angiotensin system have led to its recognition as the major effector of oxidative stress in brain. Clinical uses of antioxidants to antagonize this oxidative stress have mostly failed. In this scenario, AT1 blockers have been investigated to prevent neurodegeneration. Although it has shown promise, clinical efficacy is limited to few drugs including telmisartan mainly due to the poor brain availability of others. In this review we aim to analyze the potential of antioxidants to reduce oxidative stress in brain. We have given critical analysis of the approaches for re-purposing of AT1 blockers against oxidative stress induced neurodegeneration.
