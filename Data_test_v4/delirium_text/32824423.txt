32824423|t|Metabolomic Analysis of Germinated Brown Rice at Different Germination Stages.
32824423|a|Brown rice (BR) is unpolished rice containing many bioactive compounds in addition to the basic nutrients of the rice grain. Herein, BR was germinated for up to 48 h to prepare germinated brown rice (GBR). The physiological and chemical changes in the GBR during germination were analyzed. GBR samples germinated for 48 h were in the radicle-emergence stage, but root formation was not observed. The change in the GBR metabolite profile during germination was analyzed to determine the effect of germination on the chemical profiles of the GBR samples. Twenty-five metabolites including acidic compounds, amino acids, sugars, lipid metabolites, and secondary metabolites were identified as the components that contributed to the variations in the GBR groups germinated for different time periods. Among the metabolites, the carbohydrates associated with energy production and lipid metabolites changed significantly. Based on the identified metabolites, a metabolomic pathway was proposed. Carbohydrate metabolism, citric acid cycle, and lipid metabolism were the main processes that were affected during germination. Although further studies on the relationship between the metabolite profile and nutritional quality of the GBR are needed, these results are useful for understanding the effect of germination on the physiological and chemical changes in BR.
