METHOD: An extensive review of related literature was conducted to determine the common causes of sleep disturbances in hospitalized patients, such as environmental, medical, psychological, and physiological factors. The case of Mrs. Z was used to illustrate how these factors interact in a clinical setting. FINDINGS: The study revealed a high prevalence of sleep disturbances in hospitalized patients, which can lead to significant adverse outcomes. A multidisciplinary approach involving physicians, nurses, pharmacists, and other healthcare professionals is essential to effectively manage sleep disorders due to the interplay of various factors. Nonpharmacological interventions are fundamental to a comprehensive sleep management plan. Pharmacotherapy may sometimes be necessary to improve sleep quality and duration. CONCLUSION: Health professionals can significantly enhance the sleep quality of hospitalized piatients by understanding the value of sleep and providing evidence-based strategies for improvement. In return, this improves patient outcomes, reduces healthcare costs, and advances general patient satisfaction.
