19401173|a|The effects of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) on astrocyte responses to activation of mGlu5 receptors have been investigated using calcium imaging. Pre-incubation with Abeta1-40 peptide for up to 72 h produced a time- and concentration-dependent 2-4 fold enhancement in the magnitude of the intracellular calcium mobilization response to the group I metabotropic glutamate receptor agonist (S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG). In contrast, pre-treatment with Abeta1-40 did not alter the calcium responses induced by other G protein coupled- or ion channel-receptors. Abeta 1-40-enhanced DHPG responses were blocked by the mGlu5 antagonist MPEP but not by inhibitors of voltage dependent calcium channels or by the AMPA/KA receptor antagonist CNQX. Up-regulation of mGlu5 coupled responses was associated with significant increases in astrocyte mGlu5 receptor-mRNA and-protein expression after preincubation with Abeta . The changes observed in vitro were consistent with results obtained from human Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients.Immunostaining for mGlu5 receptors was increased on astrocytes which were colocalized with Abeta plaques in hippocampal tissue from AD patients compared to age-matched controls. These results suggest that modulation of mGlu5 receptors in astrocytes could be an important mechanism in determining the progression of pathology in AD.
