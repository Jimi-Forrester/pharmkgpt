11505913|a|The study was made of 17 patients with expected Alzheimer's disease (AD), 29 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and 7 with a expected dementia with Levy bodies (DLB). The severity of cognitive disorders was determined according to the following scales: Global Deterioration Rating Scale, Mini-mental State Examination, Mattis Dementia Rating Scale. Besides, the patients state was evaluated, in the whole, according to some scales. Permeability of hemato-encephalic barrier was evaluated according to the blood serum levels of 3 neurospecific proteins--neuron specific enolase, glial fibrillary protein and alpha-glycoprotein. Their determination was performed by ELISA method. The significant elevation of the levels of the proteins studied was found already on the early stages of the disease. Their levels were higher in the patients with the dementia as compared with the individuals without it. There were no differences in cortical, subcortical and combined types of dementia. The authors believe, that some of the proteins studied (neuron specific enolase, for example) may serve as non specific markers of cerebral degeneration.
