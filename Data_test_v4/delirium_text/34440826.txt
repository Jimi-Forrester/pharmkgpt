34440826|a|Sanqi, a traditional Chinese herb, is widely used for cardiovascular diseases, and its neuroprotective effects against oxidative stress were recently discovered. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether Sanqi-derived compound K (Sanqi-CK), an active metabolite of Sanqi, could protect melanocytes from oxidative stress. Cultured human primary skin epidermal melanocytes (HEMn-MPs) were treated with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in the presence or absence of Sanqi-CK. Sanqi-CK exhibited protective effects against H2O2-induced cell death by reducing oxidative stress. In addition, treatment with Sanqi-CK reversed the decreased glutathione reductase activity and decreased ratio of reduced glutathione (GSH)/oxidized glutathione (GSSG) seen in H2O2-treated melanocytes. Furthermore, topical application of Sanqi-CK alleviated leukoderma in guinea pigs, a disorder characterized by melanocyte cell death resulting from rhododendrol-induced oxidative stress. Taken together, these data suggest that Sanqi-CK protects melanocytes against oxidative stress, and its protective effects are associated with modulating the redox balance between GSH and GSSG and activating glutathione reductase. Thus, Sanqi-CK may be a good candidate for preventing melanocyte loss in oxidative-stress-associated pigmentary disorders.
