31985374|t|A Recent Look into Natural Products that have Potential to Inhibit Cholinesterases and Monoamine Oxidase B: Update for 2010-2019.
31985374|a|With respect to the unknowns of pathophysiology of Alzheimer's Disease (AD)-, and Parkinson's Disease (PD)-like neurodegenerative disorders, natural product research is still one of the valid tools in order to provide alternative and/or better treatment options. At one hand, various extracts of herbals provide a combination of actions targeting multiple receptors, on the other hand, the discovery of active natural products (i.e., secondary metabolites) generally offers alternative chemical structures either ready to be employed in clinical studies or available to be utilized as important scaffolds for the design of novel agents. Regarding the importance of certain enzymes (e.g. cholinesterase and monoamine oxidase B), for the treatment of AD and PD, we have surveyed the natural product research within this area in the last decade. Particularly novel natural agents discovered within this period, concomitant to novel biological activities displayed for known natural products, are harmonized within the present study.
