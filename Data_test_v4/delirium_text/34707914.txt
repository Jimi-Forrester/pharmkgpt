34707914|a|INTRODUCTION: Mortality and morbidity are high for older adults after hip fracture (HF), but patients and surrogate decision makers (SDMs) are typically unaware of the poor prognosis. We developed a novel educational tool, My Hip Fracture (My-HF), to provide patients and SDMs of patients hospitalized with acute HF individualized estimates of their post-HF prognosis. We conducted initial usability testing of My-HF in a sample of patients with HF and SDMs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: My-HF provides information about: 1) anatomy and risk factors for HF; 2) Hip fracture treatment received; 3) individualized predicted risk of adverse events and 4) anticipated discharge trajectory. We conducted a qualitative usability study using a convenience sample of hospitalized, post-operative patients with acute HF or SDMs of patients who lacked decision-making capacity. We used semi-structured interviews to obtain feedback. Thematic analysis was used to identify themes and concepts. RESULTS: We conducted interviews with 8 patients and 9 SDMs (mean age of interviewees 70.1 years, 41% female). My-HF was generally well received. Thematic analysis identified legibility and visual appeal, comprehension, numeracy, utility and reflection as prominent themes. Most respondents found My-HF to be useful in improving their understanding of HF and as a potential mechanism for sharing information with other care team members (including family and professionals). Suggestions for improvement of legibility, presentation of the individualized prognosis information and content were identified. DISCUSSION: Patients and SDMs are generally accepting of My-HF and found it useful for communicating individualized prognostic information. Feedback identified areas for improvement for future iterations of the tool. CONCLUSION: My-HF presents a means of addressing the gap in understanding of prognosis post-HF as a part of patient-centered care. Further evaluation will be needed to assess the impact of My-HF on patient and SDM reported outcomes as we transition from a paper to smart-phone enabled web application.
