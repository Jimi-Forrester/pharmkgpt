12500258|t|Genetic abnormalities of the endothelium.
12500258|a|Endothelial cell dysfunction plays an important role in the development and progression of cardiovascular and other disease. The purpose of this review is to discuss some of the genetic diseases known to adversely affect endothelial function. Although the list is exhaustive, we focus our discussion on primary pulmonary hypertension, diabetes mellitus, Alzheimer's disease, Crohn's disease, Von-Hippel-Lindau disease, familial Mediterranean fever, thrombotic microangiopathy, and key vascular malformations. Endothelial dysfunction results from a complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors. This review highlights some of the growing body of evidence implicating endothelial dysfunction as an important mediator of diverse diseases.
