37840468|a|Exposure to mercury(II) ions (Hg2+) can cause various diseases such as Minamata disease, acrodynia, Alzheimer's disease, and Hunter-Russell syndrome, and even organ damage. Therefore, real-time and accurate monitoring of Hg2+ in environmental samples is crucial. In this study, we report a photoluminescent (PL) and electrochemiluminescent (ECL) probe based on a cyclometalated Ir(III) complex for the selective detection of Hg2+. The introduction of a reaction site, o-aminomethylphenylboronic acid, on the ancillary ligands allowed a prompt transmetalation reaction to take place between Hg2+ and boronic acid. This reaction resulted in significant decreases of the PL and ECL signals due to the photo-induced electron transfer from the Ir(III) complex to the Hg2+ ions. The probe was applied to the selective detection of Hg2+, and the signal changes revealed a linear correlation with Hg2+ concentrations in the range of 0-10 muM (LOD = 0.72 muM for PL, 8.03 nM for ECL). The designed probe allowed the successful quantification of Hg2+ in tap water samples, which proves its potential for the selective detection of Hg2+ in environmental samples.
