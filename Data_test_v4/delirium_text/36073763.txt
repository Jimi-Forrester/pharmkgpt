36073763|t|U1 snRNP proteins promote proximal alternative polyadenylation sites by directly interacting with 3' end processing core factors.
36073763|a|In eukaryotic cells, both alternative splicing and alternative polyadenylation (APA) play essential roles in the gene regulation network. U1 small ribonucleoprotein particle (U1 snRNP) is a major component of spliceosome, and U1 snRNP complex can suppress proximal APA sites through crosstalking with 3' end processing factors. However, here we show that both knockdown and overexpression of SNRPA, SNRPC, SNRNP70, and SNRPD2, the U1 snRNP proteins, promote the usage of proximal APA sites at the transcriptome level. SNRNP70 can drive the phase transition of PABPN1 from droplet to aggregate, which may reduce the repressive effects of PABPN1 on the proximal APA sites. Additionally, SNRNP70 can also promote the proximal APA sites by recruiting CPSF6, suggesting that the function of CPSF6 on APA is related with other RNA-binding proteins and cell context-dependent. Consequently, these results reveal that, on the contrary to U1 snRNP complex, the free proteins of U1 snRNP complex can promote proximal APA sites through the interaction with 3' end processing machinery.
