34434300|t|Hypothermia Following Spinal Anesthesia in an Infant: Potential Impact of Intravenous Dexmedetomidine and Intrathecal Clonidine.
34434300|a|The alpha2-adrenergic agonists (dexmedetomidine and clonidine) have been used in several different clinical scenarios in infants and children including sedation during mechanical ventilation, procedural sedation, supplementation of postoperative analgesia, prevention of emergence delirium, control of post-anesthesia shivering, treatment of withdrawal and prolonging of duration of neuraxial anesthesia. Hemodynamic effects including bradycardia and hypotension remain the predominant adverse effects reported with the alpha2-adrenergic agonists. We report hypothermia following intravenous sedation with dexmedetomidine and spinal anesthesia with a combination of bupivacaine and clonidine in a 2-month-old infant. The potential mechanisms involved are reviewed, the causal relationship between hypothermia and alpha2-adrenergic agonists is explored and interventions to avoid its development are presented.
