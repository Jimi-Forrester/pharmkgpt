3300132|a|Peroxidase-antiperoxidase staining of formalin-fixed brain was employed to compare the blood-brain barrier (BBB) function in five patients with Alzheimer's disease/senile dementia of the Alzheimer type (AD/SDAT) and three patients with AD/SDAT combined with multi-infarct dementia (MID/SDAT) with that of six non-demented aged controls. The diffusion of serum proteins through the BBB was visualized with antisera to albumin, prealbumin, immunoglobulin, C1q, C3c and to fibrinogen. A similar patterns of diffusion was seen in AD/SDAT and non-demented aged individuals. Neuron and glial cells were stained with different antisera in the vicinity of the diffusion. Senile (neuritic) plaques were occasionally visualized with antisera to IgG, C1q and C3c but not with antisera to albumin, prealbumin and fibrinogen in both demented and non-demented aged individuals. Neurofibrillary tangles were not labelled with any of the antisera studied. These results indicate that the BBB is compromised equally in AD/SDAT and in the non-demented elderly.
