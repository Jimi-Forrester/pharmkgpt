31998114|t|Positive Allosteric Modulation of Alpha7 Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptors Transiently Improves Memory but Aggravates Inflammation in LPS-Treated Mice.
31998114|a|Neuroinflammation accompanies or even precedes the development of cognitive changes in many brain pathologies, including Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, dampening inflammatory reactions within the brain is a promising strategy for supporting cognitive functions in elderly people and for preventing the development of neurodegenerative disorders. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors containing alpha7 subunits (alpha7 nAChRs) are involved in regulating cell survival, inflammation, and memory. The aim of our study was to evaluate the efficiency of alpha7-specific therapy at different stages of inflammation and to compare the effects of orthosteric agonist PNU282987 and type 2 positive allosteric modulator (PAM) PNU120596 in mice after a single injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The data presented demonstrate that PNU282987 protected mice from LPS-induced impairment of episodic memory by decreasing IL-6 levels in the blood, stabilizing the brain mitochondria and up-regulating the brain alpha7-, alpha3-, and alpha4-containing nAChRs. Such treatment was efficient when given simultaneously with LPS or a week after LPS injection and was not efficient if LPS had been injected 2 months before. PNU120596 also decreased IL-6, stabilized mitochondria and up-regulated the brain nAChRs. However, its memory-improving effect was transient and disappeared after the end of the injection cycle. Moreover, cessation of PNU120596 treatment resulted in a sharp increase in IL-1beta and IL-6 levels in the blood. It is concluded that activating alpha7 nAChRs protects the mouse brain from the pathogenic effect of LPS in the early stages of inflammation but is not efficient when irreversible changes have already occurred. The use of a PAM does not improve the effect of the agonist, possibly potentiates the effect of endogenous agonists, and results in undesirable effects after treatment cessation.
