38191490|a|Understanding metabolic heterogeneity is the key to uncovering the underlying mechanisms of metabolic-related diseases. Current metabolic imaging studies suffer from limitations including low resolution and specificity, and the model systems utilized often lack human relevance. Here, we present a single-cell metabolic imaging platform to enable direct imaging of lipid metabolism with high specificity in various human-derived 2D and 3D culture systems. Through the incorporation of an azide-tagged infrared probe, selective detection of newly synthesized lipids in cells and tissue became possible, while simultaneous fluorescence imaging enabled cell-type identification in complex tissues. In proof-of-concept experiments, newly synthesized lipids were directly visualized in human-relevant model systems among different cell types, mutation status, differentiation stages, and over time. We identified upregulated lipid metabolism in progranulin-knockdown human induced pluripotent stem cells and in their differentiated microglia cells. Furthermore, we observed that neurons in brain organoids exhibited a significantly lower lipid metabolism compared to astrocytes.
