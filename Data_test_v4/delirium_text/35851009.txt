35851009|a|PURPOSE: The Liyang cohort study on chronic diseases and risk factors monitoring in China (Liyang Study) is a prospective population-based study which aims to investigate and identify the determinants of the most prevalent chronic non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and to evaluate the impact of demographic characteristics, lifestyle, dietary habits, cognition, disability and NCDs on the health-related quality of life. PARTICIPANTS: Between March 2019 and June 2020, 10 056 individuals aged >=18 years were administered a baseline survey through a multistage cluster random sampling in Liyang City, southern Jiangsu Province, China. FINDINGS TO DATE: The Liyang Study included detailed sociodemographic, anthropometric and health-related behaviour, common NCDs and blood sample information. Moreover, the study gathered a series of data on specific scales including the activities of daily living, instrumental activities of daily living, abbreviated mental test, Food Frequency Questionnaire and EuroQol 5-Dimensions 5-Levels Scale. Of the 10 056 participants, 52.92% (n=5322) were female and 92.26% (n=9278) came from rural areas. The mean age was 49.9+-16.2 years. Men were more likely to have a higher level of education, annual income and a paid job than women (p<0.05). The top three overall most prevalent NCDs in the study were hypertension (18.06%, n=1815), digestive diseases (7.88%, n=791), and arthritis or rheumatism (5.28%, n=530). Women had a significantly higher prevalence of diabetes (5.46%, n=290 vs 4.42%, n=209, p=0.016) and arthritis (6.04%, n=321 vs 4.42%, n=209, p<0.001) than men, while the opposite was true for chronic lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (1.37%, n=65 vs 0.92%, n=49, p=0.032) and chronic hepatic diseases (0.80%, n=38 vs 0.47%, n=25, p=0.035). FUTURE PLANS: The current study will give valuable insights into the association between sociodemographic factors, health-related behaviour, diet, cognition, disability and genetic factors and the most prevalent NCDs among local community residents. Starting from 2022, a follow-up survey will be conducted every 3 years to further explore the causal relationship between the above factors and NCDs.
