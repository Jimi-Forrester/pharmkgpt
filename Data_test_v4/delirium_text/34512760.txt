34512760|t|Novel Trends in Electrochemical Biosensors for Early Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease.
34512760|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifactorial progressive and irreversible neurodegenerative disorder affecting mainly the population over 65 years of age. It is becoming a global health and socioeconomic problem, and the current number of patients reaching 30-50 million people will be three times higher over the next thirty years. OBJECTIVE: Late diagnosis caused by decades of the asymptomatic phase and invasive and cost-demanding diagnosis are problems that make the whole situation worse. Electrochemical biosensors could be the right tool for less invasive and inexpensive early diagnosis helping to reduce spend sources- both money and time. METHOD: This review is a survey of the latest advances in the design of electrochemical biosensors for the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. Biosensors are divided according to target biomarkers. CONCLUSION: Standard laboratory methodology could be improved by analyzing a combination of currently estimated markers along with neurotransmitters and genetic markers from blood samples, which make the test for AD diagnosis available to the wide public.
