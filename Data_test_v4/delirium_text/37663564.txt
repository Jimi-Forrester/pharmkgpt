37663564|t|Marchiafava-Bignami disease: Case presentation and radiological imaging.
37663564|a|Marchiafava-Bignami disease (MBD) is a rare vitamin B deficiency classically associated with alcoholism. MBD damages the corpus callosum and presents with nonspecific neurological symptoms. Radiological imaging is critical for diagnosing MBD and commencing subsequent treatment, which often consists of vitamin B supplementation. We present a case of MBD in a 56-year-old male with alcohol use disorder, epilepsy, schizophrenia, post-traumatic stress disorder, and cardiovascular risk factors. The patient presented with general neurological symptoms, and there were several potential diagnoses to consider based on the patient's history. Radiological imaging was necessary for diagnosis. This case demonstrates the role radiological imaging plays in the workup of MBD.
