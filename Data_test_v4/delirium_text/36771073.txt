36771073|t|Heteroaromatic Diazirines Are Essential Building Blocks for Material and Medicinal Chemistry.
36771073|a|In materials (polymer) science and medicinal chemistry, heteroaromatic derivatives play the role of the central skeleton in development of novel devices and discovery of new drugs. On the other hand, (3-trifluoromethyl)phenyldiazirine (TPD) is a crucial chemical method for understanding biological processes such as ligand-receptor, nucleic acid-protein, lipid-protein, and protein-protein interactions. In particular, use of TPD has increased in recent materials science to create novel electric and polymer devices with comparative ease and reduced costs. Therefore, a combination of heteroaromatics and (3-trifluoromethyl)diazirine is a promising option for creating better materials and elucidating the unknown mechanisms of action of bioactive heteroaromatic compounds. In this review, a comprehensive synthesis of (3-trifluoromethyl)diazirine-substituted heteroaromatics is described.
