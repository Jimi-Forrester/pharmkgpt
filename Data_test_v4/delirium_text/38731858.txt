38731858|t|Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy as the Course of Alzheimer's Disease.
38731858|a|This editorial investigates chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) as a course of Alzheimer's disease (AD). CTE is a debilitating neurodegenerative disease that is the result of repeated mild traumatic brain injury (TBI). Many epidemiological studies show that experiencing a TBI in early or middle life is associated with an increased risk of dementia later in life. Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) present a series of similar neuropathological features that were investigated in this work like recombinant tau into filaments or the accumulation and aggregation of Abeta protein. However, these two conditions differ from each other in brain-blood barrier damage. The purpose of this review was to evaluate information about CTE and AD from various articles, focusing especially on new therapeutic possibilities for the improvement in cognitive skills.
