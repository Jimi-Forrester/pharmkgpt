31501173|t|Delirium superimposed on dementia precipitated by an unexpected bladder tumour.
31501173|a|A patient in her 70s presented with confusion, agitation and psychotic symptoms. No cause was found until the incidental discovery of urothelial carcinoma. Upon removal of the tumour, the psychiatric symptoms largely improved leaving residual symptoms indicative of dementia. The patient had not been diagnosed with dementia previously and this made for an interesting disease presentation and progression. We discuss the challenges of diagnosing delirium and dementia in complex patients such as these and the importance of identifying a cause when cognition has been impaired by a suspected delirium.
