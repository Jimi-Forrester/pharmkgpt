31840044|t|Report from a multidisciplinary meeting on anxiety as a non-motor manifestation of Parkinson's disease.
31840044|a|Anxiety is a severe problem for at least one-third of people living with Parkinson's disease (PD). Anxiety appears to have a greater adverse impact on quality of life than motor impairment. Despite its high prevalence and impact on daily life, anxiety is often undiagnosed and untreated. To better address anxiety in PD, future research must improve knowledge about the mechanism of anxiety in PD and address the lack of empirical evidence from clinical trials. In response to these challenges, the Parkinson's Foundation sponsored an expert meeting on anxiety on June 13th and 14th 2018. This paper summarizes the findings from that meeting informed by a review of the existing literature and discussions among patients, caregivers, and an international, clinician-scientist, expert panel working group. The goal is to provide recommendations to improve our understanding and treatment of anxiety in PD.
