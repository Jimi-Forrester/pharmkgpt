34976021|t|Identification of a Risk Locus at 7p22.3 for Schizophrenia and Bipolar Disorder in East Asian Populations.
34976021|a|Background: Shared psychopathological features and mechanisms have been observed between schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BD), but their common risk genes and full genetic architectures remain to be fully characterized. The genome-wide association study (GWAS) datasets offer the opportunity to explore this scientific question using combined genetic data from enormous samples, ultimately allowing a better understanding of the onset and development of these illnesses. Methods: We have herein performed a genome-wide meta-analysis in two GWAS datasets of SZ and BD respectively (24,600 cases and 40,012 controls in total, discovery sample), followed by replication analyses in an independent sample of 4,918 SZ cases and 5,506 controls of Han Chinese origin (replication sample). The risk SNPs were then explored for their correlations with mRNA expression of nearby genes in multiple expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) datasets. Results: The single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs1637749 and rs3800908 at 7p22.3 region were significant in both discovery and replication samples, and exhibited genome-wide significant associations when combining all East Asian SZ and BD samples (29,518 cases and 45,518 controls). The risk SNPs were also significant in GWAS of SZ and BD among Europeans. Both risk SNPs significantly predicted lower expression of MRM2 in the whole blood and brain samples in multiple datasets, which was consistent with its reduced mRNA level in the brains of SZ patients compared with normal controls. The risk SNPs were also associated with MAD1L1 expression in the whole blood sample. Discussion: We have identified a novel genome-wide risk locus associated with SZ and BD in East Asians, adding further support for the putative common genetic risk of the two illnesses. Our study also highlights the necessity and importance of mining public datasets to explore risk genes for complex psychiatric diseases.
