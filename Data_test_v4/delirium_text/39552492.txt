39552492|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects millions of people and has limited treatment options, thus making it a global health concern. Amyloid beta (Abeta), a disrupted cholinergic system with high acetylcholinesterase (AChE), oxidative stress (OS), reduced antioxidants, and neuroinflammation are key factors influencing AD progression. Prior research has shown that AChE can interact with Abeta and increase its accumulation and neurotoxicity, so targeting AChEs and Abeta could be a potential therapeutic approach for AD treatment. It has been known that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can inhibit Abeta accumulation. Previously, TKM01, a derivative of 4-anilinoquinazoline, has demonstrated inhibitory effects against GSK-3beta-a regulator in AD progression. The current research included molecular docking studies of NSAIDs and TKM01 with Abeta and AChEs as targets. TKM01 exhibited a higher binding affinity with Abeta among all tested compounds. Molecular dynamic (MD) simulations confirmed the stability of the protein-TKM01 complexes. TKM01 also exhibited favorable drug-likeness properties, and no hepatoxicity was visualized in comparison with other compounds. Further, in vitro assay showed an inhibitory action of TKM01 (50-1200 microg/mL) on AChEs. In the in vivo studies on zebrafish larvae brains, we found that TKM01 (120 and 240 microg/mL) reduced the levels of AChEs and lipid peroxidation (LPO) and increased antioxidant superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) in AlCl3(80 microM)-induced AD-like model. Additionally, TKM01 treatment was found to decrease pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6. The current study demonstrates that TKM01 can be used to treat AD. Nonetheless, experimental validation is needed to reveal the cellular, sub-cellular, and molecular mechanisms and possible implications at a clinical stage.
