39497298|t|The emerging role of the cerebellum in neurodegeneration linked to cognitive impairment.
39497298|a|The cerebellum has been largely overlooked in Alzheimer's disease, despite increasing evidence implicating its cognitive capacities and functional networks, which interacts with cerebral cortex to subserve cognition. A study by Lin et al. has indicated that the cerebellum is part of the integrated network in amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), a prodromal state of Alzheimer's disease. The aMCI patients exhibited weaker cerebello-parietal functional connectivity but stronger cerebellar coupling with precuneus cortex, posterior cingulate gyrus, and caudate nucleus. These alterations in cerebello-cortical connectivity correlated with cognitive performance, suggesting a dynamic change of cerebello-cortical network related to cognitive change in aMCI.
