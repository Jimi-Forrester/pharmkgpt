32854853|t|Ketotherapeutics for neurodegenerative diseases.
32854853|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are, respectively, the most prevalent and fastest growing neurodegenerative diseases worldwide. The former is primarily characterized by memory loss and the latter by the motor symptoms of tremor and bradykinesia. Both AD and PD are progressive diseases that share several key underlying mitochondrial, inflammatory, and other metabolic pathologies. This review will detail how these pathologies intersect with ketone body metabolism and signaling, and how ketone bodies, particularly d-beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaHB), may serve as a potential adjunctive nutritional therapy for two of the world's most devastating conditions.
