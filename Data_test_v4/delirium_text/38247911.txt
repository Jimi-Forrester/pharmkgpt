38247911|t|ResnetAge: A Resnet-Based DNA Methylation Age Prediction Method.
38247911|a|Aging is a significant contributing factor to degenerative diseases such as cancer. The extent of DNA methylation in human cells indicates the aging process and screening for age-related methylation sites can be used to construct epigenetic clocks. Thereby, it can be a new aging-detecting marker for clinical diagnosis and treatments. Predicting the biological age of human individuals is conducive to the study of physical aging problems. Although many researchers have developed epigenetic clock prediction methods based on traditional machine learning and even deep learning, higher prediction accuracy is still required to match the clinical applications. Here, we proposed an epigenetic clock prediction method based on a Resnet neuro networks model named ResnetAge. The model accepts 22,278 CpG sites as a sample input, supporting both the Illumina 27K and 450K identification frameworks. It was trained using 32 public datasets containing multiple tissues such as whole blood, saliva, and mouth. The Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of the training set is 1.29 years, and the Median Absolute Deviation (MAD) is 0.98 years. The Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of the validation set is 3.24 years, and the Median Absolute Deviation (MAD) is 2.3 years. Our method has higher accuracy in age prediction in comparison with other methylation-based age prediction methods.
