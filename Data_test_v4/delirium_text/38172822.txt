38172822|a|BACKGROUND: The nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor (NLR) family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome has been reported to be highly expressed in oral lesions with the potential for malignant development such as oral lichen planus (OLP). And the NLRP3 inflammasome can be activated by galectin-3 (Gal-3) in immune-mediated chronic inflammatory diseases. This study aimed to explore the inter-relationships among Gal-3, NLRP3 inflammasome, and OLP. METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis of oral biopsy specimens from 30 patients with Erosive OLP and 30 healthy controls was performed. Immunohistochemical staining was used to evaluate the expression of Gal-3 and NLRP3 inflammasome. Two-sample t-test and Pearson correlation test were applied to analyze the data. RESULTS: Erosive OLP patients had significantly higher Gal-3 levels compared with controls (p < 0.0001). A similar pattern emerged for NLRP3 inflammasome. In the overall sample, a positive correlation was observed between Gal-3 and NLRP3 (r = 0.92, p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with Erosive OLP lesions showed increased protein expression levels of Gal-3. A positive correlation was observed between Gal-3 and NLRP3 inflammasome.
