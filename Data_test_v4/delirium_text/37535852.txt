37535852|t|The Role of Protein-L-isoaspartyl Methyltransferase (PIMT) in the Suppression of Toxicity of the Oligomeric Form of Abeta42, in Addition to the Inhibition of Its Fibrillization.
37535852|a|The oligomeric form of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta42) plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and is responsible for cognitive deficits. The soluble oligomers are believed to be more toxic compared to the fibril form. Protein-L-isoaspartyl methyltransferase (PIMT) is a repair enzyme that converts aberrant isoAsp residues, formed spontaneously on isomerization of normal Asp and Asn residues, back to typical Asp. It was shown to inhibit the fibrillization of Abeta42 (containing three Asp residues), and here, we investigate its effect on the size, conformation, and toxicity of Abeta42 oligomers (AbetaO). Far-UV CD indicated a shift in the conformational feature of AbetaOs from the random coil to beta-sheet in the presence of PIMT. Binding of bis-ANS to different AbetaOs (obtained using different concentrations of Abeta42 monomer) indicated the correlation of size of oligomers to hydrophobicity: the smallest AbetaO having the highest hydrophobicity is the most toxic. Dynamic light scattering showed an increase in size of AbetaO with the addition of PIMT, a contrasting role to that on Abeta fibril. Assays using PC12-derived neurons showed the neuroprotective role of PIMT against AbetaO-induced toxicity. Furthermore, we have elaborated on the molecular mechanism of the antifibrillar action of PIMT and how this function is correlated with its enzymatic activity. PIMT has a more pronounced effect on AbetaO as compared to a small heat shock protein, pointing to its importance for the amelioration of the adverse effect of both Abeta42 oligomers and fibrils.
