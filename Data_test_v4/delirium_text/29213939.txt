29213939|a|Dementia is a major cause of dependency and disability among older persons, and imposes huge economic burdens. Only a few cost-of-illness studies for dementia have been carried out in middle and low-income countries. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to analyze costs of dementia in demented patients of a private clinic in Lima, Peru. METHODS: We performed a retrospective, cohort, 3-month study by extracting information from medical records of demented patients to assess the use of both healthcare and non-healthcare resources. The total costs of the disease were broken down into direct (medical and social care costs) and indirect costs (informal care costs). RESULTS: In 136 outpatients, we observed that while half of non-demented patients had total care costs of less than US$ 23 over three months, demented patients had costs of US$ 1500 or over (and more than US$ 1860 for frontotemporal dementia). In our study, the monthly cost of a demented patient (US$ 570) was 2.5 times higher than the minimum wage (legal minimum monthly wage in Peru for 2011: US$ 222.22). CONCLUSION: Dementia constitutes a socioeconomic problem even in developing countries, since patients involve high healthcare and non-healthcare costs, with the costs being especially high for the patient's family.
