8587175|a|The etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) still remains unknown in spite of intensive research efforts. Recent genetic linkage studies have been reported regarding some candidate genes for familial Alzheimer's disease, such as amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene and apolipoprotein E gene. On the other hand, several risk factors of AD have been revealed by epidemiological studies, including age, family history, head trauma, thyroid dysfunctions and aluminum (Al). Our study of bulk sample analysis in AD brain using neutron activation analysis showed a significant increase of Al and iron (Fe) concentrations, especially in the cerebral cortices compared with age-matched controls. Based on these results, the possible role of trace elements on the etiopathogenesis of AD is discussed.
