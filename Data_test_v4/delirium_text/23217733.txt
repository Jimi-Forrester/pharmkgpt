23217733|t|Stealth attack: plaque-specific antibody allows for efficient Abeta removal without side effects.
23217733|a|Anti-Abeta antibodies are being developed as potential treatments for Alzheimer's disease. Some have dose-limiting side effects and many do not robustly remove pre-existing amyloid plaques. In this issue of Neuron, DeMattos et al. (2012) demonstrate that an amyloid plaque-specific antibody removes existing Abeta aggregates without side effects.
