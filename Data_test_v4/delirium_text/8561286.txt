8561286|t|Assessing gender interactions in the prediction of mortality in alcoholic men and women: a 20-year follow-up study.
8561286|a|This study investigates the predictors of mortality in 259 male and female alcoholics who were psychiatrically hospitalized between 1967 and 1968 and followed for > 20 years. The findings showed that, in addition to age, marital status, medical complications, and non-antisocial personality comorbidity were important independent predictors of time to death. Data pointed to gender interactions, in that marital disruption tended to be a stronger predictor of mortality in men, and delirium tremens tended to be a stronger predictor of mortality in women. Knowing and understanding that certain events and processes may differentially affect the survival of male and female alcoholics will allow for the development of more individualized and gender-specific therapeutic interventions.
