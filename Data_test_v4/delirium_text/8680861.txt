8680861|a|The influence of dexamethasone on monoamine oxidase (MAO) A and B expression and activity was investigated in primary cultures of rat type 1 astrocytes cultured under serum free, defined conditions. Dexamethasone treatment resulted in a dose- and time-dependent induction of MAO-B, but not of MAO-A, activity. The selective MAO-B increase was substantially reduced by the antagonist RU 486, thus suggesting a glucocorticoid receptor-mediated action of the hormone. Kinetic analysis showed an increase in Vmax of MAO-B with no change in apparent K(m). The dexamethasone-induced selective rise in MAO-B activity appeared to be due to enhanced enzyme synthesis, since MAO-B mRNA was markedly increased by dexamethasone treatment and the recovery of MAO-B activity after its irreversible inhibition by deprenyl was more pronounced in the presence than in the absence of the hormone. Furthermore, the dexamethasone effect was abolished by the protein synthesis inhibitors actinomycin D or cycloheximide. The present study demonstrates that dexamethasone is able to selectively induce MAO-B in type 1 astrocytes and leads to speculation of a possible role for glucocorticoids in the increase in brain MAO-B associated with neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases.
