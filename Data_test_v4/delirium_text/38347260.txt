38347260|a|This study aims to investigate the potential correlation between the use of olanzapine, a psychopharmacological intervention commonly prescribed in Anorexia Nervosa treatment, and the occurrence of Refeeding Syndrome. Despite the acknowledged nutritional and biochemical impacts of olanzapine, the literature lacks information regarding its specific association with Refeeding Syndrome onset in individuals with Anorexia Nervosa. This is a naturalistic, retrospective, observational study, reporting the occurrence of Refeeding Syndrome in children and adolescents with Anorexia Nervosa, treated or untreated with olanzapine. Dosages and serum levels of olanzapine were assessed for potential associations with the occurrence of Refeeding Syndrome and specific variations in Refeeding Syndrome-related electrolytes. Overall, 113 patients were enrolled, including 46 (41%) who developed a Refeeding Syndrome. Mild (87%), moderate (6.5%), and severe (6.5%) Refeeding Syndrome was described, at a current average intake of 1378 +- 289 kcal/day (39 +- 7.7 kcal/kg/die), frequently associated with nasogastric tube (39%) or parenteral (2.2%) nutrition. Individuals receiving olanzapine experienced a more positive phosphorus balance than those who did not (F(1,110) = 4.835, p = 0.030), but no difference in the occurrence of Refeeding Syndrome was documented. The mean prescribed doses and serum concentrations of olanzapine were comparable between Refeeding Syndrome and no-Refeeding Syndrome patients.    Conclusion: The present paper describes the occurrence of Refeeding Syndrome and its association with olanzapine prescriptions in children and adolescents with Anorexia Nervosa. Olanzapine was associated with a more positive phosphorus balance, but not with a different occurrence of Refeeding Syndrome. Further, longitudinal studies are required. What is Known:   Refeeding Syndrome (RS) is a critical complication during refeeding in malnourished patients, marked by electrolyte (phosphorus, magnesium, potassium) imbalances.   Olanzapine, an atypical antipsychotic with nutritional and biochemical impacts, is used in Anorexia Nervosa (AN) treatment, however data concerning its association with RS are lacking. What is New:   The study observed RS in 46/113 (41%) young patients with AN.   Olanzapine-treated individuals showed a higher improvement in serum phosphate levels than untreated ones, although no impact on the occurrence of Refeeding Syndrome was observed.
