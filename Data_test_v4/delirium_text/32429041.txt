32429041|t|COVID-19 and Gastrointestinal Symptoms-A Case Report.
32429041|a|COVID-19, a new illness secondary to a novel Coronavirus emerged in December 2019 in China. Our early understanding of the clinical features of COVID-19 has been based on case series emerging from the first outbreak in Wuhan. These features included fever, a dry cough, myalgia and dyspnea. Gastrointestinal symptoms were rarely reported as a key feature. We present a case report of a 74-year-old male who presented with symptoms of gastroenteritis and subsequently tested positive for COVID-19. This article aims to highlight an uncommon presentation of COVID-19 and that a high index of suspicion is required for COVID-19 in older people given their greater likelihood of presenting atypically.
