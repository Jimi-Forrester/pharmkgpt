38344343|t|Symmetrical peripheral gangrene following testicular torsion surgery: A case report.
38344343|a|Key Clinical Message: Symmetrical peripheral gangrene (SPG) is very rare condition associated with symmetrical ischemia and gangrene affecting two or more distal extremities. It is almost always associated with septicemia and has a high mortality rate. The rarity of this condition and lack of prospective trials makes its recognition and management difficult. Care providers should maintain a high index of suspicion for SPG in patients with sepsis who develop cyanosis and ischemia of extremities. Doing early culture and sensitivity studies is key in guiding apropriate antibiotic treatment. Abstract: Symmetrical peripheral gangrene (SPG) is very rare condition associated with symmetrical ischemia and gangrene affecting two or more distal extremities. It can occur at any age and may affect either sex. It is almost always associated with septicemia and has a high mortality rate (up to 35%). The rarity of this condition and lack of prospective trials makes its recognition and management difficulty. Only a few case reports have been in literature since its discovery in 1981. A 14 year old boy was referred to our tertiary facility due to postoperative wound sepsis. He had undergone right scrotal exploration and orchidectomy due to right testicular torsion. His initial symptoms were abrupt onset of scrotal pain and swelling which he developed while playing. Physical examination findings on admission were severe pallor of mucous membranes, fever and diaphoresis and mild respiratory distress. He also had a gangrenous perineal area involving the penis and cyanosed tips of fingers and toes bilaterally. He had a normal ankle branchial index of 0.9. His preliminary laboratory investigations revealed a marked neutrophilia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated D-Dimers. Initial resuscitative interventions included oxygen therapy, blood transfusion with whole blood and platelets, empirical antibiotics, analgesics, and surgical debridement of the perineal in theater. A diagnosis of severe sepsis complicated with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) was made. The cyanosis on extremities spread proximally during the patient's course of treatment to full blown gangrene. At the time when clinical and biochemical remission of the infection was attained, the gangrene had demarcated at below elbow in both upper limbs and below knees in both lower limbs. An arterial angiogram was done and revealed normal flow in all proximal and distal branches of the aorta with no occlusion. A multidisciplinary agreement to conduct quadrilateral amputations plus penile amputation was made between urologists, vascular and orthopedic surgeons. The exact pathogenesis of how SPG occurs is not well understood. The underlying mechanism includes a low flow state with DIC. Ischemic changes usually begin in the peripheries and extend proximally. Ischemic changes are not preceded by peripheral vascular occlusive disease. SPG should be suspected when a patient present with marked coldness, pain in the distal extremities, cyanosis, and pallor. Early recognition helps to arrest the progression of ischemic changes before overt gangrene occur and improves the qaulity of life.
