33731377|t|Delirium in the NICU: Risk or Reality?
33731377|a|Delirium is a frequent complication of critical illness in adult and pediatric populations and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Little is known about the incidence, risk, symptoms, or treatment of delirium in the NICU. Only 4 cases of NICU delirium have been reported, but many pediatric studies include infants. The Cornell Assessment of Pediatric Delirium tool has been validated in neonatal and infant populations for identification of delirium. Initial treatment should focus on identification and reversal of the cause, with pharmacologic management reserved for patients with symptoms that do not resolve or that significantly impact medical care. Routine use of intravenous haloperidol should be avoided because of the high incidence of serious adverse effects, but it may be considered in patients with significant symptoms who are unable to take oral medications. Atypical antipsychotics (olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone) appear to be efficacious with a low incidence of adverse effects. Risperidone has weight-based dosing and a liquid dosage form available, making it a good option for use in the NICU. Additional data from large cohorts of NICU patients routinely screened for delirium, and treated as indicated, are needed.
