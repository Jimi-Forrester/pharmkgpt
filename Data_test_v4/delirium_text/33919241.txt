33919241|t|Influence of Trace Elements on Neurodegenerative Diseases of The Eye-The Glaucoma Model.
33919241|a|Glaucoma is a heterogeneous group of chronic neurodegenerative disorders characterized by a relatively selective, progressive damage to the retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and their axons, which leads to axon loss and visual field alterations. To date, many studies have shown the role of various elements, mainly metals, in maintaining the balance of prooxidative and antioxidative processes, regulation of fluid and ion flow through cell membranes of the ocular tissues. Based on the earlier and current research results, their relationship with the development and progression of glaucoma seems obvious and is increasingly appreciated. In this review, we aimed to summarize the current evidence on the role of trace elements in the pathogenesis and prevention of glaucomatous diseases. Special attention is also paid to the genetic background associated with glaucoma-related abnormalities of physiological processes that regulate or involve the ions of elements considered as trace elements necessary for the functioning of the cells.
