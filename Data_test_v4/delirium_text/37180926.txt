37180926|t|Neuroprotective mechanisms of Asiatic acid.
37180926|a|Asiatic acid (AA) is the most crucial component of Asiaticoside in many edible and medicinal plants. It has diverse biological activities such as anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-infective, and anti-tumor. Additionally, AA has been intensively studied in the last decades. It has shown great potential in the treatment of various neurological diseases such as spinal cord injury (SCI), cerebral ischemia, epilepsy, traumatic brain injury (TBI), neural tumors, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Parkinson's disease (PD). Moreover, AA provides pertinent data for neuroprotective signaling pathways, and its substantial neuroprotective ability makes it a novel candidate for developing drugs that target the central nervous system.
