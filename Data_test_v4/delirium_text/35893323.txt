35893323|t|The Relationship between Metabolic Syndrome and Frailty in Older People: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
35893323|a|AIMS: Both metabolic syndrome (MetS) and frailty are associated with increased all-cause mortality, yet the complex interplay between these two conditions has not adequately been elucidated. We aim to analyse the relationship between MetS and frailty through a systematic review of the literature with meta-analyses. METHODS: A literature search was conducted via MEDLINE and EMBASE. Studies were included if validated frameworks for defining frailty and MetS (presence of at least 3 out of the five constitutive components: abdominal obesity, high fasting blood glucose, hypertension, hypertriglyceridaemia, and low high-density lipoprotein level) were utilised, in addition to the inclusion of participants aged 60 or older. RESULTS: Eleven studies were included, all observational. All were in community-dwelling older people, 9 cross-sectional and 2 longitudinal. Most of the studies used Fried's frailty phenotype. The prevalence of frailty ranged from 0.9% to 14.8% in population-based studies and 35.6% in the outpatient clinic setting. The prevalence of MetS was also higher in the outpatient clinic setting at 47.5%, compared to 17.5-41.0% in the community-dwelling populations. The meta-analysis of 11 studies showed that MetS was associated with an increased risk of frailty (pooled OR 1.73, 95% CI, 1.41-2.13). CONCLUSION: This systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that frailty was more prevalent in older people with MetS compared to older people without MetS. The study findings suggest the importance of frailty screening in older people with MetS and a distinct role of managing MetS in preventing frailty in older people.
