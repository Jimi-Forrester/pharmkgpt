38233831|t|Risk factors for postoperative delirium in orthopaedic hip surgery patients: a database review.
38233831|a|BACKGROUND: Postoperative delirium is a common problem affecting admitted patients that decreases patient satisfaction and increases the cost and complexity of care. The purpose of this study was to use the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) database to compare rates and risk factors of postoperative delirium for total hip arthroplasty (THA) and hemiarthroplasty patients indicated for osteoarthritis or proximal femur fracture. METHODS: The 2021 NSQIP database was queried for patients using Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes for THA and hemiarthroplasty and ICD-10 codes for osteoarthritis or proximal femur fracture. Demographic, past medical history, preoperative labs, and functional status data were recorded. Procedural data were also collected. Finally, postoperative outcomes and complications were reviewed. RESULTS: Overall, 16% of patients had postoperative delirium. Delirium patients were older on average (82.4 years vs. 80.7 years, p < 0.001), had a lower BMI (19.5 vs. 24.8, p < 0.001), were more likely to have a history of dementia (54.6% vs. 13.6%, p < 0.001), were less likely to have an independent functional status (p < 0.001) or live alone (p < 0.001), and were more likely to have sustained a recent fall (p < 0.001). Delirium patients were more likely to be hyponatremic or hypernatremic (p = 0.002), anemic (p < 0.001), and severely dehydrated (p < 0.001), among other lab abnormalities. Delirium patients were also more likely to experience additional postoperative complications, including pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, urinary tract infection, stroke, cardiac arrest, sepsis, and unplanned reoperation and readmission after discharge (all p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, factors associated with postoperative delirium in patients undergoing hemiarthroplasty and THA were identified, including older age, lower BMI, certain medical conditions, decreased functional status, certain lab abnormalities, and postoperative complications. These findings can be used by clinicians to better inform care and to determine when orthopaedic joint replacement patients may be at an increased risk for postoperative delirium.
