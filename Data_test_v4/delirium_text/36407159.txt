36407159|t|An Overview of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) Pathogenesis, Classification, and Management.
36407159|a|Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex autoimmune disease with multisystem involvement. It is multifactorial and involves epigenetic, genetic, ecological, and environmental factors. Primarily it leads to activation of both innate and adaptive immunity, which consequently leads to autoreactive B cell activation by T cells and leads to immune complexes deposition in tissues leading to an autoimmune cascade that may be limited to the single organ or can cause a widespread systemic involvement. SLE is heterogeneous in presentation, with a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations ranging from clinically mild self-resolving symptoms to severe life-threatening organ involvement. Clinical and serological heterogeneity are critical features in SLE, posing a significant challenge in its diagnosis. Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) are the telltale serological marker in more than 95% of SLE patients. The improved set of European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR) classification enabled accurate diagnosis of SLE. The treatment focuses on remission, preventing organ damage, and improving the overall quality of life.
