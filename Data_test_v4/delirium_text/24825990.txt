24825990|a|The objective of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of midazolam premedication in attenuating the psychic sequelae of ketamine dissociative anaesthesia. Sixty patients undergoing various short surgical and urological procedures were taken in the study. All patients were premedicated with midazolam (0.05mg/kg i.v) five minutes before ketamine induction (1mg/kg i.v). The excitatory phenomenon, emergence delirium, occurrence of unpleasant dreams and patient acceptability of ketamine anaesthesia were recorded. Out of 60 patients studied, 15% had excitatory effects, 8% had mild delirium and 3% patients had unpleasant dreams in post operative period. Patient acceptability of ketamine anaesthesia was 100%. Hence from the study it was concluded that, midazolam premedication is effective in attenuating ketamine psychic sequelae.
