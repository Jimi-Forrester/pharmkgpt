34355171|t|Predictors of survival in elderly patients undergoing surgery for glioblastoma.
34355171|a|BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma (GBM) has a median age of diagnosis of 64 years old and the incidence increases with age. An increasing number of elderly patients are being diagnosed with GBM and undergoing surgery. These patients often present with multiple medical comorbidities and have significantly worse outcomes compared to adult patients. The goal of this study was to determine clinical predictors of survival in elderly patients undergoing surgery for GBM. METHODS: Our brain tumor database was reviewed for all patients 65 years of age and older that underwent surgery for newly diagnosed GBM over a 14-year period from 2005 to 2018. Patient characteristics, comorbidities, complications, and treatment were collected. A total of 150 patients were included, and subdivided into two age categories; 65-74 years old and 75 years or older. RESULTS: The median OS for all patients was 9.4 months. Neither the presence nor number of medical comorbidities were associated with decreased survival (P = .9 and P = .1, respectively). Postoperative complications were associated with worse survival for all patients (HR = 2.34, P = .01) and occurred in patients in the older age category and patients with longer lengths of stay (P < .0001). CONCLUSIONS: The presence of medical comorbidities is not a reason to exclude patients with GBM from surgical consideration. Excluding EOR and adjuvant treatment, postoperative complication is the most significant predictor of survival in elderly patients. Postoperative complications are associated with a longer LOS and are more common in patients 75 years of age and older.
