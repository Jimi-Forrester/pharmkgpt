28852022|t|Multipoint Tissue Circulation Monitoring with a Flexible Optical Probe.
28852022|a|Compromised circulation is a potential complication during the postoperative period following tissue transplantation. The use of a monitoring device allows physicians to detect compromised circulation immediately. Such monitoring devices need to be continuously usable, wearable, and area-detectable. However, existing devices fail to satisfy all of these requirements simultaneously. We developed a wearable, multipoint pulse wave-monitoring device. An array of reflective optical sensors implemented on a thin film substrate was used as a lightweight and flexible probe. As a model of tissue transplantation, an inguinal flap in a Wistar rat was dissected and freed from all subcutaneous tissue. By ligating the artery or vein, ischemia or congestion was induced in the tissue. In a human study, ischemia or congestion was induced in the palm by pressing the feeding artery or cutaneous vein, respectively. The amplitude of the pulse wave was evaluated using the power spectrum of Fourier transformed signals. Pulse wave amplitude significantly decreased under compromised circulation in both animal and human models. Moreover, we accomplished 1 week of continuous wireless monitoring in healthy subjects. These results demonstrated the potential utility of the developed device in postoperative blood-flow monitoring to improve the rescue rate of transplanted tissue.
