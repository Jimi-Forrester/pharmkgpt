25179671|a|BACKGROUND: High-profile Phase 3 clinical trials of bapineuzumab and solanezumab, antibodies targeted at amyloid-beta (Abeta) removal, have failed to meet their primary endpoints. Neither drug improves clinical outcomes in patients with late onset AD, joining a long list of unsuccessful attempts to treat AD with anti-amyloid therapies. DISCUSSION: These therapies are based on the assumption that Abeta accumulation is the primary pathogenic trigger of AD. Current evidence suggests that Abeta may actually accumulate as part of an adaptive response to long-term chronic brain stress stimuli that would make more suitable candidates for therapeutic intervention. SUMMARY: At this juncture it is no longer unreasonable to suggest that further iterations of anti-Abeta therapies should be halted. Clinicians and researchers should instead direct their attention toward greater understanding of the biological function of Abeta both in healthy and demented brains, as well as the involvement of long-term chronic exposure to stress in the etiology of AD.
