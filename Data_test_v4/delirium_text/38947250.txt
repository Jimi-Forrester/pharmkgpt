38947250|t|Critical Assessment of the Neurological Complications during High-Risk Anesthesia Procedures.
38947250|a|Damage to the peripheral and central nervous systems is frequently irreversible. Surgically induced neurological damage and anesthesia may result in catastrophic situations for patients and their families. The incidence of significant neurological complications during the perioperative period is examined in this article. In contrast to other organs like the kidney, heart, liver, lungs, and skeletal system, native neurological function cannot be replaced with artificial parts or devices soon. Ignoring brain function during the perioperative period has been a systemic problem in anesthesiology, even though the central and peripheral nervous systems are crucial. This bold claim is intended to draw attention to the fact that, unlike the circulatory and respiratory systems, which have been routinely monitored for decades, the brain and other neural structures do not have a standard monitoring during surgery and anesthesia. Given that the brain and spinal cord are the principal therapeutic targets of analgesics and anesthetics, this deficiency in clinical care is even more alarming. Organs that are notoriously hard to repair or replace after damage have, up until now, received comparatively little attention. In this article, a succinct overview of five neurological complications associated with surgery and anesthesia is presented. After critically reviewing the literature on the subject, the article is focused to common (delirium), controversial (postoperative cognitive decline), and potentially catastrophic (stroke, spinal cord ischemia, or postoperative visual loss) adverse events in the neurological surgery setting. The findings will increase awareness of major neurological complications to the involved surgical and anesthesia team and enhance preventive and treatment strategies during the perioperative period.
