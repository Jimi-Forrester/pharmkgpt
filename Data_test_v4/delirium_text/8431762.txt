8431762|a|Proteoglycans (PGs) may play a fundamental role in all forms of amyloidosis. In Alzheimer's disease, proteoglycans are found deposited in senile plaques and in neurofibrillary tangles. However, the cellular source of these deposited PGs and their role in amyloidosis in Alzheimer's disease is unknown. Proteoglycans were purified from conditioned medium of human neuroblastoma cells (SKNSH-SY 5Y). Two species of proteoglycans were identified by enzyme susceptibility including a heparan sulfate proteoglycan and a dermatan sulfate proteoglycan. A monoclonal antibody to the protein core of a vascular basement membrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan found in senile plaques in Alzheimer's disease cross-reacted with the proteoglycans secreted by human neuroblastoma cells. Binding between 35SO4-labelled neuroblastoma proteoglycans and the Alzheimer amyloid (A4) peptide was demonstrated by affinity chromatography. Specificity studies demonstrated that binding of human neuroblastoma proteoglycans to the amyloid peptide was specific for a heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan, with some binding to a dermatan sulfate proteoglycan. Binding to A4 was also demonstrated by a chemically deglycosylated protein core preparation. No significant binding of neuroblastoma proteoglycans was found to two other basic peptides derived from the extracellular domain of the beta-amyloid precursor, demonstrating the specificity of proteoglycan binding to the A4 peptide. Human neuroblastoma proteoglycans may bind to the-Alzheimer amyloid A4 peptide in a region with a heparin binding consensus sequence [VHHQKL] which also contains the cleavage site of the beta-amyloid precursor protein. Neuronal proteoglycans may either regulate the secretion of the amyloid protein precursor or modify the binding of the amyloid protein precursor to other cellular adhesion molecules. Alterations in this binding may be related to the pathogenesis of amyloid deposition in Alzheimer's disease.
