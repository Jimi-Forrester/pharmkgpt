30874626|a|Inflammation of the nervous system (neuroinflammation) is now recognized as a hallmark of virtually all neurological disorders. In neuroinflammatory conditions such as multiple sclerosis, there is prominent infiltration and a long-lasting representation of various leukocyte subsets in the central nervous system (CNS) parenchyma. Even in classic neurodegenerative disorders, where such immense inflammatory infiltrates are absent, there is still evidence of activated CNS-intrinsic microglia. The consequences of excessive and uncontrolled neuroinflammation are injury and death to neural elements, which manifest as a heterogeneous set of neurological symptoms. However, it is now readily acknowledged, due to instructive studies from the peripheral nervous system and a large body of CNS literature, that aspects of the neuroinflammatory response can be beneficial for CNS outcomes. The recognized benefits of inflammation to the CNS include the preservation of CNS constituents (neuroprotection), the proliferation and maturation of various neural precursor populations, axonal regeneration, and the reformation of myelin on denuded axons. Herein, we highlight the benefits of neuroinflammation in fostering CNS recovery after neural injury using examples from multiple sclerosis, traumatic spinal cord injury, stroke, and Alzheimer's disease. We focus on CNS regenerative responses, such as neurogenesis, axonal regeneration, and remyelination, and discuss the mechanisms by which neuroinflammation is pro-regenerative for the CNS. Finally, we highlight treatment strategies that harness the benefits of neuroinflammation for CNS regenerative responses.
