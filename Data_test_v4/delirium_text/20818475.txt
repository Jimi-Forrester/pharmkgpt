While some countries provide high quality care for the disabled elderly, in others this is not the case. Education of a medical director has been shown to improve the quality of the nursing home. Physicians need to have knowledge of how to implement continuous quality improvement and culture change. Key medical issues include moving to a restraint free environment, subsyndromal delirium, behavioral disturbances, weight loss, pain management, pressure ulcers, falls, hip fractures, polypharmacy, depression and frailty.
