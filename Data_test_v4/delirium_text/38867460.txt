38867460|t|Use of lecanemab for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease: A systematic review.
38867460|a|PURPOSE: The US Food and Drug Administration authorized lecanemab for the therapeutic use of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in January 2023. To assess the effectiveness and safety of lecanemab in treating AD, we thoroughly examined the studies that are currently accessible. METHOD: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis recommendations were followed. In order to find relevant studies on lecanemab, we carried out a thorough literature search utilizing the electronic databases MEDLINE via PubMed, Cochrane, Web of Science, EBSCOhost, and Scopus. Excluding any research using experimental animals, we looked at lecanemab's effectiveness and side effects in treating AD in human clinical trials. Three randomized controlled studies were included. FINDINGS: According to studies, lecanemab lessens clinical deterioration and reduces brain amyloid-beta plaques (difference,.45; 95% confidence interval,.67 to.23; p < .001). Participants who received lecanemab saw a greater frequency of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA)-H (17.3% vs. 9.0%) and ARIA-E (12.6% vs. 1.7%), which is a significant adverse outcome. CONCLUSION: Lecanemab has been shown to have an impact on the two primary pathophysiologic indicators of AD (Abeta and tau). There are still a lot of unresolved issues related to lecanemab. Future research on the effectiveness and safety of lecanemab is advised in order to determine that the advantages of this medication exceed the disadvantages.
