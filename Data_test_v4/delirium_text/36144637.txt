36144637|a|Sweroside is a secoiridoid glycoside and belongs to a large group of naturally occurring monoterpenes with glucose sugar attached to C-1 in the pyran ring. Sweroside can promote different biological activities such as antifungal, antibacterial, hepatoprotective, gastroprotective, sedative and antitumor, antioxidant, and neuroprotective activities. Zebrafish were given sweroside (12.79, 8.35, and 13.95 nM) by immersion once daily for 8 days, along with scopolamine (Sco, 100 muM) 30 min before the initiation of the behavioral testing to cause anxiety and memory loss. Employing the novel tank diving test (NTT), the Y-maze, and the novel object recognition test (NOR), anxiety-like reactions and memory-related behaviors were assessed. The following seven groups (n = 10 animals per group) were used: control, Sco (100 muM), sweroside treatment (2.79, 8.35, and 13.95 nM), galantamine (GAL, 2.71 muM as the positive control in Y-maze and NOR tests), and imipramine (IMP, 63.11 muM as the positive control in NTT test). Acetylcholinesterase activity (AChE) and the antioxidant condition of the brains were also evaluated. The structure of sweroside isolated from Schenkia spicata was identified. Treatment with sweroside significantly improved the Sco-induced decrease of the cholinergic system activity and brain oxidative stress. These results suggest that sweroside exerts a significant effect on anxiety and cognitive impairment, driven in part by the modulation of the cholinergic system activity and brain antioxidant action.
