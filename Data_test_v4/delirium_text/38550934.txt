38550934|a|More than 50 million older people worldwide are suffering from dementia, and this number is estimated to increase to 150 million by 2050. Greater caregiver burdens and financial impacts on the healthcare system are expected as we wait for an effective treatment for dementia. Researchers are constantly exploring new therapies and screening approaches for the early detection of dementia. Artificial intelligence (AI) is widely applied in dementia research, including machine learning and deep learning methods for dementia diagnosis and progression detection. Computerized apps are also convenient tools for patients and caregivers to monitor cognitive function changes. Furthermore, social robots can potentially provide daily life support or guidance for the elderly who live alone. This review aims to provide an overview of AI applications in dementia research. We divided the applications into three categories according to different stages of cognitive impairment: (1) cognitive screening and training, (2) diagnosis and prognosis for dementia, and (3) dementia care and interventions. There are numerous studies on AI applications for dementia research. However, one challenge that remains is comparing the effectiveness of different AI methods in real clinical settings.
