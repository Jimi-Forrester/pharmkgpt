35568086|a|Previous studies have shown that adenosine has estrogen-like activity mediated by estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha). This study aimed to examine the effects of adenosine on Abeta25-35-induced brain injury and the underlying mechanisms involved. Adenosine (Ade, 20 mg/kg, i.g.) was administered for four weeks, followed by the induction of Alzheimer's disease (AD) by Abeta25-35 (200 microM, 3 microL/20 g, i.c.v.). Furthermore, a specific ERalpha blocker (MPP, 0.3 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered 30 min before the treatments of adenosine to evaluate whether the observed effects elicited by adenosine were mediated via ERalpha. In addition, the learning and memory ability, neuronal damage, and the levels of amyloid beta-protein (Abeta), phosphorylated Tau Protein (p-Tau), apoptosis, oxidative stress, immune cells, and ERalpha were examined. The antagonistic effect of MPP (1 microM) against adenosine (5 microM) in Abeta25-35 (20 microM, 24 h)-induced N9 and PC-12 cells was also investigated. Adenosine improved learning and memory ability, reduced neuronal damage, downregulated Abeta42/Abeta40, p-Tau, apoptosis, and oxidative stress, transformed immune cells, and increased the expression of ERalpha following Abeta25-35 challenge. MPP could block these effects. Moreover, MPP also blocked the effects of adenosine on the levels of apoptosis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in Abeta25-35-induced N9 and PC-12 cells. Adenosine ameliorated Abeta25-35-induced brain injury by inhibiting apoptosis and oxidative stress, possibly via an ERalpha pathway.
