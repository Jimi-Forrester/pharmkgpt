In this study, utilizing the Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) algorithm, we identified RHBDF2 and TNFRSF10B as feature genes associated with AD pathogenesis. Analyzing data from the GSE33000 dataset, we revealed significant upregulation of RHBDF2 and TNFRSF10B in AD patients, with correlations to age and gender. Interestingly, their expression profile in AD differs notably from that of other neurodegenerative conditions. Functional analysis unveiled their involvement in immune response and various signaling pathways implicated in AD pathogenesis. Furthermore, our study demonstrated the potential of RHBDF2 and TNFRSF10B as diagnostic biomarkers, exhibiting high discrimination power in distinguishing AD from control samples. External validation across multiple datasets confirmed the robustness of the diagnostic model. Moreover, utilizing molecular docking analysis, we identified dinaciclib and tanespimycin as promising small molecule drugs targeting RHBDF2 and TNFRSF10B for potential AD treatment. Our findings highlight the diagnostic and therapeutic potential of RHBDF2 and TNFRSF10B in AD management, shedding light on novel strategies for precision medicine in AD.
