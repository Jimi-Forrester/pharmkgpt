30152845|a|Previous studies have suggested that increased opioid receptor kappa1 (OPRK1) and opioid receptor delta1 (OPRD1) methylation levels are involved in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the present study, the methylation levels of two opioid receptor genes, opioid receptor micro1 (OPRM1) and opioid related nociceptin receptor 1 (OPRL1), were analyzed for their association with AD. Gene methylation levels were measured using bisulfite pyrosequencing in DNA samples derived from blood samples of 51 AD patients and 63 controls. The results indicated that there were significantly elevated promoter methylation levels of OPRM1 and OPRL1 in AD (OPRM1: P=0.007; OPRL1: P=2.987x10-6). Dual-luciferase reporter gene assays demonstrated that the promoter fragments of these two genes were able to promote gene expression (OPRM1: Fold-change=2.616, P=0.003; OPRL1: Fold change=11.395, P=0.007). In addition, receiver operating characteristic analyses further indicated that a methylation panel of four opioid receptor genes (area under the curve=0.848, sensitivity=0.723, and specificity=0.879) performed well in the prediction of AD. These results suggested that opioid receptor genes may be used as potential methylation biomarkers for the diagnosis of AD.
