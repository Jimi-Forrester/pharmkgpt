2626180|t|[Generalized form of cerebral actinomycosis].
2626180|a|The here presented case was a woman 82 years old suffering for many years of arteriosclerotic Parkinson syndrome. During the last 8 months of her life she exhibited excessive talk flow and states of delirium. Twelve days before death she had a generalized attack of convulsions and the consciousness disorder increased. Moreover, meningeal symptoms were observed, a right side reflex syndrome with Babinski sign and temperature up to 38 degrees C were noted. Death occurred on the 9th day of hospitalization with symptoms of increasing circulatory-respiratory insufficiency. Pathomorphological examination revealed in the myocardium, lungs, liver, kidneys and thyroid multiple purulent foci containing actinomycotic granules. Neuropathological examination revealed both in the cortex and white matter the presence of numerous disseminate bodies staining intensively with HE, PAS- and Gram-Weigert positive and negative in the Ziehl-Nielsen method. Their structure, compact or fine-powdered corresponded to actinomyces colonies. They either showed no reaction or were surrounded by a wall of inflammatory cells such as: neutrophilic leucocytes, lymphocytes, plasmatic cells and histiocytes. The microabscesses were not encapsulated. The case was classified to a diffuse form of brain actinomycosis. The etiopathogenesis of the changes and the clinical-morphological correlations of this very rare infectious disease of the central nervous system are discussed.
