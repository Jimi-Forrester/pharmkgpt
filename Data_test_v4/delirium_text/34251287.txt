34251287|t|NM101 Phase III study of NE3107 in Alzheimer's disease: rationale, design and therapeutic modulation of neuroinflammation and insulin resistance.
34251287|a|Recently, the roles of inflammation and insulin resistance in neurodegeneration have become better appreciated. NE3107, an oral small molecule, blood-brain permeable anti-inflammatory insulin sensitizer that binds extracellular signal-regulated kinase, has been shown to selectively inhibit inflammation-driven ERK- and NF-kappaB-stimulated inflammatory mediators, including TNF-alpha, without inhibiting their homeostatic functions. We describe the rationale and design of NM101, the first randomized, multicenter Phase III clinical study to examine the safety and efficacy of 30 week treatment with NE3107 versus placebo in elderly adults with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease. Patients (316) will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio. The co-primary end points measure cognitive function (ADAS Cog12), and functional and behavioral characteristics (ADCS CGIC). Trial registration number: NCT04669028 (Clinicaltrials.gov).
