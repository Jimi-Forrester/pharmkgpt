31782098|a|In the present study, two structurally diverse novel glitazones were designed and synthesized for activation of central PGC-1alpha signaling through stimulation of PPAR-gamma receptor. The functional interaction between PGC-1alpha and PPAR-gamma is a key interaction in the normal physiology of neuroprotective mechanism. Therefore, activation of PPAR-gamma-dependent PGC-1alpha co-activator signaling could be an effective strategy to exhibit neuroprotection in several neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and cerebral ischemia. As part of rational design, analogs were designed manually based on principles of bioisosterism, followed by virtually screened using docking to predict the mode of interaction of compound towards the binding site and molecular dynamic simulation to observe the structural changes that occur during compound interaction with active site. The designed two glitazones (G1, G2) were synthesized and structurally analyzed. As part of evaluation, synthesized glitazones were subjected for preliminary neuroprotective evaluation in Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) intoxicated SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. The results indicate that pre-treatment with synthesized glitazones have increased the percentage cell viability, protected the cell morphology, and decreased the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1beta, TNF-alpha), lipid peroxide (LPO), and nitric oxide (NO) level in LPS intoxicated SH-SY5Y cells. Interestingly, among the two glitazones, G2 has shown significant neuroprotection in comparison to G1 and neuroprotective effect exerted by G2 was similar and comparable with the standard pioglitazone. Altogether, neuroprotection exhibited by this non-thiazolidione-based glitazones during neuroinflammatory conditions may be attributed to the activation of central PGC-1alpha signaling via PPAR-gamma receptor.
