38106335|a|Background: Caffeine is the most widely consumed psychostimulant. Despite this, the effects of acute caffeine intake on brain metabolite levels remain largely unknown. We aimed to investigate the effect of acute caffeine intake on brain metabolite concentrations in different caffeine consumption habit groups and to explore the association between metabolite changes and sleepiness. Methods: Forty-five healthy adults were divided into groups based on their daily caffeine consumption: >=1 cup/day, <1 cup/day, and no consumption. The exclusion criteria were the presence of neurological disorder, habitual consumption of mind-altering substances, and individuals who were unable to undergo magnetic resonance imaging. Mescher-Garwood point resolved spectroscopy and conventional spectroscopy data were acquired at 3 Tesla from voxels in the thalamus and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). Subjective sleepiness was measured with the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale. Results: The results of two-way repeated measures analysis of variance indicated a significant interaction effect between time and group for glutamate, glycerylphosphocholine and phosphocholine (GPC + PCH), myo-inositol, glutamate + glutamine (Glx), and creatine and phosphocreatine (Cr + PCr) of the thalamus (all P<0.01), and glutamate (P<0.0001), GPC + PCH (P=0.016), and Glx (P<0.0001) of the PCC. The change between pre- and post-caffeine intake results with significant reductions in gamma-aminobutyric acid-positive macromolecule (GABA+) (thalamus, P=0.011), Glx (thalamus, P=0.002), glutamate (PCC, P<0.0001), and significant increments in GPC + PCH (thalamus, P=0.012 and PCC, P<0.0001), myo-inositol (thalamus, P=0.009), and Glx (PCC, P<0.0001). The change among the groups, with the >=1 cup/day was significantly higher than the <1 cup/day or no consumption for glutamate (PCC, P=0.028), GPC (thalamus, P=0.001; PCC, P=0.026), and Cr + PCr (PCC, P=0.035); >=1 cup/day was significantly lower than <1 cup/day and no consumption for glutamate (thalamus, P<0.0001), Cr + PCr (thalamus, P=0.003), Glx (thalamus, P=0.014), and myo-inositol (PCC, P=0.009). Bivariate correlation analysis revealed that GABA+ in the thalamus voxel (r=-0.7676; P<0.0001) was negatively correlated with subjective sleepiness. Conclusions: Higher caffeine consumption had a significant impact on brain metabolites. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy was sensitive in measuring brain metabolite fluctuations after caffeine intake, particularly the levels of GABA+ in the thalamus, which was significantly correlated with sleepiness.
