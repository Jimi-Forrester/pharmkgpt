38818372|a|Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination has become the most effective countermeasure in the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. However, vaccination is associated with side effects. This narrative review focuses on central nervous system (CNS) manifestations following COVID-19 vaccination and provides a summary of the potential underlying mechanisms and methods of diagnosis and management of the vaccination-related CNS manifestations. Headache, myalgia, optic neuritis, seizure, multiple sclerosis, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis and encephalitis, delirium, acute transverse myelitis, and stroke have been reported after COVID-19 vaccination. Constant headache and myalgia are common manifestations that may necessitate further clinical investigation for stroke. To limit consequences, it is imperative to follow standard treatment protocols for each neurological disorder following COVID-19 vaccination. Immunosuppressive medication can be helpful in the treatment of seizures following vaccination since the immune response is involved in their etiology. Clinicians should be aware of the manifestations after COVID-19 vaccination to respond promptly and effectively. Clinical guidelines for the management of CNS manifestations following COVID-19 vaccination are in high demand and would be useful in each new SARS-CoV-2 variant pandemic.
