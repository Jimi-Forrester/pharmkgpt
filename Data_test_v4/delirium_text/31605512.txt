31605512|a|Numerous recent studies have been performed to elucidate the function of microglia, macrophages, and astrocytes in inflammatory diseases of the central nervous system. Regarding myeloid cells a core pattern of activation has been identified, starting with the activation of resident homeostatic microglia followed by recruitment of blood borne myeloid cells. An initial state of proinflammatory activation is at later stages followed by a shift toward an-anti-inflammatory and repair promoting phenotype. Although this core pattern is similar between experimental models and inflammatory conditions in the human brain, there are important differences. Even in the normal human brain a preactivated microglia phenotype is evident, and there are disease specific and lesion stage specific differences in the contribution between resident and recruited myeloid cells and their lesion state specific activation profiles. Reasons for these findings reside in species related differences and in differential exposure to different environmental cues. Most importantly, however, experimental rodent studies on brain inflammation are mainly focused on autoimmune encephalomyelitis, while there is a very broad spectrum of human inflammatory diseases of the central nervous system, triggered and propagated by a variety of different immune mechanisms.
