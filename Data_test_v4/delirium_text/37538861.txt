37538861|a|Objective: To investigate the chemical constituents from the leaves of Jatropha curcas and evaluate their inhibition on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated BV-2 microglia cells. Methods: The n-BuOH extract of the leaves of J. curcas was isolated by macroporous adsorption resin, silica gel, ODS, column chromatography and semi-preparative HPLC. The structures of the compounds were identified by MS, NMR, ECD, and other spectroscopic methods. In addition, anti-neuroinflammatory effects of isolated compounds were evaluated by measuring the production of nitric oxide (NO) in over-activated BV-2 cells. Results: Seventeen compounds, including (7R,8S)-crataegifin A-4-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside (1), (8R,8'R)-arctigenin (2), arctigenin-4'-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside (3), (-)-syringaresinol (4), syringaresinol-4'-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside (5), (-)-pinoresinol (6), pinoresinol-4'-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside (7), buddlenol D (8), (2R,3R)-dihydroquercetin (9), (2S,3S)-epicatechin (10), (2R,3S)-catechin (11), isovitexin (12), naringenin-7-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside (13), chamaejasmin (14), neochamaejasmin B (15), isoneochamaejasmin A (16), and tomentin-5-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside (17) were isolated and identified. Compounds 2, 4 and 8 significantly inhibited the release of NO in BV-2 microglia activated by LPS, with IC50 values of 18.34, 29.33 and 26.30 mumol/L, respectively. Conclusion: Compound 1 is a novel compound, and compounds 2, 3, 8, 14-17 are isolated from Jatropha genus for the first time. In addition, the lignans significantly inhibited NO release and the inhibitory activity was decreased after glycosylation.
