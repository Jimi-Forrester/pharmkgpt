37038101|a|BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic kidney disease frequently develop neurological complications including confusion and altered consciousness. Non-convulsive status epilepticus, which is characterized by a change in behavior and/or mental process accompanied by epileptiform discharges on electroencephalogram in the absence of convulsive seizures, is one of the overlooked causes of altered consciousness. The incidence and precise pathophysiological mechanism of non-convulsive status epilepticus in patients with kidney disease, and especially in patients with electrolyte disturbances, remains unknown. We recently treated an older patient with chronic kidney disease and severe hyperkalemia in whom non-convulsive status epilepticus developed following a correction of severe hyperkalemia. CASE PRESENTATION: An 82-year-old male was admitted to our hospital at midnight because of weakness of all four limbs (Day 1). He underwent urgent hemodialysis for severe hyperkalemia (9.84 mEq/L) and his serum potassium concentration decreased to 4.97 mEq/L. He regained full consciousness and his limb weakness improved on the morning of Day 2, but he became confused in the evening. Electroencephalogram revealed repeated low-voltage ictal discharges in the right occipital region and a diagnosis of non-convulsive status epilepticus was made. Following medication with fosphenytoin and phenytoin, the patient became fully alert and orientated on Day 8. CONCLUSION: We speculate that a rapid correction of hyperkalemia was the possible cause of non-convulsive status epilepticus development. To our knowledge, this is the first report of non-convulsive status epilepticus from a potassium abnormality. We described a case of this condition in detail and summarized 78 previous case reports of non-convulsive status epilepticus with kidney disease or electrolyte disturbances.
