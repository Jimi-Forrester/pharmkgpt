18997300|a|Selenium is known for its antioxidant properties, making selenoproteins candidate molecules for mitigation of neurological disorders in which oxidative stress has been implicated. The selenium transport protein, selenoprotein P, is essential for neuronal survival and function. We sought to determine whether selenoprotein P expression is associated with Alzheimer's disease pathology. We examined postmortem tissue from individuals with the hallmark lesions of Alzheimer's disease and individuals without these lesions. Selenoprotein P immunoreactivity was co-localized with amyloid-beta plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Dense-core and other non-diffuse amyloid-beta plaques were nearly always associated with selenoprotein P immunopositive cells. Analysis of spatial distribution showed a significant association between amyloid-beta plaques and selenoprotein P. Numerous cells also exhibited immunoreactivity to selenoprotein P and intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles. Confocal microscopy confirmed co-localization of amyloid-beta protein and selenoprotein P. These findings suggest an association of selenoprotein P with Alzheimer's pathology.
