13679041|a|Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are known to be associated with a number of pathological conditions, such as diabetes mellitus, Alzheimer's disease, uremia, as well as with normal aging. This study was undertaken to investigate whether Nepsilon-(carboxymethyl)lysine (CML), a major structure among numerous AGEs, engenders hepatic AGE clearance. For this purpose uptake of BSA substituted with heterogeneous AGEs or with CML only was monitored in vivo and in cultured hepatic scavenger cells. Here, we show that following intravenous administration of 125I-AGE-BSA and 125I-CML-BSA, blood radioactivity was reduced by 50% after 50s and >100 min, respectively. Recoveries from the circulation at 6 min after injection were: 5% for AGE-BSA, 95% for CML-BSA. More than 80% of the injected AGE-BSA was recovered from the liver. AGE-BSA, but not CML-BSA, was avidly endocytosed by cultured liver scavenger cells. Our results suggest that CML does not engender AGE-BSA clearance. Macromolecules substituted with CML only may escape elimination and cause pathological effects.
