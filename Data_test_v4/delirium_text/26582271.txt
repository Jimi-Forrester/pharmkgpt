26582271|t|The preferential accumulation of heavy metals in different tissues following frequent respiratory exposure to PM2.5 in rats.
26582271|a|This study aimed to explore the pattern of accumulation of some of main heavy metals in blood and various organs of rats after exposed to the atmospheric fine particulate matter (PM2.5). Rats were randomly divided into control and three treatment groups (tracheal perfusion with 10 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg of PM2.5 suspension liquid, respectively). Whole blood and the lung, liver, kidney, and cerebral cortex were harvested after rats were treated and sacrificed. The used heavy metals were detected using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) instrument. As results, Lead was increased in the liver, lung and cerebral cortex and the level of manganese was significantly elevated in the liver and cerebral cortex in PM2.5 treated rats. Besides, arsenic was prominently enriched both in cerebral cortex and in blood, and so did the aluminum in the cerebral cortex and the copper in the liver. However, cadmium, chromium and nickel have shown no difference between the control group and the three PM2.5 treated groups. Following the exposure of PM2.5, different heavy metals are preferentially accumulated in different body tissues.
