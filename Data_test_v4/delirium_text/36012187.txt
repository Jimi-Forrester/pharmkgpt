36012187|a|The low-density-lipoprotein receptors represent a family of pleiotropic cell surface receptors involved in lipid homeostasis, cell migration, proliferation and differentiation. The family shares common structural features but also has significant differences mainly due to tissue-specific interactors and to peculiar proteolytic processing. Among the receptors in the family, recent studies place low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 8 (LRP8) at the center of both neurodegenerative and cancer-related pathways. From one side, its overexpression has been highlighted in many types of cancer including breast, gastric, prostate, lung and melanoma; from the other side, LRP8 has a potential role in neurodegeneration as apolipoprotein E (ApoE) and reelin receptor, which are, respectively, the major risk factor for developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the main driver of neuronal migration, and as a gamma-secretase substrate, the main enzyme responsible for amyloid formation in AD. The present review analyzes the contributions of LDL receptors, specifically of LRP8, in both cancer and neurodegeneration, pointing out that depending on various interactions and peculiar processing, the receptor can contribute to both proliferative and neurodegenerative processes.
