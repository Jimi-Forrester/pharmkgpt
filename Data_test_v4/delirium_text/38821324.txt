38821324|a|Chronic stress (CS) is critically involved in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis resulting in cognitive disturbance. Also, amyloid precursor protein (APP) related gens, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and stress increases AD-related pathogenesis through increasing APP, all are important players in the development of AD. Herein, we explore the possible neuroprotective and anti-amnestic effect of quercetin (QUER) on cognitive deficits induced by scopolamine (SCOP) in stressed rats. Stress induction was performed by exposed of rats to 2-h chronic restraint stress for 10 days. Then rats were supplemented with QUER (25 mg/kg/day oral gavage, for 1 month). Ratswere submitted to intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of SCOP (1 mg/kg) during the final 9 days of QUER supplementation to induce dementia like condition. Following the interventions, behavioral tests [elevated plus maze (EPM) and novel object recognition memory (NORM)] was examined to analysis the cognitive functions. Meanwhile, prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus of brain were used for gene expression and biochemical studies. Also, the plasma corticosterone (CORT) level was measured. We established that administration of QUER ameliorated the SCOP-related memory impairment. Also, QUER decreased stress related anxiety like behaviors in the EPM. QUER also altered the interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) levels in both PFC and hippocampus of SCOP treated rats in stress and non-stress conditions. We found that QUER increased APP and amyloid precursor-like protein 2 (APLP2) mRNA expression in both non-stress and stressed rats. Also, our findings imply that QUER suppress the effect of SCOP on cognitive functions. Moreover, decreased APP mRNA expression in the hippocampus were observed following pretreatment of rats with QUER in both stress and non-stress groups. Given that decreased amyloid beta (Abeta) expression in the hippocampus of stressed rats, it can be proposed that elevations in APP mRNA expression by QUER activates non-amyloidogenic pathways leading to reduction in Abeta levels. However, our findings indicate that QUER can be a therapeutic candidate, which exerts an anti-amnesic property against SCOP-induced memory decline. On the other hand, prior QUER administration in stress condition could be a promising approach against AD prevention.
