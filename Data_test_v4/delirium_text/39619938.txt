39619938|a|In recent years, a significant research effort has been underway to explore the effects of low-dose radiation (LDR). Animal models play a key role in various fields of research, including biomedicine, pharmaceutical, environmental, and behavioral studies. The use of animal models has been an invaluable tool in radiation research for understanding radiation biology, assessing radiation risks, and developing strategies for radiation protection and medical management. In the present review, the initial part focuses on the deleterious effects of high-dose radiation, and in correlation to that, in the later part of the review, the emphasis has been given to experimental approaches to explore the beneficial effects of LDR using animal models. This review could help explore the innovative approach for future research targeting the therapeutic role of LDR in various diseases, including depression, Cancer, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease.
