The objective of this study was to determine if altered central noradrenergic (NE) responsiveness is related to aggression in AD. METHODS: Fifteen institutionalized, non-depressed elderly (11 males, four females, mean age 81.5 +/- 5.5) with probable AD, severe cognitive impairment (MMSE mean 3.3 +/- 4.6) and significant behavioral disturbances (Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) score > or = 8) were studied. Growth Hormone (GH) response to clonidine challenge (5 microg/kg) was used as an index of central alpha(2)-adrenergic function. RESULTS: When patients were divided into those with preserved GH response (GH maximum change from baseline > 0, n = 6) and those with blunted GH response (GH maximum change from baseline < or = 0, n = 9) there were significant differences in levels of aggression as measured by the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CAMI) physical aggression subscale (p = .026). Patients with blunted GH response also had significantly higher levels of aggression against others on the retrospective Overt Aggression Scale (p = 0.027). CONCLUSIONS: Certain types of physically aggressive behaviors are associated with a blunted GH response to clonidine challenge. This finding is consistent with compensatory down-regulation of post-synaptic alpha(2)-adrenergic receptors in response to enhanced NE outflow in aggressive AD patients.
