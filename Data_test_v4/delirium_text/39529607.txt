This study aimed to investigate the involvement of ER stress in the onset of pulpitis. METHODS: Immunohistochemical analysis was conducted on human teeth extracted for orthodontic reasons. The effects of tunicamycin (TM), an inducer of ER stress, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and 4mu8c, an inhibitor of inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1) on cultured human dental pulp cells (hDPCs) were also examined. RESULTS: The expressions of two ER stress markers, X-box binding protein (XBP)-1 and binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP)/78 kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78), were found in the human pulp tissues of a decayed tooth that had not developed irreversible acute pulpitis, but not in an impacted tooth without inflammation in pulp tissue. Both TM and LPS increased the mRNA levels of XBP-1, interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-8, whereas TM, but not LPS, enhanced the mRNA expression of BiP/GRP78 in hDPCs. 4mu8c significantly suppressed the increased level of XBP-1 by LPS. CONCLUSION: This study is the first to demonstrate that XBP-1, in addition to inflammatory cytokines, may participate in the onset of pulpitis through IRE1. These findings provide a more comprehensive understanding of pulpitis pathogenesis through the cooperation of ER stress and inflammatory cytokines.
