36790201|t|Factors Associated With Delirium in Children: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
36790201|a|OBJECTIVES: Pediatric delirium (PD) is a neuropsychiatric syndrome caused by a complex interplay between predisposing factors (e.g., age, cognitive impairment), acute illness, and environmental triggers. PD is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. The objective of this study is to systematically review and evaluate factors associated with PD in hospitalized pediatric patients. DATA SOURCES: A systematic search of PubMed, Embase, Ovid Medline, Web- of-Science, Cochrane, CIHNAL, and Google Scholar databases was conducted for relevant studies (1990-2022). STUDY SELECTION: We included studies that compared pediatric patients with and without delirium. Reviews, editorials, congress abstracts, or studies that did not report factors for PD were excluded. No restrictions were imposed on language. DATA EXTRACTION: Title and abstract were independently screened by two reviewers. Individual characteristics, study design, and outcomes were independently extracted. DATA SYNTHESIS: Categorical dichotomous data were summarized across groups using Mantel-Haenszel odds ratios (ORs) with 95% 95% CIs. Either fixed-effect or random effects models were used as indicated by the results of a heterogeneity test. Of 1,846 abstracts, 24 studies were included. We identified 54 factors studied in univariate analyses, and 27 of these were associated with PD in multivariable analyses. In pooled analyses, greater odds of PD were associated with developmental delay (OR 3.98; 95% CI 1.54-10.26), need for mechanical ventilation (OR 6.02; 95% CI 4.43-8.19), use of physical restraints (OR 4.67; 95% CI 1.82-11.96), and receipt of either benzodiazepines (OR 4.10; 95% CI 2.48-6.80), opiates (OR 2.88; 95% CI 1.89-4.37), steroids (OR 2.02; 95% CI 1.47-2.77), or vasoactive medication (OR 3.68; 95% CI 1.17-11.60). CONCLUSIONS: In this meta-analysis, we identified seven factors associated with greater odds of developing delirium during pediatric critical illness.
