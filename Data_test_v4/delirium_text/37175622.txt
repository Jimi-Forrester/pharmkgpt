37175622|t|Synthesis of Bioactive Aminomethylated 8-Hydroxyquinolines via the Modified Mannich Reaction.
37175622|a|8-hydroxyquinoline (oxine) is a widely known and frequently used chelating agent, and the pharmacological effects of the core molecule and its derivatives have been studied since the 19th century. There are several synthetic methods to modify this core. The Mannich reaction is one of the most easily implementable examples, which requires mild reaction conditions and simple chemical reagents. The three components of the Mannich reaction are a primary or secondary amine, an aldehyde and a compound having a hydrogen with pronounced activity. In the modified Mannich reaction, naphthol or a nitrogen-containing naphthol analogue (e.g., 8-hydroxyquinoline) is utilised as the active hydrogen provider compound, thus affording the formation of aminoalkylated products. The amine component can be ammonia and primary or secondary amines. The aldehyde component is highly variable, including aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes. Based on the pharmacological relevance of aminomethylated 8-hydroxyquinolines, this review summarises their syntheses via the modified Mannich reaction starting from 8-hydroxyquinoline, formaldehyde and various amines.
