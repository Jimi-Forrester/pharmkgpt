33720896|t|Is Weight Loss More Severe in Older People with Dementia?
33720896|a|Weight loss, a hallmark feature of dementia, is associated with higher mortality in older people. However, there is a lack of consensus in the literature as to whether the weight loss commonly observed in older people with dementia results from reduced energy intake and/or increased energy expenditure. Understanding the cause of energy imbalance in older people with dementia would allow more targeted interventions to avoid detrimental health effects in this vulnerable group. In this paper, we review studies that have considered weight change, energy intake, and energy expenditure in older people with and without dementia. We critically assess the studies' methodology and outline the various factors which may decrease and increase energy intake and expenditure respectively in older people with and without dementia. Current available literature does not support the view that there is a lower energy intake and/or a higher energy expenditure in older people with dementia when compared to those without dementia. The need for more high-quality studies is also highlighted in order to shed more light towards this issue which continues to elude researchers and clinicians alike.
