36293204|a|The endothelial cells of the blood-brain barrier adhere closely, which is provided by tight junctions (TJs). The aim of the study was to assess the damage to the endothelial TJs in pregnancy, complicated by fetal growth restriction (FGR) and circulatory centralization (brain-sparing effect, BS). The serum concentrations of NR1 subunit of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NR1), nucleoside diphosphate kinase A (NME1), S100 calcium-binding protein B (S100B), occludin (OCLN), claudin-5 (CLN5), and zonula occludens protein - 1 (zo-1), and the placental expressions of OCLN, claudin-4 (CLN4), CLN5, and zo-1 were assessed with ELISA. The significantly higher serum NME1 concentrations and the serum CLN5/zo-1 index were observed in FGR pregnancy with BS, as compared to the FGR group without BS. The FGR newborns with BS were about 20 times more likely to develop an intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) than the FGR infants without BS. The cerebroplacental ratio (CPR) allowed to predict the IVH in growth-restricted fetuses. The significantly lower placental CLN4 expression was observed in the FGR group with BS and who postnatally developed an IVH, as compared to the growth-restricted infants with BS without IVH signs. Pregnancy complicated by FGR and BS is associated with the destabilization of the fetal blood-brain barrier. The IVH in newborns is reflected in the inhibition of the placental CLN4 expression, which may be a useful marker in the prediction of an IVH among growth-restricted fetuses.
