14558486|a|Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), a condition affecting the elderly in a way similar to that of Alzheimer's disease, results from amyloid deposition within small and medium arteries of the cerebral leptomeninges and cerebral cortex. Next to atheromatosis, amyloidosis is the second most frequent cause of cerebral haemorrhage, especially recurrent. The most recent publications suggest that amyloidosis may also cause transient ischaemic attacks (TIA), cerebral infarcts, Binswanger's type leukoencephalopathy, symptoms resembling these of cerebral pseudotumour, and other dysfunctions. A definite diagnosis of cerebral amyloid angiopathy may be determined by autopsy, and sometimes intravital cerebral biopsy is performed. A clinical diagnosis of probable CAA is based on the presence of multiple superficial haemorrhages in the elderly people without hypertension. No CAA treatment methods are known yet. However, to prevent haemorrhages in CAA it is important that anticoagulants and antiplatelet drugs should be avoided in the treatment of cerebral and other ischaemic disorders, because of an increased risk for haemorrhage.
