35566716|t|Association between Early Mobilization in the ICU and Psychiatric Symptoms after Surviving a Critical Illness: A Multi-Center Prospective Cohort Study.
35566716|a|This is a prospective multicenter cohort study aiming to investigate the association between early mobilization (EM), defined as a rehabilitation level of sitting at the edge of the bed or higher within 72 h of ICU admission, and psychiatric outcome. Consecutive patients, admitted to the ICU for more than 48 h, were enrolled. The primary outcome was the incidence of psychiatric symptoms at 3 months after hospital discharge defined as the presence of any of three symptoms: depression, anxiety, or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Risk ratio (RR) and multiple logistic regression analysis were used. As a sensitivity analysis, two methods for inverse probability of treatment weighting statistics were performed. Of the 192 discharged patients, 99 (52%) were assessed. The patients who achieved EM had a lower incidence of psychiatric symptoms compared to those who did not (25% vs. 51%, p-value 0.008, odds ratio (OR) 0.27, adjusted p = 0.032). The RR for psychiatric symptoms in the EM group was 0.49 [95% Confidence Interval, 0.29-0.83]. Sensitivity analysis accounting for the influence of death, loss to follow-up (OR 0.28, adjusted p = 0.008), or potential confounders (OR 0.49, adjusted p = 0.046) consistently showed a lower incidence of psychiatric symptoms in the EM group. EM was consistently associated with fewer psychiatric symptoms.
