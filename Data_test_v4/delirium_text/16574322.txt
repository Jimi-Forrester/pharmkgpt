16574322|t|Polymorphisms in the phosphate and tensin homolog gene are not associated with late-onset Alzheimer's disease.
16574322|a|The varepsilon4 allele of the APOE locus is the only confirmed risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). The phosphate and tensin homolog (PTEN) gene is both a biological and positional candidate gene for LOAD. Eight polymorphisms spanning this gene were selected from dbSNP and genotyped in pooled DNA samples of both cases and controls. No evidence for association with LOAD was obtained in this study although further investigation revealed low levels of linkage disequlibrium (LD) between the genotyped SNPs. Our results suggest that it is unlikely that genetic variation within the PTEN gene contributes to risk of LOAD.
