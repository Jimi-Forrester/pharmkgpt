39193006|a|Background: The ethical challenges faced by physicians when patients or their families refuse medical interventions are particularly complex in geriatric care. This manuscript explores the delicate balance between professional recommendations and patient autonomy, focusing on the nuanced decisions surrounding enteral nutrition in older patients. Methods: Two case studies are presented: a 99-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, diabetes, and coronary heart disease, and an 82-year-old man with Alzheimer's disease. Both cases involve the recommendation of a nasogastric tube for enteral nutrition, and the subsequent patient and family responses to this intervention. Results: In the first case, the patient and her family initially refused the tube due to personal beliefs and financial concerns, leading to a focus on psychological support and symptom management. The patient eventually agreed to the tube, but tragically passed away shortly after. In contrast, the second case resulted in the patient's family agreeing to the tube after a thorough discussion, leading to a successful recovery and the patient's ability to eat orally 6 months later. Conclusions: The cases underscore the importance of patient-centered care, clear communication, and empathy in geriatric medicine. They highlight the need for healthcare providers to respect patient autonomy, be aware of their own biases, and engage in open dialogue with patients and families. The manuscript advocates for a nuanced approach to medical ethics, where the patient's journey is guided with respect and care, honoring their wishes while striving for the best possible outcomes.
