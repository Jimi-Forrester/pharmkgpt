33093258|t|Two cases of a prolonged excited delirium syndrome after chloromethcathinone ingestion.
33093258|a|Synthetic cathinones have become popular drugs of abuse. We describe our recent experience with two highly agitated patients following ingestion of the cathinone derivative chloromethcathinone, and cannabis. Both patients suffered from excited delirium syndromes that lasted for over 24 hours. Clinicians should be aware of this phenomenon, especially since routine toxicology screenings do not detect the presence of these agents.
