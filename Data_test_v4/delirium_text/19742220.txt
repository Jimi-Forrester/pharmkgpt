19742220|t|Inhalant abuse: A clinic-based study.
19742220|a|BACKGROUND: There are very few studies reporting inhalant abuse/dependence from India. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Consecutive treatment seeking inhalant abuse cases (n = 21) were studied for the sociodemographic and clinical profile by using a semi-structured interview schedule. RESULTS: A TYPICAL CASE PROFILE WAS: unmarried male (100%), mean age 19 years, government school background (76%), unemployed (43%) or student (38%), urban nuclear family (86%), middle socioeconomic status (76%), and poor social support (62%); inhalant dependence (81%), inhalants being the only substance of abuse (33%) and of first or second preference (76%). Duration of inhalant use ranged 6-60 (mean 16) months. All subjects abused typewriter erasing fluid by sniffing (67%), huffing (19%) or bagging (14%). Initiation was out of curiosity (62%), under peer pressure (24%), or as a substitute (14%). Craving was more common (90%) than withdrawal (57%). Almost half of the cases (48%) had a family history for substance dependence. All cases were impaired, more so in family and educational/occupational domains. CONCLUSIONS: The results depict that easy availability, cheap price, faster onset of action, and a regular high makes inhalant a substance of abuse especially among the urban youth.
