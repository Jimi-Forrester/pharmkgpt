26901394|a|This study examines the types of benefits and drawbacks of a sample of daughter and daughter-in-law caregivers (CG) of people with dementia and explores the predictors associated with the identified benefits and drawbacks. The current study used a secondary analysis of a purposive sample of 102 daughters or daughters-in-law living in Northeast Ohio who were required to be using at least 8 hours of paid services per week to help in caring for their care recipient (CR) with Alzheimer's disease or other memory problems. Logistic regression was used. All respondents answered that there were benefits of having the paid help, but 51% of them reported drawbacks as well. The analyses revealed that predictors of each identified benefit and drawback were different. Information about benefits and drawbacks of paid help is useful for service providers to design better services for CGs of people with dementia.
