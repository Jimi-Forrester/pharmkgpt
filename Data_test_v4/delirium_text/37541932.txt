37541932|t|The Relationship of MRI-Derived Alzheimer's and Cerebrovascular-Related Signatures With Level of and Change in Health and Financial Literacy.

Less is known about how these structural neuroimaging markers associate with other critical behaviors. We investigated associations of AD-CT and WMH volumes with a composite index of health and financial literacy given that the ability to access, understand, and utilize health and financial information significantly influences older adults' health outcomes. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS: Participants were 303 adults without dementia (age~80 years; 74% women) from the Rush Memory and Aging Project. MEASUREMENTS: Baseline 3T MRI T1-weighted structural and T2-weighted FLAIR data were used to assess AD-CT and WMH volumes, respectively. Literacy was measured using questions designed to assess comprehension of health and financial information and concepts, yielding a total literacy score. Multivariable linear mixed effects regression models determined the relationship of each neuroimaging marker, first separately and then combined, with the level of and change in literacy. RESULTS: Reduced AD-CT and higher WMH at baseline were each associated with lower levels of literacy; only AD-CT was associated with the rate of decline in literacy over time. The association of AD-CT with change in literacy persisted when both neuroimaging markers were included in the same model. CONCLUSIONS: The cortical thickness signature of AD predicts changes in health and financial literacy in nondemented older adults suggesting that the multidimensional construct of health and financial literacy relies on specific brain networks implicated in AD.
