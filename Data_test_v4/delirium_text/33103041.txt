33103041|t|Oxidative stress in elderly population: A prevention screening study.
33103041|a|BACKGROUND: Aging is a multifactorial phenomenon, characterized by a progressive decline in the efficiency of biochemical and physiological processes and an increased susceptibility to disease. There is increasing evidence that aging and age-related disease are correlated with an oxidative stress (OS) condition. The latter is characterized by an imbalance between reactive species (RS), in particular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidant reserve. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to evaluate the two main markers of oxidative stress, plasmatic peroxide concentration (through d-ROMs FAST test, derivates-Reactive Oxygen Metabolites) and plasmatic antioxidant power measured by iron-reducing power (PAT test, Plasma Antioxidant Test) in 290 apparently healthy volunteers over 60, and their possible correlation with age and gender. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human capillary blood samples from healthy volunteers were used in this observational study for the evaluation of the markers of OS. RESULTS: The data obtained broadly demonstrate that the majority of elderly people display an OS condition characterized by increased levels of peroxides and a slight reduction in antioxidant reserve. CONCLUSIONS: Seniors have a greater propensity to develop a condition of oxidative stress, and therefore it is important to associate the monitoring of oxidative stress markers and, if necessary, antioxidant supplementation, with a healthy lifestyle.
