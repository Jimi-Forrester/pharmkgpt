37637167|t|Identification of potential functional peptides involved in demyelinating injury in the central nervous system.
37637167|a|Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory neurologic disease characterized by the demyelinating injury of the central nervous system (CNS). It was reported that the mutant peptide came from myelin proteolipid protein (PLP) and myelin basic protein (MBP) might play a critical role in immunotherapy function of MS. However, endogenous peptides in demyelinating brain tissue of MS and their role in the pathologic process of MS have not been revealed. Here, we performed peptidomic analysis of freshly isolated corpus callosum (CC) from the brains of CPZ-treated mice and normal diet controls of male C57BL/6 mice by LC-MS/MS. Identified a total of 217 peptides were expressed at different levels in MS mice model compared with controls. By performed GO (Gene Ontology) and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) analysis, we found that the precursor protein of these differently expressed peptides (DEPs) were associated with myelin sheath and oxidative phosphorylation. Our study is the first brain peptidomic of MS mice model, revealing the distinct features of DEPs in demyelination brain tissue. These DPEs may provide further insight into the pathogenesis and complexity of MS, which would facilitate the discovery of the potential novel and effective strategy for the treatment of MS.
