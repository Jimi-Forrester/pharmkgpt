34548132|t|Pathophysiology of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome and COVID-19 Lung Injury.
34548132|a|The pathophysiology of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is marked by inflammation-mediated disruptions in alveolar-capillary permeability, edema formation, reduced alveolar clearance and collapse/derecruitment, reduced compliance, increased pulmonary vascular resistance, and resulting gas exchange abnormalities due to shunting and ventilation-perfusion mismatch. Mechanical ventilation, especially in the setting of regional disease heterogeneity, can propagate ventilator-associated injury patterns including barotrauma/volutrauma and atelectrauma. Lung injury due to the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 resembles other causes of ARDS, though its initial clinical characteristics may include more profound hypoxemia and loss of dyspnea perception with less radiologically-evident lung injury, a pattern not described previously in ARDS.
