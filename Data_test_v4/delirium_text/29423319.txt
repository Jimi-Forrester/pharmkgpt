29423319|t|Improvement of long-term memory access with a pro-dopamine regulator in an elderly male: Are we targeting dopamine tone?
29423319|a|With aging, there is decline in both short-term and long-term memory. This effect is magnified by epigenetic insults on specific, dopamine- related genes (e.g., DRD2, DAT1) as well as by impaired or reduced mRNA transcription. In addition, long-term memory ability is positively correlated with dopamine function and there is evidence that aging is associated with a reduction in brain dopamine D2 receptors, with an acceleration seen in aging-induced dementia. As a result, the authors tested the acute effect of a Pro-Dopamine Regulator (KB220Z, liquid Nano variant) on an aspect of long-term memory performance in a 77-year-old, highly functional male, using the Animal Naming Test (ANT). An improvement in long-term memory retrieval had initially been noted during the subject's follow-up neurology exam, after he had been, for other reasons, taking KB220z. The patient had been given a number of ANTs by his primary and, later, another neurologist, from 2013 to 2016. Because the number of ANT observations was small (N = 7 with two groups) and the data uncorrelated, a non-parametric Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test was performed to test mean differences. After KB220z, the patient had much higher scores (p = 0.04762) on the ANT vs. when not taking it. His scores increased from the 30th percentile (pre-test) to the 76th percentile, after the first administration of KB220z and, later, to the 98th percentile, after a second administration of KB220z, six months later. The results indicate that KB220z, given acutely, increased a form of long-term memory retrieval in a highly functional, elderly male. Larger, double-blind, randomized controlled studies are encouraged.
