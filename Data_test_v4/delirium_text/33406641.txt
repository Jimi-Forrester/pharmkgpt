33406641|a|The number of patients with central nervous system disorders is increasing. Despite diligent laboratory and clinical research over the past 30 years, most pharmacologic options for the prevention and long-term treatment of central nervous system disorders and neurodegenerative disorders have been unsuccessful. Therefore, the development of drugs and/or functional foods to prevent the onset of neurodegenerative disorders is highly expected. Several reports have shown that polymethoxylated flavones (PMFs) derived from citrus fruit, such as nobiletin, tangeretin, and 3,3',4',5,6,7,8-heptamethoxyflavone, are promising molecules for the prevention of neurodegenerative and neurological disorders. In various animal models, PMFs have been shown to have a neuroprotective effect and improve cognitive dysfunction with regard to neurological disorders by exerting favorable effects against their pathological features, including oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration, and synaptic dysfunction as well as its related mechanisms. In this review, we describe the profitable and ameliorating effects of citrus-derived PMFs on cognitive impairment and neural dysfunction in various rat and murine models or in several models of central nervous system disorders and identify their mechanisms of action.
