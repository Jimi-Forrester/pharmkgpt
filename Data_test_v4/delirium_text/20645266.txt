20645266|a|INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease is a slowly progressing neurodegenerative disease that presents cognitive impairment, progressive loss of memory and conduct disorders. The main risk factor is advanced age. There is currently no cure for this disease and, consequently, important efforts have been made to describe readily accessible methods that allow it to be diagnosed earlier, as well as more effective treatments. DEVELOPMENT: A great amount of research focused on the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of Alzheimer's disease is being carried out around the world. In this study we review the main aspects involved in the pathological process of the disease, with emphasis on the changes that generate an immune response and the possible diagnostic markers that have been proposed. CONCLUSIONS: Today, a large body of information on Alzheimer's disease is available. Nevertheless, it is still important to continue with research that allows these patients to improve their quality of life by means of earlier and more accurate diagnoses, as well as more appropriate treatments.
