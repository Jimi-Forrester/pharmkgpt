17619342|t|[Diagnosis of dementia in the doctor's office].
17619342|a|Alzheimer's dementia can readily be diagnosed by the general practitioner on the basis of the anamnestic data provided by the patient's relatives and quantified by MMST and DemTect. The diagnosis should be confirmed by a neurologist. EEG and mapping methods reveal slowing of alpha activity, increased theta activity and reduced reactivity reflecting the postulated cholinergic deficit. Toxic effects caused by medication, and the course of the disease can be monitored by means of the EEG. Magnetic resonance tomography and cranial computed tomography are necessary.
