38902110|a|RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: To investigate the potential of T1-weighted imaging (T1WI)-based hippocampal radiomics as imaging markers for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and their efficacy in discriminating between mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia in AD. METHODS: A total of 126 AD patients underwent T1WI-based magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations, along with 108 age-sex-matched healthy controls (HC). This was a retrospective, single-center study conducted from November 2021 to February 2023. AD patients were categorized into two groups based on disease progression and cognitive function: AD-MCI and dementia (AD-D). T1WI-based radiomics features of the bilateral hippocampi were extracted. To diagnose AD and differentiate between AD-MCI and AD-D, predictive models were developed using random forest (RF), logistic regression (LR), and support vector machine (SVM). We compared radiomics features between the AD and HC groups, as well as within the subgroups of AD-MCI and AD-D. Area under the curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were all used to assess model performance. Furthermore, correlations between radiomics features and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores, tau protein phosphorylated at threonine 181 (P-tau-181), and amyloid beta peptide1-42 (Abeta1-42) were analyzed. RESULTS: The RF model demonstrated superior performance in distinguishing AD from HC (AUC=0.961, accuracy=90.8%, sensitivity=90.7%, specificity=90.9%) and in identifying AD-MCI and AD-D (AUC=0.875, accuracy=80.7%, sensitivity=87.2%, specificity=73.2%) compared to the other models. Additionally, radiomics features were correlated with MMSE scores, P-tau-181, and Abeta1-42 levels in AD. CONCLUSION: T1WI-based hippocampal radiomics features are valuable for diagnosing AD and identifying AD-MCI and AD-D.
