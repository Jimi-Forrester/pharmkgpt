38707747|t|Case Report: A giant fecaloma revealed by severe aspiration pneumonia and urinary retention.
38707747|a|Fecaloma is an accumulation of hardened impacted stool typically occurring in the sigmoid colon and rectum. It mainly affects elderly and bedridden patients suffering from chronic constipation and can be revealed by different signs. We report a case of 74-year-old female, with anorexia, Alzheimer's disease, and chronic constipation, who was admitted to the emergency department with complaints of dyspnea and anuria. Clinical examination showed fever, Glasgow Coma Scale score of 13/15, tachycardia with a blood pressure of 100/50 mmHg, polypnea with hypoxia, foci of crepitant rales in pulmonary auscultation and a tender hypogastric mass with mild diffuse abdominal tenderness. Digital rectal examination revealed hard fecal material. Computed tomography (CT) images demonstrated bilateral pulmonary parenchymal condensation and a huge heterogeneous fecaloma in the sigmoid colon and rectum compressing the bladder. Based on these findings, the diagnosis of giant fecaloma causing aspiration pneumonia and urinary retention was retained. Manual disimpaction and bowel enemas were done but they were unsuccessful and surgical treatment was refused. Ultimately the patient died due to septic shock. Early diagnosis should be made to relieve symptoms and prevent complications.
