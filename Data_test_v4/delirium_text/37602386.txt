37602386|t|Intranasal Insulin Treatment Partially Corrects the Altered Gene Expression Profile in the Hippocampus of Developing Rats with Perinatal Iron Deficiency.
37602386|a|BACKGROUND: Perinatal iron deficiency (FeD) targets the hippocampus and leads to long-term cognitive deficits. Intranasal insulin administration improves cognitive deficits in adult humans with Alzheimer's disease and type 2 diabetes and could provide benefits in FeD-induced hippocampal dysfunction. OBJECTIVE: Assess intranasal insulin administration on the hippocampal transcriptome in a developing rat model of perinatal FeD. METHODS: Perinatal FeD was induced using low-iron diet from gestational day 3 until postnatal day (P) 7, followed by an iron sufficient (FeS) diet through P21. Intranasal insulin was administered at a dose of 0.3 IU, twice daily from P8 to P21. Hippocampi were removed on P21 from FeS control, FeD control, FeS insulin, and FeD insulin groups. Total RNA was isolated and profiled using next-generation sequencing. Gene expression profiles were characterized using custom workflows and expression patterns examined using Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (n = 7-9 per group). Select RNAseq results were confirmed via qPCR. RESULTS: Transcriptomic profiling revealed that mitochondrial biogenesis and flux, oxidative phosphorylation, quantity of neurons, CREB signaling in neurons, and RICTOR-based mTOR signaling were disrupted with FeD and positively affected by intranasal insulin treatment with the most benefit observed in the FeD insulin group. CONCLUSIONS: Both perinatal FeD and intranasal insulin administration altered gene expression profile in the developing hippocampus. Intranasal insulin treatment reversed the adverse effects of FeD on many molecular pathways and could be explored as an adjunct therapy in perinatal FeD.
