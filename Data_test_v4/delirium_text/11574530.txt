11574530|t|Pharmacological knock-down of the presenilin 1 heterodimer by a novel gamma -secretase inhibitor: implications for presenilin biology.
11574530|a|Intramembranous cleavage of the beta-amyloid precursor protein by gamma-secretase is the final processing event generating amyloid-beta peptides, which are thought to be causative agents for Alzheimer's disease. Missense mutations in the presenilin genes co-segregate with early-onset Alzheimer's disease, and, recently, a close biochemical linkage between presenilins and the identity of gamma-secretase has been established. Here we describe for the first time that certain potent gamma-secretase inhibitors are able to interfere with the endoproteolytic processing of presenilin 1 (PS1). In addition, we identified a novel gamma-secretase inhibitor, [1S-benzyl-4R-[1-(5-cyclohexyl-2-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzo[e][1,4]diazepin-3(R,S)-ylcarbamoyl)-S-ethylcarbamoyl]-2R-hydroxy-5-phenyl-pentyl]-carbamic acid tert-butyl ester (CBAP), which not only physically interacts with PS1, but upon chronic treatment produces a "pharmacological knock-down" of PS1 fragments. This indicates that the observed accumulation of full-length PS1 is caused by a direct inhibition of its endoproteolysis. The subsequent use of CBAP as a biological tool to increase full-length PS1 levels in the absence of exogenous PS1 expression has provided evidence that wild-type PS1 endoproteolysis is not required either for PS1/gamma-secretase complex assembly or trafficking. Furthermore, in cell-based systems CBAP does not completely recapitulate PS1 loss-of-function phenotypes. Even though the beta-amyloid precursor protein cleavage and the S3 cleavage of the Notch receptor are inhibited by CBAP, an impairment of Trk receptor maturation was not observed.
