34712677|t|Effect of Poor Nutritional Status and Comorbidities on the Occurrence and Outcome of Pneumonia in Elderly Adults.
34712677|a|Background: Malnutrition and comorbidity are two common geriatric syndromes. The pathology of pneumonia is multifactorial, making its diagnosis and management a great challenge. Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) are two main types of pneumonia. However, the effect of geriatric syndromes on pneumonia and its prognosis have not been clearly explored. Methods: We collected the relevant electronic data of inpatients aged over 65 years and diagnosed with pneumonia in the Geriatrics Department Building of the First Affiliated Hospital with Nanjing Medical University between December 2018 and December 2019, and further divided them into HAP group and CAP group. The correlations of age, age-adjusted Charlson Comorbidity Index (aCCI), basic diseases and nutritional indexes (i.e., albumin, electrolyte, hemoglobin) with pneumonia and prognosis were analyzed. We analyzed the associations between infection prognosis/infection level and age, nutritional status, aCCI and underlying diseases, using linear regression model. The box plot was applied to present infection outcome, and the nomogram was built for predicting infection outcomes. We utilized the heat map to show the associations between nutritional status and infection level/outcome in all infected patients, HAP, and CAP. Results: The final study comprised samples of 669 pneumonia patients divided into HAP group (n = 517) and CAP group (n = 152). In all patients, the infection outcome was negatively correlated with age (P = 0.013). The level of albumin was negatively correlated with infection prognosis in all patients (P = 0.03), and negatively correlated with neutrophil count and CRP (P = 0.008, P < 0.001). ACCI was positively correlated with CRP (P = 0.003). The prognosis was negatively associated with age and albumin level. In the patients with basic dementia/Alzheimer's disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease/asthma, the prognosis was worse. Conclusion: There was a correlation between poor nutritional status-related indexes and inflammatory indexes. A poor nutritional status might predict a high risk of pneumonia in elderly adults. Advanced age and comorbidities were risk factors for the occurrence and poor prognosis of pneumonia. Therefore, comorbidities should be well-treated in the elderly with pneumonia.
