33355839|a|This article aimed to summarize the impact and burden of pediatric postintensive care syndrome (PICS-p) in the physical, mental, cognitive, and social health domains after a review of the current pediatric literature in MEDLINE and PubMed. We also aimed to elucidate the limitations of the current evaluation tools used in limited-resource settings. PICS-p can impact a child's life for decades. Most validated tools are time-consuming, require qualifications, and expertise, are often limited to older children, and can evaluate only one domain. A novel, simple, and comprehensive surveillance tool can aid healthcare providers in the early detection and intervention of PICS-p. Further studies should validate and refine the parameters that will enhance the outcomes of pediatric intensive care unit survivors.
