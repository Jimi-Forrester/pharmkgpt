35111542|a|OBJECTIVES: We have observed white turbidity when a midazolam injection is administered from a lateral tube during the administration of a peripheral parenteral nutrition (PPN) solution. The aim of the current study was to determine how to avoid compound changes when co-administering a midazolam injection and a PPN solution. METHODS: Midazolam solutions were prepared by diluting a midazolam injection with a 5% glucose intravenous infusion. We examined the formulation of the midazolam injection and a PPN solution at the concentrations used in a clinical setting for changes in appearance, pH, and midazolam content in test tubes and during administration conditions. RESULTS: With a 1/4.8 dilution of midazolam in undiluted solution, clouding occurred. A strong correlation was revealed between the midazolam content as measured through high-performance liquid chromatography and the mixture's midazolam concentration (R2=0.9918). The capture rate of midazolam infused with PPN solution was 91.0% at a 1/6 dilution, whereas it decreased to <90% at a 1/4.8 dilution. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the administration of a midazolam injection solution diluted by >=6-fold with glucose solution or saline from a side tube during the administration of a PPN solution did not cause changes in composition.
