37738768|a|The identification of effective and druggable cholinesterase inhibitors to treat progressive neurodegenerative Alzheimer's disorder remains a continuous drug discovery hunt. In this perspective, the present study investigates the design and discovery of pyrimidine-morpholine hybrids (5a-l) as potent cholinesterase inhibitors. Palladium-catalyzed Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reaction was employed to introduce the structural diversity on the pyrimidine heterocyclic core. A range of commercially available boronic acids was successfully coupled showing a high functional group tolerance. In vitro cholinesterase inhibitory potential using Ellman's method revealed significantly strong potency. Compound 5h bearing a meta-tolyl substituent at 2-position of pyrimidine ring emerged as a lead candidate against AChE with an inhibitory potency of 0.43 +- 0.42 microM, ~38-fold stronger value than neostigmine (IC50 = 16.3 +- 1.12 microM). Compound 5h also showed the lead inhibition against BuChE with an IC50 value of 2.5 +- 0.04 microM. The kinetics analysis of 5h revealed the non-competitive mode of inhibition against AChE whereas computational modelling results of potent leads depicted diverse contacts with the binding site amino acid residues. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed the stability of biomolecular system, while, ADME analysis demonstrated druglikeness behaviour of potent compounds. Overall, the investigated pyrimidine-morpholine scaffold presented a remarkable potential to be developed as efficacious anti-Alzheimer's drugs.
