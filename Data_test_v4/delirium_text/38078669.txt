38078669|a|OBJECTIVE: A consistent approach to defining cognitive super-ageing is needed to increase the value of research insights that may be gained from studying this population including ageing well and preventing and treating neurodegenerative conditions. This review aims to evaluate the existing definitions of 'super-ageing' with a focus on cognition. METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted across PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, PsycINFO and Google Scholar from inception to 24 July 2023. RESULTS: Of 44 English language studies that defined super-ageing from a cognitive perspective in older adults (60-97 years), most (n = 33) were based on preserved verbal episodic memory performance comparable to that of younger adult in age range 16-65 years. Eleven studies defined super-agers as the top cognitive performers for their age group based upon standard deviations or percentiles above the population mean. Only nine studies included longitudinal cognitive performance in their definitions. CONCLUSIONS: Equivalent cognitive abilities to younger adults, exceptional cognition for age and a lack of cognitive deterioration over time are all meaningful constructs and may provide different insights into cognitive ageing. Using these criteria in combination or individually to define super-agers, with a clear rationale for which elements have been selected, could be fit for purpose depending on the research question. However, major discrepancies including the age range of super-agers and comparator groups and the choice of cognitive domains assessed should be addressed to reach some consensus in the field.
