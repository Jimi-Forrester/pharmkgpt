3751431|t|[Acute traumatic subdural hematoma associated with delirium tremens].
3751431|a|The article is devoted to the difficulties of diagnosing a combination of delirium tremens with acute subdural (epidural) traumatic hematoma. The possibility of such a combination is known from the literature and is confirmed by the author's own observation of 3 cases. Hallucinational excitement of delirium tremens not infrequently masks the symptomatology of subdural hematoma in its latent period. This symptomatology is best expressed in the pre- and post-delirium states. The above pathological state should be differentiated from febrile delirium tremens, alcoholic encephalopathy and a combination of delirium tremens with other neurological diseases.
