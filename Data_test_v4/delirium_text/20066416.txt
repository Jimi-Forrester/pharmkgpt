20066416|t|A comparison of three scores to screen for delirium on the surgical ward.
20066416|a|BACKGROUND: Postoperative delirium is associated with adverse outcome. The aim of this study was to find a valid and easy-to-use tool to screen for postoperative delirium on the surgical ward. METHODS: Data were collected from 88 patients who underwent elective surgery. Delirium screening was performed daily until the sixth postoperative day using the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM), the Nursing Delirium Screening Scale (Nu-DESC), and the Delirium Detection Score (DDS), and the DSM-IV criteria as the gold standard. RESULTS: Seventeen of 88 patients (19%) developed delirium on at least one of the postoperative days according to the gold standard. The DDS scored positive for 40 (45%) patients, the CAM for 15 (17%), and the Nu-DESC for 28 (32%) patients. Sensitivity and specificity were 0.71 and 0.87 for the DDS, 0.75 and 1.00 for the CAM, and 0.98 and 0.92 for the Nu-DESC. The interrater reliability was 0.83 for the Nu-DESC, 0.77 for the DDS, and 1.00 for the CAM. CONCLUSIONS: All scores showed high specificity but differed in their sensitivity. The Nu-DESC proved to be the most sensitive test for screening for a postoperative delirium on the surgical ward followed by the CAM and DDS when compared to the gold standard.
