32357394|t|Oxidative Stress-Generating Antimicrobials, a Novel Strategy to Overcome Antibacterial Resistance.
32357394|a|Antimicrobial resistance is becoming one of the most important human health issues. Accordingly, the research focused on finding new antibiotherapeutic strategies is again becoming a priority for governments and major funding bodies. The development of treatments based on the generation of oxidative stress with the aim to disrupt the redox defenses of bacterial pathogens is an important strategy that has gained interest in recent years. This approach is allowing the identification of antimicrobials with repurposing potential that could be part of combinatorial chemotherapies designed to treat infections caused by recalcitrant bacterial pathogens. In addition, there have been important advances in the identification of novel plant and bacterial secondary metabolites that may generate oxidative stress as part of their antibacterial mechanism of action. Here, we revised the current status of this emerging field, focusing in particular on novel oxidative stress-generating compounds with the potential to treat infections caused by intracellular bacterial pathogens.
