38557928|a|Despite their general good health, an increasing proportion of elderly individuals require surgery due to an increase in average lifespan. However, because of their increased vulnerability, these patients need to be handled carefully to make sure that surgery does not cause more harm than good. Age-related postoperative cognitive disorders (POCD) and postoperative delirium (POD), two serious consequences that are marked by adverse neuropsychologic alterations after surgery, are particularly dangerous for the elderly. In the context of gynecologic procedures, POCD and POD are examined in this narrative review. The main question is how to limit the rates of POCD and POD in older women undergoing gynecologic procedures by maximizing the risk-benefit balance. Three crucial endpoints are considered: (1) surgical procedures to lower the rates of POCD and POD, (2) anesthetic techniques to lessen the occurrence and (3) the identification of individuals at high risk for post-surgery cognitive impairments. Risks associated with laparoscopic gynecologic procedures include the Trendelenburg posture and CO2 exposure during pneumoperitoneum, despite statistical similarities in POD and POCD frequency between laparoscopic and laparotomy techniques. Numerous risk factors are associated with surgical interventions, such as blood loss, length of operation, and position holding, all of which reduce the chance of complications when they are minimized. In order to emphasize the essential role that anesthesia and surgery play in patient care, anesthesiologists are vital in making sure that anesthesia is given as sparingly and quickly as feasible. In addition, people who are genetically predisposed to POCD may be more susceptible to the disorder. The significance of a thorough strategy combining surgical and anesthetic concerns is highlighted in this article, in order to maximize results for senior patients having gynecologic surgery.
