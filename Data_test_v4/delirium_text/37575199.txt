37575199|a|A sustainable synthesis of interesting glycine betaine derivatives from cyclic 3 -amines viz. N-methyl morpholine (NMM), N-methyl piperidine (NMP), and 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO) with numerous aryl diazoacetates 1 in water and under blue LED is reported. Generally, 3 -amines and metal carbenoids (from diazoacetates with transition metal catalysts) provide C-H insertion at the alpha-position of the amines. Computational comparison of the metal carbenoid with the singlet carbene (metal free and generated under blue LED) realized the difference in reactivity. Next, experimental results corroborated the preliminary findings. The products were isolated either by precipitation of the solid or gel-like final products from the aqueous reaction mixture without any chromatographic purification. The reaction mechanism was realized by control experiments. These compounds exhibit selective bactericidal properties against Gram-positive S. aureus, induce lipid droplets (LDs) formation in HePG2 cells and single crystal X-ray diffraction study of their halogenated analogs reveal interesting Hal ...
