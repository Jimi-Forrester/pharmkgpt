37155532|a|Purpose: This study aimed to examine the effectiveness of ultrasound-guided thoracic paravertebral block on postoperative quality of recovery in patients undergoing percutaneous nephrolithotomy. Patients and Methods: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we enrolled patients scheduled for unilateral percutaneous nephrolithotomy. Patients were randomly allocated to receive thoracic paravertebral block either with 20 mL of 0.5% ropivacaine (PVB group) or an equal volume of saline (control group). The primary outcome was the quality of patient recovery at 24 h postoperatively, assessed using the 15-item Quality of Recovery scale. The secondary outcomes included the area under the curve of pain scores over time, time to first rescue analgesia, and postoperative 24 h morphine consumption. Results: We analyzed the data of 70 recruited participants. The median Quality of Recovery-15 score at 24 h postoperatively was 127 (interquartile range, 117-133) in the PVB group, which was significantly higher than 114 (interquartile range, 109-122) in the control group, with a median difference of 10 points (95% confidence interval, 5-14; P<0.001). The area under the curve of pain scores over time was lower in patients receiving thoracic PVB than in those receiving saline block (P<0.001). The median time to first rescue analgesia in the PVB group (10.8 h, interquartile range 7.1-22.8 h) was longer than that in the control group (1.9 h, interquartile range 0.5-4.3 h) (P<0.001). Similarly, the median postoperative 24-hour morphine consumption was nearly half as low in the PVB group as in the control group (P<0.001). The occurrence of postoperative nausea and vomiting, and pruritus were significantly higher in the control group (P=0.016 and P=0.023, respectively). Conclusion: Preoperative ultrasound-guided single injection of thoracic paravertebral block with ropivacaine improved the postoperative quality of recovery and analgesia in patients undergoing percutaneous nephrolithotomy.
