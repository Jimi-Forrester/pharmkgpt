37509017|t|Neutrophil-Lymphocyte Ratio as a Predictor of Cerebral Small Vessel Disease in a Geriatric Community: The I-Lan Longitudinal Aging Study.
37509017|a|Cerebral Small Vessel Disease (CSVD) frequently affects the elderly, with inflammation playing a crucial role in related health complications, including dementia, stroke, and SVD. Studies, including animal experiments, indicate a strong link between inflammation and SVD progression. The Neutrophil-Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR) serves as a possible biomarker for ongoing inflammatory risks. A total of 720 adults aged 50 years or older from the community-based I-Lan Longitudinal Aging Study were included in this study. General linear regression and ordinally logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate the association between NLR and CSVD. We further examined the presence of lacune, microbleed, and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) on brain MRI, which were used to construct a combined CSVD score. The NLR was positively associated with WMH (adjusted r = 0.109, p = 0.003), microbleed (adjusted r = 0.102, p = 0.006), and lacune (adjusted r = 0.100, p = 0.008). After adjustments for smoking, drinking, and physical activity in the ordinal logistic regression analysis, age, gender, brachial Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP), fasting glucose, LDL-cholesterol, and Hs-CRP were compared among subjects with low tertile (T1), medium tertile (T2) and high tertile (T3) NLR. The results showed that T2 vs. T1 had an odds ratio of 1.23 (0.86-1.77); and T3 vs. T1 had an odds ratio of 1.87 (1.29-2.71) of CSVD scores in four groups (zero (reference group), one, two, and three or more). NLR could be used to assess the state of inflammation in cerebral vessels. A significant and positive correlation between NLR and CSVD was verified in this study. However, the practical clinical application of NLR in CSVD patients and prognosis prediction should be validated through more scientific attempts.
