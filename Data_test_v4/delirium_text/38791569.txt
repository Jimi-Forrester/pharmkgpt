38791569|a|Early detection of neurological conditions is critical for timely diagnosis and treatment. Identifying cellular-level changes is essential for implementing therapeutic interventions prior to symptomatic disease onset. However, monitoring brain tissue directly through biopsies is invasive and poses a high risk. Bodily fluids such as blood or cerebrospinal fluid contain information in many forms, including proteins and nucleic acids. In particular, cell-free DNA (cfDNA) has potential as a versatile neurological biomarker. Yet, our knowledge of cfDNA released by brain tissue and how cfDNA changes in response to deleterious events within the brain is incomplete. Mapping changes in cfDNA to specific cellular events is difficult in vivo, wherein many tissues contribute to circulating cfDNA. Organoids are tractable systems for examining specific changes consistently in a human background. However, few studies have investigated cfDNA released from organoids. Here, we examined cfDNA isolated from cerebral organoids. We found that cerebral organoids release quantities of cfDNA sufficient for downstream analysis with droplet-digital PCR and whole-genome sequencing. Further, gene ontology analysis of genes aligning with sequenced cfDNA fragments revealed associations with terms related to neurodevelopment and autism spectrum disorder. We conclude that cerebral organoids hold promise as tools for the discovery of cfDNA biomarkers related to neurodevelopmental and neurological disorders.
