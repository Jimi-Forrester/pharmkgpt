22553912|a|BACKGROUND: Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) is a transcription factor typically expressed with two specific subunits (p50, p65). Investigators have reported that NF-kappaB is activated during the induction of in vitro long term potentiation (LTP), a paradigm of synaptic plasticity and correlate of memory, suggesting that NF-kappaB may be necessary for some aspects of memory encoding. Furthermore, NF-kappaB has been implicated as a potential requirement in behavioral tests of memory. Unfortunately, very little work has been done to explore the effects of deleting specific NF-kappaB subunits on memory. Studies have shown that NF-kappaB p50 subunit deletion (p50-/-) leads to memory deficits, however some recent studies suggest the contrary where p50-/- mice show enhanced memory in the Morris water maze (MWM). To more critically explore the role of the NF-kappaB p50 subunit in synaptic plasticity and memory, we assessed long term spatial memory in vivo using the MWM, and synaptic plasticity in vitro utilizing high frequency stimuli capable of eliciting LTP in slices from the hippocampus of NF-kappaB p50-/- versus their controls (p50+/+). RESULTS: We found that the lack of the NF-kappaB p50 subunit led to significant decreases in late LTP and in selective but significant alterations in MWM tests (i.e., some improvements during acquisition, but deficits during retention). CONCLUSIONS: These results support the hypothesis that the NF-kappa p50 subunit is required in long term spatial memory in the hippocampus.
