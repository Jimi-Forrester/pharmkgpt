25541864|a|Sympathovagal balance, assessed with heart rate variability (HRV), may be altered in intensive care unit (ICU) delirium. HRV was measured in the frequency domain [low frequencies (LF)=0.04-0.15 Hz and high frequencies (HF)=0.15-0.40 Hz] with HF in normalized units (HFnu) to evaluate parasympathetic tone and LF:HF ratio for sympathovagal balance. The authors assessed 726 ICU patients and excluded patients with conditions affecting HRV. No difference could be found between patients with (N=13) and without (N=12) delirium by comparing the mean (+-standard deviation) of the HFnu (75+-7 versus 68+-23) and the LF:HF ratio (-0.7+-1.0 versus -0.1+-1.1). This study suggests that autonomic function is not altered in ICU delirium.
