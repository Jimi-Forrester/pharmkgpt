26514706|t|Use of Transversus Abdominis Plane (TAP) Blocks for Pain Management in Elderly Surgical Patients.
26514706|a|Elderly patients who require surgical interventions often have multiple comorbidities that complicate their intraoperative and postoperative care. Surgical team members should consider all potential problems that elderly patients may experience and base perioperative care on their assessment. This article discusses the use of the transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block in elderly patients undergoing surgical procedures to relieve pain and reduce the use of narcotics or sedatives during the immediate and extended postoperative recovery period. By reducing postoperative pain and the use of sedatives and narcotics, the TAP block improves pain management and helps reduce the incidence of postoperative delirium, pneumonia, urinary retention, and falls.
