38545173|t|Effect of hyperbaric oxygen treatment on patients with heatstroke complicated by multiple organ dysfunction:A retrospective study.
38545173|a|Background: The benefits of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) in treating animals with heat stroke (HS) have been established. This study aims to retrospectively analyze the effect of HBO on multiple organ dysfunction following HS in humans. Methods: Retrospective data were collected from patients with HS admitted to our hospital in the past 7 years. Patients were categorized into groups based on whether they received HBO therapy. The study compared various factors, including sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) and acute physiology and chronic health evaluation-II (APACHE-II) scores, mortality rates, neurological function scores, serum myocardial enzyme levels, liver, kidney, and coagulation function indicators, blood routine results, electrolyte levels, and modified Barthel index (MBI) score for standard daily living ability before treatment and after 2 and 4 weeks of treatment. Results: The mortality rates in the HBO and control group were 0% and 8.49%, respectively. Upon admission, the HBO group had higher SOFA and APACHE-II scores and lower neurological, coagulation, and liver functions than those of the control group. HBO treatment significantly improved SOFA, APACHE-II, and neurological scores while relieving levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, creatinine, and myocardial enzymes. Additionally, it mitigating lymphocyte and platelet count decline caused by HS. The MBI score was significantly enhanced after treatment in the HBO group. Conclusions: Clinical practice advocates administering HBO therapy to patients with severe illness, organ damage, and nerve impairment. Compared with conventional treatment, combined HBO therapy demonstrated superior efficacy in alleviating multiple organ dysfunction and improving daily living ability in patients with HS.
