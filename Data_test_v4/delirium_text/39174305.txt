39174305|t|Unraveling mitochondrial dysfunction: comprehensive perspectives on its impact on neurodegenerative diseases.
39174305|a|Neurodegenerative diseases represent a significant challenge to modern medicine, with their complex etiology and progressive nature posing hurdles to effective treatment strategies. Among the various contributing factors, mitochondrial dysfunction has emerged as a pivotal player in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative disorders. This review paper provides a comprehensive overview of how mitochondrial impairment contributes to the development of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, driven by bioenergetic defects, biogenesis impairment, alterations in mitochondrial dynamics (such as fusion or fission), disruptions in calcium buffering, lipid metabolism dysregulation and mitophagy dysfunction. It also covers current therapeutic interventions targeting mitochondrial dysfunction in these diseases.
