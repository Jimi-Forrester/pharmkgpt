3281716|t|Complications of concurrent lithium and electroconvulsive therapy: a review of clinical material and theoretical considerations.
3281716|a|Several anecdotal reports and two retrospective chart reviews have examined complications of concurrent lithium and electroconvulsive treatment. Discussions have generally been contradictory or confusing. This article reviews the literature and particularly emphasizes theoretical considerations and mechanisms, concluding (A) that lithium may act synergistically with neuromuscular blockers, but the effect is not clinically significant, and (B) that repeated electroconvulsive seizures may cause a toxic delirium in patients concurrently taking lithium.
