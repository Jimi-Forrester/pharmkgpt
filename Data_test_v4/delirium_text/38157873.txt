38157873|t|Cognitive impairment in post-acute COVID-19 syndrome: a scoping review.
38157873|a|Emerging studies indicate the persistence of symptoms beyond the acute phase of COVID-19. Cognitive impairment has been observed in certain individuals for months following infection. Currently, there is limited knowledge about the specific cognitive domains that undergo alterations during the post-acute COVID-19 syndrome and the potential impact of disease severity on cognition. The aim of this review is to examine studies that have reported cognitive impairment in post-acute COVID-19, categorizing them into subacute and chronic phases. The methodology proposed by JBI was followed in this study. The included studies were published between December 2019 and December 2022. The search was conducted in PubMed, PubMed PMC, BVS - BIREME, Embase, SCOPUS, Cochrane, Web of Science, Proquest, PsycInfo, and EBSCOHost. Data extraction included specific details about the population, concepts, context, and key findings or recommendations relevant to the review objectives. A total of 7,540 records were identified and examined, and 47 articles were included. The cognitive domains most frequently reported as altered 4 to 12 weeks after acute COVID-19 were language, episodic memory, and executive function, and after 12 weeks, the domains most affected were attention, episodic memory, and executive function. The results of this scoping review highlight that adults with post-acute COVID-19 syndrome may have impairment in specific cognitive domains.
