8493063|t|Down syndrome.
8493063|a|Down syndrome remains one of the most common causes of mental retardation. Although knowledge of pathogenesis remains incomplete, recent molecular biologic techniques have identified regions of the 21st chromosome critical for expression of the Down syndrome phenotype, and animal models have helped elucidate the origins of the neurochemical and neuropathologic abnormalities. There also has been an improved understanding of the spectrum of medical complications of this disorder and the need for anticipatory management, including the search for atlantoaxial subluxation and hypothyroidism. With its increased risk of Alzheimer disease, Down syndrome is proving to be a useful model for studying aging. Accompanying greater knowledge has been improved functional outcome. Better medical care has made individuals with Down syndrome healthier; remaining at home through childhood has increased their cognitive function; and availability of increased numbers of group homes and supported employment opportunities has permitted the young adult with Down syndrome to live a more independent and full life. In this climate, the role of the pediatrician in early intervention and anticipatory guidance cannot be overemphasized.
