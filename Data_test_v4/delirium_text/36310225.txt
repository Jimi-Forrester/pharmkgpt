36310225|t|Neuronal Puncta/Aggregate Formation by WT and Mutant UBQLN2.
36310225|a|Protein aggregates are a common feature of nearly all neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Here we describe a method to quickly and accurately measure protein aggregation in cells expressing a fluorescently tagged aggregation-prone protein. This unbiased method obviates the need for manual scoring and facilitates the identification of factors governing protein self-assembly and its downstream consequences for cell heath.
