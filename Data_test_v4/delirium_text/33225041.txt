33225041|a|INTRODUCTION: We aimed at exploring the proportion of patients dying with COVID-19 and concomitant dementia in Italy, as well as their clinical characteristics and trajectories of care. METHODS: The proportion of COVID-19-related deaths occurring in people with dementia and the clinical characteristics of deceased individuals according to their dementia status were explored by considering the medical charts of a representative sample of patients deceased in Italian hospitals (n = 2621). RESULTS: A total of 415 individuals with dementia were identified in the study population, accounting for 15.8% of overall COVID-19-related deaths. Patients with dementia less frequently presented with cough, had lower chance of receiving supportive therapies and intensive care approaches, and showed a faster clinical worsening as compared with individuals with intact cognition. DISCUSSION: Dementia confers a relevant risk of adverse outcomes in case of SARS-CoV-2 infection and influences the clinical presentation, course and management of affected individuals.
