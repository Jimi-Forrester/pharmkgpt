34030620|t|Biomarkers and Tools for Predicting Alzheimer's Disease in the Preclinical Stage.
34030620|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the only leading cause of death for which no disease-modifying therapy is currently available. Over the past decade, a string of disappointing clinical trial results has forced us to shift our focus to the preclinical stage of AD, which represents the most promising therapeutic window. However, the accurate diagnosis of preclinical AD requires the presence of brain beta- amyloid deposition determined by cerebrospinal fluid or amyloid-positron emission tomography, significantly limiting routine screening and diagnosis in non-tertiary hospital settings. Thus, an easily accessible marker or tool with high sensitivity and specificity is highly needed. Recently, it has been discovered that individuals in the late stage of preclinical AD may not be truly "asymptomatic" in that they may have already developed subtle or subjective cognitive decline. In addition, advances in bloodderived biomarker studies have also allowed the detection of pathologic changes in preclinical AD. Exosomes, as cell-to-cell communication messengers, can reflect the functional changes of their source cell. Methodological advances have made it possible to extract brain-derived exosomes from peripheral blood, making exosomes an emerging biomarker carrier and liquid biopsy tool for preclinical AD. The eye and its associated structures have rich sensory-motor innervation. In this regard, studies have indicated that they may also provide reliable markers. Here, our report covers the current state of knowledge of neuropsychological and eye tests as screening tools for preclinical AD and assesses the value of blood and brain-derived exosomes as carriers of biomarkers in conjunction with the current diagnostic paradigm.
