28217058|a|BACKGROUND: Emergence agitation, vomiting, and oculocardiac reflex (OCR) in children undergoing strabismus surgery under general anesthesia are common problems. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the effect of analgesia can reduce the incidence of these problems. We compared the effects of sub-Tenon's injection versus intravenous (IV) and rectal paracetamol in this surgery. METHODS: In a prospective, randomized, double-blind study, ninety patients ranging in age from 4 to 8 years scheduled for extraocular muscle surgery for strabismus were included in this study. After induction of anesthesia, just before the surgery, children were divided into three groups (n = 30 for each group) Group A received sub-Tenon's anesthesia with 2.5% bupivacaine (0.08 ml/kg). Group B received IV paracetamol (20 mg/kg). Group C received paracetamol rectal suppository (40 mg/kg). The occurrence of oculocardiac reflex (OCR) intraoperatively was recorded. Then, in the Postanesthesia Care Unit, patients were assessed for their emergence behaviors. Vomiting was also noticed. RESULTS: The OCR developed in few patients, and there was no significant difference between the groups. The highest number of patients with agitation was in Group C followed by Group B then Group A. Vomiting was significantly low in Group A followed by Group B then Group C. CONCLUSION: Sub-Tenon block in strabismus surgery in children decreased the incidence of postoperative agitation and vomiting compared with IV paracetamol then rectal paracetamol. There was no difference between sub-Tenon block and paracetamol in the incidence of oculocardiac reflex.
