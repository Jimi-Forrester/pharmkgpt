36265279|t|Discovery of potent indazole-based human glutaminyl cyclase (QC) inhibitors as Anti-Alzheimer's disease agents.
36265279|a|The toxic pyroglutamate form of amyloid-beta (pE-Abeta) is important for the pathogenesis of early Alzheimer's disease (AD); therefore, reducing pE-Abeta by inhibiting glutaminyl cyclase (QC) provides a promising strategy for developing disease-modifying AD drugs. In this study, potent and selective QC inhibitors with desirable drug-like properties were discovered by replacing the 3,4-dimethoxyphenyl group in a QC inhibitor with a bioisosteric indazole surrogate. Among them, 3-methylindazole-6-yl and 3-methylindazole-5-yl derivatives with an N-cyclohexylurea were identified as highly potent inhibitors with IC50 values of 3.2 nM and 2.3 nM, respectively, both of which were approximately 10-fold more potent than varoglutamstat. In addition, the three inhibitors significantly reduced pE-Abeta3-40 levels in an acute animal model after intracerebroventricular (icv) injection and were selective for hQC. Further in vitro pharmacokinetic and toxicity studies, including those investigating cytotoxicity, hERG inhibition, blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability and metabolic stability, indicated that N-(3-methylindazole-6-yl)-N'-(cyclohexyl)urea derivative exhibited the most promising efficacy, selectivity and drug-like profile; thus, it was evaluated for its in vivo efficacy in an AD model.
