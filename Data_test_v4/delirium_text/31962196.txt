31962196|a|OBJECTIVES: The current study was designed to investigate the relationship between the soil arsenic (As) concentration and the mortality from Alzheimer's disease (AD) in mainland China. STUDY DESIGN: Ecological study. METHODS: Twenty-two provinces and 3 municipal districts in mainland China were included in this study. The As concentrations in soil in 1990 was obtained from the China State Environmental Protection Bureau; the data on annual mortality of AD from 1991 to 2000 were obtained from the National Death Cause Surveillance Database of China. Using these data, we calculated the spearman correlation coefficient between soil As concentration and AD mortality, and the relative risk (RR) between soil As levels and AD mortality by quartile-dividing study groups. RESULTS: The spearman correlation coefficient between As concentration and AD mortality was 0.552 (p = 0.004), 0.616 (p = 0.001) and 0.622 (p = 0.001) in the A soil As (eluvial horizon), the C soil As (parent material horizon), and the Total soil As (A soil As + C soil As), respectively. When the A soil As concentration was over 9.05 mg/kg, 10.40 mg/kg and 13.10 mg/kg, the relative risk was 0.835 (95 % CI: 0.832, 0.838), 1.969 (95 %CI: 1.955, 1.982), and 2.939 (95 % CI: 2.920, 2.958), respectively; when the C soil As reached 9.45 mg/kg, 11.10 mg/kg and 13.55 mg/kg, the relative risk was 4.349 (95 % CI: 4.303, 4.396), 6.108 (95 % CI: 6.044, 6.172), and 9.125 (95 %CI: 9.033, 9.219), respectively. No correlation was found between lead, cadmium, and mercury concentration in the soil and AD mortality. CONCLUSION: There was an apparent soil As concentration dependent increase in AD mortality. Results of this study may provide evidence for a possible causal linkage between arsenic exposure and the death risk from AD.
