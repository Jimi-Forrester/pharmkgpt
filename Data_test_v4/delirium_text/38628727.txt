38628727|a|Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia and is characterized by cognitive impairment. The disruption of autophagosome-lysosome function has been linked to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Tris (1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TDCIPP) is a widely used organophosphorus flame retardant that has the potential to cause neuronal damage. We found that TDCIPP significantly increased the expression of beta-site amyloid precursor protein (APP)-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), presenilin-1 (PS1) and Abeta42. Proteomic studies with TMT labeling revealed changes in the profiles of N2a-APPswe cells after exposure to TDCIPP. Proteomic and bioinformatics analyses revealed that lysosomal proteins were dysregulated in N2a-APPswe cells after treatment with TDCIPP. The LC3, P62, CTSD, and LAMP1 levels were increased after TDCIPP exposure, and dysregulated protein expression was validated by Western blotting. The exposure to TDCIPP led to the accumulation of autophagosomes, and this phenomenon was enhanced in the presence of chloroquine (CQ). Our results revealed for the first time that TDCIPP could be a potential environmental risk factor for AD development. The inhibition of autophagosome-lysosome fusion may have a significant impact on the generation of Abeta1-42 in response to TDCIPP.
