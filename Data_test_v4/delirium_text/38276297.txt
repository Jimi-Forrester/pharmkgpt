38276297|t|S100B Secretion in Astrocytes, Unlike C6 Glioma Cells, Is Downregulated by Lactate.
38276297|a|S100B is a calcium-binding protein produced and secreted by astrocytes in response to various extracellular stimuli. C6 glioma cells are a lineage commonly employed for astroglial studies due to the expression of astrocyte specific markers and behavior. However, in high-glucose medium, C6 S100B secretion increases, in contrast to the trend in primary astrocyte cultures. Additionally, S100B secretion decreases due to fluorocitrate (FC), a Krebs cycle inhibitor, highlighting a connection between S100B and metabolism. Herein, we investigate the impact of FC on S100B secretion in primary astrocyte cultures, acute hippocampal slices and C6 glioma cells, as well as lactate mediation. Our results demonstrated that C6 responded similarly to astrocytes in various parameters, despite the decrease in S100B secretion, which was inversely observed in astrocytes and slices. Furthermore, FC inversely altered extracellular lactate in both models, suggesting a role for lactate in S100B secretion. This was reinforced by a decrease in S100B secretion in hippocampal slices treated with lactate and its agonist, but not in C6 cells, despite HCAR1 expression. Our findings indicate that extracellular lactate mediates the decrease in S100B secretion in astrocytes exposed to FC. They also emphasize the differences in C6 glioma cells regarding energetic metabolism. The proposed mechanism via HCAR1 provides further compelling evidence of the relationship between S100B and glucose metabolism.
