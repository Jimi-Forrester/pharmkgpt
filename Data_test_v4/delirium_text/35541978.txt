35541978|t|Detection of resveratrol by phosphorescence quantum dots without conjunction and mutual impact exploration.
35541978|a|In this study, a convenient and sensitive method for the detection of resveratrol was established based on phosphorescence quenching of resveratrol for MPA-capped Mn:ZnS QDs. The quenching intensity was in proportion to the concentration of resveratrol within a certain range. Under optimal conditions, the present assay was valid for detecting resveratrol in the range from 0.03 muM to 14 muM with a detection limit of 0.01 muM. The mechanism of action was also explored, and its application in actual samples was also demonstrated with satisfactory results. This study aims to provide a convenient method for the detection of resveratrol.
