30480228|t|The GABA-Working Memory Relationship in Alzheimer's Disease.
30480228|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a highly debilitating neurodegenerative disease with no cure to date. Emerging evidence indicates aberrations of the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA in the frontal, parietal and temporal cortices, and hippocampal regions of the AD brains. GABA levels have been reported to predict working memory (WM) load capacity in the healthy young population. Since working memory is impaired in AD, it opens an active area of research to investigate the influence of GABA on WM performance in AD. Advancements in neuroimaging techniques and signal processing tools can aid in neurochemical profiling of GABA in AD as well as facilitate in probing the role of GABA in AD-specific impairments of working memory.
