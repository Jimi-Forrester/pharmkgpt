19252697|a|Over the course of the summer of 2006, four adolescent patients were hospitalized because of intentional Datura stramonium (Angel's Trumpet) ingestion. Their records were reviewed for the presence of signs and symptoms of toxicity, clinical course, treatment and outcome. All four patients had a decreased level of consciousness measured by the Glasgow Coma Scale, visual hallucinations, dilated pupils and agitation. The changes in mental status are characteristic of delirium. All four patients were known to abuse substances. The average length of hospitalization was two days. No serious complications were encountered during hospitalization and a full recovery was noted in all patients. The use of sedation and restraints were sufficient treatment modalities. Health care workers should consider anticholinergic plant ingestion as a cause for abrupt onset of delirium.
