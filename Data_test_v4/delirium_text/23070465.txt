23070465|a|Studies of the relationship between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) T/C in intron 2 of the cholesterol-24S-hydroxylase gene (CYP46A1) have reported inconsistent results. To confirm the association between the CYP46A1 T/C polymorphism and AD risk, a meta-analysis containing 4,875 AD cases and 4,874 controls from 21 case-control studies was performed. There were 16 studies involving Europeans, four studies with Asians and one study with Africans. The combined results of overall analysis showed that the CYP46A1 T/C polymorphism increased the risk of AD significantly in recessive model [CC versus CT + TT, odds ratio (OR) = 1.20, 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 1.04-1.38, p = 0.01]. On subgroup analysis by ethnicity, similarly significant differences in recessive model were also found in Europeans. Another analysis of the synergistic effect of the CYP46A1 T/C polymorphism and the epsilon4 allele of the apolipoprotein E gene (APOE epsilon4) was performed in eight studies with available stratified information. The results revealed that the presence of APOE epsilon4 allele could strengthen the effect of CC genotype on AD risk, and the reverse was also true. In conclusion, our meta-analysis has successfully proved that CC genotype of the CYP46A1 T/C polymorphism could increase the risk of AD, and this effect would be weakened in APOE epsilon4 non-carriers and strengthened in APOE epsilon4 carriers.
