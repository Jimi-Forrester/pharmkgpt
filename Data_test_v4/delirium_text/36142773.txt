36142773|a|The development of smart immune evasion mechanisms is crucial for the establishment of acute and chronic viral hepatitis. Hepatitis is a major health problem worldwide arising from different causes, such as pathogens, metabolic disorders, and xenotoxins, with the five hepatitis viruses A, B, C, D, and E (HAV, HBV, HCV, HDV, and HEV) representing the majority of the cases. Most of the hepatitis viruses are considered enveloped. Recently, it was reported that the non-enveloped HAV and HEV are, in reality, quasi-enveloped viruses exploiting exosomal-like biogenesis mechanisms for budding. Regardless, all hepatitis viruses use exosomes to egress, regulate, and eventually escape from the host immune system, revealing another key function of exosomes apart from their recognised role in intercellular communication. This review will discuss how the hepatitis viruses exploit exosome biogenesis and transport capacity to establish successful infection and spread. Then, we will outline the contribution of exosomes in viral persistence and liver disease progression.
