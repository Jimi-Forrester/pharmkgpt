30305304|t|Apolipoprotein E deficiency accelerates atherosclerosis development in miniature pigs.
30305304|a|Miniature pigs have advantages over rodents in modeling atherosclerosis because their cardiovascular system and physiology are similar to that of humans. Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) deficiency has long been implicated in cardiovascular disease in humans. To establish an improved large animal model of familial hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis, the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated protein 9 system (CRISPR/Cas9) was used to disrupt the ApoE gene in Bama miniature pigs. Biallelic-modified ApoE pigs with in-frame mutations (ApoEm/m ) and frameshift mutations (ApoE-/- ) were simultaneously produced. ApoE-/- pigs exhibited moderately increased plasma cholesterol levels when fed with a regular chow diet, but displayed severe hypercholesterolemia and spontaneously developed human-like atherosclerotic lesions in the aorta and coronary arteries after feeding on a high-fat and high-cholesterol (HFHC) diet for 6 months. Thus, these ApoE-/- pigs could be valuable large animal models for providing further insight into translational studies of atherosclerosis.
