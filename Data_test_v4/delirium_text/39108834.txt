39108834|t|The odyssey of the TR(i)P journey to the cellular membrane.
39108834|a|Ion channels are integral membrane proteins mediating ion flow in response to changes in their environment. Among the different types of ion channels reported to date, the super-family of TRP channels stands out since its members have been linked to many pathophysiological processes. The family comprises 6 subfamilies and 28 members in mammals, which are widely distributed throughout most tissues and organs and have an important role in several aspects of cellular physiology. It has been evidenced that abnormal expression, post-translational modifications, and channel trafficking are associated with several pathologies, such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and brain disorders, among others. In this review, we present an updated summary of the mechanisms involved in the subcellular trafficking of TRP channels, with a special emphasis on whether different post-translational modifications and naturally occurring mutagenesis affect both expression and trafficking. Additionally, we describe how such changes have been associated with the development and progress of diverse pathologies associated with the gain or loss of functional phenotypes. The study of these processes will not only contribute to a better understanding the role of TRP channels in the different tissues but will also present novel possible therapeutic targets in diseases where their activity is dysregulated.
