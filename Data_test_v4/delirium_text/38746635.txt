38746635|t|Weakness Thresholds Are Differentially Linked to Cognitive Function by Obesity Status in Older Americans.
38746635|a|Background: Weakness can be operationalized with several thresholds, which in turn, could impact associations with cognitive impairment when considering obesity status. Objective: We examined the associations of absolute, normalized, and collective weakness thresholds on future cognitive impairment by obesity status in older adults. Methods: We performed a secondary data analysis on the 2006-2018 waves of the Health and Retirement Study. A spring-type dynamometer collected handgrip strength (HGS). Males were categorized weak if their HGS was <35.5-kg (absolute), <0.45-kg/kg (body mass normalized), or <1.05-kg/kg/m2 (body mass index (BMI) normalized), while females were defined as weak if their HGS was <20.0-kg, <0.337-kg/kg, or <0.79-kg/kg/m2. The modified Telephone Interview of Cognitive Status examined cognitive function. Persons scoring <=10 had a cognitive impairment. Obesity was categorized as BMI >=30 kg/m2. Results: We included 7,532 and 3,584 persons aged >=65-years living without and with obesity, respectively. Those without obesity but beneath the absolute weakness threshold had 1.54 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.24-1.91) greater odds for future cognitive impairment. Persons with obesity and beneath each threshold also had greater odds for future cognitive impairment: 1.89 (95% CI: 1.28-2.78) for absolute, 2.17 (95% CI: 1.02-4.62) for body mass normalized, and 1.75 (95% CI: 1.10-2.80) for BMI normalized. Older Americans without obesity but underneath all the weakness thresholds had 1.32 (95% CI: 1.00-1.74) greater odds for impairment in cognitive function, while persons with obesity had 2.76 (95% CI: 1.29-5.93) greater odds. Conclusions: There should be consideration for how body size and different weakness thresholds may influence future cognitive outcomes.
