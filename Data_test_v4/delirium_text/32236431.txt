32236431|a|TOPIC: Sleep deprivation in the intensive care unit setting. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The Society of Critical Care Medicine has identified sleep deprivation as a significant contributor to the development of delirium in adult patients in the intensive care unit. Thus, preventing and managing sleep deprivation is important in reducing the incidence of delirium in this patient population. A multifaceted and multidisciplinary approach to promoting sleep in the intensive care unit setting that includes sleep hygiene routines, nursing care plans, and appropriate medication regimens may improve patient outcomes, including reducing delirium. PURPOSE OF ARTICLE: To review the current literature on sleep deprivation in the intensive care unit setting and present care guidelines in a concise format. This information may be helpful in the development of clinical tools and may guide future quality improvement projects aimed at reducing delirium through sleep promotion in critical care patients. CONTENT COVERED: A review of current literature and national organization recommendations revealed consistent themes in addressing the problem of sleep deprivation in the intensive care unit. Modifiable and nonmodifiable risk factors included frequent care interactions, light, noise, medication effects, and preexisting sleep problems.
