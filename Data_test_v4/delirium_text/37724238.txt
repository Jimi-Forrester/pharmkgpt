37724238|t|Fluid Resuscitation in Patients With Traumatic Brain Injury: A Comprehensive Review.
37724238|a|Patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) or head trauma present challenges for emergency physicians and neurosurgeons. Traumatic brain injury is currently a community health issue. For the best possible care, it is crucial to understand the various helpful therapy techniques in the pre-operative and pre-hospital phases. The initial rapid infusion of large volumes of mannitol and a hypertonic crystalloid solution to restore blood pressure and blood volume is the current standard of care for people with combined hemorrhagic shock (HS) and traumatic brain injury. The selection and administration of fluids to trauma and traumatic brain injury patients may be especially helpful in preventing subsequent ischemic brain damage because of the hemodynamic stabilizing effects of these fluids in hypovolemic shock. Traumatic brain injury is an essential factor that may lead to disability and death in a patient. Traumatic brain damage can develop either as a direct result of the trauma or as a result of the initial harm. Significant neurologic problems, such as cranial nerve damage, dementia, seizures, and Alzheimer's disease, can develop after a traumatic brain injury. The comorbidity of the victims may also be significantly increased by additional psychiatric problems such as psychological diseases and other behavioral and cognitive sequels. We review the history of modern fluid therapy, complications after traumatic brain injury, and the use of fluid treatment for decompressive craniectomy and traumatic brain injury.
