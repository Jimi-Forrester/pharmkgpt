37809239|t|Prevalence and Risk Factors of Delirium in Patients Admitted to Intensive Care Units: A Multicentric Cross-Sectional Study.
37809239|a|Background Delirium is a common and serious complication among critically ill patients in the intensive care unit. Knowledge of the risk factors of delirium can help tremendously in the diagnosis of delirium. Methods In April of 2023, a cross-sectional multicenter study was conducted in eight intensive care units (ICUs) across Pakistan. Delirium was assessed using the intensive care delirium screening checklist. Demographic and clinical data were collected, and multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify predictors of delirium. A total of 256 patients were enrolled in the study. Results The mean age of participants was 56 (S.D. 12) years. The point prevalence of delirium was 39%, and the point prevalence did not vary significantly among the participating intensive care units. Advanced age, higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation - IV (APACHE IV) scores, and higher Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) scores at enrollment were identified as significant predictors of delirium. Conclusion The high prevalence of delirium, observed at 39.0%, emphasizes the importance of proactive screening and effective management strategies in the ICU setting. Healthcare providers in Pakistan should be mindful of these risk factors and implement preventive measures to minimize the occurrence of delirium in critically ill patients. Further research and implementation of targeted interventions are warranted to improve patient outcomes and enhance the overall quality of care in this population.
