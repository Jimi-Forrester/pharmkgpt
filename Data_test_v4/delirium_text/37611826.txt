37611826|t|Termination codon readthrough of NNAT mRNA regulates calcium-mediated neuronal differentiation.
37611826|a|Termination codon readthrough (TCR) is a process in which ribosomes continue to translate an mRNA beyond a stop codon generating a C-terminally extended protein isoform. Here, we demonstrate TCR in mammalian NNAT mRNA, which encodes NNAT, a proteolipid important for neuronal differentiation. This is a programmed event driven by cis-acting RNA sequences present immediately upstream and downstream of the canonical stop codon, and is negatively regulated by NONO, an RNA-binding protein known to promote neuronal differentiation. Unlike the canonical isoform NNAT, we determined that the TCR product (NNATx) does not show detectable interaction with the SERCA2 Ca2+ pump, cannot increase cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels, and therefore does not enhance neuronal differentiation in Neuro-2a cells. Additionally, an antisense oligonucleotide that targets a region downstream of the canonical stop codon reduced TCR of NNAT and enhanced the differentiation of Neuro-2a cells to cholinergic neurons. Furthermore, NNATx-deficient Neuro-2a cells, generated using CRISPR-Cas9, showed increased cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels and enhanced neuronal differentiation. Overall, these results demonstrate regulation of neuronal differentiation by TCR of NNAT. Importantly, this process can be modulated using a synthetic antisense oligonucleotide.
