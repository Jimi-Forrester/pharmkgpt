25364135|t|A systematic review of the assessment tools used to measure metamemory in patients with brain injury.
25364135|a|[Purpose] The purpose of this study was to provide various assessment tools for metamemory of a patient with brain injury to develop accurate metamemory measurement methods which can be effectively applied in rehabilitation training programs in clinics. [Subjects and Methods] For this study, we carried out a systematic document search of the literature for articles published between January, 2001, and December, 2013, in order to review studies of measurement tools used to assess the metamemory of patients with brain injury. [Results] The initial search of the databases yielded 57 articles, 48 of which did not meet the inclusion criteria. Thus 9 studies were included in our review. The quality level of all the studies was IIA2b and PEDro scale scores were found to range from 4 to 6. [Conclusion] More studies need to be made, using various measurement tools for metamemory of more diverse patient groups. We believe studies should be made of the assessment of metamemory and interventions for it in accordance with the diagnoses and the cognitive levels of the patients with brain injury.
