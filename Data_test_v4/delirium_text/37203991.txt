37203991|t|Acrolein: formation, health hazards and its controlling by dietary polyphenols.
37203991|a|Acrolein, a highly reactive toxic aldehyde, is a common dietary and environmental contaminant which can also be generated endogenously. Exposure to acrolein has been positively associated with some pathological conditions, such as atherosclerosis, diabetes mellitus, stroke, and Alzheimer's disease. At the cellular level, acrolein induces various harmful effects, particularly protein adduction and oxidative damages. Polyphenols are a group of secondary plant metabolites ubiquitously presented in fruits, vegetables, and herbs. Recent evidence has gradually solidified the protective role of polyphenols by working as acrolein scavengers and regulator of acrolein toxicities. This was largely attributed to the ability of polyphenols as antioxidants and sacrificial nucleophiles in trapping acrolein. This review discussed the exposure and toxicity of acrolein, summarized the known and anticipated contribution of polyphenols in ameliorating acrolein contamination and its health hazards.
