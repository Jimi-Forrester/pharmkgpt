39288245|a|INTRODUCTION: Minimal Invasive Extracorporeal Circulation (MiECC) has recently emerged as a more 'physiologic' alternative to conventional extracorporeal circulation. However, its adoption is still limited due to lack of robust scientific evidence and ongoing debate about its potential benefits. This bibliometric analysis aims to analyze the scientific articles on MiECC and identify current research domains and existing gaps to be addressed in future studies. METHODS: Pertinent articles were retrieved from the Web of Science (WOS) database. The search string included 'minimal invasive extracorporeal circulation' and its synonyms. The VOSviewer (version 1.6.17) software was used to conduct comprehensive analyses. Semantic and research networks, bibliographic coupling and journal analysis were performed. RESULTS: Of the 1777 articles identified in WOS, 292 were retrieved. The trend in publications increased from 1991 to date. Most articles focused on transfusion requirements, acute kidney injury, inflammatory markers and cytokines, inflammation and delirium, though the impact of intraoperative optimal fluid and hemodynamic management as far as the occurrence of postoperative complications were poorly addressed. The semantic network analysis found inter-connections between the terms "cardiopulmonary bypass", "inflammatory response", and "cardiac surgery". Perfusion contributed the highest number of published documents. The most extensive research partnerships were between Germany, Greece, Italy, and England. CONCLUSIONS: Notwithstanding the scientific community's growing interest in MiECC, crucial topics (i.e., the best anesthetic management and intraoperative need for inotropes, vasopressors and fluids) still require more comprehensive exploration. This investigation may prove to be a useful tool for clinicians, scientists, and students concerning global publication output and for the use of MiECC in cardiac surgery.
