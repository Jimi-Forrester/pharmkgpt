35683364|a|This study investigated the relationship between grey matter (GM) volume and blood biomarkers, blood pressure, and obesity. We aimed to elucidate lifestyle factors that promote GM volume loss. A total of 1799 participants underwent the brain dock as a medical checkup. Data regarding blood pressure, obesity measurements, and standard blood biomarkers were obtained. Further, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), including high-resolution T1-weighted imaging, was performed. We calculated the grey matter brain healthcare quotient (GM-BHQ), which represents GM volume as a deviation value. After adjusting for confounding variables, multiple regression analysis revealed that body mass index (BMI) (b = -0.28, p < 0.001), gamma-glutamyltransferase (gamma-GTP) (b = -0.01, p = 0.16), and fasting blood glucose (b = -0.02, p = 0.049) were significantly correlated with GM-BHQ. Although the current cross-sectional study cannot determine a cause-and-effect relationship, elevated BMI, gamma-GTP, and fasting blood glucose could promote GM volume loss.
