19670557|t|Risk factors predicting later functional decline in older hospitalized patients.
19670557|a|With the demographic and epidemiological changes, an increasing number of older subjects are admitted to hospital. These patients are at increased risk of adverse health outcomes, including functional decline, increased length of stay, institutionalization, geriatric syndromes (e.g. delirium), hospital readmissions and death. Age, basic demographic data, diagnosis and comorbidities are not sufficient to estimate the risk of a further negative evolution of the frail older patient during and after hospitalization. As functional decline begins soon after admission, it is important to screen vulnerable patients early in order to plan appropriate orientation to geriatric programmes and to target interventions.This narrative review analyses which appropriate parameters, available soon after admission, may help to identify the older patients at risk of functional decline and to stratify their risk. Functional decline was defined here as loss of independence in basic care or admission in nursing home. The main risk factors identified by this analysis are functional status before or at admission, cognitive performance and social characteristics.These data may be easily and quickly collected by the nursing staff on admission, and further assessed by the geriatric liaison team, in order to optimize care management in frail older patients.
