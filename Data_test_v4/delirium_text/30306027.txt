30306027|t|Aortic Valve Thrombosis after Valve-Sparing Aortic Root Replacement and Insertion of an Extracorporeal Left Ventricular Assist Device, Masked by Mediastinal Packing.
30306027|a|Aortic valve (AV) or aortic root thrombus related to a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) is a relatively uncommon but potentially life-threatening complication. In the present report, we describe a complex case where echocardiographic diagnosis of AV thrombosis was obscured by the presence of mediastinal packing in a patient who underwent valve-sparing aortic root replacement and insertion of the CentriMag  LVAD for postcardiotomy cardiogenic shock. A large AV thrombus may develop rapidly in patients with LVADs. This case highlights the importance of a careful and thorough transesophageal echocardiography examination in detecting this complication and in altering surgical management.
