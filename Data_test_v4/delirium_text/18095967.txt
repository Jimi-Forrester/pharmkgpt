18095967|a|BACKGROUND: Emergence agitation (EA) is a postoperative behavior that may occur in children undergoing general anesthesia with inhaled agents. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to assess the effect of propofol administered at the end of sevoflurane anesthesia on the incidence and severity of EA in children undergoing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). METHODS: Eighty-four children, 2-7 years old, undergoing MRI were enrolled in this randomized double-blind study. No sedative premedication was administered prior to anesthesia induction. Anesthesia was induced and maintained with sevoflurane in N(2)O/O(2). Group P received propofol 1 mg.kg(-1) and group S received saline. Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium scale (PAEDs) was used to evaluate recovery characteristics upon awakening and during the first 30 min after emergence from anesthesia. Children with PAEDs >16 were considered agitated. EA was analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U-test. Demographic data and other side effects were analyzed using the Student's t-test. RESULTS: Eighty-three children completed the study. There were 42 children in group P. EA was diagnosed in two children in the propofol group (4.8%) and in 11 children in the placebo group (26.8%, P < 0.05). Time to achieving postanesthesia care unit discharge criteria was not different between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of propofol 1 mg.kg(-1) can significantly decrease the incidence of EA after sevoflurane general anesthesia in children undergoing nonpainful procedures.
