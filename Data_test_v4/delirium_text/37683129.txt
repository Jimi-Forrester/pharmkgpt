37683129|a|Alzheimer's disease is a most prevalent form of dementia all around the globe and currently poses a significant challenge to the healthcare system. Currently available drugs only slow the progression of this disease rather than provide proper containment. Identification of multiple targets responsible for this disease in the last three decades established it as a multifactorial neurodegenerative disorder that needs novel multifunctional agents for its management and the possible reason for the failure of currently available single target clinical drugs. 1,2,3-Triazole is a miraculous nucleus in medicinal chemistry and the first choice for development of multifunctional hybrid molecules. Apart from that, it is an integral component of various drugs in clinical trials as well as in clinical practice. This review is focused on the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease and 1,2,3-triazole containing derivatives developed in recent decades as potential anti-Alzheimer's agents. The review will provide (A) precise insight of various established targets of Alzheimer's disease including cholinergic, amyloid, tau, monoamine oxidases, glutamate, calcium, and reactive oxygen species hypothesis and (B) design hypothesis, structure-activity relationships, and pharmacological outcomes of 1,2,3-triazole containing multifunctional anti-Alzheimer's agents. This review will provide a baseline for various research groups working on Alzheimer's drug development in designing potent, safer, and effective multifunctional anti-Alzheimer's candidates of the future.
