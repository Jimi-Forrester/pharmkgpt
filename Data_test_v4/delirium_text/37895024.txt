37895024|t|"Alphabet" Selenoproteins: Implications in Pathology.
37895024|a|Selenoproteins are a group of proteins containing selenium in the form of selenocysteine (Sec, U) as the 21st amino acid coded in the genetic code. Their synthesis depends on dietary selenium uptake and a common set of cofactors. Selenoproteins accomplish diverse roles in the body and cell processes by acting, for example, as antioxidants, modulators of the immune function, and detoxification agents for heavy metals, other xenobiotics, and key compounds in thyroid hormone metabolism. Although the functions of all this protein family are still unknown, several disorders in their structure, activity, or expression have been described by researchers. They concluded that selenium or cofactors deficiency, on the one hand, or the polymorphism in selenoproteins genes and synthesis, on the other hand, are involved in a large variety of pathological conditions, including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular, muscular, oncological, hepatic, endocrine, immuno-inflammatory, and neurodegenerative diseases. This review focuses on the specific roles of selenoproteins named after letters of the alphabet in medicine, which are less known than the rest, regarding their implications in the pathological processes of several prevalent diseases and disease prevention.
