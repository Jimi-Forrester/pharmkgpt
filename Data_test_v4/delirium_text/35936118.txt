35936118|t|Comparative Study of Intranasal Dexmedetomidine Versus Intranasal Ketamine as Premedicant in Children.
35936118|a|BACKGROUND:  Pre-operative anxiety in children not only makes induction difficult but it is also associated with an increase in the requirement of analgesics, the incidence of post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV), emergence delirium (ED), and postoperative maladaptive behavioral changes. It can be reduced effectively by pharmacological interventions. In a quest to find the ideal premedicant and non-invasive way of its administration, we decided to compare intranasal (IN) dexmedetomidine with IN ketamine as a premedicant in pediatric patients. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES:  To compare sedation score, mask acceptance score (MAS) during induction, the incidence of ED, and other adverse events in both groups. MATERIAL AND METHODS:  Some 60 children, between 1 and 8 years of age of either sex undergoing surgical procedures were included in this study and randomly divided into two groups (Group D and Group K). Thirty minutes prior to induction of anesthesia, patients of Group D received dexmedetomidine 1 mcg kg-1 in 1 mL of 0.9% saline intranasally and patients of Group K received ketamine 5 mg kg-1 in 1 mL of 0.9% saline intranasally through calibrated dropper (0.5 mL in each nostril) in a recumbent position. Incidences of sneezing or coughing after IN administration of study drugs were recorded. The subsequent sedation scores were assessed using MOASS at 15 min, then at 30 min following premedication at the time of parental separation. After shifting patients to operation theater inhalation induction was done. MAS at induction and any adverse effects were recorded. RESULTS:  Children in Group K were found to be significantly more sedated at 30 min after administration of premedication and mask acceptance was also better (p value < 0.0001 with a confidence interval, CI=95%). But the incidence of ED and PONV was high. CONCLUSION:  Intranasal dexmedetomidine (1 mcg kg-1) is clinically less effective as a premedicant in terms of sedation and mask acceptance in older children as compared to ketamine (5 mg kg-1), but associated with fewer incidence of ED and PONV. We recommend the usage of IN dexmedetomidine in a higher dose (1.5-2 mcg kg-1), through nebulization/atomizer for the desired level of sedation and mask acceptance.
