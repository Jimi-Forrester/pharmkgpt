36330912|a|As the most common neurodegenerative disease, Alzheimer's disease (AD) exhibits an incomprehensible pathogenesis, which has led to the continuous failure of drug development in recent years. Although neuronal damage is considered a pathological feature of AD, treatment strategies targeting beta-amyloid (Abeta) have not achieved beneficial effects. In-depth research on glial cells has revealed the strong importance and application prospects of astrocytes in the recovery of cognitive functions. This review summarizes the role of astrocytes in AD and the possibility of therapeutic strategies targeting astrocytes. Astrocytes are involved in brain lipid metabolism and can regulate the synthesis and degradation of Abeta to affect the pathology of AD. The tau protein is phosphorylated by astrocytes, and this phosphorylation leads to the formation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Astrocytes can express a variety of receptors and inflammatory factors and participate in the neuroinflammatory process and the release of proinflammatory mediators. When the glutamate produced by the neurons is not cleared by astrocytes, neurons undergo apoptosis due to blocked cell metabolism. Therapies for astrocytes are highly efficient, and these include stem cell therapy, gene editing technology, astrocyte transformation and chemical drugs. Here, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of animal and cell models applied to the study of targeted astrocyte therapies. This study helps elucidate the mechanism of astrocytes in AD and promotes the clinical application of potential therapeutic strategies targeting astrocytes.
