35831895|t|A functional reference map of the RNF8 interactome in cancer.
35831895|a|BACKGROUND: RNF8 is an E3 ligase identified as a critical DNA damage-responsive protein. Recently, multiple reports have shown that RNF8 could be used as an important therapeutic target for cancer chemo/radiotherapy. However, the understanding of RNF8 remains limited due to the lack of its interactome reference map and comprehensive analysis of RNF8 in diverse cancers, which underscores the need to map the interactome of RNF8 via high-throughput methods. RESULTS: A two-way identification method based on LC-MS was designed for the identification of the RNF8 interactome with high-specificity. By in silico analysis and in vitro validation, we identified a new reference map of the RNF8 interactome network containing many new targets, such as YBX1, DNMT1, and HDCA1, new biological functions and the gene-disease associations of RNF8. Our results revealed a close relationship between RNF8 and neurodegenerative diseases or tumor-infiltrating immune cells using bulk RNA-seq and scRNA-seq datasets. As a proof of concept of our interactome map, we validated the direct binding between RNF8 and YBX1 and showed that RNF8 catalyzed the ubiquitination of YBX1. These results demonstrated that RNF8 might be a crucial regulator of YBX1. CONCLUSIONS: Our work provides a unique framework for researchers and clinicians who seek to better explore or understand RNF8-regulated biological functions in cancers. This study will hopefully facilitate the rational design and further development of anti-RNF8 therapy in cancers.
