31770112|a|The clinical use of opioid analgesics, such as morphine, is limited by analgesic tolerance, molecular mechanism of which is not well understood. Recently, molecular chaperone heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) has been demonstrated to play important roles in morphine-induced neuroadaptation. Here, we focused on the involvement of Hsp70 in the development of analgesic tolerance to morphine. Rats were treated with morphine (5, 10, 20 mg/kg, subcutaneously) or saline once daily for 10 consecutive days. Hsp70 modulator N-formyl-3, 4-methylenedioxybenzylidine-gamma-butyrolactam [KNK437, 100 mg/kg, intraperitoneally (i.p.)], geranylgeranylacetone (500 mg/kg, i.p.) or pifithrin-mu (20 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered before morphine (10 mg/kg, subcutaneously)/saline treatment. Analgesic effect of morphine was measured using the tail-flick latency test, and Hsp70 protein expression was examined by western blot. Analgesic effect of morphine decreased gradually with the increase in the number of days of morphine injection, indicating development of analgesic tolerance. A significant increase of Hsp70 expression in the periaqueductal gray was observed during the development of analgesic tolerance after repeated morphine injections. The development of morphine analgesic tolerance was suppressed by pre-treatment with Hsp70 transcriptional inhibitor KNK437 or functional antagonist pifithrin-mu, while promoted by pre-treatment with Hsp70 transcriptional inducer geranylgeranylacetone. Our results demonstrated that the development of morphine analgesic tolerance was dual regulated by Hsp70 modulators, suggesting Hsp70 as an interesting and new target for preventing the development of opioid analgesic tolerance.
