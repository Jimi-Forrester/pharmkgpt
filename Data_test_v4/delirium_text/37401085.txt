37401085|t|Complication Rates and Utilization Trends of 3-Level Posterior Column Osteotomy Compared to Single-Level Pedicle Subtraction Osteotomy.
37401085|a|OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to assess differences in complication profiles between 3-level posterior column osteotomy (PCO) and single-level pedicle subtraction osteotomy (PSO) as both are reported to provide similar degrees of sagittal correction. METHODS: The PearlDiver database was queried retrospectively using International Classification of Disease, 9th and 10th edition and Current Procedural Terminology codes to identify patients who underwent PCO or PSO for degenerative spine disease. Patients under age 18 or with history of spinal malignancy, infection, or trauma were excluded. Patients were separated into 2 cohorts, 3-level PCO or single-level PSO, matched at a 1:1 ratio based on age, sex, Elixhauser comorbidity index, and number of fused posterior segments. Thirtyday systemic and procedure-related complications were compared. RESULTS: Matching resulted in 631 patients for each cohort. PCO patients had decreased odds of respiratory (odds ratio [OR], 0.58; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.43-0.82; p = 0.001) and renal complications (OR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.40-0.88; p = 0.009) compared to PSO patients. There was no significant difference in cardiac complications, sepsis, pressure ulcer, dural tear, delirium, neurologic injuries, postoperative hematoma, postoperative anemia, or overall complications. CONCLUSION: Patients who undergo 3-level PCO have decreased respiratory and renal complications compared to single-level PSO. No differences were found in the other complications studied. Considering both procedures achieve similar sagittal correction, surgeons should be aware that 3-level PCO offers an improved safety profile compared to single-level PSO.
