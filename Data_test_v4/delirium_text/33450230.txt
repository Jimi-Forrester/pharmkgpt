33450230|a|Production of amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) is carried out by the membrane-embedded gamma-secretase complex. Mutations in the transmembrane domain of amyloid beta-protein precursor (APP) associated with early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) can alter the ratio of aggregation-prone 42-residue Abeta (Abeta42) to 40-residue Abeta (Abeta40). However, APP substrate is proteolyzed processively by gamma-secretase along two pathways: Abeta49 Abeta46 Abeta43 Abeta40 and Abeta48 Abeta45 Abeta42 Abeta38. Effects of FAD mutations on each proteolytic step are unknown, largely due to difficulties in detecting and quantifying longer Abeta peptides. To address this, we carried out systematic and quantitative analyses of all tri- and tetrapeptide coproducts from proteolysis of wild-type and 14 FAD-mutant APP substrates by purified gamma-secretase. These small peptides, including FAD-mutant forms, were detected by tandem mass spectrometry and quantified by establishing concentration curves for each of 32 standards. APP intracellular domain (AICD) coproducts were quantified by immunoblot, and the ratio of AICD products corresponding to Abeta48 and Abeta49 was determined by mass spectrometry. Levels of individual Abeta peptides were determined by subtracting levels of peptide coproducts associated with degradation from those associated with production. This method was validated for Abeta40 and Abeta42 by specific ELISAs and production of equimolar levels of Abeta and AICD. Not all mutant substrates led to increased Abeta42/40. However, all 14 disease-causing mutations led to inefficient processing of longer forms of Abeta >= 45 residues. In addition, the effects of certain mutations provided insight into the mechanism of processive proteolysis: intermediate Abeta peptides apparently remain bound for subsequent trimming and are not released and reassociated.
