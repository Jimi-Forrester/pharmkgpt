15615632|a|Intracellular assembly of microtubule-associated protein tau into filamentous inclusions is central to Alzheimer's disease and related disorders collectively known as tauopathies. Although tau mutations, posttranslational modifications and degradations have been the focus of investigations, the mechanism of tau fibrillogenesis in vivo still remains elusive. Different strategies have been undertaken to generate animal and cellular models for tauopathies. Some are used to study the molecular events leading to the assembly and accumulation of tau filaments, and others to identify potential therapeutic agents that are capable of impeding tauopathy. This review highlights the latest developments in new models and how their utility improves our understanding of the sequence of events leading to human tauopathy.
