33724783|t|Probing the Structure of Toxic Amyloid-beta Oligomers with Electron Spin Resonance and Molecular Modeling.
33724783|a|Structural models of the toxic species involved in the development of Alzheimer's disease are of utmost importance to understand the molecular mechanism and to describe early biomarkers of the disease. Among toxic species, soluble oligomers of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides are particularly important, because they are responsible for spreading cell damages over brain regions, thus rapidly impairing brain functions. In this work we obtain structural information on a carefully prepared Abeta(1-42) sample, representing a toxic state for cell cultures, by combining electron spin resonance spectroscopy and computational models. We exploited the binding of Cu2+ to Abeta(1-42) and used copper as a probe for estimating Cu-Cu distances in the oligomers by applying double electron-electron resonance (DEER) pulse sequence. The DEER trace of this sample displays a unique feature that fits well with structural models of oligomers formed by Cu-cross-linked peptide dimers. Because Cu is bound to the Abeta(1-42) N-terminus, for the first time structural constraints that are missing in reported studies are provided at physiological conditions for the Abeta N-termini. These constraints suggest the Abeta(1-42) dimer as the building block of soluble oligomers, thus changing the scenario for any kinetic model of Abeta(1-42) aggregation.
