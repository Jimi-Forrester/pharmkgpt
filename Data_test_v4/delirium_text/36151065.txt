36151065|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Subtle cognitive decline represents a stage of cognitive deterioration in which pathological biomarkers may be present, including early cortical atrophy and amyloid deposition. Using individual items from the Montreal Cognitive Assessment and k-modes cluster analysis, we previously identified three clusters of individuals without overt cognitive impairment: (1) High Performing (no deficits in performance), (2) Memory Deficits (lower memory performance), and (3) Compound Deficits (lower memory and executive function performance). In this study, we sought to understand the relationships found in our clusters between cortical atrophy on MR and amyloid burden on PET. METHODS: Data were derived from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative and comprised individuals from our previous analyses with available MR and amyloid PET scans (n = 272). Using multiple-group structural equation modeling, we regressed amyloid standardized uptake value ratio on volumetric regions to simultaneously evaluate unique associations within each cluster. RESULTS: In our Compound Deficits cluster, greater whole cerebral amyloid burden was significantly related to right entorhinal cortical and left hippocampal atrophy, rs  = -.412 (p = .005) and -.304 (p = .049), respectively. Within this cluster, right entorhinal cortical atrophy was significantly related to greater amyloid burden within multiple frontal regions. CONCLUSIONS: The Compound Deficits cluster, which represents a group potentially at higher risk for decline, was observed to have significantly more cortical atrophy, particularly within the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus, associated with whole brain and frontal lobe amyloid burden. These findings point to a pattern of early pathological deterioration that may place these individuals at risk for future decline.
