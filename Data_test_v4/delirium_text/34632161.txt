34632161|a|BACKGROUND: The aim of this study is to develop and validate a scoring system as a tool for predicting the in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients in early stage of disease. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study, conducted on 893 COVID-19 patients in Tehran from February 18 to July 20, 2020. Potential factors were chosen via stepwise selection and multivariable logistic regression model. Cross-validation method was employed to assess the predictive performance of the model as well as the scoring system such as discrimination, calibration, and validity indices. RESULTS: The COVID-19 patients' median age was 63 yrs (54.98% male) and 233 (26.09%) patients expired during the study. The scoring system was developed based on 8 selected variables: age >=55 yrs (OR = 5.67, 95% CI: 3.25-9.91), males (OR = 1.51, 95% CI: 1.007-2.29), ICU need (OR = 16.32, 95% CI 10.13-26.28), pulse rate >90 (OR = 1.89, 95% CI: 1.26-2.83), lymphocytes <17% (OR = 2.33, 95%CI: 1.54-3.50), RBC <=4, 10 6/L (OR = 2.10, 95% CI: 1.35-3.26), LDH >700 U/L (OR = 1.68, 95%CI: 1.13-2.51) and troponin I level >0.03 ng/mL (OR = 1.75, 95%CI: 1.17-2.62). The AUC and the accuracy of scoring system after cross-validation were 79.4% and 79.89%, respectively. CONCLUSION: This study showed that developed scoring system has a good performance and can use to help physicians for identifying high-risk patients in early stage of disease .
