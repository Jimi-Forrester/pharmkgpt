35311655|a|OBJECTIVES: To describe a perioperative cross-speciality geriatrics program for patients aged >80 years with colorectal cancer (CRC), aimed to detect and manage frailty and to understand its influence on clinical outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients aged >80 years with CRC and proposed for surgery were included from October 2018 to March 2020. Comprehensive geriatric assessments (CGA) were performed. Patients were classified according to the estimated physiological reserve, from fit, frail patients and even the disabled: CGA-1, CGA-2, CGA-3, and CGA-4. Individualised treatment was adapted to each patient's situation. Patients who underwent surgery were followed up by a geriatrician. The presence of complications, length of stay, hospital readmissions at 30 days, and short- and long-term mortality were recorded. RESULTS: Seventy-four patients were included. The mean age was 84.5 +- 4.5 years. 55.4% patients were classified as CGA-1, 24.3% as CGA-2, 16.2% as CGA-3, and 4.1% as CGA-4. No CGA-4 patient was operated on. Frail (CGA-2 and CGA-3) patients had higher medical complications (50% vs 21.2%, p < 0.05) and delirium (30% vs 9.1%, p < 0.05) than fit patients (CGA-1). They also had higher rates of surgical complications (20% vs 15.2%), longer hospital stay (10 +- 6.2 vs 8.4 +- 4.2 days), 30-day readmissions (15% vs 6.3%), and mortality at six (10% vs 3%) and twelve months (20% vs 6.1%), although it was not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: CGA and prehabilitation can classify patients according to their frailty status, support clinicians in decision-making to achieve tailored treatment, and detect clinical conditions for intervention in multiple domains of health in the perioperative period.
