33841001|a|The treatments of nervous system diseases (NSDs) have long been difficult issues for researchers because of their complexity of pathogenesis. With the advent of aging society, searching for effective treatments of NSDs has become a hot topic. Ginseng polysaccharides (GP), as the main biologically active substance in ginseng, has various biological properties in immune-regulation, anti-oxidant, anti-inflammation and etc. Considering the association between the effects of GP and the pathogenesis of neurological disorders, many related experiments have been conducted in recent years. In this paper, we reviewed previous studies about the effects and mechanisms of GP on diseases related to nervous system. We found GP play an ameliorative role on NSDs through the regulation of immune system, inflammatory response, oxidative damage and signaling pathway. Structure-activity relationship was also discussed and summarized. In addition, we provided new insights into GP as promising neuroprotective agent for its further development and utilization.
