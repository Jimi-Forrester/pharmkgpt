38811924|t|A retrospective analysis of the incidence and risk factors of perioperative urinary tract infections after total hysterectomy.
38811924|a|INTRODUCTION: Perioperative urinary tract infections (PUTIs) are common in the United States and are a significant contributor to high healthcare costs. There is a lack of large studies on the risk factors for PUTIs after total hysterectomy (TH). METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study using a national inpatient sample (NIS) of 445,380 patients from 2010 to 2019 to analyze the risk factors and annual incidence of PUTIs associated with TH perioperatively. RESULTS: PUTIs were found in 9087 patients overall, showing a 2.0% incidence. There were substantial differences in the incidence of PUTIs based on age group (P < 0.001). Between the two groups, there was consistently a significant difference in the type of insurance, hospital location, hospital bed size, and hospital type (P < 0.001). Patients with PUTIs exhibited a significantly higher number of comorbidities (P < 0.001). Unsurprisingly, patients with PUTIs had a longer median length of stay (5 days vs. 2 days; P < 0.001) and a higher in-hospital death rate (from 0.1 to 1.1%; P < 0.001). Thus, the overall hospitalization expenditures increased by $27,500 in the median ($60,426 vs. $32,926, P < 0.001) as PUTIs increased medical costs. Elective hospitalizations are less common in patients with PUTIs (66.8% vs. 87.6%; P < 0.001). According to multivariate logistic regression study, the following were risk variables for PUTIs following TH: over 45 years old; number of comorbidities (>= 1); bed size of hospital (medium, large); teaching hospital; region of hospital(south, west); preoperative comorbidities (alcohol abuse, deficiency anemia, chronic blood loss anemia, congestive heart failure, diabetes, drug abuse, hypertension, hypothyroidism, lymphoma, fluid and electrolyte disorders, metastatic cancer, other neurological disorders, paralysis, peripheral vascular disorders, psychoses, pulmonary circulation disorders, renal failure, solid tumor without metastasis, valvular disease, weight loss); and complications (sepsis, acute myocardial infarction, deep vein thrombosis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, pneumonia, stroke, wound infection, wound rupture, hemorrhage, pulmonary embolism, blood transfusion, postoperative delirium). CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that identifying these risk factors can lead to improved preventive strategies and management of PUTIs in TH patients. Counseling should be done prior to surgery to reduce the incidence of PUTIs. THE MANUSCRIPT ADDS TO CURRENT KNOWLEDGE: In medical practice, the identification of risk factors can lead to improved patient prevention and treatment strategies. We conducted a retrospective study using a national inpatient sample (NIS) of 445,380 patients from 2010 to 2019 to analyze the risk factors and annual incidence of PUTIs associated with TH perioperatively. PUTIs were found in 9087 patients overall, showing a 2.0% incidence. We found that noted increased length of hospital stay, medical cost, number of pre-existing comorbidities, size of the hospital, teaching hospitals, and region to also a play a role in the risk of UTI's.
