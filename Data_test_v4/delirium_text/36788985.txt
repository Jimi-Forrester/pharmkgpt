36788985|t|Co-infection associated with SARS-CoV-2 and their management.
36788985|a|SARS-CoV-2 was discovered in Wuhan, China and quickly spread throughout the world. This deadly virus moved from person to person, resulting in severe pneumonia, fever, chills and hypoxia. Patients are still experiencing problems after recovering from COVID-19. This review covers COVID-19 and associated issues following recovery from COVID-19, as well as multiorgan damage risk factors and treatment techniques. Several unusual illnesses, including mucormycosis, white fungus infection, happy hypoxia and other systemic abnormalities, have been reported in recovered individuals. In children, multisystem inflammatory syndrome with COVID-19 (MIS-C) is identified. The reasons for this might include uncontrollable steroid usage, reduced immunity, uncontrollable diabetes mellitus and inadequate care following COVID-19 recovery.
