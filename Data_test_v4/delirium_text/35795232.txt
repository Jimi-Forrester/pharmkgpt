35795232|t|Behavioral Reserve in Behavioral Variant Frontotemporal Dementia.
35795232|a|"Reserve" refers to the individual clinical differences in response to a neuropathological burden. We explored the behavioral reserve (BR) and associated neural substrates in 40 participants with behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) who were assessed with the frontal behavioral inventory (FBI) and magnetic resonance imaging. Because neuroimaging abnormality showed a high negative correlation with the FBI negative (but not positive) symptom scores, we developed a linear model only to calculate the nBR (BR for negative symptoms) marker using neuroimaging abnormalities and the FBI score. Participants were divided into high nBR and low nBR groups based on the nBR marker. The FBI negative symptom score was lower in the high nBR group than in the low nBR group having the same neuroimaging abnormalities. However, the high nBR group noted a steeper decline in cortical atrophy and showed less atrophy in the left frontotemporal cortices than the low nBR group. In addition, the fractional anisotropy (FA) values were greater in the high nBR than in the low nBR group, except in the sensory-motor and occipital areas. We identified an nBR-related functional network composed of bilateral frontotemporal areas and the left occipital pole. We propose the concept of BR in bvFTD, and these findings can help predict the disease progression.
