16934009|a|OBJECTIVE: To review diagnoses and challenges of treating patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), commonly considered the second most common form of dementia. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, Web of Science, and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts databases were searched in January 2006 for clinical studies, case series, case studies, letters, and review articles on the treatment of DLB. Search terms included: aripiprazole, cholinesterase inhibitors, clozapine, dementia with Lewy bodies, donepezil, galantamine, Lewy body dementia, neuroleptics, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, rivastigmine, tacrine, ziprasidone. Applicable articles in the English language were reviewed. The bibliographies of these articles provided additional references. STUDY SELECTION: Articles describing studies, case series, and case studies are included in this review. DATA SYNTHESIS: DLB is commonly considered the second most common form of dementia, although some experts believe vascular dementia to be the second most common form. DLB is often under-diagnosed and misdiagnosed as Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's related dementia. The core features of dementia with Lewy bodies are cognitive decline plus at least one of the following: fluctuations in cognition, visual hallucinations, and parkinsonism. Other supportive features include: neuroleptic sensitivity, repeated falls, syncope, transient loss of consciousness, REM sleep disturbances, depression, delusions, and nonvisual hallucinations. CONCLUSION: Increased prudence with the use of neuroleptic agents is essential in DLBs because the use of these agents is associated with physical and cognitive decline and increased mortality. While neuroleptic sensitivity has been reported with the use of both typical and atypical antipsychotic medications, these medications are often necessary for the treatment of psychotic symptoms. Decreases in neuroleptic sensitivity can often be achieved by dose reductions, although neuroleptic discontinuation is sometimes necessary. Cholinesterase inhibitors may be especially useful in the treatment of DLB. Cholinergic deficits are associated with visual hallucinations, and cholinesterase inhibitors often result in resolution of hallucinations, improved cognition, and decreased behavioral disturbances.
