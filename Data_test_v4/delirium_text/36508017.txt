36508017|a|Pharmacological management of bone health warrants investigation into factors influencing initiation of bone protection medication (BPM) at discharge after a hip fracture. This sprint audit identified reasons attributed to low BPM treatment levels at hospital discharge which can guide improvement in the prevention of future fractures. PURPOSE: To compare patient characteristics and Australian and New Zealand approaches to prescribing bone protection medication (BPM) pre- or post-hip fracture, determine reasons why BPM was not prescribed earlier post-fracture, and assess the generalisability of sprint audit and the Australian and New Zealand Hip Fracture Registry (ANZHFR) patient cohorts. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of hip fracture patients from the ANZHFR aged >= 50 years (2016-2020) and consecutive patients from the 2021 BPM sprint audit. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine factors associated with not prescribing BPM. RESULTS: Of 55,618 patients admitted with a hip fracture in the ANZHFR, less than 10% of patients in Australia and New Zealand were taking BPM on admission, increasing to 22.4% in Australia and 27.8% in New Zealand on discharge. Registry patients who were younger (50-69 years), healthy (ASA grade 1), lived in a residential aged care facility, had impaired cognition, delirium identified, or were awaiting a specialist falls assessment were less likely to take BPM. Within the audit, 46.2% of patients in Australia and 39.2% in New Zealand did not have BPM in their discharge prescription. The most common reason for not prescribing BPM in Australia was low level of vitamin D (13.3%), and in New Zealand, renal impairment (14.8%). Sprint and registry patient characteristics were comparable in terms of patient age, sex, usual place of residence, and ASA grade. CONCLUSIONS: BPM prescription early after hip fracture is low. Opportunities exist to increase the rate of prescription of medications known to prevent future fractures in this high-risk population.
