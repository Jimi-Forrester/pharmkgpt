28649607|a|Recent findings of morphological and functional changes in Parkinson's disease brains have shown altered synapse formation, but their role in cognitive decline is still an area under exploration. Here we measured the concentration of three key synaptic proteins, Rab3A, SNAP25 and neurogranin by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, in cerebrospinal fluid from a total of 139 participants (87 controls and 52 Parkinson's disease patients out of which 30 were drug-naive) and explored their associations with motor and cognitive symptoms. Associations with motor disease stage (assessed by Hoehn and Yahr scale) and cognitive performance (assessed by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores) were explored. An overall increase in the concentration of SNAP25 was found in Parkinson's disease patients (p = 0.032). Increased neurogranin levels were found in the drug naive patients subgroup (p = 0.023). Significant associations were observed between increased concentration of neurogranin and cognitive impairment in total Parkinson's disease group (p = 0.017), as well as in the drug naive (p = 0.021) and with motor disease stage (p = 0.041). There were no significant disease-driven changes observed in the concentration of Rab3a. Concentrations SNAP25 and neurogranin were increased in cerebrospinal fluid of Parkinson's disease patients in a disease specific manner and related to cognitive and motor symptom severity. Future longitudinal studies should explore whether cerebrospinal fluid synaptic proteins can predict cognitive decline in Parkinson's disease.
