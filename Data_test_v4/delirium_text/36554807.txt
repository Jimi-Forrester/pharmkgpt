36554807|t|The Utility of High Intensity Interval Training to Improve Cognitive Aging in Heart Disease Patients.
36554807|a|Adults with cardiovascular disease and heart failure are at higher risk of cognitive decline. Cerebral hypoperfusion appears to be a significant contributor, which can result from vascular dysfunction and impairment of cerebral blood flow regulation. In contrast, higher cardiorespiratory fitness shows protection against brain atrophy, reductions in cerebral blood flow, and cognitive decline. Given that high intensity interval training (HIIT) has been shown to be a potent stimulus for improving cardiorespiratory fitness and peripheral vascular function, its utility for improving cognitive aging is an important area of research. This article will review the physiology related to cerebral blood flow regulation and cognitive decline in adults with cardiovascular disease and heart failure, and how HIIT may provide a more optimal stimulus for improving cognitive aging in this population.
