35552176|t|Pulmonary Endarterectomy in Patients with Antiphospholipid Syndrome-Associated Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension.
35552176|a|BACKGROUND: Antiphospholipid syndrome is an autoimmune disease characterized by the occurrence of venous and/or arterial thrombosis. Chronic thromboembolism is one of the known established pathogenesis of pulmonary hypertension, known as chronic thrombo-embolic pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary endarterectomy is the treatment of choice for chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. The aim of this study is to evalu-ate the efficacy and risk of pulmonary endarterectomy in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome-associated chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. METHODS: Data were prospectively collected and retrospectively analyzed, for patientswho underwent pulmonary endarterectomy between March 2011 and March 2020. RESULTS: Seventeen patients (4 male and 13 female) were identified. Thirteen patients had primary antiphospholipid syndrome and 4 had secondary antiphospholipid syndrome. The mean age was 34.82 +- 10.07 years and the mean time interval between the diagno-sis and surgery was 26.94 +- 17.35 months. Dyspnea on exertion was the main symptom in all patients. Seven patients had previous deep vein thrombosis, 5 patients had a history of recurrent abortions, and 2 patients had hemoptysis. Following surgery, mean pulmo-nary artery pressure decreased from 47.82 +- 13.11 mm Hg to 22.24 +- 4.56 mm Hg (P < .001), and pulmonary vascular resistance improved from 756.50 +- 393.91 dyn/s/cm-5 to 298.31 +-132.84 dyn/s/cm-5 (P < .001). There was no in-hospital mortality with a mean follow-up of 75.29 +- 40.21 months. The functional capacity of all patients improved from 269.46 +-111.7 m to 490 +- 105.34 m on a 6-minute walking test. CONCLUSIONS: Pulmonary endarterectomy is a safe and curative treatment in patientswith antiphospholipid syndrome-associated chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hyper-tension. It has a favorable outcome by increasing the quality of life. A multidisciplinary experienced chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension team is critical in the management of these unique patients.
