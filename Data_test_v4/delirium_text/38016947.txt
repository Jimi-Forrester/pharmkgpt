38016947|a|In Alzheimer's disease (AD) more than 50% of the patients are affected by capillary cerebral amyloid-angiopathy (capCAA), which is characterized by localized hypoxia, neuro-inflammation and loss of blood-brain barrier (BBB) function. Moreover, AD patients with or without capCAA display increased vessel number, indicating a reactivation of the angiogenic program. The molecular mechanism(s) responsible for BBB dysfunction and angiogenesis in capCAA is still unclear, preventing a full understanding of disease pathophysiology. The Liver X receptor (LXR) family, consisting of LXRalpha and LXRbeta, was reported to inhibit angiogenesis and particularly LXRalpha was shown to secure BBB stability, suggesting a major role in vascular function. In this study, we unravel the regulatory mechanism exerted by LXRalpha to preserve BBB integrity in human brain endothelial cells (BECs) and investigate its role during pathological conditions. We report that LXRalpha ensures BECs identity via constitutive inhibition of the transcription factor SNAI2. Accordingly, deletion of brain endothelial LXRalpha is associated with impaired DLL4-NOTCH signalling, a critical signalling pathway involved in vessel sprouting. A similar response was observed when BECs were exposed to hypoxia, with concomitant LXRalpha decrease and SNAI2 increase. In support of our cell-based observations, we report a general increase in vascular SNAI2 in the occipital cortex of AD patients with and without capCAA. Importantly, SNAI2 strongly associated with vascular amyloid-beta deposition and angiopoietin-like 4, a marker for hypoxia. In hypoxic capCAA vessels, the expression of LXRalpha may decrease leading to an increased expression of SNAI2, and consequently BECs de-differentiation and sprouting. Our findings indicate that LXRalpha is essential for BECs identity, thereby securing BBB stability and preventing aberrant angiogenesis. These results uncover a novel molecular pathway essential for BBB identity and vascular homeostasis providing new insights on the vascular pathology affecting AD patients.
