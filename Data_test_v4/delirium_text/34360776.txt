34360776|t|Biomarkers and Mechanisms of Oxidative Stress-Last 20 Years of Research with an Emphasis on Kidney Damage and Renal Transplantation.
34360776|a|Oxidative stress is an imbalance between pro- and antioxidants that adversely influences the organism in various mechanisms and on many levels. Oxidative damage occurring concomitantly in many cellular structures may cause a deterioration of function, including apoptosis and necrosis. The damage leaves a molecular "footprint", which can be detected by specific methodology, using certain oxidative stress biomarkers. There is an intimate relationship between oxidative stress, inflammation, and functional impairment, resulting in various diseases affecting the entire human body. In the current narrative review, we strengthen the connection between oxidative stress mechanisms and their active compounds, emphasizing kidney damage and renal transplantation. An analysis of reactive oxygen species (ROS), antioxidants, products of peroxidation, and finally signaling pathways gives a lot of promising data that potentially will modify cell responses on many levels, including gene expression. Oxidative damage, stress, and ROS are still intensively exploited research subjects. We discuss compounds mentioned earlier as biomarkers of oxidative stress and present their role documented during the last 20 years of research. The following keywords and MeSH terms were used in the search: oxidative stress, kidney, transplantation, ischemia-reperfusion injury, IRI, biomarkers, peroxidation, and treatment.
