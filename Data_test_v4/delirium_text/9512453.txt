9512453|a|A growing body of evidence has suggested that oxidative stress may play a major role in the degeneration of neurons associated with several neurological diseases of aging including ALS, Parkinson's, and Alzheimer's disease; this has been the topic of numerous previous reviews and opinion papers (e.g. 1-10). The ability to construct genetically engineered mouse lines containing targeted mutations has done much to aid in the assessment of the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in both the initiation as well as the progression of these diseases and has markedly advanced research in the field. Most importantly, the creation of genetic animal models has strengthened the argument that antioxidants may be a useful therapy in the treatment of these types of disorders.
