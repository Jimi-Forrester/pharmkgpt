31550911|t|Direct evidence for binding of aluminum to NAP anti-amyloid peptide and its analogs.
31550911|a|NAP (NAPVSIPQ) is a small peptide derived from the activity-dependent neuroprotective protein (ADNP), which provides neuroprotection against amyloid-beta peptide toxicity associated with Alzheimer disease. Several metal ions are able to promote the formation of amyloid-beta peptide oligomers and protofibrils in human brain tissue. Although the relationship between metal ions and amyloid-beta peptide peptides is extensively investigated, that with the NAP peptide is less understood. Nevertheless, our previous research revealed unexpected iron binding to NAP peptide and its analogs. However, a link between aluminum ions, Alzheimer disease and amyloid-beta peptide or NAP peptides still remains controversial. Therefore, we have investigated the possible binding of aluminum ions to NAP peptide and its four analogs. Indeed, MALDI-ToF mass spectrometry (MS), including MS/MS study, and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy revealed an unexpected pattern of aluminum ion binding to both NAP peptide and its analogs. Our results have been discussed with respect to NAP protection against Alzheimer disease-related neurotoxicity.
