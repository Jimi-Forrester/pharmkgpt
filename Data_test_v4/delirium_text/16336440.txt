16336440|t|Clinical predictors for delirium tremens in alcohol dependence.
16336440|a|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: This study was aimed to find clinical predictors for developing delirium tremens (DT) in alcohol dependence. METHODS: This cohort study was retrospectively carried out among patients who were diagnosed as having alcohol dependence between January 2001 and July 2004. Fifteen parameters were compared between patients who developed DT and ones who did not. We identified clinical predictors for DT by using multivariate analysis. RESULTS: A total of one hundred and seventy-eight consecutive admission cases from 147 patients were analyzed. The mean age was 47.8 years, and 95.5% were male. Delirium tremens developed in 59 cases (33%) during hospitalization. On multiple logistic regression analysis, a previous history of DT (odds ratio (OR) 3.990; 95% CI 1.631, 9.759) and high pulse rate above 100 b.p.m. (OR 4.158; 95% CI 2.032, 8.511) were significant predictors for developing DT. When combined, DT developed in just 20.4% of cases without any predictors; however, if one predictor was present, DT developed in 45.6%, and if two predictors were present, DT developed in all cases (100%). CONCLUSIONS: A simple assessment using the past history of DT and the pulse rate, which may be easily evaluated in clinical settings, can allow physicians to readily identify the patients who are at a high risk of developing DT during an alcohol dependence period and reserve more intensive therapies for the selected cases.
