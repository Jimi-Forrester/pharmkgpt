36396268|a|This review discusses the evolving evidence base and clinical considerations for examining the direct and indirect effects of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic on the mental health of elderly individuals. It briefly addresses the cognitive and psychiatric outcomes in older adults who have survived COVID-19 infections and the complexity of appraising them during different stages of the pandemic. Indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of the geriatric population are also explored, including those influenced by quarantine, media campaigns, discrimination, and difficulties in accessing supportive services like long-term care and medical care.
