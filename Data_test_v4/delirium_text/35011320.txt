35011320|a|The aggregation of proteins into amyloid fibers is linked to more than forty still incurable cellular and neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple system atrophy, Alzheimer's disease and type 2 diabetes, among others. The process of amyloid formation is a main feature of cell degeneration and disease pathogenesis. Despite being methodologically challenging, a complete understanding of the molecular mechanism of aggregation, especially in the early stages, is essential to find new biological targets for innovative therapies. Here, we reviewed selected examples on alpha-syn showing how complementary approaches, which employ different biophysical techniques and models, can better deal with a comprehensive study of amyloid aggregation. In addition to the monomer aggregation and conformational transition hypothesis, we reported new emerging theories regarding the self-aggregation of alpha-syn, such as the alpha-helix rich tetramer hypothesis, whose destabilization induce monomer aggregation; and the liquid-liquid phase separation hypothesis, which considers a phase separation of alpha-syn into liquid droplets as a primary event towards the evolution to aggregates. The final aim of this review is to show how multimodal methodologies provide a complete portrait of alpha-syn oligomerization and can be successfully extended to other protein aggregation diseases.
