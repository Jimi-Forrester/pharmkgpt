36341779|a|Psychosocially-stressed individuals might have exacerbated responses to air pollution exposure. Acute ozone exposure activates the neuroendocrine stress response leading to systemic metabolic and lung inflammatory changes. We hypothesized chronic mild stress (CS) and/or social isolation (SI) would cause neuroendocrine, inflammatory, and metabolic phenotypes that would be exacerbated by an acute ozone exposure. Male 5-week-old Wistar-Kyoto rats were randomly assigned into 3 groups: no stress (NS) (pair-housed, regular-handling); SI (single-housed, minimal-handling); CS (single-housed, subjected to mild unpredicted-randomized stressors [restraint-1 h, tilted cage-1 h, shaking-1 h, intermittent noise-6 h, and predator odor-1 h], 1-stressor/day*5-days/week*8-weeks. All animals then 13-week-old were subsequently exposed to filtered-air or ozone (0.8-ppm) for 4 h and immediately necropsied. CS, but not SI animals had increased adrenal weights. However, relative to NS, both CS and SI had lower circulating luteinizing hormone, prolactin, and follicle-stimulating hormone regardless of exposure (SI > CS), and only CS demonstrated lower thyroid-stimulating hormone levels. SI caused more severe systemic inflammation than CS, as evidenced by higher circulating cytokines and cholesterol. Ozone exposure increased urine corticosterone and catecholamine metabolites with no significant stressor effect. Ozone-induced lung injury, and increases in lavage-fluid neutrophils and IL-6, were exacerbated by SI. Ozone severely lowered circulating thyroid-stimulating hormone, prolactin, and luteinizing hormone in all groups and exacerbated systemic inflammation in SI. Ozone-induced increases in serum glucose, leptin, and triglycerides were consistent across stressors; however, increases in cholesterol were exacerbated by SI. Collectively, psychosocial stressors, especially SI, affected the neuroendocrine system and induced adverse metabolic and inflammatory effects that were exacerbated by ozone exposure.
