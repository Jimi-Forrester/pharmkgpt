34761873|a|A series of chemical optimizations, which was guided by in vitro affinity at histamine H3 receptor (H3 R), modulation of lipophilicity, ADME properties and preclinical efficacy resulted in the identification of 1-[2-(1-cyclobutylpiperidin-4-yloxy)-6,7-dihydro-4H-thiazolo[5,4-c]pyridin-5-yl]propan-1-one (45 e) as a potent and selective (Ki =4.0 nM) H3 R inverse agonist. Dipsogenia induced by (R)-alpha-methylhistamine was dose dependently antagonized by 45 e, confirming its functional antagonism at H3 R. It is devoid of hERG and phospholipidosis issues. Compound 45 e has adequate oral exposures and favorable half-life in both rats and dogs. It has demonstrated high receptor occupancy (ED80 =0.22 mg/kg) and robust efficacy in object recognition task and, dose dependently increased acetylcholine levels in brain. The sub-therapeutic doses of 45 e in combination with donepezil significantly increased acetylcholine levels. The potent affinity, selectivity, in vivo efficacy and drug like properties together with safety, warrant for further development of this molecule for potential treatment of cognitive disorders associated with Alzheimer's disease.
