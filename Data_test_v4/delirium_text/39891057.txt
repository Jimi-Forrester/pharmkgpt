39891057|a|Sepsis is associated with immune dysregulated and organ dysfunction due to severe infection. Clinicians aim to restore organ function, rather than prevent diseases that are prone to sepsis, resulting in high mortality and a heavy public health burden. Some chronic diseases can induce sepsis through inflammation cascade reaction and Cytokine Storm (CS). Interleukin (IL)-6, the core of CS, and its related signaling pathways have been considered as contributors to sepsis. Therefore, it is important to study the relationship between IL-6 and its related pathways in sepsis-related chronic diseases. This review generalized the mechanism of sepsis-related chronic diseases via IL-6 related pathways with the purpose to take rational management for these diseases. IL-6 related signaling pathways were sought in Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), and retrieved protein-protein interaction in the Search for Interaction Genes tool (STRING). In PubMed and Google Scholar, the studies were searched out, which correlating to IL-6 related pathways and associating with the pathological process of sepsis. Focused on the interactions of sepsis and IL-6 related pathways, some chronic diseases have been studied for association with sepsis, containing insulin resistance, Alcoholic liver disease (ALD), Alzheimer disease (AD), and atherosclerosis. This article summarized the inflammatory mechanisms of IL-6 cross-talked with other mediators of some chronic diseases in vitro, animal models, and human experiments, leading to the activation of pathways and accelerating the progression of sepsis. The clinicians should be highlight to this kind of diseases and more clinical trials are needed to provide more reliable theoretical basis for health policy formulation.
