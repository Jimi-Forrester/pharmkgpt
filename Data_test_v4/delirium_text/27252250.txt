27252250|a|Recent studies have postulated a role for vitamin D and its receptor on cerebral function, and anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory and neuroprotective effects have been described; vitamin D can inhibit proinflammatory cytokines and nitric oxide synthesis during various neurodegenerative insults, and may be considered as a potential drug for the treatment of these disorders. In addition, iron is crucial for neuronal development and neurotransmitter production in the brain, but its accumulation as catalytic form (Fe(3+)) impairs brain function and causes the dysregulation of iron metabolism leading to tissue damage due to the formation of toxic free radicals (ROS). This research was planned to study the role of vitamin D to prevent iron damage in neuroblastoma BE(2)M17 cells. Mechanisms involved in neurodegeneration, including cell viability, ROS production, and the most common intracellular pathways were studied. Pretreatment with calcitriol (the active form of vitamin D) reduced cellular injury induced by exposure to catalytic iron.
