34316149|a|BACKGROUND: Nursing Delirium Screening Scale (Nu-DESC) is a new instrument for determining delirium by nurses. The study aimed to investigate the psychometric properties of Nu-DESC and determined the sensitivity and specificity of it. METHODS: Two evaluators assessed delirium by Nu-DESC in nonintubated patients admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) wards of Ardabil educational and medical centers. For determining psychometric properties of the instrument, the methods of determining content validity, structural validity, criterion validity (the DSM-5 criteria was used as a standard tool), internal consistency, and inter-rater reliability were used. RESULTS: Ninety-six participants were assessed two times using the Nu-DESC. The mean age of the participants was 58.84, and 51 (53.1%) of them were male. Due to the high correlation of the Nu-DESC with the study criterion (DSM-5), the criterion validity of the instrument is confirmed. By using DSM-5 instrument, the cutoff score of 2 shows the best sensitivity and specificity. The kappa and alpha coefficients were obtained as r = 0.96 and alpha = 0.86, which indicate a good agreement between the evaluators and acceptable consistency. CONCLUSION: Nu-DESC can be used as an efficient and reliable instrument by nurses in the ICU. It was also found that taking medical history can help nurses to better interpret the Nu-DESC score at diagnosing delirium.
