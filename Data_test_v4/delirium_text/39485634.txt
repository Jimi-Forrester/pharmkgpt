39485634|t|Optimizing Pediatric Sedation: Evaluating Remimazolam and Dexmedetomidine for Safety and Efficacy in Clinical Practice.
39485634|a|Daily, children undergo countless investigations and interventions, which require sedation and immobilization to ensure safety and accuracy. This remains associated with a persistent risk of sedation-induced life-threatening events as children are particularly vulnerable to adverse medical events and complications. Consequently, there is an urgent need to increase the safety of pediatric sedation and anesthesia. An ideal approach involves the use of drugs with fewer intrinsic side effects. In this context, on the basis of their pharmacokinetic properties, remimazolam (RMZ) and dexmedetomidine (DEX) were evaluated for their suitability as ideal sedatives. RMZ and DEX, both of which are currently available in pediatric medicine, have shown great promise in initial publications. To date, only very limited data concerning RMZ in small children are available. RMZ is a novel, ultrashort-acting benzodiazepine that is metabolized by tissue esterase, largely independent of organ function. It has a context-sensitive half-life of approximately 10 min, with minimal accumulation even with prolonged use. Its effects can be completely reversed with flumazenil. DEX, an isomer of medetomidine, is a potent alpha2-receptor-agonist with multiple indications in anesthesia and intensive care medicine. It has coanalgesic potential, allows for 'arousal sedations' and has a low profile for cardiorespiratory side effects. DEX is metabolized in the liver and is predominantly excreted renally. Both drugs show potential in the prevention and treatment of delirium, with DEX having additional neuroprotective effects. DEX and RMZ possess several properties of an optimal sedative, including clinically insignificant main metabolites and a broad dosage range, indicating their potential to reduce the incidence of sedation-related life-threatening events in children. However, further clinical research is necessary to better evaluate their potential risks.
