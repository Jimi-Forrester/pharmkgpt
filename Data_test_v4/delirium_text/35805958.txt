35805958|t|Role of Impaired Mitochondrial Dynamics Processes in the Pathogenesis of Alzheimer's Disease.
35805958|a|Mitochondrial dysfunction is now recognized as a contributing factor to neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Mitochondria are signaling organelles with a variety of functions ranging from energy production to the regulation of cellular metabolism, energy homeostasis, and response to stress. The successful functioning of these complex processes is critically dependent on the accuracy of mitochondrial dynamics, which includes the ability of mitochondria to change shape and position in the cell, which is necessary to maintain proper function and quality control, especially in polarized cells such as neurons. There has been much evidence to suggest that the disruption of mitochondrial dynamics may play a critical role in the pathogenesis of AD. This review highlights aspects of altered mitochondrial dynamics in AD that may contribute to the etiology of this debilitating condition. We also discuss therapeutic strategies to improve mitochondrial dynamics and function that may provide an alternative treatment approach.
