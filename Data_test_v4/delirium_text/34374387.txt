34374387|a|Polygonum multiflorum Thunb (PMT), as a traditional Chinese herbal medicine, has been widely used in the prevention and treatment of aging-related diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, hyperlipidemia, atherosclerosis and inflammation. However, the effect of PMT on the lifespan and its molecular mechanisms are still unclear. Here we found that 60% ethanol refined fraction (PMT-E) of Polygonum multiflorum Thunb at 50 mug mL-1, which contained two main bioactive compounds, 2,3,5,4'-tetrahydroxystilbene-2-O-beta-D-glucoside (TSG) and emodin-8-O-beta-D-glucoside (EG), could significantly increase the mean lifespan by 19.82%, delay the age-related decline of phenotypes, enhance stress resistance and reduce ROS accumulation in Caenorhabditis elegans. Moreover, we also found that the mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsi) and ATP content of worms treated with 50 mug mL-1 PMT-E were obviously improved. Further mechanistic studies revealed that DAF-16, SIR-2.1 and SKN-1 transcription factors were required for PMT-E-mediated lifespan extension. Finally, we found that PMT-E could significantly inhibit the toxicity induced by beta-amyloid (Abeta) in Abeta transgenic worms. Altogether, these findings laid the foundation for the use of Polygonum multiflorum Thunb to treat aging and age-related diseases.
