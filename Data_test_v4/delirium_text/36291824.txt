36291824|t|Metabolomic and Lipidomic Profiling of Gliomas-A New Direction in Personalized Therapies.
36291824|a|In addition to being the most common primary brain tumor, gliomas are also among the most difficult to diagnose and treat. At present, the "gold standard" in glioma treatment entails the surgical resection of the largest possible portion of the tumor, followed by temozolomide therapy and radiation. However, this approach does not always yield the desired results. Additionally, the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier remains a major challenge for new potential drugs. Thus, researchers continue to search for targeted therapies that can be individualized based on the specific characteristics of each case. Metabolic and lipidomic research may represent two of the best ways to achieve this goal, as they enable detailed insights into the changes in the profile of small molecules in a biological system/specimen. This article reviews the new approaches to glioma therapy based on the analysis of alterations to biochemical pathways, and it provides an overview of the clinical results that may support personalized therapies in the future.
