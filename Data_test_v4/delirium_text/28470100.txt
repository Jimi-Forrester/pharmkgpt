28470100|t|Dexmedetomidine Effect on Emergence Agitation and Delirium in Children Undergoing Laparoscopic Hernia Repair: a Preliminary Study.
28470100|a|Objective To evaluate the safety and efficacy of dexmedetomidine (Dex) to prevent emergence agitation (EA) and delirium (ED) in children undergoing laparoscopic hernia repair under general anesthesia. Methods 100 children (1-5 years, 10-25 kg) were randomized into four groups: controls (saline) and intravenous Dex at 0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 microg/kg (D1, D2, D3, respectively). Dex/saline infusion was started following anesthesia. EA and ED were evaluated on a 5-point scale. Results For the C, D1, D2, and D3 groups, respectively, EA frequencies were 45.8%, 30.4%, 12%, 4%; ED frequencies 29.1%, 13%, 4%, 4%; CHIPPS scores 8, 6, 3, 3; sevoflurane doses from 13.2 +- 3.4 (controls) to 9.4 +- 3.5 ml (D3). Intervals until mask removal/spontaneous eye opening were significantly longer for D2 and D3 than controls. PACU stay was longer for D3. Conclusions There was significantly less postoperative EA and pain, with less sevoflurane required, using Dex.
