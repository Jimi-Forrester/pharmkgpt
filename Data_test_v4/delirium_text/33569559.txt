33569559|t|A Novel Computerized Cognitive Stress Test to Detect Mild Cognitive Impairment.
33569559|a|BACKGROUND: The Loewenstein Acevedo Scales of Semantic Interference and Learning (LASSI-L) is a novel and increasingly employed instrument that has outperformed widely used cognitive measures as an early correlate of elevated brain amyloid and neurodegeneration in prodromal Alzheimer's Disease (AD). The LASSI-L has distinguished those with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and high amyloid load from aMCI attributable to other non-AD conditions. The authors designed and implemented a web-based brief computerized version of the instrument, the LASSI-BC, to improve standardized administration, facilitate scoring accuracy, real-time data entry, and increase the accessibility of the measure. OBJECTIVE: The psychometric properties and clinical utility of the brief computerized version of the LASSI-L was evaluated, together with its ability to differentiate older adults who are cognitively normal (CN) from those with amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (aMCI). METHODS: After undergoing a comprehensive uniform clinical and neuropsychological evaluation using traditional measures, older adults were classified as cognitively normal or diagnosed with aMCI. All participants were administered the LASSI-BC, a computerized version of the LASSI-L. Test-retest and discriminant validity was assessed for each LASSI-BC subscale. RESULTS: LASSI-BC subscales demonstrated high test-retest reliability, and discriminant validity was attained. CONCLUSIONS: The LASSI-BC, a brief computerized version of the LASSI-L is a valid and useful cognitive tool for the detection of aMCI among older adults.
