29623158|t|Undiagnosed Partial Ornithine Transcarbamylase Deficiency Presenting Postoperatively as Agitated Delirium.
29623158|a|Partial ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency (pOTCD), an enzymatic defect within the urea cycle, is an increasingly recognized etiology for hyperammonemia of unclear source following a stressor within female adults. Here we present a case of newly diagnosed pOTCD following a systemic stressor and prolonged hospitalization course. From a neurological perspective, prompt recognition provided the patient with a swift and near complete recovery. We briefly review the pertinent literature pertaining to this genetically based condition including historical context and current therapeutic approaches. Given the potential morbidity of prolonged hyperammonemia, neurohospitalists need to be aware of partial ornithine transcarbamylase as an entity.
