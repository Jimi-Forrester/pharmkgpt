39075591|t|Service provision for Frailty in European Emergency Departments (FEED): a survey of operational characteristics.
39075591|a|BACKGROUND: The observational Frailty in European Emergency Departments (FEED) study found 40% of older people attending for care to be living with frailty. Older people with frailty have poorer outcomes from emergency care. Current best practice calls for early identification of frailty and holistic multidisciplinary assessment. This survey of FEED sites explores variations in frailty-attuned service definitions and provision. METHODS: This cross-sectional survey included study sites across Europe identified through snowball recruitment. Site co-ordinators (healthcare professionals in emergency and geriatric care) were surveyed online using Microsoft Forms. Items covered department and hospital capacity, frailty and delirium identification methods, staffing, and frailty-focused healthcare services in the ED. Descriptive statistics were reported. RESULTS: A total of 68 sites from 17 countries participated. Emergency departments had median 30 (IQR 21-53) trolley spaces. Most defined "older people" by age 65+ (64%) or 75+ (25%). Frailty screening was used at 69% of sites and mandated at 38%. Night-time staffing was lower compared to day-time for nursing (10 [IQR 8-14] vs. 14 [IQR 10-18]) and physicians (5 [IQR 3-8] vs. 10 [IQR 7-15]). Most sites had provision for ED frailty specialist services by day, but these services were rarely available at night. Sites mostly had accessible facilities; however, hot meals were rarely available at night (18%). CONCLUSION: This survey demonstrated variability in case definitions, screening practices, and frailty-attuned service provision. There is no unanimous definition for older age, and while the Clinical Frailty Scale was commonly used, this was rarely mandated or captured in electronic records. Frailty services were often unavailable overnight. Appreciation of the variation in frailty service models could inform operational configuration and workforce development.
