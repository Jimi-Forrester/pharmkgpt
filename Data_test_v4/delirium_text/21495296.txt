21495296|a|Vascular dementia is the form of dementia associated with cerebrovascular disease. It involves complex interrelationships between vascular etiologies, pathological changes in the brain, and clinical symptoms. Vascular dementia is associated with vascular and other risk factors, including cognitive ability, age, and education. Vascular dementia is the second most common cause of dementia, having a high rate of causes by itself, or in combination with Alzheimer's disease. Further complicating the diagnosis and treatment of vascular dementia is that it often coexists with Alzheimer's disease in elderly patients. It can be difficult to determine whether vascular abnormality has caused dementia, has contributed to its development, or is simply coincidental. When both vascular and degenerative changes may be contributing to the cognitive decline, term "Mixed" dementia is used. There are many questions still to be answered as to the incidence and prevalence of vascular dementia. Once there is a consensus on what diagnostic criteria should be used and how they should be implemented, or witch are the prevalence and incidence rates for vascular dementia by age, sex, region etc.
