25428986|t|Methionine sulfoxide reductase 2 reversibly regulates Mge1, a cochaperone of mitochondrial Hsp70, during oxidative stress.
25428986|a|Peptide methionine sulfoxide reductases are conserved enzymes that reduce oxidized methionines in protein(s). Although these reductases have been implicated in several human diseases, there is a dearth of information on the identity of their physiological substrates. By using Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model, we show that of the two methionine sulfoxide reductases (MXR1, MXR2), deletion of mitochondrial MXR2 renders yeast cells more sensitive to oxidative stress than the cytosolic MXR1. Our earlier studies showed that Mge1, an evolutionarily conserved nucleotide exchange factor of Hsp70, acts as an oxidative sensor to regulate mitochondrial Hsp70. In the present study, we show that Mxr2 regulates Mge1 by selectively reducing MetO at position 155 and restores the activity of Mge1 both in vitro and in vivo. Mge1 M155L mutant rescues the slow-growth phenotype and aggregation of proteins of mxr2Delta strain during oxidative stress. By identifying the first mitochondrial substrate for Mxrs, we add a new paradigm to the regulation of the oxidative stress response pathway.
