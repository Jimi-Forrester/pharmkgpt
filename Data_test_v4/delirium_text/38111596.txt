METHODS: Forty-six participants (50.3 +- 27.1 years; 67% female; 20 young unimpaired, 17 old unimpaired, 9 mildly cognitively impaired) completed ASSET 7 times. ASSET comprises two main tasks, simulating a Patient Portal and a Calendar. We assessed ASSET's internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and user experience. RESULTS: ASSET main tasks correlated with each other (r = 0.75, 95% confidence interval [CI] = [0.58, 0.86]). Performance on ASSET's Patient Portal related to cognition (r = 0.64, 95% CI = [0.42, 0.79]) and observer ratings of everyday functioning (r = 0.57, 95% CI = [0.24, 0.79]). Test-retest reliability was good (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.87, 95% CI = [0.77, 0.93]). Most participants rated their experience with ASSET neutrally or positively. DISCUSSION: ASSET is a promising smartphone-based digital assessment of everyday functioning. Future studies may investigate its utility for early diagnosis and evaluation of treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
