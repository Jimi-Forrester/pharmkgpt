12567330|t|Alzheimer's disease: from molecular biology to neuropsychiatry.
12567330|a|Alzheimer's disease is a clinical syndrome reflecting the topography and rate of progression of amyloid-associated cell death and dysfunction. Abnormal processing of amyloid precursor protein or enhanced accumulation of brain amyloid incites multiple pathogenetic pathway including inflammation, oxidation, and tau protein hyperphosphorylation that lead to neuronal death. The molecular biology of Alzheimer's disease provides insight into the clinical phenotype. The steps of the amyloid cascade present multiple targets for drug development and identification of effective disease-modifying anti-Alzheimer's disease treatments.
