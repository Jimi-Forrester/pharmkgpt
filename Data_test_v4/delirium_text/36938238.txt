36938238|t|Hiccups and Slurring of Speech: Atypical Presentation of High-Altitude Cerebral Edema.
36938238|a|High-altitude cerebral edema (HACE) is one of the rare and severe form of high-altitude mountain sickness. Usually it presents as headache, altered mental status, ataxia in un-acclimatized person with rapid ascent to high altitude. Here we report a case of a 62-year-old male patient who had history of rapid ascent to high altitude and presented to the department of emergency after descent from high altitude with an atypical presentation as hiccups and slurring of speech. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of brain showed white matter edema suggestive of HACE. The patient improved after treatment with supplemental oxygen, dexamethasone, and acetazolamide. He was discharged after three days of hospital stay with complete resolution of symptoms.
