11940893|t|Postictal Delirium (and Recovery From Melancholia) After Left-Unilateral ECT.
11940893|a|Postictal delirium was observed after left-unilateral ECT in a fully dextral man whose melancholia entirely remitted with seven treatments. These findings suggest that it is premature to attribute either the syndrome of postictal delirium or the beneficial effects of ECT in melancholia primarily to right hemisphere mechanisms.
