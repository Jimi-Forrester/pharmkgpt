38260705|a|Nanoscale protein organization within the active zone (AZ) and post-synaptic density (PSD) influences synaptic transmission. Nanoclusters of presynaptic Munc13-1 are associated with readily releasable pool size and neurotransmitter vesicle priming, while postsynaptic PSD-95 nanoclusters coordinate glutamate receptors across from release sites to control their opening probability. Nanocluster number, size, and protein density vary between synapse types and with development and plasticity, supporting a wide range of functional states at the synapse. Whether or how the receptors themselves control this critical architecture remains unclear. One prominent PSD molecular complex is the NMDA receptor (NMDAR). NMDARs coordinate several modes of signaling within synapses, giving them the potential to influence synaptic organization through direct protein interactions or through signaling. We found that loss of NMDARs results in larger synapses that contain smaller, denser, and more numerous PSD-95 nanoclusters. Intriguingly, NMDAR loss also generates retrograde reorganization of the active zone, resulting in denser, more numerous Munc13-1 nanoclusters, more of which are aligned with PSD-95 nanoclusters. Together, these changes to synaptic nanostructure predict stronger AMPA receptor-mediated transmission in the absence of NMDARs. Notably, while prolonged antagonism of NMDAR activity increases Munc13-1 density within nanoclusters, it does not fully recapitulate these trans-synaptic effects. Thus, our results confirm that NMDARs play an important role in maintaining pre- and postsynaptic nanostructure and suggest that both decreased NMDAR expression and suppressed NMDAR activity may exert distinct effects on synaptic function, yet through unique architectural mechanisms.
