38300249|a|INTRODUCTION: Alcohol withdrawal delirium, commonly known as "delirium tremens (DT)", is the most severe clinical condition of alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS). Symptoms of DT include changes in consciousness and cognitive and perceptual impairments that fluctuate during the day. Treatment includes general support, such as helping the patient to re-orientate, close monitoring of vital signs and adequate hydration, and symptomatic treatment for agitation, autonomic instability, and hallucinations. In symptomatic treatment of DT, benzodiazepines are most commonly preferred due to their GABA-ergic effects. Diazepam, a benzodiazepine, has a faster onset of action than other benzodiazepines when administered intravenously (iv) and effectively controls symptoms. Although low doses of diazepam usually relieve DT symptoms, very high doses may be required in some patients. This case series discusses patients receiving high doses of diazepam to relieve DT symptoms. CASE REPORT: Four male patients aged from 43 to 57 years who regularly consumed alcohol with a daily average of 20-100 standard drinks and developed DT afterwards and were followed up in the intensive care unit are presented. In these patients, the symptoms of DT were relieved, and somnolence was achieved with the administration of very high-dose IV diazepam (260-480 mg/day), contrary to routine treatment doses. All patients were successfully treated and discharged without any morbidity. CONCLUSION: Severe AWS can potentially result in death otherwise managed quickly and adequately. Diazepam is a suitable agent for severe AWS or DT treatment. Clinicians should keep in mind that high-dose diazepam treatment may be required in the treatment of DT that develops after a long-term and high amount of alcohol consumption. Publications reporting the need for very high doses of diazepam in DT are limited and usually published long ago; in this context, our findings are significant. The evidence is often based on case reports and uncontrolled studies, so controlled trials are needed to determine optimal treatment doses in severe DT.
