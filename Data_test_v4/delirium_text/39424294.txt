39424294|t|Exogenous Amyloid Fibrils Can Cause Significant Upregulation of Neurodegenerative Disease Proteins.
39424294|a|Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, are associated with the formation of amyloid fibrils. In familial cases, the mutant causative genes accentuate disease progression through overexpression or misfolding of amyloidogenic proteins. Besides, considerable amyloidosis cases arise from external factors, but their origin and mechanisms are not yet fully understood. Herein, we found that amyloid fibrils generated from egg and milk proteins, in addition to their nutritional effects to intestinal cells, can selectively reduce the viability of nervous cells as well as pancreatic islet cells. In contrast, soy protein amyloid fibrils lacked cytotoxicity to the aforementioned cells. This protein source and cell type-dependent cytotoxicity are demonstrated to be associated with the significant upregulation of amyloidogenic proteins. The finding was also confirmed by the vein injection of beta-lactoglobulin fibrils to mice, exhibiting the pronounced upregulations of amyloid beta1-42 (Abeta1-42) and islet amyloid polypeptide in vivo. The study therefore provides insight into the health implications of exogenous amyloid fibrils.
