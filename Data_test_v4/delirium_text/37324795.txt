37324795|t|Ultrasonography for Assessment of Sarcopenia: A Primer.
37324795|a|The human skeletal muscle has a pivotal role in preserving health by maintaining mobility, balance, and metabolic homeostasis. Significant muscle loss as a part of aging and accelerated by disease leads to sarcopenia which becomes an important predictor of quality of life in older persons. Therefore, clinical screening for sarcopenia and validation by precise qualitative and quantitative measurement of skeletal muscle mass (MM) and function is at the center-stage of translational research. Many imaging modalities are available, each having their strengths and limitations, either in interpretation, technical processes, time constraints, or expense. B-mode ultrasonography (US) is a relatively novel approach to evaluating muscle. It can measure several parameters such as MM and architecture simultaneously including muscle thickness, cross-sectional area, echogenicity, pennate angle, and fascicle length. It can also evaluate dynamic parameters like muscle contraction force and muscle microcirculation. US has not gained global attention due to a lack of consensus on standardization and diagnostic threshold values to diagnose sarcopenia. However, it is an inexpensive and widely available technique with clinical applicability. The ultrasound-derived parameters correlate well with strength and functional capacity and provide potential prognostic information. Our aim is to present an update on the evidence-based role of this promising technique in sarcopenia, its advantages over the existing modalities, and its limitations in actual practice with the hope that it may emerge as the "stethoscope" for community diagnosis of sarcopenia.
