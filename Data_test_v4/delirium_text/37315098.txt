37315098|a|OBJECTIVE: Patient sitters are frequently used in acute care hospitals to provide one-to-one care for agitated or disorientated patients to assure the safety and well-being of patients. However, there is still a lack of evidence on the use of patient sitters, especially in Switzerland. Therefore, the aim of this study was to describe and explore the use of patient sitters in a Swiss acute care hospital. METHODS: In this retrospective, observational study we included all inpatients who were hospitalized between January and December 2018 in a Swiss acute care hospital and required a paid or volunteer patient sitter. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the extent of patient sitter use, patient characteristics, and organizational factors. For the subgroup analysis between internal medicine and surgical patients Mann-Whitney U tests and chi-square tests were used. RESULTS: Of the total of 27'855 included inpatients, 631 (2.3%) needed a patient sitter. Of these, 37.5% had a volunteer patient sitter. The median patient sitter duration per patient per stay was 18.0 hours (IQR = 8.4-41.0h). The median age was 78 years (IQR = 65.0-86.0); 76.2% of patients were over the age of 64. Delirium was diagnosed in 41% of patients, and 15% had dementia. Most of the patients showed signs of disorientation (87.3%), inappropriate behavior (84.6%), and risk of falling (86.6%). Patient sitter uses varied during the year and between surgical and internal medicine units. CONCLUSIONS: These results add to the limited body of evidence concerning patient sitter use in hospitals, supporting previous findings related to patient sitter use for delirious or geriatric patients. New findings include the subgroup analysis of internal medicine and surgical patients, as well as analysis of patient sitter use distribution throughout the year. These findings may contribute to the development of guidelines and policies regarding patient sitter use.
