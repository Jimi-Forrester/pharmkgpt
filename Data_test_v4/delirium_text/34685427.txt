34685427|a|The dysfunctional effects of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection on the nervous system are established. The manifestation of neuropsychiatric symptoms during and after infection is influenced by the neuroinvasive and neurotrophic properties of SARS-CoV-2 as well as strong inflammation characterised by a specific "cytokine storm". Research suggests that a strong immune response to a SARS-CoV-2 infection and psychological stressors related to the pandemic may cause chronic inflammatory processes in the body with elevated levels of inflammatory markers contributing to the intensification of neurodegenerative processes. It is suggested that neuroinflammation and associated central nervous system changes may significantly contribute to the etiopathogenesis of depressive disorders. In addition, symptoms after a COVID-19 infection may persist for up to several weeks after an acute infection as a post-COVID-19 syndrome. Moreover, previous knowledge indicates that among SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) group antidepressants, fluoxetine is a promising drug against COVID-19. In conclusion, further research, observation and broadening of the knowledge of the pathomechanism of a SARS-CoV-2 infection and the impact on potential complications are necessary. It is essential to continue research in order to assess the long-term neuropsychiatric effects in COVID-19 patients and to find new therapeutic strategies.
