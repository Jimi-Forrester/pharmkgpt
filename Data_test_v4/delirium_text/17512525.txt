17512525|a|Intraneuronal inclusions made of hyperphosphorylated microtubule-associated protein tau are a defining neuropathological characteristic of Alzheimer's disease, and of several other neurodegenerative disorders. Many phosphorylation sites in tau are S/TP sites that flank the microtubule-binding repeats. Others are KXGS motifs in the repeats. One site upstream of the repeats lies in a consensus sequence for AGC kinases. This site (S214) is believed to play an important role in the events leading from normal, soluble to filamentous, insoluble tau. Here, we show that all AGC kinases tested phosphorylated S214. RSK1 and p70 S6 kinase also phosphorylated the neighbouring T212, a TP site that conforms weakly to the AGC kinase consensus sequence. MSK1 phosphorylated S214, as well as S262, a KXGS site in the first repeat, and S305 in the second repeat.
