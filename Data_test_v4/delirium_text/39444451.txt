Methods: A high-confidence lipodystrophy gene panel comprising 50 genes was created, and their expressions were measured in the visceral and subcutaneous (both peripheral and abdominal) adipose depots of MetS and non-MetS individuals at a tertiary care medical facility. Results: Most lipodystrophy genes showed significant downregulation in MetS individuals compared to non-MetS individuals in both subcutaneous and visceral depots. In the abdominal compartment, all the genes showed relatively higher expression in visceral depot as compared to their subcutaneous counterpart, and this difference narrowed with increasing severity of MetS. Their expression level shows an inverse correlation with T2D, MetS, and HOMA-IR and with other T2D-related intermediate traits. Results also demonstrated that individualization of MetS patients could be done based on adipose tissue expression of just 12 genes. Conclusion: Adipose tissue expression of lipodystrophy genes shows an association with MetS and its intermediate phenotypic traits. Mutations of these genes are known to cause congenital lipodystrophy syndromes, whereas their altered expression in adipose tissue contributes to the pathogenesis of IR, T2D, and MetS.
