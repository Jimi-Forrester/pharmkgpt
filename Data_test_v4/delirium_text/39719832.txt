39719832|t|Part 2: Drug Interactions Involving Cannabis Products in Persons Aged 18 and Over: A Summary of Published Case Reports and Analysis of the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System.
39719832|a|The increasing utilization of cannabis products combined with lack of data regarding potential cannabis-prescription drug interactions is concerning. This study aimed to review published case reports and FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) spontaneous reports to assess cannabis-drug interactions in persons aged 18 and over. A literature search identified 20 case reports that were each assessed for drug interaction causality using the Drug Interaction Probability Scale. Data collected from the FAERS revealed a greater proportion of reports mentioning serious outcomes, including death, when cannabis was used concomitantly with controlled substances compared to noncontrolled substances. Fisher's exact test showed a statistically significant difference between the controlled and noncontrolled groups (p = 0.043). Overall, these findings emphasize the need for additional research and vigilant monitoring of cannabis use when combined with other medications.
