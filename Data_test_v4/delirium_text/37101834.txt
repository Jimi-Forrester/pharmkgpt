Neurofilament light chain has shown great potential in CSF and blood for the distinction of frontotemporal dementia from primary psychiatric diseases. Measurement of neurofilament light chain in urine would be even more patient-friendly. We aimed to test the performance of neurofilament light chain urine measurements for diagnostics in frontotemporal dementia and to assess their correlation with serum levels. Fifty-five subjects (n = 19 frontotemporal dementia, n = 19 primary psychiatric diseases and n = 17 controls) were included with available paired urine and serum samples. All subjects underwent standardized extensive diagnostic assessment. Samples were analysed with the ultrasensitive single molecule array neurofilament light chain assay. Neurofilament light chain group comparisons were performed adjusted for age, sex and geriatric depression scale. In the majority of the cohort, neurofilament light chain concentrations were not detectable in urine (n = 6 samples above lower limit of detection (0.038 pg/ml): n = 5 frontotemporal dementia, n = 1 primary psychiatric disease). The frequency of a detectable neurofilament light chain level in urine in the frontotemporal dementia group did not differ from psychiatric disorders (Fisher Exact-test P = 0.180). In the individuals with detectable urine neurofilament light chain values, there was no correlation between the urine and serum neurofilament light chain levels. As expected, serum neurofilament light chain levels were higher in frontotemporal dementia compared to primary psychiatric diseases and controls (P < 0.001), adjusted for age, sex and geriatric depression scale. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis of serum neurofilament light chain of frontotemporal dementia versus primary psychiatric diseases showed an area under the curve of 0.978 95% confidence interval 0.941-1.000, P < 0.001. Urine is not suitable as a matrix for neurofilament light chain analysis and serum neurofilament light chain is still the most patient-friendly matrix for differentiation between frontotemporal dementia and primary psychiatric diseases.
