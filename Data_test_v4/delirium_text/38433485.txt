38433485|t|Psychotic Symptoms in Patients With Major Neurological Diseases.
38433485|a|Neurological diseases often manifest with neuropsychiatric symptoms such as depression, emotional incontinence, anger, apathy and fatigue. In addition, affected patients may also experience psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions. Various factors contribute to the development of psychotic symptoms, and the mechanisms of psychosis are similar, but still differ among various neurological diseases. Although psychotic symptoms are uncommon, and have been less well investigated, they may annoy patients and their families as well as impair the patients' quality of life and increase the caregiver burden. Therefore, we need to appropriately identify and treat these psychotic symptoms in patients with neurological diseases.
