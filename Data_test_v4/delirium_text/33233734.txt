33233734|t|Intranasal Delivery: Effects on the Neuroimmune Axes and Treatment of Neuroinflammation.
33233734|a|This review highlights the pre-clinical and clinical work performed to use intranasal delivery of various compounds from growth factors to stem cells to reduce neuroimmune interactions. We introduce the concept of intranasal (IN) delivery and the variations of this delivery method based on the model used (i.e., rodents, non-human primates, and humans). We summarize the literature available on IN delivery of growth factors, vitamins and metabolites, cytokines, immunosuppressants, exosomes, and lastly stem cells. We focus on the improvement of neuroimmune interactions, such as the activation of resident central nervous system (CNS) immune cells, expression or release of cytokines, and detrimental effects of signaling processes. We highlight common diseases that are linked to dysregulations in neuroimmune interactions, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, stroke, multiple sclerosis, and traumatic brain injury.
