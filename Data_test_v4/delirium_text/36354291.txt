36354291|t|Paraspeckles interact with SWI/SNF subunit ARID1B to regulate transcription and splicing.
36354291|a|Paraspeckles are subnuclear RNA-protein structures that are implicated in important processes including cellular stress response, differentiation, and cancer progression. However, it is unclear how paraspeckles impart their physiological effect at the molecular level. Through biochemical analyses, we show that paraspeckles interact with the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex. This is specifically mediated by the direct interaction of the long-non-coding RNA NEAT1 of the paraspeckles with ARID1B of the cBAF-type SWI/SNF complex. Strikingly, ARID1B depletion, in addition to resulting in loss of interaction with the SWI/SNF complex, decreases the binding of paraspeckle proteins to chromatin modifiers, transcription factors, and histones. Functionally, the loss of ARID1B and NEAT1 influences the transcription and the alternative splicing of a common set of genes. Our findings reveal that dynamic granules such as the paraspeckles may leverage the specificity of epigenetic modifiers to impart their regulatory effect, thus providing a molecular basis for their function.
