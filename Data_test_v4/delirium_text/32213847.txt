32213847|t|Interaction of Catechins with Human Erythrocytes.
32213847|a|The aim of this study was to characterize the interaction of chosen catechins ((+)-catechin, (-)-epigallocatechin (EGC), and (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG)) with human erythrocytes and their protective effects against oxidative damage of erythrocytes. Uptake of the catechins by erythrocytes was studied by fluorimetry, their interaction with erythrocyte membrane was probed by changes in erythrocyte osmotic fragility and in membrane fluidity evaluated with spin labels, while protection against oxidative damage was assessed by protection against hemolysis induced by permanganate and protection of erythrocyte membranes against lipid peroxidation and protein thiol group oxidation. Catechin uptake was similar for all the compounds studied. Accumulation of catechins in the erythrocyte membrane was demonstrated by the catechin-induced increase in osmotic resistance and rigidification of the erythrocyte membrane detected by spin labels 5-doxyl stearic acid and 16-doxyl stearic acid. (-)-Epigallocatechin and EGCG inhibited erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase (mixed-type inhibition). Catechins protected erythrocytes against permanganate-induced hemolysis, oxidation of erythrocyte protein thiol groups, as well as membrane lipid peroxidation. These results contribute to the knowledge of the beneficial effects of catechins present in plant-derived food and beverages.
