35601593|t|A Comparison of the Knowledge of Alzheimer's Disease among Community Pharmacists Based on Regional Practice Setting Using the Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Scale (ADKS).
35601593|a|Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most prevalent type of dementia and has a high prevalence in the aging population. Due to the requirements for care, it is valuable for members of the healthcare system to be knowledgeable about AD and its treatment. Community pharmacists are particularly valuable in assisting in AD care because of their accessibility to the general public and they are a source for dispensing AD medications. The purpose of this study is to assess the level of knowledge of AD among Ohio community pharmacists based on regional practice settings using the Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Scale (ADKS). A standardized, 30-question assessment tool known as the Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Scale exists to measure the level of knowledge of AD among a given population. Studies on AD knowledge have been conducted using this tool, and the use of this scale identifies major misconceptions about AD that could be addressed in education initiatives for both the general public and for health care professionals. This study implemented this tool to compare the knowledge of community pharmacists that serve rural areas to those that serve urban areas. The Ohio Board of Pharmacy provided a list of emails of community pharmacists to send an anonymous survey including both demographic questions and the ADKS. Statistical analyses including independent t-tests and descriptive statistics were conducted using SPSS to determine the significance of the data. This study found no statistically significant difference between urban versus rural community pharmacists. However, in the future we hope to identify specific questions that correlate to areas of AD where continuing education may be helpful in improving patient outcomes by enabling caregivers and healthcare providers with a more accurate understanding of AD.
