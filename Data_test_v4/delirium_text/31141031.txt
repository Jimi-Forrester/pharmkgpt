31141031|a|OBJECTIVE: to describe, in a practical and step-by-step manner, the construction of a fully electronic platform for data collection, storage, and analysis, initially proposed for cardiovascular surgery, with interfaces that are reproducible and applicable to other surgical specialties, as well as to present the initial work experience with this instrument in cardiac surgery and the preliminary results obtained after its implementation in a Brazilian tertiary university hospital. METHODS: the platform was developed based on Google tools, which are free, easy to use, and widely accessible. From the beginning of this initiative, in May 2015, to the preliminary analysis, in February 2017, data from 271 consecutive patients submitted to cardiovascular surgery were prospectively recorded and preliminarily analyzed. RESULTS: the initiative was implemented with full success, with 100% of patients included and without loss of any variable, in a database composed of more than 500 variables. The most frequent immediate postoperative complications were: atrial fibrillation (22.5%), bronchopneumonia (10.7%), delirium (10.3%), acute renal failure (10%), stroke (5%), and death (7%). Comparing mortality rates in the first and second years of the initiative, a reduction from 10.8% to 4% (p=0.042), respectively, was evidenced. CONCLUSION: the new proposal of data collection and storage presented in this work was fully feasible and effective. It may be useful to other surgical specialties that wish to develop methods to evaluate success and postoperative complication rates, as well as quality improvement programs.
