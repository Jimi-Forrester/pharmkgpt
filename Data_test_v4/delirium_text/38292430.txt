38292430|t|Behavioral, metabolic, and lipidomic characterization of the 5xFADxTg30 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
38292430|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with both extracellular amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques and intracellular tau-containing neurofibrillary tangles (NFT). We characterized the behavioral, metabolic and lipidomic phenotype of the 5xFADxTg30 mouse model which contains overexpression of both Abeta and tau. Our results independently reproduce several phenotypic traits described previously for this model, while providing additional characterization. This model develops many aspects associated with AD including frailty, decreased survival, initiation of aspects of cognitive decline and alterations to specific lipid classes and molecular lipid species in the plasma and brain. Notably, some sex-specific differences exist in this model and motor impairment with aging in this model does compromise the utility of the model for some movement-based behavioral assessments of cognitive function. These findings provide a reference for individuals interested in using this model to understand the pathology associated with elevated Abeta and tau or for testing potential therapeutics for the treatment of AD.
