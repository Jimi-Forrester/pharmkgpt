38928492|t|Proteomics Analysis of Proteotoxic Stress Response in In-Vitro Human Neuronal Models.
38928492|a|Heat stroke, a hazardous hyperthermia-related illness, is characterized by CNS injury, particularly long-lasting brain damage. A root cause for hyperthermic neurological damage is heat-induced proteotoxic stress through protein aggregation, a known causative agent of neurological disorders. Stress magnitude and enduring persistence are highly correlated with hyperthermia-associated neurological damage. We used an untargeted proteomic approach using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to identify and characterize time-series proteome-wide changes in dose-responsive proteotoxic stress models in medulloblastoma [Daoy], neuroblastoma [SH-SY5Y], and differentiated SH-SY5Y neuron-like cells [SH(D)]. An integrated analysis of condition-time datasets identified global proteome-wide differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) as part of the heat-induced proteotoxic stress response. The condition-specific analysis detected higher DEPs and upregulated proteins in extreme heat stress with a relatively conservative and tight regulation in differentiated SH-SY5Y neuron-like cells. Functional network analysis using ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) identified common intercellular pathways associated with the biological processes of protein, RNA, and amino acid metabolism and cellular response to stress and membrane trafficking. The condition-wise temporal pathway analysis in the differentiated neuron-like cells detects a significant pathway, functional, and disease association of DEPs with processes like protein folding and protein synthesis, Nervous System Development and Function, and Neurological Disease. An elaborate dose-dependent stress-specific and neuroprotective cellular signaling cascade is also significantly activated. Thus, our study provides a comprehensive map of the heat-induced proteotoxic stress response associating proteome-wide changes with altered biological processes. This helps to expand our understanding of the molecular basis of the heat-induced proteotoxic stress response with potential translational connotations.
