39957004|t|Investigating the Interplay of Thermal, Lighting, and Acoustics in Intensive Care for Enhanced Patient Well-being and Clinical Outcomes.
39957004|a|This research explores the interplay among noise levels, thermal conditions, and lighting intensity in an intensive care unit (ICU), focusing on preserving circadian rhythm and promoting nighttime sleep to advance patient-centric care. This investigation assesses lighting levels (Lux), natural versus artificial light ratios, ICU room temperature, and correlations with acoustic data during a field research period and examines the collective impact of patient exposure to sleep linked to delirium and health outcomes, addressing critical gaps in understanding. Findings reveal that noise levels between 60 and 90 dB(A) during patient occupancy exceed sleep disruption thresholds, with daytime averages of 53.6 dB(A) and nighttime averages of 48.5 dB(A) surpassing recommended criteria. Temperature fluctuations, often outside the optimal sleep range, and suboptimal diurnal variations impact patient comfort and clinician challenges. Lux levels mostly fall short of the optimum range, affecting circadian rhythms. Temporal distinctions of these environmental factors directly impact clinicians and patients, with correlated spikes in noise, lighting, and temperature during admission periods requiring heightened attention for optimal care. These cumulative impacts necessitate clinicians to navigate challenges and ensure consistent and effective care. Patients experience sleep disruptions, highlighting the need for a holistic healthcare design addressing interconnected environmental dynamics. The findings underscore the importance of comprehensive approaches to healthcare design, optimizing the ICU environment for patient-centric care and supporting healthcare professionals' well-being. Recommendations include targeted interventions to improve sleep, reduce delirium incidence, and enhance recovery, advancing ICU design for better patient outcomes; and facilitating effective communication among healthcare practitioners.
