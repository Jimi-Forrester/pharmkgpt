38533723|a|OBJECTIVES: This study sought to (1) identify the percentage of high-risk substance use or substance use disorder (SUD) and (2) examine the factors associated with high-risk substance use or SUD in adults aged 50 years and older receiving mental health treatment with a primary delirium or dementia diagnosis. METHOD: This study used 7 years (2013-2019) of national administrative data on community mental health center patients aged 50 years and older with a primary delirium or dementia diagnosis receiving treatment in the United States (U.S.). To examine factors associated with the dependent variable (high-risk substance use or SUD), a multivariable binary logistic regression model was utilized. RESULTS: The sample included 77,509 individuals who were mostly aged 65 years and older (69.7%), and did not have co-occurring high-risk substance use or SUD (90.1%). Receiving treatment in a U.S. region other than the Northeast, being younger, male, not non-Hispanic White, and having multiple mental health diagnoses had greater odds of co-occurring high-risk substance use or SUD. CONCLUSION: One in ten persons in this sample having high-risk substance use or SUD highlights the clinical necessity for screening and subsequent treatment for co-occurring high-risk substance use among persons receiving treatment for a neurocognitive disorder.
