38875108|t|FDA Approval Summary: Repotrectinib for locally advanced or metastatic ROS1-positive non-small cell lung cancer.
38875108|a|On November 15, 2023, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted traditional approval to repotrectinib (Augtyro , Bristol Myers Squibb Corporation), for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic ROS1-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The approval was based on TRIDENT-1, a single arm trial with multiple cohorts of patients with ROS1 fusion-positive (hereafter "ROS1-positive") NSCLC, (NCT03093116), who were either treatment naive or had received prior ROS1 TKI and/or platinum-based chemotherapy. The primary efficacy outcome measure is objective response rate (ORR) assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR) using response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. ORR was assessed in 71 patients who were ROS1 TKI naive and 56 patients who had received a prior ROS1 TKI. Among 71 patients who were ROS1 TKI naive, the ORR was 79% (95% CI 68, 88); median duration of response was 34.1 months (95% CI 26, NE). In patients who had received a prior ROS1 TKI and no prior chemotherapy, the ORR was 38% (95% CI 25, 52). The median duration of response was 14.8 months (95% CI 7.6, NE) BICR-assessed responses were observed in CNS metastases in patients in both cohorts, and in patients who developed resistance mutations following prior TKI therapy. The most common (> 20%) adverse reactions were dizziness, dysgeusia, peripheral neuropathy, constipation, dyspnea, ataxia, fatigue, cognitive disorders, and muscular weakness. A unique feature of this ROS1 TKI approval is the inclusion of robust evidence of efficacy in patients with ROS1-positive NSCLC who had progressed on prior ROS1 TKIs.
