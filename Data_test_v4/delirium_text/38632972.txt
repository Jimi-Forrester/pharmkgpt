In recent years, both radiomics and deep learning techniques have emerged as powerful tools for extracting valuable information from medical images. This article aims to provide a comparative analysis of radiomics features, 3D-deep learning convolutional neural network (CNN) and the fusion of them, in the evaluation of 18F-FDG PET whole brain images in patients with dementia and normal controls. METHODS: 18F-FDG brain PET and clinical score were collected in 85 patients with dementia and 125 healthy controls (HC). Patients were assigned to various form of dementia on the basis of clinical evaluation, follow-up and voxels comparison with HC using a two-sample Student's t-test, to determine the regions of brain involved. Radiomics analysis was performed on the whole brain after normalization to an optimized template. After selection using the minimum redundancy maximum relevance method and Pearson's correlation coefficients, the features obtained were added to a neural network model to find the accuracy in classifying HC and demented patients. Forty subjects not included in the training were used to test the models. The results of the three models (radiomics, 3D-CNN, combined model) were compared with each other. RESULTS: Four radiomics features were selected. The sensitivity was 100% for the three models, but the specificity was higher with radiomics and combined one (100% vs. 85%). Moreover, the classification scores were significantly higher using the combined model in both normal and demented subjects. CONCLUSION: The combination of radiomics features and 3D-CNN in a single model, applied to the whole brain 18FDG PET study, increases the accuracy in demented patients.
