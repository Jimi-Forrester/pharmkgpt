34046607|t|In vitro and in vivo sigma 1 receptor imaging studies in different disease states.
34046607|a|The sigma receptor system has been classified into two distinct subtypes, sigma 1 (sigma1R) and sigma 2 (sigma2R). Sigma 1 receptors (sigma1Rs) are involved in many neurodegenerative diseases and different central nervous system disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, and drug addiction, and pain. This makes them attractive targets for developing radioligands as tools to gain a better understanding of disease pathophysiology and clinical diagnosis. Over the years, several sigma1R radioligands have been developed to image the changes in sigma1R distribution and density providing insights into their role in disease development. Moreover, the involvement of both sigma1Rs and sigma2Rs with cancer make these ligands, especially those that are sigma2R selective, great tools for imaging different types of tumors. This review will discuss the principles of molecular imaging using PET and SPECT, known sigma1R radioligands and their applications for labelling sigma1Rs under different disease conditions. Furthermore, this review will highlight sigma1R radioligands that have demonstrated considerable potential as biomarkers, and an opportunity to fulfill the ultimate goal of better healthcare outcomes and improving human health.
