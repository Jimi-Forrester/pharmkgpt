39527018|t|Mortality in older adults with epilepsy: An understudied entity.
39527018|a|Despite the recognition of Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP) and other risks of premature mortality in people with epilepsy (PWE), mortality in older PWE remains an understudied entity. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the multifaceted causes of premature mortality in older adults with epilepsy and emphasizes the need for targeted interventions to reduce mortality and enhance the quality of life in this vulnerable population. It underscores the heightened prevalence of epilepsy among older adults and the interplay of intrinsic and extrinsic factors contributing to their mortality. Further, this paper delves into the nuances of diagnosing SUDEP in older adults and the underestimation of its incidence due to misclassification and lack of standardized protocols. Factors such as frailty, comorbidities, and the bidirectional relationship between epilepsy and conditions such as dementia and stroke further compound the mortality risks. Key factors, including status epilepticus, comorbid conditions (such as cardiovascular diseases, cerebrovascular events, and neurodegenerative disorders), and external causes like accidents, falls, and suicide, are discussed. It also examines the implications of anti-seizure medications, particularly polypharmacy, and their adverse effects on this population. Future directions include implementing enhanced diagnostic protocols, developing treatment plans, and integrating real-time monitoring technologies to reduce the risk of sudden death and multifaceted premature mortality in this patient population. Increasing awareness among healthcare providers and families about the risks and management of epilepsy in older adults, along with fostering collaborative research efforts, is essential to improve mortality outcomes. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: There is a heightened risk of mortality in older people with epilepsy due to many causes unique to their population. Despite the risk, Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy and early mortality in older adults with epilepsy are underestimated. Unique contributing factors include comorbid conditions like dementia, stroke, and frailty, adverse effects from polypharmacy, and increased risks of cardiovascular complications and external injuries such as falls and suicide. A careful consideration of all these factors can help mitigate the mortality in older adults with epilepsy.
