39401909|a|Phase 3 clinical trials have validated the clinical efficacy of some anti-amyloid beta (Abeta) antibody therapies, such as lecanemab and donanemab. To date, several clinical trials of anti-Abeta drugs have been conducted. However, most of these methods have been unsuccessful. Various Abeta aggregates are present during Abeta aggregation. The difference in the clinical efficacy of anti-Abeta antibody therapy may be attributed to variations in the Abeta aggregates targeted. Lecanemab primarily targets protofibrils, and donanemab targets plaques. Solanezumab and bapinezumab target Abeta aggregates of monomers alone or from monomers to low molecular weight oligomers. Anti-Abeta antibody therapies with clinical cognitive efficacy are thus characterized by targeting large-molecular-weight Abeta aggregates, such as protofibrils and plaques. In addition, a positive association was observed between the reduction in amyloid deposition and the inhibition of cognitive decline.
