32149247|t|Application of Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry for the Identification and Quantitation of Three Common Synthetic Cannabinoids in Seized Materials from the Jordanian Market.
32149247|a|Synthetic cannabinoids (SCs) were developed to mimic the effects of Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol on humans. SCs were distributed in the form of herbal blends, with smoking being the main method of consumption. These synthetic compounds have a wide range of physical, behavioral, and harmful effects on the body. However, this study aimed to identify and quantify three common SCs including AB-FUBINACA, AB-CHMINACA, and XLR-11 in the seized materials from the Jordanian market by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS). A liquid-liquid extraction sample preparation technique was applied to 100 different seized samples obtained from the Anti-Narcotics Department of Public Security in a period between 2017 and 2018. Profiling of the seized samples revealed different distributions of the targeted SCs in the obtained samples. Upon quantitation, concentrations of these SCs varied greatly within and among the samples. The use of GC-MS analysis provided a powerful technique in the detection and identification of SCs. This study revealed the current and trends of SC use in the Jordanian illicit substance market, which was previously unclear. Future studies are required to explore new SCs and their influence in different biological samples.
