39337674|t|Components in SLPE Alleviate AD Model Nematodes by Up-Regulating Gene gst-5.
39337674|a|Salvia leucantha is a perennial herb of the genus Salvia in the family Labiatae, which has a wide range of biological activities, mainly including inhibition of acetylcholinesterase, antibacterial, and anti-inflammatory activity. To explore the protective effects and mechanism of action of S. leucantha on Alzheimer's disease (AD), the anti-AD activity of SLE (extracts of S. leucantha) was determined by using a transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) model (CL4176). Analyses included paralysis assay, phenotypic experiments, transcriptome sequencing, RNA interference (RNAi), heat shock assays, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). SLPE (S. leucantha petroleum ether extract) could significantly delay CL4176 paralysis and extend the longevity of C. elegans N2 without harmful effects. A total of 927 genes were significantly changed by SLPE treatment in C. elegans, mainly involving longevity regulatory pathways-nematodes, drug metabolism-cytochrome P450, and glutathione metabolic pathways. RNAi showed that SLPE exerted its anti-AD activity through up-regulation of the gene gst-5; the most abundant compound in SLPE analyzed by GC-MS was 2,4-Di-tert-butylphenol (2,4-DTBP), and the compound delayed nematode paralysis. The present study suggests that active components in S. leucantha may serve as new-type anti-AD candidates and provide some insights into their biological functions.
