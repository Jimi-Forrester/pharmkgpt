35372762|t|Delirium can be safely managed in the community through implementation of a community toolkit: a proof-of-concept pilot study.
35372762|a|Delirium is an acute confusional state due to physical illness and is a frequent cause of hospital admission. In this article, we describe the development and outcomes for a community delirium toolkit pilot across Greater Manchester during the COVID-19 pandemic. We conclude that delirium can be safely managed in the community by using a toolkit that incorporates structured assessment and management. Carers and patients benefited from the use of a co-designed information leaflet.
