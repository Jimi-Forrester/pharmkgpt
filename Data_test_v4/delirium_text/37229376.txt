37229376|t|Relationship Between Delirium Development and Its Causative Factors in the Intensive Care Unit After Cardiac Surgery.
37229376|a|Background: Delirium is a clinical symptom that can have serious side effects in patients, and it develops acutely and shows reversibility. Postoperative delirium is an important neuropsychological complication after surgery that directly or indirectly affects patients. Cardiac surgery increases the risk of delirium due to the complexity of surgical procedures, use of intraoperative and postoperative anesthetics and other pharmacologic agents, and possible postoperative complications. This study aims to determine the relationship between the development of delirium and its causative factors after cardiac surgery and its associated postoperative complications, and identify the high-relevance risk factors of postoperative delirium. Methods: The participants comprised 730 patients who were admitted to the intensive care unit and underwent cardiac surgery. The collected data included 19 risk factors based on the patients' medical information records. As a delirium diagnostic tool, we used the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist, with four or more points indicating delirium. For statistical analysis, the dependent variables were determined based on the presence or absence of delirium, while the independent variables were determined based on the risk factors of delirium. A t-test, chi2 test, and logistic regression analysis were performed on risk factors between the two groups-the delirium group and no delirium group. Results: Postoperative delirium was observed in 126 (17.3%) of 730 patients after cardiac surgery. Postoperative complications were more common in the delirium group. Independent risk factors associated with postoperative delirium were identified in 7 of the 12 factors. Conclusion: As cardiac surgery is invasive and affects the development and severity of delirium, efforts and intervention methods are necessary to predict the risk factors for the development of delirium before surgery, and to prevent its occurrence after surgery. In the future, it is necessary to further investigate factors associated with delirium that can be directly intervened.
