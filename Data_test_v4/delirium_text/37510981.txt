37510981|a|BACKGROUND: We report a comparative analysis of extraperitoneal urethra-sparing robot-assisted simple prostatectomy (EUS-RASP) versus robot-assisted simple prostatectomy (RASP) using the Freyer approach for patients with a large prostate volume greater than 80 mL. METHODS: A total of 32 patients underwent EUS-RASP, and 30 underwent RASP from April 2018 to November 2021. All the perioperative data and 6-month follow-up data were collected prospectively. We retrospectively evaluated baseline characteristics and functional outcomes, including International Prostate Symptom Scores (IPSSs) and quality of life (QOL), maximum flow rate, and post-void residual volume, between the two groups. Sexual function was analyzed in the EUS-RASP group. RESULTS: The patients undergoing EUS-RASP and RASP had comparable baseline characteristics and functional outcomes. The EUS-RASP group showed a shorter operative time (123.4 +- 15.2 min vs. 133.7 +- 21.4 min, p = 0.034), length of hospital stay (2.9 +- 1.5 days vs. 4.6 +- 1.5 days, p = 0.001), and catheterization time (2.4 +- 1.7 days vs. 8.1 +- 2.4 days, p < 0.001). A total of 14/32 (43.8%) patients reported normal preoperative ejaculatory function in the EUS-RASP group, and 11/14 (78.6%) maintained antegrade ejaculation postoperatively. CONCLUSIONS: Extraperitoneal urethra-sparing RASP is an effective and feasible procedure that can improve voiding function and allow for the maintenance of ejaculatory function in patients with large prostates.
