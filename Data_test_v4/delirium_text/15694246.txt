15694246|t|Brain magnetic resonance imaging and single photon emission computerized tomography findings in a case of relapsing polychondritis showing cognitive impairment and personality changes.
15694246|a|A 57-year-old female with relapsing polychondritis (RP) showing CNS complications is described with reference to the MRI and SPECT findings. At the age of 56, the patient was diagnosed with RP based on her symptoms, which included bilateral auricular chondritis, nonerosive seronegative inflammatory polyarthritis, and ocular inflammation, as well as vestibular dysfunction. During the course of the disease, she suffered from aseptic meningitis accompanied by delirium, which was resolved by treatment with cyclophosphamide, in addition to prednisolone concurrent with the improvement of her physical condition. After the meningitis improved, she developed a number of cognitive impairments, including time disorientation, agraphia, acalculia, constitutional apraxia, and personality changes. Simultaneously, we observed, via SPECT, a decrease in cerebral blood flow (CBF) in several regions, including the bilateral frontal, lateral temporal, and parietal regions. This is the first study to report on the CNS manifestations of RP with reference to MRI and SPECT findings.
