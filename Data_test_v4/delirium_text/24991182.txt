24991182|t|A case of neuroleptic malignant syndrome induced by perospirone.
24991182|a|SUMMARY: Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is a rare but life-threatening condition induced by neuroleptic medications. Its main symptoms include the rapid onset of fever, severe extrapyramidal symptoms, autonomic nervous system dysfunction, and impaired consciousness. In severe cases, acute renal failure and circulatory failure can develop, which can rapidly lead to death. In this case report, we discuss the etiology, pathophysiology and management of this condition in a female patient with NMS induced by perospirone. The case highlights the need for clinicians to be vigilant: rapid identification of NMS and vigorous symptomatic treatment of NMS symptoms is the key to decreasing the case-fatality of this rare but serious adverse reaction to antipsychotic medications.
