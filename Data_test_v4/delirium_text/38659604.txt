38659604|t|Nurse anesthetists' perceptions and experiences of managing emergence delirium: A qualitative study.
38659604|a|BACKGROUND: This study employs a descriptive phenomenological approach to investigate the challenges anesthesia nurses face in managing emergence delirium (ED), a common and complex postoperative complication in the post-anesthesia care unit. The role of nurses in managing ED is critical, yet research on their understanding and management strategies for ED is lacking. AIM: To investigate anesthetic nurses' cognition and management experiences of ED in hopes of developing a standardized management protocol. METHODS: This study employed a descriptive phenomenological approach from qualitative research methodologies. Purposeful sampling was utilized to select 12 anesthetic nurses from a tertiary hospital in Shanghai as research subjects. Semi-structured interviews were conducted, and the data were organized and analyzed using Colaizzi's seven-step analysis method, from which the final themes were extracted. RESULTS: After analyzing the interview content, four main themes and eight subthemes were distilled: Inefficient cognition hinders the identification of ED (conceptual ambiguity, empirical identification), managing diversity and challenges (patient-centered safe care, low level of medical-nursing collaboration), work responsibilities and pressure coexist (heavy work responsibilities, occupational risks and stress), demand for high-quality management (expecting the construction of predictive assessment tools and prevention strategies, and pursuing standardized management processes to enhance management effectiveness). CONCLUSION: Nursing managers should prioritize the needs and suggestions of nurses in order to enhance their nursing capabilities and provide guidance for standardized management processes.
