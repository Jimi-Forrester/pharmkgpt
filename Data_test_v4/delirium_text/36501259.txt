36501259|t|Pattern Recognition of Varieties of Peach Fruit and Pulp from Their Volatile Components and Metabolic Profile Using HS-SPME-GC/MS Combined with Multivariable Statistical Analysis.
36501259|a|A fruit's aroma profile, composed of a complex mixture of volatile organic compounds, is among the core attributes related to the overall taste and consumer preference. Prunus persica L. is a preferred summer fruit with a distinct, favorable olfactory characteristic. The volatile compositions of both peach fruits and fruit pulps from eight peach cultivars (four native and four introduced) was investigated to compare their composition and assess flavor-contributing compounds. In total, 65 compounds were profiled after a HS-SPME-GC-MS analysis: 16 esters, 14 aldehydes, 5 alcohols, 7 hydrocarbons, 7 ketones, 8 acids, and 8 terpenes. The most common compounds were esters, acids, and aldehydes. Although the same compounds were identified in both fruit and pulp, their %TIC (total ion current) differed in favor of the whole fruit. Following the metabolic profiling of the whole fruit and fruit pulp, a total of 44 compounds were identified from the studied varieties. Among them, amino acids, organic acids, sugar alcohols, saccharides, fatty acids, and phenolic acids were identified as existing groups. According to the provided principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), the relative %TIC of the identified volatile compounds fluctuated depending on the studied cultivar. No differences were visible in the PCA biplots, which suggested that the polar and lipid metabolites do not provide significant variations when considering different parts of the fruit, contrary to the volatile compounds. The obtained results could successfully be applied in the metabolic chemotaxonomy of peaches and the differentiation of the metabolites present in different parts of the peach.
