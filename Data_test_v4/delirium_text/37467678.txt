37467678|a|OBJECTIVE: Investigate factors associated with a previous outpatient medical consultation (POMC), to the health center or another physician, before attending a hospital emergency department (ED), in patients aged >65 and its impact on the hospitalization rate and variables related to ED stay. SITE: Fifty-two Spanish EDs. PARTICIPANTS: Patients over 65 years consulting an ED. MAIN MEASUREMENTS AND DESIGN: A cohort (n=24645) of patients aged >65 attended for one week in 52 ED. We recorded five sociodemographic variables, six functional, three episode-related severity and analyzed their crude and adjusted association with the existence of a POMC at ED consultation. The primary outcome variable was the need for admission and the secondary variables were complementary examinations and ED stay length. We analyzed whether the POMC influenced these outcomes. RESULTS: 28.5% of the patients had performed a POMC prior to their visit to the ED. Living in a residence, NEWS-2 score >=5, aged >=80, dependency functions, severe comorbidity, living alone, cognitive impairment, male gender and depression were independently associated with a POMC. Also was associated with a greater need for hospitalization and shorter length of stay in the ED. No minor consumption of diagnostic resources in patients with POMC. CONCLUSION: Patients presenting to the ED following POMC are admitted more frequently, suggesting that they are appropriately referred and that minor emergencies are probably effectively resolved in the POMC. Their stay in the ED prior to hospitalization is shorter, so the POMC would facilitate clinical resolution in the ED.
