38100555|t|Cancer drugs with high repositioning potential for Alzheimer's disease.
38100555|a|INTRODUCTION: Despite the recent full FDA approval of lecanemab, there is currently no disease modifying therapy (DMT) that can efficiently slow down the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in the general population. This statement emphasizes the need to identify novel DMTs in the shortest time possible to prevent a global epidemic of AD cases as the world population experiences an increase in lifespan. AREAS COVERED: Here, we review several classes of anti-cancer drugs that have been or are being investigated in Phase II/III clinical trials for AD, including immunomodulatory drugs, RXR agonists, sex hormone therapies, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and monoclonal antibodies. EXPERT OPINION: Given the overall course of brain pathologies during the progression of AD, we express a great enthusiasm for the repositioning of anti-cancer drugs as possible AD DMTs. We anticipate an increasing number of combinatorial therapy strategies to tackle AD symptoms and their underlying pathologies. However, we strongly encourage improvements in clinical trial study designs to better assess target engagement and possible efficacy over sufficient periods of drug exposure.
