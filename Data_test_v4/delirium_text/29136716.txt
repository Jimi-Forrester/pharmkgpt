29136716|a|To investigate the impact of goal directed analgesia on the outcome of patients with mechanical ventilation in intensive care unit.A total of 126 patients who needed mechanical ventilation were recruited.With a method of before and after paired comparison, they were divided into two group: (1) analgesia with empirical administration or control group; (2) goal directed analgesia based on critical-care pain observation tool (CPOT). Compared with the control group, after goal directed analgesia was applied, the consumption of midazolam significantly dropped from (368.47+-27.41) mg to (151.27+-29.31) mg(P<0.05), whereas the consumption of dexmedetomidine significantly increased from (623.62+-20.91) mug to (812.34+-22.57) mug(P<0.05). The median score of Richmond agitation-sedation scale increased from -3 to -1.The incidence of delirium significantly reduced from 23.81% to 17.46%(P<0.05). The mean ventilator duration was significantly shortened from (168.49+-11.41) h to (142.38+-13.24) h(P<0.05). ICU length of stay was significantly shortened from (23.64+-9.26) d to (19.63+-8.46) d(P<0.05). Due to the mild sedation, patients receiving goal directed analgesia report less delirium, less ventilation time and shorter ICU length of stay, suggesting that the general outcome is improved.
