30934561|a|Curcumin, which is a potential antineuroinflammatory and neuroprotective compound, exhibits poor bioavailability in brain cells due to its difficulty in crossing the blood-brain barrier and its rapid metabolism during circulation, which decreases its efficacy in treating chronic neuroinflammatory diseases in the central nervous system. The bioavailability and potential of curcumin can be improved by using a nanodelivery system, which includes solid lipid nanoparticles. Curcumin-loaded solid lipid nanoparticles (SLCN) were efficiently developed to have a particle size of about 86 nm and do not exhibit any toxicity in the endothelial brain cells. Furthermore, the curcumin-loaded solid lipid nanoparticles (SLCN) were studied to assess their efficacy in BV-2 microglial cells against LPS-induced neuroinflammation. The SLCN showed a higher inhibition of nitric oxide (NO) production compared to conventional curcumin in a dose-dependent manner. Similarly, the mRNA and proinflammatory cytokine levels were also reduced in a dose-dependent manner when compared to those with free curcumin. Thus, SLCN could be a potential delivery system for curcumin to treat microglia-mediated neuroinflammation.
