33214968|t|Benzodiazepine Overuse in Elders: Defining the Problem and Potential Solutions.
33214968|a|Objective To determine the prevalence of benzodiazepine use in adults aged 65 and older at two West Virginia academic medical centers as phase one of a benzodiazepine deprescribing strategy.  Design Cross-sectional Setting Two academic hospitals in West Virginia with 107,504 hospitalized adults age 65 and older from the years 2010 to 2018 with information on admission medication use.  Measurements Use of benzodiazepines based on presence on the admission medication list. Demographics, select co-morbidities, and laboratory tests were also recorded.  Results The prevalence of benzodiazepine use was 13.5% and use remained relatively constant with increasing age over 65, even in those over age 89.  Conclusion Efforts aimed at assessing the true need for benzodiazepine use and deprescribing need to be employed, particularly with advancing age.
