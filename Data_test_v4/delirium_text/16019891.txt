16019891|a|To develop a long-acting injectable huperzine A-PLGA microsphere for the chronic therapy of Alzheimer's disease, the microsphere was prepared by using o/w emulsion solvent extraction evaporation method based on a series of formulation design of the emulsion. The dialysis method was used for release analysis. The encapsulation efficiency and release amount of the microspheres were determined by UV/VIS spectrophotometry. The morphology of the microspheres was observed by scanning electron microscopy. The distribution of the drug within microspheres was observed by a confocal laser scanning microscope. The results indicated that the PLGA 15 000 microspheres possessed a smooth and round appearance with average particle size of 50 microm or so. The encapsulation percentages of microspheres prepared from PLGA 15 000, 20 000 and 30 000 were 62.75, 27.52 and 16.63%, respectively. The drug release percentage during the first day decreased from 22.52% of PLGA 30 000 microspheres to 3.97% of PLGA 15 000 microspheres, the complete release could be prolonged to 3 weeks. The initial burst release of microspheres with higher molecular weight PLGA could be explained by the inhomogeneous distribution of drug within microspheres. The encapsulation efficiency of the microspheres improved as the polymer concentration increase in oil phase and PVA concentration decreased in aqueous phase. The burst release could be controlled by reducing the polymer concentration. Evaporation temperature had a large effect on the drug release profiles. It had better be controlled under 30 degrees C. Within a certain range of particle size, encapsulation efficiency decreased and drug release rate increased with the reducing of the particle size.
