23294899|a|INTRODUCTION: alpha7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (alpha7-nAChR) is one of the major neuronal nAChR subtypes. alpha7-nAChR is involved in variety of neuronal processes and disorders including schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease. A number of alpha7-nAChR PET radioligands have been developed, but a quality radiotracer remains to be discovered. METHODS: High binding affinity alpha7-nAChR ligands A-833834 and A-752274 were radiolabeled with (11)C. Baseline and blockade biodistribution studies in the mouse brain of [(11)C]A-833834 (5-(6-(5-[(11)C]methylhexahydropyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrol-2(1H)-yl)pyridazin-3-yl)-1H-indole) and [(11)C]A-752274 (2-(6-[(11)C]methyl-3,6-diazabicyclo[3.2.0]heptan-3-yl)-7-(6-methyl-3,6-diazabicyclo[3.2.0]heptan-3-yl)-9H-fluoren-9-one) were performed. [(11)C]A-752274 was evaluated in a baseline baboon PET study. RESULTS: [(11)C]A-833834 and [(11)C]A-752274 were synthesized by radiomethylation of corresponding des-methyl precursors. The radioligands were prepared with radiochemical yield of 12%-32%, high specific radioactivity (330-403GBq/mumol) and radiochemical purity>95%. Dissection studies with [(11)C]A-833834 demonstrated low specific alpha7-nAChR binding in the mouse brain. [(11)C]A-752274 specifically (~50%) labeled alpha7-nAChR in the mouse thalamus. However, [(11)CA-752274 exhibited low brain uptake in baboon (%SUV<100). CONCLUSION: Two novel alpha7-nAChR ligands radioligands were synthesized and studied in animals. Specific binding of [(11)C]A-833834 in the mouse brain is low due to the insufficient binding affinity of the radioligand. The very high binding affinity [(11)C]A-752274 exhibited good specific binding in the alpha7-nAChR-rich mouse brain regions. The low uptake of [(11)C]A-752274 in the baboon brain is due to its high hydrophilicity, rapid metabolism or other properties. Future development of alpha7-nAChR PET radioligands will be based on compounds with high binding affinities and good blood-brain barrier permeability.
