31517292|t|Mechanism investigation of ethosomes transdermal permeation.
31517292|a|Ethosomes are widely used to promote transdermal permeation of both lipophilic and hydrophilic drugs, but the mechanism of interaction between the ethosomes and the skin remains unclear. In this work, it was exploded with several technologies and facilities. Firstly, physical techniques such as attenuated total reflectance fourier-transform infrared and laser confocal Raman were used and the results indicated that the phospholipids configuration of stratum corneum changes from steady state to unstable state with the treatment of ethosomes. Differential scanning calorimetry reflected the thermodynamics change in stratum corneum after treatment with ethosomes. The results revealed that the skin of Bama mini-pigs, which is similar to human skin, treated by ethosomes had a relatively low Tm and enthalpy. Scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy showed that the microstructure and ultrastructure of stratum corneum was not damaged by ethosomes treatment. Furthermore, confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed that lipid labeled ethosomes could penetrate the skin via stratum corneum mainly through intercellular route, while during the process of penetration, phospholipids were retained in the upper epidermis. Cell experiments confirmed that ethosomes were distributed mainly on the cell membrane. Further study showed that only the drug-loaded ethosomes increased the amount of permeated drug. The current study, for the first time, elucidated the mechanistic behavior of ethosomes in transdermal application from molecular configuration, thermodynamic properties, ultrastructure, fluorescent labeling and cellular study. It is anticipated that the approaches and results described in the present study will benefit for better design of drug-loaded ethosomes.
