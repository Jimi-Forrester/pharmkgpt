37893054|t|Ion Channel Genes in Painful Neuropathies.
37893054|a|Neuropathic pain (NP) is a typical symptom of peripheral nerve disorders, including painful neuropathy. The biological mechanisms that control ion channels are important for many cell activities and are also therapeutic targets. Disruption of the cellular mechanisms that govern ion channel activity can contribute to pain pathophysiology. The voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) is the most researched ion channel in terms of NP; however, VGSC impairment is detected in only <20% of painful neuropathy patients. Here, we discuss the potential role of the other peripheral ion channels involved in sensory signaling (transient receptor potential cation channels), neuronal excitation regulation (potassium channels), involuntary action potential generation (hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channels), thermal pain (anoctamins), pH modulation (acid sensing ion channels), and neurotransmitter release (calcium channels) related to pain and their prospective role as therapeutic targets for painful neuropathy.
