24900185|t|Discovery and Evaluation of BMS-708163, a Potent, Selective and Orally Bioavailable gamma-Secretase Inhibitor.
24900185|a|During the course of our research efforts to develop a potent and selective gamma-secretase inhibitor for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, we investigated a series of carboxamide-substituted sulfonamides. Optimization based on potency, Notch/amyloid-beta precursor protein selectivity, and brain efficacy after oral dosing led to the discovery of 4 (BMS-708163). Compound 4 is a potent inhibitor of gamma-secretase (Abeta40 IC50 = 0.30 nM), demonstrating a 193-fold selectivity against Notch. Oral administration of 4 significantly reduced Abeta40 levels for sustained periods in brain, plasma, and cerebrospinal fluid in rats and dogs.
