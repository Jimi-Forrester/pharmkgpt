27990496|a|Novel, all-oral interferon-free direct-acting antiviral agents have revolutionized the management of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection by producing exceptional cure rates with minimal adverse events. While provocation or exacerbation of autoimmunity has been reported in HCV-infected patients receiving interferon, this phenomenon has not been reported in patients receiving interferon-free HCV therapy. We report the occurrence of three cases of lupus-like immune complex-mediated glomerulonephritis occurring shortly after exposure to sofosbuvir-based direct-acting antiviral therapies. In all three cases, renal function quickly improved with immunosuppression. However, two of the three patients developed infectious complications of immunosuppression and died. This is the first report of a lupus-like immune complex mediated glomerulonephritis occurring in the context of HCV eradication with all-oral direct-acting antiviral therapies.
