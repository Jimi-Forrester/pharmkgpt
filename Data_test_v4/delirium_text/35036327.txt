35036327|t|Severity of coronavirus disease 19: Profile of inflammatory markers and ACE (rs4646994) and ACE2 (rs2285666) gene polymorphisms in Iraqi patients.
35036327|a|Susceptibility to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and disease severity has recently been associated with inflammatory markers and genetic polymorphisms of ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) and ACE2 genes, but the evidence has been inconclusive. This case-control study (99 COVID-19 patients and 96 controls) sought to assess the significance of age, C-reactive protein (CRP), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) in severity of COVID-19. Besides, two variants of ACE and ACE2 genes (rs4646994 and rs2285666, respectively) were analyzed to determine their role in COVID-19 susceptibility and/or disease severity. Results revealed that age, CRP and NLR were significantly elevated in severe cases compared to moderate cases, while RT-PCR Ct value was significantly decreased. Allele and genotypes of both variants were not associated with COVID-19 risk, with the exception of rs2285666 A allele. It showed a significantly higher frequency in female patients than in female controls (probability = 0.041). In conclusion, the study indicated the role of age, CRP, NLR and SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR Ct in susceptibility to COVID-19 severity. However, analysis of the ACE and ACE2 gene variants (rs4646994 and rs2285666, respectively) showed that the two variants were not associated with the risk of developing COVID-19.
