19072910|a|Over the last few years, a large number of preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated the potential of gene therapy applications using adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors. Gene transfer via AAV vectors has been particularly successful for the treatment or adjunct therapy of several CNS disorders. The present review summarizes the progress on AAV gene delivery models for three different CNS disorders. In particular, we discuss advances in AAV-mediated gene transfer strategies in animal models of Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and spinal cord trauma and summarize the results from the first clinical studies using AAV systems.
