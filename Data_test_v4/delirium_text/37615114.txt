37615114|t|Bioactive Isoquinoline Alkaloids with Diverse Skeletons from Fissistigma polyanthum.
37615114|a|Six new isoquinoline alkaloids, including aporphine alkaloids (2, 3, 9, and 10), a benzylisoquinoline alkaloid (13), and a protoberberine alkaloid (17), were isolated from the roots of Fissistigma polyanthum, along with a new furanone (20) and 13 known isoquinoline alkaloids (1, 4-8, 11, 12, 14-16, 18, and 19). The structures of the new compounds were elucidated by the analysis of spectroscopic data. Compounds 1 and 2 are rare oxalyl-fused dehydroaporphine alkaloids. Compound 12 presented the most potent dual-target activities on AChE inhibition and Abeta aggregation inhibition, while compounds 13 and 19 simultaneously exhibited discernible AChE and BChE inhibitions with antioxidant activities. The activity results indicate that F. polyanthum alkaloids have a potential of inhibition and prevention of Alzheimer's disease mainly through both ChEs and beta-amyloid pathways in addition to antioxidant activity.
