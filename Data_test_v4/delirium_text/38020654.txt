38020654|a|Introduction: Multiple sclerosis (MS) affects the cerebral cortex, inducing cortical atrophy and neuronal and synaptic pathology. Despite the fact that women are more susceptible to getting MS, men with MS have worse disability progression. Here, sex differences in neurodegenerative mechanisms are determined in the cerebral cortex using the MS model, chronic experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Methods: Neurons from cerebral cortex tissues of chronic EAE, as well as age-matched healthy control, male and female mice underwent RNA sequencing and gene expression analyses using RiboTag technology. The morphology of mitochondria in neurons of cerebral cortex was assessed using Thy1-CFP-MitoS mice. Oxygen consumption rates were determined using mitochondrial respirometry assays from intact as well as permeabilized synaptosomes. Results: RNA sequencing of neurons in cerebral cortex during chronic EAE in C57BL/6 mice showed robust differential gene expression in male EAE compared to male healthy controls. In contrast, there were few differences in female EAE compared to female healthy controls. The most enriched differential gene expression pathways in male mice during EAE were mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative phosphorylation. Mitochondrial morphology in neurons showed significant abnormalities in the cerebral cortex of EAE males, but not EAE females. Regarding function, synaptosomes isolated from cerebral cortex of male, but not female, EAE mice demonstrated significantly decreased oxygen consumption rates during respirometry assays. Discussion: Cortical neuronal transcriptomics, mitochondrial morphology, and functional respirometry assays in synaptosomes revealed worse neurodegeneration in male EAE mice. This is consistent with worse neurodegeneration in MS men and reveals a model and a target to develop treatments to prevent cortical neurodegeneration and mitigate disability progression in MS men.
