39125316|t|Pain Relief, Functional Recovery, and Chondroprotective Effects of Angelica gigas Nakai in Osteoarthritis Due to Its Anti-Inflammatory Property: An In Vitro and In Vivo Study.
39125316|a|Osteoarthritis (OA), characterized by chronic pain and joint degradation, is a progressive joint disease primarily induced by age-related systemic inflammation. Angelica gigas Nakai (AG), a medicinal plant widely used in East Asia, exhibits promising results for such conditions. This study aimed to evaluate the potential of AG as a drug candidate for modulating the multifaceted pathology of OA based on its anti-inflammatory properties. We evaluated the efficacy of AG in pain relief, functional improvement, and cartilage erosion delay using monosodium iodoacetate-induced OA rats and acetic acid-induced writhing mice, along with its anti-inflammatory effects on multiple targets in the serum and cartilage of in vivo models and lipopolysaccharide-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells. In vivo experiments demonstrated significant analgesic and chondroprotective effects of AG, along with functional recovery, in model animals compared with the active controls. AG dose-dependently modulated inflammatory OA pathology-related targets, including interleukin-1beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, matrix metalloproteinase-13, and cyclooxygenase-2, both in vitro and in vivo. In conclusion, AG could be a potential drug candidate for modulating the multifaceted pathology of OA. Nevertheless, further comprehensive investigations, involving a broader range of compounds, pathologies, and mechanisms, are warranted to validate these findings.
