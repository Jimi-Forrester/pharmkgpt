29865071|t|Endocannabinoid and Muscarinic Signaling Crosstalk in the 3xTg-AD Mouse Model of Alzheimer's Disease.
29865071|a|The endocannabinoid system, which modulates emotional learning and memory through CB1 receptors, has been found to be deregulated in Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD is characterized by a progressive decline in memory associated with selective impairment of cholinergic neurotransmission. The functional interplay of endocannabinoid and muscarinic signaling was analyzed in seven-month-old 3xTg-AD mice following the evaluation of learning and memory of an aversive stimulus. Neurochemical correlates were simultaneously studied with both receptor and functional autoradiography for CB1 and muscarinic receptors, and regulations at the cellular level were depicted by immunofluorescence. 3xTg-AD mice exhibited increased acquisition latencies and impaired memory retention compared to age-matched non-transgenic mice. Neurochemical analyses showed changes in CB1 receptor density and functional coupling of CB1 and muscarinic receptors to Gi/o proteins in several brain areas, highlighting that observed in the basolateral amygdala. The subchronic (seven days) stimulation of the endocannabinoid system following repeated WIN55,212-2 (1 mg/kg) or JZL184 (8 mg/kg) administration induced a CB1 receptor downregulation and CB1-mediated signaling desensitization, normalizing acquisition latencies to control levels. However, the observed modulation of cholinergic neurotransmission in limbic areas did not modify learning and memory outcomes. A CB1 receptor-mediated decrease of GABAergic tone in the basolateral amygdala may be controlling the limbic component of learning and memory in 3xTg-AD mice. CB1 receptor desensitization may be a plausible strategy to improve behavior alterations associated with genetic risk factors for developing AD.
