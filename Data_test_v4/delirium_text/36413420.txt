36413420|t|What a Single Electroencephalographic (EEG) Channel Can Tell us About Alzheimer's Disease Patients With Mild Cognitive Impairment.
36413420|a|Abnormalities in cortical sources of resting-state eyes closed electroencephalographic (rsEEG) rhythms recorded by hospital settings (10-20 montage) with 19 scalp electrodes characterized Alzheimer's disease (AD) from preclinical to dementia stages. An intriguing rsEEG application is the monitoring and evaluation of AD progression in large populations with few electrodes in low-cost devices. Here we evaluated whether the above-mentioned abnormalities can be observed from fewer scalp electrodes in patients with mild cognitive impairment due to AD (ADMCI). Clinical and rsEEG data acquired in hospital settings (10-20 montage) from 75 ADMCI participants and 70 age-, education-, and sex-matched normal elderly controls (Nold) were available in an Italian-Turkish archive (PDWAVES Consortium; www.pdwaves.eu). Standard spectral fast fourier transform (FFT) analysis of rsEEG data for individual delta, theta, and alpha frequency bands was computed from 6 monopolar scalp electrodes to derive bipolar C3-P3, C4-P4, P3-O1, and P4-O2 markers. The ADMCI group showed increased delta and decreased alpha power density at the C3-P3, C4-P4, P3-O1, and P4-O2 bipolar channels compared to the Nold group. Increased theta power density for ADMCI patients was observed only at the C3-P3 bipolar channel. Best classification accuracy between the ADMCI and Nold individuals reached 81% (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) using Alpha2/Theta power density computed at the C3-P3 bipolar channel. Standard rsEEG power density computed from six posterior bipolar channels characterized ADMCI status. These results may pave the way toward diffuse clinical applications in health monitoring of dementia using low-cost EEG systems with a strict number of electrodes in lower- and middle-income countries.
