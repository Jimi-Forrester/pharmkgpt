37537790|t|An association study of cyclase-associated protein 2 and frailty.
37537790|a|Frailty is a geriatric syndrome that results from multisystem impairment caused by age-associated accumulation of deficits. The frailty index is used to define the level of frailty. Several studies have searched for molecular biomarkers associated with frailty, to meet the needs for personalized care. Cyclase-associated protein 2 (CAP2) is a multifunctional actin-binding protein involved in various physiological and pathological processes, that might reflect frailty's intrinsic complexity. This study aimed to investigate the association between frailty index and circulating CAP2 concentration in 467 community-dwelling older adults (median age: 79; range: 65-92 years) from Milan, Italy. The selected robust regression model showed that circulating CAP2 concentration was not associated with chronological age, as well as sex and education. However, circulating CAP2 concentration was significantly and inversely associated with the frailty index: a 0.1-unit increase in frailty index leads to ~0.5-point mean decrease in CAP2 concentration. Furthermore, mean CAP2 concentration was significantly lower in frail participants (i.e., frailty index >=0.25) than in non-frail participants. This study shows the association between serum CAP2 concentration and frailty status for the first time, highlighting the potential of CAP2 as a biomarker for age-associated accumulation of deficits.
