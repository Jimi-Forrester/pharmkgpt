38542673|t|The Influence of High-Dose Parenteral Vitamin C on the Incidence and Severity of Postoperative Pulmonary Complications in Cardiac Surgery with Extracorporeal Circulation: A Randomized Controlled Trial.
38542673|a|Cardiac surgery (CS) with extracorporeal circulation (ECC), induces intense oxidative stress (OS) and systemic inflammatory response (SIR), which may seriously affect postoperative lung function. We aimed to test if high parenteral (200 mg/kg/24 h) daily doses of Vitamin C (VitC), given within 48 h after the beginning of the operation, may reduce the incidence and severity of postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) in CS patients. This single-center, prospective, randomized, single-blinded, interventional trial included 150 patients, assigned to control Group A (n = 75) and interventional Group B (n = 75). Group B intraoperatively received one-fourth (i.e., 50 mg/kg) of the planned daily Vit C dose, divided into three equal parts and diluted in 10 mL of normal saline, while Group A received an equal volume of normal saline at the same time frames (i.e., the induction of anesthesia, aortic cross-clamp release, and sternal closure). After 6 h from the first intraoperative dose, the following regimen was applied: Group B: 50 mg/kg, 30 min i.v. infusion of VitC in 50 mL of normal saline, every 6 h, for the next 48 h, and Group A: 30 min i.v. infusion of an equal volume of normal saline every 6 h, for the next 48 h. Modified Kroenke's score was used to determine the incidence and severity of PPCs. The overall incidence of PPCs was 36.7% and was significantly lower in Group B (13.3% vs. 60.0%, p < 0.001). The PPCs severity score was also significantly lower in Group B (1 vs. 3, p < 0.001). In addition, patients from Group B had significantly less damaged lungs, better postoperative renal function, shorter ICU stays, fewer ICU re-admissions, and lower hospital mortality. No VitC-related adverse effects were recorded. High parenteral daily VitC doses given within 48 h after the beginning of CS are safe and effective in reducing the incidence and severity of PPCs. A multicenter RCT is needed to confirm these results.
