9099177|t|Amyloid beta protein and Alzheimer disease.
9099177|a|Amyloid beta protein is predominant in senile plaques, the neuropathologic hallmarks of Alzheimer disease. Researchers in Winnipeg have shown that this protein can overstimulate certain hydrolytic enzymes to break down the phospholipid building blocks of the brain-cell wall. They speculate that the abnormal destruction of phospholipids gradually drains the energy resources a neuron uses to rebuild its membrane. As neurons "burn out," the brain loses its ability to function normally. In view of evidence that NSAID therapy may interfere with the hydrolysis of phospholipids, the researchers will focus on finding an NSAID-related compound effective against Alzheimer disease.
