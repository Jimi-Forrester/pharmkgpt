19100132|a|INTRODUCTION: Despite its frequency and high clinical burden, few studies have analyzed the clinical features of the alcohol withdrawal syndrome in a hospital setting. Our purpose was to describe its manifestations and clinical course in a general hospital. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with a diagnosis of alcohol withdrawal since January 1983 to December 2003, according to the revised fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders criteria, at the Xeral-Calde General Hospital in Lugo, were studied. Clinical and biochemical data at admission were collected, as well as those referred to the clinical course and complications. RESULTS: 539 episodes in 436 patients were included. Mean age was 45 (standard deviation: 12), and 91,3% were men. Abstinence was the reason for admission in 62,3%. 71,1% had a diagnosis of delirium tremens during their stay. Hallucinations were present in 59,7%, and convulsions (most of them generalized) in 41%. Patients with delirium tremens had greater elevations in temperature, heart rate and blood pressure, as well as more convulsions than minor withdrawal cases. Cirrhosis was present in 10%. The admission rate to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) was 37,8% (95% confidence interval [95%IC]: 33,1-37,8). Of these, 69,9% needed mechanical ventilation. Mortality rate was 6,6% (95%IC: 4,2-9,1). 62% of patients died after admission in the ICU. CONCLUSION: The majority of complications related to the alcohol withdrawal syndrome in a hospital setting develop in patients with delirium tremens. They are especially related to the rate of admissions to the ICU and the use of mechanical ventilation.
