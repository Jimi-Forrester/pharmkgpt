38369449|t|Intraoperative Blood Pressure Management and Its Effects on Postoperative Delirium After Cardiac Surgery: A Single-Center Retrospective Cohort Study.
38369449|a|OBJECTIVES: There is accumulating evidence that blood pressure management might be associated with end-organ dysfunction after cardiac surgery. This study aimed to investigate the impact of intraoperative hypotension (IOH) on adverse neurologic outcomes and mortality. DESIGN: A single-center retrospective cohort study. SETTING: The Heart and Diabetes Centre Bad Oeynhausen NRW, Ruhr-University Bochum. PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study included 31,315 adult patients who underwent elective cardiac surgery at the authors' institution between January 2009 and December 2018. INTERVENTIONS: All cardiac surgery procedures except assist device implantation, organ transplantation, and emergency surgery. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Adverse neurologic outcomes were defined as postoperative delirium and stroke. IOH was defined as mean arterial pressure below 60 mmHg for >2 minutes. The frequency of IOH episodes and the cumulative IOH duration were recorded. The association between IOH and adverse neurologic outcomes was examined with unadjusted statistical analysis and multiple logistic regression analysis. Eight hundred forty-nine (2.9%) patients developed postoperative stroke, and 2,401 (7.7%) patients developed postoperative delirium. The frequency of IOH episodes was independently associated with postoperative delirium in the multiple logistic regression analysis (odds ratio 1.02, 95% CI 1.003-1.03, p < 0.001), whereas there was no association between it and stroke. CONCLUSION: This large retrospective monocentric cohort study revealed that increased episodes of IOH were associated with the risk of developing postoperative delirium after cardiac surgery. This might have important clinical implications with respect to careful and precise hemodynamic monitoring and proactive treatment, especially in patients with increased risk for postoperative delirium.
