30200031|a|Neuropsychiatric sequelae in patients with epilepsy have been vastly studied and documented. These may be affective, cognitive or psychotic. Certain risk factors may predispose some epileptics more to these sequelae. In general, good epileptic control may minimize these outcomes. We present in this report, a case of postictal psychosis (PIP), superimposed on delirium, in a 68-year-old woman, with history of a single previous psychotic illness following a cluster of seizures. This report shows a collaborative management of the neuropsychiatric complications of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), by the neurology, geriatric medicine and psychiatry teams.
