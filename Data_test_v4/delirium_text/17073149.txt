17073149|t|Hexapeptides HLDF-6 and PEDF-6 restore memory in rats after chronic intracerebroventricular treatment with beta-amyloid peptide Abeta(25-35).
17073149|a|Effects of homologous peptides HLDF-6 and PEDF-6 on behavior of animals with experimental Alzheimer's disease induced by chronic intracerebroventricular administration of beta-amyloid peptide Abeta(25-35) were studied in the zoosocial recognition test and Morris water maze. Peptides HLDF-6 and PEDF-6 possessed neuroprotective activity and counteracted the toxic effect of Abeta(25-35). Peptides HLDF-6 and PEDF-6 mainly improved long-term memory and working memory, respectively.
