39227967|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading form of dementia, characterized by the accumulation and aggregation of amyloid in brain. Transient receptor potential vanilloid 2 (TRPV2) is an ion channel involved in diverse physiopathological processes, including microglial phagocytosis. Previous studies suggested that cannabidiol (CBD), an activator of TRPV2, improves microglial amyloid-beta (Abeta) phagocytosis by TRPV2 modulation. However, the molecular mechanism of TRPV2 in microglial Abeta phagocytosis remains unknown. In this study, we aimed to investigate the involvement of TRPV2 channel in microglial Abeta phagocytosis and the underlying mechanisms. Utilizing human datasets, mouse primary neuron and microglia cultures, and AD model mice, to evaluate TRPV2 expression and microglial Abeta phagocytosis in both in vivo and in vitro. TRPV2 was expressed in cortex, hippocampus, and microglia.Cannabidiol (CBD) could activate and sensitize TRPV2 channel. Short-term CBD (1 week) injection intraperitoneally (i.p.) reduced the expression of neuroinflammation and microglial phagocytic receptors, but long-term CBD (3 week) administration (i.p.) induced neuroinflammation and suppressed the expression of microglial phagocytic receptors in APP/PS1 mice. Furthermore, the hyper-sensitivity of TRPV2 channel was mediated by tyrosine phosphorylation at the molecular sites Tyr(338), Tyr(466), and Tyr(520) by protein tyrosine kinase JAK1, and these sites mutation reduced the microglial Abeta phagocytosis partially dependence on its localization. While TRPV2 was palmitoylated at Cys 277 site and blocking TRPV2 palmitoylation improved microglial Abeta phagocytosis. Moreover, it was demonstrated that TRPV2 palmitoylation was dynamically regulated by ZDHHC21. Overall, our findings elucidated the intricate interplay between TRPV2 channel regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation/dephosphorylation and cysteine palmitoylation/depalmitoylation, which had divergent effects on microglial Abeta phagocytosis. These findings provide valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms linking microglial phagocytosis and TRPV2 sensitivity, and offer potential therapeutic strategies for managing AD.
