33757305|t|Quantitative Electroencephalographic Markers of Delirium in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit: Insights From a Heterogenous Convenience Sample.
33757305|a|OBJECTIVE: Little is known about the underlying neurophysiology of pediatric delirium. In adult patients, the sensitivity of EEG to clinical symptoms of delirium has been noted, with a slowing of background activity (alpha) and an increase in slow-wave activity (delta-theta). In this pilot study, the authors extended this investigation to a pediatric cohort. METHODS: In a convenience sample, 23 critically ill children were screened for delirium, using the Cornell Assessment for Pediatric Delirium (CAPD), every 12 hours throughout their pediatric intensive care unit stay as part of standard intensive care unit procedure, and EEGs were performed as part of their clinical care. After hospital discharge, EEGs were reviewed using quantitative analysis, and the maximum delta-alpha ratio (DAR; eyes closed) was derived for each 12-hour period. DAR values were compared between delirious and nondelirious episodes, and the linear relationship between DAR and CAPD was assessed. RESULTS: Higher DARs were associated with episodes of delirium. The DAR also positively correlated with CAPD assessments, with higher DARs relating to higher delirium scores. CONCLUSIONS: Future prospective studies may further investigate this relationship in a more homogeneous and larger sample, and the DAR should be considered to track delirium and assess the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions.
