36721752|a|People often experience cognitive deterioration of various degrees, from early-stage mild cognitive impairment to severe cognitive decline. Cognitive deterioration is related to many diseases and studied to alleviated inflammation reaction or oxidative stress. In the present study, the levels of various memory-related proteins: brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), amyloid beta (Abeta) 42, Abeta40, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha were measured. Among Lactobacillus paracasei HP7 (HP7), Portulaca oleracea Linn. (PO) and HP7 together with PO (HP7A), the HP7A group had the best effect on increasing BDNF expression and suppressing Abeta40 expression. Also, we measured the protective effect on scopolamine-induced cognitive decline in mice. In the acquisition test, the HP7A group most reliably relieved cognitive decline from days 2 to 5 of scopolamine injection. When the probe test was performed on the day 6 of scopolamine injection, the HP7A group had the shortest escape latency. Based on the results of the Morris water maze tasks, we suggest that HP7A is most useful for ameliorating cognitive decline. It is suggested that the HP7A ameliorating scopolamine-induced cognitive decline via the increase of BDNF expression and the suppression of Abeta40 expression.
