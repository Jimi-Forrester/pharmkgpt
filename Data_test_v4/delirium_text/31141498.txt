31141498|t|Efficacy of Total Aortic Arch Replacement Combined with Frozen Elephant Trunk in Aortic Reoperation.
31141498|a|BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to estimate the long-term efficacy of total aortic arch replacement combined with the frozen elephant trunk (TAR+FET) technique for aortic disease following a prior cardiac surgery procedure. MATERIAL AND METHODS We performed TAR+FET for 118 patients for major vessel disease following a prior cardiac procedure with median sternotomy incision. All patients were divided into 5 groups: in group A, the prior major procedure was aortic valve replacement (AVR); in group B, the prior major procedure was isolated ascending aorta replacement; in group C, the prior major procedure was aortic root replacement; in group D, the prior major procedure was aortic arch replacement or intervention; and in group E, the prior major procedure was 'other' cardiac operative procedure. The long-term follow-up visit results were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS The 30-day mortality rate after the operation was 13.6% (16/118) - 2 died in group A, 1 in group B, 8 in group C, 4 in group D, and 1 in group E. Follow-up visits were completed in 99% of patients. The mean follow-up time was 47.6+-36.3 months and 12 patients had died by follow-up, so the total long-term survival rate was 76.3%. One-year survival rates of the 5 groups were 85% (group A), 93.8% (group B), 82.3% (group C), 50% (group D), and 50% (group E), respectively. Five-year survival rates of the 5 groups were 85%, 93.8%, 80.6%, 50%, and 50%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS The TAR+FET technique is feasible and efficacious for aortic reoperation in patients who previously underwent cardiac surgery since the short-term mortality in patients with recurrent aortic arch disease after cardiac surgery is not high.
