35081894|a|Regarding the critical role of amyloid-beta plaques in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, a series of aminoimidazo[1,2-a]pyridine derivatives were designed and synthesized as potential anti-BACE1 agents targeting the production of amyloid-beta plaques. In vitro biological results demonstrated that compounds 7b and 7f exhibited the best inhibitory potency against BACE1 with IC50 values of 22.48 +- 2.06 and 30.61 +- 3.48 muM, respectively. Also, the ligandprotein docking evaluations revealed that compounds 7b and 7f could effectively bind with the different pockets of BACE1 through different interactions with the residue of the active site. The results of current studies underline the potential role of aminoimidazo[1,2-a] pyridine-containing pyrazole derivatives for developing novel BACE1 inhibitors.
