34948414|t|Computer-Based Drug Design of Positive Modulators of Store-Operated Calcium Channels to Prevent Synaptic Dysfunction in Alzheimer's Disease.
34948414|a|Store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) constitutes a fine-tuning mechanism responsible for the replenishment of intracellular stores. Hippocampal SOCE is regulated by store-operated channels (SOC) organized in tripartite complex TRPC6/ORAI2/STIM2. It is suggested that in neurons, SOCE maintains intracellular homeostatic Ca2+ concentration at resting conditions and is needed to support the structure of dendritic spines. Recent evidence suggests that positive modulators of SOC are prospective drug candidates to treat Alzheimer's disease (AD) at early stages. Although STIM2 and ORAI2 are definitely involved in the regulation of nSOC amplitude and a play major role in AD pathogenesis, growing evidence suggest that it is not easy to target these proteins pharmacologically. Existing positive modulators of TRPC6 are unsuitable for drug development due to either bad pharmacokinetics or side effects. Thus, we concentrate the review on perspectives to develop specific nSOC modulators based on available 3D structures of TRPC6, ORAI2, and STIM2. We shortly describe the structural features of existing models and the methods used to prepare them. We provide commonly used steps applied for drug design based on 3D structures of target proteins that might be used to develop novel AD preventing therapy.
