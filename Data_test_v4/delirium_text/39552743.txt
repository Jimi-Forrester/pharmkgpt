39552743|t|Risk Factors and Clinical Outcomes of Perioperative Hypotension in the Neck of Femur Fracture Surgery: A Case-Control and Cohort Analysis.
39552743|a|Introduction Neck-of-femur (NOF) fractures have high prevalence rates and require prompt surgical intervention for better outcomes. Perioperative hypotension (POH) in the geriatric population has poor outcomes with several contributing factors. The study intends to explore these risk factors and their correlation with patient outcomes.  Methodology We studied a total of 276 patients who underwent surgical fixation of the NOF fracture at St Peter's Hospital, Surrey, from June 1, 2022, to June 1, 2023. Patients with POH were identified; the risk factors and one-year outcome were studied to obtain the results. We used odds ratio (OR), relative risk (RR), and multivariate regression to analyse the statistical association within the data. Results The incidence of POH was 68% (188/276) which included preoperative hypotension (9.78%), intraoperative hypotension (48.55%), and postoperative hypotension with a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of <65 mmHg (24.63%) and fall of systolic blood pressure to less than 80% (34.42%). Statistically significant risk factors were hypertension (OR: 1.330), heart disease (OR: 2.768), and hemoglobin (Hg) drop (OR: 1.42). The outcomes we studied were all statistically significant, with an RR of more than one. It includes postoperative delirium (RR: 2.037), postoperative 30-day morbidity (RR: 4.008), postoperative 30-day mortality (RR: 6.12), 365-day mortality (RR: 2.224), postoperative delay in mobilisation (RR: 1.329), and prolonged length of stay (RR: 1.273).  Conclusion The study shows a clear association between POH and increased postoperative complications, highlighting the need for prompt intervention. This case-control study identified hypertension, history of heart disease, and perioperative blood loss as significant risk factors for developing POH. Also, this study demonstrates that POH is significantly associated with adverse outcomes, including the increased risk of delirium, prolonged hospital stays, and elevated 30-day morbidity in elderly patients undergoing hip fracture surgery. The findings also indicated that the duration of hypotension did not directly influence the outcomes; its occurrence alone is a significant factor in developing these complications.
