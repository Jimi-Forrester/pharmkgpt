34064286|t|The Emerging Role of microRNA in Periodontitis: Pathophysiology, Clinical Potential and Future Molecular Perspectives.
34064286|a|During the last few decades, it has been established that messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) transcription does not inevitably lead to protein translation, but there are numerous processes involved in post-transcriptional regulation, which is a continuously developing field of research. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a group of small non-coding RNAs, which negatively regulate protein expression and are implicated in several physiological and pathological mechanisms. Aberrant expression of miRNAs triggers dysregulation of multiple cellular processes involved in innate and adaptive immune responses. For many years, it was thought that miRNAs acted only within the cell in which they were synthesised, but, recently, they have been found outside cells bound to lipids and proteins, or enclosed in extracellular vesicles, namely exosomes. They can circulate throughout the body, transferring information between cells and altering gene expression in the recipient cells, as they can fuse with and be internalised by the recipient cells. Numerous studies on miRNAs have been conducted in order to identify possible biomarkers that can be used in the diagnosis of periodontal disease. However, as therapeutic agents, single miRNAs can target several genes and influence multiple regulatory networks. The aim of this review was to examine the molecular role of miRNAs and exosomes in the pathophysiology of periodontal disease and to evaluate possible clinical and future implications for a personalised therapeutical approach.
