33660556|t|Alzheimer's Dementia: The Emerging Role of Positron Emission Tomography.
33660556|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia and accounts for approximately 50% to 80% of all cases of dementia. The diagnosis of probable AD is based on clinical criteria and overlapping clinical features pose a challenge to accurate diagnosis. However, neuroimaging has been included as a biomarker in various published criteria for the diagnosis of probable AD, in the absence of a confirmatory diagnostic test during life. Advances in neuroimaging techniques and their inclusion in diagnostic and research criteria for the diagnosis of AD includes the use of positron emission tomography (PET) imaging as a biomarker in various therapeutic and prognostic studies in AD. The development and application of a range of PET tracers will allow more detailed assessment of people with AD and will improve diagnostic specificity and targeted therapy of AD. The aim of this review is to summarize current evidence on PET imaging using the non-specific tracer [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose and specific tracers that target amyloid and tau pathology in people with AD.
