35031766|t|Lipogenesis inhibitors: therapeutic opportunities and challenges.
35031766|a|Fatty acids are essential for survival, acting as bioenergetic substrates, structural components and signalling molecules. Given their vital role, cells have evolved mechanisms to generate fatty acids from alternative carbon sources, through a process known as de novo lipogenesis (DNL). Despite the importance of DNL, aberrant upregulation is associated with a wide variety of pathologies. Inhibiting core enzymes of DNL, including citrate/isocitrate carrier (CIC), ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and fatty acid synthase (FAS), represents an attractive therapeutic strategy. Despite challenges related to efficacy, selectivity and safety, several new classes of synthetic DNL inhibitors have entered clinical-stage development and may become the foundation for a new class of therapeutics.
