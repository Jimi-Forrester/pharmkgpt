33958667|a|An evaluation of the APPswe/PS1dE9 transgenic AD mouse, presenting with the toxic Abeta1-42 deposition found in human AD, allowed us to characterize time-dependent changes in inflammatory and cholinergic markers present in AD. Astrogliosis was observed in cortex and hippocampus, with cellular loss occurring in the same areas in which Abeta plaques were present. In this setting, we found early significantly elevated levels of IL-1beta and TNFalpha gene expression; with the hippocampus showing the highest IL-1beta expression. To investigate the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway, the expression of nicotinic receptors (nAChRs) and cholinesterase enzymes also was evaluated. The anti-inflammatory nAChRalpha7, alpha4, and beta2 were particularly increased at 6 months of age in the hippocampus, potentially as a strategy to counteract Abeta deposition and the ensuing inflammatory state. A time-dependent subunit switch to the alpha3beta4 type occurred. Whether alpha3, beta4 subunits have a pro-inflammatory or an inhibitory effect on ACh stimulation remains speculative. Abeta1-42 deposition, neuronal loss and increased astrocytes were detected, and a time-dependent change in components of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway were observed. A greater understanding of time-dependent Abeta/nAChRs interactions may aid in defining new therapeutic strategies and novel molecular targets.
