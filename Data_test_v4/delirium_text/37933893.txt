37933893|a|BACKGROUND: Predominant right temporal atrophy is a radiological sign usually associated with frontotemporal dementia but this sign can also be present in Alzheimer's disease. Given the overlap of clinical symptoms between the two conditions, it is important to know which characteristics allow them to be differentiated. OBJECTIVES: To compare clinical, neuropsychological and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data of subjects with prominent right anterior temporal atrophy, depending on the status of amyloid biomarkers. METHODS: Among patients followed in the dementia center of Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, subjects with right anterior temporal atrophy, defined as grade 3 or 4 on the corresponding visual rating scale, were identified. Only subjects with both an MRI scan and amyloid status available were considered. For selected subjects, data were extracted from clinical and neuropsychological records at initial presentation and at last available follow-up. Two raters applied a protocol of eight visual rating scales to compare brain atrophy and white matter hyperintensities. RESULTS: Of 497 subjects, 17 fulfilled the inclusion criteria: 7 amyloid-positive and 10 amyloid-negative. At initial presentation, executive dysfunction and topographical disorientation were more common in amyloid-positive patients. At follow-up, behavioral symptoms, such as social awkwardness and compulsive attitude, were more frequent in the amyloid-negative patients. Amyloid-positive patients presented an overall worse neuropsychological performance, especially in the language and visuospatial domain, and had higher scores on the right anterior cingulate visual rating scale. CONCLUSION: Patients with predominant right temporal atrophy showed clinical, neuropsychological and radiological differences, depending on the status of amyloid biomarkers.
