37983226|a|In this study, we investigated the role of glutamate delta 1 receptor (GluD1) in oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC)-mediated myelination during basal (development) and pathophysiological (cuprizone-induced demyelination) conditions. Initially, we sought to determine the expression pattern of GluD1 in OPCs and found a significant colocalization of GluD1 puncta with neuron-glial antigen 2 (NG2, OPC marker) in the motor cortex and dorsal striatum. Importantly, we found that the ablation of GluD1 led to an increase in the number of myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG+) cells in the corpus callosum and motor cortex at P40 without affecting the number of NG2+ OPCs, suggesting that GluD1 loss selectively facilitates OPC differentiation rather than proliferation. Further, deletion of GluD1 enhanced myelination in the corpus callosum and motor cortex, as indicated by increased myelin basic protein (MBP) staining at P40, suggesting that GluD1 may play an essential role in the developmental regulation of myelination during the critical window period. In contrast, in cuprizone-induced demyelination, we observed reduced MBP staining in the corpus callosum of GluD1 KO mice. Furthermore, cuprizone-fed GluD1 KO mice showed more robust motor deficits. Collectively, our results demonstrate that GluD1 plays a critical role in OPC regulation and myelination in normal and demyelinating conditions.
