38465828|t|All-cause and cause-specific mortality by spirometric pattern and sex - a population-based cohort study.
38465828|a|BACKGROUND: Chronic airway obstruction (CAO) and restrictive spirometry pattern (RSP) are associated with mortality, but sex-specific patterns of all-cause and specific causes of death have hardly been evaluated. OBJECTIVES: To study the possible sex-dependent differences of all-cause mortality and patterns of cause-specific mortality among men and women with CAO and RSP, respectively, to that of normal lung function (NLF). DESIGN: Population-based prospective cohort study. METHODS: Individuals with CAO [FEV1/vital capacity (VC) < 0.70], RSP [FEV1/VC >= 0.70 and forced vital capacity (FVC) < 80% predicted] and NLF (FEV1/VC >= 0.70 and FVC >= 80% predicted) were identified within the Obstructive Lung Disease in Northern Sweden (OLIN) studies in 2002-2004. Mortality data were collected through April 2016, totally covering 19,000 patient-years. Cox regression and Fine-Gray regression accounting for competing risks were utilized to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) adjusted for age, body mass index, sex, smoking habits and pack-years. RESULTS: The adjusted hazard for all-cause mortality was higher in CAO and RSP than in NLF (HR, 95% CI; 1.69, 1.31-2.02 and 1.24, 1.06-1.71), and the higher hazards were driven by males. CAO had a higher hazard of respiratory and cardiovascular death than NLF (2.68, 1.05-6.82 and 1.40, 1.04-1.90). The hazard of respiratory death was significant in women (3.41, 1.05-11.07) while the hazard of cardiovascular death was significant in men (1.49, 1.01-2.22). In RSP, the higher hazard for respiratory death remained after adjustment (2.68, 1.05-6.82) but not for cardiovascular death (1.11, 0.74-1.66), with a similar pattern in both sexes. CONCLUSION: The higher hazard for all-cause mortality in CAO and RSP than in NLF was male driven. CAO was associated with respiratory death in women and cardiovascular death in men, while RSP is associated with respiratory death, similarly in both sexes.
