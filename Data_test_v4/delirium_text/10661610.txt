10661610|t|Current perspectives on the benefits of HRT in menopausal women.
10661610|a|AIMS: Women in the West can now expect to live one third of their life in a postmenopausal state, and consequently in a state of estrogen deficiency. This can have a number of consequences, and many women suffer vasomotor symptoms during the climacteric. Estrogen deficiency can also result in changes to the skin, hair, urogenital, cardiovascular and skeletal systems. This article reviews some of the main actions of replacement estrogen in postmenopausal women, and discusses the major benefits of estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) and hormone replacement therapy (HRT). REVIEW: HRT is well documented to reduce vasomotor symptoms in women suffering from estrogen deficiency, and can have beneficial effects on the skin and the prevention of skin aging. HRT has beneficial effects on urogenitary function including reductions in urinary incontinence and vaginal atrophy. HRT is used as a first-line treatment to prevent or reverse the development of postmenopausal osteoporosis and can reduce the risk of fractures if taken for 5-10 years from the menopause. In epidemiological studies, ERT was associated with a reduction in the risk of coronary heart disease. Estrogens seem to affect the cardiovascular system directly and indirectly such as reducing some of the coronary risk factors. In recent years, estrogen has been linked to beneficial effects in the CNS including an association with a reduction in the risk of developing Alzheimer's Disease. Despite these benefits, HRT compliance remains low, and physicians need to address this if patients are to gain the benefits.
