36673325|t|Response Surface Methodology Optimization for Analytical Microwave-Assisted Extraction of Resveratrol from Functional Marmalade and Cookies.
36673325|a|A novel analytical method based on microwave-assisted extraction has been successfully optimized and validated to determine resveratrol from functional marmalade and cookies. The optimization was performed using a Box-Behnken design with three factors: solvent composition (60-100% and 10-70% methanol in water for marmalade and cookies, respectively), microwave power (250-750 W), and solvent-to-solid ratio (20:5-60:5). The main and quadratic effects of solvent composition significantly contributed to the recovery values (p < 0.005) for both kinds of samples. Additionally, the solvent-to-solid ratio and the quadratic effect of microwave power also influenced the resveratrol recovery from functional marmalade. Hence, the optimum condition for resveratrol extraction from marmalade (80% methanol, 500 W, solvent-to-solid ratio 40:5) and cookies (80% methanol, 250 W, solvent-to-solid ratio 20:5) was proposed. The extraction kinetics (5-30 min) was then studied to clarify the complete recovery of resveratrol from the food matrices resulting in 15 min as the optimum extraction time. The developed method showed a satisfactory precision indicated by the coefficient of variation (CV) lower than 5.70% for both repeatability and intermediate precision. To check the matrix effects, the developed MAE procedures were applied to a number of commercial marmalade and cookies. The high-fat and fiber cookies resulted in overestimated values due to the interfering ingredients. As a final point, the methods successfully measured the stability of naturally present resveratrol in grape-derived products while preparing functional marmalade and cookies.
