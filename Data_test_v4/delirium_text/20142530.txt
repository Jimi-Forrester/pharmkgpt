20142530|a|BACKGROUND: Abnormal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker levels predict development of Alzheimer disease with good accuracy and are thought to precede cognitive deterioration. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether changes in CSF biomarker levels over time in healthy older adults are associated with a concurrent decline in cognitive performance. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of longitudinal CSF biomarker levels and clinical data. SETTING: A combined academic dementia disorder research center and dementia clinic. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-seven cognitively healthy older volunteers (mean age, 73 years). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Longitudinal CSF total tau protein, hyperphosphorylated tau protein 181, and beta-amyloid(1-42) protein levels and cognitive assessments at baseline and at follow-up 4 years later. RESULTS: Low levels of CSF beta-amyloid(1-42) protein at follow-up were associated with decreased delayed word recall score on the Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (r(s) = -0.437, P < .01) and with slower results on A Quick Test of Cognitive Speed (r(s) = -0.540, P < .001). Individuals with a decrease during the 4-year study of 15% or more in CSF beta-amyloid(1-42) protein level performed worse on the Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale delayed word recall (z = -2.18, P < .05) and A Quick Test of Cognitive Speed (z = -2.35, P < .05) at follow-up. An increase over time of 20% or more in CSF hyperphosphorylated tau protein 181 level correlated with slower results on A Quick Test of Cognitive Speed at follow-up (z = -2.13, P < .05). Furthermore, the presence of the APOE-epsilon4 (OMIM 107741) allele was associated with a greater longitudinal decrease in CSF beta-amyloid(1-42) protein level (chi(2) = 10.47, P < .05) and with a higher CSF total tau protein level at follow-up (chi(2) = 8.83, P < .05). No correlation existed between baseline CSF biomarker levels and baseline or follow-up cognitive scores. CONCLUSIONS: In this group of healthy older adults, changes in CSF biomarker levels previously associated with Alzheimer disease correlated with a decline in cognitive functions. Changes in CSF biomarker levels may identify early neurodegenerative processes of Alzheimer disease.
