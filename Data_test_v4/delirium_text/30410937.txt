30410937|t|The Correlations of Plasma and Cerebrospinal Fluid Amyloid-Beta Levels with Platelet Count in Patients with Alzheimer's Disease.
30410937|a|PURPOSE: Recent study shows that blood-derived amyloid-beta (Abeta) can induce cerebral amyloidosis and is involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The vast majority of blood Abeta is generated from platelet. Whether blood Abeta levels are associated with the count of platelets remains unknown. METHODS: 58 clinically diagnosed AD patients, 18 11C-PIB-PET diagnosed AD patients, and 61 age- and gender-matched cognitively normal controls were included to analyze the correlation of plasma Abeta levels with platelet count. 13 AD patients and 40 controls with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were included to further analyze the correlation of CSF Abeta levels with platelet count. Abeta40 and Abeta42 levels in plasma and CSF were measured by ELISA kits. RESULTS: The plasma Abeta42 level was positively correlated with platelet count in both AD patients and control group, especially in AD patients with positive PIB-PET, while there was no correlation as to Abeta40. The CSF Abeta levels also had no significant correlation with platelet count. CONCLUSION: It suggests that platelets may be involved in the pathogenesis of AD and become a potential peripheral biomarker for AD.
