33672391|t|Mind the Gap: Mitochondria and the Endoplasmic Reticulum in Neurodegenerative Diseases.
33672391|a|The way organelles are viewed by cell biologists is quickly changing. For many years, these cellular entities were thought to be unique and singular structures that performed specific roles. However, in recent decades, researchers have discovered that organelles are dynamic and form physical contacts. In addition, organelle interactions modulate several vital biological functions, and the dysregulation of these contacts is involved in cell dysfunction and different pathologies, including neurodegenerative diseases. Mitochondria-ER contact sites (MERCS) are among the most extensively studied and understood juxtapositioned interorganelle structures. In this review, we summarise the major biological and ultrastructural dysfunctions of MERCS in neurodegeneration, with a particular focus on Alzheimer's disease as well as Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia. We also propose an updated version of the MERCS hypothesis in Alzheimer's disease based on new findings. Finally, we discuss the possibility of MERCS being used as possible drug targets to halt cell death and neurodegeneration.
