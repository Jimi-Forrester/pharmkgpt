32012676|t|Microglial Activation in the Retina of a Triple-Transgenic Alzheimer's Disease Mouse Model (3xTg-AD).
32012676|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia in the world. The main biomarkers associated with AD are protein amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques and protein tau neurofibrillary tangles, which are responsible for brain neuroinflammation mediated by microglial cells. Increasing evidence has shown that the retina can also be affected in AD, presenting some molecular and cellular changes in the brain, such as microglia activation. However, there are only a few studies assessing such changes in the retinal microglia in animal models of AD. These studies use retinal sections, which have some limitations. In this study, we performed, for the first time in a triple-transgenic AD mouse model (3xTg-AD), a quantitative morphometric analysis of microglia activation (using the anti-Iba-1 antibody) in retinal whole-mounts, allowing visualization of the entire microglial cell, as well as its localization along the extension of the retina in different layers. Compared to age-matched animals, the retina of 3xTg-AD mice presents a higher number of microglial cells and a thicker microglial cell body area. Moreover, the microglia migrate, reorient, and retract their processes, changing their localization from a parallel to a perpendicular position relative to the retinal surface. These findings demonstrate clear microglia remodeling in the retina of 3xTg-AD mice.
