38341814|a|PURPOSE: It is the first study to evaluate the predictive value of the geriatric nutritional risk index (GNRI) on postoperative delirium (POD) after transforaminal lumber interbody fusion (TLIF) in elderly patients with degenerative lumbar diseases. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted to assess the outcomes of TLIF surgery in elderly patients with lumbar degenerative disease between the years 2016 and 2022. Delirium was diagnosed by reviewing postoperative medical records during hospitalization, utilizing the Confusion Assessment Method. The geriatric nutritional risk index was calculated using the baseline serum albumin level and body weight. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was employed to identify the association between preoperative GNRI and postoperative delirium (POD). Additionally, a receiver operating characteristic curve was utilized to determine the optimal GNRI cutoff for predicting POD. RESULTS: POD was observed in 50 of the 324 patients. The GNRI was visibly reduced in the delirium group. The mean GNRI was 93.0 +- 9.1 in non-delirium group and 101.2 +- 8.2 in delirium group. On multivariate logistic regression, Risk of POD increases significantly with low GNRI and was an independent factor in predicting POD following TLIF (OR 0.714; 95% CI 0.540-0.944; p = 0.018). On receiver operating characteristic curve, the area under curve (AUC) for GNRI was 0.738 (95% CI 0.660-0.817). The cutoff value for GNRI according to the Youden index was 96.370 (sensitivity: 66.0%, specificity: 70.4%). CONCLUSION: Our study indicated that lower GNRI correlated significantly with POD after TLIF. Performing GNRI evaluation prior to TLIF may be an effective approach of predicting the risk for POD among elderly patients with degenerative lumbar diseases.
