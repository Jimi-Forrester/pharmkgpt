15712160|a|INTRODUCTION: Recent studies indicate that decreased energy generation by mitochondria is a feature that is common across neurodegenerative diseases. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In order to obtain direct evidence that mitochondrial functioning is altered, we measured the hydrolytic activity of F0F1-ATPase and its capacity to generate a stable proton gradient in submitochondrial particles in 29 patients diagnosed with probable Alzheimer's disease (AD). Submitochondrial particles were obtained from platelets of patients with a diagnosis of probable AD and from clinically healthy controls. RESULTS: Data revealed that the hydrolytic activity of F0F1-ATPase increases significantly in patients with probable AD (41.7+/-4.3 nmol PO4 min-1[mg protein]-1, n=29) as compared to the control subjects (29.1+/-1.9 nmol PO4 min-1 [mg protein]-1, n=29). It is important to note that, in the male population with probable AD, we found that hydrolytic activity of F0F1-ATPase increased as cerebral deterioration progressed. We also detected a lower pH gradient in the submitochondrial particles of patients with probable AD (0.28+/-0.08 pH units, n=25) as compared to the controls (0.5+/-0.1 pH units, n=20). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these data point to an alteration in the functioning of the enzyme.
