6160732|t|Blood-brain barrier selectivity and synaptic turnover during delirium tremens and related clinical states. A study of brain and blood proteins in the cerebrospinal fluid.
6160732|a|The synaptic membrane protein D2 was measured in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from patients with delirium tremens and related clinical states immediately after admission to the hospital before treatment was initiated and again after recovery. during this period of on average 5 days duration the concentration of D2 increased to double normal value possible indicating increased breakdown of old synapses during the process of readaptation to the alcohol free state. IgG, albumin and alpha 2-macroglobulin were measured in plasma and in CSF and the results indicated a decreased selectivity of blood-CSF-barrier permeability to proteins in the clinically recovered patients; this was probably due to increased micropinocytotic activity also occurring during readaptation to the alcohol free state.
