36803536|a|BACKGROUND: Garlic is one of the favorite herbs in traditional medicine that has been reported to have many medicinal features. The aim of the current study is to review the latest documents on the effect of garlic on diabetes, VEGF, and BDNF and, finally, to review the existing studies on the effect of garlic on diabetic retinopathy. MAIN TEXT: The therapeutic effect of garlic on diabetes has been investigated in various studies. Diabetes, especially in advanced stages, is associated with complications such as diabetic retinopathy, which is caused by the alteration in the expression of molecular factors involved in angiogenesis, neurodegeneration, and inflammation in the retina. There are different in-vitro and in-vivo reports on the effect of garlic on each of these processes. Considering the present concept, we extracted the most related English articles from Web of Science, PubMed, and Scopus English databases from 1980 to 2022. All in-vitro and animal studies, clinical trials, research studies, and review articles in this area were assessed and classified. RESULT AND CONCLUSION: According to previous studies, garlic has been confirmed to have beneficial antidiabetic, antiangiogenesis, and neuroprotective effects. Along with the available clinical evidence, it seems that garlic can be suggested as a complementary treatment option alongside common treatments for patients with diabetic retinopathy. However, more detailed clinical studies are needed in this field.
