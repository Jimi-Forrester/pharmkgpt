37030503|t|Rapid, scalable assay of amylin-beta amyloid co-aggregation in brain tissue and blood.
37030503|a|Islet amyloid polypeptide (amylin) secreted from the pancreas crosses from the blood to the brain parenchyma and forms cerebral mixed amylin-beta amyloid (Abeta) plaques in persons with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Cerebral amylin-Abeta plaques are found in both sporadic and early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, the role of amylin-Abeta co-aggregation in potential mechanisms underlying this association remains unknown, in part due to lack of assays for detection of these complexes. Here, we report the development of an ELISA to detect amylin-Abeta hetero-oligomers in brain tissue and blood. The amylin-Abeta ELISA relies on a monoclonal anti-Abeta middomain antibody (detection) and a polyclonal anti-amylin antibody (capture) designed to recognize an epitope that is distinct from the high affinity amylin-Abeta binding sites. The utility of this assay is supported by analysis of molecular amylin-Abeta co-deposition in post-mortem brain tissue obtained from persons with and without AD pathology. By using transgenic AD-model rats, we show that this new assay can detect circulating amylin-Abeta hetero-oligomers in the blood and is sensitive to their dissociation to monomers. This is important because therapeutic strategies to block amylin-Abeta co-aggregation could reduce or delay the development and progression of AD.
