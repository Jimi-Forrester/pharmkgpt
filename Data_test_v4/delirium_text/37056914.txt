37056914|t|COVID-19 delirium and encephalopathy: Pathophysiology assumed in the first 3 years of the ongoing pandemic.
37056914|a|Background: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) continues to spread worldwide. It has a high rate of delirium, even in young patients without comorbidities. Infected patients required isolation because of the high infectivity and virulence of COVID-19. The high prevalence of delirium in COVID-19 primarily results from encephalopathy and neuroinflammation caused by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)-associated cytokine storm. Acute respiratory distress syndrome has been linked to delirium and psychotic symptoms in the subacute phase (4 to 12 weeks), termed post-acute COVID-19 syndrome (PACS), and to brain fog, cognitive dysfunction, and fatigue, termed "long COVID," which persists beyond 12 weeks. However, no review article that mentions "COVID-19 delirium" have never been reported. Basic Procedures: This narrative review summarizes data on delirium associated with acute severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and related neurological symptoms of persistent post-infection illness (PACS or long COVID) after persistence of cognitive dysfunction. Thus, we describe the pathophysiological hypothesis of COVID-19 delirium and its continuation as long COVID. This review also describes the treatment of delirium complicated by COVID-19 pneumonia. Main Findings: SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with encephalopathy and delirium. An association between COVID-19 infection and Alzheimer's disease has been suggested, and studies are being conducted from multiple facets including genetics, cytology, and postmortem study. Principal Conclusions: This review suggests that COVID-19 has important short and long-term neuropsychiatric effects. Several hypotheses have been proposed that highlight potential neurobiological mechanisms as causal factors, including neuronal-inflammatory pathways by cytokine storm and cellular senescence, and chronic inflammation.
