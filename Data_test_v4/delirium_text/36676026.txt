36676026|t|Potential Properties of Natural Nutraceuticals and Antioxidants in Age-Related Eye Disorders.
36676026|a|Eye health is crucial, and the onset of diseases can reduce vision and affect the quality of life of patients. The main causes of progressive and irreversible vision loss include various pathologies, such as cataracts, ocular atrophy, corneal opacity, age-related macular degeneration, uncorrected refractive error, posterior capsular opacification, uveitis, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, retinal detachment, undetermined disease and other disorders involving oxidative stress and inflammation. The eyes are constantly exposed to the external environment and, for this reason, must be protected from damage from the outside. Many drugs, including cortisonics and antinflammatory drugs have widely been used to counteract eye disorders. However, recent advances have been obtained via supplementation with natural antioxidants and nutraceuticals for patients. In particular, evidence has accumulated that polyphenols (mostly deriving from Citrus Bergamia) represent a reliable source of antioxidants able to counteract oxidative stress accompanying early stages of eye diseases. Luteolin in particular has been found to protect photoreceptors, thereby improving vision in many disease states. Moreover, a consistent anti-inflammatory response was found to occur when curcumin is used alone or in combination with other nutraceuticals. Additionally, Coenzyme Q10 has been demonstrated to produce a consistent effect in reducing ocular pressure, thereby leading to protection in patients undergoing glaucoma. Finally, both grape seed extract, rich in anthocyanosides, and polynsatured fatty acids seem to contribute to the prevention of retinal disorders. Thus, a combination of nutraceuticals and antioxidants may represent the right solution for a multi-action activity in eye protection, in association with current drug therapies, and this will be of potential interest in early stages of eye disorders.
