37488107|a|Toxic protein aggregates can spread among neurons to promote human neurodegenerative disease pathology. We found that in C. elegans touch neurons intermediate filament proteins IFD-1 and IFD-2 associate with aggresome-like organelles and are required cell-autonomously for efficient production of neuronal exophers, giant vesicles that can carry aggregates away from the neuron of origin. The C. elegans aggresome-like organelles we identified are juxtanuclear, HttPolyQ aggregate-enriched, and dependent upon orthologs of mammalian aggresome adaptor proteins, dynein motors, and microtubule integrity for localized aggregate collection. These key hallmarks indicate that conserved mechanisms drive aggresome formation. Furthermore, we found that human neurofilament light chain (NFL) can substitute for C. elegans IFD-2 in promoting exopher extrusion. Taken together, our results suggest a conserved influence of intermediate filament association with aggresomes and neuronal extrusions that eject potentially toxic material. Our findings expand understanding of neuronal proteostasis and suggest implications for neurodegenerative disease progression.
