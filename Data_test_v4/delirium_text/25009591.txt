25009591|a|Localized deposits of amyloid structures are observed in various pathological conditions. One example of when local amyloidosis occurs is following repeated insulin injections in diabetic patients. The present study aimed to simulate the same condition in mice. To obtain the amyloid structures, regular insulin was incubated at 57 C for 24 h. The subsequently formed amyloid fibrils were analyzed using the Congo red absorbance test, as well as transmission electron microscopy images, and then injected into mice once per day for 21 consecutive days. Firm waxy masses were developed following this period, which were excised, prepared as thin sections and stained with hematoxylin and eosin, Congo red and Sudan black. Histological examination revealed that these masses contained adipose cells and connective tissue, in which amyloid deposition was visible. Thus, localized amyloidosis was obtained by the subcutaneous injection of insulin fibrils. The present results may be of further use in the development of models of amyloid tumors.
