8774944|a|The low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) is a multifunctional cell surface receptor that binds to the protease inhibitor alpha 2-macroglobulin (alpha 2 M). LRP has also been identified as the apolipoprotein E (apoE) receptor that mediates lipid metabolism. Recently it has been reported that apoE4, one of three common isoforms of apoE, is a main risk factor of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Moreover, all three of these proteins are reported to accumulate in the senile plaques in the brains of Alzheimer's patients. To understand the roles of LRP in the normal development of the central nervous system (CNS) and in the pathogenesis of AD, we studied the developmental expression and localization of LRP mRNA in the CNS. We used Northern blot analysis to investigate the developmental profile of LRP mRNA in the rat brain. LRP mRNA was first detected as early as in 18-day-old embryonic rat brain and was continuously expressed thereafter. A particularly high level of expression of the mRNA was observed in the perinatal stage. We also determined the cellular distribution of LRP mRNA in the CNS of 20-day-old embryonic and 6-week-old adult rat brains by in situ hybridization using a digoxigenin-labeled antisense riboprobe to LRP mRNA. In the embryonic rat brain, LRP mRNA was highly expressed in most of the cells, mainly neurons and glial cells. In the adult rat, LRP mRNA was expressed mostly in neurons in both the brain and the spinal cord. These results suggest that LRP plays crucial roles in development of the brain.
