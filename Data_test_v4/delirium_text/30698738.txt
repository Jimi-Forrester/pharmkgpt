30698738|t|Early neurophysiological biomarkers and spinal cord pathology in inherited prion disease.
30698738|a|A common presentation of inherited prion disease is Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome, typically presenting with gait ataxia and painful dysaesthesiae in the legs evolving over 2-5 years. The most frequent molecular genetic diagnosis is a P102L mutation of the prion protein gene (PRNP). There is no explanation for why this clinical syndrome is so distinct from Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and biomarkers of the early stages of disease have not been developed. Here we aimed, first, at determining if quantitative neurophysiological assessments could predict clinical diagnosis or disability and monitor progression and, second, to determine the neuropathological basis of the initial clinical and neurophysiological findings. We investigated subjects known to carry the P102L mutation in the longitudinal observational UK National Prion Monitoring Cohort study, with serial assessments of clinical features, peripheral nerve conduction, H and F components, threshold tracking and histamine flare and itch response and neuropathological examination in some of those who died. Twenty-three subjects were studied over a period of up to 12 years, including 65 neurophysiological assessments at the same department. Six were symptomatic throughout and six became symptomatic during the study. Neurophysiological abnormalities were restricted to the lower limbs. In symptomatic patients around the time of, or shortly after, symptom onset the H-reflex was lost. Lower limb thermal thresholds were at floor/ceiling in some at presentation, in others thresholds progressively deteriorated. Itch sensation to histamine injection was lost in most symptomatic patients. In six patients with initial assessments in the asymptomatic stage of the disease, a progressive deterioration in the ability to detect warm temperatures in the feet was observed prior to clinical diagnosis and the onset of disability. All of these six patients developed objective abnormalities of either warm or cold sensation prior to the onset of significant symptoms or clinical diagnosis. Autopsy examination in five patients (including two not followed clinically) showed prion protein in the substantia gelatinosa, spinothalamic tracts, posterior columns and nuclei and in the neuropil surrounding anterior horn cells. In conclusion, sensory symptoms and loss of reflexes in Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome can be explained by neuropathological changes in the spinal cord. We conclude that the sensory symptoms and loss of lower limb reflexes in Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome is due to pathology in the caudal spinal cord. Neuro-physiological measures become abnormal around the time of symptom onset, prior to diagnosis, and may be of value for improved early diagnosis and for recruitment and monitoring of progression in clinical trials.
