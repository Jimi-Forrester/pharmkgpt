37926948|a|BACKGROUND: Parkin RBR E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase (PRKN) mutations are the most common cause of young onset and autosomal recessive Parkinson's disease (PD). PRKN is located in FRA6E, which is one of the common fragile sites in the human genome, making this region prone to structural variants. However, complex structural variants such as inversions of PRKN are seldom reported, suggesting that there are potentially unrevealed complex pathogenic PRKN structural variants. OBJECTIVES: To identify complex structural variants in PRKN using long-read sequencing. METHODS: We investigated the genetic cause of monozygotic twins presenting with a young onset dystonia-parkinsonism using targeted sequencing, whole exome sequencing, multiple ligation probe amplification, and long-read sequencing. We assessed the presence and frequency of complex inversions overlapping PRKN using whole-genome sequencing data of Accelerating Medicines Partnership Parkinson's disease (AMP-PD) and United Kingdom (UK)-Biobank datasets. RESULTS: Multiple ligation probe amplification identified a heterozygous exon three deletion in PRKN and long-read sequencing identified a large novel inversion spanning over 7 Mb, including a large part of the coding DNA sequence of PRKN. We could diagnose the affected subjects as compound heterozygous carriers of PRKN. We analyzed whole genome sequencing data of 43,538 participants of the UK-Biobank and 4941 participants of the AMP-PD datasets. Nine inversions in the UK-Biobank and two in AMP PD were identified and were considered potentially damaging and likely to affect PRKN expression. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report describing a large 7 Mb inversion involving breakpoints outside of PRKN. This study highlights the importance of using long-read sequencing for structural variant analysis in unresolved young-onset PD cases.   2023 The Authors.
