12417453|a|Two robust findings in the Alzheimer's literature are that patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) show executive function and primacy deficits. The present study examined whether we would find similar deficits when comparing two groups of middle-aged individuals who differed with respect to genetic risk for AD, based on their apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype. All individuals were screened as normal on a battery of standardized cognitive measures. They were tested on the "Operation span task", which engages the central executive component of working memory [J. Exp. Psychol.: Gen. 128 (1999) 309, J. Exp. Psychol.: Gen. 126 (1997) 211, J. Mem. Language 39 (1998) 418] by dividing attention between processing math operations and remembering words. Individuals were grouped according to APOE genotype ( epsilon 4 carrier versus epsilon 4 non-carrier), matched on age and education, and their Total span and Primacy scores were compared. Despite having no overt symptoms of dementia or deficits on a series of standardized psychometric tests, the epsilon 4 carriers showed divided-attention and primacy deficits on the Operation span task, when compared to the epsilon 4 non-carriers. As a point of comparison, Primacy scores were extracted from the first trial of the "Buschke selective reminding task" [J. Verbal Learn. Verbal Behav. 12 (1973) 543] for these same individuals, and no group differences were found. The Buschke task is a list-learning task that does not require divided attention. These findings suggested that the epsilon 4 carriers were less able to divide their attention, when compared to the epsilon 4 non-carriers. The findings provide the first direct evidence for a relationship between APOE genotype and cognitive performance on measures of divided attention and primacy with non-demented individuals who showed no cognitive impairments on standardized measures.
