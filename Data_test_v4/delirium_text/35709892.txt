35709892|t|Identification of potential therapeutic and diagnostic characteristics of Alzheimer disease by targeting the miR-132-3p/FOXO3a-PPM1F axis in APP/PS1 mice.
35709892|a|Alzheimer disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder, which is characterized by progressive impairment of memory and cognition. Early diagnosis and treatment of AD has become a leading topic of research. In this study, we explored the effects of the miR-132-3p/FOXO3a-PPM1F axis on the onset of AD for possible early diagnosis and therapy. We found that miR-132-3p levels in the hippocampus and blood were drastically decreased in APP/PS1 mice from 9 months of age, and bi-directional manipulation of miR-132-3p levels induced magnified effects on learning memory behaviors, and manifestation of AD-related pathological characteristics and inflammatory cytokines in APP/PS1 mice of relevant ages. The hippocampal PPM1F expression levels were significantly elevated in APP/PS1 mice from 3 months of age, which was correlated with miR-132-3p levels at different ages. Overexpression of PPM1F remarkably accelerated the progression of learning memory deficits and associated pathological factors in APP/PS1 mice. Further, we showed that miR-132-3p modulated the expression of PPM1F via FOXO3a in HT22 cells. Finally, using peripheral blood samples of human study participants, we found that the miR-132-3p and PPM1F expression levels in patients with AD were also altered with prominent correlations. In conclusion, miR-132-3p indirectly regulates PPM1F expression by targeting FOXO3a, which could play an extensive role in contributing to the establishment of early diagnosis, treatment, and pathogenesis of AD.
