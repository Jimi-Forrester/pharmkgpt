38825641|a|The effects of ultraviolet (UV) radiation on brain function have previously been investigated; however, the specific neurotransmitter-mediated mechanisms responsible for UV radiation-induced neurobehavioral changes remain elusive. In this study, we aimed to explore the mechanisms underlying UV radiation-induced neurobehavioral changes. In a mouse model, we observed that UV irradiation of the skin induces deficits in hippocampal memory, synaptic plasticity, and adult neurogenesis, as well as increased dopamine levels in the skin, adrenal glands, and brain. Chronic UV exposure altered the expression of genes involved in dopaminergic neuron differentiation. Furthermore, chronic peripheral dopamine treatments resulted in memory deficits. Systemic administration of a dopamine D1/D5 receptor antagonist reversed changes in memory, synaptic plasticity, adult neurogenesis, and gene expression in UV-irradiated mice. Our findings provide converging evidence that chronic UV exposure alters dopamine levels in the central nervous system and peripheral organs, including the skin, which may underlie the observed neurobehavioral shifts, such as hippocampal memory deficits and impaired neurogenesis. This study underscores the importance of protection from UV exposure and introduces the potential of pharmacological approaches targeting dopamine receptors to counteract the adverse neurological impacts of UV exposure.
