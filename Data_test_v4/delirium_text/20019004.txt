20019004|a|We present the case of a middle-aged defendant who had been incarcerated in a county jail and housed on the mental health unit. It was documented that he had been exhibiting fluctuating levels of alertness and responsiveness. The writers saw him in a forensic capacity, to conduct an evaluation of his competence to stand trial, and recognized that he was having a medical emergency, delirium that was most likely due to brain metastases from inoperable advanced cancer. We recommended an immediate transfer to a medical facility for treatment. The article serves to present an interesting case and to highlight the need for clinical vigilance despite the usual goal of an objective, noninterfering forensic role.
