38256304|t|Monitored Anesthesia Care in Minimally Invasive Spine Surgery-A Retrospective Case Series Study.
38256304|a|Background and Objectives: Minimally invasive spine surgery (MISS) under monitored anesthesia care (MAC) has emerged as a treatment modality for spinal radiculopathy. It is essential to secure the airway and guarantee spontaneous respiration without endotracheal intubation during MISS in a prone position. Materials and Methods: To evaluate the feasibility and safety of MAC with dexmedetomidine during MISS, we retrospectively reviewed clinical cases. A retrospective review of medical records was conducted between September 2015 and June 2016. A total of 17 patients undergoing MISS were included. Vital signs were analyzed every 15 min. The depth of sedation was assessed using the bispectral index (BIS) and the frequency of rescue sedatives. Adverse events during anesthesia, including bradycardia, hypotension, respiratory depression, postoperative nausea, and vomiting, were evaluated. Results: All cases were completed without the occurrence of airway-related complications. None of the patients needed conversion to general anesthesia. The median maintenance dosage of dexmedetomidine for adequate sedation was 0.40 (IQR 0.40-0.60) mcg/kg/hr with a median loading dose of 0.70 (IQR 0.67-0.82) mcg/kg. The mean BIS during the main procedure was 76.46 +- 10.75. Rescue sedatives were administered in four cases (23.6%) with a mean of 1.5 mg intravenous midazolam. After dexmedetomidine administration, hypotension and bradycardia developed in six (35.3%) and three (17.6%) of the seventeen patients, respectively. Conclusions: MAC using dexmedetomidine is a feasible anesthetic method for MISS in a prone position. Hypotension and bradycardia should be monitored carefully during dexmedetomidine administration.
