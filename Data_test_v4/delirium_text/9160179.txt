9160179|a|Medical and neuropsychiatric sequelae of HIV infection present a spectrum of diagnostic and treatment challenges to mental health clinicians. Both HIV and the many opportunistic infections that manifest in patients due to their immunocompromised state also can affect the central nervous system (CNS). Thus, mental health clinicians need to be familiar with the diagnosis and management of HIV-related medical and psychiatric complications. This article provides an overview of the CNS-related manifestations resulting from HIV disease, including HIV-related dementia, psychotic disorders, delirium, CNS opportunistic infections and tumors, systemic abnormalities, psychoactive substances, and the adverse effects of certain medical treatments. Treatment strategies for individuals with HIV disease and comorbid severe mental illness are outlined and recommendations for future research are offered.
