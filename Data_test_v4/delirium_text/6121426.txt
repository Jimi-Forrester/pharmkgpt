6121426|t|Diagnosis and treatment of dementia in the aged.
6121426|a|Dementia affects an estimated 5 percent of the population 65 years of age and older, with 20 percent being affected at 75 years or older. Although the most common forms, primary degenerative and multi-infarct dementia, currently lack specific treatments, it is estimated that a thorough diagnostic evaluation will uncover a treatable cause in 10 percent to 20 percent. The differential diagnosis includes benign senescent forgetfulness, depression, adjustment disorder, paranoid states, amnestic syndrome, delirium, drug effects, systemic illnesses and intracranial conditions. The approach to each patient involves a history, physical examination, mental status evaluation and laboratory tests that focus on identifying treatable conditions. When no specific treatments are available, however, symptomatic treatments, including pharmacotherapy, environmental management, family supports and psychotherapy, can offer relief for both patients and their families and improve the daily functioning of the elderly patient with dementia.
