15607232|a|A number of studies indicate that free radicals are involved in the neurodegeneration in Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. EPS2, an exopolysaccharide with a mean molecular weight of 1.3 x 10(5) Da, was isolated by ion-exchange and sizing chromatography from the culture of Keissleriella sp. YS4108, a marine filamentous fungus. Compositionally, it is composed of galactose, glucose, rhamnose, mannose and glucuronic acid in an approximate proportion of 50:8:1:1:0.4. The protective effects of EPS2 on peroxide hydrogen (H2O2)-induced cell lesion, level of lipid peroxidation, antioxidant enzyme activities were investigated in the rat pheochromocytoma line PC12 cells. Following a 1-h exposure of the cells to H2O2, a significant reduction in cell survival and activities of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and catalase (CAT), as well as increased levels in malondialdehyde (MDA) production and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release were observed. However, preincubation of the cells with EPS2 prior to H2O2 exposure elevated the cell survival and GSH-Px and CAT activities, and decreased the level of MDA and LDH activity in a dose-dependent manner. In conclusion, EPS2 possesses pronounced protective effects against H2O2-induced cell toxicity. The finding is of a higher value in searching for new therapeutic agent for treating oxidative damage-derived neurodegenerative disorders.
