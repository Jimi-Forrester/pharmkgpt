31158394|t|Protein phosphatase 2A as a therapeutic target in inflammation and neurodegeneration.
31158394|a|Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a highly complex heterotrimeric enzyme that catalyzes the selective removal of phosphate groups from protein serine and threonine residues. Emerging evidence suggests that it functions as a tumor suppressor by constraining phosphorylation-dependent signalling pathways that regulate cellular transformation and metastasis. Therefore, PP2A-activating drugs (PADs) are being actively sought and investigated as potential novel anti-cancer treatments. Here we explore the concept that PP2A also constrains inflammatory responses through its inhibitory effects on various signalling pathways, suggesting that PADs may be effective in the treatment of inflammation-mediated pathologies.
