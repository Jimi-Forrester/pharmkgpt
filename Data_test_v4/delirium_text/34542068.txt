34542068|a|BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to high mortality rates in nursing homes (NHs) in Europe. For adequate risk management and good prognostications, it is essential to identify mortality risk factors. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine whether previously identified risk factors for 30-day mortality in Dutch NH residents with COVID-19 are unique to COVID-19. METHODS: In this cohort study, we included 1,294 NH residents with COVID-19 (cases) and 17,999 NH residents without COVID-19 (controls, from the pre-COVID-19 period). We used descriptive statistics and Cox proportional hazard models to compare mortality rates in residents with and without COVID-19, categorized by risk factors. RESULTS: Cases had a more than 18 times higher hazard of death within 30 days compared to controls (HR 18, 95%CI: 16-20). For residents with COVID-19, being male, having dementia, and having Parkinson's disease (PD) were all associated with a higher 30-day mortality (HR 1.8 versus 1.3 versus 1.7). Being male was also associated with a higher mortality (HR 1.7) in the control group, whereas having dementia and PD were not. COVID-19 symptomatology was very similar for residents with and without dementia or PD, except for delirium and malaise which was more frequent in residents with dementia. CONCLUSION: Dementia and PD were significant additional risk factors for mortality in Dutch NH residents with COVID-19, whereas male gender was not unique to residents with COVID-19. The frailty of PD and dementia in NH residents with COVID-19 are relevant to consider in prognostication, communication, and care planning with residents and their families.
