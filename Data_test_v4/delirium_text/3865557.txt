3865557|t|Postoperative delirium secondary to atropine premedication.
3865557|a|Anticholinergic agents used as preoperative medications have the ability to induce postanesthetic delirium reactions. We present a case of postanesthetic delirium secondary to premedication with atropine which was treated with intravenous physostigmine. This case is presented to alert the clinician to the possibility of this reaction occurring with the use of atropine, and to demonstrate the use of physostigmine in reversing postanesthetic delirium reactions caused by anticholinergics.
