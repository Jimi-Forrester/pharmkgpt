35600965|t|Cisapride versus Maren Pill for Functional Constipation: A Meta-Analysis.
35600965|a|Background: The efficacy and safety of cisapride in functional constipation (FC) remain unclear. This meta-analysis aimed at investigating the efficacy and safety of cisapride and Maren pill in the treatment of FC. Material and Methods. PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane Library, WANFANG DATA, VIP, and CNKI databases were searched from inception to December 2021 for eligible comparative studies investigating the effects and safety of cisapride and Maren pill for FC. The primary outcome was the therapeutic effectiveness rate. The secondary outcomes were recurrence rate and incidence of adverse events. Results: A total of 526 studies were screened out by searching the electronic databases and by manually searching the relevant reference lists. According to the four-step process (identification, screening, eligibility, and inclusion) to select studies for meta-analysis, 521 articles were excluded. Finally, 5 studies with a total of 414 patients with FC were included in the quantitative analysis after sequential exclusion. The cisapride group had a significantly higher effectiveness rate than the control one (90.78% vs 64.97%, P < 0.05). The incidence of adverse events in the cisapride group was lower than that in the Maren pill group (10.08% vs 13.95%, P < 0.05). Similarly, the recurrence rate of the cisapride group was lower than that of the Maren pill group (32.31% vs 53.16%, P < 0.05). Conclusion: For FC patients, cisapride is more effective than Maren pill; the recurrence rate and adverse event rate are lower than the latter, which makes it a better choice. The combination of cisapride and Maren pill is a direction of future research studies, which may increase the efficiency and reduce the dosage of cisapride.
