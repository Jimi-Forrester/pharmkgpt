34113728|t|Reversible splenial lesion syndrome in sisters with sensorineural deafness as the first manifestation.
34113728|a|Reversible splenial lesion syndrome (RESLES) is a rare clinico-radiological disorder syndrome with unclear pathophysiology. Here, two sisters with sensorineural deafness as the chief complaint diagnosed with RESLES was reported. Although the sisters had the disease successively, they were divided into two types on imaging by isolated lesions of splenium of the corpus callosum (SCC) and extensive lesions of the corpus callosum. The clinical manifestations and lesions on MRI disappeared after 6 months. The sensorineural deafness of the sisters in this article may be caused by transcallosal auditory pathway (TCAP) injury. Auditory handicap has been found in previous RESLES cases, indicating that we know little about the connection between the SCC and the auditory pathway, and further research is needed.
