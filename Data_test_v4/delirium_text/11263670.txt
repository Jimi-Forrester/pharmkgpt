11263670|t|Paradoxical effects of copper and manganese on brain mitochondrial function.
11263670|a|Defects in the mitochondrial genome have been associated with Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease, and apoptosis can be triggered by the presence of energetically compromised mitochondria. Thus, in this study we have examined whether the divalent cations Cu2+ and Mn2+ could influence mitochondrial function in vitro. Mitochondrial electron transport was dose and time dependently reduced by Cu2+ to a greater extent with succinate as a substrate. Following a 60 min preincubation period, Mn2+ dose dependently inhibited electron transport to a greater extent with lactate and malate. In contrast, paradoxical effects were seen following a 5 min preincubation period with Mn2+. Cu2+ dose-dependently reduced NADH-dependent lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity, with almost complete inhibition apparent at 10 microM. An initial induction of LDH by 10 microM Mn2+ was partially reversed by higher concentrations of the metal. Cu2+ dose-dependently reduced flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)-dependent monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) activity in a time-independent manner, with an IC50 value approximately 20 microM, whereas Mn2+ had no effect. In conclusion, it is proposed that Cu2+ and Mn2+ have differential effects on nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and FAD-dependent mitochondrial enzymes at the level of the essential cofactors. Cu2+ appears to exert an inhibitory effect on both NAD and FAD-dependent enzymes, but predominantly against the latter, including MAO-A and succinate dehydrogenase. The complex responses to Mn2+ may be due to dose-related effects on the interconversion of NAD and NADH and reversible enzymatic reactions employing this nucleotide cofactor.
