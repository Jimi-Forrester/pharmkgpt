32604855|t|Clinical Detection of Chronic Rhinosinusitis through Next-Generation Sequencing of the Oral Microbiota.
32604855|a|Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is the chronic inflammation of the sinus cavities of the upper respiratory tract, which can be caused by a disrupted microbiome. However, the role of the oral microbiome in CRS is not well understood. Polymicrobial and anaerobic infections of CRS frequently increased the difficulty of cultured and antibiotic therapy. This study aimed to elucidate the patterns and clinical feasibility of the oral microbiome in CRS diagnosis. Matched saliva and nasal swabs were collected from 18 CRS patients and 37 saliva specimens from normal volunteers were collected for 16S rRNA sequencing. The alpha-diversity of the saliva displayed no significant difference between control and CRS patients, whereas the beta-diversity was significantly different (p = 0.004). Taxonomic indices demonstrated that Veillonella dispar, Rothia mucilaginosa, and Porphyromonas endodontalis were enriched, while Campylobacter and Cardiobacterium were reduced in the saliva of CRS patients. These microbial markers could significantly distinguish CRS patients from control (AUC = 0.939). It is noted that the 16S rRNA results of the nasal swab were consistent with the nasopharynx aerobic culture, and additionally detected multiple pathogens in CRS patients. In summary, these results indicated these oral microbiomes may provide a novel signal for CRS detection and that NGS may be an alternative approach for CRS diagnosis.
