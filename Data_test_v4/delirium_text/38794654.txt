38794654|t|Pharmacodynamic Evaluation and Mechanism of Ginseng Polysaccharide against Nephrotoxicity Induced by Hexavalent Chromium.
38794654|a|Hexavalent chromium is a common pollutant in the environment. Long-term exposure to hexavalent chromium can cause damage to multiple organs. The kidney is one of the main organs that metabolizes heavy metal toxicity, and the accumulation of Cr (VI) in the body can lead to serious damage to kidney function. Studies have shown that ginseng polysaccharides have the function of preventing cisplatin-induced endoplasmic reticulum stress, inflammatory response, and apoptosis in renal cells, but their efficacy and mechanisms against hexavalent chromium-induced nephrotoxicity need to be explored. The aim of this study was to explore the efficacy and mechanism of ginseng polysaccharide against hexavalent chromium-induced nephrotoxicity. The results of pharmacodynamic experiments showed that ginseng polysaccharide could significantly reduce the kidney index, urea nitrogen (BUN), and serum creatinine (Cre) values of K2Cr2O7-treated mice. The results of mechanistic experiments showed that ginseng polysaccharides could alleviate oxidative stress, apoptosis, and biofilm damage in renal tissues caused by Cr (VI). Lipidomic correlation analysis showed that ginseng polysaccharides could protect the organism by regulating the expression of differential lipids. This study opens new avenues for the development of alternative strategies for the prevention of kidney injury caused by hexavalent chromium.
