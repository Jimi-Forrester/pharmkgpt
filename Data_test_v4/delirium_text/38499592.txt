38499592|t|Switch of innate to adaptative immune responses in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease correlates with tauopathy progression.
38499592|a|Neuroinflammation is a key feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this work, analysis of single- cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data obtained from the brain of patients with AD provides evidence supporting a switch from an innate to an adaptative immune response during tauopathy progression, with both disease-associated microglia (DAM) and CD8+ T cells becoming more frequent at advanced Braak stages.
