35237460|a|BACKGROUND: Postoperative delirium (POD) is a serious and common complication of intertrochanteric fracture (IF). However, the risk factors for POD remain debated. The purpose of this study was to explore risk factors for POD after IF surgery in elderly patients by age-stratified analysis. METHODS: A total of 2307 patients who underwent IF surgery in our hospital between Jan. 2017 and Nov. 2020 were included. 128 patients suffering from POD were regarded as the delirium group (DG) and the other patients as the normal group (NG). Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted. RESULTS: In our study, the occurrence of POD after IF surgery in elderly patients was 5.55% (128 of 2307). The results of univariate and multivariate analysis showed that advanced age and patients with a history of dementia were identified as the risk factors for POD. Age-stratified analysis showed different comorbidities influencing POD at different stages of age. Additionally, POD markedly increased along with age. Moreover, compared with younger than 70 years in male patients and younger than 80 years in female patients, patients over the age of 70 for males and over the age of 80 for females had a higher rate of POD. CONCLUSIONS: Advanced age and patients with a history of dementia were independent risks of delirium after IF surgery in both univariate and multivariate analyses. 70 years old in male patients and 80 years old in female patients may be the cut-off values for a significantly increased rate of POD. Preoperative measures should be taken to lower the incidence of POD. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Prognostic Level III.
