33714271|a|BACKGROUND: Reliable prediction of the preoperative risk is of crucial importance for patients undergoing aortic repair. In this retrospective cohort study, we evaluated the metabolic equivalent of task (MET) in the preoperative risk assessment with clinical outcome in a cohort of consecutive patients. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data in a single center unit of 296 patients undergoing open or endovascular aortic repair from 2009 to 2016. The patients were divided into four anatomic main groups (infrarenal (endo: n = 94; open: n = 88), juxta- and para-renal (open n = 84), thoraco-abdominal (open n = 13) and thoracic (endo: n = 11; open: n = 6). Out of these, 276 patients had a preoperative statement of their functional capacity in metabolic units and were evaluated concerning their postoperative outcome including survival, in-hospital mortality, postoperative complications, myocardial infarction and stroke, and the need of later cardiovascular interventions. RESULTS: The median follow-up of the cohort was 10.8 months. Patients with < 4MET had a higher incidence of diabetes mellitus (p = 0.0002), peripheral arterial disease (p < 0.0001), history of smoking (p = 0.003), obesity (p = 0.03) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (p = 0.05). Overall in-hospital mortality was 4.4% (13 patients). There was no significant difference in the survival between patients with a functional capacity of more than 4 MET (220 patients, mean survival: 74.5 months) and patients with less than 4 MET (56 patients, mean survival: 65.4 months) (p = 0.64). The mean survival of the infrarenal cohort (n = 169) was 74.3 months with no significant differences between both MET groups (> 4 MET: 131 patients, mean survival 75.5 months; < 4 MET: 38 patients, mean survival 63.6 months. p = 0.35). The subgroup after open surgical technique with less than 4 MET had the lowest mean survival of 38.8 months. In 46 patients with > 4MET (20.9%) perioperative complications occurred compared to the group with < 4MET with 18 patients (32.1%) (p = 0.075). There were no significant differences in both groups in the late cardiovascular interventions (p = 0.91) and major events including stroke and myocardial infarction (p = 0.4) monitored during the follow up period. The risk to miss a potential need for cardiac optimization in patients > 4MET was 7%. CONCLUSION: The functional preoperative evaluation by MET in patients undergoing aortic surgery is a useful surrogate marker of perioperative performance but cannot be seen as a substitute for preoperative cardiopulmonary testing in selected individuals.
