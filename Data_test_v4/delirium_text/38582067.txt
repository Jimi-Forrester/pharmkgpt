38582067|t|High-flow nasal cannula therapy versus conventional oxygen therapy for adult patients after cardiac surgery: A systemic review and meta-analysis.
38582067|a|BACKGROUND: Oxygen therapy constitutes a crucial element of post-cardiac operative care. The study assessed the effectiveness of high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) in comparison to conventional oxygen therapy (COT). OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to assess the effectiveness of HFNC in comparison to COT for adult patients following cardiac surgery. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive search of Embase, PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases from inception until April 18, 2023, to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and crossover studies that compared the efficacy of HFNC with COT in adult patients following cardiac surgery. RESULTS: The meta-analysis included nine studies, consisting of eight RCTs and one crossover study. Compared with COT, HFNC could reduce the need for escalation of respiratory support (RR 0.67, 95% CI: 0.48 to 0.93, P = 0.02), decrease arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) levels (MD -3.14, 95% CI: -4.90 to -1.39, P<0.001), and increase forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) levels (MD 0.08, 95% CI: 0.02 to 0.15, P = 0.02). There was no significant difference between the HFNC and COT groups in terms of mortality, intubation rate, respiratory rate, heart rate, intensive care unit and hospital length of stay, arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2), forced vital capacity, and complications of atrial fibrillation and delirium. CONCLUSION: Compared with COT, HFNC could decrease the need for escalation of respiratory support, lower PaCO2 levels, and elevate FEV1 levels in patients following cardiac surgery.
