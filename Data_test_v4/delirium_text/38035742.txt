38035742|t|Efficacy and safety of the Chaixiong Qiwei granule for tension-type headache: study protocol for a randomised controlled trial.
38035742|a|INTRODUCTION: Tension-type headache (TTH) is the most prevalent headache disorder worldwide. Although current treatments for TTH are beneficial, they are not without adverse effects. Chaixiong Qiwei granule (CXQW) is an experienced prescription medicine for TTH management. This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of CXQW for the treatment of TTH. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study will be a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. A total of 148 eligible participants will be divided into the intervention (CXQW treatment) and control (placebo treatment) groups. The primary outcome will be the reduction in the number of headache days (headache-days reduction) within 9-12 weeks after randomisation, while secondary outcomes will include the number of headache days, headache intensity, responder rate, drug consumption for acute treatment, quality of life and symptoms related to traditional Chinese medicine use based on a symptom-observation table. This protocol describes the design of the randomised controlled trial. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study design was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Human Research at Xiyuan Hospital, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences (No. 2020XLA030-2). TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ChiCTR2100042514.
