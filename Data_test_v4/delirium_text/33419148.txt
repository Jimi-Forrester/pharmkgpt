33419148|t|Ferroptosis-Related Genes in Neurodevelopment and Central Nervous System.
33419148|a|Ferroptosis, first introduced as a new form of regulated cell death induced by erastin, is accompanied by the accumulation of iron and lipid peroxides, thus it can be inhibited either by iron chelators or by lipophilic antioxidants. In the past decade, multiple studies have introduced the potential importance of ferroptosis in many human diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we will discuss the genetic association of ferroptosis with neurological disorders and development of the central nervous system.
