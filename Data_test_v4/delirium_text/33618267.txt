33618267|a|Entorhinal cortex (EC) is one of the first cerebral regions affected in the early phase of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Soluble forms of amyloid beta (Abeta) impair synaptic transmission in experimental AD models. Protein kinase Mzeta (PKMzeta) is an atypical persistently active protein kinase C, known to maintain long term synaptic plasticity and memory, but its role in AD has not yet been described. We examined effect of PKMzeta overexpression on the late long-term potentiation (L-LTP) in the dentate gyrus (DG) following EC amyloidopathy. Oligomeric Abeta 1-42 (oAbeta) or vehicle was bilaterally microinjected into the EC of the male Wistar rats. After 1 week, 2 microL of lentiviral vector (~108 TU/mL) encoding PKMzeta genome was injected into the DG. One week later, synaptic responses and the LTP persistence were assessed in DG of freely moving animals during 90 minutes to 7 days period. Novel object recognition, passive avoidance and spatial memories were also tested. In rats with EC amyloidopathy, LTP was induced with less amplitude compared to the control group, and extinguished after 24 h. PKMzeta overexpression in DG augmented synaptic responses (PS-LTP amplitudes) and maintained LTP over 1 week. PKMzeta ameliorated recognition and memory deficits in rats with EC amyloidopathy. Microinjection of PKMzeta inhibitor, zeta inhibitory peptide, into the DG abolished the boosting effect of PKMzeta on synaptic activity and memory performance. PKMzeta-dependent pathway could be a potential therapeutic target to combat synaptic failure and memory deficit in the early phase of AD.
