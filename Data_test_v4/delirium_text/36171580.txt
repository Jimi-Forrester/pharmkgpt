36171580|a|BACKGROUND: To evaluate the risk factors of postoperative delirium (POD) in elderly gastric cancer (GC) patients after laparoscopic gastrectomy and construct a predictive model. METHODS: Elderly GC patients undergoing laparoscopic gastrectomy were enrolled and grouped based on the status of POD development within postoperative 7 days. Independent risk factors were selected out by univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses and then enrolled in the nomogram prediction model. RESULTS: A total of 270 elderly GC patients were enrolled, and POD occurred in 74 (27.4%) patients within postoperative 7 days. The results of multivariate regression analysis indicated that age (OR: 3.30, 95% CI: 1.41-6.85, P < 0.001), sleeping pills (OR: 1.87, 95% CI: 1.12-3.09, P = 0.012), duration of ICU stay (OR: 1.55, 95% CI: 1.02-2.37, P = 0.029), albumin/fibrinogen ratio (AFR) (OR: 1.74, 95% CI: 1.03-2.76, P = 0.019), and neutrophils/lymphocytes ratio (NLR) (OR: 2.12, 95% CI: 1.11-4.01, P = 0.016) were five independent risk factors for POD in elderly GC patients. The AUC of the constructed nomogram model based on these five factors was 0.807. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlighted that age, AFR, NLR, sleeping pills taking, and duration of ICU stay were independent risk factors for POD, and the nomogram model based on these factors could effectively predict POD in elderly GC patients.
