37164926|t|Signal mining and analysis for central nervous system adverse events due to taking oxycodone based on FAERS database.
37164926|a|OBJECTIVES: Central nervous system adverse events (AEs) occur when oxycodone is used in combination with benzodiazepines, antidepressants and anticonvulsants. There have been no reports of central nervous system AEs with oxycodone alone or in combination with oxycodone. Based on USA Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) data, this study aims to explore the risk signals of central nervous system AEs with oxycodone alone or in combination with benzodiazepines, antidepressants and anticonvulsants, and to provide a reference for the safe and rational use of this drug. METHODS: Extracted AEs data from the FAERS for oxycodone alone and in combination with benzodiazepines, antidepressants, and anticonvulsants from Q1 2004 to Q2 2021. The risk signal mining analysis of AEs was performed using the proportional imbalance method and Bayesian method. Number of reports >=3 and lower 95% CI limit of reporting odds ratio (ROR)>1; number of reports >=3, proportional reporting ratio (PRR)>=2 and chi2>=4; lower information components (IC) lower 95% CI limit (IC025)>0; empirical Bayes geometric mean (EBGM) lower 95% CI limit (EBGM05)>2, and N>0 were defined as positive signals. RESULTS: A total of 5 793 reports of central nervous system AEs with oxycodone alone were tapped, and 366, 622, and 740 reports of combined benzodiazepines, antidepressants, and anticonvulsants, respectively. Consumers and physicians were the main reporting population. The age distribution of oxycodone alone was mainly from 61 to 80 years old. The age distribution of oxycodone in combination with related drugs was mainly from 46 to 60 years old. The risk of AEs was greater in women than in men, and the United States was the predominant reporting country. Oxycodone alone was strongly associated with myoclonus [ROR=2.92, 95% CI 2.28 to 3.76); PRR=2.92, chi2(77.49); IC=1.52, IC025(0.65); EBGM=2.89, EBGM05(2.33)], delirium [ROR=4.69, 95% CI 4.24 to 5.21; PRR=4.66, chi2(1 052.64); IC=2.17, IC025(1.81); EBGM=4.50, EBGM05 (4.13)], mental disorder [ROR=2.95, 95% CI 2.53 to 3.44; PRR=2.94, chi2(206.93); IC=1.56, IC025(0.96); EBGM=2.95, EBGM05(2.58)], and acute central respiratory depression [ROR=2.87, 95% CI 2.68 to 3.08); PRR=2.82, chi2(971.62); IC=1.52, IC025(1.33), EBGM=2.87, EBGM05 (2.76)]. Combination of benzodiazepines was most strongly associated with mental disorder [ROR=10.08, 95% CI 9.38 to 10.78; PRR=9.90, chi2(64.06); IC=3.33, IC025 (1.65); EBGM=10.08, EBGM05(5.61)], and tremor [ROR=3.09, 95% CI 2.76 to 3.42); PRR=3.08, chi2(48.93); IC=1.63, IC025 (1.17); EBGM=3.09, EBGM05(2.34)]. Combination of antidepressants was most strongly associated with delirium [ROR=13.23, 95% CI 12.23 to 14.23; PRR=12.87, chi2(43.86); IC=3.69, IC025(1.36); EBGM=12.23, EBGM05 (5.32)] and somnolence [ROR=6.74, 95% CI 6.15 to 7.33); PRR=6.73, chi2(53.42); IC=2.75, IC025(1.52); EBGM=6.73, EBGM05(4.10)]. Combination of anticonvulsants was most strongly associated with myoclonus [ROR=17.89, 95% CI 17.46 to 18.32; PRR=17.72, chi2(971.39); IC=4.16, IC025(2.70); EBGM=17.89, EBGM05(12.46)] and delirium [ROR=4.86, 95% CI 4.45 to 5.27); PRR=4.82, chi2(69.49); IC=2.28, IC025 (1.51); EBGM=4.86, EBGM05(3.44)]. CONCLUSIONS: Based on pharmacovigilance studies of the FAERS database, clinical medication monitoring of oxycodone alone and in combination with benzodiazepines, antidepressants, and anticonvulsants should be strengthened to be alert to the occurrence of central nervous system-related AEs.
