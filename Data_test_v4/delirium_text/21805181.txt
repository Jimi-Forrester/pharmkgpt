21805181|t|Factors affecting Abeta plasma levels and their utility as biomarkers in ADNI.
21805181|a|Previous studies of Abeta plasma as a biomarker for Alzheimer's disease (AD) obtained conflicting results. We here included 715 subjects with baseline Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(1-42) plasma measurement (50% with 4 serial annual measurements): 205 cognitively normal controls (CN), 348 patients mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 162 with AD. We assessed the factors that modified their concentrations and correlated these values with PIB PET, MRI and tau and Abeta(1-42) measures in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Association between Abeta and diagnosis (baseline and prospective) was assessed. A number of health conditions were associated with altered concentrations of plasma Abeta. The effect of age differed according to AD stage. Plasma Abeta(1-42) showed mild correlation with other biomarkers of Abeta pathology and were associated with infarctions in MRI. Longitudinal measurements of Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(1-42) plasma levels showed modest value as a prognostic factor for clinical progression. Our longitudinal study of complementary measures of Abeta pathology (PIB, CSF and plasma Abeta) and other biomarkers in a cohort with an extensive neuropsychological battery is significant because it shows that plasma Abeta measurements have limited value for disease classification and modest value as prognostic factors over the 3-year follow-up. However, with longer follow-up, within subject plasma Abeta measurements could be used as a simple and minimally invasive screen to identify those at increased risk for AD. Our study emphasizes the need for a better understanding of the biology and dynamics of plasma Abeta as well as the need for longer term studies to determine the clinical utility of measuring plasma Abeta.
