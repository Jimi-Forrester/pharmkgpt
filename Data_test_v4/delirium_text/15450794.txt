15450794|t|A static laser light scattering assay for surfactant-induced tau fibrillization.
15450794|a|Static light scattering is an important solution-based method for assaying spontaneous protein aggregation reactions. But the reliability of the measurements when conducted in the presence of fibrillization inducers has been questioned. Here the utility of static laser light scattering for quantitative assay of anionic micelle-induced protein fibrillization was characterized using tau protein, the major component of neurofibrillary lesions of Alzheimer's disease. Both inducer micellization and tau fibrillization made significant contributions to light scattering intensity. The intensity arising solely from micellization was quantified using proteins that promoted inducer micellization but could not fibrillize, such as mixed histones and assembly-incompetent mutant htau40(I277P/I308P). When corrected for micellization, reaction progress curves for wild-type tau fibrillization were sigmoidal and correlated well with measurements of total filament length made by transmission electron microscopy. The utility of the improved laser light scattering assay was demonstrated by quantifying the effect of inducer concentration on tau assembly kinetics using a three-parameter Gompertz growth function. Results showed that alkyl sulfate detergent accelerated tau nucleation as reflected by shorter lag times and modulated pre-nuclear equilibria to yield more filament mass at reaction equilibrium.
