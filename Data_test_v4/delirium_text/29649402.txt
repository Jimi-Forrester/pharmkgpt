29649402|t|End-of-Life Treatments in Pediatric Patients at a Government Tertiary Cancer Center in India.
29649402|a|AIM: The primary objective of this study was to describe demographics and end-of-life treatments of children with cancer at a government tertiary cancer center in India. METHODS: A retrospective review was undertaken of medical charts of all children younger than 18 years, who died as inpatients while undergoing treatment at the pediatric oncology department between April and September 2016. Data were collected on demographics, diagnosis, treatments, survival, palliative care involvement, and symptoms at end of life. RESULTS: There were 44 pediatric oncology patients who died in the hospital during the study period. The most frequent diagnoses were hematological malignancies (n = 29). Tumor-specific treatment was given to 38/44 (86%) patients in the last 30 days of life, and 13 patients in the last day of life or 1 day before. Of all deaths, 23/44 (52%) occurred within 30 days of admission to the pediatric ward and 34/44 (77%) within 90 days. Of the 44 patients, 25 (57%) were referred to palliative care. The median number of days between referral and death was 14 (0-78) days. Frequent symptoms documented were bleeding (11/44), dyspnea (10/44), pain (7/44), seizures (7/44), and delirium (5/44), with each patient having one or more of these symptoms. Only patients with a palliative care referral received opioid analgesics or benzodiazepines at the end of life. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the demographics of suffering, death, and end-of-life care in children with cancer at a government tertiary cancer center in India.
