37992573|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) stands as the predominant age-related neurodegenerative disorder, for which efficacious treatment remains elusive. An auspicious avenue for this disease lies in natural compounds sourced from tranditional medicine and plant origins. Parthenolide (PTN) is a natural product with multiple biological functionsand. Recent investigations have illuminated PTN's protective properties against neurological maladies; however, its potential therapeutic role against AD remains uncharted. This study aims to explore the role of PTN in treating AD. Our in vitro findings underscore PTN's bioactivity, as evidenced by its capacity to curtail apoptosis, reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and restore mitochondrial membrane potential in PC12 cells. Moreover, PTN treatment demonstrates a capacity to ameliorate deficits in spatial learning and memory in the 3 xTg-AD murine model. Notably, PTN's therapeutic efficacy surpasses that of a clinical agent, donepezil. Mechanistically, PTN's neuroprotective effects stem from its adept regulation of the AMPK/GSK3beta(ser9)/Nrf2 signaling pathway and protection on neuronal cells from ROS-related apoptosis. Although the molecular target and the pre-clinical evaluations of PTN need to be further explored, this study indicates PTN as a potential agent or lead compound for the drug development against AD.
