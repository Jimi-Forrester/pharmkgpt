38585502|a|Changes in the connections between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria, as well as alterations in mitochondria-associated ER membrane (MAM) signalling, have been documented in various neurodegenerative diseases affecting the brain. Despite the growing recognition of the significance of the gut-brain axis in neurodegenerative conditions, there has been no prior investigation into the biology of MAM within the enteric nervous system (ENS). Our recent research reveals, for the first time, the existence of connections between the ER and mitochondria within enteric neurons. Additionally, we observed alterations in the dynamics of these connections in the enteric neurons from a mouse model exhibiting age-related neurodegeneration. These findings provide the first detailed characterization of MAM in the ENS under physiological conditions and in a mouse model of age-associated neurodegeneration and shed new light on the potential role of enteric MAM in the context of neurodegenerative disorders.
