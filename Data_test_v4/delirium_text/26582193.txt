26582193|t|Genoprotective and neuroprotective effects of Daphne gnidium leaf methanol extract, tested on male mice.
26582193|a|Methanol extract of Daphne gnidium leaves was assessed for its antigenotoxic and neuroprotective effects through antioxidant and antibutyrylcholinesterase activities. Antigenotoxic activity was evaluated against methyl methanesulfonate injected intraperitoneally to mice, using the comet assay. The protective effect of D. gnidium reached 99.12%, at the lowest tested dose (44 mg/kg b.w.) in kidney cells, and 92.16% at the dose of 88 mg/kg b.w. in blood cells. The extract was dissolved in water and administrated to mice by intraperitoneal injection. Antioxidant activity was tested against DPPH radicals. It reached a maximum of 74.52% with an IC50 value of 45 microg/ml. Anticholinesterase activity was determined against butyrylcholinesterase, an enzyme linked to Alzheimer disease. The extract exhibited antibutyrylcholinestrase effect with an inhibition percentage of 35.82% at the lowest tested dose (44 mg/kg b.w.).
