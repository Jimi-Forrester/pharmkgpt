33864416|t|Association of HMOX-1 with sporadic Alzheimer's disease in southern Han Chinese.
33864416|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to discover the associations between HMOX-1 and Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: A total of 500 AD patients and 500 healthy controls were recruited in this study. Polymer chain reaction was used. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant difference between AD patients and controls in both the dominant and recessive models of HMOX-1 rs2071746 after adjustment for age, gender and education (dominant model: p = 0.047, odds ratio [OR] 1.34, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.00-1.78, adjusted; recessive model: p = 0.049, OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.00-1.80, adjusted). There was also a trend for an association between the dominant model and late-onset AD after adjustment for age, gender and education (dominant model: p = 0.084, OR 1.37, 95% CI 0.96-1.95, adjusted). CONCLUSIONS: We found an association between the dominant and recessive models of HMOX1 rs2071746 and AD.
