22284729|t|Spatial distribution and secular trends in the epidemiology of Alzheimer's disease.
22284729|a|There are well-established differences in dementia incidence between communities and within communities over time. In part, these differences may be attributable to local improvements in dementia diagnosis and classification. Nevertheless, there are grounds for cautious optimism that there have been slight, but significant, recent reductions in dementia incidence. Possible causes include public health measures to reduce mortality attributable to stroke and heart disease, improved nutrition, and greater personal wealth. A life-course approach to dementia pathophysiology may help to elucidate the nature and timing of interventions that might delay dementia onset.
