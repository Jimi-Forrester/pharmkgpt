37407280|a|INTRODUCTION: A large body of literature suggests that peripheral nerve blockade (PNB) is associated with improved perioperative outcomes in total hip and knee joint arthroplasty patients. However, it is unclear to what extent this association exists across patient subgroups based on age and health status. METHODS: Patients who underwent total joint arthroplasty were identified from the Premier Healthcare database (2006-2019). Mixed-effects models were applied to assess the relationship between exposure of interest (PNB use on the day of surgery) and various outcomes (postoperative respiratory complications, acute renal failure, delirium, intensive care unit admission, prolonged length of stay, and high opioid consumption) across multiple subgroups stratified by patient age and pre-existing comorbidities. RESULTS: PNB use and outcome association varies based on the patient's health and age characteristics. For adults and older adults with excellent or fair, there was a decrease in the likelihood of respiratory complication with the use of PNB (OR: 0.92, 95% CI 0.86 to 0.98; OR: 0.88, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.95; OR: 0.94, 95% CI 0.89 to 0.99, respectively). Peripheral nerve blocks were also associated with a reduction in the odds of high opioid consumption across all categories except adult patients in poor health. CONCLUSION: PNB use is associated with beneficial effects more commonly observed among patients with a lower comorbidity burden, without a clear pattern of association with patient age.
