35390347|a|Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, as well as the accumulation of intraneuronal proteinaceous inclusions known as Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites. The major protein component of Lewy inclusions is the intrinsically disordered protein alpha-synuclein (alpha-Syn), which can adopt diverse amyloid structures. Different conformational strains of alpha-Syn have been proposed to be related to the onset of distinct synucleinopathies; however, how specific amyloid fibrils cause distinctive pathological traits is not clear. Here, we generated three different alpha-Syn amyloid conformations at different pH and salt concentrations and analyzed the activity of SynuClean-D (SC-D), a small aromatic molecule, on these strains. We show that incubation of alpha-Syn with SC-D reduced the formation of aggregates and the seeded polymerization of alpha-Syn in all cases. Moreover, we found that SC-D exhibited a general fibril disaggregation activity. Finally, we demonstrate that treatment with SC-D also reduced strain-specific intracellular accumulation of phosphorylated alpha-Syn inclusions. Taken together, we conclude that SC-D may be a promising hit compound to inhibit polymorphic alpha-Syn aggregation.
