26103110|a|Cognitive and mental disorders are observed in 15-20% of brain tumors, and can be the first symptoms. The severity of cognitive deficits varies from attention and raisoning disorders to major syndromes such as delirium, amnesic syndrome or dementia. Mental disorders range from apathy, irritability to major depressive or psychotic symptoms. Cognitive and mental disorders are related to many factors including the localization and nature of the tumor, peritumoral and remote changes, and personal suceptibility. The diagnosis of brain tumor is presently made by brain imagery, but the difficulty remains to determine when imagery is to be used in cognitive or mental disorders.
