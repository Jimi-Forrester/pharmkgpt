36285100|t|Liposomal bupivacaine does not decrease postoperative opioid use or length of hospital stay in patients undergoing anterior cervical discectomy and fusion.
36285100|a|Background: Despite its widespread use, definitive data demonstrating the efficacy of liposomal bupivacaine (LB) is limited especially in patients undergoing anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF). Therefore, this investigation examined whether ACDF patients who received intra-operative LB (LB cohort) exhibited decreased post-operative opioid use and lengths of hospital stay (LOS) compared to ACDF patients who did not receive intra-operative LB (controls). Methods: Eighty-two patients who underwent primary ACDF by a single surgeon from 2016 to 2019 were identified from an institutional database. Fifty-nine patients received intra-operative LB while twenty-three did not. Patient characteristics, medical comorbidities, complications, post-operative opioid consumption, and LOS data were collected. Results: The LB cohort did not require fewer opioids on post-operative day (POD) 0, POD1, POD2, or throughout the hospital course after normalizing by LOS (total per LOS). The number of cervical vertebrae involved in surgery, but not LB use, predicted opioid consumption on POD0, POD1, and total per LOS. For every vertebral level involved, 242 additional morphine milligram equivalents (MME) were consumed on POD0, 266 additional MME were utilized on POD1, and 130 additional MME were consumed in total per LOS. Conclusions: ACDF patients who received intra-operative LB did not require fewer post-operative opioids or exhibit a decreased LOS compared to controls. Patients whose procedures involved a greater number of cervical vertebrae were associated with greater opioid consumption on POD0, POD1, and total per LOS. ACDF patients, especially those who had a high number of vertebrae involved, may require alternative analgesia to LB.
