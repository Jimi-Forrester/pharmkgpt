37840538|a|Despite the large number of microfluidic devices that have been described over the past decade for the study of tissues and organs, few have become widely adopted. There are many reasons for this lack of adoption, primarily that devices are constructed for a single purpose or because they are highly complex and require relatively expensive investment in facilities and training. Here, we describe a microphysiological system (MPS) that is simple to use and provides fluid channels above and below cells, or tissue biopsies, maintained on a disposable, poly(methyl methacrylate), carrier held between polycarbonate outer plates. All other fittings are standard Luer sizes for ease of adoption. The carrier can be coated with cells on both sides to generate membrane barriers, and the devices can be established in series to allow medium to flow from one cell layer to another. Furthermore, the carrier containing cells can be easily removed after treatment on the device and the cells can be visualized or recovered for additional off-chip analysis. A 0.4 mum membrane with cell monolayers proved most effective in maintaining separate fluid flows, allowing apical and basal surfaces to be perfused independently. A panel of different cell lines (Caco-2, HT29-MTX-E12, SH-SY5Y, and HUVEC) were successfully maintained in the MPS for up to 7 days, either alone or on devices connected in series. The presence of tight junctions and mucin was expressed as expected by Caco-2 and HT-29-MTX-E12, with Concanavalin A showing uniform staining. Addition of Annexin V and PI showed viability of these cells to be >80% at 7 days. Bacterial extracellular vesicles (BEVs) produced by Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and labeled with 1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindocarbo-cyanine perchlorate (DiD) were used as a model component of the human colonic microbiota and were visualized translocating from an apical surface containing Caco-2 cells to differentiated SH-SY5Y neuronal cells cultured on the basal surface of connected devices. The newly described MPS can be easily adapted, by changing the carrier to maintain spheroids, pieces, or slices of biopsy tissue and joined in series to study a variety of cell and tissue processes. The cell layers can be made more complex through the addition of multiple cell types and/or different patterning of extracellular matrix and the ability to culture cells adjacent to one another to allow study of cell:cell transfer, e.g., passive or active drug transfer, virus or bacterial entry or BEV uptake and transfer.
