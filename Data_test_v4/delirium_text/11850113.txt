11850113|a|A progressive impairment of mitochondrial function has been suggested to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and Huntington's disease. Mitochondrial dysfunction can lead to number of deleterious consequences including impaired calcium buffering, generation of free radicals, activation of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore and secondary excitotoxicity. Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a rare neurological disorder characterized by the appearance of supranuclear gaze palsy and extrapyramidal symptoms [Arch. Neurol. 10 (1964) 333]. Although the etiological basis of PSP is unknown, compelling evidence from spectroscopy studies in PSP patients, biochemical studies in post-mortem PSP brain tissue and PSP cybrids has emerged that supports a contributory role of bio-energetic defects in the pathogenesis of PSP.
