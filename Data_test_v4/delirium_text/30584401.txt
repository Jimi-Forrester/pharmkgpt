30584401|t|Age-dependent Changes in Plasma Amino Acids Contribute to Alterations in Glycoxidation Products.
30584401|a|BACKGROUND: Glycative stress is involved in the pathogenesis of various degenerative disorders. This study sought to determine the effect of age-related changes in amino acids on serum levels of pentosidine and carboxymethyl-lysine (CML) in healthy individuals. METHODS: The subjects were 78 healthy individuals categorized into three age groups. The ages of the groups were as follows: 26 young adults (20-30 y, 25.2+-3.03), 26 middle-aged adults (35-50 y, 39.46+-6.97) and 26 older adults (60 y or older, 69.80+-10.01). Serum levels of pentosidine and CML were measured by ELISA and levels of plasma amino acids were determined using HPLC. RESULTS: Serum levels of pentosidine and CML in the youngest group were higher than in the oldest group (p=0.026, 0.029, respectively). There was a positive correlation between the serum levels of pentosidine and CML and the levels of plasmaTyrosine (p=0.032, r=0.211 and p=0.037, r=0.224), Valine (p=0.037, r=0.224 and p=0.021, r=0.247) and Isoleucine (p=0.041, r=0.203 and p=0.021, r=0.247), respectively. Serum levels of pentosidine and CML may be modulated by the plasma levels of selected amino acids. CONCLUSIONS: Better understanding of the role of these selective amino acids might provide new perception of how glycation pathways may be altered and pave the way for new therapeutic principles.
