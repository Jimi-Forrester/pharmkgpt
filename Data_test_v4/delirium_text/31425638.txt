31425638|t|Prescribing medicines to older people-How to consider the impact of ageing on human organ and body functions.
31425638|a|Ageing is associated with several changes in human organs, which result in altered medication pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Ageing is also associated with changes in human body functions, such as impaired vision, hearing, swallowing, motor and cognitive functions, which can affect the adequate intake and administration of drugs. As a consequence, older people, and especially patients older than 75 years, are the main users of many drugs and they frequently use 5 drugs or more long-term (i.e. polypharmacy). All this increases the complexity of adequate drug intake, administration and adherence. However, there is a lack of evidence on the considerations that should be taken into account to ensure appropriate drug prescribing to older people. This review article summarizes the most clinically relevant changes in human organ and body functions and the consequential changes in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in older people, along with possible dosing consequences or alternatives for drugs frequently prescribed to this patient population. Recommendations are given on how ageing could be considered in clinical drug development, drug authorization and appropriate prescribing.
