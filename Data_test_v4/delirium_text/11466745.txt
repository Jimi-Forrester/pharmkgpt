11466745|a|OBJECTIVES: To analyse the neuropathological changes behind clinically defined dementia with Lewy bodies (clinDLB) compared with clinically diagnosed Alzheimer's disease (clinAD). METHODS: The prevalence of neuropathological findings in 48 clinDLB and 45 clinAD cases was compared. Sixteen clinDLB and 10 clinAD cases were reassessed with alpha-synuclein staining for Lewy bodies (LB). RESULTS: Alzheimer pathology was found in 81% of the clinDLB and 93% of the clinAD cases. The clinDLB group had a higher prevalence of frontal white matter pathology, mostly of ischemic type, and a more severe degeneration of the substantia nigra compared with the clinAD group. In hematoxylin-eosin staining, LBs were identified in seven (15%) of the clinDLB and in four (9%) of the clinAD group. In alpha-synuclein staining, 38% of the clinDLB and 40% of the clinAD cases exhibited LBs. The cases without LBs, in the clinDLB group, had AD pathology in combination with frontal white matter disease. Vascular pathology of significant degree was prevalent in more than 40% of all the cases with verified LBs regardless of clinical diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Consecutive dementia cases, fulfilling the clinical consensus criteria for DLB, may exhibit combinations of neuropathological changes which in themselves can explain the clinical picture of DLB even when LBs are absent.
