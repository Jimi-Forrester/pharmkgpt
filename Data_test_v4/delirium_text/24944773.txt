24944773|a|BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of exercise (EX) and Korean red ginseng (KRG) on inflammation mechanism in aging model rats with diet-induced atherosclerosis. MATERIALS/METHODS: Forty-eight male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 6 groups: Young control (Y-C), Aging control (A-C), A-C with HFD (AHF), AHF with EX (AHF-EX), AHF-EX with KRG (AHF-EX+RG), and AHF with KRG (AHF-RG). Aging was induced by D-gal (100mg/kg) and atherosclerosis was induced by HFD (60% fat) for 9 weeks. The experimental rats were performed swimming (60 min/day, 5 days/week) and supplied KRG orally (dose of 200 mg/kg) for 8 weeks. All rat aorta samples were harvested for biochemical and immunohistochemical analyses. REULTS: The EX and KRG supplementation significantly inhibited body weight and levels of TC, TG, LDL-C, and enhance of HDL-C compared with untreated AHF groups. AHF-EX, AHF-EX+RG, and AHF-RG group showed a decreased plasma CRP and increase plasma NO activities compared to AHF group. In addition, these groups revealed reduced 4-HNE, NF-kB, TNF-alpha, IL-6, COX-2, ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and enhanced eNOS expression in the aorta. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that EX alone, KRG alone, and combined treatment of EX and KRG may be an effective anti-inflammatory therapeutic for the atherosclerosis, possibly acting via the decreased of CRP and pro-inflammation proteins and the increased NO and eNOS.
