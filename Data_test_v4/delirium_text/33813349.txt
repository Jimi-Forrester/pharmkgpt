33813349|t|Age, sex, and cerebral microbleeds in EFAD Alzheimer disease mice.
33813349|a|Cerebral microbleeds (MBs) increase at later ages in association with increased cognitive decline and Alzheimer Disease (AD). MB prevalence is also increased by APOE4 and hypertension. In EFAD mice (5XFAD+/-/human APOE+/+), cerebral cortex MBs are most prevalent in E4 females at 6 months, paralleling plaque amyloid. We evaluated MBs at 2, 4, and 6 months in relation to amyloid in plaques and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) by age, sex, APOE allele, and blood pressure. At 2 mo, MBs were 50% more numerous than plaques, followed by decreased ratio of MBs:Abeta plaques with female excess to 6 mo. The stable size of MBs suggests MBs arise as single events of extravasation, which may "seed" plaque formation. Blood pressure was normal from 2 to 6 months, minimizing a role of hypertension. Memory, assessed by fear conditioning, decreased with age in correlation with MBs and amyloid. Cortical layer analysis showed prevalent MBs and plaque in layers 4 and 5. Contrarily, CAA was prevalent in layers 1 and 2, discounting its contribution to MBs.
