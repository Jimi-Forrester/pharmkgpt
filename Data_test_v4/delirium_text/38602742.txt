38602742|a|Prior investigations have established that the manipulation of neural activity has the potential to influence both rapid eye movement and non-rapid eye movement sleep. Low-intensity retinal ultrasound stimulation has shown effectiveness in the modulation of neural activity. Nevertheless, the specific effects of retinal ultrasound stimulation on rapid eye movement and non-rapid eye movement sleep, as well as its potential to enhance overall sleep quality, remain to be elucidated. Here, we found that: In healthy mice, retinal ultrasound stimulation: (i) reduced total sleep time and non-rapid eye movement sleep ratio; (ii) changed relative power and sample entropy of the delta (0.5-4 Hz) in non-rapid eye movement sleep; and (iii) enhanced relative power of the theta (4-8 Hz) and reduced theta-gamma coupling strength in rapid eye movement sleep. In Alzheimer's disease mice with sleep disturbances, retinal ultrasound stimulation: (i) reduced the total sleep time; (ii) altered the relative power of the gamma band during rapid eye movement sleep; and (iii) enhanced the coupling strength of delta-gamma in non-rapid eye movement sleep and weakened the coupling strength of theta-fast gamma. The results indicate that retinal ultrasound stimulation can modulate rapid eye movement and non-rapid eye movement-related neural activity; however, it is not beneficial to the sleep quality of healthy and Alzheimer's disease mice.
