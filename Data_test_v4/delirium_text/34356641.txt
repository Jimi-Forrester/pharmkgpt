34356641|a|BACKGROUND: Vitamin D has a steroid- and an anabolic-resembling chemical structure. Vitamin D is essential for many processes in the human body after hydroxylation. AIMS OF THE STUDY: To investigate the impact of 25-hydroxy-vitamin D plasma concentrations on the blood parameters number of erythrocytes, hematocrit, mean corpuscular hemoglobin and mean corpuscular volume. METHODS: Serial assessments were done in 290 patients with multiple sclerosis and repeated after a mean interval of 245 days. A recommendation for vitamin D supplementation was given in case of a concentration lower than 20 ng/mL combined with a prescription of a formulation containing vitamin D but not vitamin K. RESULTS: There was a fall of vitamin D in 119 subjects and a rise in 164, while no change appeared in 7 participants. When vitamin D values went down between both assessments moments, the computed increase of mean corpuscular haemoglobin was significantly lower compared with the rise of mean corpuscular haemoglobin associated with a vitamin D elevation. When vitamin D declined, the computed fall of mean corpuscular volume fall was significantly lower compared with the decrease of mean corpuscular volume, when vitamin D rose. Positive correlations were found between differences of vitamin D and mean corpuscular haemoglobin, respectively mean corpuscular volume. Inverse relations appeared between disparities of vitamin D and erythrocytes, respectively haematocrit. CONCLUSIONS: The elevation of vitamin D plasma levels provides enhanced preconditions for a better tissue oxygenation on a cellular level.
