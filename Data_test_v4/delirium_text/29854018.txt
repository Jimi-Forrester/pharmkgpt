29854018|t|Delusions in Patients with Dementia with Lewy Bodies and the Associated Factors.
29854018|a|OBJECTIVE: Delusions are common neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). The aim of this study was to investigate the associated factors of delusions in patients with DLB. METHOD: A retrospective study of outpatients with DLB registered in a regional hospital's database was performed. The associated factors including cognitive performance, clinical features, vascular risk factors, and neuropsychiatric symptoms between delusional and nondelusional patients with DLB were compared. RESULTS: Among 207 patients with DLB, 106 (51.2%) were delusional and 101 (48.8%) were not. Delusion of other persons are stealing was the most common symptom (35.3%). The delusional group had a significantly higher diagnostic rate of probable than possible DLB, higher disease severity, poorer cognitive performance, more severe neuropsychiatric symptoms, and higher caregiver burden (all p < 0.05). In addition, the delusional group had a significantly lower frequency of diabetes compared to the nondelusional group (odds ratio = 0.28, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Delusion of other persons are stealing was the most common delusional symptom. The patients with DLB who presented with delusions had poorer cognitive function and more severe neuropsychiatric symptoms. A novel finding is that the DLB patients with diabetes had a lower frequency of delusions.
