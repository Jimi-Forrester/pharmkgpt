7462547|a|An eight-week support group program was conducted for 15 members of the families of Alzheimer patients still living at home. It became clear that caring for an Alzheimer patient at home created tremendous practical, psychologic and social problems for family members. Frequently discussed problems included lack of support and information from physicians, poor understanding of the disease, depression, a trapped feeling, anger and fear about the patient's behavioral problems, isolation, and the caretaker's loss of self-identity. Group participation was especially beneficial for spouses who functioned as primary care providers. It increased their understanding of the disease, made them feel more supported and less isolated, and helped them resolve some of the feelings created by the illness. It also helped spouses to become more aware of their own needs and to regain some self-identity in relation to the patient. Such family support programs offer a way to strengthen the emotional well-being and treatment skills of the care-providing family and are an important aid to treatment in Alzheimer's disease.
