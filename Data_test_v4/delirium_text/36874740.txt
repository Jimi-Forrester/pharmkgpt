36874740|t|Nasogastric Tube-Induced Catastrophic Airway Compromise Due to a Large Blood Clot.
36874740|a|Nasogastric and orogastric tube (NGT/OGT) insertion is a routine in-hospital procedure used in patients who need enteral feeding, medication administration, and gastric decompression in a patient unable to tolerate per oral administration. NGT insertion has a relatively low complication rate when performed adequately; however, previous studies demonstrate that associated complications range from delicate, simple nose bleeds to more severe conditions such as nasal mucosal bleeding, which can be easily aspirated in a patient with encephalopathy or other conditions associated with the inability to protect the airway. Here we present a case of traumatic NGT insertion causing nasal bleeding, leading to respiratory distress secondary to aspiration of blood clot obscuring the airway.
