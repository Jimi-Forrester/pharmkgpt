10674495|t|Presenilin I expression in yeast lowers secretion of the amyloid precursor protein.
10674495|a|Presenilin (PS) mutations are associated with early-onset Alzheimer's disease and PS proteins are involved with gamma-secretase cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein, APP. We have shown previously that alpha-, beta- and gamma-secretase cleavages of APP are conserved in Pichia pastoris. Here, we report co-expression of APP and PSI in P. pastoris and show by immunoelectron microscopy colocalization of these two proteins in expanded endoplasmic reticulum. Western blot analysis indicates a drastic reduction of both alpha- and beta-secretase products. A relative increase in beta-secretase product derived from immature APP is also observed, pointing to a beta-secretase activity of P. pastoris associated with the early secretory pathway.
