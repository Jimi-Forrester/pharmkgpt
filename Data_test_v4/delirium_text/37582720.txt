37582720|a|BACKGROUND: Lifespan extension has independently evolved several times during mammalian evolution, leading to the emergence of a group of long-lived animals. Though mammalian/mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway is shown as a central regulator of lifespan and aging, the underlying influence of mTOR pathway on the evolution of lifespan in mammals is not well understood. RESULTS: Here, we performed evolution analyses of 72 genes involved in the mTOR network across 48 mammals to explore the underlying mechanism of lifespan extension. We identified a total of 20 genes with significant evolution signals unique to long-lived species, including 12 positively selected genes, four convergent evolution genes, and five longevity associated genes whose evolution rate related to the maximum lifespan (MLS). Of these genes, four positively selected genes, two convergent evolution genes and one longevity-associated gene were involved in the autophagy response and aging-related diseases, while eight genes were known as cancer genes, indicating the long-lived species might have evolved effective regulation mechanisms of autophagy and cancer to extend lifespan. CONCLUSION: Our study revealed genes with significant evolutionary signals unique to long-lived species, which provided new insight into the lifespan extension of mammals and might bring new strategies to extend human lifespan.
