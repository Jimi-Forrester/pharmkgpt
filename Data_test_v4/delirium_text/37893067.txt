37893067|t|CAR T-Cells in Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia: Current Status and Future Prospects.
37893067|a|The currently available treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is mainly dependent on the combination of chemotherapy, steroids, and allogeneic stem cell transplantation. However, refractoriness and relapse (R/R) after initial complete remission may reach up to 20% in pediatrics. This percentage may even reach 60% in adults. To overcome R/R, a new therapeutic approach was developed using what is called chimeric antigen receptor-modified (CAR) T-cell therapy. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States has so far approved four CAR T-cells for the treatment of ALL. Using this new therapeutic strategy has shown a remarkable success in treating R/R ALL. However, the use of CAR T-cells is expensive, has many imitations, and is associated with some adverse effects. Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) are two common examples of these adverse effects. Moreover, R/R to CAR T-cell therapy can take place during treatment. Continuous development of this therapeutic strategy is ongoing to overcome these limitations and adverse effects. The present article overviews the use of CAR T-cell in the treatment of ALL, summarizing the results of relevant clinical trials and discussing future prospects intended to improve the efficacy of this therapeutic strategy and overcome its limitations.
