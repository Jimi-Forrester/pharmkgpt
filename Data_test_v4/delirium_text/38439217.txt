38439217|a|BACKGROUND: Current evidence for the management of symptoms associated with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) using donepezil is limited. We conducted a meta-analysis of three randomised controlled trials of donepezil in patients with DLB to investigate the overall efficacy of donepezil on Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), and Clinician's Interview-Based Impression of Change-plus Caregiver Input (CIBIC-plus). METHODS: A meta-analysis was performed using the data of 312 patients administered placebo or 10 mg donepezil. Overall mean score differences for MMSE, NPI-2, and NPI-10 from baseline to week 12 and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated. For CIBIC-plus, which was transformed from a seven-point grade to a dichotomous outcome (improvements/no improvements), odds ratio (OR) and its 95% CI were estimated. Random-effects models were used, and heterogeneity was evaluated using the Cochrane's Q test and I2 statistic. RESULTS: Heterogeneity was suspected for NPI-2 (P < 0.05; I2  = 87.2%) and NPI-10 (P < 0.05; I2  = 67.7%) while it was not suspected for MMSE (P = 0.23; I2  = 32.4%) and CIBIC-plus (P = 0.26; I2  = 19.8%). The overall mean MMSE score difference (mean difference: 1.50; 95% CI, 0.67-2.34) and the overall odds of improving CIBIC-plus (OR: 2.20; 95% CI, 1.13-4.26) from baseline to week 12 were higher in the donepezil group than in the placebo group. CONCLUSION: Results of our meta-analysis indicated overall efficacy of donepezil on cognitive impairment and global clinical status in patients with DLB.
