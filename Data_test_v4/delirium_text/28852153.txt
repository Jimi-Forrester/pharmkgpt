28852153|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifactorial neurodegenerative disorder and there is no effective cure for this devastating disease to date. Bushen Yizhi Formula (BSYZ-F), a Chinese herbal compound, has proved to be effective for AD. In this study, we further investigate the effective part of BSYZ-F, ethyl acetate extract components of BSYZ-F (BSYZ-E), protects scopolamine (SCOP)-induced cognitive impairment, which shows a similar effect to BSYZ-F. We also find that BSYZ-E could protect against SCOP-induced cholinergic system dysfunction. In neuron function level, BSYZ-E remarkably elevates protein levels of nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). BSYZ-E also significantly mitigates SCOP-induced apoptosis, oxidative stress and nitrosative stress. Conclusively, BSYZ-E, the effective part of BSYZ-F, can provide neuroprotection against SCOP-induced cognitive impairment through a multifunctional strategy. These findings suggest that BSYZ-E might be developed as a therapeutic drug for AD by targeting multiple pathways of the pathogenesis.
