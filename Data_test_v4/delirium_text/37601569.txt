37601569|t|Synthesis, crystal structure and Hirshfeld surface analysis of tert-butyl 4-[4-(di-fluoro-meth-oxy)phen-yl]-2,7,7-trimethyl-5-oxo-1,4,5,6,7,8-hexa-hydro-quinoline-3-carboxyl-ate.
37601569|a|The 1,4-di-hydro-pyridine ring of the title compound, C24H29F2NO4, adopts a distorted boat conformation, while the cyclo-hexene ring is in an almost twist-boat conformation. In the crystal, N-H O and C-H O hydrogen bonds as well as C-H pi inter-actions connect mol-ecules, forming layers parallel to the (100) plane. These layers are linked by van der Waals forces and C-H F inter-actions, which consolidate the crystal structure. Hirshfeld surface analysis shows the major contributions to the crystal packing are from H H (54.1%), F H/H F (16.9%), O H/H O (15.4%) and C H/H C (12.6%) contacts.
