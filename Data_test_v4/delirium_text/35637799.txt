35637799|t|Sedation With Dexmedetomidine During Lymphangiography and Thoracic Duct Embolization in an Elderly Man.
35637799|a|An 83-year-old man underwent cervical esophagectomy and developed a chylothorax as a postoperative complication. We decided to perform lymphangiography and thoracic duct embolization for chylous leakage, but it was expected to be challenging to maintain bed rest. Therefore, dexmedetomidine was administered for procedural sedation. The patient's blood pressure and heart rate were mostly stable during the procedure, and the sedation level was maintained within the desired limits. Due to its specific sedative pattern and mild analgesic effect, Dexmedetomidine is suitable for procedural sedation in various painless interventional radiology procedures, such as lymphangiography and thoracic duct embolization. Therefore, it may be the best sedative for the elderly and should be widely and effectively used in interventional radiology.
