37259372|a|BACKGROUND: Whether metformin may reduce the risk of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) requires confirmation. This study compared the risk of AMD between ever users and never users of metformin matched on propensity score (PS) in Taiwanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. METHODS: We enrolled study subjects from Taiwan's National Health Insurance. A total of 423,949 patients with new onset diabetes from 1999 to 2005 were identified. After excluding ineligible patients and enrolling only patients aged between 50 and 79 years, we created 13,303 pairs of ever users and never users of metformin matched on PS. The patients were followed from 1 January 2006 to 31 December 2011. We estimated hazard ratios by Cox regression. RESULTS: AMD was newly diagnosed in 506 ever users and 639 never users. The respective incidence rates (per 100,000 person-years) were 778.72 and 1016.62. The hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for ever versus never users was 0.756 (0.673-0.850). While ever users were categorized by tertiles of cumulative duration (<31.8, 31.8-63.9 and >63.9 months) and cumulative dose (<947.1, 947.1-2193.5 and >2193.5 g) of metformin, a dose-response pattern was observed. For the respective tertiles of cumulative duration, the HRs (95% CIs) were 1.131 (0.961-1.330), 0.821 (0.697-0.967) and 0.464 (0.384-0.561), while compared to never users. For the respective tertiles of cumulative dose, the HRs (95% CIs) were 1.131 (0.962-1.329), 0.739 (0.624-0.876) and 0.525 (0.438-0.629). A risk reduction among ever users was observed for all tertiles of defined daily dose but was most remarkable for the third tertile with a defined daily dose of >0.64. Subgroup analyses suggested that the benefit of metformin could be similarly observed among men and women and for age subgroups of 50-64 and 65-79 years. However, patients with diabetic retinopathy would not be significantly benefited and metformin did not seem to be preventive for exudative AMD. CONCLUSION: In general, metformin significantly reduces the risk of AMD.
