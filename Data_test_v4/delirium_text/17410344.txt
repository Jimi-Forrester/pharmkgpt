This review provides an update of the diagnostic criteria and treatment strategies and the current knowledge about the mechanisms involved in sepsis associated brain dysfunction. DATA SOURCES: Articles published between 1981 and 2006 were identified through a Medline search for "encephalopathy" and "sepsis" and by hand searching of articles cited in the identified publications. The immune response to sepsis results in multiorgan failure including brain dysfunction. DISCUSSION: The potential mechanisms for sepsis-associated delirium include vascular damage, endothelial activation, breakdown of the blood-brain barrier, metabolic disorders, brain inflammation and apoptosis. On the other hand, there is evidence for distinct neuroprotective factors, such as anti-inflammatory mediators and glial cell activity. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of sepsis-associated delirium relies mainly on clinical and electrophysiological criteria, and its treatment is entirely based on general management of sepsis.
