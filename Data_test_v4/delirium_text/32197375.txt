32197375|t|Prediction of Frailty and Dementia Using Oral Health Impact Profile from a Population-Based Survey.
32197375|a|Oral health and dentition have been associated with cognitive ability and frailty, but an applicable screening tool has not yet been developed. This study aimed to establish risk prediction models for dementia and frailty. A sample of 2905 community-dwelling older adults aged >=58 years using the Taiwan Longitudinal Study on Aging (TLSA) survey was adapted and analyzed for this study. Risk scores were estimated by stepwise logistic regression. In models adjusted for covariates, increased age, female sex, no dental prosthesis (adjusted Odds ratio [adjOR], 1.61; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.11-2.35), diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and an increased Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP)-7T Q3 score (adjOR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.19-1.49) were all significantly associated with frailty. In addition to these factors, an inability to self-report height or weight (adjOR, 4.52; 95% CI, 3.52-5.81) and an increased OHIP-7T Q7 score (adjOR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.06-1.37) were significantly associated with dementia. The cut-off points of the risk scores for frailty and dementia were 80 (sensitivity, 80.0%; specificity, 81.2%) and 77 (sensitivity, 83.4%; specificity, 71.5%), respectively. The findings highlighted a number of composite risk factors of frailty and dementia. Importantly, the developed prediction models were easily applicable to screen for frailty and dementia in communities or dental clinics.
