33561686|a|The plant popularly known as "negramina" (Siparuna guianensis Aubl.), member of the family Siparunaceae produces an essential oil that presents several biological activities reported in literature. Here, the essential oil was obtained by hydrodistillation from fresh leaves collected in the state of Roraima, far north of the Amazon. Chemical composition of the essential oil was characterized by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and flame ionization detector (GC-FID). The sesquiterpenoid shyobunone and its derivatives were identified as major compounds in the oil (>40%). The effect of S. guianensis essential oil on the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity from Crassostrea rhizophorae, Litopenaeus vannamei and Electrophorus electricus was tested by spectrophotometric assays. The essential oil has been identified as an AChE inhibitor. The mechanism of inhibition was investigated as well as spectrofluorimetric interactions between the essential oil and the enzyme. 1H NMR titration and molecular docking were also investigated. The spectrophotometric results revealed that shyobunone and its derivatives strongly interact with AChE with a kind of non-competitive inhibition. Interaction studies support the results of enzyme inhibition. Molecular coupling predicted that iso-shyobunone is the strongest ligand, corroborated by fluorescence suppression and 1H NMR titration results. In conclusion, Siparuna guianensis essential oil can be a new source of shyobunone and derivatives capable to reversibly inhibit AChE showing potential neuroprotective properties to be applied in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
