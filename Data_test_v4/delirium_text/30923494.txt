30923494|t|Regional Differences in Years of Life Lost in Korea from 1997 to 2015.
30923494|a|BACKGROUND: Reducing the gaps in health inequality at a regional level and improving health equity have been emphasized in Korea, it is essential to accurately measure the burden of disease by region. This study aimed to estimate years of life lost (YLLs) in 17 Si and Do of Korea from 1997 to 2015 and determine the trends of regional differences in health status and disease structure. METHODS: YLL was calculated by subtracting the age at death from the life expectancy. Data on the region, gender, and age-stratified cause-specific death were obtained from the Korean Statistical Information Service of Statistics Korea. RESULTS: Age-standardized YLLs per 100,000 population decreased by year in all regions from 1997 to 2015 by 27.4% (27.5% for men; 27.2% for women). Despite the decline in YLLs, the regions with the highest and lowest YLLs did not change between 1997 and 2015. The diseases showing regional differences were caused by injury, often classified as avoidable mortality. We also confirmed that YLLs were higher in the regions with a higher deprivation index. CONCLUSION: The present study identified that YLLs differed by regions in Korea with specific causes. The findings of this study can be used by decision-makers to prioritize the reduction of regional gaps in premature deaths.
