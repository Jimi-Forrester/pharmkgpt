27716674|t|Insula and Inferior Frontal Gyrus' Activities Protect Memory Performance Against Alzheimer's Disease Pathology in Old Age.
27716674|a|Apolipoprotein E (APOE) e4 carriers and patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) have high risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). The Scaffolding Theory of Aging and Cognition proposes that recruitment of additional frontal brain regions can protect cognition against aging. This thesis has yet to be fully tested in older adults at high risk for AD. In the present study, 75 older participants (mean age: 74 years) were included. Applying a voxel-wise approach, fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF) in resting-state functional neuroimaging data were analyzed as a function of APOEe4 status (carrier versus noncarrier) and clinical status (healthy control [HC] versus MCI) using a 2x2 analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Measures of cognition and cerebrospinal fluid levels of amyloid- beta were also obtained. Three frontal regions were identified with significant interaction effects using ANCOVA (corrected p < 0.01): left-insula, left-inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), and right-precentral gyrus. The HC/APOEe4 carrier group had significantly higher fALFF in all three regions than other groups. In the entire sample, for two regions (left insula and left IFG), a significant positive relationship between amyloid-beta and memory was only observed among individuals with low fALFF. Our results suggest higher activity in frontal regions may explain being cognitively normal among a subgroup of APOEe4 carriers and protect against the negative impact of AD-associated pathology on memory. This is an observation with potential implications for AD therapeutics.
