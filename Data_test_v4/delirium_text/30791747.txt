30791747|a|INTRODUCTION: Patients with gastrointestinal (GI) cancer-associated cachexia are at risk of high morbidity and mortality. This randomized single-blind pilot study compared the complementary use of targeted acupuncture (TA) with nontargeted acupuncture (NTA) for halting cachexia symptoms. METHODS: GI cancer patients with cachexia undergoing chemotherapy were assigned to receive 8 weekly sessions of either TA (n = 15) or NTA (n = 15) following a specific acupuncture protocol. Bioelectrical impedance analysis and weight were measured weekly. Biological markers, including C-reactive protein, prealbumin, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), leptin, and ghrelin blood levels were determined at specific intervals. RESULTS: Prealbumin levels and fat-free mass were significantly higher in the NTA group at the end of the study, but remained stable in TA group. TA group had significantly lower (230 IU/L vs 288 IU/L, P = .04) LDH at the end of the study, but elevated tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels (13.15 pg/mL vs 9.24 pg/mL, P = .04). The absolute blood leptin and ghrelin levels decreased in the TA but remained stable in the NTA group. Both groups maintained weight, but the TA group trended toward weight gain during the last 2 weeks of the study. No adverse events related to acupuncture were reported. CONCLUSIONS: TA using predetermined, reproducible points may provide benefits to some patients with GI cancer cachexia by normalizing metabolic dysregulation. Elevated ghrelin levels are indicative of insulin resistance, which can lead to increased muscle loss represented by increased LDH activity in the NTA group. The pilot study provided completion rate and effect size for the primary outcome measures for a larger study. A longer treatment duration may be required to further refine these findings.
