38015595|a|BACKGROUND: In the COVID-19 pandemic, a visit restriction policy for patients has been implemented in medical institutions worldwide and visits are being made using alternative communication technologies. This shift has also required the use of platforms to prevent negative consequences of these restrictions. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this review was to comprehensively explore nonface-to-face visits as an alternative during infection prevention and to synthesize the scientific evidence of their benefits and disadvantages. METHODS: A comprehensive search was conducted via the PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane, and Web of Science electronic databases; unpublished trials in the clinical trials register ClinicalTrials.gov; and Virginia Henderson International Nursing Library up to September 10, 2021. The search query was developed according to the guidelines of the Peer Review of Electronic Search Strategies and included keywords on the topics of telemedicine and visitation restrictions. The inclusion criteria were a nonface-to-face modality using telemedicine with family in a hospital setting, experimental and observational studies, and articles written in English. The exclusion criteria were inaccessible in full text, not related to patient or family involvement, mainly focused on the study protocol, or only discussing the pros and cons of telemedicine. RESULTS: Overall, patients' families experienced emotional distress due to restrictions on face-to-face visits. Nonface-to-face virtual visits compensating for these restrictions had a positive effect on reducing the risk of infection to the patient and the family. This further encouraged psychological and physical recovery and decreased psychological distress. However, nonface-to-face virtual technology could not replace the existence of actual families, and technical problems with networks and devices are reported as limitations. CONCLUSIONS: Ensuring the availability of technology and educating on the same in alignment with the characteristics of patients and their families, nonface-to-face virtual visits need to show more potential as an effective patient-centered treatment strategy based on more research and advanced practice.
