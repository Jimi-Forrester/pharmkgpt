39334797|t|Exploring the Role of Reactive Oxygen Species in the Pathogenesis and Pathophysiology of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Disease and the Efficacy of Antioxidant Treatment.
39334797|a|Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's Disease (PD) are life-altering diseases that are characterised by progressive memory loss and motor dysfunction. The prevalence of AD and PD is predicted to continuously increase. Symptoms of AD and PD are primarily mediated by progressive neuron death and dysfunction in the hippocampus and substantia nigra. Central features that drive neurodegeneration are caspase activation, DNA fragmentation, lipid peroxidation, protein carbonylation, amyloid-beta, and/or alpha-synuclein formation. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) increase these central features. Currently, there are limited therapeutic options targeting these mechanisms. Antioxidants reduce ROS levels by the induction of antioxidant proteins and direct neutralisation of ROS. This review aims to assess the effectiveness of antioxidants in reducing ROS and neurodegeneration. Antioxidants enhance major endogenous defences against ROS including superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione. Direct neutralisation of ROS by antioxidants protects against ROS-induced cytotoxicity. The combination of Indirect and direct protective mechanisms prevents ROS-induced alpha-synuclein and/or amyloid-beta formation. Antioxidants ameliorate ROS-mediated oxidative stress and subsequent deleterious downstream effects that promote apoptosis. As a result, downstream harmful events including neuron death, dysfunction, and protein aggregation are decreased. The protective effects of antioxidants in human models have yet to directly replicate the success seen in cell and animal models. However, the lack of diversity in antioxidants for clinical trials prevents a definitive answer if antioxidants are protective. Taken together, antioxidant treatment is a promising avenue in neurodegenerative disease therapy and subsequent clinical trials are needed to provide a definitive answer on the protective effects of antioxidants. No current treatment strategies have significant impact in treating advanced AD and PD, but new mimetics of endogenous mitochondrial antioxidant enzymes (Avasopasem Manganese, GC4419 AVA) may be a promising innovative option for decelerating neurodegenerative progress in the future at the mitochondrial level of OS.
