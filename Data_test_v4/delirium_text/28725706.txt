28725706|a|The benefit of deep brain stimulation (DBS) in controlling the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease is well established, however, the impact on the non-motor symptoms (NMS) remains to be elucidated, although the growing investigative efforts are promising. This article reviews the reported data and considers the level of evidence available with regard to the effect of DBS on NMS total burden and on the cognitive, neuropsychiatric, sleep, pain, dysautonomic, and weight domains. Multiple case series suggest that DBS improves the burden of NMS by reducing prevalence, intensity, and non-motor fluctuations. There is level I evidence on the effect of DBS on cognition and mood. Slight cognitive decline has been reported in most class I studies, although the functional effect is probably minimal. Two randomized prospective studies reported no change in depression while improvement of anxiety has been reported by a class I trial. Prospective cohort studies point to improvement of hyperdopaminergic behaviors, such as impulse control disorders, while others report that hypodopaminergic states, like apathy, can appear after DBS. There is only class III evidence supporting the benefit of DBS on other NMS such as nocturnal sleep, pain, dysautonomia (urinary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and sweating), and weight loss. Although preliminary results are promising, randomized prospectively controlled trials with NMS as primary end points are necessary to further explore the effect of DBS on these often invalidating symptoms and offer conclusions about efficacy.
