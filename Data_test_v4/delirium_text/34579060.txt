34579060|a|It is imperative that the surgical treatment of hip fractures is followed up with rehabilitation to enhance recovery and quality of life. This randomized controlled trial aimed to determine if an individualised, combined exercise-nutrition intervention significantly improved health outcomes in older adults, after proximal femoral fracture. We commenced the community extended therapy while in hospital, within two weeks post-surgery. The primary outcome was gait speed and secondary outcomes included physical function, strength and balance, body composition, energy and protein intake. Eighty-six and 89 participants were randomized into six months individualised exercise and nutrition intervention and attention-control groups, respectively. There were no statistically significant differences in gait speed between the groups at six and 12 months. There were no major differences between groups with respect to the secondary outcomes, except estimated energy and protein intake. This may be explained by the sample size achieved. Participants in the intervention group had greater increment in energy (235 kcal; 95% CI, 95 to 375; p = 0.01) and protein intake (9.1 g; 95% CI, 1.5 to 16.8; p = 0.02), compared with those in the control group at six months but not significant at 12 months. This study has demonstrated that providing early, combined exercise and nutrition therapy can improve dietary energy and protein intake in older adults with hip fractures.
