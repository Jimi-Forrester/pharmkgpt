34445520|t|Endocytic Protein Defects in the Neural Crest Cell Lineage and Its Pathway Are Associated with Congenital Heart Defects.
34445520|a|Endocytic trafficking is an under-appreciated pathway in cardiac development. Several genes related to endocytic trafficking have been uncovered in a mutagenic ENU screen, in which mutations led to congenital heart defects (CHDs). In this article, we review the relationship between these genes (including LRP1 and LRP2) and cardiac neural crest cells (CNCCs) during cardiac development. Mice with an ENU-induced Lrp1 mutation exhibit a spectrum of CHDs. Conditional deletion using a floxed Lrp1 allele with different Cre drivers showed that targeting neural crest cells with Wnt1-Cre expression replicated the full cardiac phenotypes of the ENU-induced Lrp1 mutation. In addition, LRP1 function in CNCCs is required for normal OFT lengthening and survival/expansion of the cushion mesenchyme, with other cell lineages along the NCC migratory path playing an additional role. Mice with an ENU-induced and targeted Lrp2 mutation demonstrated the cardiac phenotype of common arterial trunk (CAT). Although there is no impact on CNCCs in Lrp2 mutants, the loss of LRP2 results in the depletion of sonic hedgehog (SHH)-dependent cells in the second heart field. SHH is known to be crucial for CNCC survival and proliferation, which suggests LRP2 has a non-autonomous role in CNCCs. In this article, other endocytic trafficking proteins that are associated with CHDs that may play roles in the NCC pathway during development, such as AP1B1, AP2B1, FUZ, MYH10, and HECTD1, are reviewed.
