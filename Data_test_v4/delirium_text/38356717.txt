38356717|a|Background: P7C3 is a novel compound that has been widely applied in neurodegenerative diseases and nerve injury repair. Here, we show that higher concentrations of P7C3 than are required for in vivo neuroprotection have the novel function of suppressing renal cell carcinoma (RCC) proliferation and metastasis. Methods: Colony formation, CCK-8 and EdU assay were applied to evaluate RCC cell proliferation. Wound healing and transwell assay were used to measure RCC cell migration and invasion. Flow cytometry assay was employed to detect RCC cell apoptosis and cell cycle. qRT-PCR assay was carried out to measure ribonucleotide reductase subunit M2 (RRM2) mRNA expression level, while western blot assay was utilized to detect the expression level of target proteins. RCC cell growth in vivo was determined by xenografts in mice. Results: We observed that high concentrations of P7C3 could restrain the proliferation and metastasis of RCC cells and promote cell apoptosis. Mechanistically, this new effect of higher dose of P7C3 was associated with reduced expression of RRM2, and the beneficial efficacy of P7C3 in RCC was blocked when suppression of RRM2 was prevented. When RRM2 suppression was permitted, the cGAS-STING pathway was activated by virtue of RRM2/Bcl-2/Bax signaling. Lastly, intraperitoneal injection of this high level of P7C3 in mice potently inhibited tumor growth. Conclusion: In conclusion, we show here that P7C3 that exerts an anti-cancer effect in RCC. Our study indicated that P7C3 might act as a novel drug for RCC in the future. The regulatory signal pathway RRM2/Bcl-2/BAX/cGAS-STING might present novel insight to the potential mechanism of RCC development.
