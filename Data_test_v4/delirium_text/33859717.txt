33859717|t|A Protocol for the Diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder Structured in Machine Learning and Verbal Decision Analysis.
33859717|a|Autism Spectrum Disorder is a mental disorder that afflicts millions of people worldwide. It is estimated that one in 160 children has traces of autism, with five times the higher prevalence in boys. The protocols for detecting symptoms are diverse. However, the following are among the most used: the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5), of the American Psychiatric Association; the Revised Autistic Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS-R); the Autistic Diagnostic Interview (ADI); and the International Classification of Diseases, 10th edition (ICD-10), published by the World Health Organization (WHO) and adopted in Brazil by the Unified Health System (SUS). The application of machine learning models helps make the diagnostic process of Autism Spectrum Disorder more precise, reducing, in many cases, the number of criteria necessary for evaluation, denoting a form of attribute engineering (feature engineering) efficiency. This work proposes a hybrid approach based on machine learning algorithms' composition to discover knowledge and concepts associated with the multicriteria method of decision support based on Verbal Decision Analysis to refine the results. Therefore, the study has the general objective of evaluating how the mentioned hybrid methodology proposal can make the protocol derived from ICD-10 more efficient, providing agility to diagnosing Autism Spectrum Disorder by observing a minor symptom. The study database covers thousands of cases of people who, once diagnosed, obtained government assistance in Brazil.
