34988164|t|ATF3: a novel biomarker for the diagnosis of acute kidney injury after cardiac surgery.
34988164|a|BACKGROUND: To investigate the expression of ATF3 in the blood and urine of adult patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) surgery and to identify the changes during the perioperative period of CPB, and to determine whether ATF3 can be used as a biological marker for the early diagnosis of acute kidney injury (AKI). METHODS: We prospectively studied 83 patients who underwent elective CPB (ECB). Relevant clinical information was collected. Blood and urine samples were collected preoperatively (T0) and at 2 h (T1), 6 h (T2), 12 h (T3), 24 h (T4), and 48 h (T5) after surgery, and grouped according to the occurrence of AKI. The changes in ATF3 levels were observed, and the accuracy of the diagnosis of AKI was compared through receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Factors influencing the expression of ATF3 at baseline were also analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 83 adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery with CPB were included, and 42 of them developed AKI. The levels of serum ATF3 (sATF3) in the AKI group were significantly higher than those in the non-AKI group 24 h after surgery, and the difference was statistically significant (662.62+-204.72 vs. 586.93+-175.87; P=0.0345). Urinary ATF3 (uATF3) increased significantly 6 h after surgery, and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) for diagnosing AKI 12 h after surgery was 0.691 (95% CI: 0.576-0.807). When uATF3 was higher than 1,216 pg/mL, the sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of AKI were 0.43 and 0.85, respectively. On the other hand, the preoperative expression of ATF3 was negatively correlated with the preoperative creatinine level, but not affected by the patient's age, weight, gender, preoperative cardiac function, preoperative blood routine examination and liver function. CONCLUSIONS: ATF3 can be expressed early in the blood and urine of patients after CPB and can be used as a diagnostic marker for AKI after CPB in adult patients.
