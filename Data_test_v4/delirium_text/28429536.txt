28429536|t|alpha-Mangostin decreases beta-amyloid peptides production via modulation of amyloidogenic pathway.
28429536|a|AIMS: beta-amyloid (Abeta) aggregation and deposition play a central role in the pathogenic process of Alzheimer's disease (AD). alpha-Mangostin (alpha-M), a polyphenolic xanthone, have been shown to dissociate Abeta oligomers. In this study, we further investigated the effect of alpha-M on Abeta production and its molecular mechanism. METHODS: The Abeta and soluble amyloid precursor protein alpha (sAPPalpha) in culture medium of cortical neurons were measured by ELISA. The activities of alpha-, beta-, and gamma-secretases were assayed, and the interaction between alpha-M and beta- or gamma-secretases was simulated by molecular docking. RESULTS: alpha-M significantly decreased Abeta40 and Abeta42 production. alpha-M did not affect the expression of enzymes involved in nonamyloidogenic and amyloidogenic pathways, but significantly decreased the activities of beta-secretase and likely gamma-secretase with IC50 13.22 nmol L-1 and 16.98 nmol L-1 , respectively. Molecular docking demonstrated that alpha-M interacted with beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 and presenilin 1 to interfere with their active sites. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that alpha-M decreases Abeta production through inhibiting activities of beta-secretase and likely gamma-secretase in the amyloidogenic pathway. The current data together with previous study indicated that alpha-M could be a novel neuroprotective agent through intervention of multiple pathological processes of AD.
