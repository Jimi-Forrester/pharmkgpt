36168562|t|The factors associated with progression of tricuspid regurgitation after left-sided double valve replacement in propensity score matched analysis.
36168562|a|Background: This study aims to investigate the association of progression of tricuspid regurgitation following double-valve replacement by comparing the tricuspid valve repair and no repair groups, and to analyze outcomes of patients with non-repaired mild-to-moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Methods: Between January 2014 and September 2017, a total of 157 patients (74 males, 83 females; mean age: 51.7+-13.7 years; range, 18 to 78 years) who underwent aortic and mitral valve replacements with/without concomitant tricuspid valve repair were retrospectively analyzed. The patients were divided into two groups: no-repair (n=78) and repair groups (n=79). The primary outcome measure was development of more than moderate tricuspid regurgitation during follow-up. Results: The data were evaluated according to propensity score matched analysis. The progression of tricuspid regurgitation was significantly increased in the no-repair group (p=0.006). Rheumatic etiology was independently associated with the presence of postoperative moderateto- severe tricuspid regurgitation (p=0.004, odds ratio: 3.40). There was no statistically significant difference between the groups in terms of the potential complications and mortality and survival rates. A multivariable subgroup analysis for the baseline mild-to-moderate tricuspid regurgitation without repair showed that rheumatic etiology was an independent factor for the progression of postoperative tricuspid regurgitation (p=0.01). Conclusion: Our study results demonstrated that rheumatic etiology was an independent marker for increased tricuspid regurgitation and it was also independently associated with increased tricuspid regurgitation in patients with mild-to-moderate non-repaired patients. The degree of tricuspid regurgitation was improved in the repair group during follow-up.
