37788076|t|Prevalence and risk factors of subsyndromal delirium among postoperative patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis.
37788076|a|AIM: The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence and risk factors for subsyndromal delirium in the postoperative patient. DESIGN: A systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: The Review Manager 5.3 statistics platform and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale were used for quality evaluation. DATA SOURCES: The following databases were searched: PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library, Scopus and EBSCO from January 2000 to December 2021. Additional sources were found by looking at relevant articles' citations. RESULTS: A total of 1744 titles were originally identified, and five studies including 962 patients were included in the systematic review, with a pooled prevalence of postoperative subsyndromal delirium (PSSD) of 30% (95% CI: 0.28-0.32). Significant risk variables for PSSD were older age, low levels of education (<=9 years), cognitive impairment, higher comorbidity score, and the duration of operation. CONCLUSION: PSSD is prevalent and is associated with a variety of risk factors as well as low academic performance. IMPACT: Identification and clinical management of patients with PSSD should be improved. Future research on PSSD risk factors should look at a wider range of intraoperative and postoperative risk factors that can be changed. PATIENT AND PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: No Patient or Public Contribution.
