32660593|a|BACKGROUND: Malnutrition is a common and modifiable risk factor for postoperative complications and adverse outcomes in orthopedics. The purpose of this study was to identify biomarkers of malnutrition in patients undergoing elective total knee arthroplasty (TKA) that are predictive of adverse in-hospital postoperative complications, to facilitate the identification of at-risk patients for nutritional optimization before surgery. METHODS: A total of 624 patients who underwent elective TKA between 2013 and 2017 were evaluated; potential biomarkers of preoperative malnutrition, including hypoalbuminemia (serum albumin < 3.5 g/dL), total lymphocyte count (TLC < 1500 cells/mm3), and body mass index (BMI), were assessed for any association with in-hospital postoperative complications. RESULTS: The prevalence of hypoalbuminemia, low TLC, overweight, obesity class I, and obesity class II were, respectively 2.72%, 33.4%, 14.8%, 44.5%, and 26.9%. There was a significant association between hypoalbuminemia and obesity class II (BMI >= 30.0 kg/m2) with rates of peri-prosthetic joint infection, and no significant association between such complications and low TLC, overweight, or obesity class I. Logistic regression analysis showed that patients with hypoalbuminemia or being in obesity class II with gouty arthritis were more likely to suffer from peri-prosthetic joint infection. CONCLUSIONS: Hypoalbuminemia and obesity class II together is a reliable biomarker of preoperative malnutrition for predicting peri-prosthetic joint infection after elective TKA, whereas low TLC, overweight, and obesity class I were not significantly associated with an increased risk of such complications.
