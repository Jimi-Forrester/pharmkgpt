26650044|t|Pro-Resolving Lipid Mediators Improve Neuronal Survival and Increase Abeta42 Phagocytosis.
26650044|a|Inflammation in the brain is a prominent feature in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent studies suggest that chronic inflammation can be a consequence of failure to resolve the inflammation. Resolution of inflammation is mediated by a family of lipid mediators (LMs), and the levels of these specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) are reduced in the hippocampus of those with AD. In the present study, we combined analysis of LMs in the entorhinal cortex (ENT) from AD patients with in vitro analysis of their direct effects on neurons and microglia. We probed ENT, an area affected early in AD pathogenesis, by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS), and found that the levels of the SPMs maresin 1 (MaR1), protectin D1 (PD1), and resolvin (Rv) D5, were lower in ENT of AD patients as compared to age-matched controls, while levels of the pro-inflammatory prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) were higher in AD. In vitro studies showed that lipoxin A4 (LXA4), MaR1, resolvin D1 (RvD1), and protectin DX (PDX) exerted neuroprotective activity, and that MaR1 and RvD1 down-regulated beta-amyloid (Abeta)42-induced inflammation in human microglia. MaR1 exerted a stimulatory effect on microglial uptake of Abeta42. Our findings give further evidence for a disturbance of the resolution pathway in AD, and indicate that stimulating this pathway is a promising treatment strategy for AD.
