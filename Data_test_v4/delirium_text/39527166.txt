39527166|a|BACKGROUND: Conducted energy weapons (CEW, TASER) are increasingly used by law enforcement agencies in Germany. The CEWs are intended to reduce violence against police officers and to reduce moderate to severe injuries of police officers and aggressors. The delivery of repetitive electrical impulses causes neuromuscular paralysis and incapacitation; however, there are safety concerns due to deaths related to CEWs. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this article is to provide an overview of the medical risks associated with the use of CEWs. METHODS: A literature search was carried out using relevant databases. RESULTS: The CEWs offer a good overall safety profile but in rare cases can have serious or life-threatening health risks. These include injuries to vulnerable body regions and falls. Myocardial capture and malignant arrhythmia can be triggered in animal experiments. The cause of death following the use of a conducted energy device (CED) can often not be clearly attributed due to competing causes; however, in studies with volunteers arrhythmia has not been observed so far. Overall, the risk of life-threatening cardiac arrhythmia in humans appears to be low, although still present. Particularly vulnerable risk groups include children, people with a history of mental illness or with intoxication, pregnant women and cardiac device wearers. CONCLUSION: Even though in principle CEWs can trigger malignant arrhythmia, the risk is low and the causality of death after CEW deployment often remains unclear. In the medical care of patients after CEW use, comorbidities such as intoxication or mental illness must be considered.
