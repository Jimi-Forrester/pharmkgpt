30061177|a|Uranium tailings (UT) are formed as a byproduct of uranium mining and are of potential risk to living organisms. In the present study, we sought to identify potential biomarkers associated with chronic exposure to low dose rate gamma radiation originating from UT. We exposed C57BL/6J mice to 30, 100, or 250 muGy/h of gamma radiation originating from UT samples. Nine animals were included in each treatment group. We observed that the liver central vein was significantly enlarged in mice exposed to dose rates of 100 and 250 muGy/h, when compared with nonirradiated controls. Using proteomic techniques, we identified 18 proteins that were differentially expressed (by a factor of at least 2.5-fold) in exposed animals, when compared with controls. We chose glycine N-methyltransferase (GNMT), glutathione S-transferase A3 (GSTA3), and nucleophosmin (NPM) for further investigations. Our data showed that GNMT (at 100 and 250 muGy/h) and NPM (at 250 muGy/h) were up-regulated, and GSTA3 was down-regulated in all of the irradiated groups, indicating that their expression is modulated by chronic gamma radiation exposure. GNMT, GSTA3, and NPM may therefore prove useful as biomarkers of gamma radiation exposure associated with UT. The mechanisms underlying those changes need to be further studied.
