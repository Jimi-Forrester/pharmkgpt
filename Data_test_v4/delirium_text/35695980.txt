35695980|a|The striatum is especially vulnerable to HIV-1 infection, with medium spiny neurons (MSNs) exhibiting marked synaptodendritic damage that can be exacerbated by opioid use disorder. Despite known structural defects in MSNs co-exposed to HIV-1 Tat and opioids, the pathophysiological sequelae of sustained HIV-1 exposure and acute comorbid effects of opioids on dopamine D1 and D2 receptor-expressing (D1 and D2) MSNs are unknown. To address this question, Drd1-tdTomato- or Drd2-eGFP-expressing reporter and conditional HIV-1 Tat transgenic mice were interbred. MSNs in ex vivo slices from male mice were assessed by whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology and filled with biocytin to explore the functional and structural effects of progressive Tat and acute morphine exposure. Although the excitability of both D1 and D2 MSNs increased following 48 h of Tat exposure, D1 MSN firing rates decreased below control (Tat-) levels following 2 weeks and 1 month of Tat exposure but returned to control levels after 2 months. D2 neurons continued to display Tat-dependent increases in excitability at 2 weeks, but also returned to control levels following 1 and 2 months of Tat induction. Acute morphine exposure increased D1 MSN excitability irrespective of the duration of Tat exposure, while D2 MSNs were variably affected. That D1 and D2 MSN excitability would return to control levels was unexpected since both subpopulations displayed significant synaptodendritic degeneration and pathologic phospho-tau-Thr205 accumulation following 2 months of Tat induction. Thus, despite frank morphologic damage, D1 and D2 MSNs uniquely adapt to sustained Tat and acute morphine insults.
