37993482|t|Lemon extract supported green synthesis of bimetallic CuO/Ag nanoporous materials for sensitive detection of vitamin D3.
37993482|a|In modern era, deficiency of Vitamin D3 is predominantly due to limited exposure to sunlight and UV radiation resulting from indoor lifestyles. Several studies have revealed that vitamin D deficiency can lead to chronic vascular inflammation, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, congestive left ventricular hypertrophy, and heart failure. This study introduces a green synthesis of novel bimetallic nanoporous composite, CuO/Ag using lemon extract. The synthesized nanoporous material, CuO/Ag@lemon extract was characterized using several analytical techniques, including X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). The CuO/Ag@lemon extract nanoparticles were immobilized on glassy carbon electrode (GCE) to prepare modified CuO/Ag@lemon extract-GCE interface. The electrocatalytic and electrochemical properties investigation was carried out on the modified electrode. using cyclic voltammetry (CV), differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), and amperometry for detecting of Vitamin D3. The DPV method displayed a linear response range of 0.02-22.5 microM with a detection limit of 2.62 nM, while the amperometric method showed a broader linear range of 0.25-23.25 microM with a detection limit of 2.70 nM with 82% modified electrode stability. The designed electrode exhibited a positive response to the inclusion of Vitamin D3 with electro-oxidation, reaching steady-state within 3.4 s, with 87% reproducibility within a day. The proposed method offers a rapid and sensitive platform for detection of Vitamin D3 with minimal interference from other molecules. The early diagnosis of Vitamin D3 deficiency using modified electrodes allows for early treatment, thereby preventing severe health complications.
