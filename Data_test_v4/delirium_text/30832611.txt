30832611|a|BACKGROUND: Total four influenza pandemics have happened since twentieth century, and currently influenza is in the seasonal epidemic around the world, with a sharp increase in its incidence each year. As an effective treatment of influenza infection, the use of oseltamivir is climbing globally. However, there have been reports of neuropsychiatric events associated with the drug, mainly in young patients and males. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of oseltamivir-associated neuropsychiatric events occurring in an patient over 50-year-old. CASE PRESENTATION: Here we present the case of a 57-year-old Chinese female with H3N2 influenza infection who developed abnormal psychiatric symptoms after administration of high doses of oseltamivir. The patient recovered completely within the cessation of oseltamivir. CONCLUSIONS: We hope that our case report will lead clinicians to be mindful about oseltamivir's potential neuropsychiatric side effects, and to pay special attention to each patient's mental state, both in children and adults.
