25461285|a|The accumulation of extracellular amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles in the brain are two major neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). It is thought that an equilibrium exists between Abeta in the brain and in the peripheral blood and thus, it was hypothesized that shifting this equilibrium towards the blood by enhancing peripheral clearance might reduce Abeta levels in the brain: the 'sink effect'. We tested this hypothesis by intraperitoneally injecting APP/PS1 transgenic mice with small unilamellar vesicles containing either phosphatidic acid or cardiolipin over 3weeks. This treatment reduced significantly the amount of Abeta in the plasma and the brain levels of Abeta were lighter affected. Nevertheless, this dosing regimen did modulate tau phosphorylation and glycogen synthase kinase 3 activities in the brain, suggesting that the targeting of circulating Abeta may be therapeutically relevant in AD. FROM THE CLINICAL EDITOR: Intraperitoneal injection of small unilamellar vesicles containing phosphatidic acid or cardiolipin significantly reduced the amount of amyloid-beta (Ass) peptide in the plasma in a rodent model. Brain levels of Ass were also affected - although to a lesser extent - suggesting that targeting of circulating Ass may be therapeutically relevant of Alzheimer's disease.
