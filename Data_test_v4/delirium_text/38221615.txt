38221615|t|Possible unusual presentation of opioid side effect in a child: a case report.
38221615|a|Atypical presentations are commonly encountered in the Pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) but having a high index of suspicion is crucial to prevent or treat severe and life-threatening conditions. This case describes the clinical presentation and course of a 14-month-old girl with congenital heart disease who was admitted to the PICU after cardiac repair and remained agitated, irritable, in hysteria and delirium despite adequate sedation. Different measures to relieve her condition were attempted but to no avail. All the common causes of this atypical presentation including pain, ventilator induced agitation, low cardiac output syndrome (LCOS), opioid side effects, toxicity, opioid induced neurotoxicity (OIN) as well as withdrawal syndrome were ruled out. However, the use of naloxone as a last resort after exhausting all the other options has led to immediate and successful reversal of her symptoms.
