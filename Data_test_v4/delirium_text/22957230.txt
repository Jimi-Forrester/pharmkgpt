22957230|t|Spontaneous EEG-Functional MRI in Mesial Temporal Lobe Epilepsy: Implications for the Neural Correlates of Consciousness.
22957230|a|The combination of electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been shown to have great potential for providing a greater understanding of normal and diseased states in both human and animal studies. Simultaneous EEG-fMRI is particularly well suited for the study of epilepsy in that it may reveal the neurobiology of ictal and interictal epileptiform discharges and noninvasively localize epileptogenic foci. Spontaneous, coherent fluctuations of neuronal activity and the coupled hemodynamic responses have also been shown to provide diagnostic markers of disease, extending our understanding of intrinsically structured ongoing brain activity. Following a short summary of the hardware and software development of simultaneous EEG-fMRI, this paper reviews a unified framework of integrating neuronal and hemodynamic processes during epileptic seizures and discusses the role and impact of spontaneous activity in the mesial temporal lobe epilepsies with particular emphasis on the neural and physiological correlates of consciousness.
