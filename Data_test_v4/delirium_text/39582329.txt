39582329|a|BACKGROUND: Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery brings significant cardiac benefits but also risks post-operative complications, including cognitive impairments and infections. MATERIALS & METHODS: We analyzed 108 patient records between 2011 and 2021 at the Princess Muna Al-Hussein Cardiac Center, Irbid, Jordan. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of postoperative events. RESULTS: Few patients (8.3%) faced complications like stroke and infections, with age and ICU stay length as significant risk factors. Patients with complications often experienced left ventricular impairments and required inotropic support. CONCLUSION: The study highlights the need for understanding CABG surgery complications to improve outcomes, emphasizing preventive care and personalized follow-up.
