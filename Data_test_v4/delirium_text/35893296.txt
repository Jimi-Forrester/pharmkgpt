35893296|t|Protective Effect of Resveratrol against Hypoxia-Induced Neural Oxidative Stress.
35893296|a|Oxidative stress plays an important role in brain aging and in neurodegenerative diseases. New therapeutic agents are necessary to cross the blood-brain barrier and target disease pathogenesis without causing disagreeable side effects. Resveratrol (RSV) may act as a neuroprotective compound, but little is known about its potential in improving the cognitive and metabolic aspects that are associated with neurodegenerative diseases. The objective of this study was to investigate the protective effects and the underlying mechanisms of RSV against hypoxia-induced oxidative stress in neuronal PC12 cells. For the induction of the hypoxia model, the cells were exposed to oxygen-deprived gas in a hypoxic chamber. Cell cycle and apoptosis were analyzed by a fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis. The intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) level was analyzed by using dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFDA) and 5-(and-6)-chloromethyl-2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate, acetyl ester (CM-H2DCFDA) tests. The expression of activated caspase-3, -9, Bcl-2, Bax, p53, and SOD was investigated by a Western blot analysis. We found that hypoxia reduced PC12 viability by inducing apoptosis, while RSV treatment attenuated the ROS-induced damage by reducing caspase-3, -9, and the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. The RSV treated groups were found to improve cellular health, with a 7.41% increase in the S phase population in the 10 microM group, compared to the control. Hence, RSV has a protective effect in neuronal cells and may halt the cell cycle in the G1/S phase to repair the intracellular damage. Therefore, RSV could be a good candidate to act as an antioxidant and promising preventive therapeutic agent in neurodegenerative diseases for personalized medicine.
