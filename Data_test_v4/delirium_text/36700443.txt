36700443|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) and primary progressive aphasia (PPA) are age-related neurodegenerative diseases characterized by a slowly progressive cognitive decline that significantly impacts functional autonomy. Cognitive interventions remain one of the most useful management perspectives to help patients compensate for their cognitive and functional deficits in everyday life. Errorless learning represents a set of principles and methods aimed at eliminating or minimizing errors in a learning context, which was initially applied to patients with an amnesic syndrome. In this article, we examine the effectiveness of this learning principle in the context of AD and PPA. Based on current data from the literature, errorless learning appears to be useful in (re)learning new information or procedural skills in AD and APP, such as relearning names or certain independent activities of daily living. In addition, the benefits of errorless learning are maintained at follow-up. There are, however, discrepancies in the results between studies which could reflect differences in the learning methods employed and in the parameters of the interventions. In conclusion, such interventions should primarily target learning that is useful for patients and that allows them to preserve their autonomy longer and improve their quality of life.
