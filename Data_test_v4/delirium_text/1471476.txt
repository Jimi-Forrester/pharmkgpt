1471476|t|The coexistence of Alzheimer's disease and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in a patient with dementia of long duration.
1471476|a|We report here a 75-year-old-male with a slowly progressive dementia of 5-year duration along with a rapid exacerbation of symptoms in the terminal 3 months. Neuropathological examinations revealed findings consistent with conspicuous Alzheimer's disease and mild Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). The plaque amyloid was exclusively composed of beta-protein. The immunohistochemistry of prion protein using hydrolytic autoclaving pretreatment showed diffuse gray matter stainings in the sections of both the cerebral and cerebellar cortices. This method was thus considered useful in confirming the diagnosis of CJD for this case.
