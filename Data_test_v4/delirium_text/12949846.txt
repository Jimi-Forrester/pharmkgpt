12949846|t|Factors influencing intentions to seek a cognitive status examination: a study based on the Health Belief Model.
12949846|a|AIMS: The aim of the present study was to examine the factors influencing intention to seek a cognitive status evaluation in the presence of memory problems. METHODS: A convenience sample of 186 community-dwelling adults (mean age=64) were interviewed face-to-face using measures derived from the Health Belief Model. RESULTS: Participants' intentions to be examined were higher when presented with scenarios describing family history of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Perceived barriers and cues to action were significant predictors of intention, accounting for 24% of the variance. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest the need to develop effective educational strategies to improve knowledge about AD and decision-making concerning cognitive status examinations.
