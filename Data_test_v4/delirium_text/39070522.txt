39070522|t|An Outline on the Advancements in Surgical Management of Osteoporosis-Associated Fractures.
39070522|a|Osteoporosis significantly impairs bone density and increases fracture risk, representing a substantial global health challenge. The effectiveness of traditional treatments such as calcium supplementation and exercise in completely preventing fractures is limited. This review explores recent advancements in surgical techniques and treatment modalities to manage osteoporotic fractures better and improve patient outcomes. Osteoporotic fractures demand specialized surgical techniques due to compromised bone quality. Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty are minimally invasive procedures that provide rapid pain relief and structural support using bone cement. While vertebroplasty is effective, it carries risks of cement leakage and new fractures. Kyphoplasty, with added balloon inflation, reduces leakage risk and improves vertebral height restoration but is costlier. Cement-augmented screws enhance fixation but can increase adjacent fracture risk and pose long-term complications. Surgical advancements encompass robotic-assisted surgery, offering precision and accelerated recovery, alongside biologic agents like bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), which enhance bone healing while reducing secondary interventions and eliminating donor site morbidity. Bone graft substitutes such as calcium phosphate cements enhance biomechanical compatibility, decrease morbidity, and reduce fracture loss and pain. Balloon kyphoplasty aids in height restoration and pain relief and diminishes the risk of subsequent vertebral fractures. Bioglass scaffolds promote bone regeneration by improving bone mineral density and lowering the incidence of new fractures. Optimal perioperative care, including patient selection, nutritional management, and early mobilization strategies, is crucial for mitigating risks in vulnerable populations. While current surgical interventions provide significant pain relief and functional benefits, ongoing research and multidisciplinary collaboration are crucial to prospectively refine these techniques and reduce the burden of osteoporosis. New technologies, such as tissue engineering and gene editing, hold potential for future treatment paradigms.
