24858241|a|It is well known that misfolded peptides/proteins can play a role in processes of normal ageing and in the pathogenesis of many diseases including Alzheimer's disease. Previously, we evaluated samples of cerebrospinal fluid from patients with Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis by means of thioflavin-T-based fluorescence. We observed attenuated effects of magnetite nanoparticles operated via anti-aggregation actions on peptides/proteins from patients with Alzheimer's disease but not from those with multiple sclerosis when compared to age-related controls. In this study, we have evaluated the in vitro effects of anti-aggregation operating ferrofluid and phytoalexin spirobrassinin in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease. We have found significant differences in native fluorescence (lambda excitation = 440 nm, lambda emission = 485 nm) of samples among particular groups (young controls < multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease < old controls). Differences among groups were observed also in thioflavin-T-based fluorescence (young controls = multiple sclerosis < Alzheimer's disease < old controls) and the most marked change from native to thioflavin-T-based fluorescence was found in young controls (28-40 years old people). Both ferrofluid and spirobrassinin evoked drops in thioflavin-T-based fluorescence; however, ferrofluid was more efficient in old controls (54-75 years old people) and spirobrassinin in multiple sclerosis patients, both compared to young controls. The results are discussed especially in relation to aggregated peptides/proteins and liposoluble fluorescent products of lipid peroxidation. Based on the significant effect of spirobrassinin in vitro, we suggest that spirobrassinin may be of therapeutic value in multiple sclerosis.
