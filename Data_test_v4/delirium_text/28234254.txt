28234254|t|APOEe4 Genotype, Amyloid, and Clinical Disease Progression in Cognitively Normal Older Adults.
28234254|a|BACKGROUND: In cognitively normal (CN) older adults, carriage of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) e4 allele is associated with increased risk for dementia of the Alzheimer type (AD-dementia). It is unclear whether this occurs solely through APOEe4 increasing amyloid-beta (Abeta) accumulation or through processes independent of Abeta. OBJECTIVE: To determine the extent and nature to which APOEe4 increases risk for clinical disease progression in CN older adults. METHODS: Data from the total (n = 765) and Abeta-imaged (n = 423) CN cohort in the Australian Imaging, Biomarker and Lifestyle (AIBL) Study of Ageing was analyzed using Cox proportional hazard models to estimate e4 risk for clinical disease progression over a 72-month follow-up. RESULTS: With Abeta status unknown and risk from demographic characteristics controlled, e4 carriage increased risk for clinical disease progression over 72 months by 2.66 times compared to risk of non-e4 carriage. Re-analysis with Abeta status included showed that abnormally high Abeta increased risk for clinical disease progression over 72 months by 2.11 times compared to risk of low Abeta. However, with Abeta level known, e4 carriage was no longer predictive of clinical disease progression. CONCLUSION: In CN older adults, the risk of e4 for clinical disease progression occurs through the effect of e4 increasing Abeta levels.
