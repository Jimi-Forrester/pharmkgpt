34670285|t|[Excited Delirium Syndrome (ExDS): emergence and emergency management].
34670285|a|The Excited Delirium Syndrome (ExDS) is a state of maximum psychophysiological excitation far beyond mental agitation. Patients themselves are at an acute risk and put others at a high risk. We present data from eleven patients and a short literature review. Results: 9 of 11 patients were acutely intoxicated (alcohol, magic mushrooms, THC, ecstacy, or "flakka"). Eight had a history of substance abuse and 4 of other mental illness. None of the patients responded to attempts at verbal de-escalation. Seven had significant injuries at the time of admission to the hospital. The aggressive "psychiatric" presentation of ExDS can lead to vital risks being overlooked (hyperexcitation, acidosis, rhabdomyolysis, hypoxemia, and cardiovascular decompensation), which may even be increased by severe methods of restraint (hogtie; positional asphyxia). Early recognition of ExDS and its risks, comprehensive management and the prevention of inappropriate treatment will help to reduce fatal outcomes.
