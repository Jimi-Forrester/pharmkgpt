32761882|a|INTRODUCTION: Despite acupuncture having been successfully used for the clinical treatment for vascular dementia in Asian countries for centuries, scientifically rigorous evidence is lacking for standardizing therapeutic parameters. To address this problem, it is necessary to examine the parameters of acupuncture using scientific methodology. The goal of this study is to investigate various therapeutic parameters, including manipulation, retention, and frequency of acupuncture, and their contribution to the efficacy of acupuncture in VD. METHODS: We selected needle retention, treatment frequency, and needle rotation as the parameters. Acupuncture was performed on acupoints ST36 and GV20. Morris Water Maze was selected to assess the effect of acupuncture on cognitive function and Nissl staining indicated the hippocampal neuronal damage in VD rats. RESULTS: Acupuncture stimulation resulted in a significant improvement in the spatial learning and memory deficit and reversed neuronal damage in the hippocampus. The approach of needle retention with 10 min, rotation for 30s every 5 min or daily treatment with acupuncture was more effective than nonretention, nonrotation, or alternative day treatment group. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that needle retention, treatment frequency, and needle manipulation are important factors in improving the learning and memory as well as reducing the neuronal damage of the hippocampus in a rat VD model. These findings strongly suggest that the appropriate therapeutic parameters could significant influence the efficiency in animal experiments.
