6149127|t|Assessment of adverse drug reactions in psychiatric hospitals.
6149127|a|A system for monitoring adverse drug reactions (ADR) in psychiatric inpatients was introduced in psychiatric hospitals in the FRG in May 1979. It consists of intensive drug monitoring (IDM) and a so-called "organized spontaneous reporting system" (OSR). ADR are rated separately according to impact on therapy and probability of causal relationship. With IDM all ADR (Grades I-III) are assessed in a randomly selected sample of inpatients. With OSR only ADR leading to discontinuation of the drugs in question (= ADR Grade III) are assessed. In 406 drug-treated inpatients monitored by IDM in the psychiatric hospitals of Berlin and Munich from May 1979 to Dec. 1981, ADR were observed in 60,4%. In 15% of IDM-patients ADR led to discontinuation of the drugs in question; with OSR the relative frequency of these Grade III ADR was 9,0% in 5096 patients monitored throughout the entire period. Life-threatening events were observed in 1,2% of patients undergoing IDM as well as 1.2% of those undergoing OSR. The most frequently observed ADR by IDM were sedation, extrapyramidal signs, disturbances of the autonomic nervous system and increase in transaminases, and by OSR Parkinsonism, akathisia, sedation, toxic delirium and increased transaminases. The relative frequency of Grade III ADR was similar for neuroleptics and antidepressants (5,4% and 5,3% in OSR); a very low relative frequency of ADR Grade III was found for tranquilizers and hypnotics (0,7% and 0,2%). Methodological aspects of this drug monitoring system are discussed in the light of current literature.
