36756015|t|Bulbar Artery Injury With Bladder Hematoma and Severe Anemia Due to Traumatic Foley Catheter Removal.
36756015|a|This case is described with the aim of informing about the high-level suspicion of bladder or urethral injuries in patients with traumatic Foley removal and their prolonged bleeding that should alert clinicians for a prompt urological intervention. A patient was initially admitted to the ICU with delirium and organ dysfunction due to an overdose of drugs. On the second day of his admission, he unintentionally removed his Foley catheter, which led to a course of gross hematuria. He was managed conservatively. After three weeks of hospitalization and stabilization, his profuse, constant bleeding was finally addressed. CT and ultrasound imaging was performed and revealed that his bladder was at an abnormal size and filled with blood. A cystoscopy and a fulguration of the bulbar artery were completed. Quick relief and recovery were noted after the procedure was finalized.
