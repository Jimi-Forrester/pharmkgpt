37296586|t|Oxygen-Glucose Deprivation in Organotypic Hippocampal Cultures Leads to Cytoskeleton Rearrangement and Immune Activation: Link to the Potential Pathomechanism of Ischaemic Stroke.
37296586|a|Ischaemic stroke is characterized by a sudden loss of blood circulation to an area of the brain, resulting in a corresponding loss of neurologic function. As a result of this process, neurons in the ischaemic core are deprived of oxygen and trophic substances and are consequently destroyed. Tissue damage in brain ischaemia results from a complex pathophysiological cascade comprising various distinct pathological events. Ischaemia leads to brain damage by stimulating many processes, such as excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, inflammation, acidotoxicity, and apoptosis. Nevertheless, less attention has been given to biophysical factors, including the organization of the cytoskeleton and the mechanical properties of cells. Therefore, in the present study, we sought to evaluate whether the oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) procedure, which is a commonly accepted experimental model of ischaemia, could affect cytoskeleton organization and the paracrine immune response. The abovementioned aspects were examined ex vivo in organotypic hippocampal cultures (OHCs) subjected to the OGD procedure. We measured cell death/viability, nitric oxide (NO) release, and hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF-1alpha) levels. Next, the impact of the OGD procedure on cytoskeletal organization was evaluated using combined confocal fluorescence microscopy (CFM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Concurrently, to find whether there is a correlation between biophysical properties and the immune response, we examined the impact of OGD on the levels of crucial ischaemia cytokines (IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-18, TNF-alpha, IL-10, IL-4) and chemokines (CCL3, CCL5, CXCL10) in OHCs and calculated Pearsons' and Spearman's rank correlation coefficients. The results of the current study demonstrated that the OGD procedure intensified cell death and nitric oxide release and led to the potentiation of HIF-1alpha release in OHCs. Moreover, we presented significant disturbances in the organization of the cytoskeleton (actin fibers, microtubular network) and cytoskeleton-associated protein 2 (MAP-2), which is a neuronal marker. Simultaneously, our study provided new evidence that the OGD procedure leads to the stiffening of OHCs and a malfunction in immune homeostasis. A negative linear correlation between tissue stiffness and branched IBA1 positive cells after the OGD procedure suggests the pro-inflammatory polarization of microglia. Moreover, the negative correlation of pro- and positive anti-inflammatory factors with actin fibers density indicates an opposing effect of the immune mediators on the rearrangement of cytoskeleton induced by OGD procedure in OHCs. Our study constitutes a basis for further research and provides a rationale for integrating biomechanical and biochemical methods in studying the pathomechanism of stroke-related brain damage. Furthermore, presented data pointed out the interesting direction of proof-of-concept studies, in which follow-up may establish new targets for brain ischemia therapy.
