34386234|a|The high morbidity and mortality of neuroinflammatory diseases drives significant interest in understanding the underlying mechanisms involved in the innate and adaptive immune response of the central nervous system (CNS). Diagnostic biomarkers are important to define treatable neuroinflammation. Metabolomics is a rapidly evolving research area offering novel insights into metabolic pathways, and elucidation of reliable metabolites as biomarkers for diseases. This review focuses on the emerging literature regarding the detection of neuroinflammation using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) metabolomics in human cohort studies. Studies of classic neuroinflammatory disorders such as encephalitis, CNS infection and multiple sclerosis confirm the utility of CSF metabolomics. Additionally, studies in neurodegeneration and neuropsychiatry support the emerging potential of CSF metabolomics to detect neuroinflammation in common CNS diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and depression. We demonstrate metabolites in the tryptophan-kynurenine pathway, nitric oxide pathway, neopterin and major lipid species show moderately consistent ability to differentiate patients with neuroinflammation from controls. Integration of CSF metabolomics into clinical practice is warranted to improve recognition and treatment of neuroinflammation.
