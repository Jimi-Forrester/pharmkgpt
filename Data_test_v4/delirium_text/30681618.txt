30681618|t|Improvement in quality of life of Chinese chronic heart failure patients with neuropsychiatric complications over 12-months post-treatment with metoprolol.
30681618|a|Psychological disorders, such as depression and anxiety, are known to be associated with chronic heart failure (CHF). The present study was conducted to evaluate the effect of mental status on quality of life (QoL) in metoprolol treated CHF patients with depression, anxiety, and burn-out.This single-center prospective study was conducted between February 2013 and April 2016, enrolled CHF patients (resting heart rate >80 bpm) with depression, anxiety, and burn out at baseline. Hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS) and Copenhagen burnout inventory (CBI) were used to assess the depression-anxiety status and burn-out status, respectively. Change in QoL was evaluated as the endpoint at 1st, 3rd, 6th, and 12th month from baseline using Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLHFQ) and short form-8 (SF-8) scales. A student t test was used to determine the change and P value < .05 was considered statistically significant. One hundred fifty-four patients were enrolled (median age 66 years; 65.58% males) and divided into 8 groups based on the HADS and CBI scores at baseline. Overall, the mean SF8 score and MLHFQ scores in different mental status groups showed a significant improvement (P < .05) in QoL from baseline to 12th month, with no significant difference reported between the groups. With regard to the follow-up periods, there was a deterioration in QoL until 3rd month, after which there was a significant improvement (P < .05).There was a significant improvement in QoL in metoprolol treated CHF patients with depression, anxiety, and burn-out.
