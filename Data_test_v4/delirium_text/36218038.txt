36218038|a|BACKGROUND: Recent studies have shown that ubiquitin-mediated cell apoptosis can modulate protein interaction and involve in the progress of oocyte maturation and spermatogenesis. As one of the key regulators involved in ubiquitin signal, ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCHL1) is considered a molecular marker associated with spermatogonia stem cells. However, the function of UCHL1 was wildly reported to regulate various bioecological processes, such as Parkinson's disease, lung cancer, breast cancer and colon cancer, how UCHL1 affects the mammalian reproductive system remains an open question. METHODS: We identified papers through electronic searches of PubMed database from inception to July 2022. RESULTS: Here, we summarize the important function of UCHL1 in controlling mammalian oocyte development, regulating spermatogenesis and inhibiting polyspermy, and we posit the balance of UCHL1 was essential to maintaining reproductive cellular and tissue homeostasis. CONCLUSION: This study considers the 'double-edged sword' role of UCHL1 during gametogenesis and presents new insights into UCHL1 in germ cells.
