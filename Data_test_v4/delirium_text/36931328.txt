36931328|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a degenerative neurological disease in elderly individuals. Subjective cognitive decline (SCD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and further development to dementia (d-AD) are considered to be major stages of the progressive pathological development of AD. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), one of the most important modalities of MRI, can describe the microstructure of white matter through its tensor model. It is widely used in understanding the central nervous system mechanism and finding appropriate potential biomarkers for the early stages of AD. Based on the multilevel analysis methods of DTI (voxelwise, fiberwise and networkwise), we summarized that AD patients mainly showed extensive microstructural damage, structural disconnection and topological abnormalities in the corpus callosum, fornix, and medial temporal lobe, including the hippocampus and cingulum. The diffusion features and structural connectomics of specific regions can provide information for the early assisted recognition of AD. The classification accuracy of SCD and normal controls can reach 92.68% at present. And due to the further changes of brain structure and function, the classification accuracy of MCI, d-AD and normal controls can reach more than 97%. Finally, we summarized the limitations of current DTI-based AD research and propose possible future research directions.
