37565992|a|Potential associations between the risk of neurodegenerative diseases and circulating levels of amino acids have been implied in both experimental research and observational studies. However, because of the confounding and reverse causality, the findings could be biased. We aimed to determine whether circulating amino acid levels have potential effects on the risk of neurodegenerative diseases through a more robust analysis. So, we performed a total of two MR analyses, a discovery two-sample MR analysis, and a replication test, using summary-level genome-wide association study (GWAS) data, both with circulating levels of amino acids as exposure and risk of neurodegenerative diseases as an outcome. The potential causalities between nine amino acids (Glutamine [Glu], Leucine [Leu], Isoleucine [Ile], Phenylalanine [Phe], Valine [Val], Alanine [Ala], Tyrosine [Tyr], Histidine [His], and Glycine [Gly]) and six neurodegenerative disorders (Alzheimer's disease [AD], Parkinson's disease [PD], Multiple sclerosis [MS], Frontotemporal dementia [FTD], Lewy body dementia [DLB], Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [ALS]) were explored in this study. According to the discovery MR analysis, 1 SD. increase in circulating levels of Gln was genetically determined to result in a 13% lower risk of AD (IVW ORSD [95% CI] = 0.872 [0.822, 0.926]; FDR = 7.46 x 10-5 ) while PD risk was decreased to 63% per SD. increase of circulating Leu levels (IVW ORSD [95% CI] = 0.628 [0.467, 0.843]; FDR = 0.021). Results from the replication test provide further evidence of the potential association between circulating Gln levels and AD risk (IVW ORSD [95% CI] = 0.094 [0.028, 0.311]; FDR = 9.98 x 10-4 ). Meanwhile, sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the significant relationships revealed by our two-sample MR outcomes were reliable. Our analyses provided robust evidence of causal associations between circulating levels of Gln and AD risk as well as circulating Leu levels and risk of PD. However, the underlying mechanisms remain to be further investigated.
