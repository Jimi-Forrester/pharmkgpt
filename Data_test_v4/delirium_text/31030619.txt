31030619|a|Objective: Deficits in confrontation naming vary among persons with Alzheimer's disease (AD), including the extent to which phonemic cueing is helpful in generating the target word. This study examined neuropsychological correlates of phonemic cueing benefit and the influential effects of AD severity, estimated premorbid intellectual functioning, and apolipoprotein E genotype status.Method: Participants were 1104 individuals with mild to moderate AD who were administered the Boston Naming Test (BNT) as part of their initial neuropsychological evaluation.Results: Mild AD subjects benefited from phonemic cues significantly more than moderate AD subjects. Individuals with higher estimated premorbid IQ benefited more from phonemic cueing. Differences in phonemic cueing benefit between carriers and noncarriers of the ApoE epsilon4 allele were accounted for by naming ability, with carriers performing better on naming tasks compared to noncarriers. Phonemic cueing benefit uniquely contributed to cognitive performance on some semantic measures, phonemic fluency, and one nonsemantic visuospatial task.Conclusion: Individuals with probable AD who benefit more from phonemic cueing during confrontation naming tend to have higher estimated premorbid IQ and are milder in dementia severity. There is a positive association between phonemic cueing benefit and performance on select semantic measures and verbal fluency. Differences in phonemic cueing benefit between carriers and noncarriers of APOE epsilon4 allele can be explained by spontaneous naming performance. Results suggest complexity of underlying mechanisms involving confrontation naming, phonemic cueing, and lexical access and the factors that influence them.
