38929145|t|Nanotechnological Approaches to Enhance the Potential of alpha-Lipoic Acid for Application in the Clinic.
38929145|a|alpha-lipoic acid is a naturally occurring compound with potent antioxidant properties that helps protect cells and tissues from oxidative stress. Its incorporation into nanoplatforms can affect factors like bioavailability, stability, reactivity, and targeted delivery. Nanoformulations of alpha-lipoic acid can significantly enhance its solubility and absorption, making it more bioavailable. While alpha-lipoic acid can be prone to degradation in its free form, encapsulation within nanoparticles ensures its stability over time, and its release in a controlled and sustained manner to the targeted tissues and cells. In addition, alpha-lipoic acid can be combined with other compounds, such as other antioxidants, drugs, or nanomaterials, to create synergistic effects that enhance their overall therapeutic benefits or hinder their potential cytotoxicity. This review outlines the advantages and drawbacks associated with the use of alpha-lipoic acid, as well as various nanotechnological approaches employed to enhance its therapeutic effectiveness, whether alone or in combination with other bioactive agents. Furthermore, it describes the engineering of alpha-lipoic acid to produce poly(alpha-lipoic acid) nanoparticles, which hold promise as an effective drug delivery system.
