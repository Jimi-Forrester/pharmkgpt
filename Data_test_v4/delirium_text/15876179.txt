15876179|t|Educational needs of general practitioners in palliative care: outcome of a focus group study.
15876179|a|BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to identify the general practitioner's perception of educational needs in palliative care. METHOD: A qualitative study with focus groups was performed. RESULTS: General practitioners estimate palliative care as an important and valuable part of primary care. Nevertheless, they consider their coordinating role as a course with increasing obstacles. Pain, nausea, dysphagia, delirium, insomnia, anxiety, and depression were mentioned frequently as symptoms difficult to deal with in palliative care. Also, psychosocial issues such as communication, bereavement, and defense mechanisms were subject to discussion in the focus groups. Ethical issues such as euthanasia were mentioned as the most complex subject in palliative care. CONCLUSIONS: General practitioners experience difficulties with their coordinating role in palliative care. With more basic knowledge and skills in communication, but also with consultation, their roles as coordinators of palliative care in primary care will improve. Reflection and deepening of ethical values are necessary conditions for an optimal functioning.
