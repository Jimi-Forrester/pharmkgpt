38710639|t|Care trajectories around a first dementia diagnosis in patients with serious mental illness.
38710639|a|AIM: To develop a typology of care trajectories (CTs) 1 year before and after a first dementia diagnosis in individuals aged >=65 years, with prevalent schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. METHODS: This was a longitudinal, retrospective cohort study using health administrative data (1996-2016) from Quebec (Canada). We selected patients aged >=65 years with an incident diagnosis of dementia between 1 January 2014 and 31 December 2016, and a diagnosis of schizophrenia and/or or bipolar disorder. A CT typology was generated by a multidimensional state sequence analysis based on the "6 W" model of CTs. Three dimensions were considered: the care setting ("where"), the reason for consultation ("why") and the specialty of care providers ("which"). RESULTS: In total, 3868 patients were categorized into seven distinct types of CTs, with varying patterns of healthcare use and comorbidities. Healthcare use differed in terms of intensity, but also in its distribution around the diagnosis. For instance, whereas one group showed low healthcare use, healthcare use abruptly increased or decreased after the diagnosis in other groups, or was equally distributed. Other significant differences between CTs included mortality rates and use of long-term care after the diagnosis. Most patients (67%) received their first dementia diagnosis during hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: Our innovative approach provides a unique insight into the complex healthcare patterns of people living with serious mental illness and dementia, and provides an avenue to support data-driven decision-making by highlighting fragility areas in allocating care resources.
