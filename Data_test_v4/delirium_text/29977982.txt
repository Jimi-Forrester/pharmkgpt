29977982|t|An Individualized Music-Based Intervention for Acute Neuropsychiatric Symptoms in Hospitalized Older Adults With Cognitive Impairment: A Prospective, Controlled, Nonrandomized Trial.
29977982|a|Background: Neuropsychiatric symptoms are common features of dementia, and these occur in three fourths of patients on psychogeriatric inpatient units. These symptoms have traditionally been treated with pharmacological agents, but many medications are as likely to harm patients with dementia as to help them. As a result, nonpharmacological interventions are increasingly being investigated as ways to reduce these symptoms. Objective: The current study evaluated the impact of an individualized music-based intervention on agitation, negative mood, positive mood, compliance with care, need for one-on-one nursing staff intervention, and need for PRN medication. Method: Participants in this study were older adults who were admitted to a geriatric behavioral inpatient unit for acute agitation or behavioral disturbance. Twenty patients were in a treatment as usual group and 21 were in the individualized music group. Results: Agitation, negative mood, and positive mood all benefited from the music-based intervention, with resulting large effect sizes. Resisting care level also significantly benefited from the intervention, with a resulting medium effect size. Conclusion: These findings indicate that an easily implemented and reproducible music-based intervention, which is well tolerated and without adverse side effects, can be an effective way to reduce neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with dementia on a hospital unit.
