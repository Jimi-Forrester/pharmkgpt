23963629|t|Psychopharmacology for medically ill adolescents.
23963629|a|Medically ill adolescents are at increased risk for psychological distress and/or functional impairment. However, there are few research studies examining the optimal psychiatric treatments for this population. Psychiatric medication recommendations are largely based on studies of youth with a primary psychiatric disorder, adult studies, hypothesized mechanisms of action, and/or clinical experience. This paper provides evidence-informed recommendations for the psychopharmacological treatment of acutely medically ill adolescents suffering from significant psychological distress and/or functional impairment. Representing the most common problems among medically ill adolescents that are treated with psychiatric medications, recommendations are provided for anxiety and depression; iatrogenic medical trauma, inadequate sleep and insomnia; and, delirium.
