34065267|t|Effect of Saffron Extract on the Hepatotoxicity Induced by Copper Nanoparticles in Male Mice.
34065267|a|BACKGROUND: Nanotechnology application has widespread use in many products. Copper nanoparticles (CuNPs) are widely used in industrial applications. The present study was conducted to investigate the effect of the ethanolic saffron extract (ESE) as a natural antioxidant on the hepatotoxicity induced by CuNPs in male mice. METHODS: The characterization of CuNPs was determined using ultraviolet-visible absorption spectroscopy, particle size analysis, zeta potential, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and electron microscope. The effect of saffron on the hepatotoxicity induced by CuNPs in mice was evaluated by evaluating the survival rate of the mice, oxidative stress, antioxidant capacity, DNA evaluation, as well as its effect on the histology and transmission electron microscope of the liver. RESULTS: The results revealed that all parameters were affected in a dose-dependent manner by CuNPs. These effects have been improved when the treatment of CuNPs is combined with ethanolic saffron extract. CONCLUSIONS: We can conclude that saffron and its bioactive crocin portion can prevent CuNP-induced oxidative liver damage. This substance should be useful as a new pharmacological tool for oxidative stress prevention.
