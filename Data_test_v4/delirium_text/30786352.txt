Methods: One hundred and twenty cases of AD patients were divided into three groups: Spouse Care Group, Adult Child Care Group and Nursing Home Group. Medical history collection and scale evaluation were carried out by trained specialists on 3 groups of patients and caregivers. Assessment included socio-demographic data, including name, gender, age, course of the disease, the year of education and the way of care, Mini mental state examination (MMSE), Activity of Daily Living (ADL), Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive section (ADAS-Cog), Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), and the Relevant Outcome Scale for Alzheimer's disease (ROSA). All the evaluations were completed upon enrollment. The differences in cognitive function, daily living ability and neuropsychiatric symptoms were compared among the three groups. Results: There was no significant difference in age, gender, education duration and course of disease between the three groups (P>0.05). The MMSE average scores of Spouse Care Group, Adult Child Care Group and Nursing Home Group were 19+-7, 15+-6, 13+-7 respectively. The ADAS-Cog median scores of Spouse Care Group, Adult Child Care Group and Nursing Home Group were 17.32(9.78, 26.50), 30.00(16.10, 38.55), 33.15 (16.28, 50.68). The NPI median total scores of Spouse Care Group, Adult Child Care Group and Nursing Home Group were 5.00(1.00, 13.00), 9.00(4.00, 20.00), 19.50(8.50, 28.50) respectively. The ADL average scores of Spouse Care Group, Adult Child Care Group and Nursing Home Group were 21+-9, 25+-9, 35+-11. The difference of MMSE, ADAS-Cog, ADL and NPI was statistically significant among the three groups (P<0.05). No significant difference was found in care burden among the three groups (P>0.05). Conclusions: The AD patients with spouse care tend to suffer from mild diseases severitys, no matter in terms of cognitive function, daily living ability or neuropsychiatric symptoms. Close, familiar and comprehensive care plays an important role in delaying the progress of AD.
