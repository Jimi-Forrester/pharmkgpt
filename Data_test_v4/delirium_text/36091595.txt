36091595|t|Transcriptomic Profiling of Electroacupuncture Regulating the Molecular Network in Hippocampus of Rats with Cerebral Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury.
36091595|a|Objective: To explore the mechanism of electroacupuncture stimulation of the hand-taiyin meridian in regulating the molecular network of rats with cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury based on transcriptomics. Methods: Male SD rats were randomly divided into sham operation group, model group, and electroacupuncture (EA) group. Middle cerebral artery embolization/reperfusion injury (MCAO/R) was used to establish the model group and EA group. The sham operation group only performed sham operation without modeling and any intervention, and the model group was bound daily. The EA group received electroacupuncture to stimulate the acupoints of hand-taiyin meridian for 14 days. Then, neurological scores, pathomorphological observations, and Tunel staining were performed. Finally, the affected hippocampus of the rat was used for transcriptome sequencing and RT-PCR detection. Results: After electroacupuncture intervention in rats, neurological function scores were improved, and neuronal apoptosis was reduced. The results of transcriptomics showed that a total of 1097 differentially expressed genes were obtained, of which 422 were upregulated and 675 were downregulated. The bioinformatics analysis showed that those differentially expressed genes were related to axon development, neuron projection development, neuron projection morphogenesis, plasma membrane cell projection morphogenesis, cell part morphogenesis, notch signaling pathway, long-term potentiation, MAPK signaling pathway, Hedgehog signaling pathway, and so on. The results of RT-PCR showed that Caspase 9 mRNA increased and BDNF, Grin2a, and PlexinD1 mRNA decreased after electroacupuncture intervention (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Electroacupuncture intervention on hand-taiyin meridian may reduce neurological function scores, inhibit neuron apoptosis, and enhance neuronal repair neuroreparation in MCAO/R rats, which may be related to the regulation of genes such as Caspase 9, BDNF, Grin2a, and PlexinD1.
