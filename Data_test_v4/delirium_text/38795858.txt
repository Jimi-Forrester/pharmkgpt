38795858|a|Glycosphingolipids (GSLs) are abundant glycolipids on cells and essential for cell recognition, adhesion, signal transduction, and so on. However, their lipid anchors are not long enough to cross the membrane bilayer. To transduce transmembrane signals, GSLs must interact with other membrane components, whereas such interactions are difficult to investigate. To overcome this difficulty, bifunctional derivatives of II3-beta-N-acetyl-D-galactosamine-GA2 (GalNAc-GA2) and beta-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine-ceramide (GlcNAc-Cer) were synthesized as probes to explore GSL-interacting membrane proteins in live cells. Both probes contain photoreactive diazirine in the lipid moiety, which can crosslink with proximal membrane proteins upon photoactivation, and clickable alkyne in the glycan to facilitate affinity tag addition for crosslinked protein pull-down and characterization. The synthesis is highlighted by the efficient assembly of simple glycolipid precursors followed by on-site lipid remodeling. These probes were employed to profile GSL-interacting membrane proteins in HEK293 cells. The GalNAc-GA2 probe revealed 312 distinct proteins, with GlcNAc-Cer probe-crosslinked proteins as controls, suggesting the potential influence of the glycan on GSL functions. Many of the proteins identified with the GalNAc-GA2 probe are associated with GSLs, and some have been validated as being specific to this probe. The versatile probe design and experimental protocols are anticipated to be widely applicable to GSL research.
