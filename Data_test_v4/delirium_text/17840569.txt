17840569|a|Although the b-amyloid vaccine now being explored as a potential Alzheimer's therapy attracted the bulk of the attention at the World Alzheimer Congress 2000 (see previous story), another, more conventional, drug is showing promise in clinical trials. A neuropsychiatrist reported at the "hot topics" session of the congress that the drug memantine, which has been used in Germany for 10 years to treat dementias, significantly slowed the progression of Alzheimer's symptoms in patients with moderately severe disease.
