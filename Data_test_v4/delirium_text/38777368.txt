38777368|t|Spectrum-effect relationship between HPLC fingerprints and antioxidant activity of Qi-Fu-Yin based on multiple statistical correlation analysis.
38777368|a|INTRODUCTION: Qi-Fu-Yin has been used to treat Alzheimer's disease (AD) in China. Oxidative stress has been recognized as a factor in AD progress. To date, there is no quality control method to ensure batch-to-batch consistency of Qi-Fu-Yin, and the potential antioxidant compounds in Qi-Fu-Yin remain uncertain. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to identify the potential antioxidant compounds of Qi-Fu-Yin and establish quality control standards for Qi-Fu-Yin. METHODS: High-performance liquid chromatography was used to establish and quantify the fingerprints of Qi-Fu-Yin from various batches. Ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Q-TOF/MS) was used to identify the common peaks. Bivariate correlation analysis, partial least squares regression analysis, and gray correlation analysis were used to establish the spectrum-effect relationship. RESULTS: Forty-nine common peaks were determined through the establishment of fingerprints. Among them, 35 common peaks were preliminarily characterized. The multiple statistical correlation analysis methods identified six compounds as potential antioxidant constituents of Qi-Fu-Yin, and their antioxidant activities were validated in vitro. All six antioxidant compounds derived from two herbs. Therefore, three chemical index compounds derived from other three herbs were added to the quantitative analysis, while for two herbs, no peaks could be included. Eventually, six antioxidant constituents and three index compounds were quantitatively determined to provide a relatively comprehensive quality control for Qi-Fu-Yin. CONCLUSIONS: The study elucidated the antioxidant substance basis of Qi-Fu-Yin and provided a relatively comprehensive approach for the assay of Qi-Fu-Yin, which is a promising advance in the quality control of Qi-Fu-Yin.
