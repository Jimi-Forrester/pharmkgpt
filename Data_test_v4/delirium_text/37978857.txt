37978857|a|Patients and families in critical care have a high likelihood of previous and re-experienced trauma. Unaddressed, physical, and psychological impacts of these traumas can worsen outcomes for patients and families. A trauma-informed care approach has been proposed for critical care; however, training programs do not include relational competencies or de-escalation techniques, risking the re-traumatization of patients and families in critical care and negatively impacting clinicians. This article describes a strategy that can be adopted by critical care teams towards the creation of a trauma-informed critical care unit including the use of a framework for relational training. Principles of relationship management and de-escalation are discussed with the use of a fictional exemplar scenario. Key messages include a call to action for relational training for care teams to enhance skilled relational engagement of patients and families. This article also highlights the foundational importance of policies supporting a trauma-informed approach in critical care.
