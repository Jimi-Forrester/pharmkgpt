It is observed that there is an excessive accumulation of amyloid beta (Abeta) in the extracellular space of the brain. AD is the first neurodegenerative disease in the elderly, and so far there is no effective treatment. In recent years, many studies have reported that Alzheimer's disease has a relationship with gut microflora, indicating that regulating gut microbiota could offer therapeutic intervention for AD. This study explored the effect Bifidobacteria has in averting AD. METHODS: WT and APP/PS1 mice were used for the experiments. The mice were randomly assigned to four groups: WT group, WT + Bi group, AD group (APP/PS1 mouse) and AD + Bi group (Bifidobacteria-treated APP/PS1 mouse). Treatment with Bifidobacteria lasted for 6 months and mice were prepared for immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, Thioflavin S staining, Western blotting, PCR and Elisa quantitative assay. RESULTS: The results show that after 6 months of treatment with Bifidobacteria signiis to be lesficantly reduces Abeta deposition in cortex and hippocampus of AD mice. The level of insoluble Abeta in the hippocampus and cortex of AD+Bi mice was decreased compared with AD mice. Meanwhile, a significant decrease in the level of soluble Abeta in the cortex of AD+Bi mice but not in the hippocampus was observed. The activation of microglia and the release of inflammatory factors were also determined in this study. From the results, Bifidobacteria inhibited microglial activation and reduced IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, IL-4, IL-6 and INF-gamma release. Altogether, these results implied that Bifidobacteria can alleviate the pathological changes of AD through various effects.
