37326113|t|Estrogens as a Possible Therapeutic Strategy for the Management of Neuroinflammation and Neuroprotection in COVID-19.
37326113|a|The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) affects several tissues, including the central and peripheral nervous system. It has also been related to signs and symptoms that suggest neuroinflam- mation with possible effects in the short, medium, and long term. Estrogens could have a positive im- pact on the management of the disease, not only due to its already known immunomodulator effect, but also activating other pathways that may be important in the pathophysiology of COVID-19, such as the regulation of the virus receptor and its metabolites. In addition, they can have a positive effect on neuroinflammation secondary to pathologies other than COVID-19. The aim of this study is to an- alyze the molecular mechanisms that link estrogens with their possible therapeutic effect for neuroin- flammation related to COVID-19. Advanced searches were performed in scientific databases as Pub- Med, ProQuest, EBSCO, the Science Citation index, and clinical trials. Estrogens have been shown to participate in the immune modulation of the response to severe acute respiratory syndrome corona- virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In addition to this mechanism, we propose that estrogens can regulate the ex- pression and activity of the Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), reestablishing its cytoprotec- tive function, which may be limited by its interaction with SARS-CoV-2. In this proposal, estrogens and estrogenic compounds could increase the synthesis of Angiotensin-(1-7) (Ang-(1-7)) that acts through the Mas receptor (MasR) in cells that are being attacked by the virus. Estrogens can be a promising, accessible, and low-cost treatment for neuroprotection and neuroinflammation in patients with COVID-19, due to its direct immunomodulatory capacity in decreasing cytokine storm and in creasing cytoprotective capacity of the axis ACE2/Ang (1-7)/MasR.
