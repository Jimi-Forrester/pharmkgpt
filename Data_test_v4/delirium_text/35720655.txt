35720655|t|Effect of providing purple sweet potato water extract on tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels, protein 53 expression, glial fibrillary acidic protein expression, brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels, and spatial working memory in rats with d-galactose induction.
35720655|a|Alzheimer's dementia (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease. The mechanism of oxidative stress in AD is due to amyloid beta (Abeta) protein that aggregates to form plaques, which further triggers chronic inflammation and neuronal apoptosis. Purple sweet potato extract with the main content of anthocyanins is a potential antioxidant with a direct target on the amyloid cascade hypothesis. Objective: The research objective was to determine the role of purple sweet potato water extract as an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory in preventing apoptosis in order to provide a neuroprotective effect in d-galactose-induced rats. Methods: A total of 100 male Wistar rats with randomized posttest-only control group design that met the eligibility criteria were included in this study. The treatment group was given 200 mg/kg BW/day of purple sweet potato water extract on days 1-70. d-galactose induction was administered in the treatment and control groups on days 15-70. Results: The independent t-test showed that the mean tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) levels in the treatment group (735.36+-139.74) was significantly lower than that in the control group (896.77+-152.52). The p53 and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expressions of astrocyte cells in the treatment group were significantly lower than that in the control group. The brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels in the treatment group (498.13+-121.47) were higher than that in the control (391.93+-140.28), and there was a significant increase in spatial working memory in the treatment group (72.01+-10.22) than the control (59.77+-11.87). Conclusions: The neuroprotective effect of purple sweet potato extract is due to d-galactose induction resulting from decrease in TNF-alpha levels, p53 expression, and GFAP expression and increase in BDNF levels and spatial working memory.
