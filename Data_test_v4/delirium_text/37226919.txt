37226919|t|Recognizing and Reducing Delirium in the Intensive Care Unit.
37226919|a|This article discusses a quality improvement study conducted on intensive care unit (ICU) staff nurses that assessed their ability to utilize the CAM-ICU tool for delirium detection properly. Staff members' expertise in identifying and managing delirious patients directly correlates with reducing the long-term sequelae associated with ICU delirium. The cohort of ICU nurses participating in this research study took a questionnaire on 4 separate occasions. The survey ascertained quantitative and qualitative data, reflecting personal knowledge about the CAM-ICU tool and delirium. After each round of assessment, group and one-on-one educational sessions were provided by the researchers. The study culminated with providing each staff member a delirium reference card (badge buddy) containing relevant and easily accessible clinical information that supported the ICU staff nurses in correctly implementing the CAM-ICU tool.
