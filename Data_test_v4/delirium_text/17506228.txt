17506228|a|This paper reviews findings regarding short- and long-term neuropsychiatric consequences of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and noncardiac surgery. Stroke is one of the potentially most serious complications of CABG; studies have identified some demographic and medical risk factors. Short-term neuropsychological deficits are common after CABG, but have been similarly documented in noncardiac surgery patients, and may therefore not be specific to this procedure. Neuropsychological deficits in some cognitive areas may persist over time. Patients with depression before surgery are likely to have persistent depression afterwards. Also, depression does not account for the cognitive decline after CABG. Conflicting findings, and the possible methodological limitations of current published studies, are presented and discussed.
