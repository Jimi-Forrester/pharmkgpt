517691|t|Munchausen's syndrome: an unusual case.
517691|a|Unlike most Munchausen patients, Miss A. was willing to define herself as a psychiatric, as well as a medical-surgical patient. Consequently, it was possible to engage her in therapy in which observation could occur. It was found, also, that Miss A. had used eye drops to dilate her pupils to simulate a neurological disorder and had accidentally induced an anticholinergic delirium.
