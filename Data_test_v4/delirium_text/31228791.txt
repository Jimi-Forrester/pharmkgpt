31228791|a|Functional connectivity pattern altered of default mode network (DMN) is gaining more attention as a potential noninvasive biomarker to diagnose incipient Alzheimer's disease. However, the changed functional connectivity except for DMN, the longitudinal changes in executive control network (ECN) and frontoparietal network (FPN) also has attracted wide interest. Moreover, AD-related functional connectivity abnormalities within the DMN are well replicated research, but the (increased/decreased and reduced) functional connectivity in ECN and FPN weren't receive adequate attention. To address the above issues, in this paper, we adopt sparse inverse covariance estimation (SICE) approach to investigate the changed functional connectivity of ECN and FPN on the ADNI2 dataset. Our experimental results indicate the left superior frontal gyrus (SFGmed.L) and left thalamus (THA.L) regions of ECN has shown increased functional connectivity, the left anterior cingulate (ACG.L) region of ECN has shown decreased functional connectivity. The Superior Parietal Gyrus (SPG) regions and left paracentral lobule (PCL.L) of FPN has shown increased functional connectivity, the left supramarginal gyrus (SMG.L) regions has shown decreased functional connectivity in AD patients. On the other hand, the ACG.L regions in ECN, SMG.L and left inferior parietal (IPL.L) in FPN have shown significantly reduced functional connectivity. These results demonstrate that increased/decreased functional connectivity and reduced functional connectivity not only within DMN, but also associated with ECN and FPN. It also suggest that AD is associated with the characteristics of large-scale functional networks, and these changed functional connectivity possibly as a potential noninvasive biomarker to diagnose incipient Alzheimer's disease.
