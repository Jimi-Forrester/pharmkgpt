35763443|t|Semiquantitative 3T Brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging for Dynamic Visualization of the Glymphatic-Lymphatic Fluid Transport System in Humans: A Pilot Study.
35763443|a|OBJECTIVES: Recently, a novel clearing system for interstitial solutes of the brain was described as a perivascular pathway named the glymphatic system. Furthermore, lymphatic vessels were found in the meninges to drain interstitial fluids. It is hypothesized that interstitial solutes, such as amyloid beta, are firstly processed through the brain by the glymphatic system and secondly drained out of the brain by lymphatic vessels (glymphatic-lymphatic fluid transport system [GLS]). Since then, various neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer disease, have been associated with a dysfunction of the GLS. In the current study, we aimed to establish a clinical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study protocol for visualizing lymphatic vessels as part of the GLS in humans. More importantly, we aimed to describe the dynamic changes of a contrast agent in these lymphatic vessels over time. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty volunteers with an unremarkable neurological/psychiatric history were included in this 3T MRI study. Serial MRI sequence blocks were performed at 3 predefined time points (TPs): TP 1, precontrast MRI before administration of a gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA); TP 2, immediately post-GBCA (early ce-MRI); and TP 3, 60 minutes post-GBCA (late ce-MRI). Each MRI block contained the following sequences obtained in the same order: whole-brain 3D T1-MPRAGE, whole-brain 3D T2-FLAIR, focused 2D T2-FLAIR, and whole-brain 3D T1-SPACE. Signal intensity (SI) in compartments of the GLS adjacent to the superior sagittal sinus, gray matter (GM), white matter (WM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was calculated by manually placed regions of interest. The time course of the signal intensities was examined by generalized linear mixed models. The data were adjusted for age, cognitive function (Montreal-Cognitive-Assessment test), and sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index questionnaire). RESULTS: The GLS was best visualized in the 2D T2-FLAIR and 3D T1-SPACE sequences, enabling further SI measurement. In precontrast (TP 1), the SI within the GLS was significantly higher than in CSF and significantly lower than in GM and WM. In post-GBCA, a significant increase (TP 2) and decrease (TP 3), respectively, of the GLS SI values were noted (86.3 +- 25.2% increase and subsequent decrease by 25.4 +- 9% in the 3D T1-SPACE sequence). The SI values of CSF, GM, and WM did not change significantly between the 3 TPs. CONCLUSIONS: A clinical MRI study protocol was established for the visualization of lymphatic vessels as an important part of the GLS and therefore the brain's clearing mechanism of interstitial solutes. Furthermore, dynamic changes in the GLS were described over time, possibly reflecting the clearing function of the GLS. This might constitute the basis for evaluating the GLS function in manifold neurological pathologies in the future.
