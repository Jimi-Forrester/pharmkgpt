29636643|t|Functional role of microRNA-135a in colitis.
29636643|a|BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is one of the chronic gastrointestinal diseases with increasing risk of colon cancer development in the future. Apoptosis and inflammation play an important role in the etiology of this disease. MicroRNAs are associated with etiology of different diseases including IBD. In this study, we aimed to explore the role of miR-135a in the etiology of colitis in murine model of DSS-induced colitis. RESULTS: The results showed that expression of miR-135a in colonic cells was suppressed and up-regulating miR-135a inhibited apoptosis and inflammation of colonic epithelial cells. Additionally, Hif1alpha was identified as the target gene of miR-135a which promoted apoptosis and inflammation as knockdown of Hif1alpha led to the suppression of both apoptosis and inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: Overexpression of miR-135a might be beneficial in IBD due to its anti-apoptosis and anti-inflammation effects in vitro.
