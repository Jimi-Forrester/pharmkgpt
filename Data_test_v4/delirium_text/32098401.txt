32098401|t|Micro RNA Molecules as Modulators of Treatment Resistance, Immune Checkpoints Controllers and Sensitive Biomarkers in Glioblastoma Multiforme.
32098401|a|Based on genome sequencing, it is estimated that over 90% of genes stored in human genetic material are transcribed, but only 3% of them contain the information needed for the production of body proteins. This group also includes micro RNAs representing about 1%-3% of the human genome. Recent studies confirmed the hypothesis that targeting molecules called Immune Checkpoint (IC) open new opportunities to take control over glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Detection of markers that indicate the presence of the cancer occupies a very important place in modern oncology. This function can be performed by both the cancer cells themselves as well as their components and other substances detected in the patients' bodies. Efforts have been made for many years to find a suitable marker useful in the diagnosis and monitoring of gliomas, including glioblastoma.
