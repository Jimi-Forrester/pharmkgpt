24403973|t|Surgery of the ear and the lateral skull base: pitfalls and complications.
24403973|a|Surgery of the ear and the lateral skull base is a fascinating, yet challenging field in otorhinolaryngology. A thorough knowledge of the associated complications and pitfalls is indispensable for the surgeon, not only to provide the best possible care to his patients, but also to further improve his surgical skills. Following a summary about general aspects in pre-, intra-and postoperative care of patients with disorders of the ear/lateral skull base, this article covers the most common pitfalls and complications in stapes surgery, cochlear implantation and surgery of vestibular schwannomas and jugulotympanal paragangliomas. Based on these exemplary procedures, basic "dos and don'ts" of skull base surgery are explained, which the reader can easily transfer to other disorders. Special emphasis is laid on functional aspects, such as hearing, balance and facial nerve function. Furthermore, the topics of infection, bleeding, skull base defects, quality of life and indication for revision surgery are discussed. An open communication about complications and pitfalls in ear/lateral skull base surgery among surgeons is a prerequisite for the further advancement of this fascinating field in ENT surgery. This article is meant to be a contribution to this process.
