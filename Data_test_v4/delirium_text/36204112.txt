36204112|t|Regulation and bioinformatic analysis of circ_0015891/miR-129-1-3p axis in methamphetamine-induced dopaminergic apoptosis.
36204112|a|Methamphetamine (METH) abuse can result in severe neurotoxicity, for which the mechanism is not yet clear. In the present study, we investigated the role of noncoding RNAs in METH-induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity, and analyzed the underlying mechanism using bioinformatic methods. We confirmed by flow cytometry that miR-129-1-3p is involved in promoting dopaminergic apoptosis under METH treatment and its role could be inhibited by a high concentration of circ_0015891. Also, we combined transcriptomic data with bioinformatics to explore the downstream mechanism of miR-129-1-3p regulation of METH-induced apoptosis, highlighted the potentially pivotal figure of response to nutrition. Further bioinformatic analysis of circ_0015891 was conducted as well and showed that circ_0015891 was the sponge of various microRNAs that effect apoptosis by different mechanisms. Collectively, we found a novel circ_0015891/miR-129-1-3p axis that may be a promising therapeutic target for METH-induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity.
