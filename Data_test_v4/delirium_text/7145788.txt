7145788|t|Agitation in the elderly: an often-treatable manifestation of acute brain syndrome.
7145788|a|Agitation in elderly patients is often caused by acute cerebral failure, more commonly called acute brain syndrome, delirium, or acute confusional state. Defects in cognition, sleep-waking cycles, and psychomotor behavior result. Careful history taking, physical examination, and laboratory testing may reveal a specific, reversible organic factor related to the acute brain syndrome. This article outlines the clues to recognizing agitation due to a cerebral failure and gives guidelines for workup and management.
