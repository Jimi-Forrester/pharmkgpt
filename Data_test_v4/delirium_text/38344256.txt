38344256|t|The Effect of Ciprofol on Postoperative Delirium in Elderly Patients Undergoing Thoracoscopic Surgery for Lung Cancer: A Prospective, Randomized, Controlled Trial.
38344256|a|Purpose: This study was conducted to assess whether ciprofol vs propofol could affect the incidence of postoperative delirium (POD) in elderly patients with lung cancer after thoracoscopic surgery. Patients and Methods: In this study, a total of 84 elderly patients undergoing thoracoscopic surgery for lung cancer were recruited and randomized into two groups to receive anesthesia with either ciprofol or propofol. The primary outcome was the incidence of POD within three days after surgery. Secondary outcomes included the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) score, intraoperative indicators related to mean arterial pressure (MAP), and cerebral tissue oxygen saturation (SctO2). Moreover, MAP- and SctO2-related indicators associated with POD were analyzed. Results: The incidence of POD was 7.1% and 16.7%, respectively, in the ciprofol group and the propofol group (risk ratio [RR], 0.37; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.07 to 2.03; risk difference [RD], -9.6%; 95% CI, -23.3% to 4.1%; p = 0.178). Compared with those in the propofol group, patients in the ciprofol group had lower CAM scores three days after surgery (13 (12, 15) vs 15 (14, 17); 12 (11, 13) vs 14 (13, 16); 12 (11, 12) vs 13 (12, 14), p<0.05). Besides, patients in the ciprofol group exhibited higher mean and minimum MAP (88.63 +- 6.7 vs 85 +- 8.3; 69.81 +- 9.59 vs 64.9 +- 9.43, p<0.05) and SctO2 (77.26 +- 3.96 vs 75.3 +- 4.49, 71.69 +- 4.51 vs 68.77 +- 6.46, p<0.05) and percentage of time for blood pressure stabilization (0.6 +- 0.14 vs 0.45 +- 0.14, p<0.05) than those in the propofol group. Furthermore, MAP and SctO2-related indicators were validated to correlate with POD. Conclusion: Anesthesia with ciprofol did not increase the incidence of POD compared with propofol. The results demonstrated that ciprofol could improve intraoperative MAP and SctO2 levels and diminish postoperative CAM scores.
