38361677|a|OBJECTIVE: Many reports on inpatient dysphagia rehabilitation in acute and convalescent rehabilitation hospitals exist, but there are a few reports on outpatient treatments. Otolaryngologists still take a trial-and-error approach when treating dysphagia. Here, we explore the effectiveness and limitations of outpatient treatment in ear-nose-and-throat (ENT) clinics. METHODS: Sixty-four patients (41 males and 23 females) aged 27-101 years (mean 78 years) visited an outpatient clinic specialising in feeding and swallowing conditions (the Fukuyo ENT Clinic). All were able to perform the activities of daily living (ADL) to the extent that outpatient visits were possible; no home visits were made. The weekly outpatient day was staffed by an otolaryngologist and a speech-language-hearing therapist (SLHT). All patients were subjected to fibreoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES), followed by appropriate training as revealed by the examinations. RESULTS: Salivary retention in the glottis valley and piriform sinuses improved (both p < 0.05) in 30 patients who underwent repeat FEES; we compared the initial and final figures. In 14 cases in whom maximal tongue pressure (TP) was measured, this was higher at the final than at the first examination (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Outpatient treatment at ENT clinics for patients who are able to maintain their ADLs to the extent that they are able to walk to a hospital is an option for the treatment of age-related dysphagia. For severe cases, however, house calls and collaboration with the home and nursing care sector will be necessary and should be considered in the future.
