37142459|a|OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of geriatric syndromes (GS) in the geriatric population of the different intermediate care resources, as well as its relationship with intrahospital mortality. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A prospective observational descriptive study, carried out in intermediate care resources in the Vic area (Barcelona) between July 2018 and September 2019. All people aged >=65 years and/or criteria of complex chronic patient and/or advanced chronic disease, who were assessed for the presence of GS using the trigger questions of the Frail VIG-Index (IF-VIG), administered at baseline, on admission, on discharge and 30 days after discharge. RESULTS: Four hundred and forty-two participants were included, of which 55.4% were women, with a mean age of 83.48 years. There are significant differences (P<.05) between frailty, age and number of GS in relation to the intermediate care resource at the time of admission. There were significant differences in the prevalence of GS between the group of patients who died during the hospitalization (24.7% of the sample) in relation to the survivors: both in a situation baseline (malnutrition, dysphagia, delirium, loss of autonomy, pressure ulcers, and insomnia), as well as in the admission assessment (falls, malnutrition, dysphagia, cognitive impairment, delirium, loss of autonomy, and insomnia). CONCLUSIONS: There is a close relationship between the prevalence of GS and in-hospital mortality in intermediate care resources. In the absence of more studies, the use of the IF-VIG as a screening checklist for GS could be useful for its detection.
