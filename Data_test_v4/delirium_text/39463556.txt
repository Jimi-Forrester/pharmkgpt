39463556|t|The Nexus of Aging and Substance Use: A Scoping Review of Therapeutic Modalities for Geriatric Substance Use Disorders.
39463556|a|The insidious grip of substance use disorders (SUDs) manifests as a ubiquitous public health crisis, indiscriminately affecting individuals across the spectrum of age, gender, and socioeconomic status. While advancements in treatment offer a glimmer of hope, millions continue to grapple with the debilitating physical, psychological, and social consequences of addiction, particularly those involving alcohol and opioids. This crisis is further exacerbated by the alarming rise of SUDs among older adults. As the global population undergoes a process of demographic senescence, the escalating prevalence of SUDs in this demographic underscores the urgent need for nuanced interventions. This review explores the therapeutic landscape for managing SUDs in older adults, evaluating pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment modalities. A detailed literature search was conducted using databases like PubMed, Google Scholar, and Scopus, and studies were selected based on their relevance to therapeutic interventions for older adults with SUDs, encompassing pharmacological and non-pharmacological modalities. The synthesized results provide an extensive overview of contemporary therapeutic approaches. The findings indicate that pharmacological interventions demonstrate varied effectiveness in managing opioid and alcohol use disorders, with each drug offering distinct benefits and limitations regarding safety, tolerability, and patient adherence. Non-pharmacological interventions provide critical psychological and social support, often requiring adaptations to meet elderly patients' needs effectively. Integrated care models, which combine pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments, emerge as the most effective approach, addressing the comprehensive needs of elderly patients by leveraging multidisciplinary teams, centralized service access, and coordinated, patient-centered care. Implementing these models, however, requires overcoming significant resource and coordination challenges. Indeed, the confluence of a burgeoning geriatric population and escalating rates of SUDs necessitates the development and implementation of granular and integrated care protocols specifically designed for older adults. By employing such a targeted approach, optimism can be cultivated and the quality of life enhanced for this vulnerable and often overlooked segment of society. This ensures the fight against addiction extends its reach, leaving no one behind.
