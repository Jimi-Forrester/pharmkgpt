33716147|t|Atopic dermatitis and dementia risk: A nationwide longitudinal study.
33716147|a|BACKGROUND: Retrospective studies have suggested that patients with dementia have higher prevalence of atopic dermatitis (AD) than those without dementia. However, the temporal association of AD with subsequent dementia remains unknown. OBJECTIVE: To assess the temporal association of AD with subsequent dementia. METHODS: We included data of patients with AD aged 45 years and older (n = 1059) and 1:10 age, sex, residence, income, and dementia-related comorbidity-matched controls (n = 10,590) from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database and reviewed their subsequent dementia development from the enrollment date to the end of 2013. RESULTS: After adjustments for dementia-related comorbidities, patients with AD were found to be more likely to develop any dementia (hazard ratio [HR], 2.02; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.24-3.29), particularly Alzheimer's disease (HR, 3.74; 95% CI, 1.17-11.97), during the follow-up period than those in the control group. Moderate-to-severe AD was associated with a high subsequent dementia risk (HR, 4.64; 95% CI, 2.58-8.33). Sensitivity analyses with the exclusion of the first 3 (HR, 2.20; 95% CI, 1.28-3.80) or 5 (HR, 2.05; 95% CI, 1.08-3.89) years of observation revealed consistent findings. CONCLUSION: AD may be an independent risk factor for new-onset dementia. Clinicians may monitor the trajectory of neurocognitive function among elderly patients with AD. Additional studies elucidating the pathomechanisms between AD and subsequent dementia are warranted.
