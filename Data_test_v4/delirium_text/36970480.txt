36970480|t|Recent advances in critical care: Part II.
36970480|a|With the increasing number of critically ill patients being admitted to intensive care units (ICUs), newer techniques and treatment modalities continue to evolve for their adequate management. Thus, it has become imperative to understand existing tools and resources, and utilise or repurpose them to achieve better results that can decrease morbidity and mortality. In this writeup, we chose five areas of interest, including analgosedation, role of colloids, recent advancements in the management of respiratory failure, the role of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and newer antimicrobials. The role of analgosedation in the critically ill has gained importance with focus on post-ICU syndromes, and albumin has re-entered the fray as a possible repairer of the injured glycocalyx. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic forced us to relook at various ventilator strategies and mechanical support for the failing circulation has now become more common with clear end-points. Rising microbial antibiotic resistance has opened up the research on newer antibiotics.
