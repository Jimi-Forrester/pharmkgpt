38879906|a|PURPOSE: Sarcopenia or age-associated muscle loss is common in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). We have previously demonstrated the contribution of a leaky gut to sarcopenia in AD. Here, we asked whether resistant exercise (RE) reduces the sarcopenia phenotype by repairing intestinal leakage in patients with AD. METHOD: A prospective, single-center study of older adults, including healthy controls and patients with AD (n = 44-51/group), was conducted to measure plasma zonulin and claudin-3 (markers of intestinal leakage), handgrip strength (HGS), and short physical performance battery (SPPB) as a measure of functional capacity. Measurements in patients with AD were performed at baseline and after 12 weeks of RE. RESULTS: At baseline, patients with AD had higher plasma zonulin and claudin-3 and lower HGS, gait speed, and SPPB scores than controls. RE reduced plasma zonulin and claudin-3 levels and improved HGS, SPPB scores, and gait speed. Regression analysis revealed robust relationships between changes in plasma zonulin and claudin-3 with HGS. Plasma zonulin was also positively associated with SPPB scores. In addition, RE downregulated plasma markers of inflammation and oxidative stress. However, the prevalence of sarcopenia based on low HGS and muscle atrophy or low SPPB was not affected by RE. CONCLUSION: Taken together, disruption of the intestinal mucosal barrier may contribute to functional decline and sarcopenia in AD, which is incompletely recovered by RE. Circulating levels of zonulin and claudin-3 may be valuable in predicting sarcopenia and functional capacity in older adults with AD.
