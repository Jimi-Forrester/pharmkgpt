26971524|a|Progressive accumulation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) will form the senile plaques and cause oxidative damage and neuronal cell death, which was accepted as the major pathological mechanism to the Alzheimer's disease (AD). Hence, inhibition of Abeta-induced oxidative damage and neuronal cell apoptosis by agents with potential antioxidant properties represents one of the most effective strategies in combating human AD. Curcumin (Cur) a natural extraction from curcuma longa has potential of pharmacological efficacy, including the benefit to antagonize Abeta-induced neurotoxicity. However, the molecular mechanism remains elusive. The present study evaluated the protective effect of Cur against Abeta-induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis in PC12 cells and investigated the underlying mechanism. The results showed that Cur markedly reduced Abeta-induced cytotoxicity by inhibition of mitochondria-mediated apoptosis through regulation of Bcl-2 family. The PARP cleavage, caspases activation, and ROS-mediated DNA damage induced by Abeta were all significantly blocked by Cur. Moreover, regulation of p38 MAPK and AKT pathways both contributed to this protective potency. Our findings suggested that Cur could effectively suppress Abeta-induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis by inhibition of ROS-mediated oxidative damage and regulation of ERK pathway, which validated its therapeutic potential in chemoprevention and chemotherapy of Abeta-induced neurotoxicity.
