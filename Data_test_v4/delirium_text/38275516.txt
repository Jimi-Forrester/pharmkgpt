38275516|a|There are approximately 24 million cases of Alzheimer's disease (AD) worldwide, and the number of cases is expected to increase four-fold by 2050. AD is a neurodegenerative disease that leads to severe dementia in most patients. There are several neuropathological signs of AD, such as deposition of amyloid beta (Abeta) plaques, formation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), neuronal loss, activation of inflammasomes, and declining autophagy. Several of these hallmarks are linked to the gut microbiome. The gastrointestinal (GI) tract contains microbial diversity, which is important in regulating several functions in the brain via the gut-brain axis (GBA). The disruption of the balance in the gut microbiota is known as gut dysbiosis. Recent studies strongly support that targeting gut dysbiosis with selective bioflavonoids is a highly plausible solution to attenuate activation of inflammasomes (contributing to neuroinflammation) and resume autophagy (a cellular mechanism for lysosomal degradation of the damaged components and recycling of building blocks) to stop AD pathogenesis. This review is focused on two bioflavonoids, specifically epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) and genistein (GS), as a possible new paradigm of treatment for maintaining healthy gut microbiota in AD due to their implications in modulating crucial AD signaling pathways. The combination of EGCG and GS has a higher potential than either agent alone to attenuate the signaling pathways implicated in AD pathogenesis. The effects of EGCG and GS on altering gut microbiota and GBA were also explored, along with conclusions from various delivery methods to increase the bioavailability of these bioflavonoids in the body.
