27698701|t|Alien hand syndrome following corpus callosum infarction: A case report and review of the literature.
27698701|a|Alien hand syndrome (AHS) is characterized by involuntary and autonomous activity of the affected limbs, and consists of the frontal, callosal and posterior AHS variants. The callosal subtype, resulting from damage to the corpus callosum, frequently features intermanual conflict. However, infarction of the corpus callosum is rare due to abundant blood supply. The present study reported a case of AHS (callosal subtype, in the right hand) caused by callosal infarction. Infarction of the left corpus callosum was confirmed with magnetic resonance imaging. In addition, magnetic resonance angiography and digital subtraction angiography examinations revealed multiple lesions in the feeding arteries. Subsequent to antiplatelet therapy for 2 weeks following admission, the patient gradually recovered. Furthermore, the current study reviewed 31 previously reported cases of AHS following callosal infarction in the literature.
