24011543|a|Low cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Abeta(42) levels correlate with increased brain Abeta deposition in Alzheimer's disease (AD), which suggests a disruption in the degradation and clearance of Abeta from the brain. In addition, APOE epsilon4 carriers have lower CSF Abeta(42) levels than non-carriers. The hypothesis of this investigation was that CSF Abeta(42) levels would correlate with regulatory region variation in genes that are biologically associated with degradation or clearance of Abeta from the brain. CSF Abeta(42) levels were tested for associations with Abeta degradation and clearance genes and APOE epsilon4. Twenty-four SNPs located within the 5' and 3' regions of 12 genes were analyzed. The study sample consisted of 99 AD patients and 168 cognitively normal control subjects. CSF Abeta(42) levels were associated with APOE epsilon4 status in controls but not in AD patients; A2M regulatory region SNPs were also associated with CSF Abeta(42) levels in controls but not in AD patients, even after adjusting for APOE epsilon4. These results suggest that genetic variation within the A2M gene influences CSF Abeta(42) levels.
