37954765|t|Intranasal Dexmedetomidine With Intravenous Midazolam: A Safe and Effective Alternative in the Paediatric MRI Sedation.
37954765|a|Background and aims MRI sedation in paediatrics includes challenges like respiratory depression, maintaining haemodynamic stability and use of neuroprotective drugs, since MRI is performed in remote places outside the operating room with a lack of support staff and nonavailability of choice of medications and equipments. The primary aim was to use a combination of the drugs to encounter the above challenges and look for its efficacy. The secondary aim of the study was to determine the rate of successful completion of MRI in children using a combination of intranasal dexmedetomidine and intravenous midazolam - without the need for rescue sedatives. Methods This is an observational study involving 60 children in the age group between two months and six years undergoing an MRI. Children belonging to the American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) 1 and 2 were given intranasal dexmedetomidine 3microg/kg, time to onset of sedation was noted and injection of midazolam 0.1 mg/kg was given intravenously. MRI was started once the child was asleep. Children who woke up during the MRI were supplemented with inj. propofol 0.5-1mg/kg and were documented. Results The median time duration for MRI was 38.7 min and the onset of sedation after intranasal dexmedetomidine was 18.7 min. The scan was successfully completed with a combination of intranasal dexmedetomidine and intravenous midazolam in 86.7% and only 13.3% of the children woke up either at the start or in between the scan and required the addition of propofol. Conclusion Drugs used for sedation during MRI should not cause respiratory depression and be safe for the developing brain. The above study has shown that a combination of intranasal dexmedetomidine and intravenous midazolam is effective and safe in performing MRIs in paediatrics.
