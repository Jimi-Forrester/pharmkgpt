37101800|t|Use of Cranial Ultrasound Prior to the Start of Therapeutic Hypothermia for Newborn Encephalopathy.
37101800|a|For a precise diagnosis of infant hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE), neuroimaging is required. The nature and time of the brain injury, the imaging modalities used, and the timing of their application all affect the therapeutic usefulness of neuroimaging in neonatal HIE. Most neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) across the world have access to cranial ultrasound (cUS), a safe, low-cost piece of technology that may be used at the patient's bedside. Infants undergoing active therapeutic hypothermia (TH) must undergo a cUS to be screened for intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), according to the clinical practice guidelines. The guidelines advise brain cUS on days 4 and 10-14 of life after hypothermia therapy is finished in order to thoroughly assess the nature and severity of any brain impairment. Early cUS is meant to rule out major ICH, which is listed in the local guideline for TH as a relative exclusion factor. This study questions whether cUS should be a required screening method before the start of TH.
