34498493|t|Nitric Oxide Induces a Janus Kinase-1-Dependent Inflammatory Response in Primary Murine Astrocytes.
34498493|a|Nitric oxide (NO) is a versatile free radical that has been implicated in many biological processes (i.e., vasodilation, neurotransmission, and smooth muscle relaxation). High levels of NO, such as those produced by inducible NO synthase, are associated with innate immunity as well as tissue damage and disease pathology. Previous studies have characterized many stimuli that lead to NO production following central nervous system (CNS) infection, ischemia, and during neurodegeneration, but less is known about the effects of NO on the CNS resident astrocytes. Previously, excessive NO has been shown to impair protein folding leading to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and initiation of the unfolded protein response. Previous studies have shown that ER stress drives activation of protein kinase R-like ER kinase (PERK) and Janus kinase-1 (JAK1) leading to inflammatory gene expression. We hypothesized that NO drives inflammatory processes within astrocytes through a similar process. To test this, we examined the effects of exogenous NO on primary cultures of murine astrocytes. Our data suggest that NO promotes a pro-inflammatory response that includes interleukin-6 and several chemokines. Our data show that NO induces phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha; however, this and the inflammatory gene expression are independent of PERK. Knockdown of JAK1 using small interfering RNA reduced the expression of inflammatory mediators. Overall, we have identified that NO stimulates the integrated stress response and a JAK1-dependent inflammatory program in astrocytes.Summary statement: Murine astrocytes in culture respond to NO with increased expression of stress and inflammatory genes. The inflammatory stress response is independent of the ER stress-activated kinase PERK and is, in part, mediated by JAK1.
