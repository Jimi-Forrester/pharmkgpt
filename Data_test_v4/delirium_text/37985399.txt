37985399|a|INTRODUCTION: The molecular mechanisms that contribute to sex differences, in particular female predominance, in Alzheimer's disease (AD) prevalence, symptomology, and pathology, are incompletely understood. METHODS: To address this problem, we investigated cellular metabolism and immune responses ("immunometabolism endophenotype") across AD individuals as a function of sex with diverse clinical diagnosis of cognitive status at death (cogdx), Braak staging, and Consortium to Establish a Registry for AD (CERAD) scores using human cortex metabolomics and transcriptomics data from the Religious Orders Study / Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP) cohort. RESULTS: We identified sex-specific metabolites, immune and metabolic genes, and pathways associated with the AD diagnosis and progression. We identified female-specific elevation in glycerophosphorylcholine and N-acetylglutamate, which are AD inflammatory metabolites involved in interleukin (IL)-17 signaling, C-type lectin receptor, interferon signaling, and Toll-like receptor pathways. We pinpointed distinct microglia-specific immunometabolism endophenotypes (i.e., lipid- and amino acid-specific IL-10 and IL-17 signaling pathways) between female and male AD subjects. In addition, female AD subjects showed evidence of diminished excitatory neuron and microglia communications via glutamate-mediated immunometabolism. DISCUSSION: Our results point to new understanding of the molecular basis for female predominance in AD, and warrant future independent validations with ethnically diverse patient cohorts to establish a likely causal relationship of microglial immunometabolism in the sex differences in AD. HIGHLIGHTS: Sex-specific immune metabolites, gene networks and pathways, are associated with Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis and disease progression. Female AD subjects exhibit microglial immunometabolism endophenotypes characterized by decreased glutamate metabolism and elevated interleukin-10 pathway activity. Female AD subjects showed a shift in glutamate-mediated cell-cell communications between excitatory neurons to microglia and astrocyte.
