37375261|t|CXCR4-Targeted Radiopharmaceuticals for the Imaging and Therapy of Malignant Tumors.
37375261|a|C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4), also known as fusin or CD184, is a 7-transmembrane helix G-protein-coupled receptor that is encoded by the CXCR4 gene. Involved in various physiological processes, CXCR4 could form an interaction with its endogenous partner, chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12), which is also named SDF-1. In the past several decades, the CXCR4/CXCL12 couple has attracted a large amount of research interest due to its critical functions in the occurrence and development of refractory diseases, such as HIV infection, inflammatory diseases, and metastatic cancer, including breast cancer, gastric cancer, and non-small cell lung cancer. Furthermore, overexpression of CXCR4 in tumor tissues was shown to have a high correlation with tumor aggressiveness and elevated risks of metastasis and recurrence. The pivotal roles of CXCR4 have encouraged an effort around the world to investigate CXCR4-targeted imaging and therapeutics. In this review, we would like to summarize the implementation of CXCR4-targeted radiopharmaceuticals in the field of various kinds of carcinomas. The nomenclature, structure, properties, and functions of chemokines and chemokine receptors are briefly introduced. Radiopharmaceuticals that could target CXCR4 will be described in detail according to their structure, such as pentapeptide-based structures, heptapeptide-based structures, nonapeptide-based structures, etc. To make this review a comprehensive and informative article, we would also like to provide the predictive prospects for the CXCR4-targeted species in future clinical development.
