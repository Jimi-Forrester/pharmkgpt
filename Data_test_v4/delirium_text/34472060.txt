34472060|t|Preparation of Amyloid Fibrils Using Recombinant Technology.
34472060|a|Amyloid fibrils are widely investigated as they are directly associated with various neurodegenerative diseases. For example, a vast of experimental results have shown that the oligomeric and fibrillar aggregates of the amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) play a critical role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Therefore, the accessibility of certain amounts of pure Abeta peptide is necessary for the studies of the mechanism of neurotoxicity. In this regard, recombinant methods provide the possibility to synthesize the Abeta peptide in vitro and thus promote the investigation of the relationship between peptide structure and pathogenic mechanism. These investigations further provide the fundamental supports for developing potential drugs for AD treatment. In addition to providing support for the study of pathogenic mechanisms, the recombination of Abeta peptides also offers the possibility to utilize these unique protein nanomaterials. For example, Abeta peptides tend to assemble into chiral amyloid fibrils with an ultra-high aspect ratio. These unique nano features, together with the inherent protein characteristics, of amyloid fibrils, allow them to be used in biomedical and environmental fields. Accordingly, herein, we aim to introduce the recombinant protocols for the synthesis of Abeta peptides. The experimental route to assemble these peptides to amyloid fibrils is also summarized in this chapter.
