22874105|t|Apolipoprotein E and kidney function in older adults.
22874105|a|BACKGROUND: Previous studies suggest that the epsilon4 and epsilon2 alleles of apolipoprotein E (APOE) may be associated with decreased and increased risks of CKD, respectively, but there are limited data in older adults. We evaluated the associations of apolipoprotein E alleles with kidney function among older adults in the cardiovascular health study (CHS). METHODS: Caucasian participants had APOE allelic analysis and serum creatinine and cystatin C measured at baseline (n = 3,844 for cross sectional analysis) and in follow up (n = 3,226 for longitudinal analysis). APOE variation was evaluated as an additive model with number of epsilon2, epsilon3 and epsilon4 alleles. GFR was estimated using the CKD epidemiology equation (eGFRcreat) and the cystatin C demographic equation (eGFRcys). The primary outcome was CKD defined by eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2. The secondary outcome was rapid progression defined by annual loss of eGFR > 3 ml/min/1.73 m2. RESULTS: Mean eGFRcreat was 72 ml/min/1.73 m2 (25% CKD). Compared with the epsilon3 allele, the APOE epsilon4 allele was associated with reduced risk of CKD by eGFRcreat: unadjusted odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.79 (0.67 - 0.93) per allele, fully adjusted OR (95% CI) 0.80 (0.68 - 0.96) per allele. Results were consistent using eGFRcys. There was no association of the epsilon2 allele with CKD or between the apolipoprotein E gene with rapid progression. CONCLUSIONS: The apolipoprotein epsilon4 allele was associated with lower odds of CKD in elderly Caucasian individuals. Future research should confirm these findings in other races and explore mechanisms to explain these results.
