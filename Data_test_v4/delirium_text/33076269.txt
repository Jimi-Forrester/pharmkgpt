33076269|t|Post-Transcriptional Expression Control in Platelet Biogenesis and Function.
33076269|a|Platelets are highly abundant cell fragments of the peripheral blood that originate from megakaryocytes. Beside their well-known role in wound healing and hemostasis, they are emerging mediators of the immune response and implicated in a variety of pathophysiological conditions including cancer. Despite their anucleate nature, they harbor a diverse set of RNAs, which are subject to an active sorting mechanism from megakaryocytes into proplatelets and affect platelet biogenesis and function. However, sorting mechanisms are poorly understood, but RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) have been suggested to play a crucial role. Moreover, RBPs may regulate RNA translation and decay following platelet activation. In concert with other regulators, including microRNAs, long non-coding and circular RNAs, RBPs control multiple steps of the platelet life cycle. In this review, we will highlight the different RNA species within platelets and their impact on megakaryopoiesis, platelet biogenesis and platelet function. Additionally, we will focus on the currently known concepts of post-transcriptional control mechanisms important for RNA fate within platelets with a special emphasis on RBPs.
