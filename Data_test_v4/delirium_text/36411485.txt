36411485|a|Hair graying, a prototypical sign of human aging, is a progressive loss of pigmentation from growing hair shafts caused by disease and as a side effect of medications. Cerebrolysin is a neuropeptide preparation that mimics the effect of endogenous neurotrophic factors. Cerebrolysin has been widely used in neurologic conditions, such as cerebral stroke, Alzheimer's disease, and dementia, among others. Cerebrolysin treatment has achieved to regain or maintain the cognitive ability of affected patients; however, up to date, there are no reports about the reactivation of hair pigmentation. We describe a previously not described effect occurring on patients receiving Cerebrolysin treatment for neurologic diseases and whether this effect is associated in reactivation of melanocytes and melanin expression. Here, we report five patients (mean age, 70.6 years), who also had age-related hair graying and scalp hair repigmentation during Cerebrolysin treatment. Macroscopic analysis revealed hair repigmentation consisted in diffuse darkening of the scalp hair. Impregnation and immunostaining analysis were performed on scalp biopsies taken before and after Cerebrolysin treatment; the results showed greater melanin and melanocyte marker MART-1/Melan-A staining following Cerebrolysin treatment. We present, to our knowledge, the first report on hair repigmentation is a previously not described effect occurring following Cerebrolysin treatment.
