35418747|t|Association Between Dynapenic Abdominal Obesity and Fall Risk in Older Adults.
35418747|a|Background: In recent years, dynapenic abdominal obesity has received more and more attention. This article aimed to explore the relationship between dynapenic abdominal obesity and fall risk in older adults. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, according to waist circumference (>=90 cm for men and >=85 cm for women) and handgrip strength (<28 kg for men and <18 kg for women), 551 older adults were divided into four groups: dynapenic abdominal obese (D/AO), dynapenic nonabdominal obese (D/NAO), nondynapenic abdominal obese (ND/AO) and nondynapenic nonabdominal obese (ND/NAO). Fall risk was measured by the Tinetti performance-oriented mobility assessment (POMA). Binary logistic regression was used to explore the relationship between D/AO and fall risk. Results: D/AO was related to POMA score (odds ratio [OR]=3.39; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.47-7.81; P=0.004) after adjusting the confounding variables. However, D/NAO (OR=1.51; 95% CI:0.69-3.32; P=0.302) and ND/AO (OR=1.48; 95% CI:0.74-2.99; P=0.272) were not associated with POMA score. Conclusion: This study suggests that older adults with D/AO have a higher risk of falls. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the attention to D/AO and relevant interventions should be implemented.
