33097803|t|A novel bioassay for quantification of surface Cannabinoid receptor 1 expression.
33097803|a|The cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1) plays critical roles in multiple physiological processes such as pain perception, brain development and body temperature regulation. Mutations on this gene (CNR1), results in altered functionality and/or biosynthesis such as reduced membrane expression, changes in mRNA stability or changes in downstream signaling that act as triggers for diseases such as obesity, Parkinson's, Huntington's, among others; thus, it is considered as a potential pharmacological target. To date, multiple quantification methods have been employed to determine how these mutations affect receptor expression and localization; however, they present serious disadvantages that may arise quantifying errors. Here, we describe a sensitive bioassay to quantify receptor surface expression; in this bioassay the Gaussia Luciferase (GLuc) was fused to the extracellular portion of the CB1. The GLuc activity was assessed by coelenterazine addition to the medium followed by immediate readout. Based on GLuc activity assay, we show that the GLuc signals corelate with CB1 localization, besides, we showed the assay's functionality and reliability by comparing its results with those generated by previously reported mutations on the CNR1 gene and by using flow cytometry to determine the cell surface receptor expression. Detection of membrane-bound CB1, and potentially other GPCRs, is able to quickly screen for receptor levels and help to understand the effect of clinically relevant mutations or polymorphisms.
