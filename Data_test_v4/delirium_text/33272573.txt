33272573|a|Formation of Abeta oligomers and fibrils plays a central role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. There are two major forms of Abeta in the brain: Abeta42 and Abeta40. Abeta42 is the major component of the amyloid plaques, but the overall abundance of Abeta40 is several times that of Abeta42. In vitro experiments show that Abeta42 and Abeta40 affect each other's aggregation. In mouse models of Alzheimer's disease, overexpression of Abeta40 has been shown to reduce the plaque pathology, suggesting that Abeta42 and Abeta40 also interact in vivo. Here we address the question of whether Abeta42 and Abeta40 interact with each other in the formation of oligomers using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. When the Abeta42 oligomers were formed using only spin-labeled Abeta42, the dipolar interaction between spin labels that are within 20 A range broadened the EPR spectrum and reduced its amplitude. Oligomers formed with a mixture of spin-labeled Abeta42 and wild-type Abeta42 gave an EPR spectrum with higher amplitude due to weakened spin-spin interactions, suggesting molecular mixing of labeled and wild-type Abeta42. When spin-labeled Abeta42 and wild-type Abeta40 were mixed to form oligomers, the resulting EPR spectrum also showed reduced amplitude, suggesting that wild-type Abeta40 can also form oligomers with spin-labeled Abeta42. Therefore, our results suggest that Abeta42 and Abeta40 form mixed oligomers with direct molecular interactions. Our results point to the importance of investigating Abeta42-Abeta40 interactions in the brain for a complete understanding of Alzheimer's pathogenesis and therapeutic interventions.
