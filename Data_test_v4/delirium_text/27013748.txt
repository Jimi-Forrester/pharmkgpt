27013748|t|Association between frailty, cerebral oxygenation and adverse post-operative outcomes in elderly patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery: An observational pilot study.
27013748|a|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Although both frailty and low cerebral oxygen saturation increase the risk of post-operative complications, their relationship is yet to be investigated. The purpose of this observational study was to investigate the association between frailty, intraoperative cerebral oxygen saturation and post-operative complications in elderly patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery. METHODS: After approval from the Institutional Review Board, 25 elderly patients (>65 years) undergoing non-cardiac major surgery were included in this study. Pre-operatively, all included patients were assessed for frailty and classified into frail and non-frail groups. All patients had routine intraoperative monitors, and a cerebral oximeter applied during anaesthesia. The 'intraoperative' anaesthesiologist and the post-operative study investigator were blinded to cerebral oximeter readings throughout the study. The incidence of significant intraoperative cerebral oxygen desaturation, adverse post-operative outcomes and length of hospital stay were compared. Statistical significance was defined as a value of P < 0.05. RESULTS: We found that the frail group had more intraoperative cerebral desaturation (odds ratio [OR] [95% confidence interval [CI]]: 1.75 [1.11-2.75]) and longer median (interquartile range) length of hospital stay compared to the non-frail group (13.5 days [8.75-27.5] and 8 days [6-11], respectively). Furthermore, in patients with a low-baseline cerebral oxygen saturation (<55%), intraoperative cerebral desaturation (OR [95% CI]: 2.10 [1.00-4.42]), adverse post-operative outcomes (OR [95% CI]: 1.80 [1.00-3.23]) and median (interquartile range) length of hospital stay (15 days [9-31.5] vs. 9 days [6.25-13.75], P = 0.04) were significantly higher compared to subjects with higher baseline (>=55%) cerebral oxygen saturation. CONCLUSIONS: Frail patients have more intraoperative cerebral desaturation and longer lengths of hospital stay compared to non-frail patients.
