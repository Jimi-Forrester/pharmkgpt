39071620|t|The role of AMPKalpha subunit in Alzheimer's disease: In-depth analysis and future prospects.
39071620|a|The AMP-activated protein kinase alpha (AMPKalpha) subunit is the catalytic subunit in the AMPK complex, playing a crucial role in AMPK activation. It has two isoforms: AMPKalpha1 and AMPKalpha2. Emerging evidence suggests that the AMPKalpha subunit exhibits subtype-specific effects in Alzheimer's disease (AD). This review discusses the role of the AMPKalpha subunit in the pathogenesis of AD, including its impact on beta-amyloid (Abeta) pathology, Tau pathology, metabolic disorders, inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammasome and pyroptosis. Additionally, it reviews the distinct roles of its isoforms, AMPKalpha1 and AMPKalpha2, in AD, which may provide more precise targets for future drug development in AD.
