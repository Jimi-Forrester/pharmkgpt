39471005|t|Medicinal Plants Derived Green Carbon Dots: Synthesis, Characterization and Their Potential Applications in Cancer Therapy.
39471005|a|OBJECTIVE: This review aims to explore the synthesis, characterization, and potential applications of carbon dots (CDs) derived from medicinal plants for cancer prevention, highlighting their role as a promising alternative in nanotechnological approaches. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted to gather information on the synthesis methods, complex matrices, characterization techniques, and potential applications of CDs derived from medicinal plants in cancer therapy. RESULT: Carbon dots (CDs) have emerged as a subject of significant interest due to their favorable chemical and biological properties. Various precursors, including graphite, carbon black, and organic molecules, are utilized in the synthesis of CDs through chemical or physical methods. Notably, CDs derived from medicinal plants offer environmentally friendly alternatives, leveraging complex matrices such as aqueous, alcoholic, and hydroalcoholic extracts. This review emphasizes the green synthesis approaches, characterization techniques, and diverse applications of CDs, including drug transport, bioimaging, biosensing, and anti-cancer therapies. Furthermore, it highlights the advantages and disadvantages of different synthesis methods, aiding researchers in selecting appropriate techniques for continuous production. CONCLUSION: Carbon dots (CDs) represent a transformative advancement in nanotheranostics, offering a versatile platform for precise cancer diagnosis and therapy. With inherent anticancer properties, CDs hold promise in photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT), enabling precise tumor targeting while minimizing systemic toxicity. To address the limitations of standalone PDT and PTT, researchers are exploring multimodal treatment approaches integrating CDs. By leveraging the unique properties of CDs derived from medicinal plants, a new era of precision cancer therapy may be realized, emphasizing enhanced therapeutic outcomes and reduced adverse effects.
