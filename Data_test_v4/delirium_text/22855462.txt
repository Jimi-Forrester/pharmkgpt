22855462|t|Reversal of paralysis and reduced inflammation from peripheral administration of beta-amyloid in TH1 and TH17 versions of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.
22855462|a|beta-Amyloid 42 (Abeta42) and beta-amyloid 40 (Abeta40), major components of senile plaque deposits in Alzheimer's disease, are considered neurotoxic and proinflammatory. In multiple sclerosis, Abeta42 is up-regulated in brain lesions and damaged axons. We found, unexpectedly, that treatment with either Abeta42 or Abeta40 peptides reduced motor paralysis and brain inflammation in four different models of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) with attenuation of motor paralysis, reduction of inflammatory lesions in the central nervous system (CNS), and suppression of lymphocyte activation. Abeta42 and Abeta40 treatments were effective in reducing ongoing paralysis induced with adoptive transfer of either autoreactive T helper 1 (T(H)1) or T(H)17 cells. High-dimensional 14-parameter flow cytometry of peripheral immune cell populations after in vivo Abeta42 and Abeta40 treatment revealed substantial modulations in the percentage of lymphoid and myeloid subsets during EAE. Major proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines were reduced in the blood after Abeta peptide treatment. Protection conferred by Abeta treatment did not require its delivery to the brain: Adoptive transfer with lymphocytes from donors treated with Abeta42 attenuated EAE in wild-type recipient mice, and Abeta deposition in the brain was not detected in treated EAE mice by immunohistochemical analysis. In contrast to the improvement in EAE with Abeta treatment, EAE was worse in mice with genetic deletion of the amyloid precursor protein. Therefore, in the absence of Abeta, there is exacerbated clinical EAE disease progression. Because Abeta42 and Abeta40 ameliorate experimental autoimmune inflammation targeting the CNS, we might now consider its potential anti-inflammatory role in other neuropathological conditions.
