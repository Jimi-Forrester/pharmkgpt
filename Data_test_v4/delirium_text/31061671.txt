31061671|t|Evaluation of In Vitro Antioxidant and Antidiabetic Activities of Aristolochia longa Extracts.
31061671|a|Oxidative stress plays a major role in diabetic physiopathology; hence, the interest of using natural antioxidants as therapeutic tools exists. The aim of this study was the evaluation of in vitro antioxidant activity and inhibitory potential of organic extracts from Aristolochia longa roots against key enzymes linked to hyperglycemia. Antioxidant activity was performed using 2,2'-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) radicals and ferric reducing/antioxidant power (FRAP) methods. The alpha-Glucosidase and beta-Galactosidase inhibitory activities were investigated using an in vitro model. Moreover, phytochemical analysis of tested extracts was carried out. The aqueous fraction of this herb exhibited the highest antioxidant activity for both DPPH and ABTS methods, IC50=125.40+-2.40 mug/mL and IC50=65.23+-2.49 mug/mL, respectively. However, the ethyl acetate fraction possessed the strongest inhibitory effect towards alpha-Glucosidase (IC50=1.112+-0.026 mg/mL). Furthermore, the result showed high levels of phenolic content. The results showed that this plant could be a significant source of medically important natural compounds.
