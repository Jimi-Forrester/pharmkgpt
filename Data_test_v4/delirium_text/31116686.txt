31116686|a|Previous studies demonstrated that cells inhibit protein synthesis as a compensatory mechanism for mitochondrial dysfunction. Protein synthesis can be attenuated by 1) the inhibition of mTOR kinase, which results in a decrease in the phosphorylation of S6K1 and 4E-BP1 proteins, and 2) an increase in the phosphorylation of eIF2alpha protein. The present study investigated both of these pathways under conditions of short-term acute and long-term mitochondrial stress. Short-term responses were triggered in mammalian cells by treatment with menadione, antimycin A, or CCCP. Long-term mitochondrial stress was induced by prolonged treatment with menadione or rotenone and expression of genetic alterations, such as knocking down the MIA40 oxidoreductase or knocking out NDUFA11 protein. Short-term menadione, antimycin A, or CCCP cell treatment led to the inhibition of protein synthesis, accompanied by a decrease in mTOR kinase activity, an increase in the phosphorylation of eIF2alpha (Ser51), and an increase in the level of ATF4 transcription factor. Conversely, long-term stress led to a decrease in eIF2alpha (Ser51) phosphorylation and ATF4 expression and to an increase in S6K1 (Thr389) phosphorylation. Thus, under long-term mitochondrial stress, cells trigger long-lasting adaptive responses for protection against excessive inhibition of protein synthesis.
