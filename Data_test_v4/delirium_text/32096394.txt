32096394|t|[Present research situation and prospect for delirium recognition based on electronic medical record].
32096394|a|Delirium is a common complication in elderly inpatients which could result in cognitive impairment, and increase the risk of disability, fall and mortality. Moreover, it could cause heavy social burden. Even with multiple bedside screening scales to detect delirium, the rate of missed diagnosis is still high. Maybe it is associated with the acute fluctuation and nocturnal onset of delirium. With the development of the intelligence and automation of the electronic medical record (EMR), previous studies have explored the use of EMR to identify delirium patients, and this method provides help for delirium diagnosis and prevention. In this paper, we reviewed and summarized the current situation of research on delirium recognition by EMR, and put forward the development prospect in this method in order to provide basis and lay a foundation for intelligent diagnosis of delirium.
