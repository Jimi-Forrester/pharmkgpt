15200500|t|Cholesterol at the crossroads: Alzheimer's disease and lipid metabolism.
15200500|a|Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a devastating disease that affects millions of elderly persons. Despite years of intense investigations, genetic risk factors that affect the majority of AD cases have yet to be determined. Recent studies suggest that cholesterol metabolism has integral part in AD pathogenesis, suggesting that genes that regulate lipid metabolism may also play roles in AD. This review will first describe emerging evidence that links cholesterol to the mechanisms thought to underlie AD. Based on this rationale, candidate genes located in regions implicated in AD that have roles in lipid metabolism will then be discussed.
