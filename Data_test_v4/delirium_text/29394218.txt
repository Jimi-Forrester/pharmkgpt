29394218|t|Urinary Management With an External Female Collection Device.
29394218|a|BACKGROUND: Strategies to decrease use of female indwelling urinary catheters and catheter-associated urinary tract infections are challenging due to the limited availability of proper fitting external collection devices. Female urinary incontinence predisposes the skin to potential pain, itching, burning, infection, or pressure injuries. CASE STUDIES: This article discusses 3 patients' trajectory of care with use of an external female urinary collection device. All of these females were incontinent of urine after the indwelling urinary catheter was removed and managed with an external female urinary collection device. CONCLUSIONS: The use of an external female urinary collection device is a feasible alternative to an indwelling urinary catheter as well as managing urinary incontinence.
