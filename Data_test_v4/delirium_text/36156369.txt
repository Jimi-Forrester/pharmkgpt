36156369|t|Targeted delivery strategy: A beneficial partner for emerging senotherapy.
36156369|a|Numerous cutting-edge studies have confirmed that the slow accumulation of cell cycle arrested and secretory cells, called senescent cells (SCs), in tissues is an important negative factor, or even the culprit, in age- associated diseases such as non-alcoholic fatty liver, Alzheimer's disease, type 2 diabetes, atherosclerosis, and malignant tumors. With further understanding of cellular senescence, SCs are important effective targets for the treatment of senescence-related diseases, called the Senotherapy. However, existing therapies, including Senolytics (which lyse SCs) and Senostatic (which regulate senescence-associated secretory phenotype), do not have the properties to target SCs, and side effects due to non-specific distribution are one of the hindrances to clinical use of Senotherapy. In the past few decades, targeted delivery has attracted much attention and been developed as a recognized diagnostic and therapeutic novel tool, due to the advantages of visualization of targets, more accurate drug/gene delivery, and ultimately "reduced toxicity and enhanced efficacy". Despite considerable advances in achieving targeted delivery, it has not yet been widely used in Senotherapy. In this review, we clarify the challenge for Senotherapy, then discuss how different targeted strategies contribute to imaging or therapy for SCs in terms of different biomarkers of SCs. Finally, the emerging nano-Senotherapy is prospected.
