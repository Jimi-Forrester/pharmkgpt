37059995|t|Methadone rotation versus other opioid rotation for refractory cancer induced bone pain: protocol of an exploratory randomised controlled open-label study.
37059995|a|BACKGROUND: A third of patients with advanced cancer and bone metastasis suffer from cancer induced bone pain (CIBP), impeding quality of life, psychological distress, depression and anxiety. This study will evaluate the impact of an opioid rotation, comparing methadone rotation with other opioid rotation in patients with refractory CIBP. METHODS: This open-label randomised controlled trial will recruit cancer patients with CIBP and inadequate pain control despite established baseline opioid and/or intolerable opioid side effects from cancer and palliative care services. Participants will be at least 18 years old, with a predicted prognosis of greater than 8 weeks, meet the core diagnostic criteria for CIBP, have a worst pain score of >= 4 of 10 from CIBP and/ or have opioid toxicity (graded >= 2 on Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events). Participants will have sufficiently proficient English to complete questionnaires and provide informed consent. Participants will be randomised 1:1 to be rotated to methadone to another opioid. The primary objective is to examine the impact of opioid rotation in improving CIBP by comparing analgesic efficacy, safety and tolerability in the two arms. Secondary objectives will assess changes in the intensity, duration and frequency of breakthrough pain, requirement of breakthrough analgesia, overall opioid escalation index, and time taken to observe improvement in pain reduction, pain interference and quality of life. DISCUSSION: Laboratory studies suggest the involvement of neuropathic involvement in the mechanism of CIBP, though there remains no clear evidence of the routine use of neuropathic agents. Methadone as an analgesic agent may have a role to play in this cohort of patients, thus warranting further exploratory studies.
