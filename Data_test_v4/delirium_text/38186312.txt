38186312|t|Functional role of translocator protein and its ligands in ocular diseases (Review).
38186312|a|The 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO) is an essential outer mitochondrial membrane protein that is responsible for mitochondrial transport, maintenance of mitochondrial homeostasis and normal physiological cell function. The role of TSPO in the pathogenesis of ocular diseases is a growing area of interest. More notably, TSPO exerts positive effects in regulating various pathophysiological processes, such as the inflammatory response, oxidative stress, steroid synthesis and modulation of microglial function, in combination with a variety of specific ligands such as 1-(2-chlorophenyl-N-methylpropyl)-3-isoquinolinecarboxamide, 4'-chlorodiazepam and XBD173. In the present review, the expression of TSPO in ocular tissues and the functional role of TSPO and its ligands in diverse ocular diseases was discussed.
