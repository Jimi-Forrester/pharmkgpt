28728199|t|[Polypharmacy - Solutions for Enhanced Drug Safety].
28728199|a|Polypharmacy (>= 5 drugs) is common among older people and may lead to falls, ADEs and delirium. Adherence is an important part in the medication management. Simple questions (i. e. for OTC, handling and omission of drugs) are effective. As most old people are treated by general practitioners (GP), they play a key role for drug safety and reducing polypharmacy. The involvement of pharmacists in analyzing one patient's drugs can enhance solutions for drug problems ("two-man rule"). An IT-based medication plan acts as an important communication tool for an enhanced team work between doctors, pharmacists and nursing care.
