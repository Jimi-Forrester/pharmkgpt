18780971|a|The main objective of this study was to assess the economic cost of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in Shanghai, China, as a pilot study for future evaluations. Sixty-seven patients with AD were interviewed, and the information of the AD-related cost and resources used was collected from October 2005 to September 2006. By retrospective analysis, annual costs were calculated and expressed in Chinese renminbi (RMB). Direct cost per patient per year averaged approximately 8,432 RMB (1,058 USD), indirect cost per patient per year was 10,568 RMB (1,326 USD), and annual costs were 19,001 RMB (2,384 USD) per patient per year in this investigation. Total cost was significantly associated with the degree of severity including cognitive function (MMSE) and activity of daily living (ADL). With the increase in the number of persons at risk for developing AD, the economic burden of AD patients in China is significantly heavy.
