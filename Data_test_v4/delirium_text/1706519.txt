1706519|t|Straight and paired helical filaments in Alzheimer disease have a common structural unit.
1706519|a|The presence of abundant neurofibrillary tangles in certain areas of the brain constitutes one of the defining pathological characteristics of Alzheimer disease. The predominant component of the tangle is an abnormal fibrous assembly known as the paired helical filament (PHF). The PHF is formed by a twisted double-helical ribbon of subunits that gives rise to an image alternating in width between 8 nm and 20 nm with a cross-over spacing of 80 nm. Also found in tangles is the straight filament (SF), a different kind of abnormal filament, about 15 nm wide, that does not exhibit the marked modulation in width shown by the PHF. It is reported herein that PHFs and SFs form hybrid filaments displaying both morphologies, that PHFs and SFs share surface epitopes, and that computed maps reveal a similar C-shaped morphological unit in PHFs and SFs, though differing in relative arrangement in the two types of filament. The observations imply that the SF is a structural variant of the PHF and establish a common unit of assembly for these two pathological filaments.
