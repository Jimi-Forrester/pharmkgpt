37003185|t|Developmental and homeostatic signaling transmitted by the G-protein coupled receptor FPR2.
37003185|a|Formyl peptide receptor 2 (FPR2) and its mouse counterpart Fpr2 are the members of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. FPR2 is the only member of the FPRs that interacts with ligands from different sources. FPR2 is expressed in myeloid cells as well as epithelial cells, endothelial cells, neurons, and hepatocytes. During the past years, some unusual properties of FPR2 have attracted intense attention because FPR2 appears to possess dual functions by activating or inhibiting intracellular signal pathways based on the nature, concentration of the ligands, and the temporal and spatial settings of the microenvironment in vivo, the cell types it interacts with. Therefore, FPR2 controls an abundant array of developmental and homeostatic signaling cascades, in addition to its "classical" capacity to mediate the migration of hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cells including malignant cells. In this review, we summarize recent development in FPR2 research, particularly in its role in diseases, therefore helping to establish FPR2 as a potential target for therapeutic intervention.
