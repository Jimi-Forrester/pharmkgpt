31200706|a|BACKGROUND: Little attention has been paid to neurotoxicants on the risk of dementia. Exposure to known neurotoxicants such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and organochlorine (OC) pesticides is suspected to have adverse cognitive effects in older populations. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether plasma concentrations of PCBs and OC pesticides are associated with the risk of cognitive decline, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and of all-cause dementia in the Canadian older population. METHODS: Analyses were based on data from the Canadian Study of Health and Aging, a 3-phase, 10-year population-based study of individuals aged 65+ years. Analyses included 669 clinically assessed subjects, of which 156 developed dementia including 108 incident cases of AD. Subjects were screened at each phase with the 100-point Modified Mini-Mental State Examination (3MS), a measurement of global cognitive function. Statistical analyses included Cox proportional hazards model when the outcome was dementia or AD, and a repeated-measure mixed model when the outcome was the 3MS score. RESULTS: No association of PCB and OC pesticides with the risk of dementia and AD was observed. Elevated concentrations of PCB congeners nos 118, 153, 156, 163, and OC pesticides 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane (p,p'-DDT) and its metabolite 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethylene (p,p'-DDE) were significantly associated with cognitive decline as assessed with the 3MS. A posteriori analyses suggested that only p,p'-DDE was significantly related to a higher cognitive decline in time based on the 3MS among incident cases of dementia compared to subjects remaining nondemented. CONCLUSION: PCB and OC pesticide plasma concentrations were not related to the incident diagnosis of neither dementia, nor AD. Using the 3MS scores as the outcome, higher concentrations of four PCB congeners and two OC pesticides were associated with lower cognitive performances in subjects. The association of p,p'-DDE with cognitive decline in time in incident cases of dementia merits further investigation.
