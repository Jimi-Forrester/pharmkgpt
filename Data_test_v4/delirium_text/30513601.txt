30513601|t|Chemically-Induced Production of Anti-Inflammatory Molecules in Microalgae.
30513601|a|Microalgae have been widely recognized as a valuable source of natural, bioactive molecules that can benefit human health. Some molecules of commercial value synthesized by the microalgal metabolism have been proven to display anti-inflammatory activity, including the carotenoids lutein and astaxanthin, the fatty acids EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) and DHA (docosahexaenoic acid), and sulphated polysaccharides. These molecules can accumulate to a certain extent in a diversity of microalgae species. A production process could become commercially feasible if the productivity is high and the overall production process costs are minimized. The productivity of anti-inflammatory molecules depends on each algal species and the cultivation conditions, the latter being mostly related to nutrient starvation and/or extremes of temperature and/or light intensity. Furthermore, novel bioprocess tools have been reported which might improve the biosynthesis yields and productivity of those target molecules and reduce production costs simultaneously. Such novel tools include the use of chemical triggers or enhancers to improve algal growth and/or accumulation of bioactive molecules, the algal growth in foam and the surfactant-mediated extraction of valuable compounds. Taken together, the recent findings suggest that the combined use of novel bioprocess strategies could improve the technical efficiency and commercial feasibility of valuable microalgal bioproducts production, particularly anti-inflammatory compounds, in large scale processes.
