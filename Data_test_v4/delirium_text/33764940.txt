33764940|t|Effects of Slowness, Frailty, Insufficient Intake, and Delirium in Patients Following Cardiac Surgery: A Cohort Study.
33764940|a|BACKGROUND: Slow gait, frailty, insufficient postoperative caloric intake, and delirium, although seemingly distinct, can appear simultaneously in patients who underwent cardiac surgery. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate how these 4 factors overlap and how they individually and cumulatively affect cardiac surgery outcomes. METHODS: The effects of slowness (gait speed <0.83 m/s), frailty (>=3/5 Fried criteria), insufficient postoperative intake (<800 kcal/d), and delirium (defined by the Confusion Assessment Method) on hospital length of stay (LOS) and 3-month mortality were analyzed in 308 adult patients. RESULTS: Slowness, frailty, insufficient intake, and delirium affected 27.5%, 29.5%, 31.5%, and 13.3% of participants, respectively; only 42.2% (130/308) were free from these risks. Risk overlap was prevalent, as 26.3% (n = 81) had 2 or more risk factors. The most obvious overlap was in delirium (80% of delirious participants had other risks), suggesting that delirium cannot be managed in isolation. Individually, whereas slowness was associated only with longer LOS, frailty, insufficient intake, and delirium all led to longer LOS and higher mortality. When equally weighting each risk factor to analyze their cumulative effects, LOS increased by 4.4 days (95% confidence interval, 3.0-5.7) and 3-month mortality increased by 2.6-fold (95% confidence interval, 1.4-4.6), with each risk factor added, independent of participants' educational level, body mass index, and risk for cardiac surgery (EuroSCORE II >=6). CONCLUSIONS: Because a clinical overlap of slowness, frailty, insufficient postoperative intake, and delirium was evident in patients who underwent cardiac surgery, and risk of death and longer hospital stay increased with each factor added, care should be revised to consider these overlapping factors to maximize patient outcomes.
