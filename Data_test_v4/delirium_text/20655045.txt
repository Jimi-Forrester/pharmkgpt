20655045|a|Imaging of the mechanical properties of in vivo brain tissue could eventually lead to non-invasive diagnosis of hydrocephalus, Alzheimer's disease and other pathologies known to alter the intracranial environment. The purpose of this work is to (1) use time-harmonic magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) to estimate the mechanical property distribution of cerebral tissue in the normal feline brain and (2) compare the recovered properties of grey and white matter. Various in vivo and ex vivo brain tissue property measurement strategies have led to the highly variable results that have been reported in the literature. MR elastography is an imaging technique that can estimate mechanical properties of tissue non-invasively and in vivo. Data was acquired in 14 felines and elastic parameters were estimated using a globo-regional nonlinear image reconstruction algorithm. Results fell within the range of values reported in the literature and showed a mean shear modulus across the subject group of 7-8 kPa with all but one animal falling within 5-15 kPa. White matter was statistically stiffer (p<0.01) than grey matter by about 1 kPa on a per subject basis. To the best of our knowledge, the results reported represent the most extensive set of estimates in the in vivo brain which have been based on MRE acquisition of the three-dimensional displacement field coupled to volumetric shear modulus image reconstruction achieved through nonlinear parameter estimation. However, the inter-subject variation in mean shear modulus indicates the need for further study, including the possibility of applying more advanced models to estimate the relevant tissue mechanical properties from the data.
