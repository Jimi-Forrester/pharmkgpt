31614008|a|OBJECTIVE: To assess a possible relationship between maternal cognitive dysfunction during pregnancy and hypothyroxinemia, adjusted for major confounders. BACKGROUND: Thyroid dysfunction in general is associated with cognitive dysfunction. Cognitive dysfunction is common during pregnancy. DESIGN: Prospective follow-up study from 12 to 32 weeks of pregnancy. PARTICIPANTS: 2082 healthy pregnant women. MEASUREMENTS: Cognitive function, depression and sleeping problems were assessed by self-report questionnaires at 12, 22 and 32 weeks of gestation, higher scores reflecting more symptoms. FT4, TSH and TPO-Ab were assessed at 12 weeks of gestation. DEFINITIONS: healthy (euthyroxinemia) control group: FT4 within 10-90th percentiles, without elevated TPO-Ab titres and TSH within first trimester-specific reference range (0.23-4.0 mU/L). Hypothyroxinemia: FT4 <2.5th percentile with TSH within first trimester-specific reference range. Poor cognitive function: a score >1 SD > mean on the cognitive function scale. RESULTS: A total of 54 women showed hypothyroxinemia and 1476 women had euthyroxinemia. At 12 weeks, multiple logistic regression showed that poor cognitive function was independently related to hypothyroxinemia: OR: 2.9 (95% CI: 1.6-5.4), adjusted for depression (OR: 3.1; 95% CI: 2.7-4.6) and sleeping problems (OR: 2.8, 95% CI: 1.9-3.9). TPO-Ab + women with hypothyroxinemia had the highest levels of cognitive dysfunction. Other cut-offs of hypothyroxinemia (<5th or <10th percentile with normal TSH) showed similar results. GLM-ANOVA showed that throughout pregnancy women with hypothyroxinemia at 12 weeks had significantly higher cognitive dysfunction scores compared with the healthy controls: F = 12.1, P = .001. CONCLUSIONS: Women with hypothyroxinemia during early gestation are at risk for poor cognitive function throughout gestation, adjusted for depression and sleeping problems.
