34159014|a|Introduction Catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) is a relatively common cause of postoperative morbidity in colorectal surgery patients. It has been associated with increased length of stay and mortality. Methods We performed a retrospective cohort study of 620 colorectal surgeries to assess the prevalence of CAUTI and its relationship with preoperative and operative factors. We also sought to identify its association with postoperative outcomes. Results We found that CAUTI occurred in 20.6% of colorectal procedures. We found that CAUTI was associated with older patient age, female gender, higher BMI, higher American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification, lower hemoglobin, higher creatinine, lower albumin, urgent procedures, bilateral ureteric stent placement, usage of double-J (DJ) stents, postoperative abdominal sepsis, and perioperative steroid usage. CAUTI was also associated with the presence of underlying medical conditions such as hypertension, ischemic heart disease, chronic kidney disease, cerebrovascular disease, and diabetes. With regards to postoperative outcomes, it was associated with postoperative stroke, myocardial infarction, prolonged length of stay, Intensive care unit stay, and mortality. Conclusion CAUTI remains a significant cause of morbidity in colorectal patients. Our patient population had a significantly higher risk of CAUTI compared to other series. Though sometimes labelled a minor postoperative complication, its occurrence is associated with other more significant postoperative complications, including death.
