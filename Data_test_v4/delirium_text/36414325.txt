36414325|t|Synthesis of deoxy-Andrographolide Triazolyl Glycoconjugates for the Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease.
36414325|a|A new andrographolide-based terminal alkyne 3 was synthesized in good yield from deoxy-andrographolide 2, obtained from a natural compound andrographolide 1, which in turn was isolated from the leaves of the plant Andrographis paniculata. Copper(I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition reaction of alkyne 3 with azido-sugars 4a-f furnished a library of andrographolide-fastened triazolyl glycoconjugates 5a-f in good yields. The structures of these semisynthetic andrographolide derivatives were established by Fourier transform infrared, NMR, and mass spectroscopy. The compounds 5a-f were further evaluated against Alzheimer's disease (AD) using a scopolamine (SCOP)-induced memory impairment mice model. It was observed that antioxidant and anticholinesterase properties of these compounds contribute significantly toward their remarkable potential to improve cognitive functioning.
