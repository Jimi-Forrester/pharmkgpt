33103039|a|The increasing number of frail elderly people in our aging society is becoming problematic: about 11% of community-dwelling older persons are frail and another 42% are pre-frail. Consequently, a major challenge in the coming years will be to test people over the age of 60 years to detect pre-frailty at the earliest stage and to return them to robustness using the targeted interventions that are becoming increasingly available. This challenge requires individual longitudinal monitoring (ILM) or follow-up of community-dwelling older persons using quantitative approaches. This paper briefly describes an effort to tackle this challenge. Extending the detection of the pre-frail stages to other population groups is also suggested. Appropriate algorithms have been used to begin the tracing of faint physiological signals in order to detect transitions from robustness to pre-frailty states and from pre-frailty to frailty states. It is hoped that these studies will allow older adults to receive preventive treatment at the correct institutions and by the appropriate professionals as early as possible, which will prevent loss of autonomy. Altogether, ILM is conceived as an emerging property of databases ("digital twins") and not the reverse. Furthermore, ILM should facilitate a coordinated set of actions by the caregivers, which is a complex challenge in itself. This approach should be gradually extended to all ages, because frailty has no age, as is testified by overwork, burnout, and post-traumatic syndrome.
