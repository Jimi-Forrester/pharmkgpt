3577515|t|[Decrease in the concentration of leukocyte acetylation coenzyme associated with vitamin precursor deficiency in patients with alcoholic delirium].
3577515|a|Sixty-three patients with the typical variant of delirium tremens were examined. The results showed a marked reduction (by 8.7 times) in levels of coenzyme A (CoA) in leukocytes, which was indicative of deficiency of the coenzymic form of pantothenic acid (PA). Changes in CoA concentrations in leukocytes observed at the height of psychosis in patients with alcoholic delirium as compared to other parameters of PA metabolism have great significance for the assessment of vitamin metabolism. PA deficiency was more expressed in cases of long-standing and massive alcoholization which induces an earlier development of psychosis. CoA levels in leukocytes may be used as a parameter of detoxication processes in patients with delirium tremens. The data obtained are considered as indication for administration of PA drugs in combined detoxifying therapy of alcoholic psychoses.
