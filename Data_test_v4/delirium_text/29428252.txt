29428252|a|OBJECTIVES: To describe the prevalence and characteristics of delirium during the initial evaluation of critically ill patients aged 5-14 years. METHOD/DESIGN: This is a cross-sectional descriptive study in a critical care unit. For six months, all patients were evaluated within the first 24-72 hours or when sedation permitted the use of the paediatric confusion assessment method for the intensive care unit (PCAM-ICU) and the Delirium Rating Scale-Revised-98 items #7 and #8 to determine motor type. We report the characteristics of PCAM-ICU delirium (at least three of the required items scored positive) and of subthreshold score cases (two positive items). RESULTS: Of 77 admissions, 15 (19.5%) had delirium, and 11 (14.2%) were subthreshold. A total of 53.3% of delirium and 45.5% of subthreshold cases were hypoactive. The prevalence of delirium and subthreshold PCAM-ICU was 83.3% and 16.7% in mechanically ventilated children. The most frequent combination of PCAM-ICU alterations in subthreshold cases was acute onset-fluctuation with altered alertness. The main nursing diagnoses were related to reduced cellular respiration. CONCLUSIONS: Delirium is common in critically ill children. It is necessary to assess whether certain nursing diagnoses imply an increase in delirium. Longitudinal studies of subthreshold PCAM-ICU cases are needed to understand their importance better.
