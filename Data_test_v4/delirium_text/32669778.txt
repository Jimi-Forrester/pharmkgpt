32669778|a|OBJECTIVE: Insomnia and delirium have gained much attention since the publication of recent guidelines for the management in critically ill adults. Neurologic effects such as sleep disturbance, psychosis, and delirium are commonly cited adverse effects (AEs) of corticosteroids. Steroid use is considered a modifiable risk factor in intensive care unit patients; however, reported mechanisms are often lacking. This focused review will specifically evaluate the effects of steroids on sleep deprivation, psychosis, delirium, and what is known about these effects in a critically ill population. OBSERVATIONS: The medical literature proposes 3 pathways primarily responsible for neurocognitive AEs of steroids: behavior changes through modification of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, changes in natural sleep-wake cycles, and hyperarousal caused by modification in neuroinhibitory pathways. Initial search fields produced 285 articles. Case reports, reviews, letters, and articles pertaining to primary care or palliative populations were excluded, leaving 8 relevant articles for inclusion. CONCLUSIONS: Although steroid therapy often cannot be altered in the critically ill population, research showed that steroid overuse is common in intensive care units. Minimizing dosage and duration are important ways clinicians can mitigate AEs.
