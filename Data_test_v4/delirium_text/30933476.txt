30933476|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of neurodegenerative amyloid disorder causing progressive cognitive decline and memory loss. A considerable number of therapies for AD rely on inhibition/delay/dissociation of amyloid beta (Abeta) oligomers and fibrils. In this case, nanoparticles (NPs) demonstrated substantial effects on the Abeta fibrillation process; however, their effects on progressive cognitive decline and memory have been poorly investigated in vivo. In this study, acquisition and retention of spatial learning and memory are studied in a rat animal model of AD after intrahippocampal (IH) and intraperitoneal (IP) injections of a model NP, i.e., gold NPs (AuNPs). The outcomes revealed that the AuNPs could improve the acquisition and retention of spatial learning and memory in Abeta treated rats as indicated by decreased time (Abeta: 39.60 +- 3.23 s vs Abeta+AuNPs: 25.78 +- 2.80 s) and distance (Abeta: 917.98 +- 50.81 cm vs Abeta+AuNPs: 589.09 +- 65.96 cm) of finding the hidden platform during training days and by increased time spent in the target quadrant (Abeta: 19.40 +- 0.98 s vs Abeta+AuNPs: 29.36 +- 1.14 s) in the probe test in Morris water maze (MWM). Expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, BDNF, cAMP response element binding protein, CREB, and stromal interaction molecules, e.g., STIM1 and STIM2 was also increased, supporting improved neural survival. Our outcomes may pave a way for mechanistic insights toward the role of NPs on retrieval of the deteriorated behavioral functions in brain tissue after AD outbreak.
