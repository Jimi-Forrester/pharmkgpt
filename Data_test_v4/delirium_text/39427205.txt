39427205|t|Computational approaches to investigate the relationship between periodontitis and cardiovascular diseases for precision medicine.
39427205|a|Periodontitis is a highly prevalent inflammatory illness that leads to the destruction of tooth supporting tissue structures and has been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Precision medicine, an emerging branch of medical treatment, aims can further improve current traditional treatment by personalizing care based on one's environment, genetic makeup, and lifestyle. Genomic databases have paved the way for precision medicine by elucidating the pathophysiology of complex, heritable diseases. Therefore, the investigation of novel periodontitis-linked genes associated with CVD will enhance our understanding of their linkage and related biochemical pathways for targeted therapies. In this article, we highlight possible mechanisms of actions connecting PD and CVD. Furthermore, we delve deeper into certain heritable inflammatory-associated pathways linking the two. The goal is to gather, compare, and assess high-quality scientific literature alongside genomic datasets that seek to establish a link between periodontitis and CVD. The scope is focused on the most up to date and authentic literature published within the last 10 years, indexed and available from PubMed Central, that analyzes periodontitis-associated genes linked to CVD. Based on the comparative analysis criteria, fifty-one genes associated with both periodontitis and CVD were identified and reported. The prevalence of genes associated with both CVD and periodontitis warrants investigation to assess the validity of a potential linkage between the pathophysiology of both diseases.
