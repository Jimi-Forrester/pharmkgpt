39638097|a|Alzheimer's disease, a progressive neurodegenerative pathology, is characterized by the accumulation of Amyloid-beta plaques in the brain. Lecanemab (BAN2401), a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody, binds with high affinity to Amyloid-beta protofibrils. It is the first monoclonal antibody for Alzheimer's disease to receive full FDA approval. This systematic review, conducted with meticulous care, examines the current use and safety of Lecanemab in treating Alzheimer's disease. We screened literature from databases such as PubMed Central, PubMed (MedLine), ScienceDirect, Scopus, Web of Science, and Wolters Kluwer for randomized controlled trials testing Lecanemab for cognitive decline in patients with mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease. Outcomes measured included CDR-SB, ADCOMS, ADAS-Cog, and Amyloid burden on PET in centiloids. Likewise, reports were analyzed for adverse events associated with ARIA-A and ARIA-H. Five papers were included in the systematic review and three in the meta-analysis. The meta-analysis showed that Lecanemab slowed the progression of cognitive impairment as measured by CDR-SB, ADCOMS, and ADASCog, and significantly reduced Amyloid burden on PET in centiloids. However, Lecanemab was associated with an increased risk of ARIA-E and ARIA-H. Lecanemab has demonstrated efficacy in slowing cognitive impairment progression in Alzheimer's disease as measured by ADCOMS, ADAS-Cog, and CDR-SB. However, it is associated with an increased risk of ARIA-E and ARIA-H, particularly in ApoE4 carriers.
