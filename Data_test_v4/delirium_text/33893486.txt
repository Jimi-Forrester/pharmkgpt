33893486|t|Medium-Term Outcomes in Severely to Critically Ill Patients With Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Infection.
33893486|a|BACKGROUND: The medium- and long-term effects of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection on survivors are unknown. In the current study, we assessed the medium-term effects of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on survivors of severe disease. METHODS: This is a retrospective, case series of 200 patients hospitalized across 3 large Birmingham hospitals with severe-to-critical COVID-19 infection 4-7 months from disease onset. Patients underwent comprehensive clinical, laboratory, imaging, lung function tests (LFTs), and quality of life and cognitive assessments. RESULTS: At 4-7 months after disease onset, 63.2% of patients reported persistent breathlessness; 53.5%, significant fatigue; 37.5%, reduced mobility; and 36.8% pain. Serum markers of inflammation and organ injuries that persisted at hospital discharge had normalized on follow-up, indicating no sustained immune response causing chronic maladaptive inflammation. Chest radiographs showed complete resolution in 82.8%, and significant improvement or no change in 17.2%. LFTs revealed gas transfer abnormalities in 80.0% and abnormal spirometric values in 37.6% of patients. Compared with patients who did not experience breathlessness, those who did had significantly higher incidences of comorbid conditions and residual chest radiographic and LFT abnormalities (P < .01 to all). For all parameters assessed and persisting symptoms there were no significant differences between patients in hospital wards and those in intensive treatment units. All patients reported a significantly reduced quality of life in all domains of the EQ-5D-5L quality-of-life measures. CONCLUSIONS: A significant proportion of severely ill patients with COVID-19 still experience symptoms of breathlessness, fatigue, pain, reduced mobility, depression and reduced quality of life 4-7 months after disease onset. Symptomatic patients tend to have more residual chest radiographic and LFT abnormalities.
