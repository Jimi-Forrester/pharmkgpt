34555996|a|BACKGROUND AND AIM: The fruit of Garcinia is a rich and valuable source of bioactive compounds and is traditionally used for treating wounds and ulcers. The present study was carried out to investigate the protective effect of chromatographically standardized fruit extract of Garcinia cowa (GCE) on ethanol-induced gastric lesions in rats and its possible mechanisms. METHODS: The effect of GCE (200 and 400 mg/kg body weight) was evaluated by determining various gastric ulcer parameters like gastric wall mucus, non-protein sulfhydryls (NP-SH) content, microvascular permeability, endogenous antioxidant enzyme, and gastric histopathological study. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Oral administration of GCE at doses of 200 and 400 mg/kg exhibited significant (p < .01) dose-dependent inhibition of ulcer index by 18.94-44.02%, respectively. Pre-treatment of rats with GCE (400 mg/kg) significantly restored the depleted gastric wall mucus level by 34.09% and NP-SH content by 33.35% induced by ethanol administration. In addition, GCE (400 mg/kg) showed a significant decrease in microvascular permeability of Evans Blue by 47.43%, rationalizing its protective effect. Furthermore, a significant increase in oxidative enzyme levels with reduction in malondialdehyde level and elevation of superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was observed in the GCE treated group as compared to the ulcer control group. The histopathological assessment also confirmed the protective nature of GCE. HPTLC analysis showed the presence of 0.27%, 0.11% w/w gallic acid, and amentoflavone, respectively in GCE. The content of alpha-mangostin and xanthochymol in the G. cowa extract sample quantified by HPLC-PDA method was 0.72 and 8.46%, respectively. The results obtained indicate that the protective effect of GCE against gastric ulcers in rats through multiple actions confirmed by the reduction of oxidative stress and restoration of adhered gastric mucus, NP-SH content, and histological architecture.KEY MESSAGESEthanol is the most typical ulcerogenic agent and has been shown to extend the risk of ulcer in humans.Natural products are promising alternative medication for the development of new drugs to regulate gastrointestinal diseases.Garcinia cowa protects the gastric mucosa through multiple actions that include restoration of adhered gastric mucus and inhibition of lipid peroxidation.
