36982040|t|Possible Sources of Trace Metals in Obese Females Living in Informal Settlements near Industrial Sites around Gauteng, South Africa.
36982040|a|Trace metals have been reported in the literature to be associated with obesity. Exposure to some trace metals such as Mn, Cr, Ni, Cd, and Pb may pose a serious health risk to individuals living around a polluted environment. The present study assessed the levels of trace metals in the blood of obese females living around industrial areas in Gauteng, South Africa. The study was carried out using a mixed method approach. Only females with a BMI >= 30.0 were considered. A total of 120 obese females participated in the study (site 1: 40-industrial area, site 2: 40-industrial area, and site 3: 40-residential area), aged 18-45 and not in menopause. Blood samples were analysed for trace metals content using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The mean concentrations of trace metals were in the order Pb > Mn > Cr > Co > As > Cd (site 1), Pb > Mn > Co > As > Cd (site 2), and Mn > Cr > Co > As > Pb > Cd (site 3). The blood Mn from site 1 ranged from 6.79 microg/L-33.99 microg/L, and the mean differences obtained from the participants from different sites were significant (p < 0.01). The blood levels of Mn, Pb, Cr, Co, As, and Cd were above the recommended limits set by the WHO in some of the participants. The present study noted, among others, closeness to industrial areas, lifestyle decisions such as the use of tobacco products by their partners indoors, and the method used for cooking as factors that might have accounted for the blood levels of Mn, Pb, Cd and Co. The study showed that there is a need for constant monitoring of the levels of trace metals in the blood of those living in these areas.
