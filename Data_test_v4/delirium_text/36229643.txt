36229643|t|Alzheimer's disease large-scale gene expression portrait identifies exercise as the top theoretical treatment.
36229643|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder that affects multiple brain regions and is difficult to treat. In this study we used 22 AD large-scale gene expression datasets to identify a consistent underlying portrait of AD gene expression across multiple brain regions. Then we used the portrait as a platform for identifying treatments that could reverse AD dysregulated expression patterns. Enrichment of dysregulated AD genes included multiple processes, ranging from cell adhesion to CNS development. The three most dysregulated genes in the AD portrait were the inositol trisphosphate kinase, ITPKB (upregulated), the astrocyte specific intermediate filament protein, GFAP (upregulated), and the rho GTPase, RHOQ (upregulated). 41 of the top AD dysregulated genes were also identified in a recent human AD GWAS study, including PNOC, C4B, and BCL11A. 42 transcription factors were identified that were both dysregulated in AD and that in turn affect expression of other AD dysregulated genes. Male and female AD portraits were highly congruent. Out of over 250 treatments, three datasets for exercise or activity were identified as the top three theoretical treatments for AD via reversal of large-scale gene expression patterns. Exercise reversed expression patterns of hundreds of AD genes across multiple categories, including cytoskeleton, blood vessel development, mitochondrion, and interferon-stimulated related genes. Exercise also ranked as the best treatment across a majority of individual region-specific AD datasets and meta-analysis AD datasets. Fluoxetine also scored well and a theoretical combination of fluoxetine and exercise reversed 549 AD genes. Other positive treatments included curcumin. Comparisons of the AD portrait to a recent depression portrait revealed a high congruence of downregulated genes in both. Together, the AD portrait provides a new platform for understanding AD and identifying potential treatments for AD.
