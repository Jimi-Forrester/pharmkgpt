METHODS: The expression profile dataset GSE26475 was downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus database. A total of 21 samples were available, including knee joint samples from OA mice induced by DMM (Destabilization of the medial meniscus) surgery (6h, 3d, 7d), mice undergoing sham (only capsulotomy) surgery (6h, 3d, 7d) and the age matched Naive mice (normal controls) that were not operated on. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified and the KEGG pathway enrichment analysis was conducted for all DEGs. RESULTS: The number of DEGs between the DMM-induced mice at different times after surgery and normal controls was different that it decreased from 6h to 3d while increased at 7d. The same was true for the change of the number of DEGs between DMM and sham groups. Further analysis revealed that the DEGs between DMM and normal controls were mainly involved in the signaling and inflammation related pathways. Total 16 DEGs between DMM and sham groups at 7d were all involved in the Parkinson's disease, Oxidative phosphorylation and Alzheimer's disease pathways. CONCLUSION: The results presented here may help us to understand the molecular mechanism of OA.
