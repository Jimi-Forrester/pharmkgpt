37954033|t|A Prospective Cohort Study of Inter-Alpha-Trypsin Inhibitor Heavy Chain 4 as a Serologic Marker in Relation to Severity and Functional Outcome of Acute Intracerebral Hemorrhage.
37954033|a|Background: The inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain 4 (ITIH4) may regulate immunity and inflammation. The current study was conducted to determine its role as a biomarker for reflecting the severity and predicting outcomes of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Methods: In this prospective cohort study, 185 patients with supratentorial ICH were enrolled, among whom 62 had blood obtained not only at admission but also on days 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, and 14. In addition, 62 healthy controls underwent blood collection at the start of the study. The serum ITIH4 levels were then quantified. We recorded early neurological deterioration (END) and poor prognosis (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] scores of 3-6]) six months after ICH. Results: Serum ITIH4 levels decreased prominently in the early phase after ICH, continued to decline until day 5, then gradually increased until day 14, and were significantly lower during 14 days in patients than in controls. Serum ITIH4 levels on admission were independently associated with serum C-reactive protein levels, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores and hematoma volume. Admission serum ITIH4 levels were independently associated with mRS scores, END, and poor prognosis. No substantial differences existed in the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of END and poor prognosis prediction between the serum ITIH4 levels, NIHSS scores, and hematoma volume. Prediction models, in which serum ITIH4 levels, NIHSS scores, and hematoma volume were integrated, were relatively reliable and stable using a series of statistical methods. In addition, the prediction model of poor prognosis had a higher discriminatory ability than the NIHSS scores and hematoma volume alone. Conclusion: A dramatic decline in serum ITIH4 levels during the early period following ICH is independently related to the inflammatory response, stroke severity, and poor neurologic outcomes, suggesting that serum ITIH4 may be a useful prognostic biomarker of ICH.
