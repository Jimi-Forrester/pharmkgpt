9682942|t|Increased tau protein level in postmortem cerebrospinal fluid.
9682942|a|Microtubule-associated protein tau has been reported to be significantly increased in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of the patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), which suggests that it is possibly a biological marker for the diagnosis of AD. The underlying mechanism of the increased tau level in CSF, however, is not known. In this study, the tau levels were compared between antemortem and postmortem CSF. The postmortem tau levels in CSF were significantly increased in all groups including AD, neurological control, and nondemented control. A striking elevation of CSF tau was observed during the postmortem change with the nondemented subjects. These findings may offer some insight into the understanding of the mechanism of the increased tau level in CSF with AD and other related disorders.
