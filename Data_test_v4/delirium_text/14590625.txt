14590625|a|Recent health care sector changes have created a need for shorter, more focused neuropsychological assessments. The WAIS-R provides useful information on patients' general cognitive abilities, but poses problems in that it is time-consuming and may contribute to fatigue, especially among geriatric patients with dementia. This study evaluated Ward's (1990) 7-subtest version of the WAIS-R among 32 patients with presumptive Alzheimer's disease. Among all patients, the abbreviated test underestimated full WAIS-R scores by an average of 2.0, 0.2, and 1.8 points for the Verbal Intelligence Quotient (VIQ), Performance Intelligent Quotient (PIQ), and Full-Scale Intelligence Quotient (FSIQ). This general finding held true regardless of whether scores were generated using the standard WAIS-R method (for patients age 75 and younger) or using age corrections (i.e., Mayo Older Americans' Normative Studies [MOANS]) for older patients. Most patients scored within the mean standard errors of measurement defined in the WAIS-R manual for VIQ, PIQ, and FSIQ. In general, the 7-subtest and full versions of the WAIS-R yielded similar findings among this closely screened sample, but further testing among a more typical sample of patients with multiple risk factors for dementing conditions is needed.
