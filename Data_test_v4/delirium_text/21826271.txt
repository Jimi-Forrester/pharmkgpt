21826271|a|Procyanidins (PCs) are major components of the apple polyphenols (APs). We previously reported that treatment with PC extended the mean lifespan of Caenorhabditis elegans (Sunagawa et al., 2011). In order to estimate the neuroprotective effects of PC, we investigated the antiaggregative activity of PC on amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) aggregation, which is a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. We herein report that PC significantly suppressed Abeta42 aggregation and dissociated Abeta42 aggregates in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that PC is a potent suppressor of Abeta aggregation. Furthermore, PC significantly inhibited Abeta42 neurotoxicity and stimulated proliferation in PC-12 cells. These results suggested that the PC and AP acted as neuroprotective factors against toxic Abeta aggregates.
