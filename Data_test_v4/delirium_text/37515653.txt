37515653|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major neurological disease affecting elderly individuals worldwide. Existing drugs only reduce the symptoms of the disease without addressing the underlying causes. Commonly, Abeta25-35 peptide aggregation is the main reason for AD development. Recently, the discovery of multiple protein-targeting molecules has provided a new strategy for treating AD. This study demonstrates the neuroprotective potential of oxymatrine against multiple mechanisms, such as acetylcholinesterase, mitochondrial damage, and beta-amyloid-induced cell toxicity. The in vitro cell culture studies showed that oxymatrine possesses significant potential to inhibit acetylcholine esterase and promotes antioxidant, antiapoptotic effects while preventing Abeta25-35 peptide aggregation in PC12 cells. Furthermore, oxymatrine protects PC12 cells against Abeta25-35-induced cytotoxicity and down-regulates the reactive oxygen species generation. The in vivo acute toxicological studies confirm the safety of oxymatrine without causing organ damage or death in animals. Overall, this study provided evidence that oxymatrine is an efficient neuroprotective agent, with a potential to be a multifunctional drug for Alzheimer's disease treatment. These findings present a reliable and synergistic approach for treating AD.
