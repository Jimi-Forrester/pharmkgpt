35473418|t|Mediators of cognitive impairment in cerebral amyloid angiopathy.
35473418|a|BACKGROUND: Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is associated with cognitive decline. CAA has diverse impacts on brain structure and function; however, the brain lesions that mediate the association of CAA with cognition are not understood well. AIMS: To determine the degree to which CAA neuroimaging biomarkers mediate the association of CAA with cognitive dysfunction. METHODS: We analyzed cross-sectional data of patients with probable CAA and controls without cognitive impairment from the Functional Assessment of Vascular Reactivity study. Neuropsychological tests were grouped into domains of memory, executive function, and processing speed. Candidate CAA neuroimaging biomarkers were pre-specified based on prior literature, consisting of white matter hyperintensity volume, peak width of skeletonized mean diffusivity (PSMD) on diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR), cortical thickness, and cortical thickness in a meta-region of interest typically affected by Alzheimer's disease (AD). Cognitive scores and neuroimaging markers were standardized and reported in relation to values in controls. Mediation analysis was used to estimate the total effect of CAA on cognition and the proportion of the total effect that was mediated by neuroimaging biomarkers, controlling for age, sex, and education. RESULTS: There were 131 participants (67 CAA and 64 controls). Mean age was 72.1 +- 7.7 years, and 54.2% were women. As expected, compared to controls, CAA was associated with lower cognition. In mediation analyses, CAA had direct unmediated effects of 48%, 46%, and 52% on all three cognitive domains. The association of CAA with memory was partially mediated by CVR and PSMD, accounting for 18% and 36% of the total effect of CAA. The association of CAA with executive function was partially mediated by PSMD and mean cortical thickness in the AD meta-region of interest (ROI), accounting for 33% and 31% of the total effect of CAA. The association of CAA with processing speed was partially mediated by CVR and PSMD, accounting for 8% and 34% of the total effect of CAA. Among CAA participants, the presence of cortical superficial siderosis was associated with lower processing speed. CONCLUSION: Altered white matter diffusivity (i.e. PSMD), CVR, and atrophy, taken together, account for about half the effect of CAA on cognition.
