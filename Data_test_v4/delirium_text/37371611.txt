37371611|t|Probenecid, an Old Drug with Potential New Uses for Central Nervous System Disorders and Neuroinflammation.
37371611|a|Probenecid is an old uricosuric agent used in clinics to treat gout and reduce the renal excretion of antibiotics. In recent years, probenecid has gained attention due to its ability to interact with membrane proteins such as TRPV2 channels, organic anion transporters, and pannexin 1 hemichannels, which suggests new potential therapeutic utilities in medicine. Some current functions of probenecid include their use as an adjuvant to increase the bioavailability of several drugs in the Central Nervous System (CNS). Numerous studies also suggest that this drug has important neuroprotective, antiepileptic, and anti-inflammatory properties, as evidenced by their effect against neurological and neurodegenerative diseases. In these studies, the use of probenecid as a Panx1 hemichannel blocker to reduce neuroinflammation is highlighted since neuroinflammation is a major trigger for diverse CNS alterations. Although the clinical use of probenecid has declined over the years, advances in its use in preclinical research indicate that it may be useful to improve conventional therapies in the psychiatric field where the drugs used have a low bioavailability, either because of a deficient passage through the blood-brain barrier or a high efflux from the CNS or also a high urinary clearance. This review summarizes the history, pharmacological properties, and recent research uses of probenecid and discusses its future projections as a potential pharmacological strategy to intervene in neurodegeneration as an outcome of neuroinflammation.
