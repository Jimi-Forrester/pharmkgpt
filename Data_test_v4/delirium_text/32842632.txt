32842632|t|Electrochemical Biosensors Based on Nanomaterials for Early Detection of Alzheimer's Disease.
32842632|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an untreatable neurodegenerative disease that initially manifests as difficulty to remember recent events and gradually progresses to cognitive impairment. The incidence of AD is growing yearly as life expectancy increases, thus early detection is essential to ensure a better quality of life for diagnosed patients. To reach that purpose, electrochemical biosensing has emerged as a cost-effective alternative to traditional diagnostic techniques, due to its high sensitivity and selectivity. Of special relevance is the incorporation of nanomaterials in biosensors, as they contribute to enhance electron transfer while promoting the immobilization of biological recognition elements. Moreover, nanomaterials have also been employed as labels, due to their unique electroactive and electrocatalytic properties. The aim of this review is to add value in the advances achieved in the detection of AD biomarkers, the strategies followed for the incorporation of nanomaterials and its effect in biosensors performance.
