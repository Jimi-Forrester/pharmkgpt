37850607|a|BACKGROUND: Systemic lupus erythematosus is a prevalent autoimmune disease that affects multiples systems, exerting its most incapacitating and life-threatening impact through neuropsychiatric involvement. According to the American College of Rheumatology (ACR), 19 neuropsychiatric syndromes types of SLE are classified into categories encompassing the central and peripheral nervous systems. This study aimed to investigate the frequency of neuropsychiatric manifestations in systemic lupus erythematosus patients admitted to Hospital Cayetano Heredia in Lima, Peru, between 2008 and 2019. METHODS: A retrospective observational study was conducted, entailing the review of 240 medical records of patients diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus during the specified period, based on the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC) 2012 criteria. Among these records, 55 patients presented neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus (NPSLE). Data were collected using standardized form and entered into Microsoft Excel 2019 database. Statistical analysis was performed using Stata v16. RESULTS: The frequency of neuropsychiatric compromise in systemic lupus erythematosus patients was found to be 22.91%. Among the 55 systemic lupus erythematosus patients, 40 demonstrated involvement of the central nervous system (72.72%), 2 exhibited involvement of the peripheral nervous system (3.63%), and 13 displayed involvement in both the central nervous system and peripheral nervous system (23.63%). The most prevalent psychiatric disorder observed was a major depressive disorder, with a prevalence rate of 30.9%. CONCLUSION: The study revealed a frequency of 22.91% for neuropsychiatric involvement in systemic lupus erythematosuspatients at Cayetano Heredia Hospital between 2008 and 2019, with central nervous system manifestations prevailing. Furthermore, the findings suggest that NPSLE commonly manifested after the diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus.
