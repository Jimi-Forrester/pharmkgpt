29163753|a|Citicoline and homotaurine are renowned compounds that exhibit potent neuroprotective activities through distinct molecular mechanisms. The present study was undertaken to demonstrate whether cotreatment with citicoline and homotaurine affects cell survival in primary retinal cultures under experimental conditions simulating retinal neurodegeneration. Primary cultures were obtained from the retina of fetal rats and exposed to citicoline plus homotaurine (100 muM). Subsequently, neurotoxicity was induced using excitotoxic levels of glutamate and high glucose concentrations. The effects on retinal cultures were assessed by cell viability and immunodetection of apoptotic oligonucleosomes. The results showed that a combination of citicoline and homotaurine synergistically decreases proapoptotic effects associated with glutamate- and high glucose-treated retinal cultures. This study provides an insight into the potential application of citicoline and homotaurine as a valuable tool to exert neuroprotective effects against retinal damage.
