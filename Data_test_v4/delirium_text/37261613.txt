37261613|t|SARS-CoV-2 and the nervous system: current perspectives.
37261613|a|SARS-CoV-2 infection frequently causes neurological impairment in both adults and children. Recent publications have described significant aspects of the viral pathophysiology associated with neurological dysfunction. In theory, neurological manifestations following SARS-CoV-2 infection may be caused directly by the effects of the virus infecting the brain or indirectly by the local and systemic immune responses against the virus. Neurological manifestations can occur during the acute phase as well as in the post-acute phase of the infection. In this review, we discuss recent literature describing the association of nervous system disorders with COVID-19.
