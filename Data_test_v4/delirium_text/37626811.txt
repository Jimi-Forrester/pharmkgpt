37626811|t|Non-Surgical Treatments of Trigeminal Neuralgia from the Perspective of a Pain Physician: A Narrative Review.
37626811|a|Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is a unilateral disorder characterized by electric shock-like pain, abrupt onset and termination, and limited to one or more branches of the trigeminal nerve. Various therapeutic modalities for TN have been introduced. We searched for literature indexed in PubMed, Medline, and the National Library of Medicine and reviewed all relevant articles on non-surgical treatments for TN. Published studies were reviewed with no restrictions on date; reviews, clinical trials, animal studies, retrospective studies, and cases were included. Carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine are the recommended first-line pharmacotherapies. Interventional treatments should be considered when pharmacotherapy is insufficient or withdrawn because of adverse effects.
