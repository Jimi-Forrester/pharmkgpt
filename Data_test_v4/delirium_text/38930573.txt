38930573|a|Sulforaphane (SFN) is a natural isothiocyanate derived from cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and cabbage. SFN plays a crucial role in maintaining redox homeostasis by interacting with the active cysteine residues of Keap1, leading to the dissociation and activation of NRF2 in various diseases. In this study, our objective was to investigate the impact of SFN on oxidative stress and pyroptosis in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb)-infected macrophages. Our findings demonstrated that Mtb infection significantly increased the production of iNOS and ROS, indicating the induction of oxidative stress in macrophages. However, treatment with SFN effectively suppressed the expression of iNOS and COX-2 and reduced MDA and ROS levels, while enhancing GSH content as well as upregulating NRF2, HO-1, and NQO-1 expression in Mtb-infected RAW264.7 macrophages and primary peritoneal macrophages from WT mice. These results suggest that SFN mitigates oxidative stress by activating the NRF2 signaling pathway in Mtb-infected macrophages. Furthermore, excessive ROS production activates the NLRP3 signaling pathway, thereby promoting pyroptosis onset. Further investigations revealed that SFN effectively suppressed the expression of NLRP3, Caspase-1, and GSDMD, IL-1beta, and IL-18 levels, as well as the production of LDH, suggesting that it may exhibit anti-pyroptotic effects through activation of the NRF2 signaling pathway and reductions in ROS production during Mtb infection. Moreover, we observed that SFN also inhibited the expression of NLRP3, ASC, Caspase1, and IL-1beta along with LDH production in Mtb-infected primary peritoneal macrophages from NFR2-/- mice. This indicates that SFN can directly suppress NLRP3 activation and possibly inhibit pyroptosis initiation in an NRF2-independent manner. In summary, our findings demonstrate that SFN exerts its inhibitory effects on oxidative stress by activating the NRF2 signaling pathway in Mtb-infected macrophages, while it may simultaneously exert anti-pyroptotic properties through both NRF2-dependent and independent mechanisms targeting the NLRP3 signaling pathway.
