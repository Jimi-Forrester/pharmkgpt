31041250|t|An audit of cerebral venous thrombosis associated with pregnancy and puerperium in teaching hospital in North Eastern India.
31041250|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) is characterized by its clinical pleomorphism and pathogenetic variability. We studied 87 patients with CVT associated with pregnancy, and puerperium to find clinical profile, neuroradiological presentation and prognosis. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted based on clinical records at our institute between June 2008 and June 2018 without any personally identifying information. The diagnosis of CVT was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging, angiography, or neuropathological study. RESULTS: Among 87 patients, there were 82 of CVT associated with puerperium and 5 during pregnancy. Fifty-five women were multiparous. Cesarean delivery, hypertension, and anemia were strongly and significantly associated with CVT. Final outcome was considered good with anticoagulation; mortality rate was 10.34%. CONCLUSION: CVT associated with pregnancy, and puerperium is not an uncommon entity and has acute onset and a better prognosis. Pregnancy-related hypertension and Cesarean delivery and anemia are important risk factors for CVT. Further studies are needed to evaluate the need for therapeutic strategies for patients with CVT during pregnancy and puerperium.
