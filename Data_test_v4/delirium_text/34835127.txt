34835127|a|Reducing the socioeconomic toll from age-related physical and mental morbidities requires better understanding of factors affecting healthy aging. While many environmental, lifestyle, and genetic factors affect healthy aging, this study addressed the influence of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and immunity on age-related inflammation and cognitive abilities. Healthy adults 70-90 years old were recruited into a prospective study investigating relationships between anti-CMV immunity, markers of inflammation, baseline measures of cognitive ability, and changes in cognitive ability over 18 months. Humoral and cellular responses against CMV, levels of inflammatory markers, and cognitive abilities were measured at study entry, with measurement of cognitive abilities repeated 18 months later. CMV-seropositive and -seronegative sub-groups were compared, and relationships between anti-CMV immunity, markers of inflammation, and cognitive ability were assessed. Twenty-eight of 39 participants were CMV-seropositive, and two had CMV-specific CD8+ T cell responses indicative of CMV immune memory inflation. No significant differences for markers of inflammation or measures of cognitive ability were observed between groups, and cognitive scores changed little over 18 months. Significant correlations between markers of inflammation and cognitive scores with interconnection between anti-CMV antibody levels, fractalkine, cognitive ability, and depression scores suggest areas of focus for future studies.
