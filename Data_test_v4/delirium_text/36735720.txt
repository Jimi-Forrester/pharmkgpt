36735720|t|Genetic scores for predicting longevity in the Croatian oldest-old population.
36735720|a|Longevity is a hallmark of successful ageing and a complex trait with a significant genetic component. In this study, 43 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were chosen from the literature and genotyped in a Croatian oldest-old sample (85+ years, sample size (N) = 314), in order to determine whether any of these SNPs have a significant effect on reaching the age thresholds for longevity (90+ years, N = 212) and extreme longevity (95+ years, N = 84). The best models were selected for both survival ages using multivariate logistic regression. In the model for reaching age 90, nine SNPs explained 20% of variance for survival to that age, while the 95-year model included five SNPs accounting for 9.3% of variance. The two SNPs that showed the most significant association (p <= 0.01) with longevity were TERC rs16847897 and GHRHR rs2267723. Unweighted and weighted Genetic Longevity Scores (uGLS and wGLS) were calculated and their predictive power was tested. All four scores showed significant correlation with age at death (p <= 0.01). They also passed the ROC curve test with at least 50% predictive ability, but wGLS90 stood out as the most accurate score, with a 69% chance of accurately predicting survival to the age of 90.
