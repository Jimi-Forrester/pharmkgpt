35039243|a|OBJECTIVES: COVID-19 was declared pandemic by March 2020. Clinical, analytical, and radiological findings have been reported. Detailed different evolution of patients of the same local outbreak has been scarcely reported. We report 6 selected cases of such an evolution. CLINICAL CASES: The clinical, radiological, analytical evolution of 6 patients is reported. Patients were selected as it were epidemiological close contacts, and showed particular different clinical evolution. RESULTS: The clinical course at the start of infection (first week) was similar among patients. In relationship with clinical evolution, middle to severe course were related with inflammation markers levels evolution (D-dimer, IL-6, ferritin, lymphocytes count, etc.). Specially lung alterations were observed, but neurological/neuropsychiatric findings are still common. In evolution, 2 patients showed middle symptoms, but the 2 most severely affected died. CONCLUSIONS: It remains to be elucidated the different evolutive pathways and outcomes of COVD-19. In our 6 patients of the same local outbreak, clinical, laboratory and radiological features were different. We discuss some aspects of the pathophysiology of the disease, other than the widely described of the respiratory system.
