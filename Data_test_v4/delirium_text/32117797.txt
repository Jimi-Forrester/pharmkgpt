32117797|t|Interaction of Oral and Toothbrush Microbiota Affects Oral Cavity Health.
32117797|a|Tooth brushing is necessary to maintain oral health. Little research has been carried out to explore microbial diversity in toothbrushes and to study the potential impact of these bacteria on human health. In the present study, 20 participants were enrolled, and the microbial diversity in their oral cavity and toothbrushes was investigated using high-throughput sequencing. Our results indicate that 1,136 and 976 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were obtained from groups CB (samples from toothbrushes of participants using traditional Chinese medicinal toothpaste) and AB (samples from toothbrushes of those using antibacterial toothpaste), respectively. The pathogens Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, and Candida albicans were identified on toothbrushes. The presence of these pathogens increases the chance for the host to get infectious diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, cardiovascular diseases, and cancers. Moreover, our in vitro results indicate that traditional Chinese medicinal toothpaste and antibacterial toothpaste can not only inhibit the growth of pathogens but also markedly inhibit the growth of probiotics Lactobacillus salivarius and Streptococcus salivarius. Therefore, the inhibitory effect of toothpaste on probiotics, together with the existence of pathogens in toothbrushes, indicates a potential risk of tooth brushing for people in a sub-healthy state.
