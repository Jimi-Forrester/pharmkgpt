35887140|t|Conditioned Medium of Human Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Neural Precursor Cells Exerts Neurorestorative Effects against Ischemic Stroke Model.
35887140|a|Previous studies have shown that early therapeutic events of neural precursor cells (NPCs) transplantation to animals with acute ischemic stroke readily protected neuronal cell damage and improved behavioral recovery through paracrine mechanisms. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that administration of conditioned medium from NPCs (NPC-CMs) could recapitulate the beneficial effects of cell transplantation. Rats with permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO) were randomly assigned to one of the following groups: PBS control, Vehicle (medium) controls, single (NPC-CM(S)) or multiple injections of NPC-CM(NPC-CM(M)) groups. A single intravenous injection of NPC-CM exhibited strong neuroregenerative potential to induce behavioral recovery, and multiple injections enhanced this activity further by suppressing inflammatory damage and inducing endogenous neurogenesis leading to histopathological and functional recovery. Proteome analysis of NPC-CM identified a number of proteins that are known to be associated with nervous system development, neurogenesis, and angiogenesis. In addition, transcriptome analysis revealed the importance of the inflammatory response during stroke recovery and some of the key hub genes in the interaction network were validated. Thus, our findings demonstrated that NPC-CM promoted functional recovery and reduced cerebral infarct and inflammation with enhanced endogenous neurogenesis, and the results highlighted the potency of NPC-CM in stroke therapy.
