37692082|a|Early screening and detection of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is crucial due to the significantly low survival rate in advanced stages. Blood-based liquid biopsy is non-invasive test to assistant disease diagnosis, while cell-free RNA is one of the promising biomarkers in blood. However, the disease related signatures have not been explored completely for most cell-free RNA transcriptome sequencing (cfRNA-Seq) datasets. To address this gap, we developed a comprehensive cfRNA-Seq pipeline for data analysis and constructed a machine learning model to facilitate noninvasive early diagnosis of NSCLC. The results of our study have demonstrated the identification of differential mRNA, lncRNAs and miRNAs from cfRNA-Seq, which have exhibited significant association with development and progression of lung cancer. The classifier based on gene expression signatures achieved an impressive area under the curve (AUC) of up to 0.9, indicating high specificity and sensitivity in both cross-validation and independent test. Furthermore, the analysis of T cell and B cell immune repertoire extracted from cfRNA-Seq have provided insights into the immune status of cancer patients, while the microbiome analysis has revealed distinct bacterial and viral profiles between NSCLC and normal samples. In our future work, we aim to validate the existence of cancer associated T cell receptors (TCR)/B cell receptors (BCR) and microorganisms, and subsequently integrate all identified signatures into diagnostic model to improve the prediction accuracy. This study not only provided a comprehensive analysis pipeline for cfRNA-Seq dataset but also highlights the potential of cfRNAs as promising biomarkers and models for early NSCLC diagnosis, emphasizing their importance in clinical settings.
