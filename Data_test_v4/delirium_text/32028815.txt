32028815|t|Drivers of Long-Term Care Considerations by Persons With Cognitive Impairment.
32028815|a|Consideration of place of care is the first step in long-term care (LTC) planning and is critical for patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease; yet, drivers of consideration of place of care are unknown. We apply machine learning algorithms to cross-sectional data from the CARE-IDEAS (Caregivers' Reactions and Experience: Imaging Dementia-Evidence for Amyloid Scanning) study (n = 869 dyads) to identify drivers of patient consideration of institutional, in-home paid, and family care. Although decisions about LTC are complex, important drivers included whether patients consulted with a financial planner about LTC, patient demographics, loneliness, and geographical proximity of family members. Findings about consulting with a financial planner match literature showing that perceived financial constraints limit the range of choices in LTC planning. Well-documented drivers of institutionalization, such as care partner burden, were not identified as important variables. By understanding which factors drive patients to consider each type of care, clinicians can guide patients and their families in LTC planning.
