32756234|t|Sleep in Patients With Neurologic Disease.
32756234|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This article provides a discussion of the current evidence and contemporary views on the relationship between sleep disorders and neurologic disease. RECENT FINDINGS: Disrupted or disordered sleep can be associated with increased morbidity and mortality, the risk of cardiovascular events, increased seizure frequency, and altered immune responses. Studies have implicated disrupted sleep and circadian rhythm dysfunction with both amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposition and tau deposition. A bidirectional relationship exists between disrupted sleep and the progression of Alzheimer disease pathology. Insomnia has been reported as a prodromal symptom in autoimmune encephalitis. Primary sleep disorders have now been increasingly recognized as a common comorbid condition in multiple sclerosis, making it imperative that neurologists feel comfortable differentiating multiple sclerosis fatigue from excessive daytime sleepiness caused by primary sleep disorders to optimally treat their patients. SUMMARY: Sleep disorders are common across the population. By recognizing sleep disorders in patients with neurologic conditions, neurologists can provide comprehensive care and, in some cases, reduce neurologic disease burden.
