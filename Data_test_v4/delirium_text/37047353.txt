37047353|t|Sigma-2 Receptor Ligand Binding Modulates Association between TSPO and TMEM97.
37047353|a|Sigma-2 receptor (S2R) is a S2R ligand-binding site historically associated with reportedly 21.5 kDa proteins that have been linked to several diseases, such as cancer, Alzheimer's disease, and schizophrenia. The S2R is highly expressed in various tumors, where it correlates with the proliferative status of the malignant cells. Recently, S2R was reported to be the transmembrane protein TMEM97. Prior to that, we had been investigating the translocator protein (TSPO) as a potential 21.5 kDa S2R candidate protein with reported heme and sterol associations. Here, we investigate the contributions of TMEM97 and TSPO to S2R activity in MCF7 breast adenocarcinoma and MIA PaCa-2 (MP) pancreatic carcinoma cells. Additionally, the role of the reported S2R-interacting partner PGRMC1 was also elucidated. Proximity ligation assays and co-immunoprecipitation show a functional association between S2R and TSPO. Moreover, a close physical colocalization of TMEM97 and TSPO was found in MP cells. In MCF7 cells, co-immunoprecipitation only occurred with TMEM97 but not with PGRMC1, which was further confirmed by confocal microscopy experiments. Treatment with the TMEM97 ligand 20-(S)-hydroxycholesterol reduced co-immunoprecipitation of both TMEM97 and PGRMC1 in immune pellets of immunoprecipitated TSPO in MP cells. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first suggestion of a (functional) interaction between TSPO and TMEM97 that can be affected by S2R ligands.
