27110525|t|Prophylactic Effects of Doxapram, Ketamine and Meperidine in Postoperative Shivering.
27110525|a|BACKGROUND: Postanaesthetic shivering is one of the most common unpleasant complications in patients. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of doxapram, ketamine and meperidine in prevention of shivering after anaesthesia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind clinical trial, 120 patients aged between 20 - 45 years old under general anaesthesia were enrolled. The patients were randomly allocated into one of three groups: group M received 20 mg meperidine (n = 40), group K received 0.25 mg/kg ketamine (n = 40) and group D received 0.25 mg/kg doxapram (n = 40). All of the drugs were administered intravenously. The core temperature, shivering, time of the first postoperative analgesic requirement, and some of the other side effects were recorded. Obtained data from the three groups were compared using one-way ANOVA and chi-square test. RESULTS: Three patients (7.5%) of group K, four patients (10%) of group D and one patient (2.5%) of group M experienced shivering (P = 0.39). The interval to the first analgesic requirement significantly prolonged in the groups K and M compared to the group D (P < 0.001). No significant differences were identified in nausea and vomiting among the groups. No significant pharmaceutical adverse effects were observed in our study. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study showed that ketamine, doxapram and meperidine are equally effective in the prevention of postoperative shivering.
