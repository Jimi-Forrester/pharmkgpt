34204731|t|Candida albicans and Oral Carcinogenesis. A Brief Review.
34204731|a|Current medical knowledge and research on patients' management are still evolving, and several protocols on minimizing risk of infection by Candida spp. among the population have developed. The aim of this work is to review the epidemiological and biomolecular characteristics and the various histopathological carcinogenesis hypothesis mechanisms that can occur during Candida albicans infections. Current evidence from the literature on the role of C. albicans during potentially malignant oral disorders and oral cancer has been sought. Thus, these biomolecular processes can give or contribute to benign lesions, also in precancerous or cancerous situations. Alongside this, the physiological microorganism oral flora (microbiota) can play a crucial role in maintaining oral health during those infections and therefore avoid carcinogenesis.
