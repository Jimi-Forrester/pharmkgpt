32046518|t|In vitro study of the mechanism of intraneuronal beta-amyloid aggregation in Alzheimer's disease.
32046518|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is atrophy of brain cells that lead to decline in the mental capacity and memory. This study investigated the mechanism which postulates that intraneuronal accumulation of amyloid aggregates for pathogenesis of AD. The PC12 cell line was used to examine the amyloid beta (Abeta) aggregation in different stages. It was found that dot-blot filter retardation assay for Ub-CTF was 0.25 and 0.2 microM for SS-CTF. In addition, incubation of SS-CTF with 200 microM Abeta-42 then bounded with an antibody directed against Abeta. It was suggested that most bound Abeta-42 in the oligomeric form. Confocal microscope showed that stained with DAPI (blue) in the neuritic plaques, APP-GFP (green) and specific monoclonal M78 (red). Ass oligomeric taken up by neurons and accumulation of misfolded Ass aggregates continue in a perinuclear location. Fluorescence intensities correlate with the priming effect observed on the Abeta (p < .001). It was concluded that a new amyloid hypothesis is promising in therapy development to reduce the incidence of disease by inhibition of intraneuronal amyloid aggregation.
