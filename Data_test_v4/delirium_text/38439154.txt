38439154|a|Kaempferol, a flavonoid compound found in various fruits, vegetables, and medicinal plants, has garnered increasing attention due to its potential neuroprotective effects in neurological diseases. This research examines the existing literature concerning the involvement of kaempferol in neurological diseases, including stroke, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, neuroblastoma/glioblastoma, spinal cord injury, neuropathic pain, and epilepsy. Numerous in vitro and in vivo investigations have illustrated that kaempferol possesses antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiapoptotic properties, contributing to its neuroprotective effects. Kaempferol has been shown to modulate key signaling pathways involved in neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation, such as the PI3K/Akt, MAPK/ERK, and NF-kappaB pathways. Moreover, kaempferol exhibits potential therapeutic benefits by enhancing neuronal survival, attenuating oxidative stress, enhancing mitochondrial calcium channel activity, reducing neuroinflammation, promoting neurogenesis, and improving cognitive function. The evidence suggests that kaempferol holds promise as a natural compound for the prevention and treatment of neurological diseases. Further research is warranted to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of action, optimize dosage regimens, and evaluate the safety and efficacy of this intervention in human clinical trials, thereby contributing to the advancement of scientific knowledge in this field.
