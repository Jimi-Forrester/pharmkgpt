This study aimed to investigate the relationship between tooth loss and cognitive dysfunction and illustrate the role of neuroinflammation in advancing Alzheimer's disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Male 5-month-old senescence-accelerated mouse strain P8 (SAMP8) mice were divided into three groups (n = 7): the C (control), S (sham-operated), and TL (tooth loss) groups. The Morris water maze (MWM) test was performed to assess spatial memory. Additionally, histopathological and molecular assessments of hippocampal tissues were performed. RESULTS: The TL groups exhibited impaired spatial memory in the water maze. Tooth loss induced higher protein expression levels of the neuroinflammation cytokine interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) in the hippocampus than in the S and C groups. Tooth loss activated the NLRP3 inflammasome and increased the expression of Caspase-1 in the hippocampus. CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicated that tooth loss impairs cognitive function in SAMP8 mice and is closely related to the activation of NLRP3/Caspase-1 in the hippocampus.
