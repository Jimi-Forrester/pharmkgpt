35340676|t|Exploring the Role of Transglutaminase in Patients with Glioblastoma: Current Perspectives.
35340676|a|Tissue transglutaminase (tTG) is a rather unique GTP-binding/protein crosslinking enzyme that has been shown to play important roles in a number of cellular processes that impact both normal physiology and disease states. This is especially the case in the context of aggressive brain tumors, such as glioblastoma. The diverse roles played by tTG in cancer survival and progression have led to significant interest in recent years in using tTG as a therapeutic target. In this review, we provide a brief overview of the transglutaminase family, and then discuss the primary biochemical activities exhibited by tTG with an emphasis on the role it plays in glioblastoma progression. Finally, we consider current approaches to target tTG which might eventually have clinical impact.
