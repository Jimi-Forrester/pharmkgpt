24113653|t|Generation and characterization of a rabbit monoclonal antibody site-specific for tau O-GlcNAcylated at serine 400.
24113653|a|Aggregation of tau into paired helical filaments is a pathological process leading to neurotoxicity in Alzheimer's disease and other tauopathies. Tau is posttranslationally modified by O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc), and increasing tau O-GlcNAcylation may protect against its aggregation. Research tools to study the relationship between tau aggregation and tau O-GlcNAcylation have not been widely available. Here we describe the generation of a rabbit monoclonal antibody specific for tau O-GlcNAcylated at Ser400 (O-tau(S400)). We show the utility of this antibody for in vitro and in vivo experiments to investigate the function of O-GlcNAc modifications of tau at Ser400.
