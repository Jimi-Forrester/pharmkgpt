39880225|t|Amyloid capture and aggregation inhibition by human serum albumin.
39880225|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder characterized by amyloid-beta (Abeta) aggregation, primarily involving the peptides Abeta40 and Abeta42. Human serum albumin (HSA) has emerged as a potential therapeutic agent due to its ability to bind Abeta, inhibit aggregation, and promote disaggregation. This study quantitatively examined the interactions of HSA with both monomeric and aggregated forms of Abeta40 and Abeta42 using fluorescence techniques, including bulk steady-state fluorescence, fluorescence anisotropy, time-resolved fluorescence, and Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS). The binding constants determined from these methods were 4.45 x 104 M-1 for Abeta42 and 1.8 x 104M-1 for Abeta40, indicating strong but differential affinities. FCS demonstrated that HSA effectively dissociates Abeta aggregates, shifting the equilibrium toward monomeric states, with the disaggregation capacity positively correlated with HSA concentration. These findings support HSA's utility in therapies like plasma exchange to reduce the cerebral Abeta burden, providing critical insights into its mechanistic role and therapeutic potential.
