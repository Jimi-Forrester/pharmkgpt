A. sinensis optimal formula (AOF) is the best combination in A. sinensis that has been screened to rescue the cognitive ability in beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta25-35)-treated Alzheimer's disease (AD) rats. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of AOF on the learning and memory of AD rats as well as to explore the underlying mechanisms. METHODS: Male Wistar rats were infused with Abeta25-35 for AD model induction or saline (negative control). Five groups of AD rats were fed on AOF at 20, 40, or 80 mL/kg every day, donepezil at 0.9 mg/kg every day (positive control), or an equal volume of water (AD model) intragastrically once a day for 4 weeks, while the negative control rats were fed on water. The Morris water maze test was used to evaluate the cognitive function of the rats. The Abeta accumulation, cholinergic levels, and antioxidative ability were detected by ELISA. Additionally, the candidate mechanism was determined by gene sequencing and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: The results showed that AOF administration significantly ameliorated Abeta25-35-induced memory impairment. AOF decreased the levels of amyloid-beta precursor protein and Abeta in the hippocampus, rescued the cholinergic levels, increased the activity of superoxide dismutase, and decreased the malondialdehyde level. In addition, AOF inhibited the expression of IL1b, Mpo, and Prkcg in the hippocampus. CONCLUSION: These experimental findings illustrate that AOF prevents the decrease in cognitive function and Abeta deposits in Abeta25-35-treated rats via modulating neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, thus highlighting a potential therapeutic avenue to promote the co-administration of formulas that act on different nodes to maximize beneficial effects and minimize negative side effects.
