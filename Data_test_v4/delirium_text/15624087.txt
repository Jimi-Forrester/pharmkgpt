15624087|t|Validation of the Guidelines for the Diagnosis of Dementia and Alzheimer's Disease of the Italian Neurological Society. Study in 72 Italian neurological centres and 1549 patients.
15624087|a|The objective of this study was to verify the adherence of Italian family physicians and neurologists to the Guidelines on Diagnosis of Dementia of the Italian Society of Neurology. A multicentre survey was carried out, in 72 neurological centres. The centres included at least 15 consecutive subjects suspected of having a dementia. The adherence of family physicians to the guidelines was poor. Neurologists performed a complete neuropsychological evaluation in a minority of the cases. Patients who had a decrease of Mini Mental Status Examination scores after six months higher than or equal to 4 were more represented among those patients for whom one or more recommendations were not respected. In Italy the adherence to the Guidelines on Diagnosis of Dementia and AlzheimerValidation studys Disease of the Italian Society of Neurology is very poor for family physicians (GPs) and satisfactory, albeit improvable, on the part of neurologists. Respect for the guidelines might improve the outcome of patients with dementia.
