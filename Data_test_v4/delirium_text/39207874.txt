39207874|a|As the population ages, it is essential that professionals across disciplines have experience and competence working with older adults. Though experiential learning opportunities have been extensively documented as a tool to accomplish this goal, student engagement in gerontology research has not been examined in detail. This participatory case study highlights the perspectives of undergraduate student researchers involved in a hands-on pilot research study that explored connections between cognitive, physical, and everyday function in midlife and older adults while testing the feasibility of a mobile app for early detection of cognitive decline related to Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. As participants, students (n = 11) completed a survey about their experience and participated in focus groups. As researchers, students and faculty coded open-ended survey and focus group responses. We found that students gained both personal and professional skills from their experience. Emergent themes relevant to their experience included the overarching research lab environment and study-specific conditions related to interpersonal and technical aspects. Although these findings reflect student perspectives in one case, they can be used as a guide to support future endeavors to include undergraduate students as testers in gerontology research.
