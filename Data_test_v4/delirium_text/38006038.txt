38006038|t|Summary of the Current Status of DNA Vaccination for Alzheimer Disease.
38006038|a|Alzheimer disease (AD) is one of the most common and disabling neuropathies in the ever-growing aged population around the world, that especially affects Western countries. We are in urgent need of finding an effective therapy but also a valid prophylactic means of preventing AD. There is a growing attention currently paid to DNA vaccination, a technology particularly used during the COVID-19 era, which can be used also to potentially prevent or modify the course of neurological diseases, including AD. This paper aims to discuss the main features and hurdles encountered in the immunization and therapy against AD using DNA vaccine technology. Ultimately, this work aims to effectively promote the efforts in research for the development of safe and effective DNA and RNA vaccines for AD.
