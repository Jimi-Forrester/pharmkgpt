34285489|t|Abeta Influx into the Blood Evoked by Different Blood Abeta Removal Systems: A Potential Therapy for Alzheimer's Disease.
34285489|a|PURPOSE: Amyloid-beta (Abeta) is a brain protein that causes Alzheimer's disease. We have revealed that extracorporeal blood Abeta-removal systems evoked a large Abeta influx into the blood. This study investigated the system that is more effective in evoking Abeta influx. METHODS: Abeta removal activities were compared between hexadecyl-alkylated cellulose beads (HexDC) and fragments of polysulfone hollow fibers (PSf-HFs) in mini-columns to eliminate the filtration effect. Then, adsorptive filtration systems were adapted for PSf hemodialyzers to enhance Abeta adsorption on micropores in the wall of hollow fibers. Plasma Abeta concentrations of patients with renal failure were analyzed during treatment with PSf hemodialyzers alone for 8 h or tandemly connected HexDC and PSf hemodialyzers for 4 h. RESULTS: In the in vitro study, Abeta removal efficiency for HexDC was approximately 100% during the 60 min treatment, whereas the removal efficiency for PSf-HF fragments gradually decreased. However, PSf hemodialyzer in adsorptive filtration systems removed Abetas comparably or more than HexDC. Abeta influx into the blood increases time-dependently. Concomitant use of HexDC and PSf hemodialyzer evoked a larger Abeta1-40 influx than that of PSf hemodialyzer alone. However, Abeta1-42 influx by PSf hemodialyzer alone was similar to or a little larger than influx by the combined system. Both systems evoked almost doubled Abeta influx than estimated Abetas existing in the normal brain during the 4 h treatment. CONCLUSION: PSf hemodialyzer alone for a longer period and concomitant use of HexDC and PSf hemodialyzer for a shorter time effectively evoked a larger Abeta influx. To evoke Abeta1-42 influx, PSf hemodialyzer alone was effective enough. These findings of devices and treatment time may lead to optimal clinical settings for therapy and prevention of Alzheimer's disease.
