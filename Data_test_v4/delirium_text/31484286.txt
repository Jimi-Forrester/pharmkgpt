31484286|t|Genetic Factors of Cerebral Small Vessel Disease and Their Potential Clinical Outcome.
31484286|a|Cerebral small vessel diseases (SVD) have been causally correlated with ischemic strokes, leading to cognitive decline and vascular dementia. Neuroimaging and molecular genetic tests could improve diagnostic accuracy in patients with potential SVD. Several types of monogenic, hereditary cerebral SVD have been identified: cerebral autosomal recessive arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CARASIL), cerebral autosomal-dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), cathepsin A-related arteriopathy with strokes and leukoencephalopathy (CARASAL), hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with spheroids (HDLS), COL4A1/2-related disorders, and Fabry disease. These disorders can be distinguished based on their genetics, pathological and imaging findings, clinical manifestation, and diagnosis. Genetic studies of sporadic cerebral SVD have demonstrated a high degree of heritability, particularly among patients with young-onset stroke. Common genetic variants in monogenic disease may contribute to pathological progress in several cerebral SVD subtypes, revealing distinct genetic mechanisms in different subtype of SVD. Hence, genetic molecular analysis should be used as the final gold standard of diagnosis. The purpose of this review was to summarize the recent discoveries made surrounding the genetics of cerebral SVD and their clinical significance, to provide new insights into the pathogenesis of cerebral SVD, and to highlight the possible convergence of disease mechanisms in monogenic and sporadic cerebral SVD.
