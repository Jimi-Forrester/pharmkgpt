28713690|a|AIM: To evaluate usefulness of single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with three-dimensional stereotactic surface projection (3D-SSP) in distinguishing between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and depression. METHODS: We studied 43 patients who presented with both depressive symptoms and memory disturbance. Each subject was evaluated using the following: (1) the Minimal Mental State Examination; (2) the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression; (3) Clinical Global Impression-Severity scale (CGI-S); and (4) SPECT imaging with 3D-SSP. RESULTS: The MMSE scores correlated significantly with the maximum Z-scores of AD-associated regions. CGI-S scores correlated significantly with the maximum Z-scores of depression-associated regions. Factor analysis identified three significant factors. Of these, Factor 1 could be interpreted as favouring a tendency for AD, Factor 2 as favouring a tendency for pseudo-dementia, and Factor 3 as favouring a depressive tendency. CONCLUSION: We investigated whether these patients could be categorized as types: Type A (true AD), Type B (pseudo-dementia), Type C (occult AD), and Type D (true depression). The factor scores in factor analysis supported the validity of this classification. Our results suggest that SPECT with 3D-SSP is highly useful for distinguishing between depression and depressed mood in the early stage of AD.
