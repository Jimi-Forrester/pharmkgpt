37102466|a|The study recently published on the clinical effect of lecanemab in early Alzheimer's disease (AD) only includes patients with amnestic presentation. However, a significant portion of AD patients presents a non-amnestic phenotype of AD, such as primary progressive aphasia (PPA) and could benefit of rather than on lecanemab. Therefore, we conducted a 10-year retrospective study at the Leenaards Memory Center in Lausanne (Switzerland) to identify how many PPA patients would be eligible for lecanemab. Among 54 patients with PPA, we identified 11 (20%) eligible patients. Furthermore, almost half of the 18 patients with logopenic variant would be eligible for lecanemab treatment.
