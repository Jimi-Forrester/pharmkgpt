30560037|t|Matched Cohort Analysis of Elective Lumbar Spinal Fusion in Patients With and Without Parkinson's Disease: In-hospital Complications, Length of Stay, and Hospital Charges.
30560037|a|STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort. OBJECTIVES: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative condition associated with significant morbidity and mortality. PD patients often develop spinal conditions and are known to have high complication rates following surgery. This study evaluated the outcomes of lumbar fusion surgery in patients with PD using a large, public, national database. METHODS: The Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) was used to identify elective lumbar spinal fusion patients with and without PD for the years 2000 to 2012. PD patients were matched with non-PD controls for comorbidity and age using propensity score matching. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression were used to determine the relationship between PD and surgical outcomes in the matched cohort. RESULTS: A total of 231 351 elective lumbar fusion patients were examined, of which 1332 had PD. Before matching, elective lumbar fusion patients with PD were significantly older (P < .001) and more likely male (P < .001) compared with non-PD patients. In the matched cohort, PD was associated with increased length of stay (6.91 vs 5.78 days) (P < .001) and total hospital charges ($129 212.40 vs $110 324.40) (P < .001). There was no significant difference in overall in-hospital complication rate between PD patients and matched non-PD patients (22.3% vs 21.4%) (P = .524). CONCLUSIONS: Analysis demonstrated significant increases in length and cost of hospitalization for elective lumbar spinal fusion in patients with PD. However, inpatient complication rates in PD patients were not significantly increased. As a growing number of PD patients undergo elective spine surgery, further studies are needed to optimize operative planning. Further study is needed to assess the long-term outcomes of lumbar spinal fusion in PD.
