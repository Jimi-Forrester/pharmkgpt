37391468|t|Lipoxygenase inhibitory synthetic derivatives of methyl gallate regulate gene expressions of COX-2 and cytokines to reduce animal model arthritis.
37391468|a|Mammalian lipoxygenases (LOXs) are involved in the biosynthesis of mediators of anaphylactic reactions and have been implicated in cell maturation, the pathogenesis of bronchial asthma, atherosclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, cardiovascular diseases, Alzheimer's disease and osteoporosis. Hence LOX inhibition in chronic conditions can lead to reducing the disease progression, which can be a good target for treating these diseases. The present study deals with designing methyl gallate derivatives and their anti-inflammatory effect by in silico, in vitro and in vivo methods. Designed derivatives were docked against LOX enzyme, and molecular dynamic simulations were carried out. Following the synthesis of derivatives, in vitro LOX inhibition assay, enzyme kinetics and fluorescence quenching studies were performed. One of the derivatives of methyl gallate (MGSD 1) was demonstrated as an anti-inflammatory agent for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in the animal model. Amelioration of Freund's complete adjuvant (FCA)-induced arthritis by methyl gallate and its derivative with a concentration of 10-40 mg.kg-1 has been assessed in vivo in a 28-day-long study. TNF-alpha and COX-2 gene expression were also studied. Methyl gallate synthetic derivatives (MGSDs) inhibited LOX with an IC50 of 100 nM, 304 nM, and 226 nM for MGSD 1, MGSD 2, and MGSD 3, respectively. Fluorescence quenching methods also prove their binding characteristics, and 200 ns simulations studies showed that the RMSDs for the entire complex were less than 2.8 A. The in vivo results showed that methyl gallate was required approximately five times diclofenac for the same level of effect, and the synthesised (MGSD 1) compound required only approximately 1/12 of diclofenac for the same level of effect in in-vivo studies. The preeminent expression of COX-2 and TNF-alpha genes was significantly decreased after the treatment of the methyl gallate derivative. Hence, the in vivo results showed that the referenced synthetic derivative might have more arthritis-reducing properties than the parent compound methyl gallate and is more potent than the standard drug diclofenac, with no apparent induced toxicity.
