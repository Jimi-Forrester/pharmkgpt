38883759|a|The UK Biobank (UKB) imaging project is a crucial resource for biomedical research, but is limited to 100,000 participants due to cost and accessibility barriers. Here we used genetic data to predict heritable imaging-derived phenotypes (IDPs) for a larger cohort. We developed and evaluated 4,375 IDP genetic scores (IGS) derived from UKB brain and body images. When applied to UKB participants who were not imaged, IGS revealed links to numerous phenotypes and stratified participants at increased risk for both brain and somatic diseases. For example, IGS identified individuals at higher risk for Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis, offering additional insights beyond traditional polygenic risk scores of these diseases. When applied to independent external cohorts, IGS also stratified those at high disease risk in the All of Us Research Program and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative study. Our results demonstrate that, while the UKB imaging cohort is largely healthy and may not be the most enriched for disease risk management, it holds immense potential for stratifying the risk of various brain and body diseases in broader external genetic cohorts.
