37308838|a|Starting from the perspective of an immune-privileged site, our knowledge of the inflammatory processes within the central nervous system has increased rapidly over the last 30 years, leading to a rather puzzling picture today. Of particular interest is the emergence of disease- and injury-specific inflammatory responses within the brain, which may form the basis for future therapeutic approaches. To advance this important topic, we invite authors to contribute research and clinical papers to the Collection "Neuroinflammation and Brain Disease".
