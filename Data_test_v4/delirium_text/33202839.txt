33202839|t|Nano Carrier Drug Delivery Systems for the Treatment of Neuropsychiatric Disorders: Advantages and Limitations.
33202839|a|Neuropsychiatric diseases are one of the main causes of disability, affecting millions of people. Various drugs are used for its treatment, although no effective therapy has been found yet. The blood brain barrier (BBB) significantly complicates drugs delivery to the target cells in the brain tissues. One of the problem-solving methods is the usage of nanocontainer systems. In this review we summarized the data about nanoparticles drug delivery systems and their application for the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders. Firstly, we described and characterized types of nanocarriers: inorganic nanoparticles, polymeric and lipid nanocarriers, their advantages and disadvantages. We discussed ways to interact with nerve tissue and methods of BBB penetration. We provided a summary of nanotechnology-based pharmacotherapy of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, anxiety disorder and Alzheimer's disease, where development of nanocontainer drugs derives the most active. We described various experimental drugs for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease that include vector nanocontainers targeted on beta-amyloid or tau-protein. Integrally, nanoparticles can substantially improve the drug delivery as its implication can increase BBB permeability, the pharmacodynamics and bioavailability of applied drugs. Thus, nanotechnology is anticipated to overcome the limitations of existing pharmacotherapy of psychiatric disorders and to effectively combine various treatment modalities in that direction.
