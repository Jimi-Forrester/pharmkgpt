2470170|a|Within the past decade intensive molecular genetic research has been carried out in the attempt to pinpoint chromosomal loci that may be linked to neuropsychiatric disorders. Joseph Martin reviews progress made in the application of molecular genetics to the study of diseases such as Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease, familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy and inherited nervous system tumors.
