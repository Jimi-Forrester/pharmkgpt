35892011|a|Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with cognitive functional impairment or dementia in addition to cardiovascular diseases. Aging of the population and the increasing prevalence of CKD in elderly patients are making dementia more prevalent. Blood pressure (BP) variability is an important risk factor for dementia. Although ample data link high BP variability with the risk of dementia in the general population, data on CKD patients are scarce. An observational cohort study conducted by Park et al., including 103 139 patients, demonstrated a strong association between higher visit-to-visit BP variability and increased risk of dementia in CKD patients. Both higher systolic and diastolic BP variabilities were associated with any type of dementia, including Alzheimer's and vascular dementia. Physicians must be aware of BP variability when evaluating CKD patients with hypertension.
