34966024|t|Limited Longitudinal Change in Self-reported Spatial Navigation Ability in Preclinical Alzheimer Disease.
34966024|a|Subtle changes in objective spatial navigation ability have been observed in the preclinical stage of Alzheimer disease (AD) cross-sectionally and have been found to predict clinical progression. However, longitudinal change in self-reported spatial navigation ability in preclinical AD has yet to be examined. The current study examined whether AD biomarkers suggestive of preclinical AD at baseline spatial navigation assessment and APOE genotype predicted decline in self-reported spatial navigation ability and whether APOE genotype moderated the association of AD biomarkers with change in self-reported spatial navigation. Clinically normal (Clinical Dementia Rating Scale=0) adults aged 56 to 90 completed the Santa Barbara Sense of Direction Scale (SBSOD) annually for an average of 2.73 years. Biomarker data was collected within +/-2 years of baseline (ie, cerebrospinal fluid Abeta42, p-tau181, p-tau181/Abeta42 ratio, positron emission tomography imaging with Florbetapir or Pittsburgh Compound-B, and hippocampal volume). APOE genotyping was obtained for all participants. SBSOD demonstrated a nonsignificant trend toward a decline over time (P=0.082). AD biomarkers did not predict change in self-reported spatial navigation (all Ps>0.163). APOE genotype did not moderate the relationship between AD biomarkers and self-reported spatial navigation in planned analyses (all Ps>0.222). Results suggest that self-reported spatial navigation ability, as estimated with the SBSOD, may be limited as a measure of subtle cognitive change in the preclinical stage of AD.
