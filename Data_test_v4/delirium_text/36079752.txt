36079752|t|The Therapeutic Relevance of Urolithins, Intestinal Metabolites of Ellagitannin-Rich Food: A Systematic Review of In Vivo Studies.
36079752|a|The therapeutic effects of food rich in ellagitannins have been established to stem from its microbial metabolite, urolithin. Over the past decade, there has been a growing trend in urolithin research pertaining to its pharmacological properties. The purpose of this systematic review is to collate and synthesise all available data on urolithin's therapeutic ability, to highlight its potential as a pharmaceutical agent, and prospective direction on future research. METHODS: This systematic review was written based on the PRISMA guideline and was conducted across Ovid via Embase, Ovid MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register for Controlled Trials, and Web of Science Core Collection. RESULTS: A total of 41 animal studies were included in this systematic review based on the appropriate keyword. The included studies highlighted the neuroprotective, anti-metabolic disorder activity, nephroprotective, myocardial protective, anti-inflammatory, and musculoskeletal protection of urolithin A, B, and its synthetic analogue methylated urolithin A. The Sirt1, AMPK, and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signalling pathways were reported to be involved in the initiation of autophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis by urolithin A. CONCLUSIONS: This review methodically discusses the therapeutic prospects of urolithins and provides scientific justification for the potential development of urolithin A as a potent natural mitophagy inducer for anti-ageing purposes.
