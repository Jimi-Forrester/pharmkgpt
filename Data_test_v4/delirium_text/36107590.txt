36107590|a|BACKGROUND: Although midazolam is widely administered as an anxiolytic premedication, it may cause over-sedation and hypoxia in geriatric patients. Cranial electrotherapy stimulation (CES) is a nonpharmacological device with anxiolytic effect. This study compared the effects of CES and midazolam as a preoperative treatment in geriatric patients. METHODS: Eighty patients, under the age of 65 to 79 years, undergoing general anesthesia were randomly assigned into midazolam premedication group (M group, n = 40) or CES pretreatment group (CES group, n = 40). The patients in the M group were intramuscularly injected with midazolam (0.07 mg/kg) 30 minutes before receiving general anesthesia. The patients in the CES group received 20 minutes of CES pretreatment on the day before and on the morning of the surgery. RESULTS: In the preoperative holding area, the anxiety score (P = .02) and the sedation score (P < .001) were significantly lower in the CES group compared with those in the M group. The oxygen saturations at the preoperative holding area and the operating room were significantly higher in the CES group than those in the M group (P < .001). CONCLUSION: CES pretreatment relieved preoperative anxiety with less risk of over-sedation and respiratory depression than midazolam premedication in geriatric patients.
