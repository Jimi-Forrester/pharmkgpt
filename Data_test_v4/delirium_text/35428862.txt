35428862|a|Traumatic brain injury (TBI) results in a cascade of cellular responses, which produce neuroinflammation, partly due to the activation of microglia. Accurate identification of microglial populations is key to understanding therapeutic approaches that modify microglial responses to TBI and improve long-term outcome measures. Notably, previous studies often utilized an outdated convention to describe microglial phenotypes. We conducted a temporal analysis of the response to controlled cortical impact (CCI) in rat microglia between ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres across seven time points, identified microglia through expression of activation markers including CD45, CD11b/c, and p2y12 receptor and evaluated their activation state using additional markers of CD32, CD86, RT1B, CD200R, and CD163. We identified unique sub-populations of microglial cells that express individual or combination of activation markers across time points. We further portrayed how the size of these sub-populations changes through time, corresponding to stages in TBI response. We described longitudinal changes in microglial population after CCI in two different locations using activation markers, showing clear separation into cellular sub-populations that feature different temporal patterns of markers after injury. These changes may aid in understanding the symptomatic progression following TBI and help define microglial subpopulations beyond the outdated M1/M2 paradigm.
