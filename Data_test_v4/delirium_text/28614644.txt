28614644|a|The aim of the study was to increase the efficiency of the treatment of acute ethanol intoxication in patients with alcoholic fatty liver disease. The article presents the results which received during the investigation and treatment of 166 patients with acute ethanol in- toxication on the background of alcoholic fatty liver disease Patients were assessed by the severity scale APACHE-Il. Were studied the dynamics of clinical, laboratory, biochemical parameters, the state of the antioxidant system activity and lipid peroxidation. The study found the effect of the combination hepatoprotective drug remaxol on the many links of metabolism, which was confirmed by the dynamics of biochemical parameters. There was a quick correction of hyperlactatemia, an effective reduction of ALT activity, the absence of reduction of albumin and urea concentration in the somatic period of ethanol poisoning. Period of using remaxol there was improvement in the clinical course of the disease, which manifested by the reduce the incidence of delirium tremens and shorten the duration of treatment of patients.
