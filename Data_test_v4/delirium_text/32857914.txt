32857914|t|Association between ambulatory blood pressure variability and frailty among older hypertensive patients.
32857914|a|Frailty and hypertension often coexist and are increasingly prevalent with advancing age. Although hypertension is independently associated with frailty, whether high blood pressure variability affecting frailty is unclear. In this retrospective study, we consecutively enrolled elderly patients with essential hypertension undergoing 24-hour ABPM. The frailty was assessed by a 38-item frailty index. The parameters of blood pressure variability of ABPM, including ARV, coefficient of CV, SD, and weighed SD were calculated. Ordinal logistic regression was used to investigate the association between blood pressure variability and frailty. A total of 242 hypertensive patients were recruited and divided into the frail group, pre-frail group, and non-frail group. The overall magnitudes of BP variability, assessed by ARV, CV, SD, and weighed SD, were significantly greater in patients with frailty than those with pre-frailty and non-frailty. With adjustment for covariates, ARV of 24-hour, diurnal, and nocturnal SBP were independently associated with frailty (24 hours, OR: 2.48, 95% CI: 2.01-3.07; daytime, OR: 1.83, 95% CI: 1.60-2.10; nighttime, OR: 1.19, 95% CI: 1.12-1.27). The CV of 24-hour, diurnal, and nocturnal SBP was independently associated with frailty in the study (24 hours, OR: 1.2, 95% CI: 1.05-3.07; daytime, OR: 1.19, 95% CI: 1.05-1.34; nighttime, OR: 1.13, 95% CI: 1.03-1.24). For SD and weighed SD, only 24-hour systolic SD was independent risk factor associated with frailty (OR: 1.12, 95% CI: 1.01-1.23). The greater blood pressure variability of SBP, particular ARV and CV, were independent risk factors associated with higher-order frailty status. Longitudinal studies are needed to investigate the causality associations between hypertension and frailty.
