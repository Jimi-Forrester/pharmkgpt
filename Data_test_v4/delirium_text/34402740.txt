34402740|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorder with complex etiology that eventually leads to dementia. The main culprit of AD is the extracellular deposition of beta-amyloid (Abeta) and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles. The protein conformational change and protein misfolding are the key events of AD pathophysiology; therefore, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is an apparent consequence. ER, stress-induced unfolded protein response (UPR) mediators (viz. PERK, IRE1, and ATF6) have been reported widely in the AD brain. Considering these factors, preventing protein misfolding or aggregation of tau or amyloidogenic proteins appears to be the best approach to halt its pathogenesis. Therefore, therapies through chemical and pharmacological chaperones came to light as an alternative for the treatment of AD. Diverse studies have demonstrated 4-phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA) as a potential therapeutic agent in AD. The current review outlined the mechanism of protein misfolding, different etiological features behind the progression of AD, the significance of ER stress in AD, and the potential therapeutic role of different chaperones to counter AD. The study also highlights the gaps in current knowledge of the chaperones-based therapeutic approach and the possibility of developing chaperones as a potential therapeutic agent for AD treatment.
