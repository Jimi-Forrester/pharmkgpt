21651910|a|The amyloid precursor protein (APP) is proteolytically processed by beta- and gamma-secretases to release amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta), the main component found in senile plaques of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patient brains. Alternatively, APP can be cleaved within the Abeta sequence by alpha-secretase, thus precluding the generation of Abeta. We have demonstrated that activation of the P2X7 receptor leads to a reduction of alpha-secretase activity in Neuro-2a cells. Moreover, the P2X7 ligand 2'(3')-O-(4-benzoylbenzoyl) ATP (BzATP) can also activate a different P2 receptor in these cells. This receptor, whose pharmacology resembles that of the P2Y(2) receptor, has an opposite effect, leading to increases in alpha-secretase activity. Our study suggests that P2X7R and P2Y(2)R could be novel therapeutic targets in AD.
