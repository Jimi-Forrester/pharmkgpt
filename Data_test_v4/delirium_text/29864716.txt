29864716|t|A simple and clinically relevant combination of neuroimaging and functional indexes for the identification of those at highest risk of Alzheimer's disease.
29864716|a|The current challenge in clinical practice is to identify those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), who are at greater risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) conversion in the near future. The aim of this study was to assess a clinically practical new hippocampal index-hippocampal volume normalized by cerebellar volume (hippocampus to cerebellum volume ratio) used alone or in combination with scores on the Mini-Mental State Examination, as a predictor of conversion from MCI to AD. The predictive value of the HCCR was also contrasted to that of the hippocampal volume to intracranial volume ratio. The findings revealed that the performance of the combination of measures was significantly better than that of each measure used individually. The combination of Mini-Mental State Examination and hippocampal volume, normalized by the cerebellum or by intracranial volume, accurately discriminated individuals with MCI who progress to AD within 5 years from other MCI types (stable, reverters) and those with intact cognition (area under receiver operating curve of 0.88 and 0.89, respectively). Normalization by cerebellar volume was as accurate as normalization by intracranial volume with the advantage of being more practical, particularly for serial assessments.
