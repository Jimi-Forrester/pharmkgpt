38002000|t|Targeting Autophagy, Apoptosis, and Oxidative Perturbations with Dapagliflozin Mitigates Cadmium-Induced Cognitive Dysfunction in Rats.
38002000|a|Cognitive decline and Alzheimer-like neuropathology are common manifestations of cadmium toxicity. Thanks to its antioxidant/anti-apoptotic features, dapagliflozin has demonstrated promising neuroprotective actions. However, its effect on cadmium-induced neurotoxicity is lacking. The present work aimed to examine whether dapagliflozin could protect rats from cadmium-evoked cognitive decline. In this study, the behavioral disturbances and hippocampal biomolecular alterations were studied after receiving dapagliflozin. Herein, cadmium-induced memory/learning decline was rescued in the Morris water maze, novel object recognition task, and Y-shaped maze by dapagliflozin. Meanwhile, the hippocampal histopathological abnormalities were mitigated. The molecular mechanisms revealed that dapagliflozin lowered hippocampal expression of p-tau and Abeta42 neurotoxic proteins while augmenting acetylcholine. The cognitive enhancement was triggered by hippocampal autophagy stimulation, as indicated by decreased SQSTM-1/p62 and Beclin 1 upregulation. Meanwhile, a decrease in p-mTOR/total mTOR and an increase in p-AMPK/total AMPK ratio were observed in response to dapagliflozin, reflecting AMPK/mTOR cascade stimulation. Dapagliflozin, on the other hand, dampened the pro-apoptotic processes in the hippocampus by downregulating Bax, upregulating Bcl-2, and inactivating GSK-3beta. The hippocampal oxidative insult was mitigated by dapagliflozin as seen by lipid peroxide lowering, antioxidants augmentation, and SIRT1/Nrf2/HO-1 pathway activation. In conclusion, dapagliflozin's promising neuroprotection was triggered by its pro-autophagic, anti-apoptotic, and antioxidant properties.
