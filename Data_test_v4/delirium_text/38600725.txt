38600725|t|Phytomedicine for neurodegenerative diseases: The road ahead.
38600725|a|Neurodegenerative disorders (NDs) are among the most common causes of death across the globe. NDs are characterized by progressive damage to CNS neurons, leading to defects in specific brain functions such as memory, cognition, and movement. The most common NDs are Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, Huntington's, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Despite extensive research, no therapeutics or medications against NDs have been proven to be effective. The current treatment of NDs involving symptom-based targeting of the disease pathogenesis has certain limitations, such as drug resistance, adverse side effects, poor blood-brain barrier permeability, and poor bioavailability of drugs. Some studies have shown that plant-derived natural compounds hold tremendous promise for treating and preventing NDs. Therefore, the primary objective of this review article is to critically analyze the properties and potency of some of the most studied phytomedicines, such as quercetin, curcumin, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), apigenin, and cannabinoids, and highlight their advantages and limitations for developing next-generation alternative treatments against NDs. Further extensive research on pre-clinical and clinical studies for developing plant-based drugs against NDs from bench to bedside is warranted.
