37295717|t|A Peptidisc-based Survey of the Plasma Membrane Proteome of a Mammalian Cell.
37295717|a|Membrane proteins play critical roles at the cell surface, and their misfunction is a hallmark of many human diseases. A precise evaluation of the plasma membrane proteome is, therefore, essential for cell biology and for discovering novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets. However, the low abundance of this proteome relative to soluble proteins makes it difficult to characterize, even with the most advanced proteomics technologies. Here, we apply the peptidisc membrane mimetic to purify the cell membrane proteome. Using the HeLa cell line as a reference, we capture 500 different integral membrane proteins, with half annotated to the plasma membrane. Notably, the peptidisc library is enriched with several medically-relevant ABC, SLC, GPCR, CD, and cell adhesion molecules that generally exist at low to very low copy numbers in the cell. We extend the method to compare two pancreatic cell lines, Panc-1 and hPSC. Consistent with other studies, we observe a striking difference in the relative abundance of the cancer markers L1CAM, ANPEP, ITGB4, and CD70. We also identify two novel SLC transporters, SLC30A1 and SLC12A7, that are highly present in the Panc-1 cell only. The peptidisc workflow thus emerges as an effective way to survey and compare the membrane protein system of mammalian cells. Furthermore, since the method stabilizes proteins in a water-soluble state, members of the library can be isolated, here SLC12A7.
