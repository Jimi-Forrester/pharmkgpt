28031594|t|Suicide in Rural Central India: Profile of Attempters of Deliberate Self Harm Presenting to Padhar Hospital in Madhya Pradesh.
28031594|a|BACKGROUND: Suicide is a significant public health issue. India currently has the largest number of suicides in the world and has a disproportionate number of youth suicides including young women. The studies on patterns of suicide in rural central India are sparse, particularly among tribal communities. AIMS: The aim of this study is to describe the profile of suicide attempters presenting to a secondary-level hospital in rural central India and identify areas for potential future research toward preventive strategies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective chart review was carried out of eighty patients who were admitted with presenting complaints of deliberate self-harm and survived until psychiatric consultation. Descriptive statistics was employed to generate the results. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: 86% of the attempts were isolated impulsive attempts following triggers, the most common of which was interpersonal disputes (71%). Only 67% of patients had a mental health condition, the most common syndrome being alcohol use disorder, followed by depression, and personality disorders. Although 45% of attempters had background interpersonal conflicts, only 5% reported financial stressors as contributory. Psychosocial stressors, especially interpersonal conflicts within the family, appear to be at least as important factors as mental illnesses in contributing to suicide attempts in the area.
