36399862|a|BACKGROUND: Intensive Care Unit Recovery Clinics (ICU-RCs) were founded to address post-intensive care syndrome among ICU survivors. Telemedicine ICU-RCs may facilitate access for more ICU survivors, however, patient and caregiver experiences with telemedicine ICU-RCs have not been explored qualitatively. OBJECTIVE: To explore patient and informal caregiver experiences with a telemedicine ICU-RC. METHODS: Our qualitative exploratory cross-sectional study was guided by qualitative description methodology. Telemedicine ICU-RC visits were conducted at 3- and 12-weeks post-discharge following critical illness. Patients, and caregivers when available, met with an ICU pharmacist, ICU physician, and a neuropsychologist via Zoom. Thereafter, we conducted qualitative (1:1) telephone interviews with 14 patients and 12 caregivers recruited purposefully. Data were analyzed using conventional content analysis. RESULTS: Five themes were identified: (1) general impressions of the intervention; (2) intervention organization and delivery; (3) intervention substance; (4) caregiver participation; and (5) ways to improve the intervention. Participants found the telemedicine delivery acceptable, convenient, time-saving, and conducive to thorough discussions. Participants appreciated the information, reassurance, and validation. Attention to mental health during the visits was strongly endorsed. Caregiver involvement depended on patient self-management and technical ability. Suggestions included scheduling a 1-week post-discharge visit, more follow-up visits, and individualizing content for in-depth discussions, including mental health evaluation. CONCLUSIONS: The study results enhance the understanding of patient and caregiver experiences with a telemedicine ICU-RC. Participants' narratives helped to formulate recommendations to improve telemedicine ICU-RC delivery and content. Acceptability of this intervention indicates the potential for wider implementation of telemedicine ICU-RCs to reach more ICU survivors.
