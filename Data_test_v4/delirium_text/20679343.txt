20679343|t|Spectroscopic studies of GSK3{beta} phosphorylation of the neuronal tau protein and its interaction with the N-terminal domain of apolipoprotein E.
20679343|a|Alzheimer disease neurons are characterized by extraneuronal plaques formed by aggregated amyloid-beta peptide and by intraneuronal tangles composed of fibrillar aggregates of the microtubule-associated Tau protein. Tau is mostly found in a hyperphosphorylated form in these tangles. Glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta) is a proline-directed kinase generally considered as one of the major players that (hyper)phosphorylates Tau. The kinase phosphorylates mainly (Ser/Thr)-Pro motifs and is believed to require a priming activity by another kinase. Here, we use an in vitro phosphorylation assay and NMR spectroscopy to characterize in a qualitative and quantitative manner the phosphorylation of Tau by GSK3beta. We find that three residues can be phosphorylated (Ser-396, Ser-400, and Ser-404) by GSK3beta alone, without priming. Ser-404 is essential in this process, as its mutation to Ala prevents all activity of GSK3beta. However, priming enhances the catalytic efficacy of the kinase, as initial phosphorylation of Ser-214 by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) leads to the rapid modification by GSK3beta of four regularly spaced additional sites. Because the regular incorporation of negative charges by GSK3beta leads to a potential parallel between phospho-Tau and heparin, we investigated its interaction with the heparin/low density lipoprotein receptor binding domain of human apolipoprotein E. We indeed observed an interaction between the GSK3beta-promoted regular phospho-pattern on Tau and the apolipoprotein E fragment but none in the absence of phosphorylation or the presence of an irregular phosphorylation pattern by the prolonged activity of PKA. Apolipoprotein E is therefore able to discriminate and interact with specific phosphorylation patterns of Tau.
