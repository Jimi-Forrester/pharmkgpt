37596403|a|Data on the association between Mediterranean diet, sleep and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were limited in Middle Eastern populations. We examined the association between Mediterranean dietary pattern with sleep quality/quantity, and serum BDNF in Iranian adults. This cross-sectional study was performed among 535 middle-aged adults (54% men), selected by multistage cluster random sampling method. The Pittsburgh sleep quality index and a validated food frequency questionnaire were used to assess sleep quality, sleep quantity, and Mediterranean diet score (MDS). Twelve-hour fasting blood samples were taken to evaluate serum BDNF values. Participants in the highest tertile of MDS, in comparison to those in the lowest tertile, had lower odds of having short sleep (OR = 0.44, 95%CI: 0.21-0.91) and poor sleep quality (OR = 0.48, 95%CI: 0.22-0.96), after adjustment for potential confounders. Among specific domains of sleep quality, lower odds of subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, and daytime dysfunction were associated with increased MDS. Higher adherence to MDS among individuals with overweight or obesity reduced the odds of having short sleep; this relation was not seen among individuals with normal weight. In contrast, the association between sleep quality and the MDS was significant in individuals with normal weight, but not those with overweight or obesity. Participants with higher adherence to MDS had lower odds for low BDNF values; however, this relation was not statistically significant. Overall, Iranian adults with a higher adherence to MDS had considerably lower odds of having short sleep and poor sleep quality. BDNF would not be an intermediate molecule for this connection.
