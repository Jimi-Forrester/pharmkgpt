38921877|t|Multi-Endpoint Toxicological Assessment of Chrysin Loaded Oil-in-Water Emulsion System in Different Biological Models.
38921877|a|Chrysin is hypothesized to possess the ability to prevent different illnesses, such as diabetes, cancer, and neurodegenerative disorders. Nonetheless, chrysin has a low solubility under physiological conditions, resulting in limited bioavailability. In a previous study, we utilized an oil-in-water emulsion system (chrysin-ES or chrysin-NE) to encapsulate chrysin, thereby increasing its bioaccessibility and preserving its antioxidant and anti-Alzheimer's properties. To promote the chrysin-ES as a supplementary and functional food, it was obligatory to carry out a safety assessment. Cytotoxicity testing showed that chrysin-ES was harmless, with no killing effect on 3T3-L1 (adipocytes), RAW 264.7 (macrophages), HEK293 (kidney cells), and LX-2 (hepatic stellate cells). The acute toxicity evaluation demonstrated that the 50% lethal dose (LD50) for chrysin-ES was greater than 2000 mg/kg BW. Genotoxicity assessments found that chrysin-ES did not induce DNA mutations in vitro or in vivo. Furthermore, chrysin and chrysin-ES exhibited anti-mutagenic properties against PhIP-induced and IQ-induced mutagenesis in the Ames test, while they inhibited urethane-, ethyl methanesulfonate-, mitomycin C-, and N-nitrosomethylurea-mediated mutations in Drosophila. The present study illustrates the safety and anti-genotoxicity properties of chrysin-ES, allowing for the further development of chrysin-based food supplements and nutraceuticals.
