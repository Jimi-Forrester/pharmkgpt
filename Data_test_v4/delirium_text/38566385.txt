38566385|a|About 60% to 70% of people with dementia have Alzheimer's Disease (AD), a neuro-degenerative illness. One reason for this disorder is the misfolding of naturally occurring proteins in the human brain, specifically beta-amyloid (Abeta) and tau. Certain diagnostic imaging techniques, such as amyloid PET imaging, tau PET imaging, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Comput-erized Tomography (CT), and others, can detect biomarkers in blood, plasma, and cerebral spinal fluids, like an increased level of beta-amyloid, plaques, and tangles. In order to create new pharma-cotherapeutics for Alzheimer's disease, researchers must have a thorough and detailed knowledge of amyloid beta misfolding and other related aspects. Dolopezil, rivastigmine, galantamine, and other acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are among the medications now used to treat Alzheimer's disease. Another medication that can temporarily alleviate dementia symptoms is memantine, which blocks the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. However, it is not able to halt or re-verse the progression of the disease. Medication now on the market can only halt its advance-ment, not reverse it. Interventions to alleviate behavioral and psychological symptoms, exhibit an-ti-neuroinflammation and anti-tau effects, induce neurotransmitter alteration and cognitive en-hancement, and provide other targets have recently been developed. For some Alzheimer's pa-tients, the FDA-approved monoclonal antibody, aducanumab, is an option; for others, phase 3 clinical studies are underway for drugs, like lecanemab and donanemab, which have demonstrat-ed potential in eliminating amyloid protein. However, additional study is required to identify and address these limitations in order to reduce the likelihood of side effects and maximize the thera-peutic efficacy.
