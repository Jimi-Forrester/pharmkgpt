36877047|t|Predicting Neurodegenerative Disease Using Prepathology Gut Microbiota Composition: a Longitudinal Study in Mice Modeling Alzheimer's Disease Pathologies.
36877047|a|The gut microbiota-brain axis is suspected to contribute to the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative disease characterized by amyloid-beta plaque deposition, neurofibrillary tangles, and neuroinflammation. To evaluate the role of the gut microbiota-brain axis in AD, we characterized the gut microbiota of female 3xTg-AD mice modeling amyloidosis and tauopathy and wild-type (WT) genetic controls. Fecal samples were collected fortnightly from 4 to 52 weeks, and the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq. RNA was extracted from the colon and hippocampus, converted to cDNA, and used to measure immune gene expression using reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Diversity metrics were calculated using QIIME2, and a random forest classifier was applied to predict bacterial features that are important in predicting mouse genotype. Gene expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP; indicating astrocytosis) was elevated in the colon at 24 weeks. Markers of Th1 inflammation (il6) and microgliosis (mrc1) were elevated in the hippocampus. Gut microbiota were compositionally distinct early in life between 3xTg-AD mice and WT mice (permutational multivariate analysis of variance [PERMANOVA], 8 weeks, P = 0.001, 24 weeks, P = 0.039, and 52 weeks, P = 0.058). Mouse genotypes were correctly predicted 90 to 100% of the time using fecal microbiome composition. Finally, we show that the relative abundance of Bacteroides species increased over time in 3xTg-AD mice. Taken together, we demonstrate that changes in bacterial gut microbiota composition at prepathology time points are predictive of the development of AD pathologies. IMPORTANCE Recent studies have demonstrated alterations in the gut microbiota composition in mice modeling Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathologies; however, these studies have only included up to 4 time points. Our study is the first of its kind to characterize the gut microbiota of a transgenic AD mouse model, fortnightly, from 4 weeks of age to 52 weeks of age, to quantify the temporal dynamics in the microbial composition that correlate with the development of disease pathologies and host immune gene expression. In this study, we observed temporal changes in the relative abundances of specific microbial taxa, including the genus Bacteroides, that may play a central role in disease progression and the severity of pathologies. The ability to use features of the microbiota to discriminate between mice modeling AD and wild-type mice at prepathology time points indicates a potential role of the gut microbiota as a risk or protective factor in AD.
