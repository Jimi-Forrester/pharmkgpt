32711412|t|Validation of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy with Cervical Cancer Subscale (FACT-CX) for Quality of Life in Thai Patients Prior to Chemoradiotherapy.
32711412|a|OBJECTIVE: Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer in Thailand. For cervical cancer, there is no cancer specific quality of life questionnaire. This study aims to develop and validate Thai FACT-CX. METHODS: The cross-sectional study included all women aged >=18 years with stage IB2-IIIB who planned to undergo chemoradiotherapy. Those who did not understand Thai language, had other cancers (except for skin cancer), were diagnosed with impaired cognition and/or overt psychosis, and major depression were excluded. The FACT-CX comprises 42 items with 5 domains and a score range of 0-168. The WHOQOL-BREF comprises 26 items with 4 domains and a score range of 26-130. The participants were interviewed about demographic and clinical data. Both questionnaires were self-completed.  Factor analysis was used to compare our data with the previous structure. The reliability used Cronbach's alpha. Spearman's correlation determined relationship between the domains of the modified FACT-CX and WHOQOL-BREF. Both questionnaires were compared with socioeconomic and clinical variables using the Ranksum test and Kruskal-Wallis test. P-value > 0.05 considered significant. RESULTS: The 245 participants included. Expletory factor analysis revealed an accumulative variance of 0.42 with 4 factors. The internal consistency was 0.84, 0.81, 0.78, 0.77 and 0.90 for perception of self, suffering symptoms, family support, life resilience and total questions. There was correlation between the domains of the modified FACT-CX and WHOQOL-BREF.  Both the modified FACT-CX and WHOQOL-BREF could identify differences between the groups of patients. CONCLUSION: Finally, the Thai modified FACT-CX was found to be reliable and valid for measuring quality of life among untreated cervical cancer patients.<br />.
