34084972|a|Human amniotic fluid stem cells (hAFSCs) are growing in interest; yet, little is understood about their secretome and neuroprotective actions in different diseases, including stroke. When stem cells are grown in vitro, they release an array of cytokines and growth factors that can stimulate neuroprotective processes. Furthermore, administering secretome rather than cells may be a safer route for patients who are at risk for rejection, promoting innate restorative processes. Current literature implicates that the miRNA contents of such secretome, more specifically exosomes, may regulate the effectiveness of secretome administration. In this review, we explore what factors may promote pro-survival and pro-apoptotic pathways after the administration of hAFSCs-derived secretome in ischemic models.
