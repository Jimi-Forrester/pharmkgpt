39064055|t|Nutritional Status and Post-Cardiac Surgery Outcomes: An Updated Review with Emphasis on Cognitive Function.
39064055|a|Background/Objectives: Nutritional status significantly influences cardiac surgery outcomes, with malnutrition contributing to poorer results and increased complications. This study addresses the critical gap in understanding by exploring the relationship between pre-operative nutritional status and post-operative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) in adult cardiac patients. Methods: A comprehensive search across key databases investigates the prevalence of malnutrition in pre-operative cardiac surgery patients, its effects, and its association with POCD. Factors exacerbating malnutrition, such as chronic illnesses and reduced functionality, are considered. The study also examines the incidence of POCD, its primary association with CABG procedures, and the impact of malnutrition on complications like inflammation, pulmonary and cardiac failure, and renal injury. Discussions: Findings reveal that 46.4% of pre-operative cardiac surgery patients experience malnutrition, linked to chronic illnesses and reduced functionality. Malnutrition significantly contributes to inflammation and complications, including POCD, with an incidence ranging from 15 to 50%. CABG procedures are particularly associated with POCD, and malnutrition prolongs intensive care stays while increasing vulnerability to surgical stress. Conclusions: The review underscores the crucial role of nutrition in recovery and advocates for a universally recognized nutrition assessment tool tailored to diverse cardiac surgery patients. Emphasizing pre-operative enhanced nutrition as a potential strategy to mitigate inflammation and improve cognitive function, the review highlights the need for integrating nutrition screening into clinical practice to optimize outcomes for high-risk cardiac surgery patients. However, to date, most data came from observational studies; hence, there is a need for future interventional studies to test the hypothesis that pre-operative enhanced nutrition can mitigate inflammation and improve cognitive function in this patient population.
