36373976|a|The increasing incidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) coupled with the lack of therapeutics to address the underlying pathology of the disease has necessitated the need for exploring newer targets. Calcium dysregulation represents a relatively newer target associated with AD. Ca+2 serves as an important cellular messenger in neurons. The concentration of the Ca+2 ion needs to be regulated at optimal concentrations intracellularly for normal functioning of the neurons. This is achieved with the help of mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and neuronal plasma membrane channel proteins. Disruption in normal calcium homeostasis can induce formation of amyloid beta plaques, accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles, and dysfunction of synaptic plasticity, which in turn can affect calcium homeostasis further, thus forming a vicious cycle. Hence, understanding calcium dysregulation can prove to be a key to develop newer therapeutics. This review provides detailed account of physiology of calcium homeostasis and its dysregulation associated with AD. Further, with an understanding of various receptors and organelles involved in these pathways, the review also discusses various calcium channel blockers explored in AD hand in hand with some multitarget molecules addressing calcium as one of the targets.
