30814820|a|OBJECTIVE: A correlation between physical exercise and cognitive improvement has been found in Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study aimed to investigate the effects of aerobic and resistance exercise on the recognition memory and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in beta amyloid (Abeta) model of AD in rat. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty male 8-week-old Wistar rats (250-280 g) were divided into 5 groups (n = 10 each) of control, sham surgery, Abeta-received sedentary, Abeta-received with aerobic exercise and Abeta-received with resistance exercise. AD was induced by intracerebroventricular injection of Abeta25-35 peptide. The sham surgery group received normal saline using the same route and condition. Two groups of Abeta-received animals were trained by treadmill for aerobic exercise and by ladder for strength exercise for 8 weeks (4 days/week). Novel object recognition (NOR) task was used to assess recognitional memory in groups. AChE activity in the brain tissue was assessed using the Spectrophotometry method. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in memory index and AChE activity between the sham surgery and control groups (p > 0.05). Also, impairment of NOR indices was seen in the Abeta-injected sedentary rats (p < 0.05). However, both aerobic and strength training improved the exploration index in this test (p < 0.05). Further, AChE activity increased in the Abeta-injected sedentary group but declined in the aerobic and resistance exercise groups (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Aerobic and resistance exercise could improve recognition memory and decrease AChE activity in Abeta-induced AD in rats. The decrease in AChE activity may be one of the mechanisms by which exercise improves cognition and memory in AD.
