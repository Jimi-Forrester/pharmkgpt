20953160|t|Role of oxidant scavengers in the prevention of Ca2+ homeostasis disorders.
20953160|a|A number of disorders, such as Alzheimer disease and diabetes mellitus, have in common the alteration of the redox balance, resulting in an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation that might lead to the development of apoptosis and cell death. It has long been known that ROS can significantly alter Ca2+ mobilization, an intracellular signal that is involved in the regulation of a wide variety of cellular functions. Cells have a limited capability to counteract the effects of oxidative stress, but evidence has been provided supporting the beneficial effects of exogenous ROS scavengers. Here, we review the effects of oxidative stress on intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis and the role of antioxidants in the prevention and treatment of disorders associated to abnormal Ca2+ mobilization induced by ROS.
