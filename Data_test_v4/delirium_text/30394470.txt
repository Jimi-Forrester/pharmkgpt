30394470|a|Degradation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) aggregates has been considered as an attractive therapeutic and preventive strategy against Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, an in situ, real-time, and label-free technique is still lacking to understand the degradation process of Abeta aggregates. In this work, we developed a novel method to quantitatively evaluate the degradation of Abeta fibrils by photoactive meso-tetra(4-sulfonatophenyl)porphyrin under UV irradiation with quartz crystal microbalance (QCM).
