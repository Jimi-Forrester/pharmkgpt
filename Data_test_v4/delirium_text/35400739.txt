35400739|a|Aims: To identify prevalence of psychiatric comorbidity in clinically stable COVID-19 patients. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional single point observational study was conducted among clinically stable 72 COVID-19 infected patients. Psychiatric comorbidity was assessed with the help of DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 CCSM-Adult scale. Results: The prevalence of psychiatric comorbidity was 76.4% (n = 55). Depression was the most common diagnosis in 44.44% (n = 32) followed by anxiety (34.72%, n = 25), somatic symptoms (26.39%, n = 19), sleep problems (23.61%, n = 17). Around 45 .83 % (n = 33) patients considered COVID-19 infection as potentially life-threatening and 23.62% (n=17) patients experienced discrimination and stigma after being diagnosed with COVID-19 infection. Using binary logistic regression, physical symptoms was identified as a risk factor for psychiatric comorbidity. Conclusion: Our study provides evidence of a significant impact of COVID-19 infection on mental health in COVID-19 patients.
