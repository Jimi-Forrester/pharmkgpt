38542452|t|Alzheimer's Disease: A Molecular Model and Implied Path to Improved Therapy.
38542452|a|Amyloid-associated neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), are characterized by the in-brain accumulation of beta-sheet structured protein aggregates called amyloids. However, neither a disease model nor therapy is established. We review past data and present new, preliminary data and opinions to help solve this problem. The following is the data-derived model/hypothesis. (1) Amyloid-forming proteins have innate immunity functions implemented by conversion to another sheet conformation, alpha-sheet. (2) In health, alpha-sheet structured, amyloid-forming proteins inactivate microbes by co-assembly with microbe alpha-sheets. Amyloid-forming proteins then undergo alpha-to-beta-sheet conversion. (3) In disease, alpha-sheet-structured, amyloid-forming proteins over-accumulate and are neuron-toxic. This hypothesis includes formation by virus capsid subunits of alpha-sheets. In support, we find that 5-10 mM methylene blue (MB) at 54  C has a hyper-expanding, thinning effect on the phage T4 capsid, as seen by negative stain- and cryo-electron microscopy after initial detection by native gel electrophoresis (AGE). Given the reported mild anti-AD effect of MB, we propose the following corollary hypothesis. (1) Anti-AD MB activity is, at least in part, caused by MB-binding to amyloid alpha-sheet and (2) MB induces the transition to alpha-sheet of T4 capsid subunits. We propose using AGE of drug incubated T4 to test for improved anti-AD activity.
