35733767|a|Retinopathy is one of the most devastating complications of diabetes, which a patient fears the most. Hyperglycemic environment results in many structural, functional, molecular and biochemical abnormalities in the retina, and overproduction of mitochondrial superoxide, induced by hyperglycemic milieu, is considered to play a central role in the development of diabetic retinopathy. Expression of many genes associated with maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis is also altered. Recent research has shown that several long noncoding RNAs, RNAs with more than 200 nucleotides but without any reading frames, are aberrantly expressed in diabetes, and altered expression of these long noncoding RNAs is now being implicated in the development of diabetes and its complications including retinopathy. This review focuses the role of long noncoding RNAs in the development of diabetic retinopathy, with a special emphasis on the maintenance of mitochondrial homeostasis.
