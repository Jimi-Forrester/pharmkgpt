34222870|a|Numerous cellular processes, including toxic protein aggregation and oxidative stress, have been studied extensively as potential mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration. However, limited therapeutic efficacy targeting these processes has prompted other mechanisms to be explored. Previous research has emphasized a link between cellular senescence and neurodegeneration, where senescence induced by excess DNA damage and deficient DNA repair results in structural and functional changes that ultimately contribute to brain dysfunction and increased vulnerability for neurodegeneration. Specific DNA repair proteins, such as breast cancer type 1, have been associated with both stress-induced senescence and neurodegenerative diseases, however, specific mechanisms remain unclear. Therefore, this review explores DNA damage-induced senescence in the brain as a driver of neurodegeneration, with particular focus on breast cancer type 1, and its potential contribution to sex-specific differences associated with neurodegenerative disease.
