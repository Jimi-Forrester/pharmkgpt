36136290|t|Laryngeal oncocytic cystadenoma and sudden death.
36136290|a|An 86-year-old woman with Alzheimer disease collapsed in her nursing home and was not able to be resuscitated. At autopsy, the major findings were in the larynx where a pedunculated oncocytic cystadenoma had occluded the glottis. Oncocytic cysts or cystadenomas of the larynx are rare histologically benign lesions that account for only 0.1-1% of laryngeal lesions. While the usual presentation is of a sensation of a mass in the throat, hoarseness, or stridor, very occasionally, there may be acute airway compromise and sudden death. Oncocytic cystadenoma should, therefore, be included in the differential diagnosis of potentially lethal obstructive laryngeal lesions.
