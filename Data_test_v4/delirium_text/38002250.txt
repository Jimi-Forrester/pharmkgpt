38002250|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive cognitive decline and memory impairment. Many possible factors might contribute to the development of AD, including amyloid peptide and tau deposition, but more recent evidence suggests that neuroinflammation may also play an-at least partial-role in its pathogenesis. In recent years, emerging research has explored the possible involvement of external, invading pathogens in starting or accelerating the neuroinflammatory processes in AD. In this narrative review, we advance the hypothesis that neuroinflammation in AD might be partially caused by viral, bacterial, and fungal pathogens entering the brain through the nose and the olfactory system. The olfactory system represents a plausible route for pathogen entry, given its direct anatomical connection to the brain and its involvement in the early stages of AD. We discuss the potential mechanisms through which pathogens may exploit the olfactory pathway to initiate neuroinflammation, one of them being accidental exposure of the olfactory mucosa to hands contaminated with soil and feces when picking one's nose.
