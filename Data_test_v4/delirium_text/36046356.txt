36046356|t|Targeting the two-pore channel 2 in cancer progression and metastasis.
36046356|a|The importance of Ca2+ signaling, and particularly Ca2+ channels, in key events of cancer cell function such as proliferation, metastasis, autophagy and angiogenesis, has recently begun to be appreciated. Of particular note are two-pore channels (TPCs), a group of recently identified Ca2+-channels, located within the endolysosomal system. TPC2 has recently emerged as an intracellular ion channel of significant pathophysiological relevance, specifically in cancer, and interest in its role as an anti-cancer drug target has begun to be explored. Herein, an overview of the cancer-related functions of TPC2 and a discussion of its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention, including a summary of clinical trials examining the TPC2 inhibitors, naringenin, tetrandrine, and verapamil for the treatment of various cancers is provided.
