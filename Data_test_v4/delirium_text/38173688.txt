38173688|t|Developing an Emergency Medicine assessment tool for medical interns within the South African context - A Modified Delphi Study.
38173688|a|Introduction: Emergency Medicine is a relatively new specialty in South Africa. Limited data is available regarding junior doctors' competence in managing emergencies, however previous surveys have identified limited teaching and supervision of junior doctors in Emergency Medicine. Currently there is no formal standardised assessment tool to assess an intern's Emergency Medicine competence. The aim of the study was to, through expert opinion and consensus, develop an Emergency Medicine assessment tool to identify a level of appropriate Emergency Medicine knowledge at the end of internship. Methods: The Modified Delphi Methodology was used to create an assessment tool via interaction with a panel of experts and took place over 4 rounds via an online survey platform. The initial round identified the high-priority topics within each intern domain. A questionnaire was created based on these topics and was presented to the panel for consensus during the following round/s. Rounds continued until each question met consensus of 75 %. Results: A total of 35 panellists consented to participate, representing 6 provinces. The majority were Emergency Medicine specialists. High-priority topics included acute respiratory distress, polytrauma, dehydration and shock in children, airway management, and the agitated patient. A 40-question, multiple choice questionnaire was created with all questions reaching consensus. Conclusion: This study highlighted the core high-priority Emergency Medicine topics that interns should be exposed to during their internship and created a questionnaire aimed at evaluating them. The study findings provide a novel contribution to identifying gaps in Emergency Medicine knowledge during intern training, allowing for potential interventions to be implemented to improve intern EM training. The addition of a clinical skills component and increasing the question database is suggested to further develop this tool. Larger iterative studies involving the HPCSA, and health education experts provide avenues for future research.
