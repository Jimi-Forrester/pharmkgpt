31942171|t|The Effect of Multi-tasking Exercise Intervention on Cognitive Function in Elderly and Cognitive Impairment Patients: a Pilot Multicenter Study.
31942171|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of multi-tasking exercise on cognitive and motor function in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and cognitive normal elderly (CNE). METHODS: A total of 144 subjects were recruited from 14 regional dementia centers in Busan Metropolitan City. With the exception of 77 subjects unsuitable for the study, 67 subjects participated in the intervention. The Korean version of Mini-Mental State Examination for Dementia Screening (MMSE-DS), Subject Memory Complain Questionnaire (SMCQ), and the Korean version of the Short-Form Geriatric Depression Scale (SGDS-K) were used to determine changes in cognitive function and depressive symptoms pre-post intervention in patients with MCI and CNE, respectively. To observe changes in motor function, 5-chair sit to stand and 5-meter walking speed on the lower body strength and walking ability were also measured in both groups. RESULTS: For the MCI group, changes in cognitive and depressive symptoms on the tasks of MMSE-DS (p=0.006), SMCQ (p=0.000), SGDS-K (p=0.000) and the result of the motor function analysis on the items of 5-chair sit to stand (p=0.000), normal speed (p=0.004) and maximal speed (p=0.002) of 5-meter walking speed (p<0.005). In the CNE group, all the items except MMSE-DS (p=0.068) and SGDS-K (p=0.095) showed statistically significant improvement. CONCLUSIONS: Multi-tasking exercise intervention, including exercise and cognitive tasks, may possibly improve the cognitive and motor function in patients with MCI and CNE.
