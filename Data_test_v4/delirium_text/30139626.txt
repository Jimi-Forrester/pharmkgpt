30139626|a|BACKGROUND: Age-related brain changes are well-documented and influenced by genetics. Extensive research links apolipoprotein E (apoE) to brain function, with the E4 allele serving as a risk factor for brain disease, including Alzheimer's disease, and the E2 allele conferring protection. Recent evidence also supports protective effects of another gene, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DRB1*13, on brain disease and age-related brain atrophy in cognitively healthy adults. Here we investigated the effects of apoE and HLA DRB1*13 on brain function by examining changes in neural network properties with age in healthy adults. METHODS: One hundred seventy-eight cognitively healthy women (28-99 y old) underwent a magnetoencephalography scan and provided a blood sample for genetic analysis. Age-related changes in neural network variability in genetic subgroups of DRB1*13 x apoE genotype combinations were assessed using linear regression of network variability against age. FINDINGS: For individuals lacking a DRB1*13 allele and/or carrying an apoE4 allele, network variability increased significantly with age. In contrast, no such increase was observed in the presence of DRB1*13 and/or apoE2. INTERPRETATION: These findings extend previous research documenting the protective effect of DRB1*13 on brain structure to include protection against age-related changes in brain function, and demonstrate similar protective effects on neural network variability for either DRB1*13 or apoE2. These protective effects could be due to reduction or elimination of factors known to disrupt brain function, including neuroinflammation and amyloid beta protein.
