38602321|a|Noninvasive and effortless diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains challenging. Here we report the multiplexed profiling of extracellular vesicle (EV) surface proteins at the single EV level in five types of easily accessible body fluids using a proximity barcoding assay (PBA). A total of 183 surface proteins were detected on the EVs from body fluids collected from APP/PS1 transgenic mice and patients with AD. The AD-associated differentially expressed EV proteins could discriminate between the control and AD/AD model samples with high accuracy. Based on machine learning predictive models, urinary EV proteins exhibited the highest diagnostic potential compared to those on other biofluid EVs, both in mice and humans. Single EV analysis further revealed AD-associated EV subpopulations in the tested body fluids, and a urinary EV subpopulation with the signature proteins PLAU, ITGAX and ANXA1 could diagnose patients with AD in blinded datasets with 88% accuracy. Our results suggest that EVs and their subpopulations from noninvasive body fluids, particularly urine, are potential diagnostic biomarkers for AD.
