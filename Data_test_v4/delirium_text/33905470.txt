33905470|a|BACKGROUND: The insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system is an important system in normal physiological functioning of the body. In diabetes mellitus, alterations of IGF-binding protein (IGFBP) levels have been described, mainly in vascular complications. AIM: The aim of this review was to explore the role of the IGF system in reducing diabetes complications and its role as potential therapeutic target. RESULTS: IGF-1 plays a role in neuronal growth and developmental processes. Low concentrations of IGF-1 have been associated with neuropathy and other diabetes complications. Moreover, impaired IGF synthesis and function may result in cellular senescence and impaired vascular endothelial proliferation, adhesion, and integration. Of note, high IGF-1 bioavailability may prevent or delay the inception of diabetes-associated complications in diabetes patients. The mechanism of normal functioning IGF-1 is induced by increasing nitric oxide synthesis and potassium ion channel opening in cardiovascular physiology, which improves impaired small blood vessel function and reduces the occurrence of diabetes complications associated with reduced concentrations of IGF-1. CONCLUSIONS: IGF may be considered an alternative therapy for diabetes and diabetes-associated complications. Therefore, future studies should focus on the mechanism of action and therapeutic potential of IGFs in reducing the risk of development and progression of the disease in different clinical settings.
