38974208|t|The Impact of Pulmonary Disorders on Neurological Health (Lung-Brain Axis).
38974208|a|The brain and lungs, vital organs in the body, play essential roles in maintaining overall well-being and survival. These organs interact through complex and sophisticated bi-directional pathways known as the 'lung-brain axis', facilitated by their close proximity and neural connections. Numerous studies have underscored the mediation of the lung-brain axis by inflammatory responses and hypoxia-induced damage, which are pivotal to the progression of both pulmonary and neurological diseases. This review aims to delve into how pulmonary diseases, including acute/chronic airway diseases and pulmonary conditions, can instigate neurological disorders such as stroke, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease. Additionally, we highlight the emerging research on the lung microbiome which, drawing parallels between the gut and lungs in terms of microbiome contents, may play a significant role in modulating brain health. Ultimately, this review paves the way for exciting avenues of future research and therapeutics in addressing respiratory and neurological diseases.
