7072578|t|Psychologic sequelae of myocardial infarction.
7072578|a|Myocardial infarction should be understood not only in relation to its biologic impact but also in terms of its psychologic effect. Patients with myocardial infarction pass through identifiable dynamic phases associated with psychologic recovery and adaptation to myocardial damage. These phases consist of denial, anxiety, depression and convalescence. Some therapeutic strategies help the patient to cope with this life-threatening event. Delirium is a special problem after myocardial infarction.
