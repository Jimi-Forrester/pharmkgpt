39332713|a|BACKGROUND: The outcomes of older patients are significantly limited by hospitalization-associated disability (HAD), and there are currently few available management options for HAD. This review aimed to identify and quantify the risk factors for HAD, to provide reliable evidence for developing a HAD prevention program centered on risk factor management among older patients. METHODS: The MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and PubMed databases were searched in March 2024 to identify cross-sectional and cohort studies that used multivariable analysis to examine risk factors for HAD among older patients. RESULTS: We screened 883 studies, 21 of which met our inclusion criteria. Our findings revealed a substantial association between various risk factors and HAD among older patients. Specifically, advanced age, female sex, Caucasian ethnicity, comorbidity burden, better activities of daily living at admission, dementia diagnosis, and longer lengths of stay were significant risk factors for HAD. Furthermore, frailty, poor physical function, immobility, and delirium were identified as confirmed risk factors for HAD among older patients. CONCLUSIONS: This review provided a comprehensive synthesis of available evidence on risk factors for HAD among older patients, serving as a valuable guide for the development of HAD prevention strategies both prior to and during hospitalization.
