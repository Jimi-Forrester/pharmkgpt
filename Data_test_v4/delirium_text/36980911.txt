36980911|t|Genome-Wide Analysis of lncRNA and mRNA Expression in the Uterus of Laying Hens during Aging.
36980911|a|Eggshell plays an essential role in preventing physical damage and microbial invasions. Therefore, the analysis of genetic regulatory mechanisms of eggshell quality deterioration during aging in laying hens is important for the biosecurity and economic performance of poultry egg production worldwide. This study aimed to compare the differences in the expression profiles of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and mRNAs between old and young laying hens by the method of high-throughput RNA sequencing to identify candidate genes associated with aging in the uterus of laying hens. Overall, we detected 176 and 383 differentially expressed (DE) lncRNAs and mRNAs, respectively. Moreover, functional annotation analysis based on the Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) databases revealed that DE-lncRNAs and DE-mRNAs were significantly enriched in "phosphate-containing compound metabolic process", "mitochondrial proton-transporting ATP synthase complex", "inorganic anion transport", and other terms related to eggshell calcification and cuticularization. Through integrated analysis, we found that some important genes such as FGF14, COL25A1, GPX8, and GRXCR1 and their corresponding lncRNAs were expressed differentially between two groups, and the results of quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) among these genes were also in excellent agreement with the sequencing data. In addition, our study found that TCONS_00181492, TCONS_03234147, and TCONS_03123639 in the uterus of laying hens caused deterioration of eggshell quality in the late laying period by up-regulating their corresponding target genes FGF14, COL25A1, and GRXCR1 as well as down-regulating the target gene GPX8 by TCONS_01464392. Our findings will provide a valuable reference for the development of breeding programs aimed at breeding excellent poultry with high eggshell quality or regulating dietary nutrient levels to improve eggshell quality.
