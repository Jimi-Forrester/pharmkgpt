28234631|t|DTI measurements for Alzheimer's classification.
28234631|a|Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a promising imaging technique that provides insight into white matter microstructure integrity and it has greatly helped identifying white matter regions affected by Alzheimer's disease (AD) in its early stages. DTI can therefore be a valuable source of information when designing machine-learning strategies to discriminate between healthy control (HC) subjects, AD patients and subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Nonetheless, several studies have reported so far conflicting results, especially because of the adoption of biased feature selection strategies. In this paper we firstly analyzed DTI scans of 150 subjects from the Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) database. We measured a significant effect of the feature selection bias on the classification performance (p-value  <  0.01), leading to overoptimistic results (10% up to 30% relative increase in AUC). We observed that this effect is manifest regardless of the choice of diffusion index, specifically fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity. Secondly, we performed a test on an independent mixed cohort consisting of 119 ADNI scans; thus, we evaluated the informative content provided by DTI measurements for AD classification. Classification performances and biological insight, concerning brain regions related to the disease, provided by cross-validation analysis were both confirmed on the independent test.
