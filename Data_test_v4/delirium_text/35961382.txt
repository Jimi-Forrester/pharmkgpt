35961382|a|Accelerated Long-term Forgetting (ALF) is a memory deficit characterised by normal retention up to relatively short intervals (e.g., minutes, hours) with increased forgetting over longer periods (e.g., days, weeks). ALF is often underestimated due to a lack of common memory assessments beyond 30-60 min. The purpose of this review was to provide an overview of ALF occurrence in neurodegenerative disorders, evaluating whether it can be considered a cognitive deficit useful for diagnosing and monitoring patients. We included 19 experimental studies that investigated ALF in neurodegenerative disorders. Most papers were focused on Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia and related forms of cognitive decline (Mild Cognitive Impairment, Subjective Cognitive decline, Pre-symptomatic subjects at risk of AD dementia). The major finding of the present work concerns the presence of ALF in very early forms of cognitive decline related to AD. These findings, supporting the hypothesis that ALF is a subtle and undetected hallmark of pre-clinical AD, highlights the importance of investigating forgetting over a longer period and devising standardised measures to be included in clinical practice.
