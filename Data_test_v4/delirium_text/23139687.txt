23139687|a|BACKGROUND/AIMS: According to experimental data, a transdermal application is preferred by caregivers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients compared with oral medications. The AXEPT study compared compliance to treatment among community-dwelling patients with mild-to-moderate AD treated with transdermal application compared to oral medications and caregiver satisfaction in a real clinical setting. METHODS: Data from 45 memory clinics in Italy were collected between September 8, 2010 and January 31, 2011. Compliance to treatment and caregiver satisfaction were measured using the Caregiver Medication Interview. RESULTS: A total of 855 AD patients and their caregivers participated in the study. Nearly 80% of caregivers of patients on patch were not concerned about adherence to treatment compared with 64% of caregivers of patients on oral drugs. Among caregivers of patients on patch, 94% did not report any difficulties in remembering to administer treatment compared with 73% of caregivers of patients on oral medications. The highest level of compliance and satisfaction was reported by caregivers of patients on transdermal application. CONCLUSION: Caregivers of patients treated with a transdermal application appeared to be more satisfied and reported a higher level of compliance than caregivers of patients receiving anti-AD oral medications.
