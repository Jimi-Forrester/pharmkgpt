32118475|t|Elevated age-related cortical iron, ferritin and amyloid plaques in APP(swe)/PS1(deltaE9) transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
32118475|a|Iron is very important element for functioning of the brain. Its concentration changes with aging the brain or during disease. The aim of our work was the histological examination of content of ferritin and free iron (unbound) in brain cortex in association with Abeta plaques from their earliest stages of accumulation in amyloid plaque forming APP/PS1 transgenic mice. Light microscopy revealed the onset of plaques formation at 8-monthage. Detectable traces of free iron and no ferritin were found around plaques at this age, while the rate of their accumulation in and around Abeta plaques was elevated at 13 months of age. Ferritin accumulated mainly on the edge of Abeta plaques, while the smaller amount of free iron was observed in the plaque-free tissue, as well as in and around Abeta plaques. We conclude that free iron and ferritin accumulation follows the amyloid plaques formation. Quantification of cortical iron and ferritin content can be an important marker in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.
