37541457|a|This study aimed to determine the pattern of fractional dimension (FD) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, and investigate the relationship between FD and the locus coeruleus (LC) signal intensity.A total of 27 patients with AD and 25 healthy controls (HC) were collected to estimate the pattern of fractional dimension (FD) and cortical thickness (CT) using the Computational Anatomy Toolbox (CAT12), and statistically analyze between groups on a vertex level using statistical parametric mapping 12. In addition, they were examined by neuromelanin sensitive MRI(NM-MRI) technique to calculate the locus coeruleus signal contrast ratios (LC-CRs). Additionally, correlations between the pattern of FD and LC-CRs were further examined.Compared to HC, AD patients showed widespread lower CT and FD Furthermore, significant positive correlation was found between local fractional dimension (LFD) of the left rostral middle frontal cortex and LC-CRs. Results suggest lower cortical LFD is associated with LCCRs that may reflect a reduction due to broader neurodegenerative processes. This finding may highlight the potential utility for advanced measures of cortical complexity in assessing brain health and early identification of neurodegenerative processes.
