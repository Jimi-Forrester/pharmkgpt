31948064|t|Bovine Serum Albumin Protein-Based Liquid Crystal Biosensors for Optical Detection of Toxic Heavy Metals in Water.
31948064|a|A new methodology involving the use of Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) as a probe and liquid crystal (LC) as a signal reporter for the detection of heavy metal ions in water at neutral pH was developed. BSA acted as a multi-dentate ligand for the detection of multiple metal ions. The LC sensor was fabricated by immobilizing 3 microg mL-1 BSA solution on dimethyloctadecyl-[3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl]ammonium chloride (DMOAP)-coated glass slides. In the absence of heavy metal ions, a dark optical image was observed, while in their presence, a dark optical image turned to bright. The optical response was characterized by using a polarized optical microscope (POM). The BSA based LC sensor selectively detected toxic metal ions as compared to s block metal ions and ammonium ions in water. Moreover, the limit of detection was found to be very low (i.e., 1 nM) for the developed new biosensor in comparison to reported biosensors.
