35242450|a|Lymphomas of the central nervous system (CNS) are broadly classified into primary CNS lymphoma (PCNSL) and secondary CNS lymphoma (SCNSL). PCNSL refers to lymphoma restricted to the brain, leptomeninges, spinal cord, or eyes without evidence of it outside the CNS at primary diagnosis, while SCNSL refers to secondary CNS involvement by systemic lymphoma. The brain is the most common site of involvement and intracranial CNS lymphoma has a highly variable imaging appearance and varies according to the patient's clinical profile and immunity. This pictorial essay aims to illustrate the different facets of intracranial CNS lymphomas on neuroimaging. This enables radiologists to be familiarized with their key diagnostic features and differentiate from their differential diagnoses, leading to early diagnosis, and treatment.
