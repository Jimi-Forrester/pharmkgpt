37371103|t|HnRNP Pathologies in Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration.
37371103|a|Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is the second most common form of young-onset (<65 years) dementia. Clinically, it primarily manifests as a disorder of behavioural, executive, and/or language functions. Pathologically, frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is the predominant cause of FTD. FTLD is a proteinopathy, and the main pathological proteins identified so far are tau, TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43), and fused in sarcoma (FUS). As TDP-43 and FUS are members of the heterogeneous ribonucleic acid protein (hnRNP) family, many studies in recent years have expanded the research on the relationship between other hnRNPs and FTLD pathology. Indeed, these studies provide evidence for an association between hnRNP abnormalities and FTLD. In particular, several studies have shown that multiple hnRNPs may exhibit nuclear depletion and cytoplasmic mislocalisation within neurons in FTLD cases. However, due to the diversity and complex association of hnRNPs, most studies are still at the stage of histological discovery of different hnRNP abnormalities in FTLD. We herein review the latest studies relating hnRNPs to FTLD. Together, these studies outline an important role of multiple hnRNPs in the pathogenesis of FTLD and suggest that future research into FTLD should include the whole spectrum of this protein family.
