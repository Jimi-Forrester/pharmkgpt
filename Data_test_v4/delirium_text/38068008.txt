38068008|t|Adverse Effects of Non-Metallic Nanoparticles in the Central Nervous System.
38068008|a|The interest in nanoparticles (NPs) and their effects on living organisms has been continuously growing in the last decades. A special interest is focused on the effects of NPs on the central nervous system (CNS), which seems to be the most vulnerable to their adverse effects. Non-metallic NPs seem to be less toxic than metallic ones; thus, the application of non-metallic NPs in medicine and industry is growing very fast. Hence, a closer look at the impact of non-metallic NPs on neural tissue is necessary, especially in the context of the increasing prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge of the in vitro and in vivo neurotoxicity of non-metallic NPs, as well as the mechanisms associated with negative or positive effects of non-metallic NPs on the CNS.
