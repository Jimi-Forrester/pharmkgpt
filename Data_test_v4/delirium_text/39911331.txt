39911331|t|Zn(ii)-driven impact of monomeric transthyretin on amyloid-beta amyloidogenesis.
39911331|a|Extracellular accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides in the brain plays a significant role in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). While the co-localization and interaction of proteins and metal ions with Abeta in extracellular milieu are established, their precise pathological associations remain unclear. Here we report the impact of Zn(ii) on the anti-amyloidogenic properties of monomeric transthyretin (M-TTR), which coexists spatially with Abeta and Zn(ii) in extracellular fluids. Our findings demonstrate the Zn(ii)-promoted ternary complex formation involving M-TTR, Abeta, and Zn(ii) as well as M-TTR's proteolytic activity towards Abeta. These interactions decrease the inhibitory effect of M-TTR on the primary nucleation process of Abeta as well as its ability to improve cell viability upon treatment of Abeta. This study unveils the variable activities of M-TTR towards Abeta, driven by Zn(ii), providing insights into how metal ions influence the entanglement of M-TTR in the Abeta-related pathology linked to AD.
