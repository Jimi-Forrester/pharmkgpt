37365525|t|LC-MS metabolomics profiling of Salvia aegyptiaca L. and S. lanigera Poir. with the antimicrobial properties of their extracts.
37365525|a|BACKGROUND: Salvia L. (Lamiaceae) found in almost all countries in temperate and tropical regions. Both S. aegyptiaca L. and S. lanigera Poir. have a rather wide distribution in Egypt (Mediterranean region, Gebel Elba and nearly the whole Sinai). Salvia species showed antibacterial and antifungal activities against several groups of food microorganisms and pathogens, so they are considered as a natural foods preservatives. AIM: Investigate the phytochemical profiles of S. aegyptiaca & S. lanigera collected from their natural habitats in Egypt and test the antimicrobial activities of both species against some bacteria and fungi pathogenic strains. METHODOLOGY: In the present study, S. aegyptiaca and S. lanigera were collected from their natural habitat. Total phenolics and flavonoids contents were measured for aerial parts of both Salvia spp.. The separation and identification of the pure active materials of both Salvia sp. by using LC-MS system (UHPLC-TSQ Quantum Mass Spectrometer). The antimicrobial activities of the ethanol, water and benzene extracts of the two species were tested against different pathogenic strains and compared with the standard antimicrobial drug (Gentamycin). Antimicrobial activity was determined by using agar disk diffusion method. RESULTS: The phenolics content in S. lanigera 132.61+-6.23 mg/g and S. aegyptiaca 125.19+-4.97 mg/g, while the flavonoids content was 35.68+-1.84 and 40.63+-2.11 mg/g, respectively. Through LC-MS analysis, two compounds were detected in both species; heptadecanoyl coenzyme A, that the highest percentage (13.5%) in S. aegyptiaca and (11.5 %) in S. lanigera. Oenin, in a peak area of 3.1% in S. aegyptiaca and 1.2 % in S. lanigera. Ethanol extract of the two species had the most inhibitory effect against all tested microorganisms that exceeded the effect of the standard, except for Mucor reinelloids which was more sensitive to the water extract. Moreover, S. lanigera ethanol extract showed larger inhibition zone than S. aegyptiaca in all tested microorganisms except for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. CONCLUSION: This study shows the important phytochemicals that improve the antibacterial and antifungal activities of Salvia aegyptiaca and S. lanigera.
