35403880|a|INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS: To determine the 7-day incidence and risk factors of postoperative delirium (POD) occurring after prolapse surgery in women aged >=60 years. METHODS: A prospective study of women >=60 years undergoing prolapse surgery at a large academic center. The primary outcome is positive Confusion Assessment Method delirium screen administered in person or by telephone at the time of hospital discharge and postoperative days 1, 3, 5, and 7. RESULTS: This analysis included 165 patients, mean +- SD age of 72.5 +- 6.1 years, with median (IQR) years of education of 13 (12-16), and baseline Modified Mini-Mental Status (3MS) Exam score of 95 (92-98). Prolapse repair type was vaginal for 70% (n=115) and laparoscopic for 30% (n=50) of patients; most under general anesthesia, 151 (92.1%). The incidence of positive delirium screen during the first week after surgery was 12.1% (n=20). Most of these participants screened positive on postoperative day 0, 8.4% (n=14). In univariate analyses, a positive screen was associated with older age and fewer education years, lower 3MS exam score, greater baseline geriatric depression scale score, and greater frailty score. Lower 3MS score was the only variable that remained significant in the final model (adjusted odds ratio 0.84, 95% CI 0.75-0.95). CONCLUSIONS: One in 12 women >=60 years deemed eligible for discharge on the day of prolapse surgery screens positive for delirium. The 7-day POD incidence is comparable to other elective non-cardiac surgery cohorts. Given the increasing trend toward same day discharge after major prolapse surgery, more research is needed to determine the impact of universal delirium screening as part of discharge assessments.
