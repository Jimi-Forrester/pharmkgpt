35947293|a|The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly spread worldwide, leading to increased concerns about long-term patients' neuropsychiatric consequences. This study aims to describe the presence of depressive and anxiety symptoms in severe COVID-19 survivors and to identify associated baseline, in-hospital and post-discharge factors. This study is part of the MAPA longitudinal project conducted with severe COVID-19 patients admitted in Intensive Care Medicine Department (ICMD) of a University Hospital (CHUSJ) in Porto, Portugal. Patients with ICMD length of stay <= 24 h, terminal illness, major auditory loss or inability to communicate at follow-up assessment were excluded. All participants were assessed by telephone post-discharge (median = 101 days), with a comprehensive protocol assessing depressive and anxiety symptoms, cognition, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) memories recall and health-related quality of life. Out of a sample of 56 survivors (median age = 65; 68% males), 29% and 23% had depressive and anxiety symptoms, respectively. Depressive and anxiety symptoms were significantly more prevalent among younger survivors and were associated with cognitive complaints, emotional and delusions ICU memories and fear of having COVID-19 sequelae, sleep problems and pain after discharge (all p < 0.05). An important proportion of these survivors suffers from depression and anxiety symptoms post-discharge, namely younger ones and those who reported more cognitive complaints, ICU memories, fear of having COVID-19 sequelae, sleep problems and pain. These findings highlight the importance of psychological consequences assessment and planning of appropriate and multidisciplinary follow-up care after hospitalization due to COVID-19.
