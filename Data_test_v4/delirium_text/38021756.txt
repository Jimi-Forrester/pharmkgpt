38021756|t|Delirium in Home Care: A Case Report.
38021756|a|Delirium is a challenging medical problem, particularly in the home care setting, and greatly affects both patients and family caregivers. When delirium is not immediately detected and effectively managed, various outcomes are adversely affected. This report describes delirium in an older home-bound man and offers strategies for detecting and managing delirium in a home care setting. The patient is a frail 86-year-old man with multiple medical comorbidities and functional decline after bronchitis that was diagnosed by a general practitioner. Following the diagnosis and subsequent treatment of bronchitis, the patient suffered a major decline in cognitive and physical functioning during normal daily activities. Medical screening revealed confusion, apathy, and extreme fatigue. Using the assessment tool of the Functional Independence Measures and Delirium Observation Screening Scale (DOSS), the presence of functional decline and delirious symptoms were found. Through multidisciplinary collaboration, a treatment plan was initiated. It consisted of hydration following a fixed schedule, adapted nutrition, a temporary adapted medication schedule for pre-diabetes, and an exercise plan. No specific pharmaceuticals were given. The patient made a full recovery over time. All professional and informal caregivers should be aware of the potential presence of delirium when an older patient with a deteriorating physical or mental condition presents itself. Good diagnostics for delirium and possible underlying diseases are necessary. Adequate treatment, with the help of paramedics such as dieticians, physiotherapists, etc. must be provided when necessary.
