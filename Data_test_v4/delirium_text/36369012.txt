36369012|a|Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory infectious disease caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). COVID-19 is characterized by having a heterogeneous disease course, ranging from asymptomatic and mild symptoms to more severe and critical cases. In most cases the severity of COVID-19 is related to host factors, especially deregulation of the immune response in patients. Even if COVID-19 indiscriminately affects individuals of different age group, ethnicity and economic status; most severe cases and disproportional mortality occur in elderly individuals. This point out that aging is one risk factor for unfavourable clinical outcomes among COVID-19 patients. The biology of aging is a complex process; Aging can alter the structure and function of cells, tissues, and organs resulting in impaired response to stress. Alongside with other systems, the immune system is also affected with the aging process. Immunosenescence is an age associated change in the immune system that affects the overall response to immunological challenges in the elderly. Similarly, apart from the normal inflammatory process, aging is associated with a low grade, sterile, chronic inflammation which is termed as inflammaging. We hypothesized that inflammaging and immunosenescence could play an important role in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and poor recovery from COVID-19 in elderly individuals. This review summarizes the changes in the immune system with age and how these changes play part in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and clinical outcome of COVID-19 which could add to the understanding of age associated targeted immunotherapy in the elderly.
