37655621|t|Microfluidic organotypic device to test intestinal mucosal barrier permeability ex vivo.
37655621|a|To protect the body from external pathogens, the intestines have sophisticated epithelial and mucosal barriers. Disruptions to barrier integrity are associated with a variety of disorders such as irritable bowel disease, Crohn's disease, and celiac disease. One critical component of all barriers are collagens in the extracellular matrix. While the importance of the intestinal barrier is established, current models lack the ability to represent the complex biology that occurs at these barriers. For the current study a microfluidic device model was modified to determine the effectiveness of collagen breakdown to cause barrier disruption. Bacterial collagenase was added for 48 h to the luminal channel of a dual flow microfluidic device to examine changes in intestinal barrier integrity. Tissues exhibited dose-dependent alterations in immunoreactive collagen-1 and claudin-1, and coincident disruption of the epithelial monolayer barrier as indicated by goblet cell morphologies. This ex vivo model system offers promise for further studies exploring factors that affect gut barrier integrity and potential downstream consequences that cannot be studied in current models.
