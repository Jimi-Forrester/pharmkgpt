36140397|a|The growing number of patients affected by neurodegenerative disorders represents a huge problem for healthcare systems, human society, and economics. In this context, omics strategies are crucial for the identification of molecular factors involved in disease pathobiology, and for the discovery of biomarkers that allow early diagnosis, patients' stratification, and treatment response prediction. The integration of different omics data is a required step towards the goal of personalized medicine. The Italian proteomics community is actively developing and applying proteomics approaches to the study of neurodegenerative disorders; moreover, it is leading the mitochondria-focused initiative of the Human Proteome Project, which is particularly important given the central role of mitochondrial impairment in neurodegeneration. Here, we describe how Italian research groups in proteomics have contributed to the knowledge of many neurodegenerative diseases, through the elucidation of the pathobiology of these disorders, and through the discovery of disease biomarkers. In particular, we focus on the central role of post-translational modifications analysis, the implementation of network-based approaches in functional proteomics, the integration of different omics in a systems biology view, and the development of novel platforms for biomarker discovery for the high-throughput quantification of thousands of proteins at a time.
