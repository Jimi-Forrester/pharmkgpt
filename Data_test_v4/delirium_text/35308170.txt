35308170|t|A Review of Bile Acid Metabolism and Signaling in Cognitive Dysfunction-Related Diseases.
35308170|a|Bile acids are commonly known as one of the vital metabolites derived from cholesterol. The role of bile acids in glycolipid metabolism and their mechanisms in liver and cholestatic diseases have been well studied. In addition, bile acids also serve as ligands of signal molecules such as FXR, TGR5, and S1PR2 to regulate some physiological processes in vivo. Recent studies have found that bile acids signaling may also play a critical role in the central nervous system. Evidence showed that some bile acids have exhibited neuroprotective effects in experimental animal models and clinical trials of many cognitive dysfunction-related diseases. Besides, alterations in bile acid metabolisms well as the expression of different bile acid receptors have been discovered as possible biomarkers for prognosis tools in multiple cognitive dysfunction-related diseases. This review summarizes biosynthesis and regulation of bile acids, receptor classification and characteristics, receptor agonists and signaling transduction, and recent findings in cognitive dysfunction-related diseases.
