38106655|t|Identification of high-performing antibodies for Moesin for use in Western Blot, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence.
38106655|a|Moesin is a cytoskeletal adaptor protein, involved in the modification of the actin cytoskeleton, with relevance to Alzheimer's Disease. Well characterized anti-Moesin antibodies would benefit the scientific community. In this study, we have characterized ten Moesin commercial antibodies in Western Blot, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence using a standardized experimental protocol based on comparing read-outs in knockout cell lines and isogenic parental controls. These studies are part of a larger, collaborative initiative seeking to address antibody reproducibility by characterizing commercially available antibodies for human proteins and publishing the results openly as a resource for the scientific community. While use of antibodies and protocols vary between laboratories, we encourage readers to use this report as a guide to select the most appropriate antibodies for their specific needs.
