35900911|t|Hearing Health Perceptions and Literacy Among Primary Healthcare Providers in the United States: A National Cross-Sectional Survey.
35900911|a|OBJECTIVE: To characterize current awareness, perceptions, and literacy surrounding hearing loss among United States primary healthcare professionals. STUDY DESIGN: National cross-sectional survey study. SETTING: United States. PARTICIPANTS: Four hundred six healthcare professionals. RESULTS: Survey respondents included 205 primary care physicians and 201 nurse practitioners or physician assistants. When compared with 10 other common health conditions, only 1% of respondents ranked hearing loss as a "most important" health condition to manage. Less than half of providers reported recommending hearing testing for their patients at least once per year, whereas evaluation of blood pressure, total cholesterol, body mass index, and blood glucose levels are recommended at least annually by more than 80% of providers. Although 95% of respondents indicated that it is somewhat important or very important for patients to know the standard definition for normal hearing, only 57% of surveyed providers know of a standard definition themselves, and only 28% reported familiarity with the concept of "20/20 hearing." Conversely, more than 80% of respondents know the "normal" metric for blood pressure, total cholesterol, body mass index, blood glucose, and vision. Most respondents realize that hearing is important to overall health and hearing loss can impact personal safety, lead to social isolation, and negatively impact quality of life. Fifty-four percent also acknowledged a link between hearing loss and depression, but a majority were not very aware of the relationship of hearing loss to risk of falling and dementia, reduced income and job opportunities, and type 2 diabetes. Importantly, only 40% of providers believe hearing loss is treatable, and only 17% believe it is preventable. CONCLUSION: Despite widespread literacy of what constitutes normal blood pressure, total cholesterol, body mass index, blood glucose, and vision metrics, healthcare providers exhibit a poor understanding of normal hearing levels. Few providers prioritize hearing health or regularly recommend for annual hearing evaluation. Most providers believe that options for people with hearing loss are limited, which may have important implications for prioritizing discussion of hearing loss with patients.
