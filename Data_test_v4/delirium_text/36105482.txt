36105482|a|Amphibian skin is acknowledged to contain an antioxidant system composed of various gene-encoded antioxidant peptides, which exert significant effects on host defense. Nevertheless, recognition of such peptides is in its infancy so far. Here, we reported the antioxidant properties and underlying mechanism of a new antioxidant peptide, brevinin-1FL, identified from Fejervarya limnocharis frog skin. The cDNA sequence encoding brevinin-1FL was successfully cloned from the total cDNA of F. limnocharis and showed to contain 222 bp. The deduced mature peptide sequence of brevinin-1FL was FWERCSRWLLN. Functional analysis revealed that brevinin-1FL could concentration-dependently scavenge ABTS+, DPPH, NO, and hydroxyl radicals and alleviate iron oxidation. Besides, brevinin-1FL was found to show neuroprotective activity by reducing contents of MDA and ROS plus mitochondrial membrane potential, increasing endogenous antioxidant enzyme activity, and suppressing H2O2-induced death, apoptosis, and cycle arrest in PC12 cells which were associated with its regulation of AKT/MAPK/NF-kappaB signal pathways. Moreover, brevinin-1FL relieved paw edema, decreased the levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, MPO, and malondialdehyde (MDA), and restored catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity plus glutathione (GSH) contents in the mouse injected by carrageenan. Together, these findings indicate that brevinin-1FL as an antioxidant has potent therapeutic potential for the diseases induced by oxidative damage. Meanwhile, this study will help us further comprehend the biological functions of amphibian skin and the mechanism by which antioxidants protect cells from oxidative stress.
