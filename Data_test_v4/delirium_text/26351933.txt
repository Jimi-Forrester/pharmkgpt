26351933|a|The importance of lipids in the understanding of disease states is constantly increasing. Whilst the link between metabolic disorders and lipids seems to be clear, interpreting lipid regulation in the context of neuropsychiatric disorders is a new approach. Mental disorders account for almost 15% of the total global disease burden with Alzheimer's disease, depression or schizophrenia being amongst the most widespread mental disorders in the general population. For this reason rapid and early diagnosis is crucial and finding the right biomarkers is of great importance. Lipids appear to be essential in learning the aetiopathology of neuropsychiatric diseases as well as in biomarker research as they are most abundantly present in the brain. This study discusses recent findings in neuropsychiatry in the context of lipid analysis.
