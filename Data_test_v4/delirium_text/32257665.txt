32257665|t|Triazolam-induced Mania in a Patient with Bipolar I Disorder Following a Dental Procedure.
32257665|a|Dental appointments and procedures may induce anxiety in some patients, which may ultimately lead to nonadherence and detrimental long-term effects. Often times, dentists prescribe short-acting benzodiazepines (triazolam) to alleviate anxiety during the duration of the procedure. However, benzodiazepines can cause adverse effects such as delirium and psychosis, which can be exacerbated by their interaction with previously prescribed medications and in those with mental health conditions. Our patient, a 60-year-old Caucasian female, with stable bipolar I disorder presented to the inpatient psychiatric unit with psychotic features and was diagnosed with substance-induced mania secondary to the administration of triazolam by her dentist for upcoming procedures. The patient's symptomatology resolved upon stabilization, and she was transferred to outpatient psychiatry for continued management.
