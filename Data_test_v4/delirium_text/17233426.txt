17233426|a|It is reported that the common psychiatric disorders among cancer patients are adjustment disorder, major depression, and delirium. Pharmacotherapy is often provided for management of these distressing symptoms. Antianxiety drugs, especially benzodiazepines, are often used for ameliorating adjustment disorder. Among them, shorter-acting benzodiazepines are usually preferred. Several randomized clinical trials indicate the efficacy of antidepressants for management of major depression experienced by cancer patients. Because there are no significant differences of effectiveness among available antidepressants, it is recommended that selection of antidepressant should depend on its adverse event profiles. Although the principal management strategies of delirium are detection and treatment of underlying causes of delirium, concurrent pharmacotherapy as symptomatic treatment is often needed. Neuroleptics, especially haloperidol, are most widely used for management of delirium.
