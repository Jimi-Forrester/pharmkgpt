21952557|t|Copper inducing Abeta42 rather than Abeta40 nanoscale oligomer formation is the key process for Abeta neurotoxicity.
21952557|a|Copper is known to be a critical factor in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis, as it is involved in amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide related toxicity. However, the relationship between neurotoxicity and Abeta peptide in the presence of copper remains unclear. The effect of copper has not been clearly differentiated between Abeta42 and Abeta40, and it is still debated whether copper-mediated neurotoxicity is due to reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation or other molecular mechanisms. Here, we describe that copper dramatically affects Abeta42 aggregation and enhances Abeta42 cytotoxicity while it shows no significant effects on Abeta40. These phenomena are mainly because that the strong interactions between copper and Abeta42 lead to great conformation changes, and stabilize Abeta42 aggregates at highly toxic nanoscale oligomer stage, whereas copper shows no similar impact on Abeta40. We also propose a possible molecular mechanism that copper enhances Abeta42 cytotoxicity via perturbing membrane structure. Moreover, we test the effect of an analogue of copper, nickel, on Abeta aggregation and cytotoxicity, finding that nickel also enhances cytotoxicity via Abeta42 nanoscale oligomer formation. These results clarify that the copper-induced Abeta42 nanoscale oligomer formation is the key process for Abeta neurotoxicity, and suggest that disrupting the interactions between copper and Abeta42 peptide to inhibit nanoscale oligomerization process, deserves more attention in AD drug development.
