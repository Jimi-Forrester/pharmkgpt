12905860|a|OBJECTIVE: To analyse the association of apolipoprotein E genotypes with Alzheimer's disease in Chinese population. METHODS: Using PCR and restriction enzyme digestion, we have analyzed ApoE allele frequency of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and healthy controls. RESULTS: Among the 56 cases of AD, the frequency of ApoE epsilon 2, ApoE epsilon 3, ApoE epsilon 4 are 3 (2.7%), 84 (75.0%), 25 (22.3%) respectively, while in the 67 controls they are 9 (6.7%), 115 (85.8%), 10 (7.5%) respectively. The frequencies of the two groups have significant difference (P < 0.01) and the frequency of ApoE epsilon 4 allele is higher in AD than that in the health controls and the statistical treatment suggest that there is significant difference (chi 2 = 10.99, P < 0.01, OR = 3.59, 95% CI = 1.54-8.41). The frequency of the ApoE epsilon 3 is lower in AD than that in the health controls and the difference is also statistically significant(P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our results are consistent with previous work in that proving the ApoE epsilon 4 allele is one of the risk factors of AD. The results also provide a support for the protection effect of ApoE epsilon 3 allele in developing AD.
