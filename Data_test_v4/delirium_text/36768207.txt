36768207|t|Genome-Wide Identification and Expression Analysis of UBiA Family Genes Associated with Abiotic Stress in Sunflowers (Helianthus annuus L.).
36768207|a|The UBiA genes encode a large class of isopentenyltransferases, which are involved in the synthesis of secondary metabolites such as chlorophyll and vitamin E. They performed important functions in the whole plant's growth and development. Current studies on UBiA genes were not comprehensive enough, especially for sunflower UBiA genes. In this study, 10 HaUBiAs were identified by domain analysis these HaUBiAs had five major conserved domains and were unevenly distributed on six chromosomes. By constructing phylogenetic trees, 119 UBiA genes were found in 12 species with different evolutionary levels and divided into five major groups, which contained seven conserved motifs and eight UBiA subsuper family domains. Tissue expression analysis showed that HaUBiAs were highly expressed in the roots, leaves, and seeds. By using promoter analysis, the cis-elements of UBiA genes were mainly in hormone signaling and stress responses. The qRT-PCR results showed that HaUBiA1 and HaUBiA5 responded strongly to abiotic stresses. Under ABA and MeJA treatments, HaUBiA1 significantly upregulated, while HaUBiA5 significantly decreased. Under cold stress, the expression of UBiA1 was significantly upregulated in the roots and stems, while UBiA5 expression was increased only in the leaves. Under anaerobic induction, UBiA1 and UBiA5 were both upregulated in the roots, stems and leaves. In summary, this study systematically classified the UBiA family and identified two abiotic stress candidate genes in the sunflower. It expands the understanding of the UBiA family and provides a theoretical basis for future abiotic stress studies in sunflowers.
