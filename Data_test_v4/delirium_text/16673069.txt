16673069|a|The public health of our society is challenged by a continuous increase in life expectancy. Hence, biomedical aging research is enjoying a steadily increasing popularity but also enlightens our understanding of age-related diseases by a number of striking results from basic research. One of the most striking changes that occurs during normal human aging is an overall diminution of immune functions, a phenomenon often termed immunosenescence. Starting from some highly exciting examples from basic immunological research, this article sheds light on which impact normal human aging has on several immune defence mechanisms. In addition, clinical consequences in view of Alzheimer's disease, immunogenicity of vaccines and autoimmune diseases are discussed.
