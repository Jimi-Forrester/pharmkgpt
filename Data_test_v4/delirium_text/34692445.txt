34692445|t|Practical Considerations for Dexmedetomidine Sedation in Adult Cataract Surgery Under Local/Regional Anesthesia: A Narrative Review.
34692445|a|Cataract surgery is predominantly performed under local/regional anesthesia, with or without sedation. The practice pattern of sedation is unknown and seems to vary significantly among institutions and countries, routinely administered in some parts of the world to the other extreme of none at all. The selection of sedative agents and techniques varies widely. Currently, there is no ideal sedative agent. Dexmedetomidine has gained recent attention for sedation in ophthalmic local/regional anesthesia due to its alleged advantages of effective sedation with minimal respiratory depression, decreased intraocular pressure, and reduced pain during the local anesthetic injection; however, they are subject to differing interpretations. Published literature also suggests that although dexmedetomidine sedation for cataract surgery under local/regional anesthesia is potentially useful, its role may be limited due to logistical difficulties in administering the recommended dose.
