35854747|t|Physician Experience Design (PXD): More Usable Machine Learning Prediction for Clinical Decision Making.
35854747|a|Delirium is an acute neurocognitive disorder, which is difficult to identify and predict. Using GEMINI, Canada's largest hospital data and analytics study, we had a labeled sample of around 4,000 cases with approximately 25% of cases being labeled as having delirium. Based on this labeled data, we developed machine learning (ML) models and interacted with physicians to interpret the ML models and their predictions. We developed a preliminary Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) framework for physician experience design (PXD) to improve the uptake of ML models by improving the transparency of model results, thereby increasing physician trust in models as well as the uptake of model results for clinical decision making. We developed our PXD approach first with Conceptual Investigation to collect and extract physicians' feedback on ML models and their evaluation requirements. We carried out a case study, working closely with the physicians in a participatory design process to develop a dashboard that presents ML delirium identification results interactively based on physician selections and inputs. In this approach a physician-preferred ML model for clinical decision making is selected through PXD evaluation.
