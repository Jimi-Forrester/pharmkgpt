37121932|t|CSF metabolomics alterations after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage: what do we know?
37121932|a|PURPOSE: The purpose of this mini review is to describe metabolomics in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and its potential in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). In brain injury, patients' micro dialysis enables detecting biochemical change in brain tissue. Indicators for ischemia were detected such as lactate, pyruvate, glucose, and glutamate. In aSAH patients, the pathophysiology and the factor for poor outcome are not completely understood yet. Routine use of biomarkers in CSF, particularly in aSAH patients, is still lacking. METHODS: This mini review was performed on the role of metabolomics alterations after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. RESULTS: We identified five clinical studies that addressed metabolomics in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. CONCLUSION: There is increasing evidence suggesting that biomarkers can give insight in the pathogenesis and can serve as an outcome predictor. In this mini review, we present a brief overview of metabolomics profiling in neuroscience and wish to discuss the predictive and therapeutic value in aSAH patients.
