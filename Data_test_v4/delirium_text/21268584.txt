21268584|t|A kinetic aggregation assay allowing selective and sensitive amyloid-beta quantification in cells and tissues.
21268584|a|The process of amyloid-beta (Abeta) fibril formation is genetically and pathologically linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Thus, a selective and sensitive method for quantifying Abeta fibrils in complex biological samples allows a variety of hypotheses to be tested. Herein, we report the basis for a quantitative in vitro kinetic aggregation assay that detects seeding-competent Abeta aggregates in mammalian cell culture media, in Caenorhabditis elegans lysate, and in mouse brain homogenate. Sonicated, proteinase K-treated Abeta fibril-containing tissue homogenates or cell culture media were added to an initially monomeric Abeta(1-40) reporter peptide to seed an in vitro nucleated aggregation reaction. The reduction in the half-time (t(50)) of the amyloid growth phase is proportional to the quantity of seeding-competent Abeta aggregates present in the biological sample. An ion-exchange resin amyloid isolation strategy from complex biological samples is demonstrated as an alternative for improving the sensitivity and linearity of the kinetic aggregation assay.
