35275952|t|Midlife alcohol consumption and later life cognitive impairment: Light drinking is not protective and APOE genotype does not change this relationship.
35275952|a|INTRODUCTION: Much debate exists about the role of light to moderate alcohol intake and subsequent cognitive function. The apolipoprotein E genotype may modify the relationship. METHODS: Using data from the Honolulu-Asia Aging Study, a longitudinal population-based cohort (n = 2,416), Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were performed to measure midlife alcohol intake (average age = 52 years) and later life cognitive function (average age = 87 years) and to explore the role of apolipoprotein E genotype. RESULTS: No protective effect of light drinking (>1 drink/month- 1 drink/day) or moderate drinking (>1-2 drinks/day) was observed in the cohort in adjusted models (HR = 1.013, CI:0.88-1.16; HR = 1.104, CI:0.91-1.34, respectively). Heavy drinking (>2-4 drinks/day) and very heavy drinking (>4 drinks/day) increased the risk for incident moderate cognitive impairment (HR = 1.355, CI:1.09-1.68; HR = 1.462, CI:1.04-2.05, respectively). When examining the relationship by apolipoprotein E epsilon4 carrier status, a similar dose-response pattern was observed in both groups with higher hazard ratios for those carrying at least one copy of the apolipoprotein E E4 allele. As alcohol level increased, the age at incident moderate cognitive impairment decreased, especially among those with at least one apolipoprotein E E4 allele. DISCUSSION: We did not observe a significant protective effect for light to moderate drinking in midlife and subsequent cognitive impairment in this cohort. Heavy drinking increased the risk for moderate cognitive impairment and decreased the age at incidence, as did carrying at least one allele of the apolipoprotein E E4 gene.
