21375782|a|BACKGROUND: Several lines of evidence indicate that memory loss represents a synaptic failure caused by soluble amyloid beta (Abeta) oligomers. However, the pathological relevance of Abeta oligomers (AbetaOs) as the trigger of synaptic or neuronal degeneration, and the possible mechanism underlying the neurotoxic action of endogenous AbetaOs remain to be determined. RESULTS: To specifically target toxic AbetaOs in vivo, monoclonal antibodies (1A9 and 2C3) specific to them were generated using a novel design method. 1A9 and 2C3 specifically recognize soluble AbetaOs larger than 35-mers and pentamers on Blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, respectively. Biophysical and structural analysis by atomic force microscopy (AFM) revealed that neurotoxic 1A9 and 2C3 oligomeric conformers displayed non-fibrilar, relatively spherical structure. Of note, such AbetaOs were taken up by neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) cell, resulted in neuronal death. In humans, immunohistochemical analysis employing 1A9 or 2C3 revealed that 1A9 and 2C3 stain intraneuronal granules accumulated in the perikaryon of pyramidal neurons and some diffuse plaques. Fluoro Jade-B binding assay also revealed 1A9- or 2C3-stained neurons, indicating their impending degeneration. In a long-term low-dose prophylactic trial using active 1A9 or 2C3 antibody, we found that passive immunization protected a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) from memory deficits, synaptic degeneration, promotion of intraneuronal AbetaOs, and neuronal degeneration. Because the primary antitoxic action of 1A9 and 2C3 occurs outside neurons, our results suggest that extracellular AbetaOs initiate the AD toxic process and intraneuronal AbetaOs may worsen neuronal degeneration and memory loss. CONCLUSION: Now, we have evidence that HMW-AbetaOs are among the earliest manifestation of the AD toxic process in mice and humans. We are certain that our studies move us closer to our goal of finding a therapeutic target and/or confirming the relevance of our therapeutic strategy.
