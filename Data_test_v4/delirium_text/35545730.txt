35545730|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia and cognitive impairment; yet, there is currently no treatment. A buildup of Abeta, tau protein phosphorylation, oxidative stress, and inflammation in AD is pathogenic. The accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides in these neurocognitive areas is a significant characteristic of the disease. Therefore, inhibiting Abeta peptide aggregation has been proposed as the critical therapeutic approach for AD treatment. Resveratrol has been demonstrated in multiple studies to have a neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant characteristic and the ability to minimize Abeta peptides aggregation and toxicity in the hippocampus of Alzheimer's patients, stimulating neurogenesis and inhibiting hippocampal degeneration. Furthermore, resveratrol's antioxidant effect promotes neuronal development by activating the silent information regulator-1 (SIRT1), which can protect against the detrimental effects of oxidative stress. Resveratrol-induced SIRT1 activation is becoming more crucial in developing novel therapeutic options for AD and other diseases that have neurodegenerative characteristics. This review highlighted a better knowledge of resveratrol's mechanism of action and its promising therapeutic efficacy in treating AD. We also highlighted the therapeutic potential of resveratrol as an AD therapeutic agent, which is effective against neurodegenerative disorders.
