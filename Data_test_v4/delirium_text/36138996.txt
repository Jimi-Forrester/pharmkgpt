36138996|t|Enhanced Short-Term Memory Function in Older Adults with Dementia Following Music-Feedback Physical Training: A Pilot Study.
36138996|a|Prior research demonstrates that music making, physical exercise, and social activity have unique, positive effects on cognition and mood. One intervention, "Jymmin ", was developed incorporating these approaches and found effective for decreased pain perception and increased endurance, self-efficacy, mood, and muscle efficiency. Previously, Jymmin was not piloted with older adults with dementia. The current study is a randomized pilot study of the Jymmin  with an older adult population in a long-term care facility (n = 38), evaluated across dementia levels (mild, moderate, or severe). Results found significant improvements in scores on a confrontation naming task across all conditions (p = 0.047) and a significant interaction effect for short-term memory scores (p = 0.046), suggesting higher scores at Time 2 for the experimental group and at Time 3 for the control group. There were no significant changes in mood ratings. Findings are discussed in the context of neural activity and musical agency.
