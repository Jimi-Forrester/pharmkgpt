38028495|t|Unveiling the nexus of postoperative fever and delirium in cardiac surgery: identifying predictors for enhanced patient care.
38028495|a|Background: Postoperative delirium (POD) is a significant complication observed in cardiac surgery patients, characterized by acute cognitive decline, fluctuating mental status, consciousness impairment, and confusion. Despite its impact, POD often goes undiagnosed. Postoperative fever, a common occurrence after cardiac surgery, has not been comprehensively studied in relation to delirium. This study aims to identify perioperative period factors associated with POD in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass, with the potential for implementing preventive interventions. Methods: In a prospective observational study conducted between February 2023 and April 2023 at the Department of Cardio-Thoracic Surgery, Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital, Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, a total of 232 patients who underwent cardiac surgery were enrolled. POD assessment utilized the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU), while high fever was defined as a bladder temperature exceeding 39 C. Statistical analysis included univariate and multivariate analyses, logistic regression, nomogram development, and internal validation. Result: The overall incidence of postoperative delirium was found to be 12.1%. Multivariate analysis revealed that postoperative lactate levels [odds ratio (OR) = 1.787], maximum temperature (OR = 11.290), and cardiopulmonary bypass time (OR = 1.015) were independent predictors of POD. A predictive nomogram for POD was developed based on these three factors, demonstrating good discrimination and calibration. The prediction model exhibited a C-statistic value of 0.852 (95% CI, 0.763-0.941), demonstrating excellent discriminatory power. Sensitivity and specificity, based on the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve, were 91.2% and 67.9%, respectively. Conclusion: This study underscores the high prevalence of POD in cardiac surgery patients and identifies postoperative lactate levels, cardiopulmonary bypass duration, and postoperative fever as independent predictors of delirium. The association between postoperative fever and POD warrants further investigation. These findings have implications for implementing preventive strategies in high-risk patients, aiming to mitigate postoperative complications and improve patient outcomes.
