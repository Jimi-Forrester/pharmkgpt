1903014|t|Immunoelectron microscopic study of synaptic pathology in Alzheimer's disease.
1903014|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by an extensive loss of neurons and synapses in the neocortex which correlates strongly with psychometric tests of dementia. To characterize the ultrastructural changes in presynaptic terminals in AD, we studied biopsy material from the frontal cortex. We also examined, at the ultrastructural level, abnormal neurites scattered in the AD neuropil and in the plaque region using sections from autopsy material immunolabeled with anti-synaptophysin. We found that, regardless of amyloid deposits, some presynaptic terminals were distended and contained swollen vesicles and dense bodies. These altered synaptic organelles were similar to those found in dystrophic neurites. The latter structures displayed synaptophysin immunoreactivity, mostly localized to outer membranes of synaptic vesicles and dense bodies. The present study supports the hypothesis of progressive synaptic pathology in AD neocortex and favors the notion that the dystrophic process originates from presynaptic terminals.
