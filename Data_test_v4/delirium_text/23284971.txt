23284971|t|alpha-Synuclein and anti-alpha-synuclein antibodies in Parkinson's disease, atypical Parkinson syndromes, REM sleep behavior disorder, and healthy controls.
23284971|a|alpha-synuclein is thought to play a key role in Parkinson's disease (PD) because it is the major protein in Lewy bodies, and because its gene mutations, duplication, and triplication are associated with early-onset PD. There are conflicting reports as to whether serum and plasma concentrations of alpha-synuclein and anti-alpha-synuclein antibodies differ between PD and control subjects. The objectives of this study were to compare the levels of alpha-synuclein and its antibodies between individuals with typical PD (n=14), atypical Parkinson syndromes (n=11), idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (n=10), and healthy controls (n=9), to assess the strength of association between these serum proteins, and to determine group sizes needed for a high probability (80% power) of detecting statistical significance for 25% or 50% differences between typical PD and control subjects for these measurements. Analysis of log-transformed data found no statistically significant differences between groups for either alpha-synuclein or its antibodies. The concentrations of these proteins were weakly correlated (Spearman rho=0.16). In subjects with typical PD and atypical Parkinson syndromes, anti-alpha-synuclein antibody levels above 1.5 microg/ml were detected only in subjects with no more than four years of clinical disease. Power analysis indicated that 236 and 73 samples per group would be required for an 80% probability that 25% and 50% differences, respectively, in mean alpha-synuclein levels between typical PD and control subjects would be statistically significant; for anti-alpha-synuclein antibodies, 283 and 87 samples per group would be required. Our findings are consistent with those previous studies which suggested that serum concentrations of alpha-synuclein and its antibodies are not significantly altered in PD.
