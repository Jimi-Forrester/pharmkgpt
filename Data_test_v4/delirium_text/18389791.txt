18389791|a|Central nervous system (CNS) concentrates almost 10% of total zinc in the human body. Imbalances in zinc concentration are associated with numerous CNS diseases. Zinc deficiency is associated with nervous anorexia, major depression, cognitive impairment, and uncontrolled behavior. Our data reveal that plasma zinc concentration is decreased in major depression and it significantly increases following sertraline or amitriptyline treatment. Also, we found that ZnCl2 administration while inducing morphine-dependence in rats significantly decreases the symptoms of opioid-withdrawal syndrome. Recent data incriminate zinc deficit in the development of encephalopathy following severe impairment of hepatic function. On the other hand, zinc content of certain brain areas in Alzheimer disease is twice that in controls. Parkinson disease is also associated with higher zinc concentrations in the brain than normal. The ratio plasma zinc- other bivalent cations is also important for normal brain function.
