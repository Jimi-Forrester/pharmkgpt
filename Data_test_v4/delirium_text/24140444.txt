24140444|a|The anti-amyloid properties shared by several quinones inspired the design of a new series of hybrids derived from the multi-target drug candidate memoquin (1). The hybrids consist of a central benzoquinone core and a fragment taken from non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, connected through polyamine linkers. The new hybrids retain the potent anti-aggregating activity of the parent 1, while exhibiting micromolar AChE inhibitory activities. Remarkably, 2, 4, (R)-6 and (S)-6 were Abeta aggregation inhibitors even more potent than 1. The balanced amyloid/cholinesterase inhibitory profile is an added value that makes the present series of compounds promising leads against Alzheimer's disease.
