36628125|t|Governance of the clinical pathway and management of the patient suffering from epilepsy and drug-resistant epilepsy.
36628125|a|Epilepsy is a diffuse chronic neurological disease affecting around 50 million people worldwide. The diagnostic criteria by the International League against Epilepsy must be fulfilled to diagnose the disease, which is characterized by brief and transient episodes of abnormal neuronal activity involving one or both hemispheres, depending on the epilepsy type. The diagnosis of epilepsy should be properly and timely made because patients suffering from the disease are affected not only by seizure recurrence but also by epilepsy-related psychiatric and/or cognitive comorbidities that may have a huge impact with severe professional and social implications. It is of vital importance to define a specific governance model that has to be virtuously applied into the different phases of the clinical pathway of the patients with epilepsy in order to guarantee them the best model of care possible.
