39618077|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between preoperative nutritional scores and moderate-to-severe acute kidney injury (AKI) after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery and the predictive significance of nutritional indices for moderate to severe AKI. METHODS: This study retrospectively included older patients underwent CABG surgery from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) database. Nutritional scores were calculated by the Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index (GNRI) and the Prognostic Nutritional Index (PNI), respectively. Moderate-to-severe injury was determined by KDIGO criteria. Logistic regression, subgroup analysis, and restricted cubic splines were utilized to investigate the association. The predictive value was also assessed by the area under the curve (AUC), net reclassification index (NRI), and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI). RESULTS: A total of 1,007 patients were retrospectively included, of which 100 (9.9%) and 380 (37.7%) had malnutrition calculated by GNRI and PNI scores. The incidence of moderate-to-severe AKI was 524 (52.0%). After adjustment for selected risk factors, worse nutritional scores were associated with a higher incidence of moderate-to-severe AKI (PGNRI<0.001; PPNI=0.001). Integrating these indices into different base models improves their performance, as manifested by significant improvements in AUCs and NRIs (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Worse preoperative nutritional status was associated with an elevated risk of postoperative moderate-to-severe AKI. Integrating these indices into base models improve their predictive performance. These results highlight the importance of assessing nutritional status among older patients had CABG surgery.
