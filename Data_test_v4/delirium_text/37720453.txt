37720453|t|Outcomes in octogenarians following elective colorectal cancer surgery.
37720453|a|Background: Colorectal surgery in octogenarians is increasing in prevalence and good surgical outcomes have been demonstrated. However, functional status and independence remain the main patient consideration with limited data on the long-term functional outcomes. Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted for all patients aged above 80 undergoing surgery for colorectal cancer (CRC) from January 2018 to December 2019. Functional status assessment was made as part of pre- and post-operative allied health clinic appointments. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance scores were recorded. Loss of independence (LOI) was defined as the reduced capacity to perform pre-morbid activities of daily living (ADL) and requiring increased supports. Results: Forty-one patients aged 80 years or older had elective CRC resections with a median follow-up of 15 months [interquartile range (IQR): 8-20]. The median American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) score was 3 and 90.2% (37/41) of patients had an ECOG score of 0 or 1. There was no 30-day mortality and 2 (4.9%) deaths occurred within 1 year. The median Clavien-Dindo score was 1, and 2 patients (4.9%) required unplanned intensive care unit (ICU) admissions. Twelve re-hospitalizations occurred with falls being the most common reason. LOI occurred in only 2 patients (4.9%) and on multivariate regression analysis, age and pre-morbid requirement of gait aids were predictive of LOI (P=0.042 and P=0.003, respectively). Gait aids were also associated with higher Clavien-Dindo scores (P=0.057) and increased length of stay (LOS) (P=0.009). Conclusions: Patients with advanced age undergoing surgery for CRC surgery can still have good post-operative outcomes and adequate functional recovery with pre-operative optimization and appropriate post-operative supports.
