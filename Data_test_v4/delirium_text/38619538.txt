38619538|t|Coexisting atrial fibrillation and cancer: time trends and associations with mortality in a nationwide Dutch study.
38619538|a|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Coexisting atrial fibrillation (AF) and cancer challenge the management of both. The aim of the study is to comprehensively provide the epidemiology of coexisting AF and cancer. METHODS: Using Dutch nationwide statistics, individuals with incident AF (n = 320 139) or cancer (n = 472 745) were identified during the period 2015-19. Dutch inhabitants without a history of AF (n = 320 135) or cancer (n = 472 741) were matched as control cohorts by demographic characteristics. Prevalence of cancer/AF at baseline, 1-year risk of cancer/AF diagnosis, and their time trends were determined. The association of cancer/AF diagnosis with all-cause mortality among those with AF/cancer was estimated by using time-dependent Cox regression. RESULTS: The rate of prevalence of cancer in the AF cohort was 12.6% (increasing from 11.9% to 13.2%) compared with 5.6% in the controls; 1-year cancer risk was 2.5% (stable over years) compared with 1.8% in the controls [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 1.52, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.46-1.58], which was similar by cancer type. The rate of prevalence of AF in the cancer cohort was 7.5% (increasing from 6.9% to 8.2%) compared with 4.3% in the controls; 1-year AF risk was 2.8% (stable over years) compared with 1.2% in the controls (aHR 2.78, 95% CI 2.69-2.87), but cancers of the oesophagus, lung, stomach, myeloma, and lymphoma were associated with higher hazards of AF than other cancer types. Both cancer diagnosed after incident AF (aHR 7.77, 95% CI 7.45-8.11) and AF diagnosed after incident cancer (aHR 2.55, 95% CI 2.47-2.63) were associated with all-cause mortality, but the strength of the association varied by cancer type. CONCLUSIONS: Atrial fibrillation and cancer were associated bidirectionally and were increasingly coexisting, but AF risk varied by cancer type. Coexisting AF and cancer were negatively associated with survival.
