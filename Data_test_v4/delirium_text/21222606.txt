21222606|a|The objective of this study was to elucidate an association between Apo- Eepsilon4 allele and CSF biomarkers Abeta42 and tau for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) patients. Abeta42 and tau protein concentrations in CSF were measured by using ELISA assays. The levels of Abeta42 were found to be decreased where as tau levels increased in AD patients. Moreover in AD patients Apo-Eepsilon4 allele carriers have shown low Abeta42 levels (328.86 +- 99.0 pg/ml) compared to Apo-Eepsilon4 allele non-carriers (367.52 +- 5 7.37 pg/ml), while tau levels were higher in Apo-Eepsilon4 allele carriers (511 +- 44.67 pg/ml) compared to Apo-Eepsilon4 allele non-carriers (503.75 +- 41.08 pg/ml). Combination of Abeta42 and tau resulted in sensitivity of 75.38% and specificity of 94.82% and diagnostic accuracy of 84.30% for AD compared with the controls. Therefore low Abeta42 and elevated tau concentrations in CSF may prove to be a better diagnostic marker for AD along with the Apo-Eepsilon4 allele.
