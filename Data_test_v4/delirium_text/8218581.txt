8218581|t|Re-evaluation of cerebrospinal fluid angiotensin-converting enzyme activity in patients with 'probable' Alzheimer's disease.
8218581|a|Angiotensin-converting enzyme activity was measured in lumbar cerebrospinal fluid from patients with 'probable' Alzheimer's disease (n = 17) and age-matched controls (n = 19), using a spectrofluorimetric method. In contrast to a previous finding, no statistically significant difference in the mean (specific) angiotensin-converting enzyme activity was found between the two groups. No correlation existed between (specific) enzyme activity and severity of dementia in the Alzheimer's disease patients. We conclude that angiotensin-converting enzyme in cerebrospinal fluid does not appear to be useful as a potential antemortem marker for Alzheimer's disease.
