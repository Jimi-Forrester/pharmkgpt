38142924|a|In Alzheimer's disease (AD), microglia are involved in synaptic pruning and mediate synapse loss. LINGO-1 is a negative regulator of nerve growth, and whether antagonizing LINGO-1 can attenuate synaptic pruning by microglia and rescue dendritic spines in the hippocampus in AD is still unclear. On this basis, the anti-LINGO-1 antibody, which binds to LINGO-1 protein and antagonizes the effects of LINGO-1, was administered to 10-month-old APP/PS1 transgenic mice for 2 months. The Morris water maze test, immunohistochemical and stereological methods, immunofluorescence and 3D reconstruction were used. Compared to wild-type mice, APP/PS1 transgenic mice had worse performance on behavioral tests, fewer dendritic spines but more microglia in the hippocampus. Meanwhile, the microglia in APP/PS1 transgenic mice had more branches of medium length (4-6 microm) and a cell body area with greater variability. Moreover, APP/PS1 transgenic mice had more postsynaptic termini colocalized with microglia in the hippocampus than wild-type mice. The anti-LINGO-1 antibody significantly reversed these changes in AD, indicating that the anti-LINGO-1 antibody can improve hippocampus-dependent learning and memory abilities and effectively rescue dendritic spines in the hippocampus of AD mice and that microglia might participate in this progression in AD. These results provide a scientific basis for further studying the mechanism of the anti-LINGO-1 antibody in AD and help to elucidate the role of LINGO-1 in the treatment of AD.
