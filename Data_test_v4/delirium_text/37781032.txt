37781032|t|Reversing Gray Hair: Inspiring the Development of New Therapies Through Research on Hair Pigmentation and Repigmentation Progress.
37781032|a|Hair graying is a common and visible sign of aging resulting from decreased or absence of melanogenesis. Although it has been established that gray hair greatly impacts people's mental health and social life, there is no effective countermeasure other than hair dyes. It has long been thought that reversal of gray hair on a large scale is rare. However, a recent study reported that individual gray hair darkening is a common phenomenon, suggesting the possibility of large-scale reversal of gray hair. In this article, we summarize the regulation mechanism of melanogenesis and review existing cases of hair repigmentation caused by several factors, including monoclonal antibodies drugs, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), immunomodulators, other drugs, micro-injury, and tumors, and speculate on the mechanisms behind them. This review offers some insights for further research into the modulation of melanogenesis and presents a novel perspective on the development of clinical therapies, with emphasis on topical treatments.
