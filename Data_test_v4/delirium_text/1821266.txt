1821266|t|Visual evoked potentials in dementia: selective delay of flash P2 in probable Alzheimer's disease.
1821266|a|The flash visual evoked potential P2 component is delayed in etiologically mixed groups of demented patients compared to healthy controls or nondemented patients. This study compared patients meeting both DSM-III-R criteria for dementia and NINCDS-ADRDA criteria for probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) with healthy elderly controls and found the P2 delay in the probable AD group. Additional comparisons found no evidence of a P2 delay in demented unlikely AD patients. These results suggest that earlier findings of a delayed P2 in etiologically mixed demented groups may have been due to inclusion of AD patients.
