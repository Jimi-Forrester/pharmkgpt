38543856|t|A Comprehensive Review of Neurodegenerative Manifestations of SARS-CoV-2.
38543856|a|The World Health Organization reports that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has impacted a staggering 770 million individuals to date. Despite the widespread nature of this viral infection, its precise effects remain largely elusive. This scientific inquiry aims to shed light on the intricate interplay between SARS-CoV-2 infection and the development of neurodegenerative disorders-an affliction that weighs heavily on millions worldwide and stands as the fourth most prevalent cause of mortality. By comprehensively understanding the repercussions of SARS-CoV-2 on neurodegenerative disorders, we strive to unravel critical insights that can potentially shape our approach to the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of these debilitating conditions. To achieve this goal, we conducted a comprehensive literature review of the scientific data available to date showing that SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with increased risk and severity of neurodegenerative disorders, as well as altered expression of key genes and pathways involved in their pathogenesis.
