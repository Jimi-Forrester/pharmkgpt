37866941|a|Objective: To explore through big data analysis whether aberrant alternative splicing (AS) events precede tau P301S-induced neurodegenerative phenotype in 6-month-old PS19 mice. Methods: The original sequencing files of the GSE182170 dataset was downloaded from the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) database with axel, aligned to the reference genome of the ENSEMBL database by using STAR software, and common AS event analysis and visualization were performed with rMATS and rmats2sashimiplot R packages. RSEM software was utilized for gene transcript quantification, Deseq2, edgeR, and limma R packages were used for differential expression analysis, and clusterProfiler R package was applied for GO enrichment analysis. String and Cytoscape were used for protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis. Gene expression correlation analysis was performed with ggcorrplot R package. AS events were validated using PCR followed by agarose electrophoresis. Results: A total of 8 079 AS events were identified with rMATS and 117 significant AS events (DeltaPSI>0.1, sequencing coverage >1) were selected eventually. The most frequent type of AS event was skipped exon (SE) (50.43%), followed by alternative 3' splice site (A3SS) and mutually exclusive exons (MXE). GO enrichment analysis revealed that synapse organization genes were aberrantly spliced in SE events and spliceosome genes were spliced in A3SS events. PPI and correlation analyses showed that the splicing factor Snrpn was significantly associated with the largest number of transcripts. Agarose electrophoresis confirmed the aberrant AS event of the Lrp8 gene in PS19 mice. Conclusion: Dysregulated splicing factors may contribute to tau P301S-induced aberrant AS changes. The study also increases the understanding of the cycling of tau protein and splicing factors in tauopathies.
