37997948|a|The use of the DOS and Delirium Prevalence: a quantitative longitudinal study at a Swiss-German central hospital Abstract: Background: With a prevalence of 12-64%, delirium is a common complication in acute care, associated with negative outcomes such as increased mortality and prolonged length of stay. Many hospitals have guidelines to improve the delirium management. The Delirium Observation Screening Scale (DOS) Score is collected in the study hospital from all patients >= 70 years at each shift for at least 3 days. Delirium is diagnosed by a physician and coded according to ICD-10. Purpose: Evaluation of the delirium screening with the DOS according to internal guideline in terms of number of DOS assessments performed, prevalence of delirium (DOS score >= 3 points, CD-10 code delirium). Method: This retrospective quantitative single-centre longitudinal study used 2017 and 2018 data of 10046 cases. Statistical analysis methods were used to analyse prevalence of delirium and subgroup comparisons. Results: At least one DOS score was documented in 92% of cases aged >= 70-years (n = 5038). DOS implementation varied between 60% in the early, 49% in the late and 38% in the night shift. The prevalence of delirium was 12% according to DOS score >= 3 and 4% according to physician diagnosis of a delirium. Cases with a DOS score >= 3 were significantly older, more often female, had more comorbidities and were depressed. Conclusions: DOS is performed in most patients when indicated. The DOS implementation frequency varied depending on the shift.
