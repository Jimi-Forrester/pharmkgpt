36043690|a|BACKGROUND: Neurobiological research frequently implicates inflammatory and neurogenic components with core aspects of bipolar disorder. Even in periods of symptom remission (euthymia), individuals with bipolar disorder experience cognitive impairments, which are increasingly being proposed as an outcome for interventions; identifying biomarkers associated with cognitive impairment in people with bipolar disorder could advance progress in this therapeutic field through identifying biological treatment targets. AIMS: We aimed to identify proteomic biomarker correlates of cognitive impairment in individuals with euthymic bipolar disorder. METHOD: Forty-four adults with a bipolar disorder diagnosis in euthymia underwent a battery of cognitive assessments and provided blood for biomarkers. We examined a comprehensive panel of inflammatory and trophic proteins as putative cross-sectional predictors of cognition, conceptualised according to recommended definitions of clinically significant cognitive impairment (binary construct) and global cognitive performance (continuous measure). RESULTS: A total of 48% of the sample met the criteria for cognitive impairment. Adjusting for potentially important covariates, regression analyses identified lower levels of three proteins as significantly and independently associated with cognitive deficits, according to both binary and continuous definitions (interleukin-7, vascular endothelial growth factor C and placental growth factor), and one positively correlated with (continuous) global cognitive performance (basic fibroblast growth factor). CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies four candidate markers of cognitive impairment in bipolar disorder, none of which have been previously compared with cognitive function in participants with bipolar disorder. Pending replication in larger samples and support from longitudinal studies, these markers could have implications for treating cognitive dysfunction in this patient population.
