24199868|t|Single point mutations induce a switch in the molecular mechanism of the aggregation of the Alzheimer's disease associated Abeta42 peptide.
24199868|a|Single point mutations in the Alzheimer's disease associated Abeta42 peptide are found to alter significantly its neurotoxic properties in vivo and have been associated with early onset forms of this devastating condition. We show that such mutations can induce structural changes in Abeta42 fibrils and are associated with a dramatic switch in the fibril-dependent mechanism by which Abeta42 aggregates. These observations reveal how subtle perturbations to the physicochemical properties of the Abeta peptide, and the structural properties of fibrils that it forms, can have profound effects on the mechanism of its aggregation and pathogenicity.
