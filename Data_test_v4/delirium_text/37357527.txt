37357527|a|Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 virus causes novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and there is a possible role for oxidative stress in the pathophysiology of neurological diseases associated with COVID-19. Excessive oxidative stress could be responsible for the thrombosis and other neuronal dysfunctions observed in COVID-19. This review discusses the role of oxidative stress associated with SARS-CoV-2 and the mechanisms involved. Furthermore, the various therapeutics implicated in treating COVID-19 and the oxidative stress that contributes to the etiology and pathogenesis of COVID-19-induced neuronal dysfunction are discussed. Further mechanistic and clinical research to combat COVID-19 is warranted to understand the exact mechanisms, and its true clinical effects need to be investigated to minimize neurological complications from COVID-19.
