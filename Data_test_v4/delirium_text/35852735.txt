35852735|t|GA-MADRID: design and validation of a machine learning tool for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia using genetic algorithms.
35852735|a|Artificial Intelligence aids early diagnosis and development of new treatments, which is key to slow down the progress of the diseases, which to date have no cure. The patients' evaluation is carried out through diagnostic techniques such as clinical assessments neuroimaging techniques, which provide high-dimensionality data. In this work, a computational tool is presented that deals with the data provided by the clinical diagnostic techniques. This is a Python-based framework implemented with a modular design and fully extendable. It integrates (i) data processing and management of missing values and outliers; (ii) implementation of an evolutionary feature engineering approach, developed as a Python package, called PyWinEA using Mono-objective and Multi-objetive Genetic Algorithms (NSGAII); (iii) a module for designing predictive models based on a wide range of machine learning algorithms; (iv) a multiclass decision stage based on evolutionary grammars and Bayesian networks. Developed under the eXplainable Artificial Intelligence and open science perspective, this framework provides promising advances and opens the door to the understanding of neurodegenerative diseases from a data-centric point of view. In this work, we have successfully evaluated the potential of the framework for early and automated diagnosis with neuroimages and neurocognitive assessments from patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD).
