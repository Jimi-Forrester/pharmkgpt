36419201|a|INTRODUCTION: We investigated the relationship between preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers and adverse driving behaviors in a longitudinal analysis of naturalistic driving data. METHODS: Naturalistic driving data collected using in-vehicle dataloggers from 137 community-dwelling older adults (65+) were used to model driving behavior over time. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers were used to identify individuals with preclinical AD. Additionally, hippocampal volume and cognitive biomarkers for AD were investigated in exploratory analyses. RESULTS: CSF biomarkers predicted the longitudinal trajectory of the incidence of adverse driving behavior. Abnormal amyloid beta (Abeta42 /Abeta40 ) ratio was associated with an increase in adverse driving behaviors over time compared to ratios in the normal/lower range. DISCUSSION: Preclinical AD is associated with increased adverse driving behavior over time that cannot be explained by cognitive changes. Driving behavior as a functional, neurobehavioral marker may serve as an early detection for decline in preclinical AD. Screening may also help prolong safe driving as older drivers age.
