37370310|t|Cefiderocol Treatment for Severe Infections due to Difficult-to-Treat-Resistant Non-Fermentative Gram-Negative Bacilli in ICU Patients: A Case Series and Narrative Literature Review.
37370310|a|Cefiderocol (FDC) is a siderophore cephalosporin now recognized as a new weapon in the treatment of difficult-to-treat-resistant (DTR) Gram-negative pathogens, including carbapenemase-producing enterobacterales and non-fermentative Gram-negative bacilli (GNB). This article reports our experience with an FDC-based regimen in the treatment of 16 extremely severe patients (invasive mechanical ventilation, 15/16; extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, 9/16; and renal replacement therapy, 8/16) infected with DTR GNB. Our case series provides detailed insight into the pharmacokinetic profile and the microbiological data in real-life conditions. In the narrative review, we discuss the interest of FDC in the treatment of non-fermentative GNB in critically ill patients. We reviewed the microbiological spectrum, resistance mechanisms, pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics, efficacy and safety profiles, and real-world evidence for FDC. On the basis of our experience and the available literature, we discuss the optimal FDC-based regimen, FDC dosage, and duration of therapy in critically ill patients with DTR non-fermentative GNB infections.
