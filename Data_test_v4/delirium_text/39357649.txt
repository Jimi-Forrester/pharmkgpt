39357649|a|This issue of the Biomedical Journal features a special section on extracellular vesicles (EVs), covering their role in neurological diseases, viral infections, trogocytosis, allogeneic organ rejection and tolerance, as well as EV biodistribution. Two articles explore the mechanisms of Parkinson's disease, focusing on white matter and exosomes. This journal issue also examines polyomavirus-induced damage in renal transplant grafts, proposes a miRNA signature as a diagnostic biomarker for Kawasaki disease, discusses neural gating and associated brain wave alterations, and further clarifies the relationship between gut microbiota and immune checkpoint inhibitors. Additionally, the importance of therapeutic drug monitoring is reaffirmed.
