34336009|t|Ischemia-Modified Albumin: Origins and Clinical Implications.
34336009|a|Albumin is one of the most abundant proteins in the body of mammals: about 40% of its pool is located in the intravascular space and the remainder is found in the interstitial space. The content of this multifunctional protein in blood is about 60-65% of total plasma proteins. A decrease in its synthesis or changes of functional activity can destabilize oncotic blood pressure, cause a violation of transporting hormones, fatty acids, metals, and drugs. Albumin properties change under ischemic attacks associated with oxidative stress, production of reactive oxygen species, and acidosis. Under these conditions, ischemia-modified albumin (IMA) is generated that has a reduced metal-binding capacity, especially for transition metals, such as copper, nickel, and cobalt. The method of determining the cobalt-binding capability of HSA was initially proposed to evaluate IMA level and then licensed as an ACB test for routine clinical analysis for myocardial ischemia. Subsequent studies have shown the viability of the ACB test in diagnosing other diseases associated with the development of oxidative stress. This review examines recent data on IMA generation mechanisms, describes principles, advantages, and limitations of methods for evaluation of IMA levels, and provides detailed analysis of its use in diagnostic and monitoring therapeutic efficacy in different diseases.
