32575701|t|Cholinergic System and NGF Receptors: Insights from the Brain of the Short-Lived Fish Nothobranchius furzeri.
32575701|a|Nerve growth factor (NGF) receptors are evolutionary conserved molecules, and in mammals are considered necessary for ensuring the survival of cholinergic neurons. The age-dependent regulation of NTRK1/NTRKA and p75/NGFR in mammalian brain results in a reduced response of the cholinergic neurons to neurotrophic factors and is thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we study the age-dependent expression of NGF receptors (NTRK1/NTRKA and p75/NGFR) in the brain of the short-lived teleost fish Nothobranchius furzeri. We observed that NTRK1/NTRKA is more expressed than p75/NGFR in young and old animals, although both receptors do not show a significant age-dependent change. We then study the neuroanatomical organization of the cholinergic system, observing that cholinergic fibers project over the entire neuroaxis while cholinergic neurons appear restricted to few nuclei situated in the equivalent of mammalian subpallium, preoptic area and rostral reticular formation. Finally, our experiments do not confirm that NTRK1/NTRKA and p75/NGFR are expressed in cholinergic neuronal populations in the adult brain of N. furzeri. To our knowledge, this is the first study where NGF receptors have been analyzed in relation to the cholinergic system in a fish species along with their age-dependent modulation. We observed differences between mammals and fish, which make the African turquoise killifish an attractive model to further investigate the fish specific NGF receptors regulation.
