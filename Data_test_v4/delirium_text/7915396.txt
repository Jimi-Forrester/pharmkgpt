7915396|t|Neurosteroids and aggressive behaviour in Alzheimer's disease.
7915396|a|Aggressive behaviour is often the most troublesome aspect of Alzheimer's disease. The precise cause is unknown, and there is no fully effective and safe pharmacotherapy. I postulate that (in addition to other possible factors) there is an imbalance between those neurosteroids that facilitate cortical activity and those that restrain it, either through GABAergic neurons or other intermediates or directly on cortical glutamatergic neurons. It is suggested that this hypothesis may be tested experimentally. Positive results could lead to advances in treatment.
