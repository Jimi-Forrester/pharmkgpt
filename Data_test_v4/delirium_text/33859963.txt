33859963|t|The Effect of Microencapsulation of Phenolic Compounds from Lemon Waste by Persian and Basil Seed Gums on the Chemical and Microbiological Properties of Mayonnaise.
33859963|a|Natural preservatives with high level of phenolic compounds, antioxidants and antimicrobial activities are used in mayonnaise to improve quality and safety due to their potential health benefits. Application of these compounds in production processes highlights many difficulties due to instability of their physical and chemical properties. Microencapsulation is used to address these restrictions. In this study, phenolic compounds from lemon waste were encapsulated with Persian gum (PG) and basil seed gum (BSG) as coating materials at different ratios (0:1, 1:0, and 1:1) at 15% (w/w) total biopolymer. We confirmed microencapsulation by scanning electron microscopy, and evaluate phenolic content, antioxidant activity, encapsulation efficiency, morphology, water solubility indexes, and water absorption indexes. Sample mayonnaise was prepared using microencapsulated polyphenols from lemon waste and extract (1,000 ppm of concentration), and control samples without extracts or microcapsules. All samples were subjected to chemical (measuring the peroxide, thiobarbituric acid, acidity, and color) and microbial (total count of microorganisms and Escherichia coli) analysis during 30 days of storage. BSG samples exhibited the highest antioxidant activity (61.19%) and encapsulation efficiency (70.72%), and PG/BSG microcapsules had the highest capability to prevent oxidative deterioration during storage. Addition of microcapsules led to increases in parameter b* and decreases in parameters a* and L*. In general, PG/BSG microcapsules were considered optimal samples for production of mayonnaise, since they prevented mayonnaise deterioration and exhibited antioxidant and antimicrobial properties.
