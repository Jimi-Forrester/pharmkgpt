37345454|t|alpha-Synuclein and biological membranes: the danger of loving too much.
37345454|a|The aberrant aggregation of alpha-Synuclein (alphaS), a disordered protein primarily localised at the neuronal synapses, is associated with a number of neurodegenerative disorders including Parkinson's disease (PD). The biological properties of alphaS are strictly connected with its ability to bind synaptic membranes under both physiological and pathological conditions. Here we overview the recent studies on the structural and biological properties of the membrane interaction by alphaS. The characterisation of this state is particularly challenging as the membrane binding of alphaS is weak, transient and features a considerable degree of conformational disorder. Advancements in this area have been achieved through combinations of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), super-resolution microscopy, cryo-EM and cellular biophysics. Current data clarified the central role of the equilibrium between ordered and disordered states of alphaS at the membrane surface, which regulates the membrane affinity, the aggregation into amyloid fibrils and the promotion of vesicle clustering. Recent results on toxic oligomeric species of alphaS also revealed common features in the membrane interaction of functional and aberrant forms of this protein. These findings therefore evidence the challenging nature of identifying suitable therapeutics to target the aberrant aggregation of alphaS in PD while leaving its normal physiological form unperturbed.
