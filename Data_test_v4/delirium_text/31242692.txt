31242692|t|Molecular Mechanisms of Microglial Motility: Changes in Ageing and Alzheimer's Disease.
31242692|a|Microglia are the tissue-resident immune cells of the central nervous system, where they constitute the first line of defense against any pathogens or injury. Microglia are highly motile cells and in order to carry out their function, they constantly undergo changes in their morphology to adapt to their environment. The microglial motility and morphological versatility are the result of a complex molecular machinery, mainly composed of mechanisms of organization of the actin cytoskeleton, coupled with a "sensory" system of membrane receptors that allow the cells to perceive changes in their microenvironment and modulate their responses. Evidence points to microglia as accountable for some of the changes observed in the brain during ageing, and microglia have a role in the development of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease. The present review describes in detail the main mechanisms driving microglial motility in physiological conditions, namely, the cytoskeletal actin dynamics, with emphasis in proteins highly expressed in microglia, and the role of chemotactic membrane proteins, such as the fractalkine and purinergic receptors. The review further delves into the changes occurring to the involved proteins and pathways specifically during ageing and in Alzheimer's disease, analyzing how these changes might participate in the development of this disease.
