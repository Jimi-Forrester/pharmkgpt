35005192|a|INTRODUCTION: To assess the relationship between memory performance defined by the Stages of Objective Memory Impairment (SOMI) system and the Alzheimer's disease (AD) ATN (amyloid beta [A], pathologic tau [T], and neurodegeneration [N]) biomarker system. METHODS: We used data from the Harvard Aging Brain Study cohort to estimate the level of ATN biomarkers: amyloid beta (C-Pittsburgh compound B-positron emission tomography [PET]), tau (F-18-flortaucipir [FTP] PET), and neurodegeneration (magnetic resonance imaging volumetrics). We assessed the cross-sectional relationship of SOMI classification with global amyloid levels, entorhinal and inferior temporal tau deposition, and hippocampal atrophy. RESULTS: Participants with both memory storage and retrieval deficits (SOMI-3, -4) had smaller hippocampal volumes and higher entorhinal and inferior temporal tau burden than participants with no memory impairment (SOMI-0) or mild retrieval difficulty (SOMI-1). Amyloid burden did not differ among SOMI stages. DISCUSSION: This pilot supports the close relationship between tau pathology and memory impairment across the AD continuum.  SOMI may be useful to determine eligibility for randomized controlled trials prior to the assessment of biomarker status.
