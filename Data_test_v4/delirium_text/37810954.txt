37810954|t|Grip Strength is a Predictor for Subsyndromal Delirium Among Older Adults Following Joint Replacement.
37810954|a|Background: Delirium is common in older patients during the postoperative period, increasing the number of adverse events, and grip strength is associated with delirium. Subsyndromal delirium (SSD) is a prostate of clinical delirium; nevertheless, the relationship between grip strength and SSD has not been elucidated. This study aimed to examine the association between grip strength and SSD in the elderly after arthroplasty. Methods: A total of 181 patients were recruited from two Chinese hospitals. SSD and delirium were evaluated before the surgery and the first week after surgery using the confusion assessment method. The Mini-mental State Examination was used to assess patients' cognitive function, and their grip strength was evaluated with an electronic hand dynamometer before surgery. Logistic regression and ROC curve analysis were conducted to determine the odds ratio and predictive value of grip strength for SSD. Results: The incidence of SSD and postoperative delirium (POD) was 41.44% and 14.36% for the elderly following arthroplasty respectively, and approximately 1/3 of SSD progressed into POD. Older age, declined cognitive function, fall history, and lower grip strength were risk factors for SSD (P<0.05). The area under the ROC curve of grip strength was 0.863 and 0.900 for males and females respectively, and the cut-off point of it was determined to be 22.050 kg for men and 18.050 kg for women. Conclusion: SSD and POD are common among older people. Decreased grip strength, advanced age, lower cognitive function, and fall history were independent risk factors for SSD, and grip strength was a significant predictor for SSD in aged patients after the arthroplasty.
