MATERIAL AND METHOD: Sixty-seven patients with Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, and mixed dementia were recruited to our cross-sectional study. Neuropsychiatric batteries including the Mini Mental Status Examination-Thai 2002, Thai Geriatric Depression Scale, 23 items from Alzheimer's Disease co-operative Study activities of daily living inventory, Behavioralpathology in Alzheimer's disease rating scale, and Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index were tested. RESULTS: The most common behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) were sleep problems (100%), paranoid/delusion (59.7%), diurnal disturbance (49.2%) and aggressiveness (46.3%). Hallucination and affective problems were more severe in AD than in VaD/mixed dementia. Sleep problems were identified more severe in mild dementia than moderate-to-severe dementia. With longer duration of having dementia, exceptfor affective problem, there was no diffemence in behavioral and psychological symptoms observed compared to the shorter dementia group. CONCLUSION: Behavioral and psychological symptoms were very common in Alzheimer disease, vascular dementia, and mixed dementia. Since these symptoms cause cognitive and functional decline, institutionalization, caregiver distress and increase direct costs ofcare, the problem must be identified and addressed.
