31286043|a|BACKGROUND: Total hip arthroplasty (THA) is the preferred treatment for displaced femoral neck fractures in select patients, although dislocation remains a concern. In some studies, the supercapsular percutaneously assisted (SuperPATH) approach has demonstrated early mobilization, short hospital stay, and low dislocation rates in primary THA, but there are little data on its use for fractures. This study describes the perioperative outcomes and early dislocation rate of SuperPATH THA for displaced femoral neck fragility fractures. METHODS: A retrospective review was performed of previous ambulatory patients with a displaced femoral neck fragility fracture treated with THA using the SuperPATH approach. Demographic data, time to ambulation, length of stay, and in-hospital complications during the hospital stay and follow-up period were recorded. Phone interviews were conducted to check for dislocations 1 year after surgery. RESULTS: Thirty-seven consecutive patients were included with an average age of 75.0 years. Hospital stay averaged 5.5 days, and patients were discharged on average postoperative day 3.6. About 83.8% of patients were ambulatory by postoperative day 1, and 94.6% ambulatory before discharge. Twenty-seven percent of patients were discharged home, 46% to inpatient rehabilitation, 24% to skilled nursing facility, and 1 patient to hospice. At follow-up, there was no symptomatic heterotopic ossification and no infections. Thirty-two patients were available for telephone interviews at 1 year, with no dislocations reported. CONCLUSIONS: In this small cohort, the SuperPATH approach for THA appears to be safe and effective for use in femoral neck fragility fractures, resulting in early ambulation and a low dislocation rate.
