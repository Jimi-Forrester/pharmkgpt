3048225|t|The effects of acute scopolamine in geriatric depression.
3048225|a|In an intensive multidrug, multidose study, nine elderly depressed patients were administered 0.1, 0.25, and 0.5 mg of scopolamine hydrobromide, 1 mg of oral lorazepam, and placebo in a double-blind investigation aimed at assessing the status of the central cholinergic nervous system in geriatric depression. Significant cognitive and behavioral effects of scopolamine were observed only at the high dose (0.5 mg), while lower doses and lorazepam showed no significant differences from placebo. Cognitive deficits caused by scopolamine were in the areas of new learning, access to semantic memory, vigilance, and continuous performance. Behavioral effects consisted of activation, restlessness, and anxiety, but there was no significant effect on depressed mood. These results suggest that elderly depressed patients with mild to moderate cognitive impairment seem to be more similar to previously studied elderly controls rather than to patients with Alzheimer's disease in their reaction to short-term cholinergic blockade, and suggest that the cognitive and mood changes often seen in geriatric depression may involve factors other than disturbed muscarinic cholinergic mechanisms.
