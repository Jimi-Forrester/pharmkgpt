26463036|a|It has been suggested that the aggregation and cytotoxicity of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide with transition-metal ions in neuronal cells is involved in the development and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). As the most abundant protein in blood plasma and in cerebrospinal fluid, human serum albumin (HSA) can bind Abeta in vivo and subsequently inhibit Abeta fibril growth. However, the roles of albumin in Cu-induced Abeta aggregation and toxicity, and its potential biological relevance to AD therapy, were not stressed enough. Here, we showed that HSA was capable of binding Cu (I) with much higher affinity than Abeta, competitively inhibiting the interaction of Abeta and Cu ions. In the presence of biological reducing agent ascorbate, HSA inhibited Cu (II)/Cu (I)-mediated Abeta40 aggregation, reactive oxygen species production, and neurotoxicity. However, in the absence of Cu (II)/Cu (I), HSA could not effectively inhibit Abeta40 aggregation and neurotoxicity at 24 h (or less) incubation time, but decreased Abeta40 aggregation at much longer incubation (120 h). Our data suggested that through competitively decreasing Cu-Abeta interaction, HSA could effectively inhibit Cu (II)/Cu (I)-induced Abeta40 aggregation and neurotoxicity, and play important roles in regulating redox balance as well as metal homeostasis in AD prevention and therapy.
