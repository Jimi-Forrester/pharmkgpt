36770048|t|Corrosion Behavior of Aluminium-Coated Cans.
36770048|a|Hundreds of billions of aluminium-based cans are manufactured and used every year worldwide including those containing soft drinks. This study investigates and evaluates the performance and quality of two well-known energy and soft drinks brands, Green Cola and Red Bull. Recent health hazards and concerns have been associated with aluminium leakage and bisphenol A (BPA) dissociation from the can's internal protective coating. The cans were examined under four conditions, including coated and uncoated samples, the soft drink's main solution, and 0.1 M acetic acid solution. Electrochemical measurements such as potentiodynamic polarization and impedance spectroscopy (EIS), element analyses using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES), and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) were performed. In addition, sample characterization by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction spectroscopy (XRD) were employed to comprehensively study and analyze the effect of corrosion on the samples. Even though the internal coating provided superior corrosion protection concerning main or acetic acid solutions, it failed to prevent aluminium from dissolving in the electrolyte. Green Cola's primary solution appears to be extremely corrosive, as the corrosion rate increased by approximately 333% relative to the acetic acid solution. Uncoated samples resulted in increases in the percentage of oxygen, the appearance of more corrosion spots, and decreases in crystallinity. The ICP-OES test detected dangerous levels of aluminium in the Green Cola solution, which increased significantly after increasing the conductivity of the solution.
