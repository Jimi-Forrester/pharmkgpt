39483763|t|Cognitive Impairment in Multiple Sclerosis: An Update on Assessment and Management.
39483763|a|Cognitive impairment (CI) is a core feature of multiple sclerosis (MS) and affects up to 65% of patients in every phase of the disease, having a deep impact on all aspects of patients' lives. Cognitive functions most frequently involved include information processing speed, learning and memory, visuospatial abilities, and executive function. The precise pathogenetic mechanisms underpinning CI in MS are still largely unknown, but are deemed to be mainly related to pathological changes in lesioned and normal-appearing white matter, specific neuronal grey matter structures, and immunological alterations, with particular impact on synaptic transmission and plasticity. Moreover, much research is needed on therapeutic strategies. Small to moderate efficacy has been reported for disease-modifying therapies, particularly high-efficacy drugs, and symptomatic therapies (dalfampridine), while the strongest benefit emerged after cognitive training. The present narrative review provides a concise, updated overview of more recent evidence on the prevalence, profile, pathogenetic mechanisms, and treatment of CI in people with MS. CI should be screened on a regular basis as part of routine clinical assessments, and brief tools are now widely available (such as the Symbol Digit Modalities Test). The main goal of cognitive assessment in MS is the prompt implementation of preventive and treatment interventions.
