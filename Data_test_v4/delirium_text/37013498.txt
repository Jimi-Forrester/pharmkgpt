37013498|a|BACKGROUND: Black Americans have disproportionately higher rates and earlier onset of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) relative to White Americans. We currently lack a comprehensive understanding of how the lived experience and broader societal factors, including cumulative exposure to structural racism and the mechanisms underlying the risks, may contribute to elevated ADRD risk in Black Americans. METHODS: The Think PHRESH study builds on existing, community-based research infrastructure, from the ongoing Pittsburgh Hill/Homewood Research on Neighborhood Change and Health (PHRESH) studies, to examine the contributions of dynamic neighborhood socioeconomic conditions across the lifecourse to cognitive outcomes in mid- and late-life adults living in two historically disinvested, predominantly Black communities (anticipated n = 1133). This longitudinal, mixed-methods study rests on the premise that neighborhood racial segregation and subsequent disinvestment contributes to poor cognitive outcomes via factors including (a) low access to educational opportunities and (b) high exposure to race- and socioeconomically-relevant stressors, such as discrimination, trauma, and adverse childhood events. In turn, these cumulative exposures foster psychological vigilance in residents, leading to cardiometabolic dysregulation and sleep disruption, which may mediate associations between neighborhood disadvantage and ADRD risk. This premise recognizes the importance of potential protective factors that may promote cognitive health, including neighborhood social cohesion, safety, and satisfaction. The proposed study will leverage our existing longitudinal data on risk/protective factors and biobehavioral mediators and will include: (1) up to three waves of cognitive assessments in participants ages 50 years + and one assessment in participants ages 35-49 years; clinical adjudication of ADRD will be completed in participants who are 50+, (2) extensive surveys of risk and protective factors, (3) two assessments of blood pressure and objectively measured sleep, (4) a comprehensive assessment of life and residential history; and (5) two rounds of in-depth qualitative interviews to reveal lifecourse opportunities and barriers experienced by Black Americans in achieving optimal cognitive health in late life. DISCUSSION: Understanding how structural racism has influenced the lived experience of Black Americans, including dynamic changes in neighborhood conditions over time, is critical to inform multi-level intervention and policy efforts to reduce pervasive racial and socioeconomic disparities in ADRD.
