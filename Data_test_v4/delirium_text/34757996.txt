34757996|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Blood pressure management is a cornerstone of hemodynamic management in patients treated in the ICU after noncardiac surgery. Postoperative blood pressure management is challenging, because blood pressure alterations after surgery can be profound and have numerous causes. RECENT FINDINGS: Postoperative blood pressure alterations are common in patients treated in ICUs after noncardiac surgery. There is increasing evidence that hypotension during the initial days after noncardiac surgery is associated with postoperative adverse outcomes including myocardial infarction and death, acute myocardial injury, acute kidney injury, major adverse cardiac or cerebrovascular events, and delirium. Thus, postoperative hypotension could be a modifiable risk factor for postoperative adverse outcomes. However, robust evidence for a causal relationship between postoperative blood pressure and postoperative adverse outcomes is still lacking. SUMMARY: Future research on postoperative blood pressure management in patients treated in the ICU after noncardiac surgery needs to assess whether the prevention or treatment of postoperative blood pressure alterations - especially postoperative hypotension - reduces the incidence of postoperative adverse outcomes.
