33797364|t|Roles of Cannabidiol in the Treatment and Prevention of Alzheimer's Disease by Multi-target Actions.
33797364|a|Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases with chronic, progressive, and irreversible characteristics, affecting nearly 50 million older adults worldwide. The pathogenesis of AD includes the formation of senile plaques, the abnormal aggregation of tau protein and the gradual degeneration and death of cerebral cortical cells. The main symptoms are memory loss, cognitive decline and behavioral disorders. Studies indicate that cannabidiol (CBD) possesses various pharmacological activities, including anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidation and neuroprotective activities. It has been suggested as a potential multi-target medicine for the treatment of AD. In this review, we aim to summarize the underlying mechanisms and protective effects of CBD on signaling pathways and central receptors involved in the pathogenesis of AD, including the endocannabinoid system (eCBs), the Transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1(TRPV1) receptor, and the Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor (PPAR) receptor.
