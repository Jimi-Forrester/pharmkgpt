39335404|a|Objective: This meta-analysis with a systematic review was undertaken to assess the association between APOE allelic genotypes and the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in the Italian population. Methods: The Web of Science, PubMed, and Scopus databases were searched until 15 November 2023. The odds ratio (OR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated using fixed and random effect models, depending on the I2 statistic value. The systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted in agreement with the PRISMA guideline and registered with PROSPERO (CRD42023492580). Results: Our meta-analysis based on 15 studies revealed a higher risk of AD among Italian individuals carrying the APOE epsilon4 allele (OR = 3.60, 95% CI [2.90-4.47], p < 0.0001). The association of AD genotype APOE epsilon2epsilon4 (OR = 1.36, 95% CI [0.76-2.41], p = 0.29) was not statistically significant, while APOE epsilon3epsilon4 (OR = 3.43, 95% CI [2.95-3.99], p < 0.0001) has a high risk of AD development; the risk is more notably in the APOE epsilon4epsilon4 genotype (OR = 7.08, 95% CI [4.22-11.86], p < 0.0001). The APOE epsilon2 allele has a protective effect (APOE epsilon2 (OR = 0.47, 95% CI [0.29-0.74], p = 0.0013)), and similar results were achieved by APOE epsilon3 (OR  =  0.49, 95% CI [0.37-0.65], p < 0.0001). Subgroup analysis of three areas of Italy (southern, northern, and center) revealed that that APOE epsilon4 allele was a risk factor with a higher OR in northern Italy (OR 4.22; 95% CI [3.46-5.16], p < 0.0001) compared to southern and center Italy (OR 3.02; 95% CI [2.28-4.01], p < 0.0001 and OR 3.97; 95% CI [1.37-11.56], p < 0.0001, respectively). As well, APOE epsilon4epsilon4 genotype carriers had a significantly higher OR in northern Italy (OR 9.69; 95% CI [4.94-18.99], p < 0.0001) compared to in southern and center Italy (OR 4.38; 95% CI [1.54-12.47], p < 0.0001 and OR 3.59; 95% CI [0.87-14.86], p < 0.0001, respectively). Conclusions: This systematic review with a meta-analysis of the Italian population on APOE alleles, genotyping, and AD incidence, highlights that individuals harboring APOE epsilon4 have a higher risk of developing AD compared to those with other alleles. It also supports the protective effect of the APOE epsilon2 allele against the progress of AD. The qualitative analysis on the complex genetic interactions influencing Alzheimer risk emphasizes the need for further research on genetic and environmental factors for effective prevention strategies.
