35031955|t|Role of Inflammaging on the Reproductive Function and Pregnancy.
35031955|a|During female lifetime and pregnancy, inflammation and cellular senescence are implicated in physiological processes, from ovulation and menstruation, to placental homeostasis and delivery. Several lifestyles, nutritional, and environmental insults, as well as long-lasting pregestational inflammatory diseases may lead to detrimental effects in promoting and sustaining a chronic excessive inflammatory response and inflammaging, which finally contribute to the decay of fertility and pregnancy outcome, with a negative effect on placental function, fetal development, and future health risk profile in the offspring. Maladaptation to pregnancy and obstetric disease may in turn increase maternal inflammaging in a feedback loop, speeding up aging processes and outbreak of chronic diseases. Maternal inflammaging may also impact, through transgenerational effects, on future adult health. Hence, efficacious interventions should be implemented by physicians and healthcare professionals involved in prevention activities to reduce the modifiable factors contributing to the inflammaging process in order to improve public health.
