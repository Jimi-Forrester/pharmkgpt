However, it is unknown whether there is a difference in COVID-19 treatment outcomes between patients who are current cannabis users, excessive alcohol drinkers and those who use a known hazardous stimulant such as methamphetamine (METH). METHODS: Electronic medical records (EMR) of COVID-19 patients with current METH (n = 32), cannabis (n = 46), and heavy alcohol use (n = 44) were reviewed. COVID-19 infection was confirmed by positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test, current drug use was confirmed by positive urine drug testing, and alcohol use was identified by a blood alcohol concentration greater than 11 mg/dl. Multivariate linear regression models as well as the firth logistic regression models were used to examine the effect of substance use group (METH, cannabis, or alcohol) on treatment outcome measures. RESULTS: A total of 122 patients were included in this analysis. There were no significant differences found between drug groups in regards to key SARS-CoV-2 outcomes of interest including ICU admission, length of stay, interval between SARS-CoV-2 positive test and hospital discharge, delirium, intubation and mortality after adjusting for covariates. About one-fifth (21.9% in METH users, 15.2% in cannabis users, and 20.5% in alcohol users) of all patients required ICU admission. As many as 37.5% of METH users, 23.9% of cannabis users, and 29.5% of alcohol users developed delirium (P = 0.4). There were no significant differences between drug groups in COVID-19 specific medication requirements. Eight patients in total died within 10 months of positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test. Two patients from the METH group (6.3%), two patients from the cannabis group (4.3%), and four patients from the alcohol group (9.1%) died. DISCUSSION: The study outcomes may have been affected by several limitations. These included the methodology of its retrospective design, relatively small sample size, and the absence of a COVID-19 negative control group. In addition, there was no quantification of substance use and many covariates relied on clinical documentation or patient self-report. Finally, it was difficult to control for all potential confounders particularly given the small sample size. CONCLUSION: Despite these limitations, our results show that current METH, cannabis, and heavy alcohol users in this study have similar treatment outcomes and suffer from high morbidity including in-hospital delirium and high mortality rates within the first-year post COVID-19. The extent to which co-morbid tobacco smoking contributed to the negative outcomes in METH, cannabis, and alcohol users remains to be investigated.
