29079010|a|OBJECTIVE: To study the association between the potential inappropriate prescriptions (PIP) and the 30 and 180-day adverse event rate after discharge from a Short Stay Unit (SSU). METHODOLOGY: A retrospective cohort observational study was conducted on patients aged >=75years discharged from an SSU from February to April, 2014. STOPP-START criteria version2 was used. The main outcome was 30 and 180-day adverse event rate after being discharged. RESULTS: A total of 179 patients, with a mean age of 84 (SD5) years were included. The presence of >=1PIP after being discharged was not associated with a 30 and 180-day composite adverse event. Patients with >=1PIP related to a cerebro-cardiovascular process were at higher risk of an adverse event at 30 days after discharge (adjusted OR, 2.1; 95%CI: 1.0-3.2; P=.045), those with >=1PIP related to neuropsychiatric process and risk of fall were at higher risk of increased 30-day functional impairment (adjusted OR, 6.3; 95%CI: 1.7-22.5; P=.005), and those with >=1PIP related to omission of cardiovascular system were at higher risk of 180-day hospital readmission (adjusted OR, 3.6; 95%CI: 1.5-8.3; P=.003). CONCLUSIONS: The presence of adverse events in older patients discharged from SSU may be associated with PIP, identified by STOPP-START criteria, and more specifically with drugs related to cardiovascular, neuropsychiatric disorders, and falls.
