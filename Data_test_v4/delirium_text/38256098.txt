38256098|a|Periodontitis is a chronic infectious disorder damaging periodontal tissues, including the gingiva, periodontal ligament, cementum, and alveolar bone. It arises from the complex interplay between pathogenic oral bacteria and host immune response. Contrary to the previous view of "energy factories", mitochondria have recently been recognized as semi-autonomous organelles that fine-tune cell survival, death, metabolism, and other functions. Under physiological conditions, periodontal tissue cells participate in dynamic processes, including differentiation, mineralization, and regeneration. These fundamental activities depend on properly functioning mitochondria, which play a crucial role through bioenergetics, dynamics, mitophagy, and quality control. However, during the initiation and progression of periodontitis, mitochondrial quality control is compromised due to a range of challenges, such as bacterial-host interactions, inflammation, and oxidative stress. Currently, mounting evidence suggests that mitochondria dysfunction serves as a common pathological mechanism linking periodontitis with systemic conditions like type II diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, targeting mitochondria to intervene in periodontitis and multiple associated systemic diseases holds great therapeutic potential. This review provides advanced insights into the interplay between mitochondria, periodontitis, and associated systemic diseases. Moreover, we emphasize the significance of diverse therapeutic modulators and signaling pathways that regulate mitochondrial function in periodontal and systemic cells.
