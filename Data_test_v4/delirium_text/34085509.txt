34085509|t|Identification of hypercoagulability with thrombelastography in patients with hip fracture receiving thromboprophylaxis.
34085509|a|Background: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is the second most common complication after hip fracture surgery. We used thrombelastography (TEG), a whole-blood, point-of-care test that can provide an overview of the clotting process, to determine the duration of hypercoagulability after hip fracture surgery. Methods: In this prospective study, consecutive patients aged 51 years or more with hip fractures (trochanteric region or neck) amenable to surgical treatment who presented to the emergency department were eligible for enrolment. Thrombelastography, including calculation of the coagulation index (CI) (combination of 4 TEG parameters for an overall assessment of coagulation) was performed daily from admission until 5 days postoperatively, and at 2 and 6 weeks postoperatively. All patients received 28 days of thromboprophylaxis. We used single-sample t tests to compare mean maximal amplitude (MA) values (a measure of clot strength) to the hypercoagulable threshold of greater than 65 mm, a predictor of in-hospital VTE. Results: Of the 35 patients enrolled, 11 (31%) were hypercoagulable on admission based on an MA value greater than 65 mm, and 29 (83%) were hypercoagulable based on a CI value greater than 3.0; the corresponding values at 6 weeks were 23 (66%) and 34 (97%). All patients had an MA value greater than 65 mm at 2 weeks. Patients demonstrated normal coagulation on admission (mean MA value 62.2 mm [standard deviation (SD) 6.3 mm], p = 0.01) but became significantly hypercoagulable at 2 weeks (mean 71.6 mm [SD 2.6 mm], p < 0.001). There was a trend toward persistent hypercoagulability at 6 weeks (mean MA value 66.2 mm [SD 3.8 mm], p = 0.06). Conclusion: More than 50% of patients remained hypercoagulable 6 weeks after fracture despite thromboprophylaxis. Thrombelastography MA thresholds or a change in MA over time may help predict VTE risk; however, further study is needed.
