37408225|t|Oxidative Stress and Inflammation Biomarkers in Postoperative Pain Modulation in Surgically Treated Patients with Laryngeal Cancer-Pilot Study.
37408225|a|(1) Background: Surgical treatment of laryngeal carcinoma includes different types of laryngectomies with neck dissection. Surgical tissue damage triggers an inflammatory response, leading to the release of pro-inflammatory molecules. This increases reactive oxygen species production and decreases antioxidant defense mechanisms, leading to postoperative oxidative stress. The aim of this study was to assess the correlation between oxidative stress (malondialdehyde, MDA; glutathione peroxidase, GPX; superoxide dismutase, SOD) and inflammation (interleukin 1, IL-1; interleukin-6, IL-6; C-reactive protein, CRP) parameters and postoperative pain management in patients surgically treated with laryngeal cancer. (2) Methods: This prospective study included 28 patients with surgically treated laryngeal cancer. Blood samples were taken for the analysis of oxidative stress and inflammation parameters before the operative treatment and after the operative treatment (1st postoperative day and 7th postoperative day). The concentrations of MDA, SOD, GPX, IL-1, IL-6, and CRP in the serum were determined by coated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The visual analog scale (VAS) was used for pain assessment. (3) Results and conclusion: There was a correlation between oxidative stress and inflammation biomarkers and postoperative pain modulation in surgically treated patients with laryngeal cancer. Age, more extensive surgery, CRP values, and use of tramadol were predictors for oxidative stress parameters.
