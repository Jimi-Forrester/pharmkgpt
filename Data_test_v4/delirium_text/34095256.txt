34095256|t|Hotspot and Frontier Analysis of Exercise Training Therapy for Heart Failure Complicated With Depression Based on Web of Science Database and Big Data Analysis.
34095256|a|Background: Exercise training has been extensively studied in heart failure (HF) and psychological disorders, which has been shown to worsen each other. However, our understanding of how exercise simultaneously protect heart and brain of HF patients is still in its infancy. The purpose of this study was to take advantage of big data techniques to explore hotspots and frontiers of mechanisms that protect the heart and brain simultaneously through exercise training. Methods: We studied the scientific publications on related research between January 1, 2003 to December 31, 2020 from the WoS Core Collection. Research hotspots were assessed through open-source software, CiteSpace, Pajek, and VOSviewer. Big data analysis and visualization were carried out using R, Cytoscape and Origin. Results: From 2003 to 2020, the study on HF, depression, and exercise simultaneously was the lowest of all research sequences (two-way ANOVAs, p < 0.0001). Its linear regression coefficient r was 0.7641. The result of hotspot analysis of related keyword-driven research showed that inflammation and stress (including oxidative stress) were the common mechanisms. Through the further analyses, we noted that inflammation, stress, oxidative stress, apoptosis, reactive oxygen species, cell death, and the mechanisms related to mitochondrial biogenesis/homeostasis, could be regarded as the primary mechanism targets to study the simultaneous intervention of exercise on the heart and brain of HF patients with depression. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate the potential mechanism targets by which exercise interferes with both the heart and brain for HF patients with depression. We hope that they can boost the attention of other researchers and clinicians, and open up new avenues for designing more novel potential drugs to block heart-brain axis vicious circle.
