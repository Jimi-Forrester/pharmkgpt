17083302|t|The effect of sleep-disordered breathing on stages of sleep in patients with Alzheimer's disease.
17083302|a|Patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) commonly have poor sleep and a high reported incidence of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). This study examined how the presence of SDB affected sleep stages in AD patients. Sixty-six volunteers with mild - moderate AD underwent home polysomnography. Results showed that patients with SDB spent less of the night in REM sleep than those with no SDB, but there were no differences in other sleep stages. The findings suggest that the decreased amount of REM sleep may be due to the presence of AD and SDB. Treating these patients' SDB may increase their amount of REM sleep, which may result in improved daytime functioning. Controlled trials of SDB treatment in AD are needed to answer this question.
