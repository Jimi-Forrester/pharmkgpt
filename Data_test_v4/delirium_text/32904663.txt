32904663|a|We administered a web-based survey to a convenience sample of 561 patients in a large health system to assess patient attitudes toward dementia prevention in the context of designing a multi-domain Alzheimer's risk reduction intervention. The majority of respondents reported being very concerned about Alzheimer's disease, wanted to know their personal risk factors, and were highly motivated to make healthy lifestyle changes to lower dementia risk. The areas they were most interested in targeting to reduce dementia risk included physical activity, cognitive stimulation, nutrition, and sleep. These results provided strong support for our conceptual framework to target higher-risk patients with a personalized risk reduction strategy.
