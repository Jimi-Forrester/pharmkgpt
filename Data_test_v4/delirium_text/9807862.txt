9807862|t|[Psychiatric pathology after extracorporeal cardiac surgery: a case report of tardive postoperative cognitive dysfunction].
9807862|a|CLINICAL OBSERVATION: A 67-year-old female patient operated of a severe aortic esthenosis with extracorporeal circulation during cardiac surgery, developed psychiatric disturbances with excitement and delirium, being necessary internamtient in a psychiatric ward, a month later. The evolution was right after neuroleptic treatment and nowdays she's assimptomatic. We review what is wrote about posteparative cognitive dysfunction (POCD), being this a tardive presentation case. We analize the definition, prevalence, etiology, pathofisiology, treatment and prevention since it is a reversible surgery complication but if it isn't early diagnosed and treated, its morbidity and mortality can be high.
