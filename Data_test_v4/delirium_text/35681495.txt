35681495|t|AMPK Modulates the Metabolic Adaptation of C6 Glioma Cells in Glucose-Deprived Conditions without Affecting Glutamate Transport.
35681495|a|Energy homeostasis in the central nervous system largely depends on astrocytes, which provide metabolic support and protection to neurons. Astrocytes also ensure the clearance of extracellular glutamate through high-affinity transporters, which indirectly consume ATP. Considering the role of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in the control of cell metabolism, we have examined its implication in the adaptation of astrocyte functions in response to a metabolic stress triggered by glucose deprivation. We genetically modified the astrocyte-like C6 cell line to silence AMPK activity by overexpressing a dominant negative mutant of its catalytic subunit. Upon glucose deprivation, we found that C6 cells maintain stable ATP levels and glutamate uptake capacity, highlighting their resilience during metabolic stress. In the same conditions, cells with silenced AMPK activity showed a reduction in motility, metabolic activity, and ATP levels, indicating that their adaptation to stress is compromised. The rate of ATP production remained, however, unchanged by AMPK silencing, suggesting that AMPK mostly influences energy consumption during stress conditions in these cells. Neither AMPK modulation nor prolonged glucose deprivation impaired glutamate uptake. Together, these results indicate that AMPK contributes to the adaptation of astrocyte metabolism triggered by metabolic stress, but not to the regulation of glutamate transport.
