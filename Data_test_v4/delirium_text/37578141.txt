37578141|a|Autosomal Dominant Alzheimer's disease (ADAD) is a rare early onset form of Alzheimer's disease disease, caused by dominant mutations in one of three genes: presenilin 1, presenilin 2 and amyloid beta precursor protein. Mutations in the presenilin 1 gene (PSEN1) account for the majority of cases, and individuals who inherit a single mutant PSEN1 allele go on to develop early onset dementia, ultimately leading to death. The presenilin 1 protein (PS1) is the catalytic subunit of the gamma-secretase protease, a tetrameric protease responsible for cleavage of numerous transmembrane proteins, including Notch and the amyloid beta precursor protein (APP). Inclusion of a mutant PS1 subunit in the gamma-secretase complex leads to a partial loss of enzyme function and an enrichment of longer, pathogenic forms of Abeta peptides over shorter forms, an established biomarker of ADAD progression in human patients. In this study we describe the development of a gene therapy vector expressing a wildtype (WT) copy of the human PSEN1 gene to ameliorate the loss of function associated with PSEN1 mutations. We have carried out studies in mouse models using a recombinant AAV9 vector to deliver the PSEN1 gene directly into the CNS and shown that we can normalize gamma-secretase function and slow neurodegeneration in both PSEN1 conditional knockout and PSEN1 mutant knock-in models. We have also carried out biodistribution studies in nonhuman primates and demonstrated the ability to achieve broad PS1 protein expression throughout the cortex and the hippocampus, two regions known to be critically involved in ADAD progression. These studies demonstrate preclinical proof of concept that expression of a WT human PSEN1 gene in cells harboring a dominant PSEN1 mutation can correct the gamma-secretase dysfunction. In addition, direct administration of the recombinant AAV9 into the NHP brain can achieve broad expression at levels predicted to provide efficacy in the clinic.
