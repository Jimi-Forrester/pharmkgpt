38353680|a|BACKGROUND: Transcatheter edge-to-edge mitral valve repair (M-TEER) is often performed in general anesthesia, and postprocedural monitoring is usually warranted on an intensive or intermediate care unit (ICU/IMC). We evaluated the implications of a dedicated valve unit (VU) instead of an ICU/IMC for monitoring after M-TEER. METHODS AND RESULTS: In total, 624 patients were retrospectively analyzed. A total of 312 patients were primarily transferred to either ICU or IMC following M-TEER, and 312 patients were scheduled for the VU in the absence of indications for ICU/IMC treatment. Hospital stay was significantly shorter in VU patients (median 6.0 days (interquartile range (IQR) 5.0 - 8.0) vs. 7.0 days (IQR 6.0 - 10.0), p < 0.001) and their risk for infections (2.9 vs. 7.7%, p = 0.008) and delirium (0.6 vs. 2.6%, p = 0.056) was substantially lower compared to ICU/IMC patients. In-hospital mortality was similar in both groups (0.6% vs. 1.3%, p = 0.41). Fifty patients (16.0%) in the VU group had to cross over to unplanned ICU/IMC admission. The most frequent indication was prolonged need for catecholamines (52.0%). Patients with ICU/IMC crossover had more advanced stages of heart failure (LV-EF < 30% in 36.0 vs. 16.0%, p = 0.001; severe concomitant tricuspid regurgitation in 48.0 vs. 27.8%, p = 0.005) and an LV-EF < 30% was independently associated with unplanned ICU/IMC admission. CONCLUSIONS: Following M-TEER postprocedural monitoring on a VU instead of an ICU/IMC is safe, reduces complications, and spares ICU capacities. Patients with advanced heart failure have a higher risk for unplanned ICU/IMC treatment after M-TEER.
