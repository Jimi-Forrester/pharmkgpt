38858647|t|The relationship between comprehensive geriatric assessment on the pneumonia prognosis of older adults: a cross-sectional study.
38858647|a|BACKGROUND: The mortality of pneumonia in older adults surpasses that of other populations, especially with the prevalence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Under the influence of multiple factors, a series of geriatric syndromes brought on by age is one of the main reasons for the poor prognosis of pneumonia. This study attempts to analyze the impact of geriatric syndrome on the prognosis of pneumonia. METHODS: This is a prospective cross-sectional study. Patients over 65 years old with COVID-19 and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-negative community-acquired pneumonia (SN-CAP) were included in the research. General characteristics, laboratory tests, length of stay (LOS), and comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) were collected. Multivariate regression analysis to determine the independent predictors of the severity, mortality, and LOS of COVID-19. At the same time, the enrolled subjects were divided into three categories by clustering analysis of 10 CGA indicators, and their clinical characteristics and prognoses were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 792 subjects were included in the study, including 204 subjects of SN-CAP (25.8%) and 588 subjects (74.2%) of COVID-19. There was no significant difference between non-severe COVID-19 and SN-CAP regarding mortality, LOS, and CGA (P > 0.05), while severe COVID-19 is significantly higher than both (P < 0.05). The Barthel Index used to assess the activities of daily living was an independent risk factor for the severity and mortality of COVID-19 and linearly correlated with the LOS (P < 0.05). The cluster analysis based on the CGA indicators divided the geriatric pneumonia patients into three groups: Cluster 1 (n = 276), named low ability group, with the worst CGA, laboratory tests, severity, mortality, and LOS; Cluster 3 (n = 228), called high ability group with the best above indicators; Cluster 2 (n = 288), named medium ability group, falls between the two. CONCLUSION: The Barthel Index indicates that decreased activities of daily living are an independent risk factor for the severity, mortality, and LOS of geriatric COVID-19. Geriatric syndrome can help judge the prognosis of pneumonia in older adults.
