34966760|a|Purpose: Dexmedetomidine has been shown to improve clinical outcomes in critically ill patients. However, its effect on septic patients remains controversial. Therefore, the purpose of this meta-analysis was to assess the effect of dexmedetomidine as a sedative agent for mechanically ventilated patients with sepsis. Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane Library from inception through May 2021 for randomized controlled trials that enrolled mechanically ventilated, adult septic patients comparing dexmedetomidine with other sedatives or placebo. Results: A total of nine studies involving 1,134 patients were included in our meta-analysis. The overall mortality (RR 0.97, 95%CI 0.82 to 1.13, P = 0.67, I2 = 25%), length of intensive care unit stay (MD -1.12, 95%CI -2.89 to 0.64, P = 0.21, I2 = 71%), incidence of delirium (RR 0.95, 95%CI 0.72 to 1.25, P = 0.70, I2 = 0%), and delirium free days (MD 1.76, 95%CI -0.94 to 4.47, P = 0.20, I2 = 80%) were not significantly different between dexmedetomidine and other sedative agents. Alternatively, the use of dexmedetomidine was associated with a significant reduction in the duration of mechanical ventilation (MD -0.53, 95%CI -0.85 to -0.21, P = 0.001, I2 = 0%) and inflammatory response (TNF-alpha: MD -5.27, 95%CI -7.99 to -2.54, P<0.001, I2 = 0%; IL-1beta: MD -1.25, 95%CI -1.91 to -0.59, P<0.001, I2 = 0%). Conclusions: For patients with sepsis, the use of dexmedetomidine as compared with other sedative agents does not affect all-cause mortality, length of intensive care unit stay, the incidence of delirium, and delirium-free days. But the dexmedetomidine was associated with the reduced duration of mechanical ventilation and inflammatory response.
