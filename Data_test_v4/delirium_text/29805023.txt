29805023|a|The beta amyloid (Abeta) induced neurodegeneration is believed to be one of pathological mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The inhibition of Abeta production or aggregation is one of the promising therapeutic strategies for anti-AD drug discovery. Here, a homogeneous neutral polysaccharide designated LBP1A1-1 with an average molecular weight of 45.0 kDa was purified from fruits of Lycium barbarum L. Its structure was characterized to possess a backbone of 1, 3-linked beta-Galp, 1, 6-linked beta-Galp, 1, 4-linked alpha-Glcp with branches substituted at C-3 position of 1, 6-linked beta-Galp or C-6 position of 1, 3-linked beta-Galp. The branches contained terminal (T)-linked beta-Galp, T-linked alpha-Araf, T-linked beta-Araf, 1, 5-linked alpha-Araf and T-linked beta-Rhap. The in vitro experiments revealed that LBP1A1-1 could inhibit Abeta42 production and impede Abeta42 aggregation in a dose-dependent-manner without cytotoxicity. These results suggested that LBP1A1-1 might have the multiple potential for the treatment of AD.
