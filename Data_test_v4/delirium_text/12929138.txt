12929138|a|Nicotine/nicotine agonists, which have been proposed as therapeutic agents for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders, produce a wide variety of effects on the nervous system. Some mechanisms involved remain poorly understood. In this work, immunohistochemical techniques were used to determine the effect of nicotine on nerve growth factor (NGF) in the frontoparietal (motor, somatosensory) brain cortex of the albino rat. Nicotine was chronically administered intraperitoneally using osmotic pumps (0.35 mg nicotine base/kg body weight/day for 14 days). An increase in the number and the immunoreaction intensity of NGF-like positive pyramidal and nonpyramidal neurons of these cortical areas was observed after treatment. Immunopositive astroglial cells were always seen in sections of treated animals but not in controls. The neuropil of control animals was, in general, devoid of reaction, but in treated animals, immunopositive prolongations were located randomly, some in close association with capillaries. At the electron microscopic level, these prolongations were demonstrated as belonging to neurons (dendrites and axons) and astroglial cells. Nicotinic activation of selected neurons and glial cells seems to trigger NGF/neurotrophic mechanisms, suggesting their use may be of benefit in prevention and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.
