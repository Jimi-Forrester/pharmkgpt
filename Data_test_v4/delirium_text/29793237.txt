29793237|t|Personalized neurology.
29793237|a|Personalized medicine simply means the prescription of specific therapeutics best suited for an individual based on pharmacogenetic and pharmacogenomic information. It involves integration of molecular diagnostics with therapeutics. Selection of a suitable medicine from various approaches available based on optimal efficacy and safety in an individual patient will be preferable to trial-and-error approaches. A personalized approach will improve the management of neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, neuropathic pain, and migraine. Gene therapy and RNA interference will facilitate the development of personalized treatment for neurological disorders. It is anticipated that several components of this system will be in place by the year 2010 and it will be a part of neurological practice by the year 2015. However, not all neurological disorders would require a personalized approach.
