37087693|a|BACKGROUND: The Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network (DIAN) is a longitudinal observational study that collects data on cognition, blood pressure (BP), and other variables from autosomal-dominant Alzheimer's disease mutation carriers (MCs) and non-carrier (NC) family members in early to mid-adulthood, providing a unique opportunity to evaluate BP and cognition relationships in these populations. METHOD: We examined cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships between systolic and diastolic BP and cognition in DIAN MC and NC. RESULTS: Data were available from 528 participants, who had a mean age of 38 (SD = 11) and were 42% male and 61% MCs, at a median follow-up of 2 years. Linear-multilevel models found only cross-sectional associations in the MC group between higher systolic BP and poorer performance on language (beta = -0.181 [-0.318, -0.044]), episodic memory (-0.212 [-0.375, -0.049]), and a composite cognitive measure (-0.146 [-0.276, -0.015]). In NCs, the relationship was cross-sectional only and present for language alone. DISCUSSION: Higher systolic BP was cross-sectionally but not longitudinally associated with poorer cognition, particularly in MCs. BP may influence cognition gradually, but further longitudinal research is needed.
