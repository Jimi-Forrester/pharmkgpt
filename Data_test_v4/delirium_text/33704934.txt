33704934|t|Study on the neuroprotective effects of Genistein on Alzheimer's disease.
33704934|a|Along with the aging of the world population, the incidence rate of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been increasing. At present, AD has become one of the most serious problems faced by modern medicine. Studies have shown that estrogen has a positive effect on AD, but estrogen has the side effect of leading to tumors. Recent in vivo studies have shown that genistein, one of the selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), can improve brain function through the blood-brain barrier (BBB), antagonize the toxicity of amyloid beta-protein (Abeta), that is, to inhibit neurotoxicity due to aggregation of beta amyloid protein, and have neuroprotective effects. In addition, the use of Gen can avoid the risk of endometrial cancer and breast cancer caused by estrogen therapy while exerting an estrogen-like effect, which has some potential for the delay and treatment of AD.
