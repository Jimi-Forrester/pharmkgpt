36370334|a|BACKGROUND: Studies have established the association between blood beta-amyloid (Abeta) levels and Alzheimer's disease, but population-based studies concerning the association between selenium (Se) and Abeta levels in blood samples are very limited. Therefore, we explored the association in an elderly population with Se status and serum Abeta measures. METHODS: A cross-sectional study on 469 elderly individuals from four rural counties with diverse soil Se levels was carried out. Fasting blood Se, serum selenoprotein P (SELENOP), and glutathione peroxidase (GPX), serum Abeta42, and Abeta40 were measured. Quantile regression models were used to determine the associations of blood Se, serum GPX, and SELENOP with Abeta levels. RESULTS: Significant negative associations were observed between blood Se and serum Abeta42 and Abeta40 levels at all percentiles (P < 0.05). The associations were generally stronger at higher Abeta42 and Abeta40 percentiles than lower Abeta42 and Abeta40 percentiles. Blood Se was positively associated with serum Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio at 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles. Significant positive associations were observed between serum GPX and Abeta42 and Abeta40 levels at all percentiles (P < 0.05). The positive associations were generally stronger at higher Abeta42 and Abeta40 percentiles than at lower percentiles. Serum GPX was negatively associated with Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio at 25th, 50th, 75th, and 95th percentiles. No associations with serum SELENOP and Abeta levels were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that higher Se levels are associated with lower serum Abeta42 and Abeta40 levels and with higher Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio, and the results are specific for different selenoproteins.
