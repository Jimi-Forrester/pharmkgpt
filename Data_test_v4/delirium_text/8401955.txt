8401955|t|Psychiatric aspects of heart transplantation.
8401955|a|There are many practical psychiatric, social, and ethical problems which accompany heart transplantation. These include pre- and postoperative anxiety and depressive conditions, post-operative delirium, and social and family dysfunctional syndromes. This paper reviews the literature critically in the following five areas: pre-transplant evaluation, coping with surgery, postoperative sequelae, rehabilitation, and management. Although most recipients have a good outcome from the physical and psychiatric points of view, a substantial minority experience family conflicts and sexual dysfunction after surgery. An average of 45% of patients from all studies returned to full-time employment. The distinctive role and contribution of the psychiatrist on the transplant team is discussed and important areas for future research are outlined.
