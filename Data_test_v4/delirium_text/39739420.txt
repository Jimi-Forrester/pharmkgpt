39739420|a|BACKGROUND: In Taiwan, as the population ages, palliative care services (PCS) have expanded significantly to include comprehensive benefit plans for critically ill individuals, supported by reimbursements from the National Health Insurance (NHI) program. However, incorporating palliative care into the medical management of these patients presents several challenges. We aim to evaluate the effects of palliative care interventions on medical resources in end-of-life scenarios to promote earlier palliative care access and provide high-quality healthcare services for patients. METHODS: A total of 2,202 patients were included in this study. Primary diagnosis and referral for PCS were assessed using ICD-10 and HNI code. All study subjects were divided into three groups: patients who did not receive PCS (no-PCS), patients who received PCS before their final hospital admission (PCS-before), and patients who received PCS after their final admission (PCS-after). We evaluated 1) the effects of PCS on eight medical resource utilization outcomes within the 30 days preceding death and 2) the effects of early intervention on two major diseases. RESULTS: Initiating PCS before a patient's last hospital admission was associated with less aggressive medical interventions in the 30 days before death, including reduced length of intensive care unit (ICU) (odds ratio [OR] = 0.25), and rates of endotracheal intubation (OR = 0.12), respiratory ventilator support (OR = 0.20), cardiopulmonary resuscitation (OR = 0.18), and blood transfusion (OR = 0.65). Among patients with cancer and lung diseases, those who received PCS prior to their final hospitalization of over 14 days experienced reduced hospitalization duration (OR = 0.52 and 0.24, respectively). Patients with lung disease also had significantly lower odds of ICU stays (OR = 0.44) and respiratory ventilation (OR = 0.33). CONCLUSION: The timing of palliative care intervention critically impact on duration of hospitalization and ICU stay and the need for intubation procedures or CPR. The findings can help the government and medical providers in developing comprehensive palliative care policies and programs to improve care quality and patient rights.
