24841287|t|Incidence and risk factors of delirium in the elderly general surgical patient.
24841287|a|BACKGROUND: This study evaluates the incidence of delirium and risk factors associated with delirium in elderly patients admitted to a general surgical ward. METHODS: Patients aged over 60 years who were admitted with an acute or elective general surgical diagnosis were eligible for this prospective cohort study. Risk factors associated with delirium were analyzed using univariate and multivariate analysis to identify those independently associated with delirium. RESULTS: A total of 209 patients were included in the study. The incidence of delirium was 16.9% (23.2% for acute admission, P < .001). Variables associated with delirium were dementia, presence of an urinary catheter, cognitive decline at admission measured with the mini-mental state examination, white blood cell count >10.0 x 10(9)/L, and urea >7.5 mmol/L. Median length of hospital stay was 13 days (range 3-85) for patients with delirium versus 7 (range 1-54) for patients without (P = .002). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of delirium is high in elderly patients, especially after an acute admission, leading to an increase in length of hospital stay. To minimize delirium, associated risk factors must be identified and, if possible, treated.
