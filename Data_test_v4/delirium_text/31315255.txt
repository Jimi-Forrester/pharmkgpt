31315255|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that damages health and welfare of the elderly, and there has been no effective therapy for AD until now. It has been proved that tanshinone IIA (tan IIA) could alleviate pathological symptoms of AD via improving non-amyloidogenic cleavage of amyloid precursor protein, decreasing the accumulations of p-tau and amyloid-beta1-42 (Abeta1-42), and so forth. However, the further biochemical mechanisms of tan IIA are not clear. The experiment was undertaken to explore metabolites of tan IIA in AD rats induced by microinjecting Abeta1-42 in the CA1 region of hippocampus. AD rats were orally administrated with tan IIA at 100 mg/kg weight, and plasma, urine, faeces, kidney, liver and brain were then collected for metabolites analysis by UHPLC-Q-Exactive Qrbitrap mass spectrometry. Consequently, a total of 37 metabolites were positively or putatively identified on the basis of mass fragmentation behavior, accurate mass measurements and retention times. As a result, methylation, hydroxylation, dehydration, decarbonylation, reduction reaction, glucuronidation, glycine linking and their composite reactions were characterized to illuminate metabolic pathways of tan IIA in vivo. Several metabolites presented differences in the distribution of tan IIA between the sham control and the AD model group. Overall, these results provided valuable references for research on metabolites of tan IIA in vivo and its probable active structure for exerting neuroprotection.
