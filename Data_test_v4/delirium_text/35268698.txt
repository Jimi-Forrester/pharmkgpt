35268698|t|"Green Is the Color": An Update on Ecofriendly Aspects of Organoselenium Chemistry.
35268698|a|Organoselenium compounds have been successfully applied in biological, medicinal and material sciences, as well as a powerful tool for modern organic synthesis, attracting the attention of the scientific community. This great success is mainly due to the breaking of paradigm demonstrated by innumerous works, that the selenium compounds were toxic and would have a potential impact on the environment. In this update review, we highlight the relevance of these compounds in several fields of research as well as the possibility to synthesize them through more environmentally sustainable methodologies, involving catalytic processes, flow chemistry, electrosynthesis, as well as by the use of alternative energy sources, including mechanochemical, photochemistry, sonochemical and microwave irradiation.
