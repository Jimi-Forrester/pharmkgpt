37685715|a|Early identification of Apolipoprotein E (APOE)-related microvascular pathology will help to study the microangiopathic contribution to Alzheimer's disease and provide a therapeutic target for early intervention. To evaluate the differences in retinal microvasculature parameters between APOE epsilon4 carriers and non-carriers, asymptomatic older adults aged >= 55 years underwent APOE epsilon4 genotype analysis, neuropsychological examination, and optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) imaging. One hundred sixty-three older adults were included in the data analysis. Participants were also defined as cognitively impaired (CI) and non-cognitively impaired (NCI) according to their MoCA scores and educational years. APOE epsilon4 carriers demonstrated reduced SVC (p = 0.023) compared to APOE epsilon4 non-carriers. Compared to NCI, CI participants showed reduced SVC density (p = 0.006). In the NCI group, no significant differences (p > 0.05) were observed in the microvascular densities between APOE epsilon4 carriers and non-carriers. In the CI group, APOE epsilon4 carriers displayed reduced microvascular densities compared to non-carriers (SVC, p = 0.006; DVC, p = 0.048). We showed that CI and APOE epsilon4 affect retinal microvasculature in older adults. Quantitative measures of the retinal microvasculature could serve as surrogates for brain microcirculation, providing an opportunity to study microvascular contributions to AD.
