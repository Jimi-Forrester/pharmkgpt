37006446|a|The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2 virus), has significantly impacted global health. It can present a range of complications, from asymptomatic to severe respiratory distress syndrome. It has also been linked to complications in multiple organ systems, including neurological symptoms such as headaches and encephalopathy. Delirium, characterized by acute confusion, is common in older adults and associated with prolonged hospital stays and elevated mortality rates. We present a case study of a young mother with a prior medical history of mild to moderate depression who experienced an episode of delirium consequent to a COVID-19 infection. The initial manifestation of her illness was mild diarrhea, but as her condition worsened, she began exhibiting symptoms of delirium. These symptoms include confusion, agitation, sleep disturbance, and disordered behavior. The delirious episode was brief and effectively managed with small doses of psychotropic medications to control aggressive behavior. Upon resolution, no additional treatment was deemed necessary. This case underscores the wide-ranging effects of COVID-19 on physical and psychological well-being and highlights the importance of considering symptoms beyond those associated with respiratory distress.
