38534726|a|Vitamin K2 (MK-7) has been shown to cause significant changes in different physiological processes and diseases, but its role in acute lung injury (ALI) is unclear. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to evaluate the protective effects of VK2 against LPS-induced ALI in mice. The male C57BL/6J mice were randomly divided into six groups (n = 7): the control group, LPS group, negative control group (LPS + Oil), positive control group (LPS + DEX), LPS + VK2 (L) group (VK2, 1.5 mg/kg), and LPS + VK2 (H) group (VK2, 15 mg/kg). Hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining of lung tissue was performed. Antioxidant superoxide dismutase (SOD) and total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) activities, and the Ca2+ level in the lung tissue were measured. The effects of VK2 on inflammation, apoptosis, tight junction (TJ) injury, mitochondrial dysfunction, and autophagy were quantitatively assessed using Western blot analysis. Compared with the LPS group, VK2 improved histopathological changes; alleviated inflammation, apoptosis, and TJ injury; increased antioxidant enzyme activity; reduced Ca2+ overload; regulated mitochondrial function; and inhibited lung autophagy. These results indicate that VK2 could improve tight junction protein loss, inflammation, and cell apoptosis in LPS-induced ALI by inhibiting the mitochondrial dysfunction and excessive autophagy, indicating that VK2 plays a beneficial role in ALI and might be a potential therapeutic strategy.
