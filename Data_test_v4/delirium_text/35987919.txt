35987919|a|This narrative review summarises ongoing challenges and progress in the care and prevention of fragility fractures across the Asia Pacific region since mid-2019. The approaches taken could inform development of national bone health improvement Road Maps to be implemented at scale during the United Nations 'Decade of Healthy Ageing'. PURPOSE: This narrative review summarises recent studies that characterise the burden of fragility fractures, current care gaps and quality improvement initiatives intended to improve the care and prevention of fragility fractures across the Asia Pacific region. METHODS: The review focuses on published studies, reports and quality improvement initiatives undertaken during the period July 2019 to May 2022. RESULTS: Epidemiological studies conducted in countries and regions throughout Asia Pacific highlight the current and projected increasing burden of fragility fractures. Recent studies and reports document a persistent and pervasive post-fracture care gap among people who have sustained fragility fractures. Global initiatives developed by the Fragility Fracture Network and International Osteoporosis Foundation have gained significant momentum in the Asia Pacific region, despite the disruption caused by the COVID-pandemic. The Asia Pacific Fragility Fracture Alliance has developed educational resources including a Hip Fracture Registry Toolbox and a Primary Care Physician Education Toolkit. The Asia Pacific Osteoporosis and Fragility Fractures Society-a new section of the Asia Pacific Orthopaedic Association-is working to engage orthopaedic surgeons across the region in the care and prevention of fragility fractures. The Asia Pacific Consortium on Osteoporosis developed a framework to support national clinical guidelines development groups. Considerable activity at the national level is evident in many countries across the region. CONCLUSION: Development and implementation of national Road Maps informed by the findings of this review are urgently required to respond to the epidemiological emergency posed by fragility fractures during the United Nations 'Decade of Healthy Ageing'.
