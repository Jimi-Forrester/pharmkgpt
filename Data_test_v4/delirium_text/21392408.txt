21392408|t|Do aromatase inhibitors have adverse effects on cognitive function?
21392408|a|Aromatase inhibitors are an important component of treatment for most postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive, early-stage breast cancer. Women taking aromatase inhibitors experience very low levels of circulating estrogen. This might be expected to result in cognitive dysfunction given the important relationship between estrogen and cognition in the basic science literature. Several studies have examined the cognitive effects of aromatase inhibitors, including two within large randomized trials which were adequately powered to detect moderate (but not small) effects. With this caveat, the available data do not support the hypothesis that aromatase inhibitors adversely affect cognitive function or that aromatase inhibitors might have a more adverse effect on cognitive function in comparison with tamoxifen. Further research is needed for confirmation.
