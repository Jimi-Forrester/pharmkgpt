21365564|a|Acute hepatic porphyrias stand for a group of rare genetic defects in the metabolism of heme biosynthesis, whereof acute intermittent porphyria is the most frequent one. Factors like drugs, infections, fasting, alcohol, or stress can provoke an acute crisis. The symptoms are very variable; however gastrointestinal and neuro-psychiatric symptoms are common. Furthermore darkening urine might be an important diagnostic sign. We describe the case of a 33-year-old psychiatric nurse presenting with stomach ache, hypertension, delirium and red spots in his underwear.
