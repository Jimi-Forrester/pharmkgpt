37429593|a|Background: Dysphagia is a common problem with potentially serious consequences including malnutrition, dehydration, pneumonia, and death. However, there are challenges in screening for dysphagia in older adults. We assessed the feasibility of using the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) as a risk assessment tool for dysphagia. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted at a tertiary teaching hospital from November 2021 to May 2022 and included 131 older patients (age >=65 years) admitted to acute wards. We used the eating assessment tool-10 (EAT-10), which is a simple measure for identifying individuals at risk of dysphagia, to assess the relationship between EAT-10 score and frailty status as measured using the CFS. Results: The mean age of the participants was 74.3 years (standard deviation, 6.7), and 44.3% were male. Twenty-nine (22.1%) participants had an EAT-10 score >=3. The CFS score was significantly associated with an EAT-10 score >=3 after adjusting for age and sex (odds ratio:1.48, 95% confidence interval [CI]:1.09-2.02). The CFS was able to classify the presence of an EAT-10 score >=3 (area under the receiver operating characteristic [ROC] curve=0.650, 95% CI:0. 544-0.756). The cutoff point for predicting an EAT-10 score >=3 was a CFS of 5 according to the highest Youden index, with a sensitivity of 82.8% and a specificity of 46.1%. The positive and negative predictive values were 30.4% and 90.4%, respectively. Conclusion: The CFS can be used as a tool to screen for the risk of swallowing difficulty in older inpatients to determine clinical management encompassing drug administration routes, nutritional support, prevention of dehydration, and further evaluation of dysphagia.
