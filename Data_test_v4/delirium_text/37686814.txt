37686814|a|The study aimed to analyse the macro- and micro-nutrient content in fruits of Rubus species (R. idaeus, R. occidentalis, R. chamaemorus, and R. chingii) and their varieties or hybrids from different regions. Flame atomic absorption spectrometry with deuterium background correction was used to measure concentrations of nine essential elements (K, Mg, Ca, Na, Mn, Fe, Cr, Zn, and Cu) and two heavy metals (Pb, Cd). Chemometric analysis compared the elemental profiles. Results confirmed raspberries as a rich source of macroelements (K, Mg) and microelements (Zn, Cu, Mn, Cr). The 'Bristol' cultivar consistently had the highest Fe content regardless of origin. Cr presence was observed in black raspberries for the first time. Previously observed relationships like K-Na antagonism and Cr/Zn, Fe/Zn synergism were found in raspberry fruits. Factor and cluster analyses demonstrated species and geographical diversity among Polish raspberry samples and clear separation of R. chingii from China. Raspberry fruits, due to the rich complex of polyphenols, are classified as superfoods, and the content of bioelements determined in them guarantees coverage of the daily requirement for macro- and microelements (RDA depending on the element: 5.6-204% for R. idaeus, 8.8-469, 4% for R. occidentalis, and 1.4-67.2% for R. chamaemorus), finally confirming this opinion.
