29170725|t|Reduction of Cognitive Decline in Patients with or at High Risk for Diabetes.
29170725|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The incidence of Alzheimer's disease and related disorders is expected to triple by 2050. People with type 2 diabetes and prediabetes have a higher risk of cognitive dysfunction, including Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia. Controversy remains about when and how to prevent and treat cognitive dysfunction in people with or at high risk of diabetes. RECENT FINDINGS: In our review of ongoing clinical trials, we have found that there has been an increase in the number of studies assessing the efficacy of pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches to prevent or slow down cognitive impairment among people with or at high risk of diabetes. SUMMARY: Despite the considerable risk of cognitive impairment in people with diabetes and prediabetes, there is not enough evidence to support a specific treatment to prevent or slow mild cognitive impairment, or progression to Alzheimer's disease or related disorders. Several ongoing trials are attempting to identify the usefulness of several compounds, as well as lifestyle changes including exercise and diet. Direct mechanisms linking diabetes to cognitive decline have not been elucidated.
