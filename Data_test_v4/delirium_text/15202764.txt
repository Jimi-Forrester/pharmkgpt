15202764|a|The damaging effect of aluminum ions (Al3+) on the organism is widely investigated in clinics and experiments that indicate its role as a participant in the synthesis of precursors for amyloid proteins and as a potential agent in the ethiology of Alzheimer's disease. It has been shown that Al produces neurotoxic effects. We established that AlCl3 produces degenerative changes in the ultrastructure of Hasserian neurinoma cells in vitro and in L929 fibroblast cells. Proline-rich peptide-1 (PRP-1) isolated from neurosecretory granules of bovine neurohypophysis is a potent antineurodegenerative agent against spinal cord hemisection and crush syndrome-induced neurodegeneration of brain and spinal cord neurons. PRP-1 is one of the neurotrophic brain factors. By electron microscopic study of the rat hippocampus and other tissues, we succeeded in visualizing the epithelioprotectory effect of PRP-1, contributing as a powerful agent in removal of aluminum accumulation in different tissues in experimental aluminum neurotoxicosis.
