31366079|t|Comparison between Post-Operative Analgesic Efficacy of Low-Concentration High-Volume and High-Concentration Low-Volume Combinations of Ropivacaine for Transverse Abdominis Plane Block in Pediatric Open Inguinal Hernia Repair.
31366079|a|Transverse abdominis plane (TAP) block can provide post-operative analgesia in children undergoing open inguinal hernia repair. However, the optimal anesthetic dose, and concentration for TAP block in the pediatric population, is not well defined. This study compared the post-operative analgesic effect of TAP block between low-concentration, with high-volume (LCHV) and high-concentration, with low-volume (HCLV) combinations of local anesthetic. Forty-four patients who underwent open inguinal hernia repair were randomly assigned to two groups. The patients in the LCHV group received 0.67 mL/kg of 0.15% ropivacaine. Whereas, those in the HCLV group received 0.4 mL/kg of 0.25% ropivacaine. Both groups received the same amount of ropivacaine (1 mg/kg). The primary outcome measure was the face, leg, activity, cry, consolability (FLACC) scale score at post-anesthetic care unit (PACU; T1). FLACC scale score at T1 was significantly lower in the HCLV group (2.91 versus 1.43; mean difference, -1.49; 95% confidence interval, -0.0245 to -2.936; p = 0.0464). FLACC scale scores one hour and six hours after the surgery were not different between the two groups. This study reports better post-operative analgesic effects after unilateral open inguinal hernia repair with 1 mg/kg of 0.25% ropivacaine than 1 mg/kg of 0.15% ropivacaine at PACU.
