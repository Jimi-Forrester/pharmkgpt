30950385|t|The Perioperative Care of Older Patients.
30950385|a|BACKGROUND: Elderly patients are a growing and vulnerable group with an elevated perioperative risk. Perioperative treatment pathways that take these patients' special risks and requirements into account are often not implemented in routine clinical practice. METHODS: This review is based on pertinent publications retrieved by a selective search in PubMed, the AWMF guideline database, and the Cochrane database for guidelines from Germany and abroad, meta-analyses, and Cochrane reviews. RESULTS: The care of elderly patients who need surgery calls for an interdisciplinary, interprofessional treatment concept. One component of this concept is preoperative preparation of the patient ("prehabilitation"), which is best initiated before hospital admission, e.g., correction of deficiency states, optimization of chronic drug treatment, and respiratory training. Another important component consists of pre-, intra-, and postoperative measures to prevent delirium, which can lower the frequency of this complication by 30-50%: these include orientation aids, avoidance of inappropriate drugs for elderly patients, adequate analgesia, early mobilization, short fasting times, and a perioperative nutrition plan. Preexisting cognitive impairment predisposes to postoperative delirium (odds ratios [OR] ranging from 2.5 to 4.5). Frailty is the most important predictor of the postoperative course (OR: 2.6-11). It follows that preoperative assessment of the patient's functional and cognitive status is essential. CONCLUZION: The evidence-based and guideline-consistent care of elderly patients requires not only close interdisciplinary, interprofessional, and cross-sectoral collaboration, but also the restructuring and optimization of habitual procedural pathways in the hospital. Elderly patients' special needs can only be met by a treatment concept in which the entire perioperative phase is considered as a single, coherent process.
