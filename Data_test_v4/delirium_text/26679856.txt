26679856|t|The Relationship Between Plasma Abeta Levels, Cognitive Function and Brain Volumetrics: Sydney Memory and Ageing Study.
26679856|a|OBJECTIVES: Determine whether (1) a relationship exists between plasma amyloid-beta (Abeta)1- 40 and 1-42 peptide levels, brain volumetrics and cognitive performance in elderly individuals with and without amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), (2) plasma Abeta peptide levels differ between apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon4 carriers and non-carriers and (3) longitudinal changes in cognition and brain volume relate to Abeta levels. METHODS: Subjects with aMCI (n = 89) and normal cognition (n = 126) were drawn from the Sydney Memory and Aging Study (Sydney MAS), a population based study of non-demented 70-90 year old individuals; 39 Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients were recruited from a specialty clinic. Sydney MAS participants underwent brain MRI scans and were assessed on 19 cognitive measures and were APOE epsilon4 genotyped. Plasma levels of Abeta1-40 and 1-42 were quantified using ELISA. RESULTS: Wave1 plasma levels of Abeta peptides and Abeta1-42/1-40 ratio were lower in aMCI and AD, and Abeta1-42 was positively associated with global cognition and hippocampal volume and negatively with white matter hyperintensities. The relationships of Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42 were predominantly observed in epsilon4 allele carriers and non-carriers respectively. Longitudinal analysis revealed greater decline in global cognition and memory for the highest quintiles of Abeta1-42 and the ratio measure. CONCLUSION: Plasma Abeta levels and the Abeta1-42/1-40 ratio are related to cognition and hippocampal volumes, with differential associations of Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42 in epsilon4 carriers and non-carriers. These data support the Abeta sink model of AD pathology, and suggest that plasma Abeta measures may serve as biomarkers of AD.
