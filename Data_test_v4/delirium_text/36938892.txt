36938892|a|Treatments for adults with newly-diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) may be prohibitively toxic and/or resource-intense. To address this, we performed a phase II study of dose-adjusted etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin (DA-EPOCH). Imatinib or dasatinib was added for Ph + disease; rituximab was added when CD20+. Fifty-three patients were evaluable: 28 with Ph + disease, and 25 with Ph-. All patients had >=1 high-risk clinical feature. Measurable residual disease-negativity by multiparameter flow cytometry within 4 cycles was achieved in 71% in patients with Ph + ALL and 64% in Ph - ALL. Median overall survival (OS) was 49 months, with a 2-year OS of 71%. Median relapse-free survival (RFS) in the 47 patients that attained morphologic remission was 24 months, with a 2-year RFS of 57%. Early mortality was 2%. In summary, DA-EPOCH yields deep and durable remissions in adults with ALL comparable to some resource-intense strategies but with a low rate of treatment-related death.
