32859769|a|Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a combination of severe motor and non-motor symptoms. Over the years, several factors have been discovered to play a role in the pathogenesis of this disease, in particular, neuroinflammation and oxidative stress. To date, the pharmacological treatments used in Parkinson's disease are exclusively symptomatic. For this reason, in recent years, the research has been directed towards the discovery and study of new natural molecules to develop potential neuroprotective therapies against Parkinson's disease. In this context, natural polyphenols have raised much attention for their important anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, but also for their ability to modulate protein misfolding. In this review, we propose to summarize the relevant in vivo and in vitro studies concerning the potential therapeutic role of natural polyphenols in Parkinson's disease.
