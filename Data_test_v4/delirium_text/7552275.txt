7552275|a|Levels of the calcium mobilising receptors for the phosphoinositide hydrolysis derived second messengers, inositol(1,4,5)trisphosphate [Ins(1,4,5)P3] and inositol(1,3,4,5) tetrakis-phosphate [Ins(1,3,4,5)P4] were compared in the cerebellum, superior temporal and superior frontal cortex of a series of Alzheimer's disease and matched control cases. Membrane [3H]Ins(1,4,5)P3 radioligand binding experiments performed under steady state conditions revealed that the number of Ins(1,4,5)P3 recognition sites was significantly decreased in all three brain regions of the Alzheimer's disease cases, compared to controls. In contrast, [3H]Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 binding levels, as assessed in competition analyses, were not significantly different between the groups in any brain region. Moreover, the Hill coefficients for inhibition of [3H]Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 binding by non-radioactive Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 were less than unity in both the control and Alzheimer's disease brains, suggesting that the heterogeneity of these binding sites are also maintained in the disease. It is concluded that disruptions of the phosphoinositide hydrolysis pathway in Alzheimer's disease brain are associated with a selective loss of calcium mobilising Ins(1,4,5)P3, but not Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 receptor sites. These alterations may contribute to an altered calcium homeostasis in Alzheimer's disease, as well as providing one reason for the lack of success of cholinergic replacement therapies aimed at enhancing muscarinic receptor-mediated phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis.
