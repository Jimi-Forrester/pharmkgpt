36832039|t|SERS Determination of Oxidative Stress Markers in Saliva Using Substrates with Silver Nanoparticle-Decorated Silicon Nanowires.
36832039|a|Glutathione and malondialdehyde are two compounds commonly used to evaluate the oxidative stress status of an organism. Although their determination is usually performed in blood serum, saliva is gaining ground as the biological fluid of choice for oxidative stress determination at the point of need. For this purpose, surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), which is a highly sensitive method for the detection of biomolecules, could offer additional advantages regarding the analysis of biological fluids at the point of need. In this work, silicon nanowires decorated with silver nanoparticles made by metal-assisted chemical etching were evaluated as substrates for the SERS determination of glutathione and malondialdehyde in water and saliva. In particular, glutathione was determined by monitoring the reduction in the Raman signal obtained from substrates modified with crystal violet upon incubation with aqueous glutathione solutions. On the other hand, malondialdehyde was detected after a reaction with thiobarbituric acid to produce a derivative with a strong Raman signal. The detection limits achieved after optimization of several assay parameters were 50 and 3.2 nM for aqueous solutions of glutathione and malondialdehyde, respectively. In artificial saliva, however, the detection limits were 2.0 and 0.32 muM for glutathione and malondialdehyde, respectively, which are, nonetheless, adequate for the determination of these two markers in saliva.
