33011615|t|Spatiotemporal relationship between subthreshold amyloid accumulation and aerobic glycolysis in the human brain.
33011615|a|In Alzheimer's disease, brain amyloid deposition has a distinct topography that correlates with aerobic glycolysis (AG), that is, the use of glucose beyond that predicted by oxygen consumption. The causes for this relationship remain unclear but might provide crucialinsight into how amyloid deposition begins. Here we develop methods to study the earliest topography of amyloid deposition based on amyloid imaging and investigate its spatiotemporal evolution with respect to the topography of AG in adults. We find that the spatiotemporal dynamics of amyloid deposition are largely explained by 1 factor, defined here as the amyloid topography dissimilarity index (ATDI). ATDI is bimodal, more highly dynamic during early amyloid accumulation, and predicts which individuals will cross a conservative quantitative threshold at least 3-5 years in advance. Using ATDI, we demonstrate that subthreshold amyloid accumulates primarily in regions that have high AG during early adulthood. Our findings suggest that early on-target subthreshold amyloid deposition mirrors its later regional pattern, which best corresponds to the topography of young adult brain AG.
