17712100|t|Symptom profile of delirium in older people with and without dementia.
17712100|a|Clinical profiles of delirium in 717 older people with and without dementia age 75 years and older in 4 different types of care were studied. Delirium and dementia were diagnosed according to DSM-IV criteria. Delirious demented participants (n = 135) had more often had previous delirium episodes and were more often being treated with analgesics compared to delirious participants without dementia (n = 180). The clinical profile of delirium in the participants with dementia was more frequently characterized by aggressivity, latency in reaction to verbal stimuli, restlessness and agitation, delusions, anxiousness, hallucinations, and a poorer orientation and recognition. Delirium among demented participants more often had a fluctuating course during the day and was more common in the evening and at night. In conclusion, clinical profiles of delirium in participants with and without dementia are different, which might indicate a different etiology or pathophysiology, or both, and a need for different treatment strategies.
