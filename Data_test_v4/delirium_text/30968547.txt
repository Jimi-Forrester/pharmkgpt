30968547|a|Cellular architectural proteins often participate in organ development and maintenance. Although functional decay of some of these proteins during aging is known, the cell-type-specific developmental role and the cause and consequence of their subsequent decay remain to be established especially in mammals. By studying lamins, the nuclear structural proteins, we demonstrate that lamin-B1 functions specifically in the thymic epithelial cells (TECs) for proper thymus organogenesis. An up-regulation of proinflammatory cytokines in the intra-thymic myeloid immune cells during aging accompanies a gradual reduction of lamin-B1 in adult TECs. We show that these cytokines can cause senescence and lamin-B1 reduction of the young adult TECs. Lamin-B1 supports the expression of TEC genes that can help maintain the adult TEC subtypes we identified by single-cell RNA-sequencing, thymic architecture, and function. Thus, structural proteins involved in organ building and maintenance can undergo inflammation-driven decay which can in turn contribute to age-associated organ degeneration.
