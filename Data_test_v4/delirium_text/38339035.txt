38339035|t|Presenilin: A Multi-Functional Molecule in the Pathogenesis of Alzheimer's Disease and Other Neurodegenerative Diseases.
38339035|a|Presenilin, a transmembrane protein primarily known for its role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) as part of the gamma-secretase complex, has garnered increased attention due to its multifaceted functions in various cellular processes. Recent investigations have unveiled a plethora of functions beyond its amyloidogenic role. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of presenilin's diverse roles in AD and other neurodegenerative disorders. It includes a summary of well-known substrates of presenilin, such as its involvement in amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing and Notch signaling, along with other functions. Additionally, it highlights newly discovered functions, such as trafficking function, regulation of ferritin expression, apolipoprotein E (ApoE) secretion, the interaction of ApoE and presenilin, and the Abeta42-to-Abeta40-converting activity of ACE. This updated perspective underscores the evolving landscape of presenilin research, emphasizing its broader impact beyond established pathways. The incorporation of these novel findings accentuates the dynamic nature of presenilin's involvement in cellular processes, further advancing our comprehension of its multifaceted roles in neurodegenerative disorders. By synthesizing evidence from a range of studies, this review sheds light on the intricate web of presenilin functions and their implications in health and disease.
