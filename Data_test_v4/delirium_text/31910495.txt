31910495|t|Survey of analgesia and sedation in pediatric intensive care units in Japan.
31910495|a|BACKGROUND: High-quality evidence of analgesia and sedation management in pediatric intensive care units (PICUs) is lacking. METHODS: An online survey concerning the institutional management of pain, sedation, delirium, and withdrawal syndrome, as well as non-pharmacological interventions to reduce pain and / or to provide comfort, was conducted with the medical directors of 31 PICUs in Japan. The survey was conducted from September to November 2016. RESULTS: The response rate was 77% (24/31). Pain was routinely assessed in nine (38%) PICUs. Self-report pain scales were used in 14 (58%) PICUs. Observational pain scales for children who were unable to self-report were used in only one PICU. Physician-driven analgesia protocols were used in two (8%) PICUs. Although sedation scales for intubated patients were used in 15 (63%) PICUs, they were used for the goal-directed sedation management in nine (38%). Nurse-driven sedation protocols were used in two (8%) PICUs. Five (21%) PICUs used delirium assessment tools, and delirium screening was not routinely done in any PICU. Five (21%) PICUs regularly used withdrawal assessment tools for a high-risk group of patients with withdrawal syndrome. Non-pharmacological interventions for analgesia and comfort were frequently practiced for mechanically ventilated patients. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first survey conducted by physicians regarding pain and agitation management in PICUs in Japan, and the results revealed great diversity in practice. The implementation strategies to assess pain, delirium, and withdrawal syndrome, as well as to set goals regarding sedation level, are lacking. Protocols for analgesia and sedation management are uncommon.
