22898367|t|A perioperative infusion of sodium bicarbonate does not improve renal function in cardiac surgery patients: a prospective observational cohort study.
22898367|a|INTRODUCTION: Cardiac-surgery-associated-acute-kidney-injury (CSA-AKI) is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Recent data from patients undergoing on-pump coronary artery bypass grafting suggest that a perioperative infusion of sodium-bicarbonate may decrease the incidence of CSA-AKI. The present study aims to analyze the renoprotective effects of a 24h infusion of sodium-bicarbonate in a large, heterogeneous group of cardiac surgical patients METHODS: Starting in 4/2009, all patients undergoing cardiac surgery at our institution were enrolled in a prospective trial analyzing the relationship between preoperative cerebral oxygen saturation and postoperative organ dysfunction. We used this prospectively sampled data set to perform a cohort analysis of the renoprotective efficiency of a 24h continuous perioperative infusion of sodium-bicarbonate on the incidence of CSA-AKI that was routinely introduced in 7/2009. After exclusion of patients with endstage chronic kidney disease, off-pump procedures, and emergency cases, perioperative changes in renal function were assessed in 280 patients treated with a perioperative infusion of 4 mmol sodium-bicarbonate / kg body weight in comparison with a control cohort of 304 patients enrolled from April to June in this prospective cohort study. RESULTS: With the exception of a lower prevalence of a history of myocardial infarction and a lower preoperative use of intravenous heparin in the bicarbonate-group, no significant between group differences in patient demographics, surgical risk, type, and duration of surgery were observed. Patients in the bicarbonate group had a lower mean arterial blood pressure after induction of anesthesia, needed more fluids, more vasopressors, and a longer treatment time in the high dependency unit. Despite a higher postoperative diuresis, no differences in the incidence of AKI grade 1 to 3 and the need for renal replacement were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Routine perioperative administration of sodium bicarbonate failed to improve postoperative renal function in a large population of cardiac surgical patients.
