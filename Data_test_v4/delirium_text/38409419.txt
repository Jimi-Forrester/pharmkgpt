38409419|a|A critical aspect of cognition is the ability to acquire, consolidate, and evoke memories, which is considerably impaired by neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. These mnemonic processes are dependent on signaling cascades, which involve protein expression and degradation. Recent mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics has opened a range of possibilities for the study of memory formation and impairment, making it possible to research protein systems not studied before. However, in the context of synaptic proteome related to learning processes and memory formation, a deeper understanding of the synaptic proteome temporal dynamics after induction of synaptic plasticity and the molecular changes underlying the cognitive deficits seen in neurodegenerative diseases is needed. This review analyzes the applications of proteomics for understanding memory processes in both normal and neurodegenerative conditions. Moreover, the most critical experimental studies have been summarized using the PANTHER overrepresentation test. Finally, limitations associated with investigations of memory studies in physiological and neurodegenerative disorders have also been discussed.
