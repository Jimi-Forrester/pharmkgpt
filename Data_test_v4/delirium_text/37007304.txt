37007304|t|A Patient With Mental Disorder Wrongly Detained in a European Migrant Detention Centre.
37007304|a|The admission of undocumented migrants and refugees to detention centres (DC) has been systematically associated with several poor mental health outcomes. Much less is known about people with mental health disorders, non-migrants, who might be wrongfully committed to these facilities. This article draws on Dave's case, where a German citizen was detained in a migrant DC in Porto. The patient was later treated and diagnosed with schizophrenia. In light of another case report, we conceptualize the "Cornelia's phenomenon" by which a person with full citizenship rights but with a severe mental disorder is wrongly committed to a DC. We hypothesize that this worrisome phenomenon is underestimated, and we will discuss how pre-existent psychopathology might predispose vulnerable people to this situation. We will discuss the negative impact that detention might have on these patients, proposing solutions that might amend this worrisome phenomenon.
