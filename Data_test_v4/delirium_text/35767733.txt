35767733|a|Toxic air pollutants are one of the most agent that have many acute, chronic and non-communicable diseases (NCDs) on human health under long or short-term exposure has been raised from the past to the present. The aim of this study was investigation effect of long-term exposure to toxic air pollutants on the increased risk of malignant brain tumors. Databases used to for searched were the PubMed, Web of Science, Springer and Science Direct (Scopus) and Google Scholar. 71 papers based on abstract and article text filtered. In the end after sieve we selected 7 papers. Identify all relevant studies published 1970-2022. The literature showed that exposure to toxic air pollutants and their respiration can cause disorders in different parts of the brain by transmission through the circulatory system and other mechanisms. Various unpleasant abnormalities are caused by the inhalation of toxic air pollutants in the human body that some of the most common of them include chronic lung disease, coronary heart disease and heart attacks, strokes and brain diseases (Parkinson's, Alzheimer's and multiple Sclerosis), cancers (liver, blood, prostate and brain) and eventually death. According to the finding brain health and proper functioning can be easily disrupted by various genetic or external factors such as air pollution, causing a wide range of abnormalities in the brain and malignant brain tumors. The results of this study showed that reducing the concentration of toxic pollutants in the air, that exposure to them play an increasing role in the development of brain diseases can slow down the process of abnormalities in the brain and will have significant impacts on reducing the number of people affected by them.
