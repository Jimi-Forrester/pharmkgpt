31557623|a|Designing small molecule inhibitors targeting cholinesterases (ChEs) is considered as an efficient strategy for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the present study, based on a shaped-based pharmacophore (SBP) model that we reported previously, virtual screening was performed on four commercial compound databases, from which eight small molecules containing new structurally scaffolds were retained and evaluated. In general, six of these potential hits were identified to be selective ChEs inhibitors. Three compounds exhibited IC50 values and Ki values in micromolar range on acetylcholinesterase (AChE), the most active compound 4 showed IC50 value of 6.31 +- 2.68 muM and Ki value of 4.76 muM. Other three compounds displayed IC50 values and Ki values in micromolar range on butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) with high target selectivity, the most active compound 1 showed IC50 value of 3.87 +- 2.48 muM and Ki value of 1.52 muM. Multiple biological evaluations were performed to determine their cytotoxicity, cyto-protective effects, antioxidant effect as well as druglike properties. These compounds provide new cores for the further design and optimization, with the aim to discover new ChEs inhibitors for the treatment of AD.
