39466447|t|The Role of Non-Coding RNAs in Mitochondrial Dysfunction of Alzheimer's Disease.
39466447|a|Although brain amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide buildup is the main cause of Alzheimer's disease (AD), mitochondrial abnormalities can also contribute to the illness's development, as either a primary or secondary factor, as programmed cell death and efficient energy generation depend on the proper operation of mitochondria. As a result, non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) may play a crucial role in ensuring that nuclear genes related to mitochondria and mitochondrial genes function normally. Interestingly, a significant number of recent studies have focused on the impact of ncRNAs on the expression of nucleus and mitochondrial genes. Additionally, researchers have proposed some intriguing therapeutic approaches to treat and reduce the severity of AD by adjusting the levels of these ncRNAs. The goal of this work was to consolidate the existing knowledge in this field of study by systematically investigating ncRNAs, with a particular emphasis on microRNAs (miRNAs), long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), circular RNAs (circRNAs), and small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs). Therefore, the impact and processes by which ncRNAs govern mitochondrial activity in the onset and progression of AD are thoroughly reviewed in this article. Collectively, the effects of ncRNAs on physiological and molecular mechanisms associated with mitochondrial abnormalities that exacerbate AD are thoroughly reviewed in the current research, while also emphasizing the relationship between disturbed mitophagy in AD and ncRNAs.
