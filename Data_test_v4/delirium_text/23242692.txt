23242692|a|Soluble aggregated forms of amyloid-beta protein (Abeta) have garnered significant attention recently for their role in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Protofibrils are a subset of these soluble species and are considered intermediates in the aggregation pathway to mature Abeta fibrils. Biological studies have demonstrated that protofibrils exhibit both toxic and inflammatory activities. It is important in these in vitro studies to prepare protofibrils using solution conditions that are appropriate for cellular studies as well as conducive to biophysical characterization of protofibrils. Here we describe the preparation and characterization of Abeta(1-42) protofibrils in modified artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) and demonstrate their prominent binding and activation of microglial cells. A simple phosphate/bicarbonate buffer system was prepared that maintained the ionic strength and cell compatibility of F-12 medium but did not contain numerous supplements that interfere with spectroscopic analyses of Abeta protofibrils. Reconstitution of Abeta(1-42) in aCSF and isolation with size exclusion chromatography (SEC) revealed curvilinear beta-sheet protofibrils <100 nm in length and hydrodynamic radii of 21 nm. Protofibril concentration determination by BCA assay, which was not possible in F-12 medium, was more accurately measured in aCSF. Protofibrils formed and isolated in aCSF, but not monomers, markedly stimulated TNFalpha production in BV-2 and primary microglia and bound in significant amounts to microglial membranes. This report demonstrates the suitability of a modified aCSF system for preparing SEC-isolated Abeta(1-42) protofibrils and underscores the unique ability of protofibrils to functionally interact with microglia.
