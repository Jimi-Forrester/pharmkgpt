36142904|t|Prevalence and Long-Term Prognosis of Post-Intensive Care Syndrome after Sepsis: A Single-Center Prospective Observational Study.
36142904|a|Post-intensive care syndrome (PICS) comprises physical, mental, and cognitive disorders following a severe illness. The impact of PICS on long-term prognosis has not been fully investigated. This study aimed to: (1) clarify the frequency and clinical characteristics of PICS in sepsis patients and (2) explore the relationship between PICS occurrence and 2-year survival. Patients with sepsis admitted to intensive care unit were enrolled. Data on patient background; clinical information since admission; physical, mental, and cognitive impairments at 3-, 6-, and 12-months post-sepsis onset; 2-year survival; and cause of death were obtained from electronic medical records and telephonic interviews with patients and their families. At 3 months, comparisons of variables were undertaken in the PICS group and the non-PICS group. Among the 77 participants, the in-hospital mortality rate was 11% and the 2-year mortality rate was 52%. The frequencies of PICS at 3, 6, and 12 months were 70%, 60%, and 35%, respectively. The 2-year survival was lower in the PICS group than in the non-PICS group (54% vs. 94%, p < 0.01). More than half of the survivors had PICS at 3 and 6 months after sepsis. Among survivors with sepsis, those who developed PICS after 3 months had a lower 2-year survival.
