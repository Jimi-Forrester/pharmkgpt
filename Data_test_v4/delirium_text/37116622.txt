37116622|t|An updated Barnes maze protocol for assessing the outcome of controlled cortical impact mouse models of traumatic brain injury.
37116622|a|BACKGROUND: The Barnes Maze (BM) is a common method of testing cognitive deficits in rodents. Adapting BM protocols for specific neurological disorders could potentially aid in more effective testing, reduce research time, and help decrease variability between studies. NEW METHOD: We tested differences an updated, shortened BM consisting of 6 days, 3 trials per day, only covering the equivalent of the spatial acquisition week BM protocol and a probe trial day consisting of one trial (7 total days). RESULTS: Kaplan-Meier plots of escape percentage as a function of total latency showed a significant difference between control and CCI mice in the updated protocol on days 3 through 6. Additionally, probe trial data showed significant differences in primary latency, primary errors, and returns to goal. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS: We tested differences between a traditional 5 days per week, 2 trials per day, spatial acquisition and reversal weeks BM protocol (12 total days with probe trials) with an updated 6-day BM protocol (7 total days with probe trial). In the probe trial, the updated protocol control mice showed an over 5-fold decrease in primary latency and primary errors and a 4.6-fold increase in returns to goal compared to the traditional protocol. Additionally, mice in both protocols performed similarly on a trial-by-trial basis suggesting that the changes made for the updated protocol increased learning and memory and was not simply an easier task. CONCLUSION: The updated BM protocol showed an improved ability to distinguish between control and CCI mice and promoted improved and more consistent learning for both the control and CCI groups.
