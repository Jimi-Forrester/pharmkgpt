32366995|a|Malnutrition predicts poorer clinical outcomes for people with cancer. Older adults with cancer are a complex, growing population at high risk of weight-losing conditions. A number of malnutrition screening tools exist, however the best screening tool for this group is unknown. The aim was to systematically review the published evidence regarding markers and measures of nutritional status in older adults with cancer (age >= 70). A systematic search was performed in Ovid Medline, EMBASE, Web of Science, CINAHL, British Nursing Database and Cochrane CENTRAL; search terms related to malnutrition, cancer, older adults. Titles, abstracts and papers were screened and quality-appraised. Data evaluating ability of markers of nutritional status to predict patient outcomes were subjected to meta-analysis or narrative synthesis. Forty-two studies, describing 15 markers were included. Meta-analysis found decreased food intake was associated with mortality (OR 2.15 [2.03-4.20] p = < 0.00001) in univariate analysis. Prognostic Nutritional Index (PNI) was associated with overall survival (HR 1.89 [1.03-3.48] p = 0.04). PNI markers (albumin, total lymphocyte count) could be seen as markers of inflammation rather than nutrition. There a suggested relationship between very low body mass index (BMI) (<18 kg/m2) and clinical outcomes. No tool was identified as appropriate to screen for malnutrition, as distinct from inflammatory causes of weight-loss. Risk of cancer-cachexia and sarcopenia in older adults with cancer limits the tools analysed. Measures of food intake predicted mortality and should be included in clinical enquiry. A screening tool that distinguishes between malnutrition, cachexia and sarcopenia in older adults with cancer is needed.
