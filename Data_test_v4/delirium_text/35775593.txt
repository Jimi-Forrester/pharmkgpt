35775593|t|Sjogren's syndrome.
35775593|a|Sjogren's syndrome (SjS) is an autoimmune disease characterized by the triad of sicca symptoms, fatigue and pain. This diagnosis is usually made in women at the average age of 60 years. Diagnosis is made when sicca symptoms persist for more than three months, after the exclusion of possible differential diagnoses, and using the ACR/EULAR 2016 classification criteria for SjS. Many organs can be affected in the course of this disease. Xerosis cutis and pruritus are the most common skin manifestations, followed by leukocytoclastic vasculitis and subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus. In addition, SjS patients often have myoarthralgia and neuropsychiatric symptoms. In the long term, attention must be paid to the increased risk of cardiovascular disease and lymphoma. Due to the multiorgan involvement in SjS patients, interdisciplinary care is required.
