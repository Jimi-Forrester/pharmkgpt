35053402|t|Implication of Adult Hippocampal Neurogenesis in Alzheimer's Disease and Potential Therapeutic Approaches.
35053402|a|Alzheimer's disease is the most common neurodegenerative disease, affecting more than 6 million US citizens and representing the most prevalent cause for dementia. Neurogenesis has been repeatedly reported to be impaired in AD mouse models, but the reason for this impairment remains unclear. Several key factors play a crucial role in AD including Abeta accumulation, intracellular neurofibrillary tangles accumulation, and neuronal loss (specifically in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus). Neurofibrillary tangles have been long associated with the neuronal loss in the dentate gyrus. Of note, Abeta accumulation plays an important role in the impairment of neurogenesis, but recent studies started to shed a light on the role of APP gene expression on the neurogenesis process. In this review, we will discuss the recent approaches to neurogenesis in Alzheimer disease and update the development of therapeutic methods.
