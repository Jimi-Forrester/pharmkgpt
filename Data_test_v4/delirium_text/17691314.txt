17691314|t|Vagus nerve stimulation: indications and limitations.
17691314|a|Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is an established treatment for selected patients with medically refractory seizures. Recent studies suggest that VNS could be potentially useful in the treatment of resistant depressive disorder. Although a surgical procedure is required in order to implant the VNS device, the possibility of a long-term benefit largely free of severe side effects could give VNS a privileged place in the management of resistant depression. In addition, VNS appears to affect pain perception in depressed adults; a possible role of VNS in the treatment of severe refractory headache, intractable chronic migraine and cluster headache has also been suggested. VNS is currently investigated in clinical studies, as a potential treatment for essential tremor, cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease, anxiety disorders, and bulimia. Finally, other studies explore the potential use of VNS in the treatment of resistant obesity, addictions, sleep disorders, narcolepsy, coma and memory and learning deficits.
