32018069|t|Dopaminergic Hyperactivity in Neurological Patients with Delirium.
32018069|a|BACKGROUND: Delirium has important etiological, prognostic, and therapeutic implications. The study of neurochemical markers in this condition is relevant to the understanding of its pathophysiology. The assessment of the dopamine system is particularly relevant, as dopamine antagonists are the most used drugs in delirium. AIM: To analyze neurotransmission markers in patients with delirium, focusing in the dopamine metabolite, homovanillic acid. METHODS: A case-control study was performed at the National Institute of Neurology and Neurosurgery, Mexico, including hospitalized patients in which lumbar puncture was obtained for diagnostic purposes. Cases were selected if they fulfilled DSM-5 criteria for delirium. Age-paired controls were patients in which delirium was ruled out, selected at the same clinical scenario, during the same period. Neurological and systemic diagnoses were registered. Delirium was assessed using the DRS-98-R instrument. The dopamine metabolite, homovanillic acid (HVA), was measured by means of high-performance liquid chromatography. Other neurotransmission markers were also measured (5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, glutamate, aspartate, GABA, glycine, arginine, citrulline, nitrites, and nitrates). A logistic regression model was used to determine pathogenic factors associated with the presence of delirium. RESULTS: 68 neurological patients with delirium and 68 patients without delirium were included. Higher homovanillic acid levels in cerebrospinal fluid were significantly associated with delirium. This result was significant after a subanalysis in patients without exposure to antipsychotics. Male gender and autoimmune limbic encephalitis were also associated with the presence of delirium. CONCLUSIONS: In hospitalized neurological patients, dopaminergic hyperactivity and autoimmune limbic encephalitis are pathogenic factors associated with the presence of delirium.
