37867176|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the predominant impairment of neurons in the hippocampus and the formation of amyloid plaques, hyperphosphorylated tau protein, and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. The overexpression of amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP) in an AD brain results in the binding of APP intracellular domain (AICD) to Fe65 protein via the C-terminal Fe65-PTB2 interaction, which then triggers the secretion of amyloid-beta and the consequent pathogenesis of AD. Apparently, targeting the interaction between APP and Fe65 can offer a promising therapeutic approach for AD. Recently, exosome, a type of extracellular vesicle with diameter around 30-200 nm, has gained much attention as a potential delivery tool for brain diseases, including AD, due to their ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, their efficient uptake by autologous cells, and their ability to be surface-modified with target-specific receptor ligands. Here, the engineering of hippocampus neuron cell-derived exosomes to overexpress Fe65, enabled the development of a novel exosome-based targeted drug delivery system, which carried Corynoxine-B (Cory-B, an autophagy inducer) to the APP overexpressed-neuron cells in the brain of AD mice. The Fe65-engineered HT22 hippocampus neuron cell-derived exosomes (Fe65-EXO) loaded with Cory-B (Fe65-EXO-Cory-B) hijacked the signaling and blocked the natural interaction between Fe65 and APP, enabling APP-targeted delivery of Cory-B. Notably, Fe65-EXO-Cory-B induced autophagy in APP-expressing neuronal cells, leading to amelioration of the cognitive decline and pathogenesis in AD mice, demonstrating the potential of Fe65-EXO-Cory-B as an effective therapeutic intervention for AD.
