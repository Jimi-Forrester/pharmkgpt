36106360|t|Metal-Organic Frameworks and Their Composites for Environmental Applications.
36106360|a|From the point of view of the ecological environment, contaminants such as heavy metal ions or toxic gases have caused harmful impacts on the environment and human health, and overcoming these adverse effects remains a serious and important task. Very recent, highly crystalline porous metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), with tailorable chemistry and excellent chemical stability, have shown promising properties in the field of removing various hazardous pollutants. This review concentrates on the recent progress of MOFs and MOF-based materials and their exploit in environmental applications, mainly including water treatment and gas storage and separation. Finally, challenges and trends of MOFs and MOF-based materials for future developments are discussed and explored.
