36818753|t|Phenomenology and Physiology of Tacrolimus Induced Tremor.
36818753|a|Background: Tacrolimus is a potent immunosuppressant drug commonly used after solid organ transplant surgery. The use of this drug is frequently associated with the emergence of tremors. There is little information on the clinical and physiological characteristics of tacrolimus-induced tremors. Characterizing these tremors is essential as they can promote the development of specific therapies. Methods: We describe four patients placed on tacrolimus immunosuppressant therapy following kidney transplant surgery and who developed tremors impacting their daily functional activities. We describe the clinical and physiological characteristics of the tremor and the response generated after a limb cooling test. Results: A postural and kinetic tremor mainly involving the distal hands was observed in our cohort. In the accelerometer-based assessment, the tremor amplitude was noted to be mild to moderate, and the frequency was 5-6 Hz. Cooling the forearm and the hand led to a temporary albeit significant reduction of tremor amplitude (p = 0.03). Limb cooling lowered the tremor frequency by 1 Hz in two patients with no change in the other two patients, and the statistical comparison was not significant (p > 0.05). Conclusions: Limb cooling may be pursued as a therapeutic option for addressing tacrolimus-induced tremor, as the patients in our cohort benefitted from temporary tremor suppression.
