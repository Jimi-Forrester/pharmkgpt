37550066|a|Dietary polyphenols have beneficial effects in situations of impaired cognition in acute models of neurodegeneration. The possibility that they may have a direct effect on the electrical activity of neuronal populations has not been tested. We explored the electrophysiological action of protocatechuic acid (PCA) on CA1 pyramidal cells ex vivo and network activity in anesthetized female rats using pathway-specific field potential (FP) generators obtained from laminar FPs in cortex and hippocampus. Whole-cell recordings from CA1 pyramidal cells revealed increased synaptic potentials, particularly in response to basal dendritic excitation, while the associated evoked firing was significantly reduced. This counterintuitive result was attributed to a marked increase of the rheobase and voltage threshold, indicating a decreased ability to generate spikes in response to depolarizing current. Systemic administration of PCA only slightly altered the ongoing activity of some FP generators, although it produced a striking disengagement of infraslow activities between the cortex and hippocampus on a scale of minutes. To our knowledge, this is the first report showing the direct action of a dietary polyphenol on electrical activity, performing neuromodulatory roles at both the cellular and network levels.
