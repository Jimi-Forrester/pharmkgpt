25823519|t|Reliability and Validity of the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist in Turkish.
25823519|a|PURPOSE: The aim was to investigate and evaluate validity and reliability of the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC) in Turkey. METHODS: A cross-sectional study design was used. Fifty-nine patients in an intensive care unit for longer than 24 hr were included in this study. RESULTS: Cronbach's alpha coefficient indicated that the ICDSC was a reliable test with high internal consistency (specialist nurse min: 0.720, max: 0.855; primary nurse min: 0.728, max: 0.830). The sensitivity and specificity were high. CONCLUSION: The findings showed that the sensitivity and specificity of the ICDSC are high for Turkish patients. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: The ICDSC provides fast and effective evaluations of the patients for delirium. So, ICDSC may be easily integrated into routine nursing practice.
