35566762|t|The Cognitive Sequelae of Transient Ischemic Attacks-Recent Insights and Future Directions.
35566762|a|There is now considerable evidence that Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) carries important sequelae beyond the risk of recurrent stroke, particularly with respect to peri-event and post-event cognitive dysfunction and subsequent cognitive decline. The occurrence of a TIA could provide an important window in understanding the relationship of early mixed vascular-neurodegenerative cognitive decline, and by virtue of their clinical relevance as a "warning" event, TIAs could also furnish the opportunity to act preventatively not only for stroke prevention but also for dementia prevention. In this review, we discuss the current state of the literature regarding the cognitive sequelae associated with TIA, reviewing important challenges in the field. In particular, we discuss definitional and methodological challenges in the study of TIA-related cognitive impairment, confounding factors in the cognitive evaluation of these patients, and provide an overview of the evidence on both transient and long-term cognitive impairment after TIA. We compile recent insights from clinical studies regarding the predictors and mediators of cognitive decline in these patients and highlight important future directions for work in this area.
