35453377|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by neuronal dysfunction, and decreased memory and cognitive function. Iron is critical for neuronal activity, neurotransmitter biosynthesis, and energy homeostasis. Iron accumulation occurs in AD and results in neuronal dysfunction through activation of multifactorial mechanisms. Mitochondria generate energy and iron is a key co-factor required for: (1) ATP production by the electron transport chain, (2) heme protein biosynthesis and (3) iron-sulfur cluster formation. Disruptions in iron homeostasis result in mitochondrial dysfunction and energetic failure. Ferroptosis, a non-apoptotic iron-dependent form of cell death mediated by uncontrolled accumulation of reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxidation, is associated with AD and other neurodegenerative diseases. AD pathogenesis is complex with multiple diverse interacting players including Abeta-plaque formation, phosphorylated tau, and redox stress. Unfortunately, clinical trials in AD based on targeting these canonical hallmarks have been largely unsuccessful. Here, we review evidence linking iron dysregulation to AD and the potential for targeting ferroptosis as a therapeutic intervention for AD.
