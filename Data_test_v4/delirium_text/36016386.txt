36016386|a|The high-risk human papillomaviruses are oncogenic viruses associated with almost all cases of cervical carcinomas, and increasing numbers of anal, and oral cancers. Two oncogenic HPV proteins, E6 and E7, are capable of immortalizing keratinocytes and are required for HPV associated cell transformation. Currently, the influence of these oncoproteins on the global regulation of the host proteome is not well defined. Liquid chromatography coupled with quantitative tandem mass spectrometry using isobaric-tagged peptides was used to investigate the effects of the HPV16 oncoproteins E6 and E7 on protein levels in human neonatal keratinocytes (HEKn). Pathway and gene ontology enrichment analyses revealed that the cells expressing the HPV oncoproteins have elevated levels of proteins related to interferon response, inflammation and DNA damage response, while the proteins related to cell organization and epithelial development are downregulated. This study identifies dysregulated pathways and potential biomarkers associated with HPV oncoproteins in primary keratinocytes which may have therapeutic implications. Most notably, DNA damage response pathways, DNA replication, and interferon signaling pathways were affected in cells transduced with HPV16 E6 and E7 lentiviruses. Moreover, proteins associated with cell organization and differentiation were significantly downregulated in keratinocytes expressing HPV16 E6 + E7. High-risk HPV E6 and E7 oncoproteins are necessary for the HPV-associated transformation of keratinocytes. However their influence on the global dysregulation of keratinocyte proteome is not well documented. Here shotgun proteomics using TMT-labeling detected over 2500 significantly dysregulated proteins associated with E6 and E7 expression. Networks of proteins related to interferon response, inflammation and DNA damage repair pathways were altered.
