7748278|a|A survey of 100 consecutive admissions for alcohol abuse in 1990 highlights the severity of alcohol dependence in the East End of Glasgow. The survey identifies a specific sub-group of heavy drinkers who consume strong lager, usually in open spaces, referred to locally as 'garden parties'. In the total population, males outnumbered females 3:1 with a mean consumption of 268 and 230 units of alcohol per week, respectively. The severity of alcohol abuse was reflected in their social, physical and central nervous system complications. Two-thirds of the population had a family history of alcohol abuse. Over three-quarters of the population showed self neglect with nearly half the males ascribing their marital breakdown or family neglect directly to their drinking problem. Both sexes showed a high prevalence of history of paraesthesiae, while half the male population had clear signs of peripheral neuropathy on admission. A history of delirium tremens in over 50% of the population with a history of seizures in 21% of males and 35% of females indicates central nervous system involvement. Three sub-groups were identified: history of delirium tremens, history of persecutory ideation and history of serious criminality. All three sub-groups had a shorter length of drinking with higher consumption and increased frequency of 'garden parties' than the group as a whole. This survey reinforces the need for appropriate in-patient detoxification and rehabilitation facilities for patients with severe alcohol dependence, to reduce their impact on other health, social work and criminal justice services.
