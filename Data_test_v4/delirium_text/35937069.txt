35937069|a|Alzheimer's disease and epilepsy are common nervous system diseases in older adults, and their incidence rates tend to increase with age. Patients with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease are more prone to have seizures. In patients older than 65 years, neurodegenerative conditions accounted for ~10% of all late-onset epilepsy cases, most of which are Alzheimer's disease. Epilepsy and seizure can occur in the early and late stages of Alzheimer's disease, leading to functional deterioration and behavioral alterations. Seizures promote amyloid-beta and tau deposits, leading to neurodegenerative processes. Thus, there is a bi-directional association between Alzheimer's disease and epilepsy. Epilepsy is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease and, in turn, Alzheimer's disease is an independent risk factor for developing epilepsy in old age. Many studies have evaluated the shared pathogenesis and clinical relevance of Alzheimer's disease and epilepsy. In this review, we discuss the clinical associations between Alzheimer's disease and epilepsy, including their incidence, clinical features, and electroencephalogram abnormalities. Clinical studies of the two disorders in recent years are summarized, and new antiepileptic drugs used for treating Alzheimer's disease are reviewed.
