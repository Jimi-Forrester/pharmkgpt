15374386|a|Tactile pattern recognition of ten different patterns which were engraved upon 4 x 4 cm plastic plaquettes with one hand and thereafter drawing with the other or the same hand was tested in 21 patients with a mild stage primary degenerative presenile onset dementia of Alzheimer type (DAT) and in 14 patients with a questionable dementia on the background of a chronic cardiovascular disease (CVD) in comparison to 15 healthy subjects of the same age (51 years old, elder controls, (EC)) and 16 younger subjects (22 years old, younger controls, (YC)). Patients made about four times more errors than the EC group. Duration from the begin of touching to the end of drawing was significantly longer in patients than in controls. In a second task the subjects had to recognize four subsequent patterns, then to perform a standard multiplication task and afterwards to draw all four patterns in their correct sequence. Patients made about ten times more errors in pattern recognition and series reproduction than age-matched controls.
