35565690|t|Exploring the Role of Metabolites in Cancer and the Associated Nerve Crosstalk.
35565690|a|Since Otto Warburg's first report on the increased uptake of glucose and lactate release by cancer cells, dysregulated metabolism has been acknowledged as a hallmark of cancer that promotes proliferation and metastasis. Over the last century, studies have shown that cancer metabolism is complex, and by-products of glucose and glutamine catabolism induce a cascade of both pro- and antitumorigenic processes. Some vitamins, which have traditionally been praised for preventing and inhibiting the proliferation of cancer cells, have also been proven to cause cancer progression in a dose-dependent manner. Importantly, recent findings have shown that the nervous system is a key player in tumor growth and metastasis via perineural invasion and tumor innervation. However, the link between cancer-nerve crosstalk and tumor metabolism remains unclear. Here, we discuss the roles of relatively underappreciated metabolites in cancer-nerve crosstalk, including lactate, vitamins, and amino acids, and propose the investigation of nutrients in cancer-nerve crosstalk based on their tumorigenicity and neuroregulatory capabilities. Continued research into the metabolic regulation of cancer-nerve crosstalk will provide a more comprehensive understanding of tumor mechanisms and may lead to the identification of potential targets for future cancer therapies.
