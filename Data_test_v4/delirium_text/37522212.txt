37522212|t|Putting the Brakes on Accelerated Cognitive Decline in Alzheimer's Disease with Epileptic Activity.
37522212|a|Epileptic activity is known to exacerbate Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology and worsen disease course. However, few studies have assessed whether treating epileptic activity with antiseizure drugs (ASDs) can improve patient outcomes. The current study by Hautecloque-Raysz et al. shows that patients with prodromal AD and epilepsy (epAD) fare well with ASD treatment, achieving seizure control in a large majority of cases using low dosage ASDs in monotherapy. Compared to slowly progressing AD patients without epilepsy, treated epAD patients experienced a similarly slow cognitive decline. These results suggest that ASDs that suppress seizures can improve outcomes in AD patients with epileptic activity.
