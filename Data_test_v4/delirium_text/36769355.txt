36769355|t|The Gene Expression of Proteins Involved in Intercellular Signaling and Neurodegeneration in the Substantia Nigra in a Mouse Subchronic Model of Parkinson's Disease.
36769355|a|Given the limited access to clinical material for studying the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD), these studies should be carried out on experimental models. We have recently developed a subchronic model of the progressive development of PD with a gradual transition from the preclinical (asymptomatic) stage to the clinical (symptomatic) one. The aim of this study was to evaluate changes in the expression of a wide range of genes in the substantia nigra (SN), the central link in the regulation of motor function, in mice in our subchronic model of PD. We have found changes in the expression of a number of genes encoding enzymes involved in the synthesis and degradation of dopamine as well as proteins involved in the vesicular cycle, axonal transport, protein degradation in the proteasome system, neuroinflammation, and cell death in the SN of our mouse model of the clinical stage of PD. Similar changes in gene expression were previously demonstrated in patients (postmortem), indicating good reproducibility of PD in our model. Further analysis of the gene expression in the SN of mice has shown that the expression of some genes also changes in the model of the preclinical stage, when dopaminergic neurons have not yet died. Thus, this study opens up broad prospects for further evaluation of the molecular mechanisms of PD pathogenesis and the development of a test system for drug screening.
