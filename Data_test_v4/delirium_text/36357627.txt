36357627|a|The study aims to implement a convolutional neural network framework that uses the 18F-FDG PET modality of brain imaging to detect multiple stages of dementia, including Early Mild Cognitive Impairment (EMCI) and Late Mild Cognitive Impairment (LMCI), and Alzheimer's disease (AD) from Cognitively Normal (CN), and assess the results. 18F-FDG PET imaging modality for brain were procured from Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative's (ADNI) repository. The ResNet50V2 model layers were utilised for feature extraction, with the final convolutional layers fine-tuned for this dataset's multi-classification objectives. Multiple metrics and feature maps were utilized to scrutinize and evaluate the model's statistical and qualitative inference. The multi-classification model achieved an overarching accuracy of 98.44% and Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 95% on the testing set. Feature maps aided in deducing finer aspects of the model's overall operation. This framework helped classifying from the 18F-FDG PET brain images, the subtypes of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) which include EMCI, LMCI, from AD, CN groups and achieved an all-inclusive sensitivity of 94% and specificity of 95% respectively.
