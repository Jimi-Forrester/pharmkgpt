31138986|t|Assessment of Cognitive Phenotyping in Inbred, Genetically Modified Mice, and Transgenic Mouse Models of Alzheimer's Disease.
31138986|a|Genetically modified mouse models are being used predominantly to understand brain functions and diseases. Well-designed and controlled behavioral analyses of genetically modified mice have successfully led to the identification of gene functions, understanding of brain diseases, and development of treatments. Recently, complex and higher cognitive functions have been examined in mice with genetic mutations. Therefore, research strategies for cognitive phenotyping should be sophisticated and evolve to convey the exact meaning of the findings and provide robust translational tools for testing hypotheses and developing treatments. This review addresses issues of experimental design and discusses studies that have examined cognitive function using mouse strain differences, genetically modified mice, and transgenic mice for Alzheimer's disease.
