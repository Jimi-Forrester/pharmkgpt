37341205|a|BACKGROUND: Depression is common among people with dementia. Despite most people with dementia living in the community, there have been few investigations of self-reported depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation among community-dwelling people with dementia in Australia. This study aimed to explore the proportion of people with mild, moderate and severe levels of depressive symptoms, and suicidal ideation among a sample of people living with dementia in Australia. Correlates of reporting depressive symptoms were also explored. METHODS: Adults diagnosed with dementia by a medical professional who were English speaking and community-dwelling were asked to complete a paper and pencil survey. Those who were unable to provide independent consent were excluded. Depression was assessed using the Geriatric Depression Scale -15, and suicidal ideation was assessed using two study-specific items. Multivariable analyses examined quality of life, unmet needs and sociodemographic factors associated with having a score of five or more on the Geriatric Depression Scale-15. RESULTS: Ninety-four people participated in the study. Thirty-seven percent (n = 35) reported some level of depressive symptoms, with most of these (21%, n = 20) classified as having mild depressive symptoms. Five participants (5%) reported they had had thoughts of being better off dead or hurting themselves, while three (3%) reported having had a plan to end their life. For each additional unmet need, the odds of being depressed increased by 25%(P < 0.001). For each point increase in quality of life, the odds of being depressed decreased by 48% (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The high proportion of people with dementia who report depressive symptoms suggests the need to routinely assess depressive symptoms among this group. There may also be benefits in assessing unmet needs and addressing these where possible as part of an approach to reducing depression among people living with dementia in the community.
