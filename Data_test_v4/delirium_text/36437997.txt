36437997|a|Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease inextricably linked to both the innate and acquired immune systems of the body. Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by immune system dysfunction. Although recent studies suggest that a clinical relationship exists between PD and periodontitis, the pathogenesis of this relationship is unclear. Therefore, in the present study, we obtained datasets of periodontitis and PD from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and extracted 785 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), including 15 common upregulated genes and four common downregulated genes. We performed enrichment analyses of these DEGs using Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analyses. We found that the genes were mainly enriched in keratinocyte differentiation, neuronal cell bodies, and structural constituents of epidermis terms, and pathways such as immune response and synaptic pathways. In addition, we screened matching hub genes by constructing a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network map and a Molecular Complex Detection (MCODE) map using the Cytoscape software. The hub genes were then subjected to GO enrichment analysis, which revealed that the dopamine biosynthetic process, dopaminergic synapse and dopamine-binding terms, and dopaminergic synapse and serotonergic synapse pathways were primarily where they were expressed. Finally, we selected four of these genes for validation in the periodontitis and PD datasets, and we confirmed that these hub genes were highly sensitive and specific for diagnosing and monitoring PD and periodontitis. In conclusion, the above experimental results indicate that periodontitis is a high-risk factor for PD, and the association between these two conditions is mainly manifested in immune and dopamine-related pathways. Hub genes, such as the CDSN, TH, DDC, and SLC6A3 genes, may serve as potential biomarkers for diagnosing or detecting PD.
