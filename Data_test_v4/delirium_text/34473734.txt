34473734|a|OBJECTIVE: We aimed to analyze risk factors related to the development of delirium, aiming for early intervention in patients with greater risk. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Observational study, including prospectively collected patients treated in a single general ICU. These were classified into two groups, according to whether they developed delirium or not (screening performed using CAM-ICU tool). Demographics and clinical data were analyzed. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to quantify existing associations. RESULTS: 1462 patients were included. 93 developed delirium (incidence: 6.3%). These were older, scored higher on the Clinical Frailty Scale, on the risk scores on admission (SAPS-3 and SOFA), and had a greater number of organ failures (OF). We observed more incidence of delirium in patients who (a) presented more than two OF (20.4%; OR 4.9; CI95%: 2.9-8.2), and (b) were more than 74 years old albeit having <2 OF (8.6%; OR 2.1; CI95%: 1.3-3.5). Patients who developed delirium had longer ICU and hospital length-of-stays and a higher rate of readmission. CONCLUSIONS: The highest risk observed for developing delirium clustered in patients who presented more than 2 OF and patients over 74 years old. The detection of patients at high risk for developing delirium could imply a change in management and improved quality of care.
