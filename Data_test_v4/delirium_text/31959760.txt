31959760|a|Induction of autophagy can have beneficial effects in several human diseases, e.g. cancer and neurodegenerative diseases (ND). Here, we therefore evaluated the potential of two novel autophagy-inducing compounds, i.e. STF-62247 and pimozide, to stimulate autophagy as well as autophagic cell death (ACD) using mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) as a cellular model. Importantly, both STF-62247 and pimozide triggered several hallmarks of autophagy in MEFs, i.e. enhanced levels of LC3B-II protein, its accumulation at distinct cytosolic sites and increase of the autophagic flux. Intriguingly, autophagy induction by STF-62247 and pimozide resulted in cell death that was significantly reduced in ATG5- or ATG7-deficient MEFs. Consistent with ACD induction, pharmacological inhibitors of apoptosis, necroptosis or ferroptosis failed to protect MEFs from STF-62247- or pimozide-triggered cell death. Interestingly, at subtoxic concentrations, pimozide stimulated fragmentation of the mitochondrial network, degradation of mitochondrial proteins (i.e. mitofusin-2 and cytochrome c oxidase IV (COXIV)) as well as a decrease of the mitochondrial mass, indicative of autophagic degradation of mitochondria by pimozide. In conclusion, this study provides novel insights into the induction of selective autophagy as well as ACD by STF-62247 and pimozide in MEFs.
