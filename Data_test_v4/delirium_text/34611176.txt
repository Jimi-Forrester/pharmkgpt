34611176|t|Preparation and characterization of graphitic carbon nitride-supported L-arginine as a highly efficient and recyclable catalyst for the one-pot synthesis of condensation reactions.
34611176|a|In this work, graphitic carbon nitride-supported L-arginine (g-C3N4@L-arginine) nanocatalyst was synthesized and evaluated using FT-IR, EDX, XRD, TGA, and FESEM analyses. The performance of the prepared nanocatalyst was examined in the synthesis of 1,4-dihydropyridine, 4H-chromene, and 2,3-dihydro quinazoline derivatives. The novel g-C3N4@L-arginine nanocatalyst showed high thermal stability, easy separation from reaction media, the capability to be used in various multicomponent reactions, and acceptable reusability.
