36550859|t|The emerging role of olanzapine in paediatric CINV control: A review.
36550859|a|Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) is a serious side effect of chemotherapy that negatively impacts the quality of life of oncological patients and is associated with the emetogenic risk specific to administered chemotherapy. Current practice guidelines on the use of antiemetics in CINV include the option of adding olanzapine to antiemetic regimens in the management of adult CINV. The use of olanzapine in pediatric CINV has been restricted to children with poor CINV control. Research on the use of olanzapine in pediatric CINV has been limited. The aim of this review was to evaluate current evidence on the effective and safe antiemetic use of olanzapine in pediatric CINV of any type following chemotherapy of any emetogenicity. Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL databases were searched for any literature on the use of olanzapine in pediatric CINV published from 2015 to 2022. Studies that reported on the olanzapine-containing antiemetic regimen in peadiatric CINV control specifically were included. Search restrictions were placed on research published in English. The search generated 43 records that were assessed for eligibility. Out of 10 identified eligible studies a third were RCT. Findings of this review suggest that adding olanzapine to antiemetic regimen in pediatric CINV control is a worthwhile consideration. Further research is needed to establish the efficacy and safety of antiemetic olanzapine use in pediatric CINV.
