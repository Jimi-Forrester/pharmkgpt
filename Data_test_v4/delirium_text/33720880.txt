33720880|a|BACKGROUND: Cerebrovascular dysfunction confers risk for functional decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD), yet the clinical interplay of these two pathogenic processes is not well understood. OBJECTIVE: We utilized Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) data to examine associations between peripherally derived soluble cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) and clinical diagnostic indicators of AD. METHODS: Using generalized linear regression models, we examined cross-sectional relationships of soluble plasma vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and E-Selectin to baseline diagnosis and functional impairment (clinical dementia rating sum-of-boxes, CDR-SB) in the ADNI cohort (n = 112 AD, n = 396 mild cognitive impairment (MCI), n = 58 cognitively normal). We further analyzed associations of these biomarkers with brain-based AD biomarkers in a subset with available cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) data (n = 351). p-values derived from main effects and interaction terms from the linear regressions were used to assess the relationship between independent and dependent variables for significance (significance level was set at 0.05 a priori for all analysis). RESULTS: Higher mean VCAM-1 (p = 0.0026) and ICAM-1 (p = 0.0189) levels were found in AD versus MCI groups; however, not in MCI versus cognitively normal groups. Only VCAM-1 was linked with CDR-SB scores (p = 0.0157), and APOE e4 genotype modified this effect. We observed independent, additive associations when VCAM-1 and CSF amyloid-beta (Abeta42), total tau, phosphorylated tau (P-tau), or P-tau/Abeta42 (all < p = 0.01) were combined in a CDR-SB model; ICAM-1 showed a similar pattern, but to a lesser extent. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate independent associations of plasma-based vascular biomarkers and CSF biomarkers with AD-related clinical impairment.
