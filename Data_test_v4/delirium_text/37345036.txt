The optimization of HDCT regimens can, therefore, essentially contribute to improving the depth and duration of tumor remissions. To date, melphalan at 200 mg/m2 is the standard HDCT regimen for fit MM patients. In our previous work, we showed promising efficacy and safety results for treosulfan (14 g/m2) and melphalan (200 mg/m2) (TreoMel) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients receiving ASCT. Based on these data, TreoMel became the standard of care for fit MM patients at our institution. (2) Methods: We identified 115 consecutive MM patients who underwent consolidation with TreoMel between 01/2020 and 08/2022 at the University Hospital of Bern. We analyzed the safety and efficacy data, as well as the treosulfan pharmacokinetics, correlating them with tumor responses. (3) Results: A complete response (CR) rate of 84% was achieved, which is comparable to the CR rate reported for the quadruplet combination. The median PFS was 30 months (95% CI: 20.4-not reached), and the 31-month OS rate was 83%. The median area under the curve (AUC) for treosulfan was 952.5 mg*h/L (range: 527.4-1781.4), and the median peak level was 332.3 mg/L (range: 168-554). The treosulfan pharmacokinetics showed no significant correlation with MM responses after HDCT and ASCT. However, female patients had a significantly higher AUC (p = 0.007) and peak value (p = 0.001), and the higher values were associated with longer hospitalizations. (4) Conclusions: Treatment consolidation with TreoMel HDCT demonstrated a promising efficacy and safety profile in our cohort of MM patients and deserves further investigation in prospective studies.
