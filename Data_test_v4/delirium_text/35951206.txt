35951206|t|Triiodothyronine Treatment reverses Depression-Like Behavior in a triple-transgenic animal model of Alzheimer's Disease.
35951206|a|Alzheimer disease's (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive and behavioral impairment. The central nervous system is an important target of thyroid hormones (TH). An inverse association between serum triiodothyronine (T3) levels and the risk of AD symptoms and progression has been reported. We investigated the effects of T3 treatment on the depression-like behavior in male transgenic 3xTg-AD mice. Animals were divided into 2 groups treated with daily intraperitoneal injections of 20 ng/g of body weight (b.w.) L-T3 (T3 group) or saline (vehicle, control group). The experimental protocol lasted 21 days, and behavioral tests were conducted on days 18-20. At the end of the experiment, the TH profile and hippocampal gene expression were evaluated. The T3-treated group significantly increased serum T3 and decreased thyroxine (T4) levels. When compared to control hippocampal samples, the T3 group exhibited attenuated glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3), metalloproteinase 10 (ADAM10), amyloid-beta precursor-protein (APP), serotonin transporter (SERT), 5HT1A receptor, monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8) and bone morphogenetic protein 7 (BMP-7) gene expression, whereas augmented superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) and Hairless gene expression. T3-treated animals also displayed reduced immobility time in both the tail suspension and forced swim tests, and in the latter presented a higher latency time compared to the control group. Therefore, our findings suggest that in an AD mouse model, T3 supplementation promotes improvements in depression-like behavior, through the modulation of the serotonergic related genes involved in the transmission mediated by 5HT1A receptors and serotonin reuptake, and attenuated disease progression.
