37858740|t|Infection burden and its association with neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging markers in the UK Biobank.
37858740|a|BACKGROUND: Infection burden (IB), although linked to neurodegeneration, including Alzheimer's Disease (AD), has not been examined against neurite orientation, dispersion, and density imaging (NODDI) measures. METHODS: Among 38,803 UK Biobank adults (Age:40-70 years), we tested associations of total IB (IBtotal, 47.5 %) and hospital-treated IB (IBhosp, 9.7 %) with NODDI measures (5-15 years later), including volume fraction of Gaussian isotropic diffusion (ISOVF), intra-cellular volume fraction (ICVF) and orientation dispersion (OD) indices, using multiple linear regression models. RESULTS: Total and hospital-treated infection burdens (IBtotal and IBhosp) were associated with increased ISOVF, indicating increased free-water component. IBtotal was positively associated with OD, indicating that at higher IBtotal there was greater fanning of neurites. This was more evident in the lower cardiovascular health group. IBhosp was associated with higher OD, and lower ICVF at higher AD polygenic risk. Together, these findings indicate that both total and hospital-treated infections have effects on NODDI outcomes in the direction of poor brain health. These effects were largely homogeneous across cardiovascular health and AD polygenic risk groups, with some effects shown to be stronger at poor cardiovascular health and/or higher AD risk. CONCLUSIONS: Total and hospital-treated infections were associated with poorer white matter microstructure (higher ISOVF or OD or lower ICVF), with some heterogeneity across cardiovascular health and AD risk. Longitudinal studies with multiple repeats on neuroimaging markers in comparable samples are needed.
