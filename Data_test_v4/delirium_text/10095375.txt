10095375|t|[Assessment of dementia].
10095375|a|The evaluation for dementia has to answer three questions: first, if there is indeed a dementia or if there is perhaps a delirium or a mild cognitive impairment. Dementia targeted interviewing of the patients and their relatives have to be followed by neuropsychological evaluations. Dementia screening tests are the mini mental state examination in combination with a clock drawing test. For an early diagnosis, a more comprehensive neuropsychological assessment by specialists is needed. For confirmation of a diagnosis of dementia, a nosological differential diagnosis including a physical, especially neurological and psychological examination, laboratory tests and perhaps an EEG or brain imaging is necessary. At least, a careful evaluation of caregiver burdens is absolutely necessary for medico-social interventions.
