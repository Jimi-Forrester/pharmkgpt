38051674|t|Chemical, Biochemical, Cellular, and Physiological Characterization of Leucettinib-21, a Down Syndrome and Alzheimer's Disease Drug Candidate.
38051674|a|Leucettinibs are substituted 2-aminoimidazolin-4-ones (inspired by the marine sponge natural product Leucettamine B) developed as pharmacological inhibitors of DYRK1A (dual-specificity, tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1A), a therapeutic target for indications such as Down syndrome and Alzheimer's disease. Leucettinib-21 was selected as a drug candidate following extensive structure/activity studies and multiparametric evaluations. We here report its physicochemical properties (X-ray powder diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry, stability, solubility, crystal structure) and drug-like profile. Leucettinib-21's selectivity (analyzed by radiometric, fluorescence, interaction, thermal shift, residence time assays) reveals DYRK1A as the first target but also some "off-targets" which may contribute to the drug's biological effects. Leucettinib-21 was cocrystallized with CLK1 and modeled in the DYRK1A structure. Leucettinib-21 inhibits DYRK1A in cells (demonstrated by direct catalytic activity and phosphorylation levels of Thr286-cyclin D1 or Thr212-Tau). Leucettinib-21 corrects memory disorders in the Down syndrome mouse model Ts65Dn and is now entering safety/tolerance phase 1 clinical trials.
