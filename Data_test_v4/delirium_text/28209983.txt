28209983|t|Generation and quantitative proteomics analysis of CK2alpha/alpha'(-/-) cells.
28209983|a|CK2 is a ubiquitous, constitutively active, highly pleiotropic, acidophilic Ser/Thr protein kinase whose holoenzyme is composed of two catalytic (alpha and/or alpha') subunits and a dimer of a non-catalytic beta subunit. Abnormally high CK2 level/activity is often associated with malignancy and a variety of cancer cells have been shown to rely on it to escape apoptosis. To gain information about the actual "druggability" of CK2 and to dissect CK2 dependent cellular processes that are instrumental to the establishment and progression of neoplasia we have exploited the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology to generate viable clones of C2C12 myoblasts devoid of either both the CK2 catalytic subunits or its regulatory beta-subunit. Suppression of both CK2 catalytic subunits promotes the disappearance of the beta-subunit as well, through its accelerated proteasomal degradation. A quantitative proteomics analysis of CK2alpha/alpha'(-/-) versus wild type cells shows that knocking out both CK2 catalytic subunits causes a rearrangement of the proteomics profile, with substantially altered level ( > 50%) of 240 proteins, 126 of which are up-regulated, while the other are down-regulated. A functional analysis reveals that up- and down-regulated proteins tend to be segregated into distinct sub-cellular compartments and play different biological roles, consistent with a global rewiring underwent by the cell to cope with the lack of CK2.
