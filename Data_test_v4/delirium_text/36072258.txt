36072258|a|The relationship between corpus callosum and schizophrenia is elusive. Neuropsychiatric symptoms in Mild encephalitis with reversible splenial lesion (MERS) such as delirium, and negativism, suggest a link between corpus callosum and psychiatric disturbances. Here in, we report catatonia as an initial symptom of MERS in a schizophrenic patient. The aim of this study is to discuss the likely causal relationship between catatonic syndrome and MERS. To the best of our knowledge, the catatonia was not reported before as a prodromal symptom of MERS. We therefore report this case in order to enlarge the spectrum of MERS symptoms in psychiatric patients and discuss the relationship between catatonia and splenium lesions.
