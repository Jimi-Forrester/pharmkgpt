29482941|t|Design, synthesis, and in vitro evaluation of quinolinyl analogues for alpha-synuclein aggregation.
29482941|a|Here we report the synthesis and in vitro evaluation of 25 new quinolinyl analogues for alpha-synuclein aggregates. Three lead compounds were subsequently labeled with carbon-11 or fluorine-18 to directly assess their potency in a direct radioactive competitive binding assay ng both alpha-synuclein fibrils and tissue homogenates from Alzheimer's disease (AD) cases. The modest binding affinities of these three radioligands toward alpha-synuclein were comparable with results from the Thioflavin T fluorescence assay. However, all three ligand also showed modest binding affinity to the AD homogenates and lack selectivity for alpha-synuclein. The structure-activity relationship data from these 25 analogues will provide useful information for design and synthesis of new compounds for imaging alpha-synuclein aggregation.
