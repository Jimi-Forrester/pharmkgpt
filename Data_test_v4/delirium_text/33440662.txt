33440662|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia worldwide and is characterised pathologically by the accumulation of amyloid beta and tau protein aggregates. Currently, there are no approved disease modifying therapies for clearance of either of these proteins from the brain of people with AD. As well as abnormalities in protein aggregation, other pathological changes are seen in this condition. The function of mitochondria in both the nervous system and rest of the body is altered early in this disease, and both amyloid and tau have detrimental effects on mitochondrial function. In this review article, we describe how the function and structure of mitochondria change in AD. This review summarises current imaging techniques that use surrogate markers of mitochondrial function in both research and clinical practice, but also how mitochondrial functions such as ATP production, calcium homeostasis, mitophagy and reactive oxygen species production are affected in AD mitochondria. The evidence reviewed suggests that the measurement of mitochondrial function may be developed into a future biomarker for early AD. Further work with larger cohorts of patients is needed before mitochondrial functional biomarkers are ready for clinical use.
