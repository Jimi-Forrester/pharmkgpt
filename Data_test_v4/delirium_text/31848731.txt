31848731|a|BACKGROUND: Hypopharyngeal reconstruction after salvage pharyngolaryngectomy results in high postoperative morbidity. The use of salivary bypass tubes can reduce pharyngocutaneous fistula (PCF) formation. The influence of bacterial colonization has not been described in literature. METHODS: Bacterial swipes from 26 consecutive patients reconstructed after laryngopharyngectomy in combination with Montgomery salivary bypass tubes (MSBT) were analyzed in regards to PCF formation. RESULTS: PCF occurred in 2 untreated primary and in 9 salvage laryngopharyngectomies, respectively. Bacterial colonization showed high rates of gram-negative pathogens and drug resistance to standard Ampicillin treatment. Type of bacteria was not associated with fistula formation. Antibiotic resistance was found in 6 out 11 patients (54%) with PCF. CONCLUSIONS: We identified high rates of antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative pathogens on MSBT. Although not statistically significant, PCF were found more frequently in drug-resistant patients. Bacterial colonization of hypopharyngeal reconstructions should therefore be taken into account for perioperative prophylaxis.
