31901649|t|Incidence, risk factors, and outcomes for sepsis-associated delirium in patients with mechanical ventilation: A sub-analysis of a multicenter randomized controlled trial.
31901649|a|PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate incidence, risk factors, and outcomes for sepsis-associated delirium (SAD) in mechanically ventilated patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective post-hoc analysis of the DExmedetomidine for Sepsis in Intensive care unit Randomized Evaluation (DESIRE) trial. Outcomes included 28-day mortality, ventilator-free days, length of ICU stay, self-extubation, and re-intubation. Multivariable analysis was performed to identify variables independently associated with SAD. RESULTS: We retrospectively divided the patients into two groups: delirium group (n = 89) and non-delirium group (n = 98). There were no significant differences between the groups in 28-day mortality, self-extubation, and re-intubation. The number of ventilator-free days was significantly less in the delirium vs. non-delirium group (17 vs. 22 days, p = .006), and the length of ICU stay was significantly longer in the delirium group (10 vs. 5 days, p = .04). Multivariable analyses revealed that emergency surgery, more doses of midazolam, and fentanyl were independent predictors for SAD. CONCLUSIONS: SAD was associated with a less number of ventilator-free days and longer length of ICU stay. Emergency surgery, more doses of midazolam, and fentanyl may be independent risk factors for SAD in mechanically ventilated patients with sepsis.
