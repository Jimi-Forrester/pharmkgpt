38374040|a|BACKGROUND: Patients with cervical spondylosis myelopathy (CSM) may experience severe neurological dysfunction due to untimely spinal cord compression after surgery. These disorders may lead to sensory and motion disorders, causing considerable psychological distress. Recent studies found that virtual reality (VR) technology can be an effective tool for treating spinal cord injuries. Owing to this discovery, we developed an exploratory research project to investigate the impact of this intervention on the postoperative recovery of patients with CSM. METHODS: The purpose of this randomized controlled trial was to evaluate the efficacy of combining VR technology with conventional rehabilitation strategies for the postoperative rehabilitation of patients with CSM. A total of 78 patients will be recruited and randomized to either the conventional rehabilitation group or the group subjected to VR technology combined with conventional rehabilitation strategies. The Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) scale will be the main tool used, and secondary outcomes will be measured via the visual analogue scale (VAS), neck disability index (NDI), and functional MRI (fMRI). The data analysis will identify differences between the intervention and control groups as well as any relationship between the intragroup changes in the functional area of the brain and the subjective scale scores after the intervention. DISCUSSION: The aim of this trial is to investigate the effect of VR training on the postoperative rehabilitation of patients with CSM after 12 intervention treatments. Positive and negative outcomes will help us better understand the effectiveness of the intervention and its neural impact. If effective, this study could provide new options for the postoperative rehabilitation of patients with CSM. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR2300071544).
