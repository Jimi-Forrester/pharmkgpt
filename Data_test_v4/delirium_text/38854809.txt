38854809|a|Dementia is one of the most significant global challenges in medical and social care in the 21st century. It affects not only the patients themselves, but also their families, caregivers, and society in general, causing physical, psychological, and socioeconomic effects. As of 2020, there are approximately 6 million people in Japan aged 65 or older with dementia, and this number is expected to increase to around 7 million by 2025, meaning that one out of every five elderly people will have dementia. To prevent the onset and progression of dementia, it is crucial to have a proper understanding of its risks and adopt a healthy lifestyle. Leading an active life from an early stage can also aid in delaying or preventing the onset of dementia. Livingston has identified 12 risks that can lead to dementia, including physical inactivity, smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, air pollution, head injury, social isolation, poor educational history, obesity, hypertension, diabetes, depression, and hearing loss. Modifying one's lifestyle and leading an active life can be crucial in reducing these risks. The Mediterranean diet is gaining attention as a good practice for dementia prevention due to its diversity, richness in omega-3 fatty acids and vitamins. Exercise has been shown to prevent dementia on biological, behavioral, and socio-psychological levels. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation is a non-invasive brain stimulation method that can alter brain plasticity and is being studied for clinical applications as a non-drug therapy for preventing dementia progression.
