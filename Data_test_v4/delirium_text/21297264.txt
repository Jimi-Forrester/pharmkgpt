21297264|t|PSEN1 and PRNP gene mutations: co-occurrence makes onset very early in a family with FTD phenotype.
21297264|a|Prion protein (PRNP) gene mutations have recently been associated with clinical pictures resembling Frontotemporal dementia (FTD). We describe a novel seven extra-repeat insertional mutation in the PRNP gene in a family affected by early-onset autosomal dominant FTD previously reported as caused by a PSEN1 mutation in which there was inconsistency between clinical picture and genotype. Both mutations were pathogenic and showed a variable penetrance when present separately; when occurring together, the onset was very early, within the third decade of life. Genetic screening of the PRNP gene becomes of major importance in early onset autosomal dominant dementia.
