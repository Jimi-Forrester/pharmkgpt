24940975|t|Alzheimer's disease and the aluminium connection: A literature review.
24940975|a|This review explores the different areas of research that, over the past 35 years, have provided grounds for linking Alzheimer's disease and aluminium. However, in spite of the growing evidence, exposure to aluminium as a risk factor is yet to be confirmed. The evidence is discussed under four headings: evidence from brain aluminium studies; evidence from aluminium uptake studies; evidence from aluminium-related neurodegenerative conditions; and evidence from chronic aluminium exposure studies: aluminium in drinking water, and by occupational exposure.
