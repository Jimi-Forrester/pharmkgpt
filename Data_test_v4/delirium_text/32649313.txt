32649313|t|Super elderly patients with intertrochanteric fractures do not predict worse outcomes and higher mortality than elderly patients: a propensity score matched analysis.
32649313|a|We aimed to investigate whether super elderly patients aged over 90 years had significantly worse functional outcomes, perioperative complications, and survival rates. Among 3560 patients aged over 65 years presenting with intertrochanteric fractures and treated surgically between Jan 2014 and Jan 2019, 2242 patients were included, including 206 in super elderly group and 2036 in elderly group. After using propensity score matching to minimize the effects of possible confounding variables, 192 remained in each group. No significant difference was observed in functional outcomes, perioperative complications, or 30-day, 90-day, and 1-year mortality after propensity score matching and McNemar's tests (p>0.05). After an average follow-up of 37 months, the Kaplan-Meier survival curve showed no significant difference between the two groups in terms of cumulative survival rate (p=0.081, log-rank). Our data demonstrated progressive increases in mortality and poor outcomes with increasing Elixhauser comorbidity scores, which represented the severity index of patients preoperatively. Our study also found that there were weak correlations between five characteristics and the patient age. These results all suggested that it is not the advanced age itself but other concomitant factors, that appear to be responsible for the adverse functional outcomes, perioperative complications, and mortality in super elderly patients.
