38045363|a|Current amyloid beta-targeting approaches for Alzheimer's disease (AD) therapeutics only slow cognitive decline for small numbers of patients. This limited efficacy exists because AD is a multifactorial disease whose pathological mechanism(s) and diagnostic biomarkers are largely unknown. Here we report a new mechanism of AD pathogenesis in which the histone methyltransferase G9a noncanonically regulates translation of a hippocampal proteome that defines the proteopathic nature of AD. Accordingly, we developed a novel brain-penetrant inhibitor of G9a, MS1262, across the blood-brain barrier to block this G9a-regulated, proteopathologic mechanism. Intermittent MS1262 treatment of multiple AD mouse models consistently restored both cognitive and noncognitive functions to healthy levels. Comparison of proteomic/phosphoproteomic analyses of MS1262-treated AD mice with human AD patient data identified multiple pathological brain pathways that elaborate amyloid beta and neurofibrillary tangles as well as blood coagulation, from which biomarkers of early stage of AD including SMOC1 were found to be affected by MS1262 treatment. Notably, these results indicated that MS1262 treatment may reduce or avoid the risk of blood clot burst for brain bleeding or a stroke. This mouse-to-human conservation of G9a-translated AD proteopathology suggests that the global, multifaceted effects of MS1262 in mice could extend to relieve all symptoms of AD patients with minimum side effect. In addition, our mechanistically derived biomarkers can be used for stage-specific AD diagnosis and companion diagnosis of individualized drug effects.
