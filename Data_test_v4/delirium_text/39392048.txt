39392048|t|SPOCK: Master regulator of malignant tumors (Review).
39392048|a|SPARC/osteonectin, CWCV and Kazal-like domain proteoglycan (SPOCK) is a family of highly conserved multidomain proteins. In total, three such family members, SPOCK1, SPOCK2 and SPOCK3, constitute the majority of extracellular matrix glycoproteins. The SPOCK gene family has been demonstrated to serve key roles in tumor regulation by affecting MMPs, which accelerates the progression of cancer epithelial-mesenchymal transition. In addition, they can regulate the cell cycle via overexpression, inhibit tumor cell proliferation by inactivating PI3K/AKT signaling and have been associated with numerous microRNAs that influence the expression of downstream genes. Therefore, the SPOCK gene family are potential cancer-regulating genes. The present review summarizes the molecular structure, tissue distribution and biological function of the SPOCK family of proteins, in addition to its association with cancer. Furthermore, the present review documents the progress made in investigations into the role of SPOCK, whilst also discussing prospects for the future of SPOCK-targeted therapy, to provide novel ideas for clinical application and treatment.
