34084978|a|Stroke stands as one of the most common causes of death among adults worldwide. Currently, tissue plasminogen activator serves as the only approved drug by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke. Stem cell therapy serves as a viable treatment option and has been deemed as a safe and effective treatment for stroke patients. Adult human bone marrow-derived NCS-01 cells serve as a potential treatment for stroke given their ability to reduce stroke-induced pathological deficits by increasing cell viability and mitochondrial activity. Recently, we demonstrated the use of adult bone marrow-derived NCS-01 cells both on both in vitro and in vivo models. Using NCS-01 cells in rat stroke models subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion, an effective dosage of 7.5 x 106 cells/ml, administered through the intracarotid artery within 3 days poststroke, was shown to display significant improvements in motor and neurological behaviors, reductions in infarct area, and peri-infarct cell loss. NCS-01 cells, in comparison with other lines of stem cells (Li cells), are shown to produce greater therapeutic effects, most likely due to the observed filopodia formation that allows the stem cells to extend and target the ischemic cells. Given these findings, NCS-01 stem cells serve as a potential treatment for stroke through the demonstration of profound efficacy and further research that favors their filopodia-mediated mechanism of action.
