29053948|t|Nanoscale Imaging Reveals Big Role for Iron in Alzheimer's Disease.
29053948|a|In this issue of Cell Chemical Biology, Telling et al. (2017) apply advanced X-ray microscopy techniques to reveal magnetite iron species in plaques from a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. The characterization of abnormal iron chemistry in the disease model highlights the potential for iron to combine with the beta-amyloid peptide and accelerate the disease process.
