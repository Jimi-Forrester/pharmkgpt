34087873|a|ABSTRACT: Delirium is a common postoperative complication of patients with hip fracture, yet the risk factors for postoperative delirium in patients with hip fracture remain unclear. We aimed to evaluate the associated risk factors of postoperative delirium in patients with hip fracture, to provide evidence for formulating coping measures of postoperative delirium prevention and treatment in clinical practice.Patients undergoing surgery for hip fracture from March 1, 2018 to September 30, 2020 in our hospital were included. The related characteristics and related lab examination results were reviewed and collected. The univariate and logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the potential risk factors.A total of 462 patients were included, the incidence of postoperative delirium in patients with hip fracture was 16.02%. Logistic regression analyses indicated that history of delirium (OR = 4.38, 1.15-9.53), diabetes mellitus (OR = 5.31, 1.23-10.75), hypoalbuminemia (OR = 4.97, 1.37-9.86), postoperative hypoxemia (OR = 5.67, 2.24-13.42), and body mass index (BMI) (kg/m2) (OR = 3.03, 1.36-6.18) were the independent risk factors for the delirium in patients with hip fracture surgery (all P < 0.05). The cutoff value of postoperative blood sugar, albumin, and BMI for delirium prediction was 8.05 (mmol/L), 32.26 (g/L), and 19.35 (kg/m2), respectively, and the area under curve of postoperative blood sugar, albumin, and BMI was 0.792, 0.714, and 0.703, respectively.Those patients with a history of delirium, postoperative hypoxemia, blood glucose >=8.05 mmol/L, albumin <=32.26 g/L, and BMI <=19.35 kg/m2 particularly need the attention of healthcare providers for the prevention of delirium.
