34932283|a|OBJECTIVE: To determine the types, frequency and key symptoms of severe lesions of the central nervous system (SLCNS) that occurred in patients with hematological malignancies (HM). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The authors conducted a retrospective exploratory study by analyzing the data of 3.620 patients with HM during the period from 01.01.18 to 31.12.19. Thirty-four patients (14 men and 20 women, median age 39 years), who developed SLCNS during treatment, were selected. For comparison with the main group of patients and exclusion of predictors associated with the development of SLCNS, a comparison group was added (by Kernel matching method). A comparison group consisted of 137 patients (59 men and 78 women, median age - 36 years) and was similar to the main group by clinical and laboratory characteristics. A neurological complication was marked as SLCNS if it was an indication for transfer to the intensive care unit (ICU). Statistical analysis included multivariate analysis - multiple binary logistic regression with stepwise inclusion of variables (that were found in the preliminary contingency table analysis) in the model, with control false results (by the false discovery rate method) and estimating the odds ratio, OR (95% CI). RESULTS: SLCNS in patients with HM developed in 0.94% of cases. The main SLCNS in patients with HM were: epileptic seizure (50.0%, n=17), ischemic stroke (20.6%, n=7), hemorrhagic stroke (17.6%, n=6) and meningoencephalitis (11.8%, n=4). The following independent significant (Wald test p<=0.05) predictors associated with the development of SLCNS in patients with HM during inpatient treatment were identified: antibiotic therapy (when more than 5 drugs are prescribed), OR=2.9 (1.2-7, four); polychemotherapy (if more than 4 drugs are prescribed), OR=2.9 (1.1-7.8); thrombocytopenia (with a platelet count less than 50 109 g/l), OR=2.3 (1.0-5.2) and delirium, OR=3.7 (1.3-10.8), and also the presence of neurological disorders in the patient's history, OR=2.6 (1.1-6.3). CONCLUSION: The main types of SLCNS in patients with HM were: epileptic seizure, ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes, and meningoencephalitis. Four predictors associated with the development of SLCNS in the course of HM treatment were identified: massive antibacterial (with more than 5 drugs) and chemotherapeutic (with more than 4 drugs) effects, thrombocytopenia and manifestation of delirium, as well as one risk factor: a history of neurological disorder. These factors need to be considered and monitored during treatment, because each of them increases the risk of developing SLCNS.
