33025403|t|Chronic endometritis and altered embryo implantation: a unified pathophysiological theory from a literature systematic review.
33025403|a|PURPOSE: Chronic endometritis (CE) is a frequent hysteroscopic and histological finding which affects embryo transfer implantation during IVF-ICSI cycles. In particular, CE impairs proper decidualization and, subsequently, implantation. Although this correlation has been clearly clarified, a pathophysiological explanation assembling all the studies performed has not been elucidated yet. For this reason, we have structured a systematic review considering all the original articles that evaluated a pathological element involved in CE and implantation impairment. METHODS: The authors searched electronic databases and, after screening, collected 15 original articles. These were fully scanned and used to create a summary pathway. RESULTS: CE is primarily caused by infections, which lead to a specific cytokine and leukocyte pattern in order to prepare the uterus to fight the noxa. In particular, the immunosuppression requested for a proper semi-allogenic embryo transfer implantation is converted into an immunoreaction, which hampers correct embryo implantation. Moreover, endometrial vascularization is affected and both irregular vessel density and luminal thickening and thrombosis reduce what we have first identified as endometrial flow reserve. Finally, incorrect uterine wave propagation could affect embryo contact with decidua. CONCLUSION: This is the first summary of evidence on CE pathophysiology and its relationship with infertility. Understanding the CE pathophysiology could improve our knowledge in embryo transfer success.
