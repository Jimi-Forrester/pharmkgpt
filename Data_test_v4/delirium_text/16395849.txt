16395849|a|BACKGROUND: Cronkhite-Canada syndrome is a very rare illness and psychical disturbances developed as a consequence of this illness are very rarely described. That is the case because majority of the symptoms of this syndrome are associated with the polyposis of the gastrointestinal tract. AIM: The aim of this case report is to link the development of acute brain syndrome with this rare syndrome. PATIENT: The patient was two times treated under the diagnosis of Cronkhite-Canada syndrome in the clinics of internal medicine in Rijeka and Zagreb, and then in the Psychiatric Clinic in Rijeka under the diagnosis of acute brain syndrome (F05.0). RESULT: Therapy with a typical antipsychotic (haloperidol) and corresponding internistic treatment gave results very fast and calmed acute delirium. CONCLUSION: Typical antipsychotics are efficient in the treatment of the acute brain syndrome caused by Cronkhite-Canada syndrome. Acute brain syndrome is caused solely by the lack of electrolytes and other important nutrients because of a malabsorption syndrome, conditioned by a diffuse polyposis of intestines.
