27940456|a|There is significant evidence that many older surgical patients experience at least a transient decrease in cognitive function. Although there is still equipoise regarding the degree, duration, and mechanism of cognitive dysfunction, there is a concurrent need to provide best-practice clinical evidence. The two major cognitive disorders seen after surgery are postoperative delirium and postoperative cognitive dysfunction. Delirium is a public health problem; millions of dollars are spent annually on delirium-related medical resource use and prolonged hospital stays. Postoperative cognitive dysfunction is a research construct that historically signifies decline in performance on a neuropsychiatric test or group of tests and begins days to weeks after surgery. This review focuses on the current state of information gathered by several interdisciplinary stakeholder groups. Although there is still a need for high-level evidence to guide clinical practice, there is an emerging literature that can guide practitioners.
