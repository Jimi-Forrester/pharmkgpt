24558640|t|Poor Sleep as a Precursor to Cognitive Decline in Down Syndrome : A Hypothesis.
24558640|a|We propose that sleep disruption is a lever arm that influences how cognition emerges in development and then declines in response to Alzheimer disease in people with Down syndrome. Addressing sleep disruptions might be an overlooked way to improve cognitive outcomes in this population. This article is a contribution to a Special Issue on Down Syndrome curated by the editors of the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease & Parkinsonism.
