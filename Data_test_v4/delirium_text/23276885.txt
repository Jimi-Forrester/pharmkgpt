23276885|a|Epidemiological studies have proposed that depression may increase the risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD), even in patients with early-onset depression. Although metabolism of amyloid beta protein (Abeta) in elderly depression received attention in terms of their correlation, there is a serious heterogeneity in elderly depression in terms of age at onset of depression. Moreover, it is unknown whether early-onset major depressive disorder (MDD) has a long-term effect on the involvement of Abeta metabolism and later development of AD. Thus, we evaluated serum Abeta40 and Abeta42 levels, the Abeta40/Abeta42 ratio in 89 elderly (>=60 years of age) inpatients with MDD and 81 age-matched healthy controls, and compared them among patients with early-onset (<60 years) and late-onset (>=60years) MDD and controls. The results showed that the serum Abeta40/Abeta42 ratio was significantly higher in patients with both early- and late-onset MDD than in controls (early-onset, p=0.010; late-onset, p=0.043), and it is of great interest that the serum Abeta40/Abeta42 ratio was negatively correlated with the age at MDD onset (R=-0.201, p=0.032). These results suggest that an earlier onset of MDD may have a more serious abnormality in Abeta metabolism, possibly explaining a biological mechanism underlying the link between depression and AD.
