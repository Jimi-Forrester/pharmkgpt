31594230|t|Cross-Sectional Association Between Cognitive Frailty and White Matter Hyperintensity Among Memory Clinic Patients.
31594230|a|BACKGROUND: Cognitive frailty (CF) is defined as simultaneous presence of physical frailty (PF) and cognitive impairment among older adults without dementia. Although white matter hyperintensities (WMH) as expressions of cerebral small vessel disease are associated with physical and cognitive decline and could manifest as CF, this association remains yet to be clarified. OBJECTS: To clarify the association between CF and WMH among memory clinic patients. METHODS: The subjects of this cross-sectional study were 121 cognitively normal (CN) and 212 mildly cognitively impaired (MCI) patients who presented to the Memory Clinic at the National Center for Geriatrics and Gerontology of Japan. PF status was defined based on the definition proposed by Fried and colleagues. CF was defined as simultaneous presence of pre-PF or PF and MCI. WMH volumes were measured using an automatic segmentation application. Multiple liner regression analyses with adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors were performed. RESULTS: Of all subjects, 77 (63.6%) and 22 (18.2%) CN patients and 132 (62.3%) and 65 (30.7%) MCI patients were categorized into pre-PF and PF, respectively. Multiple liner regression analysis showed that those with CF had higher WMH volumes than those without (beta= 0.23). When categorized into six groups according to PF and cognitive status, the PF/CN (beta= 0.15), pre-PF/MCI (beta= 0.41), and PF/MCI (beta= 0.34) groups had higher WMH volumes than the non-PF/CN group. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed increased WMH volumes in CF and PF, indicating that WMH could be one of the key underlying brain pathologies of CF.
