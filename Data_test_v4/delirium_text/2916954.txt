2916954|t|A comparison of dementia in Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis.
2916954|a|We compared results of comprehensive neuropsychological testing in 42 patients with clinically diagnosed Alzheimer's disease (AD) and in an equal number of patients with clinically definite chronic-progressive multiple sclerosis. Age, sex, and education were controlled using demographically corrected T scores based on a large normal sample. Both groups showed significant impairment on the test battery, but the degree of dementia was more severe in the patients with AD. A deviation score analysis, controlling for overall level of cognitive impairment, revealed significant differences between the groups. Alzheimer's disease was associated with relatively greater impairment of learning, memory, and verbal skills, whereas the MS group showed greater relative impairment of attention, incidental memory, and psychomotor functions. These data suggest that both the degree and pattern of mental impairement differ in patients with AD and patients with multiple sclerosis. Our results support a distinction between "gray matter" and "white matter" dementia, and may help clarify the issue of "cortical" vs "subcortical" dementia by demonstrating neuropsychological differences based on secure neuropathologic distinctions.
