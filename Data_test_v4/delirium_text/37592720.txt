37592720|t|Impact of Dementia on Incidence and Severity of Postoperative Pulmonary Complications Following Hip Fracture Surgery Among Older Patients.
37592720|a|Postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) are the leading cause of death following hip fracture surgery. Dementia has been identified as a PPC risk factor that complicates the clinical course. By leveraging electronic health records, this retrospective observational study evaluated the impact of dementia on the incidence and severity of PPCs, hospital length of stay, and postoperative 30-day mortality among 875 older patients (>=65 years) who underwent hip fracture surgery between October 1, 2015 and December 31, 2018 at a health system in the southeastern United States. Inverse probability of treatment weighting using propensity scores was utilized to balance confounders between patients with and without dementia to isolate the impact of dementia on PPCs. Regression analyses revealed that dementia did not have a statistically significant impact on the incidence and severity of PPCs or postoperative 30-day mortality. However, dementia significantly extended the hospital length of stay by an average of 1.37 days.
