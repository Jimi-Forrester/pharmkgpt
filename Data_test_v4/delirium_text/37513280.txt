37513280|t|Chemical and Biological Aspects of Different Species of the Genus Clinanthus Herb. (Amaryllidaceae) from South America.
37513280|a|The genus Clinanthus Herb. is found in the Andes Region (South America), mainly in Peru, Ecuador, and Bolivia. These plants belong to the Amaryllidaceae family, specifically the Amaryllidoideae subfamily, which presents an exclusive group of alkaloids known as Amaryllidaceae alkaloids that show important structural diversity and pharmacological properties. It is possible to find some publications in the literature regarding the botanical aspects of Clinanthus species, although there is little information available about their chemical and biological activities. The aim of this work was to obtain the alkaloid profile and the anti-cholinesterase activity of four different samples of Clinanthus collected in South America: Clinanthus sp., Clinanthus incarnatus, and Clinanthus variegatus. The alkaloid extract of each sample was analyzed by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and their potential against the enzymes acetyl- and butyrylcholinesterase were evaluated. Thirteen alkaloids have been identified among these species, while six unidentified structures have also been detected in these plants. The alkaloid extract of the C. variegatus samples showed the highest structural diversity as well as the best activity against AChE, which was likely due to the presence of the alkaloid sanguinine. The results suggest this genus as a possible interesting new source of Amaryllidaceae alkaloids, which could contribute to the development of new medicines.
