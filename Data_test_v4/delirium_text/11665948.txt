11665948|a|Clinical trials and independent reviews support the use of cholinesterase inhibitors for treating the symptoms of patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD). Before initiating cholinesterase inhibitor therapy, patients should be thoroughly assessed, and the diagnosis confirmed, preferably by a specialist. Compliance with cholinesterase inhibitor therapy should be monitored and the response (in global, cognitive, functional and behavioural domains) reassessed after 2-3 months of treatment. Vitamin E may be protective against AD, and therapy with 1000 IU twice daily may be considered. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of other antioxidant agents, anti-inflammatory agents, monoamine oxidase B inhibitors, folate/homocysteine or antihypertensive drugs in patients with AD, or hormone replacement therapy in affected women.
