36769836|a|Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a common complication in patients with advanced liver disease. It is a brain dysfunction characterized by neurological and psychiatric symptoms that significantly affects quality of life, morbidity and mortality of patients. HE has various precipitants that can potentially promote its onset, alone or in combination. Among the historically well-known precipitants, such as infections, gastrointestinal bleeding, dehydration, electrolyte disorders and constipation, recent studies have highlighted the role of malnutrition and portosystemic shunts as new precipitating factors of HE. The identification, management and correction of these factors are fundamental for effective HE treatment, in addition to pharmacological therapy with non-absorbable disaccharides and/or antibiotics.
