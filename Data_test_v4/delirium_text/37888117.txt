37888117|t|Biochemical Changes in Cardiopulmonary Bypass in Cardiac Surgery: New Insights.
37888117|a|Patients undergoing coronary revascularization with extracorporeal circulation or cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) may develop several biochemical changes in the microcirculation that lead to a systemic inflammatory response. Surgical incision, post-CPB reperfusion injury and blood contact with non-endothelial membranes can activate inflammatory signaling pathways that lead to the production and activation of inflammatory cells, with cytokine production and oxidative stress. This inflammatory storm can cause damage to vital organs, especially the heart, and thus lead to complications in the postoperative period. In addition to the organic pathophysiology during and after the period of exposure to extracorporeal circulation, this review addresses new perspectives for intraoperative treatment and management that may lead to a reduction in this inflammatory storm and thereby improve the prognosis and possibly reduce the mortality of these patients.
