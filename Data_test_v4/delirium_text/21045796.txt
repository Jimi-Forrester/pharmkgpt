21045796|a|Neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, frontotemporal dementia, Huntington disease and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) are characterized by progressive accumulation of protein aggregates in selected brain regions. Protein misfolding and templated assembly into aggregates might result from an imbalance between protein synthesis, aggregation and clearance. Although protein misfolding and aggregation occur in most neurodegenerative disorders, the concept of spreading and infectivity of aggregates in the CNS has, until now, been confined to prion diseases such as CJD and bovine spongiform encephalopathy. Emerging evidence, however, suggests that prion-like spreading, involving secreted proteins such as amyloid-beta and cytosolic proteins such as tau, huntingtin and alpha-synuclein, can occur in other neurodegenerative disorders. The underlying molecular mechanisms and the therapeutic implications of the new data are discussed in this article.
