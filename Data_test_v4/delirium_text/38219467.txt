38219467|a|The occurrence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is strongly associated with the progressive aggregation of a 42-amino-acid fragment derived from the amyloid-beta precursor protein (Abeta1-42). Therefore, it is crucial to establish a versatile platform that can effectively detect Abeta1-42 to aid in the early-stage preclinical diagnosis of AD. Herein, we introduce a specialized split-type analytical platform that enables sensitive and accurate monitoring of Abeta1-42 based on a self-corrected photoelectrochemical (PEC) sensing system. To realize this design, gelatinized Ti3C2@Bi2WO6 Schottky heterojunctions were prepared and served as photoelectrodes for tackling the photoinduced charge carriers. Functionalized CaCO3@CuO2 nanocomposites were used as signal converters to detect Abeta1-42 and amplify the signal further. Benefiting from the glucose oxidation induced acid microenvironment and H2O2 output, the nanocomposites are able to rapidly decompose, producing Ca2+ and Fenton-like catalyst Cu2+. The Cu2+-driven Fenton-like reaction generated  OH, which accelerated the 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) oxidation. Additionally, Ca2+ was cross-linked with alginate inducing gelation on the surface of Ti3C2@Bi2WO6 Schottky heterojunctions, influencing mass transfer and light absorption. Eventually results in the shift of photocurrent, allowing for precise quantification with a detection limit of 0.06 pg mL-1. The combination of colorimetric variation and the photoelectric effect provide a more accurate and reliable result. This research opens up new possibilities for constructing PEC platforms and beyond.
