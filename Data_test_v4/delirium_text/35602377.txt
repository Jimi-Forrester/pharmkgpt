35602377|t|Management of Psychiatric Disorders in Patients with Parkinson's Diseases.
35602377|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is a heterogeneous progressive neurodegenerative disorder, with a triad of motor symptoms with akinesia/bradykinesia, resting tremor (4-6 Hz), and rigidity. It is the second most common neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer's disease. The overall management of PD depends on the status of symptoms, functioning of the patients, impairment, disability, and its impact on quality of life. Depression, anxiety disorders, apathy, anhedonia, psychosis, cognitive impairments, dementia, and impulse control disorders (ICDs) are the common psychiatric symptoms/disorders comorbid with PD. Depression remains the most common psychiatric disorder reported to be comorbid with PD. Several pharmacological and nonpharmacological management strategies are used for the treatment of comorbid psychiatric disorders in PD. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors are used to treat depression in patients with PD. The best evidence of efficacy in PD psychosis is for clozapine and pimavanserin. The treatment for cognitive impairments in PD remains poorly researched. Rivastigmine is the only approved treatment for PD as per the Food and Drug Administration. Pramipexole, a dopamine agonist (DA), is reported to cause improvement in the symptoms of decreased willingness in apathy. The treatment approaches for different sleep disorders in PD are different. Identifying the cause, reviewing the patient's ongoing medications, and evaluating the impact of comorbid medical conditions and sleep hygiene are common to all conditions related to sleep disorders. The first approach for treating ICD symptoms is the reduction or discontinuation of DAs. The psychiatric symptoms in patients with PD are highly prevalent, and their management should be included in the basic treatment algorithm for PD. This paper summarizes common psychiatric symptoms/disorders in PD and their management approaches.
