27344279|t|Long-Term Effects of Postoperative Delirium in Patients Undergoing Cardiac Operation: A Systematic Review.
27344279|a|Delirium is an acute syndrome that involves fluctuating changes in attention and cognition. Although delirium is the most common neurologic complication after cardiac operation, data about its impact on long-term outcomes are lacking. The purpose of this systematic review was to examine the effect of postoperative delirium (PoD) on long-term outcomes, including morbidity, probability of death, cognitive decline, institutionalization, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients undergoing cardiac operation. After performing this systematic review we determined that PoD after cardiac operation is associated with an increased risk of probability of death and readmission to the hospital and a decrease in cognitive function, overall function, and HRQoL.
