Machine learning and multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) for the diagnosis of brain disorders are explicitly attracting attention in the neuroimaging community. In this paper, we propose a voxel-wise discriminative framework applied to multi-measure resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) that integrates hybrid MVPA and extreme learning machine (ELM) for the automated discrimination of AD and MCI from the cognitive normal (CN) state. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used two rs-fMRI cohorts: the public Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative database (ADNI2) and an in-house Alzheimer's disease cohort from South Korea, both including individuals with AD, MCI, and normal controls. After extracting three-dimensional (3-D) patterns measuring regional coherence and functional connectivity during the resting state, we performed univariate statistical t-tests to generate a 3-D mask that retained only voxels showing significant changes. Given the initial univariate features, to enhance discriminative patterns, we implemented MVPA feature reduction using support vector machine-recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE), and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), in combination with the univariate t-test. Classifications were performed by an ELM, and its efficiency was compared to linear and nonlinear (radial basis function) SVMs. RESULTS: The maximal accuracies achieved by the method in the ADNI2 cohort were 98.86% (p<0.001) and 98.57% (p<0.001) for AD and MCI vs. CN, respectively. In the in-house cohort, the same accuracies were 98.70% (p<0.001) and 94.16% (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: From a clinical perspective, combining extreme learning machine and hybrid MVPA applied on concatenations of multiple rs-fMRI biomarkers can potentially assist the clinicians in AD and MCI diagnosis.
