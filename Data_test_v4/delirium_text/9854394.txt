9854394|a|Treatments in Alzheimer's disease include treatment of cognitive impairment and behavioral manifestations (agitation, depression, anxiety, delusions). It should be noted that many non cognitive behaviors may have some relations to underlying cognitive impairment. In the not too distant future, physicians can expect to see a variety of medications and controversies over the benefits of slowing symptoms with cholinergic therapeutics approved for clinical use and (or) preventing progression of Alzheimer's disease assessed in clinical trials will emerge.
