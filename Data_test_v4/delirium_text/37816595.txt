37816595|t|Axonal Transport of Lysosomes Is Unaffected in Glucocerebrosidase-Inhibited iPSC-Derived Forebrain Neurons.
37816595|a|Lysosomes are acidic organelles that traffic throughout neurons delivering catabolic enzymes to distal regions of the cell and maintaining degradative demands. Loss of function mutations in the gene GBA encoding the lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GCase) cause the lysosomal storage disorder Gaucher's disease (GD) and are the most common genetic risk factor for synucleinopathies like Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). GCase degrades the membrane lipid glucosylceramide (GlcCer) and mutations in GBA, or inhibiting its activity, results in the accumulation of GlcCer and disturbs the composition of the lysosomal membrane. The lysosomal membrane serves as the platform to which intracellular trafficking complexes are recruited and activated. Here, we investigated whether lysosomal trafficking in axons was altered by inhibition of GCase with the pharmacological agent Conduritol B Epoxide (CBE). Using live cell imaging in human male induced pluripotent human stem cell (iPSC)-derived forebrain neurons, we demonstrated that lysosomal transport was similar in both control and CBE-treated neurons. Furthermore, we tested whether lysosomal rupture, a process implicated in various neurodegenerative disorders, was affected by inhibition of GCase. Using L-leucyl-L-leucine methyl ester (LLoME) to induce lysosomal membrane damage and immunocytochemical staining for markers of lysosomal rupture, we found no difference in susceptibility to rupture between control and CBE-treated neurons. These results suggest the loss of GCase activity does not contribute to neurodegenerative disease by disrupting either lysosomal transport or rupture.
