35430039|a|COVID-19 is a life-threatening contagious virus that has spread across the globe rapidly. To reduce the outbreak impact of COVID-19 virus illness, continual identification and remote surveillance of patients are essential. Medical service delivery based on the Internet of Things (IoT) technology backed up by the fog-cloud paradigm is an efficient and time-sensitive solution for remote patient surveillance. Conspicuously, a comprehensive framework based on Radio Frequency Identification Device (RFID) and body-wearable sensor technologies supported by the fog-cloud platform is proposed for the identification and management of COVID-19 patients. The J48 decision tree is used to assess the infection degree of the user based on corresponding symptoms. RFID is used to detect Temporal Proximity Interactions (TPI) among users. Using TPI quantification, Temporal Network Analysis is used to analyze and track the current stage of the COVID-19 spread. The statistical performance and accuracy of the framework are assessed by utilizing synthetically-generated data for 250,000 users. Based on the comparative analysis, the proposed framework acquired an enhanced measure of classification accuracy, and sensitivity of 96.68% and 94.65% respectively. Moreover, significant improvement has been registered for proposed fog-cloud-based data analysis in terms of Temporal Delay efficacy, Precision, and F-measure.
