37323130|t|Atraumatic Splenic Rupture in Legionella pneumophila Pneumonia.
37323130|a|A previously fit 46-year-old male handyman presented to a rural hospital with a cough, fever, and epigastric pain without peritonism. The patient was admitted medically with symptoms and radiological appearances consistent with atypical community-acquired pneumonia. During the first 48 hours of admission, he suffered a significant haemodynamic deterioration and was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for vasoactive support. Following stabilisation, urgent abdominal CT imaging demonstrated splenic rupture with haematoma in the absence of historical trauma. Emergency splenectomy was performed; the histopathological examination was unremarkable. Investigations for the presenting complaint confirmed Legionella pneumophila serotype 1 pneumonia by urinary antigen testing. The patient was extubated on postoperative day 2 and stepped down from ICU to complete a 14-day course of azithromycin. Atraumatic splenic rupture is a rarely described clinical entity. The process can be subdivided into pathological and nonpathological (spontaneous) cases. Pathological atraumatic splenic rupture may occur in the context of wide-ranging aetiologies, including bacterial pneumonia; however, the association with Legionella pneumophila serotype 1 is exceptional, with this representing the eighth case in the medical literature.
