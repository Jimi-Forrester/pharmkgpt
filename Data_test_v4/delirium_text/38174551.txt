38174551|t|Elucidating the role of diet in maintaining gut health to reduce the risk of obesity, cardiovascular and other age-related inflammatory diseases: recent challenges and future recommendations.
38174551|a|A healthy balanced diet is crucial in protecting the immune system against infections and diseases. Poor diets, such as the Western diet, contribute to the development of metabolic diseases, hypertension, and obesity. Microbiota, primarily composed of different microorganisms and residing in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT), also play a significant role in maintaining gut health. Polyphenols and probiotics found in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds promote gut health and support the growth of beneficial bacteria. Different types of diets, their categories, and their impact on health are also mentioned. The relationship between diet, gut health, and the risk of developing obesity, cardiovascular diseases, and inflammatory diseases is discussed in this review article. The rationale behind the review concludes future recommendations for maintaining gut health and reducing the occurrence of obesity, cardiometabolic diseases, and other inflammatory diseases. There is also the need for standardized research methods, long-term studies, and translating scientific knowledge into practical dietary recommendations.
