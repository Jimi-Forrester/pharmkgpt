36077587|t|Targeting Persistent Neuroinflammation after Hypoxic-Ischemic Encephalopathy-Is Exendin-4 the Answer?
36077587|a|Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy is brain injury resulting from the loss of oxygen and blood supply around the time of birth. It is associated with a high risk of death or disability. The only approved treatment is therapeutic hypothermia. Therapeutic hypothermia has consistently been shown to significantly reduce the risk of death and disability in infants with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. However, approximately 29% of infants treated with therapeutic hypothermia still develop disability. Recent preclinical and clinical studies have shown that there is still persistent neuroinflammation even after treating with therapeutic hypothermia, which may contribute to the deficits seen in infants despite treatment. This suggests that potentially targeting this persistent neuroinflammation would have an additive benefit in addition to therapeutic hypothermia. A potential additive treatment is Exendin-4, which is a glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist. Preclinical data from various in vitro and in vivo disease models have shown that Exendin-4 has anti-inflammatory, mitochondrial protective, anti-apoptotic, anti-oxidative and neurotrophic effects. Although preclinical studies of the effect of Exendin-4 in perinatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury are limited, a seminal study in neonatal mice showed that Exendin-4 had promising neuroprotective effects. Further studies on Exendin-4 neuroprotection for perinatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury, including in large animal translational models are warranted to better understand its safety, window of opportunity and effectiveness as an adjunct with therapeutic hypothermia.
