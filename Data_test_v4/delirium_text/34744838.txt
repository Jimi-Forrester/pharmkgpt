34744838|t|Case Report: "Niemann-Pick Disease Type C in a Catatonic Patient Treated With Electroconvulsive Therapy".
34744838|a|We describe a case of an adolescent male with Niemann-Pick Type C (NP-C), a neurodegenerative lysosomal lipid storage disorder, who presented with recurrent catatonia which required repeated treatment with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). During the ECT-course, seizure threshold increased substantially, leading to questions about the influence of NP-C on neuronal excitability. In this exemplary ECT-patient, NP-C was diagnosed not until after the first ECT-course when initial psychopharmacology for catatonia had failed and antipsychotics and benzodiazepines showed significant side-effects. Clinicians should be aware of NP-C in patients referred for ECT, especially in the case of treatment resistance, neurological symptoms and intolerance of psychopharmacological drugs. As was shown in our NP-C patient, ECT can be repeatedly effective for catatonic features. In the literature, effectiveness of ECT in patients with NP-C has sparsely been reported. This case demonstrates that detection of NP-C is beneficial for patients because more optimal treatment with ECT can be provided earlier without further exposure to side-effects.
