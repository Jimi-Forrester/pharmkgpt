35669876|t|Prediction of Early Mortality Among Children With Moderate or Severe Traumatic Brain Injury Based on a Nomogram Integrating Radiological and Inflammation-Based Biomarkers.
35669876|a|Inflammation-based scores have been increasingly used for prognosis prediction in neurological diseases. This study aimed to investigate the predictive value of inflammation-based scores combined with radiological characteristics in children with moderate or severe traumatic brain injury (MS-TBI). A total of 104 pediatric patients with MS-TBI were retrospectively enrolled and randomly divided into training and validation cohorts at a 7:3 ratio. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify independent predictors of prognosis in pediatric patients with MS-TBI. A prognostic nomogram was constructed, and its predictive performance was validated in both the training and validation cohorts. Sex, admission platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio, and basal cistern status from initial CT findings were identified as independent prognostic predictors for children with MS-TBI in multivariate logistic analysis. Based on these findings, a nomogram was then developed and its concordance index values were 0.918 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.837-0.999] in the training cohort and 0.86 (95% CI: 0.70-1.00) in the validation cohort, which significantly outperformed those of the Rotterdam, Marshall, and Helsinki CT scores. The proposed nomogram, based on routine complete blood count and initial CT scan findings, can contribute to individualized prognosis prediction and clinical decision-making in children with MS-TBI.
