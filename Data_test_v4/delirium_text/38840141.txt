38840141|a|Uncontrolled neuroinflammation mediates traumatic brain injury (TBI) pathology and impairs recovery. Interleukin-6 (IL-6), a pleiotropic inflammatory regulator, is associated with poor clinical TBI outcomes. IL-6 operates via classical-signaling through membrane-bound IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) and trans-signaling through soluble IL-6 receptor (s)IL-6R. IL-6 trans-signaling specifically contributes to neuropathology, making it a potential precision therapeutic TBI target. Soluble glycoprotein 130 (sgp130) prevents IL-6 trans-signaling, sparing classical signaling, thus is a possible treatment. Mice received either controlled cortical impact (CCI) (6.0 +- 0.2 m/s; 2 mm; 50-60ms) or sham procedures. Vehicle (VEH) or sgp130-Fc was subcutaneously administered to sham (VEH or 1 microg) and CCI (VEH, 0.25 microg or 1 microg) mice on days 1, 4, 7, 10 and 13 post-surgery to assess effects on cognition [Morris Water Maze (MWM)] and ipsilateral hemisphere IL-6 related biomarkers (day 21 post-surgery). CCI + sgp130-Fc groups (0.25 microg and 1 microg) were combined for analysis given similar behavior/biomarker outcomes. CCI + VEH mice had longer latencies and path lengths to the platform and increased peripheral zone time versus Sham + VEH and Sham + sgp130-Fc mice, suggesting injury-induced impairments in learning and anxiety. CCI + sgp130-Fc mice had shorter platform latencies and path lengths and had decreased peripheral zone time, indicating a therapeutic benefit of sgp130-Fc after injury on learning and anxiety. Interestingly, Sham + sgp130-Fc mice had shorter platform latencies, path lengths and peripheral zone times than Sham + VEH mice, suggesting a beneficial effect of sgp130-Fc, independent of injury. CCI + VEH mice had increased brain IL-6 and decreased sgp130 levels versus Sham + VEH and Sham + sgp130-Fc mice. There was no treatment effect on IL-6, sIL6-R or sgp130 in Sham + VEH versus Sham + sgp130-Fc mice. There was also no treatment effect on IL-6 in CCI + VEH versus CCI + sgp130-Fc mice. However, CCI + sgp130-Fc mice had increased sIL-6R and sgp130 versus CCI + VEH mice, demonstrating sgp130-Fc treatment effects on brain biomarkers. Inflammatory chemokines (MIP-1beta, IP-10, MIG) were increased in CCI + VEH mice versus Sham + VEH and Sham + sgp130-Fc mice. However, CCI + sgp130-Fc mice had decreased chemokine levels versus CCI + VEH mice. IL-6 positively correlated, while sgp130 negatively correlated, with chemokine levels. Overall, we found that systemic sgp130-Fc treatment after CCI improved learning, decreased anxiety and reduced CCI-induced brain chemokines. Future studies will explore sex-specific dosing and treatment mechanisms for sgp130-Fc therapy.
