37838328|a|Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a neurological disorder that can increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) by three to five times more than those with normal cognition. To better understand the effects of daytime napping on MCI patients, a study was conducted to measure the effects of short naps on cognitive function, sleep quality, and quality of life. In total, 38 participants were asked to take 20-minute naps between 1:00p.m. and 3:00p.m. three times a week for eight weeks. The cognitive function of the participants was measured using the Thai version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (Thai-MoCA), their sleep quality was measured using the Thai version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (Thai-PSQI), and their quality of life was measured using the Thai version of the Quality of Life (Thai-QoL) questionnaire. After the 8-week period, the participants' scores for the Thai-MoCA and the Thai-QoL questionnaire showed a significant improvement (p < 0.001 for both), while the Thai-PSQI decreased significantly (p = 0.012). This suggests that taking short daytime naps can help to improve the cognitive function, sleep quality, and quality of life of MCI patients.
