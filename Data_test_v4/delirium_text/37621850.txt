37621850|a|Aim: The ability of a hen egg white bovine colostrum supplement to prevent severe COVID-19 was tested in a double-blind randomized control study. Methods: Adults with mild/moderate COVID-19, risk factors for severe disease, and within 5 days of symptom onset were assigned to the intervention (n = 77) or placebo (n = 79) arms. Symptoms were documented until day 42 post-enrollment and viral clearance was assessed at 11-13 days post-symptom onset. Results: One participant developed severe COVID-19. The severe-type symptom score was lower in the active arm at 11-13 days post-symptom onset (p = 0.049). Chest pain, fever/chills, joint pain/malaise, and sore throat were significantly less frequent in the active arm. No differences in viral clearance were observed. Conclusion: The intervention reduced symptoms of mild/moderate COVID-19. Clinical Trial Registration: DOH-27-062021-9191 (South African National Clinical Trials Register).
