38849742|t|Elevated level of multibranched complex glycan reveals an allergic tolerance status.
38849742|a|BACKGROUND: Allergen immunotherapy (AIT) is the only disease-modifying therapy that can achieve immune tolerance in patients through long-term allergen stimulation. Glycans play crucial roles in allergic disease, but no information on changes in glycosylation related to an allergic tolerance status has been reported. METHODS: Fifty-seven patients with house dust mite (HDM) allergies were enrolled. Twenty-eight patients were not treated with AIT, 19 patients had just entered the AIT maintenance treatment phase, and 10 patients had been in the AIT maintenance phase for more than 1 year. Serum protein N-glycans were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), which included linkage-specific sialylation information. RESULTS: Eighty-four N-glycans were identified in all three groups. Compared with the patients treated without AIT, the patients treated with AIT for a shorter time showed downregulated expression of high-mannose glycans and upregulated expression of alpha2,6 sialic acid. The patients treated with AIT in the maintenance phase for over 1 year, which was considered the start of immunological tolerance, showed downregulated expression of biantennary N-glycans and upregulated expression of multibranched and complex N-glycans. Nine N-glycans were changed between allergic and allergic-tolerant patients. CONCLUSIONS: The glycan form changed from mannose to a more complex type as treatment time increased, and multibranched complex glycans have the potential to be used as a monitoring indicator of immune tolerance. This serum N-glycome analysis provided important information for a deeper understanding of AIT treatment at the molecular level.
