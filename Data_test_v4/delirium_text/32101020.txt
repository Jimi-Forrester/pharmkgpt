32101020|a|Although there is a growing body of literature on the Alzheimer's disease (AD) personality changes, its relationships with personality disorders are still largely understudied. The relationships between the Five-Factor Model and the Axis II personality disorders were explored in the context of current and baseline personality in AD. The study was conducted with four groups who were administered the NEO-FFI and the PDQ-4+, mainly in interview sessions. Self-report measurement: AD Group, 40 female participants (M = 81.48 years); Control Group, 47 female participants from the population at large (M = 76.81 years). Baseline retrospective measurement: AD Group Informants (n = 40); Control Group Informants (n = 47). Three logistic regressions were computed. The baseline Neuroticism moderates the Neuroticism in the current clinical state. High Neuroticism, low Openness, high Cluster B, and baseline high Neuroticism, predicted the presence of AD diagnosis, accounting for 85% of the variance. In order to increase sensitivity towards an earlier diagnosis in AD, future empirically-based research should take into account an assessment set of structural personality variables.
