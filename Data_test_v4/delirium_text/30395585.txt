30395585|t|Comparative transcriptomics identifies genes differentially expressed in the intestine of a new fast-growing strain of common carp with higher unsaturated fatty acid content in muscle.
30395585|a|We have created a new, fast-growing strain of common carp with higher unsaturated fatty acid content in muscle. To better understand the impacts of gene regulation in intestinal tissue on growth and unsaturated fatty acid content, we conducted a comparative RNA-Seq transcriptome analysis between intestine samples of Selected and Control groups (and corroborated selected results by PCR). After eight weeks of cage culture, weight gain of the Selected group was 20.84% higher. In muscles of the control group, monounsaturated fatty acids (FAs) were more abundant, whereas polyunsaturated FAs were more abundant in muscles of the Selected group. In total, we found 106 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the two groups. Only the endocytosis pathway was significantly enriched in DEGs, with two upregulated genes: il2rb and ehd1. The latter is involved in the growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor (Gh/Igf) axis, which plays a key role in the regulation of growth in animals. tll2, which is known to be associated with intestinal regeneration, was extremely highly upregulated in both transcriptomic (infinite) and qPCR (610.70) analyses. Two of the upregulated genes are associated with the fatty acid metabolism, several genes are likely to be indicators of heightened transcription levels, several are associated with metabolic and developmental roles, several with neuronal functions (including two with vision), several with the immune system, and two downregulated genes with the development of vasculature. The higher growth rate of the Selected group is likely to be at least partially attributed to increased endocytosis efficiency and genetically-driven behavioural differences (higher aggression levels). There are some indications that this new strain might have slightly impaired immune responses, and a higher propensity for inherited diseases leading to sight impairment, as well for neurodegenerative diseases in general, but these indications still need to be confirmed.
