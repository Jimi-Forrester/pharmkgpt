37717026|a|Botulinum toxin-A (BTX) administration into muscle is an established treatment for conditions with excessive muscle contraction. However, botulinum therapy has short-term effectiveness, and high-dose injection of BTX could induce neutralizing antibodies against BTX. Therefore, prolonging its effects could be beneficial in a clinical situation. Insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF1R) and its ligands, insulin-like growth factor (IGF) -I and II, regulate the physiological and pathological processes of the nervous system. It has been suggested that IGF1R is involved in the process after BTX administration, but the specific regeneration mechanism remains unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to determine how inhibition of IGF1R signaling pathway affects BTX-induced muscle paralysis. The results showed that anti-IGF1R antibody administration inhibited the recovery from BTX-induced neurogenic paralysis, and the synaptic components at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), mainly post-synaptic components, were significantly affected by the antibody. In addition, the wet weight or frequency distribution of the cross-sectional area of the muscle fibers was regulated by IGF1R, and sequential antibody administration following BTX treatment increased the number of Pax7+-satellite cells in the gastrocnemius (GC) muscle, independent of NMJ recovery. Moreover, BTX treatment upregulated mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)/S6 kinase signaling pathway, HDAC4, Myog, Fbxo32/MAFbx/Atrogin-1 pathway, and transcription of synaptic components, but not autophagy. Finally, IGF1R inhibition affected only mTOR/S6 kinase translational signaling in the GC muscle. In conclusion, the IGF1R signaling pathway is critical for NMJ regeneration via specific translational signals. IGF1R inhibition could be highly beneficial in clinical practice by decreasing the number of injections and total dose of BTX due to the prolonged duration of the effect.
