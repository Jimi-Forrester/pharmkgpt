35670630|t|Early integration of palliative care for patients with haematological malignancies.
35670630|a|Early palliative care (EPC) significantly improves quality of life, symptoms, and satisfaction with care for patients with advanced cancer. International organizations have recognized and promoted the role of palliative care as a distinct specialty, advocating its involvement throughout the cancer trajectory. Although patients with haematologic malignancies (HMs) have a comparable symptom burden to patients with solid tumours, they face multiple barriers to EPC integration. In this review, we discuss these barriers, present updated evidence from clinical trials of EPC in HMs and propose models to support EPC integration into care for patients with HMs.
