36738450|t|The relationship between hippocampal amyloid beta burden and spatial distribution of neurofibrillary degeneration.
36738450|a|INTRODUCTION: Neurofibrillary degeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD) typically involves the entorhinal cortex and CA1 subregion of the hippocampus early in the disease process, whereas in primary age-related tauopathy (PART), there is an early selective vulnerability of the CA2 subregion. METHODS: Image analysis-based quantitative pixel assessments were used to objectively evaluate amyloid beta (Abeta) burden in the medial temporal lobe in relation to the distribution of hyperphosphorylated-tau (p-tau) in 142 cases of PART and AD. RESULTS: Entorhinal, CA1, CA3, and CA4 p-tau deposition levels are significantly correlated with Abeta burden, while CA2 p-tau is not. Furthermore, the CA2/CA1 p-tau ratio is inversely correlated with Abeta burden and distribution. In addition, cognitive impairment is correlated with overall p-tau burden. DISCUSSION: These data indicate that the presence and extent of medial temporal lobe Abeta may determine the distribution and spread of neurofibrillary degeneration. The resulting p-tau distribution patterns may discriminate between PART and AD. HIGHLIGHTS: Subregional hyperphosphorylated-tau (p-tau) distribution is influenced by hippocampal amyloid beta burden. Higher CA2/CA1 p-tau ratio is predictive of primary age-related tauopathy-like neuropathology. Cognitive function is correlated with the overall hippocampal p-tau burden.
