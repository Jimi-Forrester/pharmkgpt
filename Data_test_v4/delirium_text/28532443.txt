28532443|a|BACKGROUND: Earlier studies of nursing home patients show a high prevalence of dementia, neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS), pain, and dependency in activities of daily living. The REDIC-NH cohort was set up to study the disease course and the resources used in patients with dementia in Norway. The aim of this paper was to describe the methods and the data collection, and to present selected data about patients at admission to a nursing home. METHODS: We included 696 patients at admission to a nursing home and followed them with biannual assessments until death. Baseline data were collected between March 2012 and November 2014. In October 2016, patients had either completed an 18-month follow-up (n = 349), passed 18 months without assessments (n = 22), or left the study (n = 324). Data on demographics, cognition, NPS, activities of daily living (ADL) functioning, physical health, medication, Quality of Life (QoL), resource use, and caregiver burden, in addition to DNA samples were collected. RESULTS: Mean age of the participants at inclusion was 84.5 years (SD 7.5, range 50 - 105), 63.9% were women. According to data collected in the study, 83.8% had dementia, but only 55.9% of them had a diagnosis of dementia registered in their records. The most frequent dementia diagnosis was Alzheimer's disease, which was present in 71% of those with dementia. Patients with dementia more often experienced delusions, hallucinations, agitation, anxiety, disinhibition, irritability, and aberrant motor behaviour compared to patients without dementia. Depression and anxiety were the most common NPS symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Dementia and NPS were highly prevalent among persons admitted to nursing homes. Only 55.9% of the patients with dementia had a diagnosis of dementia registered in their records.
