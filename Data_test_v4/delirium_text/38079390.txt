38079390|t|Rational Development of a Small-Molecule Activator of CK1gamma2 That Decreases C99 and Beta-Amyloid Levels.
38079390|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the accumulation of beta-amyloid (Abeta), C99, and Tau in vulnerable areas of the brain. Despite extensive research, current strategies to lower Abeta levels have shown limited efficacy in slowing the cognitive decline associated with AD. Recent findings suggest that C99 may also play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of AD. Our laboratory has discovered that CK1gamma2 phosphorylates Presenilin 1 at the gamma-secretase complex, leading to decreased C99 and Abeta levels. Thus, CK1gamma2 activation appears as a promising therapeutic target to lower both C99 and Abeta levels. In this study, we demonstrate that CK1gamma2 is inhibited by intramolecular autophosphorylation and describe a high-throughput screen designed to identify inhibitors of CK1gamma2 autophosphorylation. We hypothesize that these inhibitors could lead to CK1gamma2 activation and increased PS1-Ser367 phosphorylation, ultimately reducing C99 and Abeta levels. Using cultured cells, we investigated the impact of these compounds on C99 and Abeta concentrations and confirmed that CK1gamma2 activation effectively reduced their levels. Our results provide proof of concept that CK1gamma2 is an attractive therapeutic target for AD. Future studies should focus on the identification of specific compounds that can inhibit CK1gamma2 autophosphorylation and evaluate their efficacy in preclinical models of AD. These studies will pave the way for the development of novel therapeutics for the treatment of AD.
