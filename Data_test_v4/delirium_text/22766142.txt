22766142|t|Care of the patient in excited delirium.
22766142|a|Patients with excited delirium present a challenge to both law enforcement and health care personnel because handcuffs, the traditional method used to keep persons from harming themselves and others, may be fatal. The patient's survival depends upon rapid recognition and treatment, including chemical sedation, decreased environmental stimulation, intravenous fluids, and other supportive interventions. Excited delirium protocols should be established to ensure rapid and appropriate treatment to ensure patient survival and the safety of those caring for them.
