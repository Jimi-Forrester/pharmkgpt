38273284|a|BACKGROUND: In the United States, cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the leading cause of death and disability in women. CVD-modifiable risk factors, including poor diet quality and inadequate physical activity, can be addressed through evidence-based interventions (EBIs). Strong Hearts Healthy Communities (SHHC) is an EBI that has demonstrated effectiveness in reducing CVD risk and improving health outcomes among rural white women. The aims of this study were to understand the general health, diet, and physical activity-related needs and goals of women living in an urban community, to inform the tailoring and adaptation of the SHHC EBI to an urban setting and more diverse population. METHODS: Focus groups (FGs) were conducted with African American/Black and Hispanic/Latinx women in the Dallas metropolitan area who had a BMI >= 25 kg/m2 and engaged in <= 150 min per week of moderate physical activity. The data were coded using a team-based, deductive, and thematic analysis approach, that included multiple coders and in-depth discussions. RESULTS: Four FGs with a total of 18 participants (79% Black and 21% Latinx) were conducted, and three themes were developed: (1) participants had adequate knowledge and positive attitudes towards healthy living but faced many barriers to practicing healthy behaviors; (2) culturally-based beliefs and community practices exerted a strong influence on behaviors related to food and stress, revealing barriers to healthy eating and generational differences in stress and stress management; (3) participants desired a more individualized approach to nutrition and physical activity interventions that included familiar and enjoyable activities and social support centered around shared health goals. CONCLUSIONS: The SHHC intervention and similar health programs for Black/African American and Hispanic/Latinx women in urban settings should emphasize individualized nutrition and practical skills for healthy eating with accessible, familiar, and enjoyable exercises. Additionally, stress management strategies should be culturally and generationally sensitive and social support, whether through family, friends, or other program participants, should be based on shared health goals.
