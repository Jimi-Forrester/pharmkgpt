33444912|t|RyR2 calcium channels in the spotlight-I'm ready for my close up, Dr. Alzheimer!
33444912|a|While various hypotheses surrounding the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) have waxed and waned over the years, the calcium hypothesis of aging [1] has maintained its steady trajectory since the early 1990's, albeit often as the understudy. Here, Yao et al., [2] further implicate intracellular calcium dysregulation in AD pathogenesis, and focus the spotlight on the elusive ryanodine receptor-2 isoform.
