32742605|a|OBJECTIVES: Resistance to medications is one of the main complications in chemotherapy of cancer. It has been shown that some multidrug resistant cancer cells indicate more sensitivity against cytotoxic effects of TNF-alpha compared to their parental cells. Our previous findings indicated vulnerability of the mitoxantrone-resistant breast cancer cells MCF-7/MX to cell death induced by TNF-alpha compared to the parent cells MCF-7. In this study, we performed a comparative proteomics analysis for identification of proteins involved in induction of higher susceptibility of MCF-7/MX cells to cytotoxic effect of TNF-alpha. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Intensity of protein spots in 2D gel electrophoresis profiles of MCF-7 and MCF-7/MX cells were compared with Image Master Platinum 6.0 software. Selected differential protein-spots were identified with MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry and database searching. Pathway analyses of identified proteins were performed using PANTHER, KEGG PATHWAY, Gene MANIA and STRING databases. Western blot was performed for confirmation of the proteomics results. RESULTS: Our results indicated that 48 hr exposure to TNF-alpha induced 87% death in MCF-7/MX cells compared to 19% death in MCF-7 cells. Forty landmarks per 2D gel electrophoresis were matched by Image Master Software. Six proteins were identified with mass spectrometry. Western blot showed that 14-3-3gamma and p53 proteins were expressed higher in MCF-7/MX cells treated with TNF-alpha compared to MCF-7 cells treated with TNF-alpha. CONCLUSION: Our results showed that 14-3-3 gamma, prohibitin, peroxiredoxin 2 and P53 proteins which were expressed differentially in MCF-7/MX cells treated with TNF-alpha may involve in the induction of higher rates of cell death in these cells compared to TNF-alpha-treated MCF-7 cells.
