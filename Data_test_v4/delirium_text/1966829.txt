1966829|t|LR White embedding allows a multi-method approach to the analysis of brain tissue from patients with Alzheimer's disease.
1966829|a|Light (LM) and electron (EM) microscope comparisons of the cytochemistry and immunocytochemistry of neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, the main histopathological changes in the brains of Alzheimer's disease sufferers, have been almost impossible because of the disparity between the two technologies. By embedding unosmicated brain tissue in the acrylic resin LR White, direct comparisons can be made between techniques applied at the LM level with those at the EM level. After partial dehydration in 70% ethanol, the tissue is embedded by rapid infiltration and polymerization at 0 degrees C, which has been shown to maximally preserve tissue immunoreactivity. Semithin sections are then receptive to routine LM stains, silver stains e.g. Gomori's methenamine silver, and immunocytochemistry with immunoperoxidase or immunocolloidal gold. Serial thin sections are stable in the EM and can be immunolabelled and directly compared with their LM counterparts. Results from the use of a mouse monoclonal antibody against beta-amyloid and a rabbit polyclonal antibody against ubiquitin are presented. LR White resin includes no elements other than carbon, oxygen and nitrogen, of which it is composed, so that sections of it are valuable for sensitive X-ray energy dispersive microanalysis.
