16973370|t|Differential CSF butyrylcholinesterase levels in Alzheimer's disease patients with the ApoE epsilon4 allele, in relation to cognitive function and cerebral glucose metabolism.
16973370|a|Butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) is increased in the cerebral cortex of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, particularly those carrying epsilon4 allele of the apolipoprotein E gene (ApoE) and certain BuChE variants that predict increased AD risk and poor response to anticholinesterase therapy. We measured BuChE activity and protein level in CSF of eighty mild AD patients in relation to age, gender, ApoE epsilon4 genotype, cognition and cerebral glucose metabolism (CMRglc). BuChE activity was 23% higher in men than women (p<0.03) and 40-60% higher in ApoE epsilon4 negative patients than in those carrying one or two epsilon4 alleles (p<0.0004). CSF BuChE level correlated with cortical CMRglc. Patients with high to moderate CSF BuChE showed better cognitive function scores than others. We hypothesize that CSF BuChE varies inversely with BuChE in cortical amyloid plaques. Thus, low BuChE in a patient's CSF may predict extensive incorporation in neuritic plaques, increased neurotoxicity and greater central neurodegeneration.
