33308277|t|Investigation of opposition to diagnostic or therapeutic procedures in older people hospitalized in acute geriatric services: the OPTAH pilot study protocol.
33308277|a|BACKGROUND: Shared decision-making is a process that involves collaborative discussions between a patient and a care team to ensure informed healthcare decisions. This process becomes more complex when the older person's decision-making capacities are affected. In these situations, surrogate decision-making processes are used to define a person-centered care plan. Despite these processes, the implementation of the care plan defined in the best interest of the patient may nevertheless be rejected by the patient, particularly in cases of neurocognitive disorders or delirium. This concept of opposition and/or refusal is frequently used in research. This is not yet well understood in the medical literature, and there is a lack of consensus on its definition. We, therefore, explored this concept by defining opposition to diagnostic or therapeutic proposals. METHOD: Our pilot study protocol is based on a mixed methodology (epidemiological and qualitative research) to quantify this phenomenon, validate the proposed definition, and explore its core elements. Opposition and refusal of care will be quantified, and semi-structured interviews will be conducted with patients, their relatives, and referring carers. Multidisciplinary meetings that will be associated with these situations will also be observed and analyzed. Methodological approaches that can be used to explore opposition and refusal of care in a scientific, reproducible framework are presented. This methodology considers the specificities of the geriatric, polypathological population with neurocognitive disorders. DISCUSSION: Opposition and refusal of care are key concepts in clinical research on ethics, particularly in the geriatric field. These concepts are frequently mentioned in studies involving older patients but have not been specifically defined or studied. This study would undoubtedly lead to greater awareness among professional caregivers and relatives of the significance of such opposition, and more respectful interactions in these complex hospitalization cases.
