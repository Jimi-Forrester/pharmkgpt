24341043|a|Delirium is a clinical sign of acute cerebral dysfunction. It is characterized by consciousness alterations with attention impairment and mentally disorganization. Frequency of delirium is 40-80% in general intensive care and more in patients in neurointensive care unit. We tried to assess citicoline (Ceraxon, Nycomed) safety and efficacy in treatment of postoperative delirium in patients with tumors of chiasm-sellar area of brain. 12 patients were included in citicoline group and 8--in control group. In both group combined type of delirium was common: 83.3% and 75%, accordingly. Citicoline didn't influence on delirium duration. Median of duration of mechanical ventilation was 1.5 and 6 days; mean and standard deviation were 10.5 +/- 15.4 and 17.5 +/- 27.9 days. Median of length of stay in ICU was 7 and 9.5 days; mean and standard deviation were 25.4 +/- 33.1 and 14.9 +/- 15.1 days. These results show that citicoline didn't influence on duration of mechanical ventilation and length of stay in ICU. Outcomes were similar in both groups, but frequency of full functional state recovery in citicoline group was significantly higher: 5 (41.7%) to 2 (25%) in control group (p < 0.05). We consider that citicoline therapy is safe for patients with tumors of chiasm-sellar area and lead to increasing of frequency of full functional state recovery.
