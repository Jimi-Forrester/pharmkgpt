39064711|t|Oral Exposure to Microplastics Affects the Neurochemical Plasticity of Reactive Neurons in the Porcine Jejunum.
39064711|a|Plastics are present in almost every aspect of our lives. Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is commonly used in the food industry. Microparticles can contaminate food and drinks, posing a threat to consumers. The presented study aims to determine the effect of microparticles of PET on the population of neurons positive for selected neurotransmitters in the enteric nervous system of the jejunum and histological structure. An amount of 15 pigs were divided into three groups (control, receiving 0.1 g, and 1 g/day/animal orally). After 28 days, fragments of the jejunum were collected for immunofluorescence and histological examination. The obtained results show that histological changes (injury of the apical parts of the villi, accumulations of cellular debris and mucus, eosinophil infiltration, and hyperaemia) were more pronounced in pigs receiving a higher dose of microparticles. The effect on neuronal nitric oxide synthase-, and substance P-positive neurons, depends on the examined plexus and the dose of microparticles. An increase in the percentage of galanin-positive neurons and a decrease in cocaine and amphetamine-regulated transcript-, vesicular acetylcholine transporter-, and vasoactive intestinal peptide-positive neurons do not show such relationships. The present study shows that microparticles can potentially have neurotoxic and pro-inflammatory effects, but there is a need for further research to determine the mechanism of this process and possible further effects.
