23576885|t|Aging and neuroplasticity.
23576885|a|Neuroplasticity can be defined as a final common pathway of neurobiological processes, including structural, functional or molecular mechanisms, that result in stability or compensation for age- or disease-related changes. The papers in this issue address the aging process, as well as depression, dementia, and stroke and a range of interventions, including manipulations in behavior (physical and cognitive activity/exercise), physiological factors (caloric restriction, cholesterol), pharmacologic treatments (AMPA receptors) and manipulation of brain magnetic fields and electrical activity (transcranial magnetic stimulation, magnetic seizure therapy, and deep brain stimulation).This editorial will address different facets of neuroplasticity, the need for translational research to interpret neuroimaging data thought to reflect neuroplasticity in the human brain, and the next steps for testing interventions in aging and in disease.
