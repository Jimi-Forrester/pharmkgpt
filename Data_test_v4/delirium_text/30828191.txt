30828191|a|Hematopoietic failure (HF) has been observed in trauma hemorrhagic shock (T/HS) patients. Multiple factors are involved. Elevated serum levels of cytokines, catecholamine, granulocyte colony stimulating factor, peripheral blood hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) and decreased expression of erythropoietin receptor are associated with HF among T/HS. HF leads to anaemia, susceptibility to infection, sepsis and multi-organ failure. There is a lack of molecular understanding of HF and its potential therapeutic strategies. Cell-based therapy has ability to modulate the production of inflammatory cytokines, vascular dysfunction, tissue damage and apoptosis. Human-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) derived HPCs may have the ability to restore HF in T/HS. Autologous cell-based iPSC have great promises for various diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and spinal cord injury without ethical concerns. Similarly, treatment with iPSC derived hematopoietic stem cells can used for the treatment of HF among T/HS and may also improve the outcome. Here, we review the potential of human iPSC derived HSC to reversed HF following T/HS.
