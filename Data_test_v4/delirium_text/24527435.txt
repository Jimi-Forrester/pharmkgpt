24527435|a|In this work the effects of simple imputations are studied, regarding the integration of multimodal data originating from different patients. Two separate datasets of cutaneous melanoma are used, an image analysis (dermoscopy) dataset together with a transcriptomic one, specifically DNA microarrays. Each modality is related to a different set of patients, and four imputation methods are employed to the formation of a unified, integrative dataset. The application of backward selection together with ensemble classifiers (random forests), followed by principal components analysis and linear discriminant analysis, illustrates the implication of the imputations on feature selection and dimensionality reduction methods. The results suggest that the expansion of the feature space through the data integration, achieved by the exploitation of imputation schemes in general, aids the classification task, imparting stability as regards the derivation of putative classifiers. In particular, although the biased imputation methods increase significantly the predictive performance and the class discrimination of the datasets, they still contribute to the study of prominent features and their relations. The fusion of separate datasets, which provide a multimodal description of the same pathology, represents an innovative, promising avenue, enhancing robust composite biomarker derivation and promoting the interpretation of the biomedical problem studied.
