36969500|t|Hospital at home: emergence of a high-value model of care delivery.
36969500|a|Background: With increasing healthcare demands for acute illness in patients especially in the times of pandemic, healthcare organizations require modern solutions. Hospital at home (HaH) is one such tool that has the potential to solve these problems without compromising the care of the patients. Main body: Hospitals have been the conventional setting for managing acute sickness patients; however, it could be a very challenging environment for a few patients, especially for the older population who are highly susceptible to hospital-acquired infections. Health care in a hospital setting can also be very expensive, as it often involves a lot of healthcare professionals providing care. HaH service can provide the same quality of care expected in traditional settings. Conclusions: The median length of stay and the rate of readmissions were lower in people under HaH care. Compared with patients in a hospital setting, patients in HaH had better clinical outcomes. HaH unit provides an integrated, flexible, easy-to-scale platform that can be cost-effectively adapted to high-demand situations.
