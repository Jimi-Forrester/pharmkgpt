28190436|t|Neurologic complications of cardiac and vascular surgery.
28190436|a|This chapter will provide an overview of the major neurologic complications of common cardiac and vascular surgeries, such as coronary artery bypass grafting and carotid endarterectomy. Neurologic complications after cardiac and vascular surgeries can cause significant morbidity and mortality, which can negate the beneficial effects of the intervention. Some of the complications to be discussed include ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, seizures, delirium, cognitive dysfunction, cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome, cranial nerve injuries, and peripheral neuropathies. The severity of these complications can range from mild to lethal. The etiology of complications can include a variety of mechanisms, which can differ based on the type of cardiac or vascular surgery that is performed. Our knowledge about neuropathology, prevention, and management of surgical complications is growing and will be discussed in this chapter. It is imperative for clinicians to be familiar with these complications in order to narrow the differential diagnosis, start early management, anticipate the natural history, and improve outcomes.
