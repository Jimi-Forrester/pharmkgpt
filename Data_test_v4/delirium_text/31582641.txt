31582641|t|Neuroendoscopic Evacuation for Spontaneous Cerebellar Hemorrhage Is a Safe and Secure Approach and May Become a Mainstream Technique.
31582641|a|Patients with spontaneous cerebellar hemorrhage present with rapidly deteriorating neurological symptoms due to a hematoma-induced mass effect in the brainstem. We compared the standard surgical approach of a suboccipital craniectomy with neuroendoscopic surgery for treating spontaneous cerebellar hemorrhage. We performed a retrospective analysis of 41 patients indicated for surgery to treat spontaneous cerebellar hemorrhage. At our hospital, craniectomy was performed until 2010, and neuroendoscopic surgery was performed thereafter when a qualified surgeon was available. Duration of surgery and intraoperative blood loss were lower in the neuroendoscopic surgery group. The extent of hematoma removal and the percentage of patients requiring shunting were similar between groups. The mass effect was resolved in all patients in both groups, and no substantial re-bleeding was observed in either group. The outcomes at discharge were comparable between the two groups. Our surgeons used the supine lateral position, which involves fewer burdens to the patient than the prone position. Selection of the site of the burr hole is important to avoid the midline and to avoid the area exactly above the transverse and sigmoid sinus. Our results suggest that minimally invasive neuroendoscopic surgery is safe and superior to craniectomy due to shortened duration of surgery and decreased intraoperative bleeding.
