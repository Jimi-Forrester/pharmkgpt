19299649|t|Delirium in children with HIV/AIDS.
19299649|a|Delirium in children has received little attention from researchers until very recently, despite being a frequently encountered clinical problem, particularly in the context of human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS). In this article, we report 3 cases of severe hyperactive delirium occurring in children with advanced HIV/AIDS in the context of probable underlying HIV encephalopathy and complex drug-drug interactions. We also present a hypothesis in relation to HIV-associated delirium as a potential neuropsychiatric manifestation of the immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome in children commenced on highly active antiretroviral therapy.
