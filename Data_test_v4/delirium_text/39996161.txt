39996161|a|The 2024 revised edition of the Japanese Clinical Practice Guidelines for Management of Sepsis and Septic Shock (J-SSCG 2024) is published by the Japanese Society of Intensive Care Medicine and the Japanese Association for Acute Medicine. This is the fourth revision since the first edition was published in 2012. The purpose of the guidelines is to assist healthcare providers in making appropriate decisions in the treatment of sepsis and septic shock, leading to improved patient outcomes. We aimed to create guidelines that are easy to understand and use for physicians who recognize sepsis and provide initial management, specialized physicians who take over the treatment, and multidisciplinary healthcare providers, including nurses, physical therapists, clinical engineers, and pharmacists. The J-SSCG 2024 covers the following nine areas: diagnosis of sepsis and source control, antimicrobial therapy, initial resuscitation, blood purification, disseminated intravascular coagulation, adjunctive therapy, post-intensive care syndrome, patient and family care, and pediatrics. In these areas, we extracted 78 important clinical issues. The GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) method was adopted for making recommendations, and the modified Delphi method was used to determine recommendations by voting from all committee members. As a result, 42 GRADE-based recommendations, 7 good practice statements, and 22 information-to-background questions were created as responses to clinical questions. We also described 12 future research questions.
