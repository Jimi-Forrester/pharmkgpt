38570564|a|This study examines the manufacturing, characterization, and biological evaluation of platinum nanoparticles, which were synthesized by Enterobacter cloacae and coated with Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) and Resveratrol (RSV). The formation of PtNPs was confirmed with the change of color from dark yellow to black, which was due to the bioreduction of platinum chloride by E. cloacae. BSA and RSV functionalization enhanced these nanoparticles' biocompatibility and therapeutic potential. TGA, SEM, XRD, and FTIR were employed for characterization, where PtNPs and drug conjugation-related functional groups were studied by FTIR. XRD confirmed the crystalline nature of PtNPs and Pt-BSA-RSV NPs, while TGA and SEM showed thermal stability and post-drug coating morphological changes. Designed composite was also found to be biocompatible in nature in hemolytic testing, indicating their potential in Biomedical applications. After confirmation of PtNPs based nanocaompsite synthesis, they were examined for anti-bacterial, anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-cancer properties. Pt-BSA-RSV NPs showed higher concentration-dependent DPPH scavenging activity, which measured antioxidant capability. Enzyme inhibition tests demonstrated considerable anti-inflammatory activity against COX-2 and 15-LOX enzymes. In in vitro anticancer studies, Pt-BSA-RSV NPs effectively killed human ovarian cancer cells. This phenomenon was demonstrated to be facilitated by the acidic environment of cancer, as the drug release assay confirmed the release of RSV from the NP formulation in the acidic environment. Finally, Molecular docking also demonstrated that RSV has strong potential as an anti-oxidant, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer agent. Overall, in silico and in vitro investigations in the current study showed good medicinal applications for designed nanocomposites, however, further in-vivo experiments must be conducted to validate our findings.
