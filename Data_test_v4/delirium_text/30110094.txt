30110094|a|OBJECTIVE: to identify risk factors for falls in hospitalized adult patients. METHODS: a matched case-control study (one control for each case). A quantitative study conducted in clinical and surgical units of a teaching hospital in Southern Brazil. The sample comprised 358 patients. Data were collected over 18 months between 2013-2014. Data analysis was performed with descriptive statistics and conditional logistic regression using Microsoft Excel and SPSS version 18.0. RESULTS: risk factors identified were: disorientation/confusion [OR 4.25 (1.99 to 9.08), p<0.001]; frequent urination [OR 4.50 (1.86 to 10.87), p=0.001]; walking limitation [OR 4.34 (2.05 to 9.14), p<0.001]; absence of caregiver [OR 0.37 (0.22 to 0.63), p<0.001]; postoperative period [OR 0.50 (0.26 to 0.94), p=0.03]; and number of medications administered within 72 hours prior the fall [OR 1.20 (1.04 to 1.39) p=0.01]. CONCLUSION: risk for falls is multifactorial. However, understanding these factors provides support to clinical decision-making and positively influences patient safety.
