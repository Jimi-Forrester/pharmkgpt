37352918|a|The FOX family of transcription factors was originally identified in 1989, comprising the FOXA to FOXS subfamilies. FOXO3, a well-known member of the FOXO subfamily, is widely expressed in various human organs and tissues, with higher expression levels in the ovary, skeletal muscle, heart, and spleen. The biological effects of FOXO3 are mostly determined by its phosphorylation, which occurs in the nucleus or cytoplasm. Phosphorylation of FOXO3 in the nucleus can promote its translocation into the cytoplasm and inhibit its transcriptional activity. In contrast, phosphorylation of FOXO3 in the cytoplasm leads to its translocation into the nucleus and exerts regulatory effects on biological processes, such as inflammation, aerobic glycolysis, autophagy, apoptosis, oxidative stress, cell cycle arrest and DNA damage repair. Additionally, FOXO3 isoform 2 acts as an important suppressor of osteoclast differentiation. FOXO3 can also interfere with the development of various diseases, including inhibiting the proliferation and invasion of tumor cells, blocking the production of inflammatory factors in autoimmune diseases, and inhibiting beta-amyloid deposition in Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, FOXO3 slows down the aging process and exerts anti-aging effects by delaying telomere attrition, promoting cell self-renewal, and maintaining genomic stability. This review suggests that changes in the levels and post-translational modifications of FOXO3 protein can maintain organismal homeostasis and improve age-related diseases, thus counteracting aging. Moreover, this may indicate that alterations in FOXO3 protein levels are also crucial for longevity, offering new perspectives for therapeutic strategies targeting FOXO3.
