29475219|t|A Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome Without Rigidity.
29475219|a|Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is an uncommon but potentially lethal idiosyncratic reaction which may emerge in the aftermath of the treatments with neuroleptics demonstrating itself with the symptoms of altered consciousness, high fever, impaired autonomic functions, and muscle rigidity. Although various risk factors have been identified for NMS, its etiology is not completely known. The mortality and morbidity related with NMS could be reduced by early diagnosis, interruption of the neuroleptics used within a short period and aggressive treatment. Our case is different from general NMS cases due to lack of rigidity. A NMS case which developed within a short time in the aftermath of multiple antipsychotic use and wherein no rigidity was observed shall be discussed in this case report.
