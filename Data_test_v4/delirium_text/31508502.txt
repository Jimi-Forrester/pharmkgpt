31508502|a|Could an overly deep sedation be anticipated from ElectroEncephaloGram (EEG) patterns? We report here motifs hidden in the EEG signal that predict the appearance of Iso-Electric Suppressions (IES), observed during epileptic encephalopathies, drug intoxications, comatose, brain death or during anesthetic over-dosage that are considered to be detrimental. To show that IES occurrences can be predicted from EEG traces dynamics, we focus on transient suppression of the alpha rhythm (8-14 Hz) recorded for 80 patients, that had a Propofol target controlled infusion of 5 mug/ml during a general anesthesia. We found that the first time of appearance as well as changes in duration of these Alpha-Suppressions (alphaS) are two parameters that anticipate the appearance of IES. Using machine learning, we predicted IES appearance from the first 10 min of EEG (AUC of 0.93). To conclude, transient motifs in the alpha rhythm predict IES during anesthesia and can be used to identify patients, with higher risks of post-operative complications.
