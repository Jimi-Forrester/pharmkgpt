34064611|t|Withdrawal Symptoms Following Discontinuation of Vortioxetine-Retrospective Chart Review.
34064611|a|The efficacy of vortioxetine has been proven in many studies, but data concerning discontinuation symptoms (DS) after vortioxetine withdrawal is scarce. The aim of our study is to systematically evaluate the prevalence, determinants, and clinical features of vortioxetine DS in a retrospective chart review. Data were obtained from medical records of 263 adult patients with depressive disorders who discontinued former vortioxetine treatment. DS were observed in eight (3%) patients after 71-375 days (median 272) of treatment. DS emerged after median three days following vortioxetine withdrawal and lasted for median seven days. The clinical presentation of DS involved: emotional lability (100% of patients), irritability (75%), sudden worsening of mood (75%), nervousness (37.5%), and agitation (37.5%). Median DESS score was four (range of four to six). DS were significantly more prevalent after accidental vs. planned discontinuation (adjusted p = 0.011) and were less frequent after switching to a different antidepressant vs. ceasing pharmacotherapy (adjusted p = 0.0165). DS appeared more often if patients discontinued therapy without medical consultation (adjusted p = 0.033). The occurrence of DS was not associated with the dose and way of drug discontinuation (sudden vs. gradual). In sum, our results show that clinicians should be aware that vortioxetine withdrawal is associated with the possibility of DS.
