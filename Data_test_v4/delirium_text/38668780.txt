38668780|t|Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias Diagnosis in the United States Among US-Born and Foreign-Born White, Black, Hispanic, and Asian Older Adults.
38668780|a|Timely clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) is important for resource allocation, mitigating safety concerns, and improving quality of life. While studies have examined ADRD diagnosis disparities by race/ethnicity, few include its intersection with nativity. Our aims were to (1) estimate the odds of diagnosed ADRD among US- and foreign-born racial/ethnic groups compared to US-born White older adults and (2) make comparisons by nativity within each racial/ethnic group. We linked 2000-2017 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) and 2001-2018 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) data (65 + years; n = 38,033). Race/ethnicity and nativity were measured using NHIS data. Diagnosed ADRD was determined using ICD-9 (290/294/331/797) or ICD-10 (F01/F03/G30/G31) billing codes created from self-reports during MEPS household interviews. Bivariate and multivariable analyses were adjusted for covariates based on Anderson's behavioral model of health services use. US-born Black (OR = 1.74; 95% CI = 1.48-2.05), Hispanic (OR = 1.62; 95% CI = 1.14-2.29), and foreign-born Hispanic (OR = 1.63; 95% CI = 1.24-2.15) older adults, but not foreign-born Black or Asian older adults, had higher odds of diagnosed ADRD compared to US-born White older adults after adjusting for age and sex. After additional adjustment for education, health insurance, usual source of care, and chronic conditions, only US-born Black older adults continued to show higher odds (OR = 1.54; 95% CI = 1.27-1.87) of diagnosed ADRD compared to US-born White older adults. There were no differences in ADRD diagnosis by nativity within each racial/ethnic group. Findings highlight the need for including nativity in studies comparing racial/ethnic groups to Whites to fully capture the ADRD burden among US-born Black older adults.
