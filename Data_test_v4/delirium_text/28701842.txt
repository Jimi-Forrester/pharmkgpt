28701842|t|Quality of Dying in the Medical Intensive Care Unit: Comparison between Thai Buddhists and Thai Muslims.
28701842|a|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Religious belief is an important aspect that influences the life of a patient, especially in Asia. We aim to compare the quality of death in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) between Buddhists and Muslims from the perspectives of the relatives of the patients and the nurses and physicians. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This was a cohort study of critically ill patients who died after admission to a medical ICU in Songklanagarind Hospital in Thailand between 2015 and 2016. We interviewed by telephone the relatives of patients. The nurses and physicians who cared for the patients responded to a self-questionnaire. RESULTS: A total of 112 patients were enrolled in the study. The quality of death and dying-1 scores in Thai Buddhists and Muslim patients rated by the relatives (8 vs. 8, P = 0.55), nurses (8 vs. 8, P = 0.28), and physicians (7 vs. 7, P = 0.74) were not different. The ratings by the nurses correlated with the relatives (rs = 0.41, P < 0.001) but did not correlate with the physicians (rs = 0.15, P = 0.12). Compared with Buddhist patients, Muslim patients were more likely to have documentation in place at the time of the death of do not resuscitate (100% vs. 80.2%, P = 0.02) and withholding and withdrawing life support (100% vs. 80.2%, P = 0.02). CONCLUSION: There was no difference in the quality of dying and death between Thai Buddhists and Muslims. However, some elements of palliative care were not similar.
