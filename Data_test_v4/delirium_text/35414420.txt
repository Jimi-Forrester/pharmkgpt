35414420|a|White matter signal abnormalities (WMSA), either hypo- or hyperintensities in MRI imaging, are considered a proxy of cerebrovascular pathology and contribute to, and modulate, the clinical presentation of Alzheimer's disease (AD), with cognitive dysfunction being apparent at lower levels of amyloid and/or tau pathology when lesions are present. To what extent the topography of cortical thinning associated with AD may be explained by WMSA remains unclear. Cortical thickness group difference maps and subgroup analyses show that the effect of WMSA on cortical thickness in cognitively normal participants has a higher overlap with the canonical pattern of AD, compared to AD participants. (Age and sex-matched group of 119 NC (AV45 PET negative, CDR = 0) versus 119 participants with AD (AV45 PET-positive, CDR > 0.5). The canonical patterns of cortical atrophy thought to be specific to Alzheimer's disease are strongly linked to cerebrovascular pathology supporting a reinterpretation of the classical models of AD suggesting that a part of the typical AD pattern is due to co-localized cortical loss before the onset of AD.
