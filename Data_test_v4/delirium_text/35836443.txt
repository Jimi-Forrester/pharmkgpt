35836443|t|Compulsive Sexual Behavior and Alcohol Use Disorder Treated With Naltrexone: A Case Report and Literature Review.
35836443|a|Compulsive sexual behavior (CSB) or sexual addiction is a term that generally indicates excessive and uncontrolled sexual behavior. This may lead to subjective distress, social and occupational impairment, or legal and financial consequences. Often, this condition is underreported and untreated. Until now there are no FDA-approved medications for sexual addiction or compulsive sexual behaviors. However, the therapeutic benefits of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and naltrexone are known. This is a case of a 53-year-old male with a history of extensive alcohol use, alcohol withdrawal seizure, and delirium tremens. The patient was treated with naltrexone 50 mg/day for alcohol use disorder. The patient reported that his "sexual compulsion" also reduced after the medication and there was an improvement in both alcohol addiction and self-reported compulsive sexual behavior. This case report also includes a literature review of pharmacotherapy, especially naltrexone, for the treatment of sexual addiction/compulsive sexual behavior. The literature review has shown that patients' symptoms were improved in different doses without side effects, and based on this and our experience, it can be said that naltrexone is effective in the reduction and remission of the symptoms of CSB or sexual addiction.
