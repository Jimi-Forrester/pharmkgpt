11060507|t|Apolipoprotein E phenotype alone does not influence survival in Alzheimer's disease: a population-based longitudinal study.
11060507|a|Apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4) phenotype is a known risk factor for development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Contradictory results exist concerning the role of ApoE4 in the rate of decline and mortality in AD. Conflicting findings have also been reported about ApoE and gender interactions with respect to survival. We examined the survival of subjects with AD and non-AD controls with respect to ApoE phenotype and gender in a population-based longitudinal study. Cognitive evaluation was performed for a total of 980 subjects (then aged 69-78 years), and 48 cases with AD were identified. ApoE4 phenotype was more frequently present among subjects with AD. In the whole study population, survival was not related to the presence of AD or ApoE4 phenotype. Risk of death was increased for men compared to women, independently of the ApoE4 phenotype (HR 0.5, 95% confidence interval 0.44-0.69). In subjects with AD, the presence of ApoE4 alone did not influence survival. However, in the AD group, ApoE4-negative men had significantly increased risk of mortality compared to the risk in ApoE4-negative women (p < 0.01). We conclude that the presence of ApoE4 phenotype or AD did not influence mortality in the aged population. Once AD had become manifest, ApoE4 alone did not relate to survival. However, in subjects with AD not carrying ApoE4, men had reduced survival compared to women.
