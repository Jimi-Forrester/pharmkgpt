36672051|a|Background: Subthalamic nucleus (STN) deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an effective method for treating Parkinson's disease (PD). However, safety of STN-DBS treating PD patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) comorbidity is rarely focused and reported. The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of STN-DBS treating PD patients with CVD comorbidity. Methods: We retrospectively included PD patients with CVD comorbidity who underwent STN-DBS under general anesthesia in our center from January 2019 to January 2021. Patient's PD symptoms and cardiopulmonary function were evaluated by a multi-disciplinary team (MDT) before surgery. Post-operative clinical outcome and complications were collected until 1-year follow-up. Results: A total of 38 patients (26 men/12 women) of mean body mass index (BMI) 24.36 +- 3.11 kg/m2, with different CVD comorbidity were finally speculated in the study. These CVD include mainly hypertension, coronary artery disease, thoracic aortic aneurysm, heart valve replacement, pacemaker implantation, atrial fibrillation, patent foramen ovale, and so on. The mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 38 patients at admission day, pre-operation day, and discharge day timepoint was 135.63 +- 18.08 mmHg, 137.66 +- 12.26 mmHg, and 126.87 +- 13.36 mmHg, respectively. This showed that blood pressure was controlled well under stable and normal state. The indicators of myocardial infarction Troponin T (Tn T-T) levels at pre-operation, 1 day and 7 days after operation timepoint were 0.014 +- 0.011 ng/mL, 0.015 +- 0.011 ng/mL, and 0.014 +- 0.008 ng/mL, showing no significant fluctuation (F = 0.038, p = 0.962). STN-DBS improved PD patients' UPDRS III scores by 51.38% (t = 12.33, p < 0.0001) at 1-year follow-up compared with pre-operative baseline. A total of 11 adverse events were recorded until 1-year follow-up. No obvious cardiovascular complications such as intracranial hematoma or clot-related events occurred within 1 year after surgery except 1 case of hematuria. Conclusions: STN-DBS under general anesthesia is safe and effective for treating PD patients with CVD comorbidity. Our clinical experience and protocol of the MDT offers comprehensive perioperative evaluation for DBS surgery and mitigates bleeding and cardiovascular-associated events in PD patients with CVD comorbidity.
