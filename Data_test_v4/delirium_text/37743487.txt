37743487|a|Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) is the most prevalent cause of spinal cord dysfunction in the aging population. Significant neurological deficits may result from a delayed diagnosis as well as inadequate neurological recovery following surgical decompression. Here, we review the pathophysiology of DCM with an emphasis on how blood-spinal cord barrier (BSCB) disruption is a critical yet neglected pathological feature affecting prognosis. In patients suffering from DCM, compromise of the BSCB is evidenced by elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to serum protein ratios and abnormal contrast-enhancement upon magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In animal model correlates, there is histological evidence of increased extravasation of tissue dyes and serum contents, and pathological changes to the neurovascular unit. BSCB dysfunction is the likely culprit for ischemia-reperfusion injury following surgical decompression, which can result in devastating neurological sequelae. As there are currently no therapeutic approaches specifically targeting BSCB reconstitution, we conclude the review by discussing potential interventions harnessed for this purpose.
