38418620|t|The therapeutic effect of mesenchymal stem cells in diabetic kidney disease.
38418620|a|Diabetes mellitus (DM) often causes chronic kidney damage despite best medical practices. Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) arises from a complex interaction of factors within the kidney and the whole body. Targeting specific disease-causing agents using drugs has not been effective in treating DKD. However, stem cell therapies offer a promising alternative by addressing multiple disease pathways and promoting kidney regeneration. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) offer great promise due to their superior accessibility ratio from adult tissues and remarkable modes of action, such as the production of paracrine anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective substances. This review critically evaluates the development of MSC treatment for DKD as it moves closer to clinical application. Results from animal models suggest that systemic MSC infusion may positively impact DKD progression. However, few registered and completed clinical trials exist, and whether the treatments are effective in humans is still being determined. Significant knowledge gaps and research opportunities exist, including establishing the ideal source, dose, and timing of MSC delivery, better understanding of in vivo mechanisms, and developing quantitative indicators to obtain a more significant therapeutic response. This paper reviews recent literature on using MSCs in preclinical and clinical trials in DKD. Potent biomarkers related to DKD are also highlighted, which may help better understand MSCs' action in this disease progression. KEY MESSAGES: Mesenchymal stem cells have anti-inflammatory and paracrine effects in diabetic kidney disease. Mesenchymal stem cells alleviate in animal models having diabetic kidney disease. Mesenchymal stem cells possess promise for the treatment of diabetic kidney disease.
