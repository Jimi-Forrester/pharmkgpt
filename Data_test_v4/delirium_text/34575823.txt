34575823|t|14,15-EET Reduced Brain Injury from Cerebral Ischemia and Reperfusion via Suppressing Neuronal Parthanatos.
34575823|a|To investigate the effect of 14,15-EET on the parthanatos in neurons induced by cerebral ischemia and reperfusion, middle cerebral artery occlusion and reperfusion (MCAO/R) and oxygen glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) were used to simulate cerebral ischemia reperfusion in vivo and in vitro, respectively. TTC staining and the Tunel method were used to detect cerebral infarct volume and neuronal apoptosis. Western blot and immunofluorescence were used to detect poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) activation and AIF nuclear translocation. The production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the expression of antioxidant genes were detected by Mito SOX, DCFH-DA and qPCR methods. MCAO/R increased cerebral infarct volume and neuronal apoptosis in mice, while 14,15-EET pretreatment increased cerebral infarct volume and neuronal apoptosis. OGD/R induced reactive oxygen species generation, PARP-1 cleavage, and AIF nuclear translocation in cortical neurons. 14,15-EET pretreatment could enhance the antioxidant gene expression of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in cortical neurons after ischemia and reperfusion. 14,15-EET inhibits the neuronal parthanatos induced by MCAO/R through upregulation of the expression of antioxidant genes and by reducing the generation of reactive oxygen species. This study advances the EET neuroprotection theory and provides a scientific basis for targeted clinical drugs that reduce neuronal parthanatos following cerebral ischemia and reperfusion.
