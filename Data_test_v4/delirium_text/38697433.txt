38697433|a|Amyloids, proteinous aggregates with beta-sheet-rich fibrils, are involved in several neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease; thus, their detection is critically important. The most common fluorescent dye for amyloid detection is thioflavin-T (ThT), which shows on/off fluorescence upon amyloid binding. We previously reported that an engineered globular protein with a flat beta-sheet, peptide self-assembly mimic (PSAM), can be used as an amyloid binding model. In this study, we further explored the residue-specific properties of ThT-binding to the flat beta-sheet by introducing systematic mutations. We found that site-specific mutations at the ThT-binding channel enhanced affinity. We also evaluated the binding of a ThT-based photocatalyst, which showed the photooxygenation activity on the amyloid fibril upon light radiation. Upon binding of the photocatalyst to the PSAM variant, singlet oxygen-generating activity was observed. The results of this study expand our understanding of the detailed binding mechanism of amyloid-specific molecules.
