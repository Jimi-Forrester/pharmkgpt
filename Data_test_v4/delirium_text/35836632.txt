35836632|t|Rare and Unusual Presentation as Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura in Scrub Typhus Complicated by Meningitis and Acute Kidney Injury.
35836632|a|Scrub typhus is a known etiology of acute febrile illness in tropical regions such as Asia-Pacific. Several such reports are from the Indian subcontinent with manifestations such as non-specific febrile illness or multiorgan dysfunction [Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), myocarditis, hepatitis, acute kidney injury, or meningoencephalitis]. We came across a case with a presentation as immune thrombocytopenic purpura complicated by meningitis and acute kidney injury secondary to scrub typhus. This combination of presentation is rare and demands meticulous clinical examination and targeted management toward scrub typhus.
