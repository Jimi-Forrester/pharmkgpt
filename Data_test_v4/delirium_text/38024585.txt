38024585|a|Alzheimer's disease is a neurocognitive disorder and one of the contributing factors to dementia. According to the World Health Organization, this disease has a sig-nificant impact on the global population's health, with the number of affected individuals steadily increasing each year. Amidst rapid technological development, the use of artificial intelligence has significantly expanded into the field of medical diagnostics, encompassing areas such as the analysis of medical images, drug development, design of personalized treatment plans, and disease prediction and treatment. Deep learning, which is an important branch in the field of artificial intelligence, is playing a key role in solving several medical challenges by providing important technical support for the early detection, diagnosis, and treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Given this context, this review aims to explore the differences between conventional methods and artificial intelligence techniques in Alzheimer's disease research. Additionally, it aims to summarize current non-invasive and portable techniques for detection of Alzheimer's disease, offering support and guidance for the future prediction and management of the disease.
