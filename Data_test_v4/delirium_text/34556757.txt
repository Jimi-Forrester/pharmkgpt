34556757|a|Catheter ablation is an important non-pharmacological intervention for atrial fibrillation (AF), but its effect on the incidence of asymptomatic cerebral emboli and long-term effects on cognitive function remain unknown. We prospectively enrolled 101 patients who underwent AF ablation. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (72 patients) and neuropsychological assessments (66 patients) were performed 1-3 days (baseline) and 6 months after ablation. Immediately after ablation, diffusion-weighted MRI and 3-dimensional double inversion recovery (3D-DIR) detected embolic microinfarctions in 63 patients (87.5%) and 62 patients (86.1%), respectively. After 6 months, DIR lesions disappeared in 41 patients. Microbleeds (MBs) increased by 17%, and 65% of the de novo MBs were exactly at the same location as the microinfarctions. Average Mini-Mental State Examination scores improved from 27.9 +- 2.4 to 28.5 +- 1.7 (p = 0.037), and detailed neuropsychological assessment scores showed improvement in memory, constructional, and frontal lobe functions. Ejection fraction, left atrial volume index and brain natriuretic peptide level improved from baseline to 3-6 months after ablation. Despite incidental microemboli, cognitive function was preserved 6 months after ablation.
