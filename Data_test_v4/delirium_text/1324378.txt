1324378|a|A 90-year-old man was admitted to our hospital because of the dyspnea on exertion and an abnormal shadow of the chest. The examinations revealed pulmonary adenocarcinoma (bronchioloalveolar cell type) of the left S3 with clinical classification of stage I. Spirometry showed severe obstructive lung dysfunction (VC 2.05 l, % VC 75.2%, FEV1.0 0.72 l, FEV1.0% 39.3%). Walking exercise in the ward and the stairs as well as instrumental physiotherapy (Triflow) partially improved his respiratory function. Left upper lobectomy and lymphnode dissection were performed. On the 3rd postoperative day the patient developed mild delirium which disappeared in a few days. He was discharged from the hospital 62 days after the operation.
