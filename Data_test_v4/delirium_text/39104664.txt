39104664|t|Multicenter Retrospective Review of Ketamine Use in Pediatric Intensive Care Units (Ketamine-PICU Study).
39104664|a|Objective: Describe continuous infusion (CI) ketamine practices in pediatric intensive care units (PICUs) and evaluate its effect on pain/sedation scores, exposure to analgesics/sedatives, and adverse effects (AEs). Methods: Multicenter, retrospective, observational study in children <18 years who received CI ketamine between 2014 and 2017. Time spent in goal pain/sedation score range and daily cumulative doses of analgesics/sedatives were compared from the 24 hours (H) prior to CI ketamine to the first 24H and 25-48H of the CI. Adverse effects were collected over the first 7 days of CI ketamine. Results: Twenty-four patients from 4 PICUs were included; median (IQR) age 7 (1-13.25) years, 54% female (n = 13), 92% intubated (n = 22), 25% on CI vasopressors (n = 6), and 33% on CI paralytics (n = 8). Ketamine indications were analgesia/sedation (n = 21, 87.5%) and status epilepticus (n = 3, 12.5%). Median starting dose was 0.5 (0.48-0.70) mg/kg/hr and continued for a median of 2.4 (1.3-4.4) days. There was a significant difference in mean proportion of time spent within goal pain score range (24H prior: 74% +- 14%, 0-24H: 85% +- 10%, and 25-48H: 72% +- 20%; p=0.014). A significant reduction in median morphine milligram equivalents (MME) was seen (24H prior: 58 (8-195) mg vs. 0-24H: 4 (0-69) mg and p=0.01), but this was not sustained (25-48H: 24 (2-246) mg and p=0.29). Common AEs were tachycardia (63%), hypotension (54%), secretions/suctioning (29%), and emergence reactions (13%). Conclusions: Ketamine CI improved time in goal pain score range and significantly reduced MME, but this was not sustained. Larger prospective studies are needed in the pediatric population.
