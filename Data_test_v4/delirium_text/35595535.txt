35595535|a|OBJECTIVE: The objective of this survey was to identify areas where doctors have divergent practices in pharmacological treatment for hyperactive delirium in terminally ill patients with cancer. METHODS: We conducted a survey of Japanese palliative care physicians and liaison psychiatrists. Inquiries were made regarding: (i) choice of drug class in the first-line treatment, (ii) administration methods of the first-line antipsychotic treatment, (iii) starting dose of antipsychotics in the first line treatment and maximum dose of antipsychotics in refractory delirium, and (iv) choice of treatment when the first-line haloperidol treatment failed. Respondents used a five-point Likert scale. RESULTS: Regarding choice of drug class in the first-line treatment, more doctors reported that they 'frequently' or 'very frequently' use antipsychotics only than antipsychotics and benzodiazepine (oral: 73.4 vs. 12.2%; injection: 61.3 vs. 11.6%, respectively). Regarding administration methods of the first-line antipsychotic treatment, the percentage of doctors who reported that they used antipsychotics as needed and around the clock were 55.4 and 68.8% (oral), 49.2 and 45.4% (injection), respectively. There were different opinions on the maximum dose of antipsychotics in refractory delirium. Regarding the choice of treatment when the first-line haloperidol treatment failed, the percentage of doctors who reported that they increased the dose of haloperidol, used haloperidol and benzodiazepines, and switched to chlorpromazine were 47.0, 32.1 and 16.4%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Doctors have divergent practices in administration methods of the first-line antipsychotic treatment, maximum dose of antipsychotics, and choice of treatment when the first-line haloperidol treatment failed. Further studies are needed to determine the optimal treatment.
