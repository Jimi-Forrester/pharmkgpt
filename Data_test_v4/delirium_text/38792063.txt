38792063|t|Discovery of a New Polymorph of 5-Methoxy-1H-Indole-2-Carboxylic Acid: Characterization by X-ray Diffraction, Infrared Spectroscopy, and DFT Calculations.
38792063|a|This study presents a new 5-methoxy-1H-indole-2-carboxylic acid (MI2CA) polymorph investigated by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy, and density functional theory (omegaB97X-D) calculations employing two basis sets (6-31++G(d,p) and aug-cc-pVTZ). The compound crystallizes in the monoclinic system, space group P21/c (a = 4.0305(2) A, b = 13.0346(6) A, c = 17.2042(9) A, beta = 91.871(5) , Z = 4). In the crystalline structure, the formation of cyclic dimers via double hydrogen bonds O-H O between MI2CA molecules was observed. Interactions between the NH groups of the indole rings and the adjacent methoxy groups, as well as C-H O contacts, significantly influence the spatial arrangement of molecules. The results from DFT calculations, including dimeric and trimeric structures, agree well with the experimental structural and spectroscopic data. Analysis of the infrared spectra confirms the conclusions drawn from X-ray diffraction studies and reveals differences between the IR spectra of the newly obtained polymorph and that reported earlier in the literature. This comprehensive study sheds some light on the MI2CA polymorphism and is important for a potential pharmacological applications of this compound.
