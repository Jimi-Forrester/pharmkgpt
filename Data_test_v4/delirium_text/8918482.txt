8918482|t|Managed care: new challenges, new roles for the primary care physician. 2.
8918482|a|Managed care is revolutionizing health care, according to panelists in this roundtable discussion. Primary care physicians need to see patient care not as episodic but as a total, preventive package. In managed care, physicians hire nonphysician extenders for patient screening and function as a manager and consultant to an interdisciplinary team that extends beyond the four walls of the office practice. Patients need to know that primary care physicians can handle most of their problems; the specialist should be referred cases that are complicated and require procedures or second opinions. Outcome studies in managed care are lacking in important areas of geriatric medicine, such as treatment of psychiatric illnesses and Alzheimer's disease.
