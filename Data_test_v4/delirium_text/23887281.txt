23887281|a|The relationship between the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) epsilon4 genotype and an increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been well established in Caucasians but is less established among other ethnicities. ApoE epsilon4 has also been associated with several other neurological disorders. Whether ApoEpsilon4 epsilon4 is a risk factor for frontotemporal dementia (FTD) remains controversial. This study examined 432 patients with AD, 62 with FTD, and 381 sex- and age-matched controls. The ApoE epsilon4 allele frequency was significantly increased among patients in the AD and FTD groups compared with controls. The frequency of the ApoEpsilon epsilon4 allele was 24.86% in late-onset AD (p < 0.01), 18.02% in early-onset AD (p < 0.01), 16.13% in FTD (p < 0.01), and 7.34% in controls. ApoEpsilon epsilon4 prevalence was similar in the FTD and AD groups. The present study suggests that the ApoE epsilon4 allele is a risk factor for both disorders.
