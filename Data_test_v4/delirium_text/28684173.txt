28684173|a|The quest to comprehend genetic, biological, and symptomatic heterogeneity underlying Alzheimer's disease (AD) requires a deep understanding of mechanisms affecting complex brain systems. Neuroimaging genetics is an emerging field that provides a powerful way to analyze and characterize intermediate biological phenotypes of AD. Here, we describe recent studies showing the differential effect of genetic risk factors for AD on brain functional connectivity in cognitively normal, preclinical, prodromal, and AD dementia individuals. Functional neuroimaging genetics holds particular promise for the characterization of preclinical populations; target populations for disease prevention and modification trials. To this end, we emphasize the need for a paradigm shift towards integrative disease modeling and neuroimaging biomarker-guided precision medicine for AD and other neurodegenerative diseases.
