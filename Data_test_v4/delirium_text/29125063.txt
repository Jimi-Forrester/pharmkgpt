29125063|a|Most diseases and disorders of the brain require long-term therapy and a constant supply of drugs. Implantable drug-delivery systems provide long-term, sustained drug delivery in the brain. The present review discusses different type of implantable systems such as solid implants, in situ forming implants, in situ forming microparticles, depot formulations, polymeric-lipid implants, sucrose acetate isobutyrate and N-stearoyl L-alanine methyl ester systems for continuous drug delivery into brain for various brain diseases including glioblastomas, medulloblastoma, epilepsy, stroke, schizophrenia and Alzheimer's diseases. Implantable neural probes and microelectrode array systems for brain are also discussed in brief.
