38316961|a|Thyroid cancer is a prevalent endocrine malignancy with increasing incidence in recent years. Although most thyroid cancers grow slowly, they can become refractory, leading to a high mortality rate once they exhibit recurrence, metastasis, resistance to radioiodine therapy, or a lack of differentiation. However, the mechanisms underlying these malignant characteristics remain unclear. Circular RNAs, a type of closed-loop non-coding RNAs, play multiple roles in cancer. Several studies have demonstrated that circular RNAs significantly influence the development of thyroid cancers. In this review, we summarize the circular RNAs identified in thyroid cancers over the past decade according to the hallmarks of cancer. We found that eight of the 14 hallmarks of thyroid cancers are regulated by circular RNAs, whereas the other six have not been reported to be correlated with circular RNAs. This review is expected to help us better understand the roles of circular RNAs in thyroid cancers and accelerate research on the mechanisms and cure strategies for thyroid cancers.
