28702178|t|The development prospection of HDAC inhibitors as a potential therapeutic direction in Alzheimer's disease.
28702178|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease, which is associated with learning and memory impairment in the elderly. Recent studies have found that treating AD in the way of chromatin remodeling via histone acetylation is a promising therapeutic regimen. In a number of recent studies, inhibitors of histone deacetylase (HDACs) have been found to be a novel promising therapeutic agents for neurological disorders, particularly for AD and other neurodegenerative diseases. Although HDAC inhibitors have the ability to ameliorate cognitive impairment, successful treatments in the classic AD animal model are rarely translated into clinical trials. As for the reduction of unwanted side effects, the development of HDAC inhibitors with increased isoform selectivity or seeking other directions is a key issue that needs to be addressed. The review focused on literatures on epigenetic mechanisms in recent years, especially on histone acetylation in terms of the enhancement of specificity, efficacy and avoiding side effects for treating AD.
