1906057|t|The postictal psychosis of epilepsy: investigation in two patients.
1906057|a|Patients with epilepsy have a higher incidence of psychosis. Epilepsy-related psychotic behaviors include a chronic interictal schizophreniform illness, an "alternating psychosis" which remits with seizure activity, and ictal or perictal psychotic behaviors. In addition, there is an uncommon and less understood psychosis characterized by brief psychotic episodes during the postictal period. This report describes two patients with postictal psychosis and correlates their behavior with the pattern of seizures, electroencephalographic discharges, and anticonvulsant and psychotropic medications. The findings suggest that postictal psychosis results from increased epileptiform activity and continued cerebral dysrhythmia, has a latency in onset and is not due to the immediate postictal delirium, and reflects an exacerbation of underlying psychopathological tendencies. This report further discusses the potential pathophysiological mechanisms and management of this disorder.
