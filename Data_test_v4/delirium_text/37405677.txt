37405677|t|Direct oral anticoagulants vs vitamin K antagonist on dementia risk in atrial fibrillation: systematic review with meta-analysis.
37405677|a|Oral anticoagulation significantly reduces the incidence of dementia in atrial fibrillation patients. However, this protective effect has not been compared between Direct Oral Anticoagulants (DOAC) and Vitamin K antagonists' anticoagulants (VKA). We conducted an electronic search for potentially eligible studies through the bibliographic databases MEDLINE, CENTRAL, ClinicalTrials.gov, EMBASE and Web of Science. The outcome of interest was dementia. Random-effects meta-analysis was performed. Nine observational studies were included and 1,175,609 atrial fibrillation patients were enrolled. DOAC therapy was associated with a significant reduction when compared with patients under VKA therapy (hazard ratio 0.89; 95% confidence interval 0.80-0.99). The grade of confidence of our results was very low due to the risk of bias. DOAC therapy is associated with a significant decrease in the risk of dementia when compared with VKA therapy. However, the low certainty of the evidence along with the paucityof clinical trials dedicated to answering this important question underscores a need for global clinical research initiatives.
