37144606|a|AIMS: This study aimed to investigate the causal interaction between significant sensorimotor network (SMN) regions and other brain regions in Parkinson's disease patients with drooling (droolers). METHODS: Twenty-one droolers, 22 PD patients without drooling (non-droolers), and 22 matched healthy controls underwent 3T-MRI resting-state scans. We performed independent component analysis and Granger causality analysis to determine whether significant SMN regions help predict other brain areas. Pearson's correlation was computed between imaging characteristics and clinical characteristics. ROC curves were plotted to assess the diagnostic performance of effective connectivity (EC). RESULTS: Compared with non-droolers and healthy controls, droolers showed abnormal EC of the right caudate nucleus (CAU.R) and right postcentral gyrus to extensive brain regions. In droolers, increased EC from the CAU.R to the right middle temporal gyrus was positively correlated with MDS-UPDRS, MDS-UPDRS II, NMSS, and HAMD scores; increased EC from the right inferior parietal lobe to CAU.R was positively correlated with MDS-UPDRS score. ROC curve analysis showed that these abnormal ECs are of great significance in diagnosing drooling in PD. CONCLUSION: This study identified that PD patients with drooling have abnormal EC in the cortico-limbic-striatal-cerebellar and cortio-cortical networks, which could be potential biomarkers for drooling in PD.
