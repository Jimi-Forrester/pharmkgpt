36795141|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease but still lacks a preclinical strategy to identify it. The diagnostic value of intestinal mucosal alpha-synuclein (alphaSyn) in PD has not drawn a uniform conclusion. The relationship between the alteration of intestinal mucosal alphaSyn expression and mucosal microbiota is unclear. Nineteen PD patients and twenty-two healthy controls were enrolled in our study from whom were collected, using gastrointestinal endoscopes, duodenal and sigmoid mucosal samples for biopsy. Multiplex immunohistochemistry was performed to detect total, phosphorylate, and oligomer alpha-synuclein. Next-generation 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing was applied for taxonomic analysis. The results implied that oligomer alpha-synuclein (OSyn) in sigmoid mucosa of PD patients was transferred from the intestinal epithelial cell membrane to the cytoplasm, acinar lumen, and stroma. Its distribution feature was significantly different between the two groups, especially the ratio of OSyn/alphaSyn. The microbiota composition in mucosa also differed. The relative abundances of Kiloniellales, Flavobacteriaceae, and CAG56 were lower, while those of Proteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, Burkholderiales, Burkholdriaceae, Oxalobacteraceae, Ralstonia, Massilla, and Lactoccus were higher in duodenal mucosa of PD patients. The relative abundances of Thermoactinomycetales and Thermoactinomycetaceae were lower, while those of Prevotellaceae and Bifidobacterium longum were higher in patients' sigmoid mucosa. Further, the OSyn/alphaSyn level was positively correlated with the relative abundances of Proteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, Burkholderiales, Pseudomonadales, Burkholderiaceae, and Ralstonia in the duodenal mucosa, while it was negatively correlated with the Chao1 index and observed operational taxonomic units of microbiota in sigmoid mucosa. The intestinal mucosal microbiota composition of PD patients altered with the relative abundances of proinflammatory bacteria in the duodenal mucosa increased. The ratio of the OSyn/alphaSyn level in the sigmoid mucosa indicated a potential diagnostic value for PD, which also correlated with mucosal microbiota diversity and composition. KEY POINTS:   The distribution of OSyn in sigmoid mucosa differed between PD patients and healthy controls.   Significant alterations in the microbiome were found in PD patients' gut mucosa.   OSyn/alphaSyn level in sigmoid mucosa indicated a potential diagnostic value for PD.
