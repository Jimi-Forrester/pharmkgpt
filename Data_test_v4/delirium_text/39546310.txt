39546310|a|Importance: Telehealth can expand access to care, but digital needs present barriers for some patients. Objective: To investigate sociodemographic and clinical associations of digital needs among veterans. Design, Setting, and Participants: This quality improvement study used data collected between July 2021 and September 2023 from Assessing Circumstances and Offering Resources for Needs (ACORN), a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) initiative to systematically screen for, comprehensively assess, and address social risks and social needs. Eligible participants were veterans screened for social risks and social needs during routine care at 12 outpatient clinics, 3 emergency departments, and 1 inpatient unit across 14 VA medical centers. Data analysis occurred between October 2023 and January 2024. Exposure: The ACORN screening tool was administered by clinical staff. Main Outcomes and Measures: Veterans were considered positive for a digital need if they reported no smartphone or computer, no access to affordable and reliable internet, running out of minutes and/or data before the end of the month, and/or requested help setting up a video telehealth visit. Results: Among 6419 veterans screened (mean [SD] age, 67.6 [15.9] years; 716 female [11.2%]; 1740 Black or African American [27.1%]; 202 Hispanic or Latino [3.1%]; 4125 White [64.3%]), 2740 (42.7%) reported 1 or more digital needs. Adjusting for sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, the adjusted prevalence (AP) of lacking a device among veterans aged 80 years or older was 30.8% (95% CI, 27.9%-33.7%), 17.9% (95% CI, 16.5%-19.2%) among veterans aged 65 to 79 years, 9.9% (95% CI, 8.2%-11.6%) among veterans aged 50 to 64 years, 3.4% (95% CI, 2.1%-4.6%) among veterans aged 18 to 49 years, 17.6% (95% CI, 16.7%-18.6%) for males, and 7.9% (95% CI, 5.5%-10.3%) for females. AP of lacking affordable or reliable internet was 25.3% (95% CI, 22.6%-27.9%) among veterans aged 80 years or older, 15.0% (95% CI, 12.1%-18.0%) among veterans aged 18 to 49 years, 31.1% (95% CI, 28.9%-33.4%) for Black or African American veterans, 32.1% (95% CI, 25.2%-39.0%) for veterans belonging to other racial groups (ie, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, as well as those with more than 1 race captured in their medical record), and 19.4% (95% CI, 18.2%-20.6%) for White veterans. Veterans with dementia were at higher risk of lacking a device (adjusted relative risk [aRR], 1.21; 95% CI, 1.00-1.48). Veterans with high medical complexity were at higher risk of lacking internet (aRR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.11-1.42). Veterans with dementia (aRR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.24-2.01) or substance use disorder (aRR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.00-1.49) were more likely to want help scheduling a telehealth visit than those without. Conclusions and Relevance: In this quality improvement study of veterans screened for social risks and social needs, there were substantial disparities in digital needs. These findings suggest that routine screening is important to understand patients' digital access barriers and connect patients with telehealth resources to address inequities in health care.
