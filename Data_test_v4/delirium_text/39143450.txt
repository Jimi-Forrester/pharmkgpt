39143450|t|Single-Cell Cortical Transcriptomics Reveals Common and Distinct Changes in Cell-Cell Communication in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Disease.
39143450|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) cause significant neuronal loss and severely impair daily living. Despite different clinical manifestations, these disorders share common pathological molecular hallmarks, including mitochondrial dysfunction and synaptic degeneration. A detailed comparison of molecular changes at single-cell resolution in the cortex, as one of the main brain regions affected in both disorders, may reveal common susceptibility factors and disease mechanisms. We performed single-cell transcriptomic analyses of post-mortem cortical tissue from AD and PD subjects and controls to identify common and distinct disease-associated changes in individual genes, cellular pathways, molecular networks, and cell-cell communication events, and to investigate common mechanisms. The results revealed significant disease-specific, shared, and opposing gene expression changes, including cell type-specific signatures for both diseases. Hypoxia signaling and lipid metabolism emerged as significantly modulated cellular processes in both AD and PD, with contrasting expression alterations between the two diseases. Furthermore, both pathway and cell-cell communication analyses highlighted shared significant alterations involving the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, which has been implicated in the inflammatory response in several neurodegenerative disorders. Overall, the analyses revealed common and distinct alterations in gene signatures, pathway activities, and gene regulatory subnetworks in AD and PD. The results provide insights into coordinated changes in pathway activity and cell-cell communication that may guide future diagnostics and therapeutics.
