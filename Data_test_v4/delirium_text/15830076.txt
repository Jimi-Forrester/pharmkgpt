15830076|a|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the presence and the level of awareness of disease in mild and moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHOD: Cross-sectional evaluation of patients with mild/moderate AD (n=42) assessed by Assessment of Psychosocial Impact of the Dementia Diagnosis (APSID), Mini-mental State Examination (MMSE) and Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR). RESULTS: Awareness of disease and its consequences were present in 66.7% patients with mild AD (n=18). In moderate AD (n=24), 20.8% presented total awareness, 45.8% presented only awareness of cognitive symptoms. Unawareness of disease was observed in 33.3%. CONCLUSIONS: The present data show association between awareness and level of severity of disease. CDR 1 patients show a better recognition of cognitive and daily life activity symptoms, whereas CDR 2 patients recognized their cognitive symptoms but failed to appraise their severity and consequences in daily life activities.
