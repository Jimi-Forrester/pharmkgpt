38915944|a|This review comprehensively assesses the epidemiology, interaction, and impact on patient outcomes of perioperative sleep disorders (SD) and perioperative neurocognitive disorders (PND) in the elderly. The incidence of SD and PND during the perioperative period in older adults is alarmingly high, with SD significantly contributing to the occurrence of postoperative delirium. However, the clinical evidence linking SD to PND remains insufficient, despite substantial preclinical data. Therefore, this study focuses on the underlying mechanisms between SD and PND, underscoring that potential mechanisms driving SD-induced PND include uncontrolled central nervous inflammation, blood-brain barrier disruption, circadian rhythm disturbances, glial cell dysfunction, neuronal and synaptic abnormalities, impaired central metabolic waste clearance, gut microbiome dysbiosis, hippocampal oxidative stress, and altered brain network connectivity. Additionally, the review also evaluates the effectiveness of various sleep interventions, both pharmacological and nonpharmacological, in mitigating PND. Strategies such as earplugs, eye masks, restoring circadian rhythms, physical exercise, noninvasive brain stimulation, dexmedetomidine, and melatonin receptor agonists have shown efficacy in reducing PND incidence. The impact of other sleep-improvement drugs (e.g., orexin receptor antagonists) and methods (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia) on PND is still unclear. However, certain drugs used for treating SD (e.g., antidepressants and first-generation antihistamines) may potentially aggravate PND. By providing valuable insights and references, this review aimed to enhance the understanding and management of PND in older adults based on SD.
