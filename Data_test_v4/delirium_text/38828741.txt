38828741|a|This study aimed to explore the active components and the effect of Hedyotis diffusa (HD) against Alzheimer's disease (AD) via network pharmacology, molecular docking, and experimental evaluations. We conducted a comprehensive screening process using the TCMSP, Swiss Target Prediction, and PharmMapper databases to identify the active components and their related targets in HD. In addition, we collected potential therapeutic targets of AD from the Gene Cards, Drugbank, and OMIM databases. Afterward, we utilized Cytoscape to establish both protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks and compound-target (C-T) networks. To gain further insights into the functional aspect, we performed GO and KEGG pathway analyses using the David database. Next, we employed Autodock vina to estimate the binding force between the components and the hub genes. To validate our network pharmacology findings, we conducted relevant experiments on Caenorhabditis elegans, further confirming the reliability of our results. Then a total of six active compounds and 149 therapeutic targets were detected. Through the analysis of the association between active compounds, therapeutic targets, and signaling pathways, it was observed that the therapeutic effect of HD primarily encompassed the inhibition of Abeta, suppression of AChE activity, and mitigating oxidative stress. Additionally, our investigation revealed that the key active compounds in HD primarily consisted of iridoids, which exhibited resistance against AD by acting on the Alzheimer's disease pathway and the AGE-RAGE signaling pathway in diabetic complications.
