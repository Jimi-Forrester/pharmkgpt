29377404|t|Sedation for magnetic resonance imaging using propofol with or without ketamine at induction in pediatrics-A prospective randomized double-blinded study.
29377404|a|INTRODUCTION: Deep sedation using propofol has become a standard technique in children. This double-blinded randomized clinical trial aims to compare the clinical effects of propofol-mono-sedation vs a combination of propofol and ketamine at induction and a reduced propofol infusion rate for maintenance in children undergoing diagnostic magnetic resonance imaging. METHODS: Children aged from 3 months to 10 years scheduled as outpatients for elective magnetic resonance imaging with deep sedation were included. They were randomized into 2 groups, receiving either 1 mg/kg ketamine at induction, then a propofol infusion rate of 5 mg/kg/h or a propofol infusion rate of 10 mg/kg/h without prior ketamine. Time to full recovery (modified Aldrete score = 10) was the primary outcome. Further outcomes were quality of induction, immobilization during image acquisition, recovery, postoperative nausea and vomiting, emergence delirium using the Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium scale, vital signs and adverse cardiorespiratory events. All patients and parents as well as anesthetists, imaging technicians, and postsedation personnel were blinded. Data are given as median (range). RESULTS: In total, 347 children aged 4.0 (0.25-10.9) years, weighing 15.6 (5.3-54) kg, ASA classification I, II, or III (141/188/18) were included. The ketamine-propofol group showed significantly shorter recovery times (38 (22-65) vs 54 (37-77) minutes; median difference 14 (95% CI: 8, 20) minutes; P < .001), better quality of induction, and higher blood pressure, but higher incidence of movement requiring additional sedative drugs. There were no significant differences in respiratory side effects, cardiovascular compromise, emergence delirium, or postoperative nausea and vomiting. CONCLUSION: Both sedation concepts proved to be reliable with a low incidence of side effects. Ketamine at induction with a reduced propofol infusion rate leads to faster postanesthetic recovery.
