37363407|a|"Long COVID" is a sustained symptom following infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). According to recent statistics, at least 65 million people have long COVID, which poses a long-term threat to human health. The pathogenic mechanisms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are complex and affect multiple organs and systems. Common symptoms include palpitations, breathing difficulties, attention and memory deficits, fatigue, anxiety, and depression. It is difficult to achieve satisfactory treatment effect with a single intervention. Currently, treatment strategies for long COVID are still in the exploratory stage, and there is an urgent need to find appropriate and effective methods for long COVID treatment. Traditional Chinese medicine is effective in treating the various phases of COVID-19. Previous studies have shown that acupoint stimulation therapy is effective in improving palpitations, dyspnea, cognitive impairment, anxiety, depression, and other symptoms in patients. According to previous studies, acupoint stimulation may improve various symptoms related to long COVID. This paper discusses the potential application value of acupoint stimulation in the treatment of long COVID-related symptoms, based on the common sequelae of various systems involved in long COVID, and the effect of acupoint stimulation in the treatment of similar symptoms and diseases in recent years.
