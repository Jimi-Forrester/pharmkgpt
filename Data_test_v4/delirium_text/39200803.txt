39200803|a|(1) Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a worldwide neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the buildup of abnormal proteins in the central nervous system and cognitive decline. Since no radical therapy exists, only symptomatic treatments alleviate symptoms temporarily. In this review, we will explore the latest advancements in precision medicine and biomarkers for AD, including their potential to revolutionize the way we diagnose and treat this devastating condition. (2) Methods: A literature search was performed combining the following Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms on PubMed: "Alzheimer's disease", "biomarkers", "APOE", "APP", "GWAS", "cerebrospinal fluid", "polygenic risk score", "Abeta42", "tauP-181", " p-tau217", "ptau231", "proteomics", "total tau protein", and "precision medicine" using Boolean operators. (3) Results: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous genetic variants associated with AD risk, while a transcriptomic analysis has revealed dysregulated gene expression patterns in the brains of individuals with AD. The proteomic and metabolomic profiling of biological fluids, such as blood, urine, and CSF, and neuroimaging biomarkers have also yielded potential biomarkers of AD that could be used for the early diagnosis and monitoring of disease progression. (4) Conclusion: By leveraging a combination of the above biomarkers, novel ultrasensitive immunoassays, mass spectrometry methods, and metabolomics, researchers are making significant strides towards personalized healthcare for individuals with AD.
