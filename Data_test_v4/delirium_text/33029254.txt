33029254|a|OBJECTIVES: Retina abnormalities are related to cognitive disorders in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Retinal amyloid beta (Abeta) can be labeled by curcumin. We measured Abeta content in the cerebrum and retina of APPswe/PS1dE9 (APP) transgenic mice with early age to investigate the correlation between cerebrum and retina. METHODS: APP mice and age-matched wild-type mice were investigated every month from age 2 months to 6 months to assess changes in Abeta content in the retina and cerebrum. At the beginning of each month, mice were fed a curcumin diet (50 mg/kg/day) for 7 consecutive days. The Abeta levels in the retina and cerebrum were measured by ELISAs. Correlations were identified between retinal and cerebral Abeta contents using Pearson's correlation. RESULTS: In the absence of curcumin, there was a significant correlation between Abeta contents in the retina and cerebrum of APP mice (r = 0.7291, P = 0.0014). With increasing age, Abeta-mediated degenerative change in the cerebrum (P < 0.001 in 5 months) and retina (P < 0.01 in 5 months) increased significantly. The inhibitory effect of curcumin on the Abeta level was significant in the cerebrum (P < 0.001) and retina (P < 0.01) of older APP mice in the early stage of life. CONCLUSION: We observed a significant correlation between the Abeta content in the retina and Abeta content in the cerebrum of APP mice. Our data suggest an appropriate time to measure retinal Abeta. Although curcumin can label Abeta in the retina, it also suppresses Abeta levels and weakens the degree of correlation between Abeta in cerebrum and retina tissues.
