9745640|t|A biopsychosocial perspective on behavior problems in Alzheimer's disease.
9745640|a|The challenges of managing behavior problems in persons with dementia require new models that support interdisciplinary approaches. The Ecosystemic Biopsychosocial Grid is presented as a systems approach to assessing and organizing care. It assesses both resources and barriers across 10 realms of daily experience and identifies approaches that can maximize the balance between the capacities of persons with dementia and the demands placed upon them by their environment. Issues specific to Alzheimer's disease are reviewed across the biopsychosocial continuum.
