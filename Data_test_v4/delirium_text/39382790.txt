39382790|t|Efficacy of Cariprazine in the Psychosis Spectrum: A Systematic Review and Network Meta-Analysis of Randomised Controlled Trials in Schizophrenia and Bipolar Disorder.
39382790|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Psychosis represents one of the most challenging clinical presentations in psychiatry. Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder may both present psychotic features, and cariprazine may offer improvement in the treatment and care of these conditions. Therefore, the objective of the current work was to synthesise results of efficacy for cariprazine in these disorders. METHODS: In total, five electronic databases were searched for randomized controlled trials enrolling patients across the psychosis spectrum, using the search term 'Cariprazine' (PubMed, Embase, clinicaltrials.gov, EUDRACT, Cochrane-last search January 2024). No filter or limits were employed. Effect sizes were extracted, by the mean difference in psychometric variables before and after the intervention (Clinical Global Impression Scale, Positive and Negative Symptom Scale, Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, Young Mania Rating Scale, Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale). RESULTS: In total, 12 studies enrolling either patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder were included (total n = 6477; n = 4814 patients treated with cariprazine, n = 1663 controls treated with placebo). Cariprazine was effective in reducing global clinical severity, and higher improvements were observed at increasing dosages (- 0.25 at <= 1.5 mg/day, - 0.45 at >= 3 mg/day). Cariprazine also effectively reduced psychotic total scores: - 6.74, [95% confidence interval (CI) - 8.31; - 5.17], depression: - 1.78, [95% CI - 2.54; - 1.02], mania: - 5.72, [95% CI - 6.95; - 4.49], and anxiety symptoms: - 1.24, [95% CI - 1.92; - 0.56]. CONCLUSIONS: Cariprazine was observed as efficacious across retrieved studies, offering a potential for tailored treatments across the psychosis spectrum. REGISTRATION NUMBER: https://osf.io/pmyhq .
