38062089|a|The gut-brain axis is a bidirectional communication system between the gut and central nervous system. Many host-related factors can affect gut microbiota, including oral bacteria, making the brain a vulnerable target via the gut-brain axis. Saliva contains a large number of oral bacteria, and periodontitis, a common oral disease, can change the composition of salivary microbiota. However, the role and mechanism of periodontitis salivary microbiota (PSM) on the gut-brain axis remain unclear. Herein, we investigated the nature and mechanisms of this relationship using the mice with dextran sulfate sodium salt (DSS)-induced anxiety-like behavior. Compared with healthy salivary microbiota, PSM worsened anxiety-like behavior; it significantly reduced the number of normal neurons and activated microglia in DSS mice. Antibiotic treatment eliminated the effect of PSM on anxiety-like behavior, and transplantation of fecal microbiota from PSM-gavaged mice exacerbated anxiety-like behavior. These observations indicated that the anxiety-exacerbating effect of PSM was dependent on the gut microbiota. Moreover, the PSM effect on anxiety-like behavior was not present in non-DSS mice, indicating that DSS treatment was a prerequisite for PSM to exacerbate anxiety. Mechanistically, PSM altered the histidine metabolism in both gut and brain metabolomics. Supplementation of histidine-related metabolites had a similar anxiety-exacerbating effect as that of PSM, suggesting that histidine metabolism may be a critical pathway in this process. Our results demonstrate that PSM can exacerbate colitis-induced anxiety-like behavior by directly affecting the host gut microbiota, emphasizing the importance of oral diseases in the gut-brain axis.
