37763074|t|Association of the APOE Gene Polymorphism with Depression in White Adults in the WHO "MONICA-Psychosocial" Program.
37763074|a|The APOE gene polymorphism is associated with the risk of the development of several neurological disorders. The aim of the study was to investigate the association of the APOE gene polymorphism with depression in the white adult population aged 25-64 years in Novosibirsk (Western Siberia). The third screening of the WHO program "MONICA-psychosocial" was conducted in 1994-1995. In total, 403 men (the average age was 34 +- 0.4 years, the response was 71%) and 531 women (the average age was 35 +- 0.4 years, the response was 72%) of the open population of residents aged 25-64 years of the Oktyabrsky district of Novosibirsk were examined. The "MONICA-MOPSY" psychosocial questionnaire was used to assess depression. A high level of depression was found in 12.8% of the population: in 8.9% of men and in 15.8% of women. The frequencies of APOE gene polymorphism genotypes epsilon2/3, epsilon2/4, epsilon3/3, epsilon3/4, and epsilon4/4 were 14.9%, 3.1%, 61.6%, 17.5%, and 2.9%, respectively. Carrying the epsilon3/4 genotype of the APOE gene increased the odds of developing major depression by 2.167 times (95% CI 1.100-4.266) compared to carrying the epsilon3/3 genotype of the APOE gene in people without depression (chi2 = 5.120 df = 1 p = 0.024). Carriers of the epsilon4 allele were 2.089 times (95% CI 1.160-3.761) more likely to have a high level of depression than those without this allele and no depression (chi2 = 6.148 df = 1 p = 0.013), and 2.049 times (95% CI 1.117-3.758) more likely to have a moderate level of depression than those without this allele (chi2 = 5.470 df = 1 p < 0.019). The epsilon4 allele of the APOE gene is associated with a high level of depression.
