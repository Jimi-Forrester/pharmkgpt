37374280|t|Does Sarcopenia Accompanying End-Stage Knee Osteoarthritis Affect the Outcomes following Total Knee Arthroplasty?
37374280|a|Background and Objectives: This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of sarcopenia in patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty (TKA) for advanced knee osteoarthritis (OA), and to assess whether sarcopenia accompanying OA affects patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) after TKA. We evaluated which predisposing factors could influence the development of sarcopenia in patients with advanced knee OA. Material and Methods: A total of 445 patients whose body composition, muscle strength, and physical performance could be measured before primary TKA were enrolled. Sarcopenia was defined according to the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia 2019 criteria. Patients were categorized into sarcopenia (S, n = 42) and non-sarcopenia groups (NS, n = 403). PROMs were investigated using the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index. Additionally, postoperative complications and predisposing factors for sarcopenia were evaluated. Results: The incidence of sarcopenia in the entire sample was 9.4%; the prevalence was higher in men (15.4%) than in women (8.7%), and significantly increased with advancing age (p < 0.001). At the six-month follow-up, PROMs in group S were significantly inferior to those in group NS, except for the pain score; however, at the 12-month follow-up, no significant difference was observed between the groups. Multivariate logistic regression indicated that age, body mass index (BMI), and a higher modified Charlson Comorbidity Index (mCCI) were predisposing factors for sarcopenia. Conclusions: A higher prevalence of sarcopenia was observed in men with progressive knee OA. Up to six months after primary TKA, PROMs in group S were inferior to those in group NS, except for the pain score; however, no significant difference was observed between the groups at 12 months. Age, BMI, and higher mCCI were predisposing factors for sarcopenia in patients with OA.
