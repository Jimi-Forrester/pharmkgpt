34070395|a|The nutritional hallmark of chronic critical illness (CCI) after sepsis is persistent inflammation, immunosuppression, and catabolism syndrome (PICS), which results in global resistance to the anabolic effect of nutritional supplements. This ultimately leaves these patients in a downward phenotypic spiral characterized by cachexia with profound weakness, decreased capacity for rehabilitation, and immunosuppression with the propensity for sepsis recidivism. The persistent catabolism is driven by a pathologic low-grade inflammation with the inability to return to homeostasis and by ongoing increased energy expenditure. Better critical care support systems and advances in technology have led to increased intensive care unit (ICU) survival, but CCI due to PICS with poor long-term outcomes has emerged as a frequent phenotype among ICU sepsis survivors. Unfortunately, therapies to mitigate or reverse PICS-CCI are limited, and recent evidence supports that these patients fail to respond to early ICU evidence-based nutrition protocols. A lack of randomized controlled trials has limited strong recommendations for nutrition adjuncts in these patients. However, based on experience in other conditions characterized by a similar phenotype, immunonutrients aimed at counteracting inflammation, immunosuppression, and catabolism may be important for improving outcomes in PICS-CCI patients. This manuscript intends to review several immunonutrients as adjunctive therapies in treating PICS-CCI.
