39479123|t|Effectiveness and Safety of Cholecystectomy Versus Percutaneous Cholecystostomy for Acute Cholecystitis in Older and High-Risk Surgical Patients: A Systematic Review.
39479123|a|Acute cholecystitis (AC) is a prevalent surgical emergency, particularly among elderly individuals who present with high perioperative risks. While early cholecystectomy (CCY) is the standard treatment, percutaneous cholecystostomy (PC) is proposed as an alternative for high-risk patients. This systematic review aims to evaluate the comparative safety and efficacy of CCY versus PC in managing AC among elderly and high-risk surgical patients. This review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A comprehensive search was conducted across multiple electronic databases, including PubMed/Medline, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), ScienceDirect, Europe PMC, ClinicalTrials.gov, and EBSCO Open Dissertations, from July 1 to 15, 2024. Studies published from January 2019 to July 15, 2024, were included if they focused on patients aged 65 and older or those classified as high-risk surgical candidates. The review encompassed 72,366 participants across 22 studies, predominantly observational. Key outcomes assessed included postoperative complications, readmission rates, recurrence of cholecystitis, and mortality rates. This study highlights the need for individualized treatment strategies for managing AC in elderly populations. While CCY remains the preferred approach when feasible, PC offers a critical alternative for high-risk patients. Future research is necessary to optimize outcomes for this vulnerable population.
