33923964|t|Phytochemical Analysis, Pharmacological and Safety Evaluations of Halophytic Plant, Salsola cyclophylla.
33923964|a|Salsola cyclophylla, an edible halophyte, is traditionally used for inflammation and pain. To confirm the claimed anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties, a detailed study on respective pharmacological actions was undertaken. The activities are contemplated to arise from its phytoconstituents. The LC-MS analysis of S. cyclophylla 95% aqueous-ethanolic extract revealed the presence of 52 compounds belonging to phenols, flavonoids, coumarins, and aliphatics class. A high concentration of Mn, Fe, and Zn was detected by atomic absorption spectroscopic analysis. The ethyl acetate extract showed the highest flavonoid contents (5.94 +- 0.04 mg/g, Quercetin Equivalents) and Fe2+-chelation (52%) potential with DPPH radicals-quenching IC50 at 1.35 +- 0.16 mg/mL, while the aqueous ethanolic extract exhibited maximum phenolics contents (136.08 +- 0.12 mg/g, gallic acid equivalents) with DPPH scavenging potential at IC50 0.615 +- 0.06 mg/mL. Aqueous ethanolic extract and standard quercetin DPPH radicals scavenging's were equal potent at 10 mg/mL concentrations. The aqueous ethanolic extract showed highest analgesic effect with pain reduction rates 89.86% (p = 0.03), 87.50% (p < 0.01), and 99.66% (p = 0.0004) after 60, 90, and 120 min, respectively. Additionally, aqueous ethanolic extract exhibited the highest anti-inflammation capacity at 41.07% (p < 0.0001), 34.51% (p < 0.0001), and 24.82% (p < 0.0001) after 2, 3, and 6 h of extract's administration, respectively. The phytochemical constituents, significant anti-oxidant potential, remarkable analgesic, and anti-inflammatory bioactivities of extracts supported the traditionally claimed anti-inflammatory and analgesic plant activities.
