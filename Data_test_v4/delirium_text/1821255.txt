1821255|t|Hallucinations and associated factors in Alzheimer's disease.
1821255|a|In a consecutive sample of 230 community-dwelling patients with probable Alzheimer's disease, a structured interview yielded evidence of current hallucinations in 29.1% and misperceptions in another 11.3%. Visual and auditory modalities were similarly represented in apparent hallucinations. Hallucinations prior to the current monitoring period were rare among patients with misperceptions or with no perceptual abnormality. The probability of hallucinations was associated with the severity of cognitive dysfunction, the degree of other behavioral disturbances, and the presence of extrapyramidal signs. A logistic regression model predicting hallucinations based on these diverse clinical features accurately classified 87.0% of the sample.
