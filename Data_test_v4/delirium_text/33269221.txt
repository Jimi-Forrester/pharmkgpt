AIM: To explore the prediction accuracy of sociodemographic factors, Parkinson's motor symptoms, Parkinson's non-motor symptoms, and rapid eye movement sleep disorder for diagnosing EOPD using PD multicenter registry data. METHODS: This study analyzed 342 Parkinson patients (66 EOPD patients and 276 PD patients with normal cognition), younger than 65 years. An EOPD prediction model was developed using a random forest algorithm and the accuracy of the developed model was compared with the naive Bayesian model and discriminant analysis. RESULTS: The overall accuracy of the random forest was 89.5%, and was higher than that of discriminant analysis (78.3%) and that of the naive Bayesian model (85.8%). In the random forest model, the Korean Mini Mental State Examination (K-MMSE) score, Korean Montreal Cognitive Assessment (K-MoCA), sum of boxes in Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR), global score of CDR, motor score of Untitled Parkinson's Disease Rating (UPDRS), and Korean Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (K-IADL) score were confirmed as the major variables with high weight for EOPD prediction. Among them, the K-MMSE score was the most important factor in the final model. CONCLUSION: It was found that Parkinson-related motor symptoms (e.g., motor score of UPDRS) and instrumental daily performance (e.g., K-IADL score) in addition to cognitive screening indicators (e.g., K-MMSE score and K-MoCA score) were predictors with high accuracy in EOPD prediction.
