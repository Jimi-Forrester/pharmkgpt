38123223|a|Objective: To analyze the complications related to deep brain stimulation(DBS) surgery in Parkinson's disease(PD) patients and to determine whether there is a learning curve effect in terms of complications. Methods: Retrospective analysis of the DBS surgical data of 822 PD patients performed by the same surgeon at the First Affiliated Hospital of the University of Science and Technology of China (Anhui Provincial Hospital) from December 2012 to December 2022. The complications related to DBS were evaluated and analyzed the complications of every 100 DBS surgery were further analyzed. Results: A total of 822 PD patients, 453 males and 369 females, aged 31-80 years old, were included. The minimum follow-up period after DBS surgery is 6 months. Surgical related complications occurred in 55 patients (6.69%), including 5 patients (0.61%) with slight bleeding around the electrode, 1 patient (0.12%) with cerebral infarction, 4 patients (0.49%) with postoperative epilepsy, 42 patients (5.11%) with postoperative delirium, 2 patients (0.24%) with respiratory distress, and 1 patient (0.12%) with acute cardiac insufficiency. There were 16 cases (1.94%) of hardware related complications in DBS, of which 4 cases (0.48%) had infection, 1 case (0.12%) had a broken angle at the connection between the pulse generator and the extension wire, 8 cases (0.97%) had an excessively tight extension wire, and 3 cases (0.36%) had an IPG bag hematoma. In the infected cases, 2 patients removed IPG and extension wires. There were 7 cases (0.85%) of stimulus related complications, including 4 cases (0.61%) with programmed sensory abnormalities, 1 case (0.12%) with postoperative abnormal movements and dance like movements, and 2 cases (0.24%) with psychiatric symptoms. A comprehensive analysis was conducted on the above complications, among which 8 cases (0.97%) were relatively serious complications. After active treatment, satisfactory results were achieved, and none of them affected the patient's DBS treatment effect and no patients died. For every 100 cases of DBS surgery complications were analyzed, the percentage of complications decreased significantly from 14.50% (58 cases) in the first 400 cases to 4.73% (20 cases) in the last 400 cases (P<0.001). Conclusion: DBS surgery is safe and has an acceptable low incidence of complications. The incidence of complications also decreases with the accumulation of experience, showing a learning curve effect.
