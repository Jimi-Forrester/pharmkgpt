10791835|a|Atrophy of the hippocampal formation, a region important for the acquisition of new declarative knowledge, has been well-documented in Alzheimer's disease (AD), although the relation of such atrophy to the extent of memory dysfunction in these patients has been less clear. In the present study, 18 patients with a clinical diagnosis of probable AD were studied with a high-resolution, quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocol, as well as the verbal and spatial versions of the Buschke controlled learning task. The volumes of the hippocampal formation and, as a control for generalized atrophy, parahippocampal gyrus and temporal neocortex were computed from gapless coronal slices taken perpendicular to the long axis of the hippocampus. To correct for individual differences in brain size, volumes of regions of interest were divided by total intracranial volume. Separate stepwise regression analyses (with age, right and left hippocampal, parahippocampal gyrus, and temporal lobe volumes as the independent variables) showed that left hippocampal volume was the best predictor of free recall and delayed free recall of verbal information (P = 0.0042 and P < 0.0001, respectively). Recall and delayed recall of the spatial location of verbal items were best predicted by right hippocampal volume (P = 0.0054 and P = 0.0118, respectively). Memory scores did not correlate either with parahippocampal gyrus or temporal lobe volume. Furthermore, the relation between hippocampal volume and memory function observed in cases with AD did not hold for healthy aged control subjects.
