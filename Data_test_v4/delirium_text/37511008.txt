37511008|a|The epsilon2 allele of apolipoprotein E (epsilon2) has neuroprotective effects against beta-amyloid (Abeta) pathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, its impact on the functional connectivity and hub efficiency in cognitively normal older adults (CN) with epsilon2 is unclear. We investigated the functional connectivity differences in the default mode network (DMN), salience network, and central executive network (CEN) between A-PET-negative (N = 29) and A-PET-positive (N = 15) CNs with epsilon2/epsilon2 or epsilon2/epsilon3 genotypes. The A-PET-positive CNs exhibited a lower anterior DMN functional connectivity, higher posterior DMN functional connectivity, and increased CEN functional connectivity compared to the A-PET-negative CNs. Cerebral Abeta retention was negatively correlated with anterior DMN functional connectivity and positively correlated with posterior DMN and anterior CEN functional connectivity. A graph theory analysis showed that the A-PET-positive CNs displayed a higher betweenness centrality in the middle frontal gyrus (left) and medial fronto-parietal regions (left). The betweenness centrality in the middle frontal gyrus (left) was positively correlated with Abeta retention. Our findings reveal a reversed anterior-posterior dissociation in the DMN functional connectivity and heightened CEN functional connectivity in A-PET-positive CNs with epsilon2. Hub efficiencies, measured by betweenness centrality, were increased in the DMN and CEN of the A-PET-positive CNs with epsilon2. These results suggest unique functional connectivity responses to Abeta pathology in CN individuals with epsilon2.
