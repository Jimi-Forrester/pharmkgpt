38111593|t|The relationship between burden and caregiver's sleep disturbances in dementia: a systematic review.
38111593|a|Caregivers of people living with dementia (PLwD) have a high burden degree that leads to health issues, including sleep. Objective: This study aimed to analyze the impacts of the caregiving burden on caregiver's sleep disturbances. Methods: This systematic review involved a qualitative analysis of publications on Web of Science and Pubmed/Medline databases published between February 2018 and August 2022. Results: A total of 27 studies were identified and analyzed. Caregiver's sleep presents impairments in sleep latency, sleep fragmentation, sleep duration, subjective sleep quality, daytime dysfunction, and insomnia. Caregiver's distress and depressive symptoms have a dual relationship with sleep problems. Conclusion: Sleep disturbances presented by caregivers are correlated with higher burden levels and lead to more vulnerability to psychiatric symptoms and health issues.
