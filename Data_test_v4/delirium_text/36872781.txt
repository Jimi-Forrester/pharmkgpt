36872781|a|BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests that APOE e4 carriers have worse memory performances compared to APOE e4 non-carriers in older adults and effects may vary by sex and age. Estimates of biological age, using DNA methylation age estimates may enhance understanding of the associations between sex and APOE e4 on cognition. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether associations between APOE e4 status and memory vary according to rates of biological aging, using a DNA methylation age biomarker, in older men and women without dementia. METHODS: Data were obtained from 1,771 adults enrolled in the 2016 wave of the Health and Retirement Study. A series of ANCOVAs were used to test the interaction effects of APOE e4 status and aging rates (defined as 1 standard deviation below (i.e., slow rate), or above (i.e., fast rate) their sex-specific mean rate of aging on a composite measure of verbal learning and memory. RESULTS: APOE e4 female carriers with slow rates of GrimAge had significantly better memory performances compared to fast and average aging APOE e4 female carriers. There was no effect of aging group rate on memory in the female non-carriers and no significant differences in memory according to age rate in either male APOE e4 carriers or non-carriers. CONCLUSION: Slower rates of aging in female APOE e4 carriers may buffer against the negative effects of the e4 allele on memory. However, longitudinal studies with larger sample sizes are needed to evaluate risk of dementia/memory impairment based on rates of aging in female APOE e4 carriers.
