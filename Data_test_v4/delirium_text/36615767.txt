36615767|a|The deposition of beta-amyloid (Abeta) in the brain leads to neurotoxic effects and subsequent Alzheimer's disease (AD). While AD is becoming more and more prevalent in modern society, therapeutic efforts targeting Abeta could be a promising solution. Currently, two natural products are reported to disintegrate preformed Abeta fibril in vitro. Meanwhile, the chemical driving force behind this phenomenon remains unknown. Taking cyanidin-3-O-glucoside (Cy-3G) as an example, here we studied its interaction with different Abeta polymorphs in silico. Negative charges on different Abeta polymorphs draw the interaction with the flavylium cation on Cy-3G. Our results show that Abeta in a single peptide form in solution exposed more hydrophobic solvent accessible surface area than its fibril structure (per protomer), and Cy-3G interacts more intensively with the single peptide form than fibril as indicated by more hydrogen bonding formed and more amino acid residues involved in their hydrophobic interactions. Thus, the single Abeta peptide aggregation into fibril and fibril dissociation into single peptide equilibrium could be disturbed by the preferential binding of Cy-3G to the monomeric Abeta peptide, which leads to the disassembly of the pathogenic Abeta fibril. This study offers a novel perspective of Cy-3G alleviated AD syndrome beyond its dogmatic antioxidant activity.
