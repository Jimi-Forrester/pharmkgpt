33931009|a|BACKGROUND: In mammals, there are two subtypes of Grb2-associated regulator of Erk/MAPK (GAREM), an adaptor protein that functions downstream of the cell growth factor receptor. GAREM1 is ubiquitously expressed, whereas GAREM2 is mainly expressed in the brain. However, the precise mechanism of the translocation of each GAREM subtype in growth factor-stimulated cells is still unclear. METHODS: In this study, immunofluorescence staining with specific antibodies against each GAREM subtype and time-lapse analysis using GFP fusion proteins were used to analyze the subcellular localization of each GAREM subtype in a cell growth stimulus-dependent manner. We also biochemically analyzed the correlation between its subcellular localization and tyrosine phosphorylation of GAREM2. RESULTS: We found that endogenously and exogenously expressed GAREM2 specifically aggregated and formed granules in NGF-stimulated PC-12 cells and in EGF-stimulated COS-7 cells. Based on the observed subcellular localizations of chimeric GAREM1 and GAREM2 proteins, a glycine-rich region, which is present only in GAREM2, is required for the observed granule formation. This region also regulates the degree of EGF-stimulation-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of GAREM2. CONCLUSIONS: Our results, showing that aggregation of GAREM2 in response to EGF stimulation is dependent on a glycine-rich region, suggest that GAREM2 aggregation may be involved in neurodegenerative diseases.
