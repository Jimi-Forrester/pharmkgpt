23413651|a|Delirium is a frequent medical problem in hospitalized patients and is often underdiagnosed in spite its high morbidity and mortality. Early diagnosis and treatment are mandatory. Amongst diagnostic instruments currently available, the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) appears to be the best bedside tool due to its performance and rapidity of use. An adaptation for intensive care patients, CAM-ICU, has also been validated.
