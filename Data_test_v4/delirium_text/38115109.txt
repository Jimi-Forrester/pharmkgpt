38115109|t|Spatio-temporal dynamics of microglia phenotype in human and murine cSVD: impact of acute and chronic hypertensive states.
38115109|a|Vascular risk factors such as chronic hypertension are well-established major modifiable factors for the development of cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD). In the present study, our focus was the investigation of cSVD-related phenotypic changes in microglia in human disease and in the spontaneously hypertensive stroke-prone rat (SHRSP) model of cSVD. Our examination of cortical microglia in human post-mortem cSVD cortical tissue revealed distinct morphological microglial features specific to cSVD. We identified enlarged somata, an increase in the territory occupied by thickened microglial processes, and an expansion in the number of vascular-associated microglia. In parallel, we characterized microglia in a rodent model of hypertensive cSVD along different durations of arterial hypertension, i.e., early chronic and late chronic hypertension. Microglial somata were already enlarged in early hypertension. In contrast, at late-stage chronic hypertension, they further exhibited elongated branches, thickened processes, and a reduced ramification index, mirroring the findings in human cSVD. An unbiased multidimensional flow cytometric analysis revealed phenotypic heterogeneity among microglia cells within the hippocampus and cortex. At early-stage hypertension, hippocampal microglia exhibited upregulated CD11b/c, P2Y12R, CD200R, and CD86 surface expression. Detailed analysis of cell subpopulations revealed a unique microglial subset expressing CD11b/c, CD163, and CD86 exclusively in early hypertension. Notably, even at early-stage hypertension, microglia displayed a higher association with cerebral blood vessels. We identified several profound clusters of microglia expressing distinct marker profiles at late chronic hypertensive states. In summary, our findings demonstrate a higher vulnerability of the hippocampus, stage-specific microglial signatures based on morphological features, and cell surface protein expression in response to chronic arterial hypertension. These results indicate the diversity within microglia sub-populations and implicate the subtle involvement of microglia in cSVD pathogenesis.
