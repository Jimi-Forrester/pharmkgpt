39460815|t|Tuning multispectral fluorescence quantum dot-based identification of short-length amyloid beta peptides by applying Cu(II) ions.
39460815|a|Currently available methods for detecting amyloid beta (Abeta) derivatives are mainly dedicated to determining the long forms Abeta1-42 and Abeta1-40. At the same time, the number of physiologically occurring Abeta analogs is much higher, including those truncated at the N- and C-termini. Their identification using standard methods is challenging due to the structural similarity of various Abeta analogs, but could highly benefit from both biomarkers discovery and pathophysiological studies of Alzheimer's disease. Therefore a "chemical tongue" sensing strategy was employed for the detection of seven Abeta peptide derivatives: Abeta1-16, Abeta4-16, Abeta4-9, Abeta5-16, Abeta5-12, Abeta5-9, Abeta12-16. The proposed sensing system is based on competitive interactions between quantum dots, Cu(II) ions, and Abeta peptides, providing unique fluorescence fingerprints useful for the identification of analytes. After carefully evaluating the Abeta sample preparation protocol, perfect determination of all studied Abeta peptides was achieved using partial least square-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). The developed PLS-DA models are characterized by excellent accuracy, sensitivity, precision, and specificity of analyte determination, emphasizing the potential of the proposed sensing strategy.
