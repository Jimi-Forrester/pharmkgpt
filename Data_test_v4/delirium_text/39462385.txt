39462385|t|Targeting sphingosine 1-phosphate and sphingosine kinases in pancreatic cancer: mechanisms and therapeutic potential.
39462385|a|Pancreatic cancer is known to be the most lethal cancer. Fewer new treatments are being developed for pancreatic cancer as compared to other cancers. The bioactive lipid S1P, which is mainly regulated by sphingosine kinase 1 (SK1) and sphingosine kinase 2 (SK2) enzymes, plays significant roles in pancreatic cancer initiation and exacerbation. S1P controls many signaling pathways to modulate the progression of pancreatic cancer through the G-coupled receptor S1PR1-5. Several papers reporting amelioration of pancreatic cancer via modulation of S1P levels or downstream signaling pathways have previously been published. In this paper, for the first time, we have reviewed the results of previous studies to understand how S1P and its receptors contribute to the development of pancreatic cancer, and whether S1P can be a therapeutic target. In addition, we have also reviewed papers dealing with the effects of SK1 and SK2, which are kinases that regulate the level of S1P, on the pathogenesis of pancreatic cancer. We have also listed available drugs that particularly focus on S1P, S1PRs, SK1, and SK2 for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. Through this review, we would like to suggest that the SK/S1P/S1PR signaling system can be an important target for treating pancreatic cancer, where a new treatment target is desperately warranted.
