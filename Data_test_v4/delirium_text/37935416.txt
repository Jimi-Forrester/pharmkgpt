37935416|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Social isolation is a risk factor for cognitive decline and dementia. We conducted a randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT) of enhanced social interactions, hypothesizing that conversational interactions can stimulate brain functions among socially isolated older adults without dementia. We report topline results of this multi-site RCT (Internet-based conversational engagement clinical trial [I-CONECT]; NCT02871921). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The experimental group received cognitively stimulating semi-structured conversations with trained interviewers via internet/webcam four times per week for six months (induction) and twice per week for an additional six months (maintenance). The experimental and control groups both received weekly 10-minute telephone check-ins. Protocol modifications were required due to the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: 186 participants were randomized. After the induction period, the experimental group had higher global cognitive test scores (Montreal Cognitive Assessment [primary outcome]; 1.75 points [p=0.03]. After induction, experimental group subjects with normal cognition had higher language-based executive function (semantic fluency test [secondary outcome]; 2.56 points [p=0.03]. At the end of the maintenance period, experimental group MCI subjects had higher encoding function (Craft Story immediate recall test [secondary outcome]; 2.19 points [p=0.04]. Measure of emotional well-being improved in both control and experimental groups. Resting-state functional MRI showed that the experimental group had increased connectivity within the dorsal attention network relative to the control group (p = 0.02), but the sample size was limited. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Providing frequent stimulating conversational interactions via the internet could be an effective home-based dementia risk reduction strategy against social isolation and cognitive decline.
