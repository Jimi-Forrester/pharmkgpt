39548290|t|Targeting chaperone-mediated autophagy in neurodegenerative diseases: mechanisms and therapeutic potential.
39548290|a|The pathological hallmarks of various neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease prominently feature the accumulation of misfolded proteins and neuroinflammation. Chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) has emerged as a distinct autophagic process that coordinates the lysosomal degradation of specific proteins bearing the pentapeptide motif Lys-Phe-Glu-Arg-Gln (KFERQ), a recognition target for the cytosolic chaperone HSC70. Beyond its role in protein quality control, recent research underscores the intimate interplay between CMA and immune regulation in neurodegeneration. In this review, we illuminate the molecular mechanisms and regulatory pathways governing CMA. We further discuss the potential roles of CMA in maintaining neuronal proteostasis and modulating neuroinflammation mediated by glial cells. Finally, we summarize the recent advancements in CMA modulators, emphasizing the significance of activating CMA for the therapeutic intervention in neurodegenerative diseases.
