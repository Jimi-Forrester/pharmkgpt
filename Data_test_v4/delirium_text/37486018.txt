Human plasma contains lncRNAs that are present in the blood, and their disease-specific profile has been considered a potential biomarker in some diseases. METHODS: This study reports screening of the plasma levels of lncRNAs between Alzheimer disease(AD) (n = 45) and matched healthy controls (n = 45). The plasma samples of 5 AD patients and 5 matched healthy controls were randomly selected for expression levels of lncRNAs using the TruSeq RNA Sample Prep Kit (Illumina). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and area under the curve (AUC) were used to study the potential of lncRNAs as biomarkers. RESULTS: The differential expression profiles of plasma showed that 514 lncRNAs were upregulated, whereas 499 lncRNAs were downregulated.We found that the lncRNAs AL133415.1, AC020916.1, ENST00000654948, ASMTL-AS, AC005730.3, and AP001363.1 levels in the plasma of the AD patients were significantly lower compared to the control group (p1 = 0.0006, p2 < 0.001, p3 < 0.001, p4 = 0.039, p5 = 0.006, p6 < 0.001, respectively). ROC curve analysis revealed that the AUC of AL133415.1 was 0.635 (95% CI]: 0.507-0.763, p = 0.036), the AUC of ASMTL-AS1 was 0.658 (95% CI: 0.513-0.785, p = 0.015), the AUC of AC005730.3 was 0.627 (95%CI: 0.498-0.756, p = 0.049), and the AUC of AP001363.1 was 0.708 (95%CI: 0.595-0.822, p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: This study indicated that the plasma levels of the lncRNAs ASMTL-AS1, AP001363.1, AC005730.3, and AL133415.1 might be considered potential biomarkers for AD in the Chinese Population.
