38073897|a|BACKGROUND: Perioperative hypothermia (PH) negatively affects the physical and mental health of patients to varying degrees. Currently, there is no effective multidisciplinary team (MDT) intervention for gynecological patients with PH. AIM: To apply the best evidence on the prevention and management of PH in gynecological patients, improve the quality of perioperative evidence-based care based on treatment by an MDT for gynecological patients and analyze the effect of MDT- and evidence-based practice (EBP) projects on the psychological status and cognitive function of gynecological patients with PH. METHODS: Under the guidance of knowledge translation and combined with the opinions of involved stakeholders and clinical experts, the best evidence for PH prevention and management in gynecological patients was selected and adjusted to suit the practice setting. Based on the evidence, the practice plan was developed, and the MDT intervention was carried out in the preoperative ward, the preoperative preparation room, the intraoperative operating room, the postanesthesia care unit, and the 24-hour postoperative gynecological ward through the EBP program. The incidence of hypothermia, the nurses' awareness, the implementation rate of examination indicators, and the thermal comfort level, psychological status and cognitive function of patients were compared before and after the implementation of the program. RESULTS: The incidence of PH in gynecological patients decreased from 43.33% to 13.33% after the implementation of the scheme. The implementation rate of examination indicators 6-10, 12, 14, 16-18, 21, and 22 reached 100%, and that of other indicators was above 90%, except for examination indicators 5 and 13, which was 66.67%; the indices were significantly improved compared with the baseline (before evidence application) (P < 0.05). The score of nurses' awareness of PH prevention and management in gynecological patients increased from 60.96 +- 9.70 to 88.08 +- 8.96, and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.001). The total score of the perioperative thermal comfort level of patients undergoing gynecological surgery was 27.97 +- 2.04, which was significantly increased compared with the score of 21.27 +- 1.57 observed by researchers at baseline (P < 0.001). The perioperative Hamilton Depression Scale and Hamilton Anxiety Scale scores of patients undergoing gynecological surgery decreased from 15.03 +- 3.16 and 13.93 +- 2.64 to 4.30 +- 1.15 and 3.53 +- 0.78, respectively, with statistically significant differences (P < 0.001). The perioperative Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale score of the gynecological surgery patients increased from 23.17 +- 1.68 to 26.93 +- 1.11, also with statistical significance (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: MDT-based EBP for PH prevention and management in gynecological patients during the perioperative period can standardize nursing operations, improve nurses' awareness and behavioral compliance with gynecological hypothermia management, and reduce the occurrence of PH in gynecological patients while playing a positive role in reducing patients' negative emotions and enhancing their cognitive function.
