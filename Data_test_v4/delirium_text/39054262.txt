Treadmill exercise has proven beneficial for memory by enhancing synaptic plasticity in animal models including stroke, dementia, and mental disorders. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of treadmill exercise on recognition memory and structural synaptic plasticity in VD rat model. METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned into four groups: control group (C group, n = 6), vascular dementia group (VD group, n = 6), treadmill exercise and vascular dementia group (Exe-VD group, n = 6), and treadmill exercise group (Exe group, n = 6). Four-week treadmill exercise was performed in the Exe-VD and Exe groups. Then, the common carotid arteries of rats in the VD and Exe-VD groups were identified to establish the VD model. Behavior tests (open-field test and novel recognition memory test) were adopted to evaluate anxiety-like behavior and recognition memory. Transmission electron microscopy and Golgi staining were performed to observe synaptic ultrastructure and spine density in the hippocampus. RESULTS: Our study demonstrated that VD rat exhibited significantly anxiety-like behavior and recognition impairment (p < .01), while treadmill exercise significantly alleviated anxiety-like behavior and improved recognition memory in VD rat (p < .01). Transmission electron microscopy revealed that hippocampal synapse numbers were significantly decreased in the VD group compared to the control group (p < .05). These alterations were reversed by treadmill exercise, and the rats exhibited healthier synaptic ultrastructure, including significantly increased synapse (p < .05). Meanwhile, golgi staining revealed that the spine numbers of the hippocampus were significantly decreased in the VD group compared to the control group (p < .05). When compared with the VD group, hippocampal spine numbers were significantly increased in the Exe-VD group (p < .05). CONCLUSION: The improvement of VD-associated recognition memory by treadmill exercises is associated with enhanced structural synaptic plasticity in VD rat model.
