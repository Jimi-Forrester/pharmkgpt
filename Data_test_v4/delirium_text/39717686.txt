39717686|t|Irritability in stroke: a protocol for a prospective study.
39717686|a|Background: Poststroke irritability (PSI) is common among stroke survivors and can lead to a poor quality of life, difficulties in social interactions, criticism from caregivers, and caregiver stress. The planned study will evaluate the clinical, neuropsychological, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) correlates of PSI in a cohort of stroke survivors. In addition, the study will examine the 15-month progression of PSI. Methods: This will be a prospective cohort study that will recruit 285 participants. Participants and their caregivers will undergo detailed assessments at a research clinic at 3, 9, and 15 months after stroke onset (T1/T2/T3). The irritability/lability subscale of the Chinese version of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (CNPI) will be completed by caregivers. Potential covariates will also be measured. Patients will undergo MRI, including diffusion-weighted imaging, within 1 week of stroke onset. A stepwise logistic regression will be performed to evaluate the importance of lesions in the regions of interest (ROIs) along with other significant variables identified in univariate analyses. These analyses will be repeated for patients with and without PSI at T2 and T3. Repeated measures analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will be used to assess changes in CNPI scores for the entire sample. In ANCOVA analyses, the frequency of infarcts in the ROIs will be treated as the predictor. Discussion: This will be the first MRI study on PSI in stroke survivors. The findings will provide insights into the association of the orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, anterior temporal lobe, insula, amygdala, thalamus, and basal ganglia lesions with the risk of PSI.
