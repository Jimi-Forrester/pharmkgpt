33157962|a|Parkinsonian syndromes include typical cases of idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) and atypical parkinsonian syndromes (APS) associated with cognitive and vegetative disorders, which are more challenging to diagnose. The aim of this study was to assess -the value of dual-tracer imaging 6-fluoro-(18F)-L-DOPA (FDOPA) and fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT), performed in routine patients demonstrating extrapyramidal signs and cognitive complains, for the diagnosis and management of parkinsonian syndromes.We retrospectively included 143 consecutive patients who underwent both FDOPA PET/CT (for the evaluation of parkinsonism) and FDG PET/CT (for the evaluation of cognitive complaints) in the same institution. The suspected clinical diagnosis before imaging and the final post-imaging diagnosis were collected by a dedicated questionnaire.FDOPA was pathological in 90.2% of cases, including 74.1% of PD, 3.5% of parkinsonian dementia and 7% of APS. FDG was normal or near normal in 58.7% of patients. A pattern of diffuse cortical hypometabolism was observed in the remaining patients, more frequently in APS than in PD patients (P = .001). Importantly, in 7.7% of cases dual-tracer PET/CT allowed to decide between several diagnostic hypotheses and led to a new diagnosis in 14.0%. Therefore, the management of these patients was modified, with clinical re-evaluation in a specialized unit and a control of neuropsychological tests and imaging.Dual-tracer PET/CT imaging may be a precious help in the diagnosis and management of parkinsonian syndromes.
