34319460|t|Neuropathology of multiple system atrophy: Kurt Jellinger`s legacy.
34319460|a|Multiple System Atrophy (MSA) is a rare, fatal neurodegenerative disorder. Its etiology and exact pathogenesis still remain poorly understood and currently no disease-modifying therapy is available to halt or slow down this detrimental neurodegenerative process. Hallmarks of the disease are alpha-synuclein rich glial cytoplasmic inclusions (GCIs). Neuropathologically, various degrees of striatonigral degeneration (SND) and olivopontocerebellar atrophy (OPCA) can be observed. Since the original descriptions of this multifaceted disorder, several steps forward have been made to clarify its neuropathological hallmarks and key pathophysiological mechanisms. The Austrian neuropathologist Kurt Jellinger substantially contributed to the understanding of the underlying neuropathology of this disease, to its standardized assessment and to a broad systematical clinic-pathological correlation. On the occasion of his 90th birthday, we reviewed the current state of the art in the field of MSA neuropathology, highlighting Prof. Jellinger's substantial contribution.
