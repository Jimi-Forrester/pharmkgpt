38594662|t|Timing of early water intake post-general anaesthesia: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
38594662|a|BACKGROUND: Early water intake has gained widespread attention considering enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS). In the present systematic evaluation and meta-analysis, we assessed the effects of early water intake on the incidence of vomiting and aspiration in adult patients who received general anaesthesia on regaining consciousness during the resuscitation period. OBJECTIVE: To systematically analyse the results of randomised controlled trials on early postoperative water intake in patients who underwent different types of surgery under general anaesthesia, both at home and abroad, to further explore the safety and application of early water intake and provide an evidence-based foundation for clinical application. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: To perform the systematic evaluation and meta-analysis, we searched the Web of Science, CINAHL, Embase, PubMed, Cochrane Library, Sinomed, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang, and Vipshop databases to identify randomised controlled trial studies on early water intake in adult patients who received general anaesthesia. RESULTS: Herein, we included 10 publications with a total sample size of 5131 patients. Based on statistical analysis, there was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of vomiting (odds ratio [OR] = 0.81; 95% confidence interval [CI] [0.58-1.12]; p = 0.20; I-squared [I2] = 0%) and aspiration (OR = 0.78; 95%CI [0.45-1.37]; p = 0.40; I2 = 0%) between the two groups of patients on regaining consciousness post-general anaesthesia. CONCLUSION: Based on the available evidence, early water intake after regaining consciousness post-anaesthesia did not increase the incidence of adverse complications when compared with traditional postoperative water abstinence. Early water intake could effectively improve patient thirst and facilitate the recovery of gastrointestinal function.
