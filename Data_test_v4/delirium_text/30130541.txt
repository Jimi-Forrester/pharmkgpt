30130541|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Atractylodes macrocephala Koidz. (called Baizhu in China) is a medicinal plant that has long been used as a tonic agent in various ethno-medical systems in East Asia, especially in China, for the treatment of gastrointestinal dysfunction, cancer, osteoporosis, obesity, and fetal irritability. AIM OF THE REVIEW: This review aims to provide a systematic summary on the botany, traditional uses, phytochemistry, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and toxicology of A. macrocephala to explore the future therapeutic potential and scientific potential of this plant. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A literature search was performed on A. macrocephala using scientific databases including Web of Science, Google Scholar, Baidu Scholar, Springer, PubMed, SciFinder, and ScienceDirect. Information was also collected from classic books of Chinese herbal medicine, Ph.D. and M.Sc. dissertations, unpublished materials, and local conference papers on toxicology. Plant taxonomy was confirmed to the database "The Plant List" (www.theplantlist.org). RESULTS: More than 79 chemical compounds have been isolated from A. macrocephala, including sesquiterpenoids, triterpenoids, polyacetylenes, coumarins, phenylpropanoids, flavonoids and flavonoid glycosides, steroids, benzoquinones, and polysaccharides. Crude extracts and pure compounds of A. macrocephala are used to treat gastrointestinal hypofunction, cancer, arthritis, osteoporosis, splenic asthenia, abnormal fetal movement, Alzheimer disease, and obesity. These extracts have various pharmacological effects, including anti-tumor activity, anti-inflammatory activity, anti-aging activity, anti-oxidative activity, anti-osteoporotic activity, neuroprotective activity, and immunomodulatory activity, as well as improving gastrointestinal function and gonadal hormone regulation. CONCLUSIONS: A. macrocephala is a valuable traditional Chinese medicinal herb with multiple pharmacological activities. Pharmacological investigations support the traditional use of A. macrocephala, and may validate the folk medicinal use of A. macrocephala to treat many chronic diseases. The available literature shows that much of the activity of A. macrocephala can be attributed to sesquiterpenoids, polysaccharides and polyacetylenes. However, there is a need to further understand the molecular mechanisms and the structure-function relationship of these constituents, as well as their potential synergistic and antagonistic effects. Further research on the comprehensive evaluation of medicinal quality, the understanding of multi-target network pharmacology of A. macrocephala, as well as its long-term in vivo toxicity and clinical efficacy is recommended.
