28657029|a|Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) complicated with myeloperoxidase anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody (MPO-ANCA)-associated vasculitis is rare and generally has a serious prognosis. We report a case wherein TTP was successfully treated with repeated plasma exchange (PE) and MPO-ANCA-associated vasculitis with corticosteroids. The renal function consequently improved such that haemodialysis could be discontinued and the patient was discharged without any significant complications.
