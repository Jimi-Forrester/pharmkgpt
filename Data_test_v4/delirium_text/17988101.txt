17988101|a|A novel methodology for parallel liquid-phase synthesis of carbamates suitable for the preparation of sterically hindered molecules is disclosed. The alcohols are converted to 4-nitrophenylcarbonates, followed by the reaction with amines. Side product 4-nitrophenol and the unreacted excess amines are scavenged by appropriately chosen cleanup resins, selected among Amberlyst A26 (hydroxide form) and macroporous sulfonic acid (MP-TsOH) or polystyrene isocyanate (PS-NCO) and polystyrene benzaldehyde (PS-PhCHO) resins. As a part of a medicinal chemistry program directed toward finding gamma-secretase inhibitors as prospective drug candidates for Alzheimer's disease, a 6 x 24 library of carbamates was prepared. Out of 144 library members, 133 had a purity for the targeted compound of 80% or better. The prepared compounds were assessed in the gamma-secretase inhibition assay and demonstrated activity with IC 50 values in the range from 1 microM to 5 nM, with the activity of 7 compounds being better than 10 nM.
