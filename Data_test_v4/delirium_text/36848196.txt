36848196|a|ABSTRACT: Estrogen impacts neural development; meanwhile, it has a protective effect on the brain. Bisphenols, primarily bisphenol A (BPA), can exert estrogen-like or estrogen-interfering effects by binding with estrogen receptors. Extensive studies have suggested that neurobehavioral problems, such as anxiety and depression, can be caused by exposure to BPA during neural development. Increasing attention has been paid to the effects on learning and memory of BPA exposure at different developmental stages and in adulthood. Further research is required to elucidate whether BPA increases the risk of neurodegenerative diseases and the underlying mechanisms, as well as to assess whether BPA analogs, such as bisphenol S and bisphenol F, influence the nervous system.
