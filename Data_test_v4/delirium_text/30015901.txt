30015901|t|ROS-mediated autophagy through the AMPK signaling pathway protects INS-1 cells from human islet amyloid polypeptide-induced cytotoxicity.
30015901|a|Oligomerization of human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP) is toxic and contributes to progressive reduction of beta cell mass in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Autophagy is a highly conserved homeostatic mechanism in eukaryotes. Previous studies have confirmed that hIAPP can promote autophagy in beta cells, but the underlying molecular mechanism and cellular regulatory pathway of hIAPP-induced autophagy remains not fully elucidated. Accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) causes hIAPP induced-beta cell death. At present, little is known about the association between hIAPP-induced oxidative stress and autophagy in beta cells. Therefore, the present study investigated the underlying molecular mechanism and regulatory pathway of hIAPP-induced autophagy. Transmission electron microscopy was used to observe the number of autophagosome in cells. Cell viability was determined by an MTT test. A 2',7'-dichlorofluorescin diacetate assay was used to measure the relative levels of reactive ROS. Western blotting was used to detect expression of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and autophagic markers p62 and microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3. The results demonstrated that hIAPP induces autophagy through ROS-mediated AMPK signaling pathway in INS-1 cells. Upregulation of autophagy by AMPK activator 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide1-beta-D-ribofuranoside decreased ROS and malondialdehyde generation, whereas inhibition of autophagy by 3-methyladenine and AMPK inhibitor compound C aggravated hIAPP-induced oxidative stress and toxicity in INS-1 cells. Taken together, the present study suggested that hIAPP induces autophagy via a ROS-mediated AMPK signaling pathway. Furthermore, autophagy serves as a cell-protective mechanism against hIAPP-induced toxicity and chemical promotion of autophagy through AMPK signaling pathway attenuates hIAPP induced cytotoxicity and oxidative stress in INS-1 cells.
