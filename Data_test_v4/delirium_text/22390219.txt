22390219|a|The central nervous system (CNS) toxicity of fluoroquinolones is well known but usually occurs benign. In the literature, there are a few number of severe CNS toxicity cases related to fluoroquinolones. Levofloxacin is a third-generation fluorinated quinolone antibiotic, is the active levo stereoisomer of ofloxacin, and has one of the most favorable adverse reaction profiles. We describe a case of delirium associated with levofloxacin in a 55-year-old man who was hospitalized in our medical clinic for pneumonia.
