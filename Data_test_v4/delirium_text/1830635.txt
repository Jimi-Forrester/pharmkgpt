1830635|t|Characteristics of age-related language decline in adults with Down syndrome.
1830635|a|Age-related declines in language and other neuropsychological variables were examined in 60 adults with Down syndrome. Researchers have found that deterioration in functioning is present in most adults with Down syndrome if they live to be 35 years of age. Declines have typically been interpreted as symptoms of Alzheimer disease; however, the declines are not well-understood, and alternative explanations have been suggested. Our results showed significant relations between aging and language comprehension and aging and self-help skills. Verbal skills were not significantly related to aging and little variation occurred between the youngest and the oldest subjects. Guidelines for choosing appropriate criteria to examine the loss of language skills in this population were discussed.
