38154509|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Alzheimer's disease-related dementias (ADRD) are the primary public health concerns in the United States and around the globe. AD/ADRD are irreversible mental illnesses that primarily impair memory and thought processes and may lead to cognitive decline among older individuals. The prevalence of AD/ADRD is higher in Native Americans, followed by African Americans and Hispanics. Increasing evidence suggests that Hispanics are the fastest-growing ethnic population in the USA and worldwide. Hispanics develop clinical symptoms of AD/ADRD and other comorbidities nearly seven years earlier than non-Hispanic whites. The consequences of AD/ADRD can be challenging for patients, their families, and caregivers. There is a significant increase in the burden of illness, primarily affecting Hispanic/Latino families. This is partly due to their strong sense of duty towards family, and it is exacerbated by the inadequacy of healthcare and community services that are culturally and linguistically suitable and responsive to their needs. With an increasing age population, low socioeconomic status, low education, high genetic predisposition to age-related conditions, unique cultural habits, and social behaviors, Hispanic Americans face a higher risk of AD/ADRD than other racial/ethnic groups. Our article highlights the status of Hispanic older adults with AD/ADRD. We also discussed the intervention to improve the quality of life in Hispanic caregivers.
