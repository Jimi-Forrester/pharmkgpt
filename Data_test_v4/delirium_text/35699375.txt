35699375|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder whose main pathological hallmark is the accumulation of Amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) in the form of senile plaques. Abeta can cause neurodegeneration and disrupt cognitive functions by several mechanisms, including oxidative stress. ERp57 is a protein disulfide isomerase involved in the cellular stress response and known to be present in the cerebrospinal fluid of normal individuals as a complex with Abeta peptides, suggesting that it may be a carrier protein which prevents aggregation of Abeta. Although several studies show ERp57 involvement in neurodegenerative diseases, no clear mechanism of action has been identified thus far. In this work, we gain insights into the interaction of Abeta with ERp57, with a special focus on the contribution of ERp57 to the defense system of the cell. Here, we show that recombinant ERp57 directly interacts with the Abeta25-35 fragment in vitro with high affinity via two in silico-predicted main sites of interaction. Furthermore, we used human neuroblastoma cells to show that short-term Abeta25-35 treatment induces ERp57 decrease in intracellular protein levels, different intracellular localization, and ERp57 secretion in the cultured medium. Finally, we demonstrate that recombinant ERp57 counteracts the toxic effects of Abeta25-35 and restores cellular viability, by preventing Abeta25-35 aggregation. Overall, the present study shows that extracellular ERp57 can exert a protective effect from Abeta toxicity and highlights it as a possible therapeutic tool in the treatment of AD.
