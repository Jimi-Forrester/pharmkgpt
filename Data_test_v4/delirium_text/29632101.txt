29632101|t|Vascular Function Is Improved After an Environmental Enrichment Program: The Train the Brain-Mind the Vessel Study.
29632101|a|Environmental enrichment may slow cognitive decay possibly acting through an improvement in vascular function. Aim of the study was to assess the effects of a 7-month cognitive, social, and physical training program on cognitive and vascular function in patients with mild cognitive impairment. In a single-center, randomized, parallel-group study, 113 patients (age, 65-89 years) were randomized to multidomain training (n=55) or usual care (n=58). All participants underwent neuropsychological tests and vascular evaluation, including brachial artery flow-mediated dilation, carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity, carotid distensibility, and assessment of circulating hematopoietic CD34+ and endothelial progenitor cells. At study entry, an age-matched control group (n=45) was also studied. Compared with controls, patients had at study entry a reduced flow-mediated dilation (2.97+-2.14% versus 3.73+-2.06%; P=0.03) and hyperemic stimulus (shear rate area under the curve, 19.1+-15.7 versus 25.7+-15.1x10-3; P=0.009); only the latter remained significant after adjustment for confounders (P=0.03). Training improved Alzheimer disease assessment scale cognitive (training, 14.0+-4.8 to 13.1+-5.5; nontraining, 12.1+-3.9 to 13.2+-4.8; P for interaction visitxtraining=0.02), flow-mediated dilation (2.82+-2.19% to 3.40+-1.81%, 3.05+-2.08% to 2.24+-1.59%; P=0.006; P=0.023 after adjustment for diameter and shear rate area under the curve), and circulating hematopoietic CD34+ cells and prevented the decline in carotid distensibility (18.4+-5.3 to 20.0+-6.6, 23.9+-11.0 to 19.5+-7.1 Pa-1; P=0.005). The only clinical predictor of improvement of cognitive function after training was established hypertension. There was no correlation between changes in measures of cognitive and vascular function. In conclusion, a multidomain training program slows cognitive decline, especially in hypertensive individuals. This effect is accompanied by improved systemic endothelial function, mobilization of progenitor CD34+ cells, and preserved carotid distensibility.
