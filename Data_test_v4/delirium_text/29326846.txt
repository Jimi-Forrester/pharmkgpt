29326846|t|The Protective Effect of Sesamol in the Selenite-induced Experimental Cataract Model.
29326846|a|OBJECTIVES: To investigate the potential protective effects of sesamol in an experimental cataract model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-one Spraque Dawley rat pups were randomly assigned into three groups, seven rats in each. All the rats except for those in the control group were injected subcutaneously with a single dose of sodium selenite on postpartum day 9. On days 10-14, rats in the sham group were intraperitoneally administered 50 mg/kg/day saline solution, while rats in the sesamol group were given 50 mg/kg/day sesamol by the same route. Following cataract grading, the lenses and capsules were extracted and the mean levels of reduced glutathione (GSH), malondialdehyde (MDA), total antioxidant status (TAS) and total oxidant status (TOS) in lens supernatants were biochemically analyzed. RESULTS: The control group did not show any development of cataract. It was found that the mean cataract grade in the sesamol group was significantly lower than that of the sham group (p<0.05). The mean GSH level and TAS in the sesamol group were significantly higher than those of the sham group while the mean TOS and MDA level in the sesamol group were significantly lower than those of the sham group (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: Our study shows that sesamol reduces TOS and MDA level and increases TAS and GSH level in the lens and inhibits cataract formation.
