37628788|t|The Proteome Profile of Olfactory Ecto-Mesenchymal Stem Cells-Derived from Patients with Familial Alzheimer's Disease Reveals New Insights for AD Study.
37628788|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common neurodegenerative disease and the first cause of dementia worldwide, has no effective treatment, and its pathological mechanisms are not yet fully understood. We conducted this study to explore the proteomic differences associated with Familial Alzheimer's Disease (FAD) in olfactory ecto-mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) derived from PSEN1 (A431E) mutation carriers compared with healthy donors paired by age and gender through two label-free liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry approaches. The first analysis compared carrier 1 (patient with symptoms, P1) and its control (healthy donor, C1), and the second compared carrier 2 (patient with pre-symptoms, P2) with its respective control cells (C2) to evaluate whether the protein alterations presented in the symptomatic carrier were also present in the pre-symptom stages. Finally, we analyzed the differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) for biological and functional enrichment. These proteins showed impaired expression in a stage-dependent manner and are involved in energy metabolism, vesicle transport, actin cytoskeleton, cell proliferation, and proteostasis pathways, in line with previous AD reports. Our study is the first to conduct a proteomic analysis of MSCs from the Jalisco FAD patients in two stages of the disease (symptomatic and presymptomatic), showing these cells as a new and excellent in vitro model for future AD studies.
