40005452|t|The Effects of Remimazolam and Inhalational Anesthetics on the Incidence of Postoperative Hyperactive Delirium in Geriatric Patients Undergoing Hip or Femur Surgery Under General Anesthesia: A Retrospective Observational Study.
40005452|a|Background and Objectives: Postoperative delirium (POD) is a transient but significant complication in geriatric patients following hip or femur surgery. POD occurs in 19-65% of patients after hip surgeries, with notable risks associated with augmented morbidity, mortality, and prolonged hospitalization. The perioperative administration of benzodiazepines, particularly midazolam, is associated with an increased incidence of POD. Remimazolam, a novel ultra-short-acting benzodiazepine, has potential benefits, such as hemodynamic stability and ease of reversal, but its effect on POD occurrence remains unclear. Materials and Methods: This retrospective study investigated patients who were aged 65 years old and older who underwent hip or femur surgery. Following the application of exclusion criteria, 502 patients were grouped according to whether anesthesia was maintained with remimazolam (R group) or sevoflurane (S group). Data regarding patients' baseline characteristics, anesthetic details, and postoperative outcomes, including the incidence of POD, were gathered and analyzed. Propensity score matching and logistic regression were conducted to identify factors associated with POD and compare outcomes between the two groups. Results: Among the 502 patients, POD was observed in 161 (32%). The POD incidence was not statistically significantly different between the groups (p = 1.000). A multivariable logistic regression analysis indicated that remimazolam was not a determinant of POD (p = 0.860), whereas being male and polypharmacy were (p = 0.022; p = 0.047). Initial disparities in age and comorbid conditions between the groups were rectified through matching, demonstrating that remimazolam had a similar POD risk to sevoflurane. Conclusions: This study showed that remimazolam did not exacerbate the risk of POD in elderly patients undergoing hip or femur surgery. Remimazolam is a reliable anesthetic option for this vulnerable demographic. Also, this study's results indicated that polypharmacy and being male are POD risk factors, suggesting that meticulous perioperative medication management may help alleviate the risk of POD.
