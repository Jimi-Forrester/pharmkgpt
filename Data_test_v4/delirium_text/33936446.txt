33936446|t|Using Real-World Data to Rationalize Clinical Trials Eligibility Criteria Design: A Case Study of Alzheimer's Disease Trials.
33936446|a|Low trial generalizability is a concern. The Food and Drug Administration had guidance on broadening trial eligibility criteria to enroll underrepresented populations. However, investigators are hesitant to do so because of concerns over patient safety. There is a lack of methods to rationalize criteria design. In this study, we used data from a large research network to assess how adjustments of eligibility criteria can jointly affect generalizability and patient safety (i.e the number of serious adverse events [SAEs]). We first built a model to predict the number of SAEs. Then, leveraging an a priori generalizability assessment algorithm, we assessed the changes in the number of predicted SAEs and the generalizability score, simulating the process of dropping exclusion criteria and increasing the upper limit of continuous eligibility criteria. We argued that broadening of eligibility criteria should balance between potential increases of SAEs and generalizability using donepezil trials as a case study.
