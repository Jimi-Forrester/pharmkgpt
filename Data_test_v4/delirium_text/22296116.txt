22296116|t|Sequestosome 1/p62: across diseases.
22296116|a|Sequestosome 1/p62 is a signal modulator or adaptor protein involved in receptor-mediated signal transduction. Sequestosome 1/p62 is gaining attention as it is involved in several diseases including Parkinson disease, Alzheimer disease, liver and breast cancer, Paget's disease of bone, obesity and insulin resistance. In this review, we will focus on the most recent advances on the physiological function of p62 relevant to human diseases.
