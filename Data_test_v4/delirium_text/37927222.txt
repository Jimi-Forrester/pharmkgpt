37927222|a|OBJECTIVES: To determine if a multidisciplinary pathway focused on non-opioid pain management, delirium assessment, and resource utilization improved outcomes in geriatric hip fracture patients. The goal was to reduce opioid usage, consultation not congruent with guidelines, and increase use of regional anesthesia to reduce delirium and improve outcomes. METHODS: An observational study was performed on hip fracture patients before and after the intervention. Hospitalists were educated on indications for preoperative cardiac consultation and specialized preoperative cardiac testing according to evidence-based guidelines with the inpatient cardiology service. Additional education on multimodal analgesia, limiting opioids, and peripheral nerve blocks was provided by the acute pain service. Pre-intervention outcomes from 1 July 20171 July 2017 to 31 May 201831 May 2018 (N = 92) were compared to post-intervention outcomes from 1 July 20181 July 2018 to 31 May 201931 May 2019 (N = 98) and included delirium, length of stay, 30-day readmission rate, time from arrival to procedure start time, time to first physical therapy session, and completion of cardiology consult time. We examined adherence, use of nerve blocks, and pre- and post-operative pain scores and opioid use. RESULTS: Delirium was reduced from 50.0% (N = 46/92) to 28.6% (N = 28/98); p = 0.002. Postoperative opioid use (IV morphine milligram equivalents) decreased from an average of 57.2 mg (+-67.7) to 42.6 mg (+-58.2),P < .0001. There was a significant decrease in mean pre-operative (5.4 +- 4.14 to 5.05 +- 2.8, P < .0001) and post-operative pain scores (4.3 +- 5.2 to 3.2 +- 2.2, P < .0001). There was a significant reduction in time to cardiology consultation from 18 h] to 12 h ; p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: A multidisciplinary collaboration between hospitalists, anesthesiologists, and cardiologists for hip fracture patients was associated with a reduction in pain and delirium and time to cardiologist evaluation. Prospective studies focusing on additional patient-centered outcomes are warranted.
