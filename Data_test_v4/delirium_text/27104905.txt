27104905|a|BACKGROUND: Effective programs for promoting physical activity are needed for those with cognitive impairment. OBJECTIVE: To test the feasibility of mobile Health (mHealth) technology-supported physical activity prescription from a tertiary care memory clinic. METHODS: This feasibility study was designed as a 16-week randomized, crossover trial of a physical activity prescription: 8 weeks of intervention, 8 weeks of baseline or maintenance phase data collection. We recruited 2 cohorts: 21 individuals with Alzheimer-related cognitive impairment (mean age 72.3 (5.2), 9 females), and 9 individuals with normal cognition (mean age 69.6 (5.8), 8 females). We gave each cohort an mHealth accelerometer-based physical activity prescription to double number of steps taken. Our primary outcomes were feasibility and safety. Our secondary outcomes were change in weekly steps taken, Dementia Quality of Life Scale, Self-efficacy Scale, 6-minute Walk, and mini-Physical Performance Test. RESULTS: Set-up and use of the device was not a barrier to participation. However, only 62% of participants with cognitive impairment completed the intervention. The cohort with cognitive impairment did not change their weekly step count above Week 1. All participants in the cohort with normal cognition were able to set up and use their device and increased their weekly step count above Week 1. There were no differences between Week 1 and Week 8 for any secondary measures in either cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Setup and daily use of mHealth technology appears to be feasible for a person with cognitive impairment with the help of a partner, but increasing daily step counts over 8 weeks was not achieved. Future work needs to assess alternative activity prescription goals or additional support for patients and their partners.
