38999988|a|The orchestration of cellular metabolism and redox balance is a complex, multifaceted process crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis. Lipid droplets (LDs), once considered inert storage depots for neutral lipids, are now recognized as dynamic organelles critical in lipid metabolism and energy regulation. Mitochondria, the powerhouses of the cell, play a central role in energy production, metabolic pathways, and redox signaling. The physical and functional contacts between LDs and mitochondria facilitate a direct transfer of lipids, primarily fatty acids, which are crucial for mitochondrial beta-oxidation, thus influencing energy homeostasis and cellular health. This review highlights recent advances in understanding the mechanisms governing LD-mitochondria interactions and their regulation, drawing attention to proteins and pathways that mediate these contacts. We discuss the physiological relevance of these interactions, emphasizing their role in maintaining energy and redox balance within cells, and how these processes are critical in response to metabolic demands and stress conditions. Furthermore, we explore the pathological implications of dysregulated LD-mitochondria interactions, particularly in the context of metabolic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and their potential links to cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. Conclusively, this review provides a comprehensive overview of the current understanding of LD-mitochondria interactions, underscoring their significance in cellular metabolism and suggesting future research directions that could unveil novel therapeutic targets for metabolic and degenerative diseases.
