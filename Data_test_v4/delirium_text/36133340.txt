36133340|a|Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved catabolic process that can degrade cytoplasmic materials and recycle energy to maintain metabolite homeostasis in cells. Autophagy is closely related to various physiological or pathological processes. Macromolecular materials are widely used in drug delivery systems and disease treatments due to their intrinsic effects, such as altered pharmacokinetics and biodistribution. Interaction of autophagic flux or the signal pathway with macromolecules may cause autophagy inhibition or autophagy cell death. This review covers autophagy regulation pathways and macromolecular materials (including functional micelles, biodegradable and pH-sensitive polymers, biomacromolecules, dendrimers, coordination polymers, and hybrid nanoparticles) mediated autophagy modulation.
