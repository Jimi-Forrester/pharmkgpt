29190941|t|Associations between novel genetic variants in the promoter region of MALAT1 and risk of colorectal cancer.
29190941|a|The metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1), a well-known long non-coding RNA, is involved in pathogenesis and progress of multiple tumors. However, no study has been performed to investigate the relationship between the genetic variants in promoter region of MALAT1 and colorectal cancer risk. In this study, we conducted a two-stage case-control study to evaluate whether MALAT1 genetic variants were associated with colorectal cancer risk. We identified that a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1194338 was significantly associated with the decreased colorectal cancer risk with an odds ratio (OR) of 0.70 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.49-0.99] in the combined stage. The subsequently stratified analyses showed that the protective effect of rs1194338 was more pronounced in several subgroups. Furthermore, gene expression profiling analysis revealed overexpression of MALAT1 mRNA in colorectal cancer tissue compared with normal controls. Confirmation studies with large sample size and further mechanistic investigations into the function of MALAT1 and its genetic variants are warranted to advance our understanding of their roles in colorectal carcinogenesis, and to aid in the development of novel and targeted therapeutic strategies.
