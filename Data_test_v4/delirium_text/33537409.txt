33537409|t|Sympathomimetic-Induced Hyperthermia and Hyponatremia: A Simulation Case for Emergency Medicine Residents.
33537409|a|Introduction: MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine) is a popular drug of abuse associated with a variety of clinical manifestations. There are a number of life-threatening sequelae, including, but not limited to, agitated delirium, cardiac dysrhythmias, and hyperthermia. Similar to other substances that cause sympathomimetic toxidromes, MDMA also induces a syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion-like state resulting in hyponatremia. The management of hyperthermia is of particular importance, as time to correction, particularly at temperatures greater than 106  F, is directly associated with increased risk of morbidity and mortality. Methods: We created a simulation-based intervention to address and improve clinical skills relating to the management of MDMA intoxication. The scenario used a simulated patient to teach emergency medicine residents how to properly diagnose sympathomimetic toxicity and manage resultant hyperthermia and hyponatremia with cooling measures and appropriate fluid administration. Learners participated in a debrief session and were given an anonymous survey to assess their perceived knowledge. The case was performed as part of monthly emergency medicine resident didactics. Results: Eighteen learners took part in the case, with a 100% response rate. All participants agreed that the scenario increased their knowledge of cooling methods in severe hyperthermia, particularly whole-body packing. Eighty-nine percent (n = 16) reported that the scenario changed their practice patterns. Discussion: This simulated scenario requires minimal resources and can be instituted with emergency medicine residents from all levels of training. The scenario achieved its primary goal of improving residents' perceived knowledge of cooling measures in severe hyperthermia.
