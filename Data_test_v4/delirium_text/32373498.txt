32373498|a|Purpose: Stroke is one of the most common conditions causing death. There have been few studies examining the effects of alpha lipoic acid (ALA) on stroke patients. In this regard, the present randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted to examine the effects of ALA supplementation on serum albumin, and inflammatory and oxidative stress markers in stroke patients. Methods: The present paralleled randomized controlled clinical trial involved 42 stroke patients who were over 40 years and under enteral feeding. The participants were randomly assigned into two groups and finally 40 patients completed the study. Patients in alpha lipoic acid group (n=19) took 1200 mg ALA supplement daily along with their meal, and participants in control group (n=21) underwent the routine hospital diet for 3 weeks. Fasting blood samples were obtained and albumin, oxidative stress, and inflammatory indices were assessed at baseline, as well as at the end of the trial. Results: After 3 weeks, treatment of patients with ALA led to a significant decrease in tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) levels (P=0.01) compared to baseline. But serum levels of albumin, total antioxidant capacity (TAC), malondialdehyde (MDA), highsensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), IL-6 and TNF-alpha did not change significantly vs. control group (P>0.05). Conclusion: ALA did not significantly change the serum levels of albumin and inflammatory as well as antioxidant capacity indices in stroke patients compared with the control group. More clinical trials with large sample sizes and long duration are needed to clarify the effects of ALA on these patients.
