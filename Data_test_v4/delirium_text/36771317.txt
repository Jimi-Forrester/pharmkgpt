36771317|t|Implication of Vegetable Oil-Derived Hydroxynonenal in the Lysosomal Cell Death for Lifestyle-Related Diseases.
36771317|a|Lysosomes are membrane-bound vesicular structures that mediate degradation and recycling of damaged macromolecules and organelles within the cell. For ensuring the place of degradation within the acidic organelle, the integrity of the lysosomal-limiting membrane is critical in order to not injure the cell. As lysosomes fade away in response to acute intense insults or long-term mild insults, dissolving lysosomes are hardly detected during the phase of cell degeneration. If observed at the right time, however, lysosomal membrane rupture/permeabilization can be detected using an electron microscope. In both the experimental and clinical materials, here the author reviewed electron microphotographs showing disintegrity of the lysosomal-limiting membrane. Regardless of insults, cell types, organs, diseases, or species, leakage of lysosomal content occurred either by the apparent disruption of the lysosomal membrane (rupture) and/or through the ultrastructurally blurred membrane (permeabilization). Since lysosomal rupture occurs in the early phase of necrotic cell death, it is difficult to find vivid lysosomes after the cell death or disease are completed. A lipid peroxidation product, 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (hydroxynonenal), is incorporated into the serum by the intake of omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid-rich vegetable oils (exogenous), and/or is generated by the peroxidation of membrane lipids due to the oxidative stress (intrinsic). Exogenous and intrinsic hydroxynonenal may synergically oxidize the representative cell stress protein Hsp70.1, which has dual functions as a 'chaperone protein' and 'lysosomal stabilizer'. Hydroxynonenal-mediated carbonylation of Hsp70.1 facilitates calpain-mediated cleavage to induce lysosomal membrane rupture and the resultant cell death. Currently, vegetable oils such as soybean and canola oils are the most widely consumed cooking oils at home and in restaurants worldwide. Accordingly, high linoleic acid content may be a major health concern, because cells can become damaged by its major end product, hydroxynonenal. By focusing on dynamic changes of the lysosomal membrane integrity at the ultrastructural level, implications of its rupture/permeabilization on cell death/degeneration were discussed as an etiology of lifestyle-related diseases.
