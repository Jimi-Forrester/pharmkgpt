35253748|a|BACKGROUND: The oral ingestion of scallop-derived plasmalogen (sPlas) significantly improved cognitive function in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. OBJECTIVE: However, the effects and mechanisms of sPlas on AD with chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH), a class of mixed dementia contributing to 20-30% among the dementia society, were still elusive. METHODS: In the present study, we applied a novel mouse model of AD with CCH to investigate the potential effects of sPlas on AD with CCH. RESULTS: The present study demonstrated that sPlas significantly recovered cerebral blood flow, improved motor and cognitive deficits, reduced amyloid-beta pathology, regulated neuroinflammation, ameliorated neural oxidative stress, and inhibited neuronal loss in AD with CCH mice at 12 M. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that sPlas possesses clinical and pathological benefits for AD with CCH in the novel model mice. Furthermore, sPlas could have promising prevention and therapeutic effects on patients of AD with CCH.
