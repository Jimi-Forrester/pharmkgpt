The locus ceruleus has connections throughout the brain and spinal cord, so the characteristic widespread multifocal pathology in these disorders could be due to damage to different subsets of locus ceruleus neurons. Previous studies have shown that only certain locus ceruleus neurons accumulate the neurotoxic metal mercury. To find out if concentrations of other toxic metals or of essential trace elements also vary between individual locus ceruleus neurons, we used synchrotron X-ray fluorescence microscopy on frozen sections of locus ceruleus neurons taken from people with multiple sclerosis, in whom the locus ceruleus is structurally intact. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Paraffin embedded sections containing the locus ceruleus from seven people with multiple sclerosis were stained with autometallography that demonstrates accumulations of mercury, silver and bismuth. These were compared to maps of multiple elements obtained from frozen sections of locus ceruleus neurons from the same people using X-ray fluorescence microscopy. Neurons in the anterior pons from three of these donors were used as internal controls. RESULTS: Autometallography staining was observed in scattered locus ceruleus neurons from three of the seven donors. X-ray fluorescence microscopy showed variations among individual locus ceruleus neurons in levels of mercury, selenium, iron, copper, lead, bromine, and rubidium. Variations between donors of locus ceruleus neuronal average levels of mercury, iron, copper, and bromine were also detected. Anterior pons neurons contained no mercury, had varied levels of iron, and had lower copper levels than locus ceruleus neurons. CONCLUSIONS: Individual human locus ceruleus neurons contain varying levels of toxic metals and essential trace elements. In contrast, most toxic metals are absent or at low levels in nearby anterior pons neurons. The locus ceruleus plays a role in numerous central nervous system functions, including maintaining the blood-brain-barrier and limiting neuroinflammation. Toxic metals, or alterations in essential trace metals within individual locus ceruleus neurons, could be one factor determining the non-random destruction of locus ceruleus neurons in normal aging and neurodegenerative diseases, and subsequently the sites of the widespread multifocal central nervous system pathology in these disorders.
