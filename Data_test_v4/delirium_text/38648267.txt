38648267|t|Meningeal Lymphatics in Central Nervous System Diseases.
38648267|a|Since its recent discovery, the meningeal lymphatic system has reshaped our understanding of central nervous system (CNS) fluid exchange, waste clearance, immune cell trafficking, and immune privilege. Meningeal lymphatics have also been demonstrated to functionally modify the outcome of neurological disorders and their responses to treatment, including brain tumors, inflammatory diseases such as multiple sclerosis, CNS injuries, and neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. In this review, we discuss recent evidence of the contribution of meningeal lymphatics to neurological diseases, as well as the available experimental methods for manipulating meningeal lymphatics in these conditions. Finally, we also provide a discussion of the pressing questions and challenges in utilizing meningeal lymphatics as a prime target for CNS therapeutic intervention and possibly drug delivery for brain disorders.
