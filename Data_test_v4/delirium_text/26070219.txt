26070219|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by irreversible and progressive loss of memory and other cognitive functions. Controversies still exist on the precise mechanisms contributing to neurodegeneration. Obesity and disturbances in metabolic homeostasis are thought to be AD risk factors. Adipokine leptin has receptors in the brain, also in the regions related to AD. Leptin may protect against AD. The aim was to assess leptin and soluble leptin receptor levels in plasma as well as free leptin index (FLI) in correlation with metabolic status of women diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. Eighteen women with moderate to severe stage of AD, 40 women with AD at early stage, and 42 female controls, matched for age and body mass index, participated in the study. Leptin and soluble leptin receptor levels were measured with RIA and IRMA, respectively. Then, FLI was calculated. In addition, metabolic parameters (lipid profile, glucose and insulin concentrations, HOMA-IR) were estimated. Clinical and anthropometric data were collected. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) as a cognitive impairment measurement was performed. Correlations with both leptin and FLI, and MMSE, clinical and biochemical parameters were evaluated. Leptin levels and FLI were significantly lower and leptin receptor concentrations were higher in AD subjects when compared with the controls. In AD group leptin, soluble leptin receptor and FLI correlated with selected metabolic parameters but not with MMSE. We conclude that alterations in leptin, leptin receptor, and FLI were the most intensified in advanced AD. However, these results did not correlate with dementia stage measured with MMSE. Therefore, further intensive research is needed to explain the mechanisms involved in this phenomenon.
