31660164|t|Effect of foot care interventions for older adults using day care services.
31660164|a|AIM: This study explored the prevalence of foot problems among older adults and the effectiveness of foot care interventions for improving toe-gap force and foot flexibility. Foot problems are very common among people aged 65 years and older. However, the effects of foot care interventions on components underlying these issues (i.e., toe-gap force and foot flexibility) are unclear. DESIGN: This was a quasi-experimental study. METHODS: Eighteen older adults were divided into three groups: medical foot care intervention, combined intervention and control group. The combined intervention group received medical foot care, foot hygiene and five-toed socks. Toe-gap force and foot flexibility were measured. RESULTS: The most common foot problems were hallux valgus, toe deformities, nail discoloration and thickness and dryness. Significant differences in right foot toe-gap force were observed between the combined intervention and control groups. There were no significant differences in foot flexibility between groups.
