39770490|t|Experiences from Clinical Research and Routine Use of Florbetaben Amyloid PET-A Decade of Post-Authorization Insights.
39770490|a|Florbetaben (FBB) is a radiopharmaceutical approved by the FDA and EMA in 2014 for the positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of brain amyloid deposition in patients with cognitive impairment who are being evaluated for Alzheimer's disease (AD) or other causes of cognitive decline. Initially, the clinical adoption of FBB PET faced significant barriers, including reimbursement challenges and uncertainties regarding its integration into diagnostic clinical practice. This review examines the progress made in overcoming these obstacles and describes the concurrent evolution of the diagnostic landscape. Advances in quantification methods have further strengthened the traditional visual assessment approach. Over the past decade, compelling evidence has emerged, demonstrating that amyloid PET has a strong impact on AD diagnosis, management, and outcomes across diverse clinical scenarios, even in the absence of amyloid-targeted therapies. Amyloid PET imaging has become essential in clinical trials and the application of new AD therapeutics, particularly for confirming eligibility criteria (i.e., the presence of amyloid plaques) and monitoring biological responses to amyloid-lowering therapies. Since its approval, FBB PET has transitioned from a purely diagnostic tool aimed primarily at excluding amyloid pathology to a critical component in AD drug development, and today, it is essential in the diagnostic workup and therapy management of approved AD treatments.
