Amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), a pre-dementia stage is an important stage for early diagnosis and intervention. This study aimed to investigate the diagnostic value of qEEG, APOA-I, and APOE e4 allele in aMCI and AD patients and found the correlation between qEEG (Delta + Theta)/(Alpha + Beta) ratio (DTABR) and different cognitive domains. METHODS: All participants were divided into three groups: normal controls (NCs), aMCI, and AD, and all received quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG), neuropsychological scale assessment, apolipoprotein epsilon 4 (APOE e4) alleles, and various blood lipid indicators. Different statistical methods were used for different data. RESULTS: The cognitive domains except executive ability were all negatively correlated with DTABR in different brain regions while executive ability was positively correlated with DTABR in several brain regions, although without statistical significance. The consequences confirmed that the DTABR of each brain area were related to MMSE, MoCA, instantaneous memory, and the language ability (p < 0.05), and the DTABR in the occipital area was relevant to all cognitive domains (p < 0.01) except executive function (p = 0.272). Also, occipital DTABR was most correlated with language domain when tested by VFT with a moderate level (r = 0.596, p < 0.001). There were significant differences in T3, T5, and P3 DTABR between both AD and NC and aMCI and NCs. As for aMCI diagnosis, the maximum AUC was achieved when using T3 combined with APOA-I and APOE epsilon4 (0.855) and the maximum AUC was achieved when using T5 combined with APOA-I and APOE epsilon4 (0.889) for AD diagnosis. CONCLUSION: These findings highlight that APOA-I, APOE e4, and qEEG play an important role in aMCI and AD diagnosis. During AD continuum, qEEG DTABR should be taken into consideration for the early detection of AD risk.
