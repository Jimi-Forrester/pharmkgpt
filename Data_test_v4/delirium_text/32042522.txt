32042522|t|Role of Risk Factors in Developing Osmotic Demyelination Syndrome During Correction of Hyponatremia: A Case Study.
32042522|a|This case report describes a 57-year-old man who presented first with lethargy and dysarthria due to hyponatremia resulting from poor intake and diuretics. One week after discharge, he returned with confusion, ataxia and dysphagia, and he ultimately turned out to have developed an osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS). In his first hospital admission, his serum sodium was corrected without new neurological symptoms occurring. In retrospect, he had several risk factors for the development of ODS during the correction of hyponatremia. The serum sodium correction rate only briefly exceeded the recommended limits. This case underlines that (1) extra awareness of the serum sodium correction rate is warranted in patients with risk factors, (2) factors other than sodium can play an important role in the development of ODS and (3) that the manifestations of ODS can be delayed substantially after an incident of osmotic stress.
