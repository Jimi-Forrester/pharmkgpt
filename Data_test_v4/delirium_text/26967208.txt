26967208|t|Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease as a Risk Factor for Cognitive Dysfunction: A Meta-Analysis of Current Studies.
26967208|a|Cognitive dysfunction has been shown to be associated with many risk factors, such as smoking, diabetes, and body mass index. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a common disease within the elderly population, has also been found to be related to cognitive decline. However, whether COPD is a risk factor of cognitive dysfunction is not well established. The purpose of this meta-analysis is to investigate the role COPD plays in cognitive dysfunction. PubMed, Cochrane library and Web of Science databases were searched. Three cohort studies and eleven cross-sectional studies were found to be eligible. According to our results, COPD patients had a higher risk of cognitive dysfunction than controls (OR [odds ratio]: 1.72; 95% CI, 1.12-2.65; p = 0.01). The exacerbation of COPD was strongly correlated with cognitive decline. COPD patients performed worse than controls on the Mini- Mental State Examination test, but the results were not statistically significant (OR: -0.79; 95% CI, [-1.78, 0.19]; p = 0.11). Thus, more attention should be given to the occurrence of cognitive decline in COPD patients. The prevention and control of COPD exacerbation are critical.
