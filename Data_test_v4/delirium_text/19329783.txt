19329783|a|OBJECTIVE: Patients with dementia in 2 German community psychiatric hospitals with different treatment settings were investigated prospectively and treatment variables compared. METHOD: In each of the hospitals, which differ in treatment settings (Gutersloh specialized vs. Detmold integrated), 50 patients with dementia consecutively admitted were screened and compared according to personal data, clinical instruments, medication, and diagnosis. RESULTS: No relevant differences were found in the basic characteristics, average age was high (79 years), and patients were significantly restrained in functionality and cognitive functioning. Patients of Gutersloh were transferred to institutional care less frequently. Overall morbidity was high and little improvement in functioning at discharge was recorded. CONCLUSIONS: Data of this prospective study show that dementia patients were significantly restrained in cognitive and daily functioning along with high morbidity. Discharge to institutional care and discharge medication was reduced in patients of the special dementia care setting.
