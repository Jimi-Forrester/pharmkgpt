Recent successes in the development of amyloid-targeting immunotherapy approaches mark an important advancement in providing new options for the treatment of AD. We have developed a set of high-affinity monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to tau protein that have the potential as tools for diagnosis and treatment of AD. METHODS: Sheep were immunised with either full-length tau (1-441) or truncated paired helical filament (PHF)-core tau (297-391). A stringent bio-panning and epitope selection strategy, with a particular focus directed to epitopes within the disease-relevant PHF-core tau, was used to identify single-chain antibodies (scAbs). These scAbs were ranked by affinity for each epitope class, with leads converted to high-affinity mAbs. These antibodies and their potential utility were assessed by their performance in tau immunoassays, as well as their ability to prevent tau aggregation and propagation. Further characterisation of these antibodies was performed by immunohistochemical staining of brain sections and immuno-gold electronmicroscopy of isolated PHFs. RESULTS: Our work resulted in a set of high-affinity antibodies reacting with multiple epitopes spanning the entire tau protein molecule. The tau antibodies directed against the core tau unit of the PHF inhibited pathological aggregation and seeding using several biochemical and cell assay systems. Through staining of brain sections and PHFs, the panel of antibodies revealed which tau epitopes were available, truncated, or occluded. In addition, highly sensitive immunoassays were developed with the ability to distinguish between and quantify various tau fragments. CONCLUSION: This article introduces an alternative immunodiagnostic approach based on the concept of a "tauosome" - the diverse set of tau fragments present within biological fluids. The development of an antibody panel that can distinguish a range of different tau fragments provides the basis for a novel approach to potential diagnosis and monitoring of disease progression. Our results further support the notion that tau immunotherapy targeting the PHF-core needs to combine appropriate selection of both the target epitope and antibody affinity to optimise therapeutic potential.
