35872428|t|Tracking HOCl by an incredibly simple fluorescent probe with AIE plus ESIPT in vitro and in vivo.
35872428|a|Hypochlorous acid is an important active substance involved in a variety of physiological processes in living organisms, while abnormal concentrations of HOCl are strongly associated with a variety of diseases such as cancer, inflammation, atherosclerosis, and Alzheimer's disease. As a result, it's crucial to establish a reliable method for tracking HOCl in vivo in order to investigate its physiological consequences. In this work, we developed a fluorescent probe DFSN with both AIE and ESIPT for imaging HOCl in vivo. DFSN not only has a basic structure and is easy to synthesize, but also has superior performance. The probe responds to HOCl in less than 10 s and has good selectivity and sensitivity to HOCl (DL = 6.3 nM), with a 110-fold increase in fluorescence intensity following response. In addition, DFSN can realize the rapid detection of hypochlorous acid with naked eyes. Moreover, DFSN can be used for the detection of exogenous and endogenous HOCl in RAW264.7 cells, and additionally enables the tracking of HOCl in cancer cells (Hela cells and HepG2 cells). More notably, it has been utilized to image hypochlorous acid in zebrafish with great success. The probe DFSN will be useful in determining the physiological significance of HOCl.
