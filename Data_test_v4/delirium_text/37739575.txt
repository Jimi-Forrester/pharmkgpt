37739575|a|About 300 million adults undergo non-cardiac surgery annually. Although, in this setting, the incidence of perioperative stroke is low, the absolute number of patients experiencing a stroke is substantial. Furthermore, most patients with this complication will die or end up with severe disability. Covert brain infarctions are more frequent than overt strokes and are associated with postoperative delirium, cognitive decline, and cerebrovascular events at 1 year after surgery. Evidence shows that traditional stroke risk factors including older age, hypertension, and atrial fibrillation are also associated with perioperative stroke; previous stroke is the strongest risk factor for perioperative stroke. Increasing evidence also suggests the pathogenic role of perioperative events, such as hypotension, new atrial fibrillation, paradoxical embolism, and bleeding. Clinicians involved in perioperative care should be aware of this evidence on prevention strategies to improve patient outcomes after non-cardiac surgery.
