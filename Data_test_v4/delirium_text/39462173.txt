39462173|a|The benefits of tea consumption as a special diet for health and life satisfaction have attracted considerable attention; however, it is not clear whether the effect of tea consumption on self-rated health (SRH) and self-rated life satisfaction (SRL) is equal among all types of tea, and it is unclear whether these associations are impacted by gender and age in older adults. This study aimed to examine the associations between tea consumption, SRH and SRL in older adults and to explore the role of gender and age. Participants aged 65-105 (N = 78,345) were interviewed in the years 2002, 2005, 2008, 2011, 2014 and 2018 in the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Study (CLHLS). Generalized estimation equations (GEE) with the identity link function were adopted to estimate the cross-sectional associations of tea consumption with SRH and SRL. GEE with the logic link function were used to explore the longitudinal associations of tea consumption with SRH decline and SRL decline. Drinking tea at present, especially scented tea, was significantly associated with better SRH and SRL for older adults. Male participants benefited more from tea consumption than females, and the protective effect of green tea consumption on improving SRH and SRL in males was evident. Older adults aged 90-105 with current tea consumption daily had better SRH and reduced risk of SRL decline.
