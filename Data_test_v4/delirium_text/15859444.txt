15859444|t|Hallucinations and delirium in the dental office following triazolam administration.
15859444|a|A rare and unusual case of hallucinations following triazolam administration is reported. A review of the literature suggests that hallucinations following triazolam are rare; this is the first report of such a reaction when triazolam was used for oral conscious sedation in dentistry. A discussion of dental implications follows with emphasis on complete medical history evaluation before administering oral sedatives. We conclude that the proper selection of oral sedation candidates, coupled with recognition and management of adverse events, is essential.
