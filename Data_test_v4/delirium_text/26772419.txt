26772419|t|Delirium Associated With Lidocaine Patch Administration: A Case Presentation.
26772419|a|Delirium is a common complication among hospitalized elderly individuals. Systemic analgesics are known precipitating factors for delirium. However, the risk from topical pain agents is not well documented. We report a case of a woman who developed delirium after the application of a lidocaine patch. Although lidocaine patches are generally perceived as safe, clinicians should be aware of delirium as a potential adverse effect, particularly in older patients. This report also highlights the role of a systematic approach of staff education, use of a standardized protocol, and interdisciplinary communication in the identification and management of delirium in acute rehabilitation facilities.
