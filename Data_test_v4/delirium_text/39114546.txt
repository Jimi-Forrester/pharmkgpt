39114546|t|Clinical Heterogeneity in Alzheimer's Disease: A Possible New Amnesic Phenotype.
39114546|a|We rediscovered a phenotype of AD known in the early 1900s as presbyophrenia, but then forgotten, and renamed as confabulation-misidentification phenotype. The phenotype includes diencephalic amnesia whose prototype is Korsakoff syndrome. The main features are anterograde and retrograde amnesia with marked disorientation and confabulation, executive impairments, reduced insight and attention deficits, misidentification, minor hallucination and other delusions, behavioral disturbances, and early anxiety. In this article, we summarize what we have discovered about the new phenotype and what is still missing to confirm this diencephalic variant of AD.
