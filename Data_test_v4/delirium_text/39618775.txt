39618775|t|Implementing Early Rehabilitation Strategies for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Patients Undergoing Mechanical Ventilation in the Intensive Care Unit.
39618775|a|BACKGROUND: Patients afflicted with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) frequently manifest acute respiratory failure (ARF), characterized by hypercapnia, hypoxia, malnutrition, muscle weakness, heightened work of breathing (WOB), recurrent acute exacerbations, reliance on mechanical ventilation (MV), and difficulties in the weaning phase. Early implementation of rehabilitation interventions holds promise in mitigating prolonged MV and, consequently, reducing intensive care unit (ICU) morbidity and mortality. METHODOLOGY: A prospective study was undertaken involving COPD type 2 respiratory failure patients receiving MV in an ICU setting. Random assignment was employed to allocate patients to either the experimental or control groups. Both groups received chest physiotherapy, range-of-motion exercises, and standard medical and nursing care. The experimental group additionally underwent early active rehabilitation exercises, including limb strength training and progressive mobility tasks. Various parameters such as mechanical ventilator duration, ICU length of stay (LOS), mortality, and occurrence of adverse events were documented. Group differences were analyzed using independent t-tests. RESULTS: Among 52 patients, 33 were assigned randomly to each group using sealed envelopes. After withdrawals, 15 patients remained in each group. The experimental group had significantly shorter durations of MV (2.29 +- 0.61 vs 2.86 +- 0.66 days; 95% CI: -1.06 to -0.07, t = -2.37, P = 0.02) and ICU stay (7.66 +- 1.17 vs 8.86 +- 1.68 days; 95% CI: -2.28 to -0.11, t = -2.26, P = 0.03) compared to the control group. ICU mortality rates were similar between groups (1.93 +- 0.25 vs 1.93 +- 0.25; 95% CI: -0.19 to 0.19, t = 0.00, P = 1.00). The experimental group had a higher incidence of non-serious adverse events (0.66 +- 0.48 vs 0.26 +- 0.45 events; 95% CI: -0.04 to -0.75, t = 2.31, P = 0.02) and primarily transient physiological changes. CONCLUSION: Engaging the early active rehabilitation exercises for mechanically ventilated COPD patients is practical and results in a reduction in MV duration, consequently shortening the ICU LOS.
