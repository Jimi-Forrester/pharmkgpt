Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and hiatal hernia have been associated with morbidity across a range of clinical scenarios, yet their relation to recovery from pulmonary resection is understudied. We evaluated GERD and hiatal hernia as predictors of complications after lobectomy for lung cancer. Methods: Lobectomy patients at Yale-New Haven Hospital between January 2014 and April 2021 were evaluated for predictors of 30-day postoperative complications, pneumonia, atrial arrhythmia, readmission, and mortality. Multivariable regression models included sociodemographic characteristics, body mass index, surgical approach, cardiopulmonary comorbidities, hiatal hernia, GERD, and preoperative acid-suppressive therapy as predictors. Results: Overall, 824 patients underwent lobectomy, including 50.5% with a hiatal hernia and 38.7% with GERD. The median age was 68 [interquartile range, 61-74] years, and the majority were female (58.4%). At least 1 postoperative complication developed in 39.6% of patients, including atrial arrhythmia (11.7%) and pneumonia (4.1%). Male sex (odds ratio [OR], 1.51; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.11-2.06, P = .01), age >=70 years (OR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.13-2.11, P = .01), hiatal hernia (OR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.03-1.90, P = .03), and intraoperative packed red blood cells (OR, 4.80; 95% CI, 1.51-15.20, P = .01) were significant risk factors for developing at least 1 postoperative complication. Hiatal hernia was also a significant predictor of atrial arrhythmia (OR, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.02-2.62, P = .04) but was not associated with other adverse events. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that hiatal hernia may be a novel risk factor for complications, especially atrial arrhythmia, following lobectomy that should be considered in the preoperative evaluation of lung cancer patients.
