11594562|t|Design and conduct of clinical trials in hormone replacement therapy.
11594562|a|Postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy represents an area of outstanding importance in preventive medicine that greatly affects personal well-being as well as public health. The number of women living in the United States who are 50 years or older has been estimated at nearly 50 million. Many of those women are likely to be eligible for postmenopausal hormone replacement, which may consist either of estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) in women without a uterus or, more frequently, estrogen/progestin combination therapy (HRT) in women with a uterus. This chapter first presents an overview of general regulatory requirements pertaining to the design and conduct of clinical studies in support of marketing approval for a drug product. These requirements include, but are not restricted to, studies in HRT. The chapter next discusses the design and conduct of clinical trials in support of marketing approval for the indications: treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms and vulvovaginal atrophy; prevention of osteoporosis; and protection by adjunctive progestin against estrogen-induced endometrial hyperplasia/cancer in women with a uterus. Finally, data related to the potential cardioprotective action of HRT and its protection against Alzheimer's disease and colon cancer are discussed.
