38139861|t|Sialic Acid Mimetic Microglial Sialic Acid-Binding Immunoglobulin-like Lectin Agonism: Potential to Restore Retinal Homeostasis and Regain Visual Function in Age-Related Macular Degeneration.
38139861|a|Age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a leading cause of visual loss and dysfunction worldwide, is a disease initiated by genetic polymorphisms that impair the negative regulation of complement. Proteomic investigation points to altered glycosylation and loss of Siglec-mediated glyco-immune checkpoint parainflammatory and inflammatory homeostasis as the main determinant for the vision impairing complications of macular degeneration. The effect of altered glycosylation on microglial maintained retinal para-inflammatory homeostasis and eventual recruitment and polarization of peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages (PBMDMs) into the retina can explain the phenotypic variability seen in this clinically heterogenous disease. Restoring glyco-immune checkpoint control with a sialic acid mimetic agonist targeting microglial/macrophage Siglecs to regain retinal para-inflammatory and inflammatory homeostasis is a promising therapeutic that could halt the progression of and improve visual function in all stages of macular degeneration.
