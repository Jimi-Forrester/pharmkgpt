38190948|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia and is rapidly becoming one of the most costly, fatal diseases, which is typically discovered in the late stage of molecular pathology, at which point medication intervention is irreversible. As a result, there is an urgent need for a low-cost, least-invasive way of screening cognitive impairment, with the goal of identifying persons at risk of AD. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) has been described as a transitional state between normal cognitive aging and AD. Early detection and timely tracking of MCI can to some extent prevent the progression towards AD. We found a population in Northwestern China has a comparatively high prevalence of MCI. Continued education, consistent exercise, and a secure financial situation can all help older people maintain cognitive function. Due to the critical role of circulating microRNAs in intercellular signaling and the perturbations thereof, their investigation has assumed paramount significance in elucidating various pathological conditions. Numerous investigations have substantiated the significance of circulating miRNAs specifically in MCI. Here, we evaluated miR-483-5p (Area Under the Curve (AUC) is 0.901, sensitivity 79.2 % and specificity 100 %) and miR-502-5p (AUC is 0.872, sensitivity 79.2 % and specificity 83.3 %), which were derived from plasma exosomes and maintained at high levels in elderly people with MCI, could be employed as promising noninvasive biomarkers.
