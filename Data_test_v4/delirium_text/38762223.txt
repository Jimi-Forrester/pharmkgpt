38762223|a|BACKGROUND: As populations age globally, effectively managing geriatric health poses challenges for primary care. Comprehensive geriatric assessments (CGAs) aim to address these challenges through multidisciplinary screening and coordinated care planning. However, most CGA tools and workflows have not been optimised for routine primary care delivery. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the impact of a computerised CGA tool, called the Golden Age Visit, implemented in primary care in Israel. METHODS: This study employed a quasiexperimental mixed-methods design to evaluate outcomes associated with the Golden Age electronic health assessment tool. Quantitative analysis used electronic medical records data from Maccabi Healthcare Services, the second largest health management organisation (HMO) in Israel. Patients aged 75 and older were included in analyses from January 2017 to December 2019 and January 2021 to December 2022. For patients, data were also collected on controls who did not participate in the Golden Age Visit programme during the same time period, to allow for comparison of outcomes. For physicians, qualitative data were collected via surveys and interviews with primary care physicians who used the Golden Age Visit SMARTEST e-assessment tool. RESULTS: A total of 9022 community-dwelling adults aged 75 and older were included in the study: 1421 patients received a Golden Age Visit CGA (intervention group), and 7601 patients did not receive the assessment (control group). After CGAs, diagnosis rates increased significantly for neuropsychiatric conditions and falls. Referrals to physiotherapy, occupational therapy, dietetics and geriatric outpatient clinics also rose substantially. However, no differences were found in rates of hip fracture or relocation to long-term care between groups. Surveys among physicians (n=151) found high satisfaction with the programme. CONCLUSION: Implementation of a large-scale primary care CGA programme was associated with improved diagnosis and management of geriatric conditions. Physicians were also satisfied, suggesting good uptake and feasibility within usual care. Further high-quality studies are still needed but these results provide real-world support for proactively addressing geriatric health needs through structured screening models.
