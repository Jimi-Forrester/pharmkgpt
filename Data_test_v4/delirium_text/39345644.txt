39345644|a|Dysfunction of the endolysosomal system within neurons is a prominent feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. Multiple AD-risk factors are known to cause hyper-activity of the early-endosome small GTPase rab5, resulting in neuronal endosomal pathway disruption. APPL1, an important rab5 effector protein, is an interface between endosomal and neuronal function through a rab5-activating interaction with the BACE1-generated C-terminal fragment (betaCTF or C99) of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), a pathogenic APP fragment generated within endolysosomal compartments. To better understand the role of APPL1 in the AD endosomal phenotype, we generated a transgenic mouse model over-expressing human APPL1 within neurons (Thy1-APPL1 mice). Consistent with the important endosomal regulatory role of APPL1, Thy1-APPL1 mice have enlarged neuronal early endosomes and increased synaptic endocytosis due to increased rab5 activation. We additionally demonstrate pathological consequences of APPL1 overexpression, including functional changes in hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), as well as degeneration of the large projection cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain and impairment of hippocampal-dependent memory. Our findings show that increased neuronal APPL1 levels lead to a cascade of pathological effects within neurons, including early endosomal alterations, synaptic dysfunction, and neurodegeneration. Multiple risk factors and molecular regulators, including APPL1 activity, are known to contribute to the endosomal dysregulation seen in the early stages of AD, and these findings further highlight the shared pathobiology and consequences to a neuron of early endosomal pathway disruption. Significance Statement: Dysfunction in the endolysosomal system within neurons is a key feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Multiple AD risk factors lead to hyperactivity of the early-endosome GTPase rab5, disrupting neuronal pathways including the cholinergic circuits involved early in memory decline. APPL1, a crucial rab5 effector, connects endosomal and neuronal functions through its interaction with a specific amyloid precursor protein (APP) fragment generated within endosomes. To understand APPL1's role, a transgenic mouse model over-expressing human APPL1 in neurons (Thy1-APPL1 mice) was developed. These mice show enlarged early endosomes and increased synaptic endocytosis due to rab5 activation, resulting in impaired hippocampal long-term potentiation and depression, the degeneration of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons, and memory deficits, highlighting a pathological cascade mediated through APPL1 at the early endosome.
