37551251|t|Marchiafava-Bignami Disease: A Rare Association With Dysdiadochokinesia and Ataxic Gait.
37551251|a|Marchiafava-Bignami disease (MBD) is a rare neurological disorder characterized by demyelination and necrosis of the corpus callosum. The non-specific signs and symptoms associated with MBD including dysarthria, impaired walking, pyramidal signs, primitive reflexes, seizures, incontinence, sensory symptoms, gaze palsies, and altered mental state result in a challenging diagnosis. Here, we report the case of a 64-year-old female presenting with dizziness, gait ataxia, and a history of recurrent falls for several months. Initial blood tests indicated anaemia, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and mildly elevated inflammatory markers. Her presentation was initially attributed to a multifactorial aetiology, including a urinary tract infection, orthostatic hypotension, and electrolyte imbalances; however, on correction of reversible causes, her symptoms persisted. Moreover, further examination revealed right-hand dysdiadochokinesia. Subsequent brain MRI revealed fluid-attenuated inversion recovery hyperintensity within the corpus callosum and a right-sided pericallosal white matter hyperintensity. Neuro-radiology multidisciplinary team reported these findings consistent with MBD. Management with vitamin B supplementation was promptly initiated alongside alcohol cessation advice. She was also reviewed by physiotherapy teams. This case adds to the paucity of literature on MBD.
