36716786|t|Evaluation of the Efficacy of Human Dental Pulp Stem Cell Transplantation in Sprague-Dawley Rats with Sensorial Neural Hearing Loss.
36716786|a|OBJECTIVES:  The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of spiral ganglion neuron (SGN) regeneration after dental pulp stem cell (DPSC) transplantation in a rat sensorineural hearing loss (HL) model. MATERIALS AND METHODS:  Sham or experimental HL was induced in adult Sprague-Dawley rats by cochlear round window surgery. An HL rat model was established with a single 10 mM ouabain intratympanic injection. After 7 days, the rats received DPSCs, stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHED), or culture medium in the sutural area to establish four groups: sham, HL-DPSC, HL-SHED, and HL-medium. Histological analyses were performed at 4, 7, and 10 weeks after transplantation, and the number of SGNs, specific SGN protein expression, and the function of SGNs were evaluated. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS:  Data were statistically by MS Excel and SPSS v.15.0. Intergroup level of significance was determined via a one-way analysis of variance and Duncan's multiple range test with 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS:  New SGN formation was observed in the HL-DPSC and HL-SHED rat groups. The number of SGNs was significantly higher in the HL-DPSC and HL-SHED groups than in the HL-medium group over 4 to 10-week survival period. HL-DPSC rats exhibited higher SGN density compared with that in HL-SHED group, which was statistically significant at week 10. The regenerated SGNs expressed cochlear wiring regulator GATA-binding-protein 3. Moreover, the SGNs from the HL-DPSC group also exhibited a higher expression of synaptic vesicle protein and regulated action potential-dependent neurotransmitter release compared with SGNs from the HL-SHED group. CONCLUSIONS:  Our findings suggest that DPSCs and SHED repair and regenerate SGNs in rat HL model. Dental pulp stem cells represent a promising treatment strategy for restoring damage to the sensory circuits associated with deafness.
