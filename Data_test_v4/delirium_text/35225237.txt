35225237|t|[The identification and diagnosis of delirium in older adults: which rapid detection tools?]
35225237|a|Delirium is very common in hospitalized older patients and associated with serious clinical outcomes, notably increased risk of functional decline and death. Despite its high prevalence in the hospital setting, delirium is still underdiagnosed. A better identification would allow an early management and a reduction of its complications. To achieve this, the validation of formalized, easy-to-use and quick tools for the identification of delirium and their implementation in our clinical practice are necessary. The objective of this narrative review is to describe the available tools for delirium identification most commonly used in clinical practice and in research, followed by those that are quick to very quick to complete (i.e., less than 3 minutes). This review identified 4 tools frequently used internationally (CAM, DRS-R-98, DOSS, MDAS). Their completion time varies from 5 to 30 minutes. Rapid or very rapid tools exist, with very good diagnostic performance. Among them, the 4AT, the 3D-CAM and the UB-CAM seem particularly promising. These last tools seem interesting for a large-scale implementation at the national level, but a validation in French remains to be done.
