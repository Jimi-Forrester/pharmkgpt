32995715|t|Assessing Splanchnic Compartment Using Portal Venous Doppler and Impact of Adding It to the EVEREST Score for Risk Assessment in Heart Failure.
32995715|a|BACKGROUND: The Efficacy of Vasopressin Antagonism in Heart Failure: Outcome Study with Tolvaptan (EVEREST) score has proven useful for risk prediction in acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF). However, this score does not include the characterization of the splanchnic compartment, which has been involved in worsening heart failure. Refining this score by integrating an assessment of the splanchnic compartment would allow for a better risk assessment. Therefore, we aimed to characterize the patterns of portal vein pulsatility (PVP), an ultrasound metric used for the assessment of splanchnic compartment and their determinants in patients with ADHF, to explore the relationships between abnormal patterns of PVP and outcomes, and to evaluate the added value of PVP to the EVEREST score for risk assessment in ADHF. METHODS: Portal vein flow was assessed prospectively on admission and at discharge in 95 patients with ADHF using pulsed-wave Doppler. Abnormal PVP was defined for values >= 50%. Cox proportional hazards models were used for the assessment of the relationship between PVP and outcomes. RESULTS: Overall, 64% of patients on admission and 24% at discharge had abnormal PVP. PVP on admission was inversely correlated with right ventricular function (tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion, rho = -0.434) and pulmonary pressure (rho = 0.346), P < 0.05. Although PVP was associated with all-cause mortality (hazard ratio, 1.028, P < 0.001), the addition of this metric to the EVEREST score had little effect on its C-index (0.813 vs 0.818) for risk assessment. CONCLUSIONS: Abnormal PVP is frequent and associated with right ventricular dysfunction in ADHF. Although abnormal PVP identifies higher-risk patients, this metric does not improve the performance of the EVEREST score for risk assessment.
