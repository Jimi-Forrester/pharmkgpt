15709471|t|The contribution of microscopy to the study of Alzheimer's disease, amyloid plaques and Abeta fibrillogenesis.
15709471|a|A broad survey is presented in this chapter, dealing with the impact that microscopy has made to the study of Alzheimer's disease, amyloid plaques and amyloid-beta fibrillogenesis. This includes classical light microscopy and the modem immunolabelling and confocal microscopies, together with the contribution of transmission electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. Whilst usefully standing alone, the individual microscopies often contribute most effectively when they are integrated with cellular, biophysical and molecular approaches.
