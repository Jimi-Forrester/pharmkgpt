36254331|t|Cardiorenal Interactions: A Review.
36254331|a|A complex interaction occurs between cardiac and renal function. They are intricately tied together, and a range of disorders in both the heart and kidneys can alter the function of the other. The pathophysiology is complex, and these conditions are termed cardiorenal syndromes. They can be acute and/or chronic in nature, they result in and from hemodynamic consequences, systemic congestion, and metabolic abnormalities, and they lead to dysfunction of both the heart and kidneys. The aim of this article is to provide a review for cardiologists and intensivists who are treating patients for whom cardiac and renal interactions may complicate their picture. We review acute kidney injuries, management of the complications of renal dysfunction, renal replacement therapy, and cardiorenal syndromes.
