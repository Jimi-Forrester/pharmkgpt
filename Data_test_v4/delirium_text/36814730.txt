36814730|t|Kidney Transplant Outcomes in Recipients Over the Age of 70.
36814730|a|BACKGROUND: Patients older than 70 years are the fastest-growing age group of patients requiring renal replacement therapy. This has resulted in a corresponding increase in the number of elderly transplant recipients. We hypothesized that graft survival in this population would be comparable to that seen in the literature on kidney transplant recipients under 70 years of age. METHODS: This was a retrospective, single-center review of outcomes of kidney transplant recipients aged >=70 years. Patients were dichotomized based on whether their allograft originated from a living or deceased donor. RESULTS: A total of 59 recipients aged >=70 years underwent kidney transplantation. Of these, five (8.5%) were lost to follow-up within the first year post transplant and excluded from the analysis. History of cerebrovascular accident (p = 0.003), coronary artery disease (p = 0.03), postoperative return to the operating room (p = 0.03), and readmission within one year of transplant were predictive of graft loss (p = 0.003). Overall graft survival in our cohort declined from 92.6% at one year to 53.8% at five years. Death-censored graft survival was 100% at one year and decreased to 80.8% at five years. There were no differences seen in patient, graft, or death-censored graft survival based on donor type. CONCLUSIONS: Kidney transplant patients over 70 years, as seen in our cohort, had good short-term outcomes. Graft survival is similar to rates seen in younger cohorts but the decline in this rate over time is steeper in the older age group, possibly due to decreased patient survival. These findings could be validated further in larger multi-center studies.
