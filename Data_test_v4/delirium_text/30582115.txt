30582115|t|Psychosis as an indicator of recurrent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma: a rare presentation.
30582115|a|Psychotic manifestations of brain tumours are rare but described in the literature mostly along with other neurological deficits. Memory loss, difficulty in attention and concentration, depression, anxiety, and mood symptoms are commonly described in brain tumours. A schizophrenia-like picture without a deficit in motor or sensory function may land the clinician into a diagnostic dilemma. Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is a highly malignant disease with high mortality and needs immediate attention. Our case which had a unique recurrence in the postoperative period with psychotic symptoms can be an eye-opener to be more vigilant about underlying clinical extension.
