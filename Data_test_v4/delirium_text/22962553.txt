22962553|t|Changes in phospholipid composition of erythrocyte membrane in Alzheimer's disease.
22962553|a|BACKGROUND: There are several reports indicating a decrease of ethanolamine plasmalogen (pl-PE) in brain tissues and in serum of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The present study aimed to examine the composition of erythrocyte phospholipids including pl-PE in patients with AD. METHOD: A high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method that can separate intact plasmalogens and all other phospholipid classes by a single chromatographic run was used. RESULTS: The ratios of pl-PE, phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylserine (PS) to sphingomyelin were low as compared to those of the age-matched controls. CONCLUSION: These changes in erythrocyte phospholipids may reflect changes induced by oxidative stress, indicating the presence of high oxidative stress in the peripheral blood of AD patients.
