38471397|a|BACKGROUND: Blood-based biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) have become increasingly important as scalable tools for diagnosis and determining clinical trial eligibility. P-tau217 is the most promising due to its excellent sensitivity and specificity for AD-related pathological changes. METHODS: We compared the performance of two commercially available plasma p-tau217 assays (ALZpath p-tau217 and Janssen p-tau217+) in 294 individuals cross-sectionally. Correlations with amyloid PET and tau PET were assessed, and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analyses evaluated both p-tau217 assays for identifying AD pathology. FINDINGS: Both plasma p-tau217 assays were strongly associated with amyloid and tau PET. Furthermore, both plasma p-tau217 assays identified individuals with AD vs other neurodegenerative diseases (ALZpath AUC = 0.95; Janssen AUC = 0.96). Additionally, plasma p-tau217 concentrations rose with AD severity and their annual changes correlated with tau PET annual change. INTERPRETATION: Both p-tau217 assays had excellent diagnostic performance for AD. Our study supports the future clinical use of commercially-available assays for p-tau217.
