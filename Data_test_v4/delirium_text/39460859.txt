39460859|t|The connection between anemia and limitations in daily activities among older males: the critical role of dynapenia.
39460859|a|AIM: The aim of the present study was to examine the relationship between anemia and basic and instrumental activities of daily living in older male patients. METHODS: A total of 223 older males attending one geriatric outpatient clinic were included in this cross-sectional study. Anemia was defined as a hemoglobin level below 13 g/dL. Patients' demographic characteristics, comorbidities, and comprehensive geriatric assessment parameters were also recorded. Handgrip strength of < 27 kg for males was accepted as dynapenia. Basic Activities of Daily Living (BADL) and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) questionnaires were used to evaluate functional capacity. RESULTS: The mean age (standard deviation) of the participants was 80.17 (7.69) years. The prevalence of patients with anemia was 43.9%. There was differences between anemic and non-anemic groups in terms of presence of diabetes mellitus (DM), congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic kidney disease (CKD), malnutrition, dynapenia, geriatric depression, BADL and IADL scores (all p < 0.05). In multivariate analysis, after adjusting for all confounding variables except for dynapenia, patients with anemia were associated with reduced BADL and IADL (all p < 0.05). After adjusting for all confounding variables including dynapenia, deterioration in total BADL and IADL scores did not remain significant in the anemic group compared to the non-anemic group (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Close to one in two older outpatient men had anemia. Anemic men had a higher incidence of DM, CHF, CKD, malnutrition, geriatric depression and dynapenia. Anemia was associated with dependence in both BADL and IADL in older men. However, comorbidities, nutritional status, depressive mood and, specifically muscle strength, were important contributors to this association.
