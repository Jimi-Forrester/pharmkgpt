32028642|t|NADPH Oxidase-Mediated Activation of Neutral Sphingomyelinase Is Responsible for Diesel Particulate Extract-Induced Keratinocyte Apoptosis.
32028642|a|Human epidermis is positioned at the interface with the external environment, protecting our bodies against external challenges, including air pollutants. Emerging evidence suggests that diesel particulate extract (DPE), a major component of air pollution, leads to impairment of diverse cellular functions in keratinocytes (KC). In this study, we investigated the cellular mechanism underlying DPE-induced KC apoptosis. We first addressed cell death occurring in KC exposed to DPE, paralleled by increased activation of NADPH oxidases (NOXs) and subsequent ROS generation. Blockade of NOX activation with a specific inhibitor attenuated the expected DPE-induced KC apoptosis. In contrast, pre-treatment with a specific inhibitor of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation did not reverse DPE/NOX-mediated increase in KC apoptosis. We next noted that NOX-mediated KC apoptosis is mainly attributable to neutral sphingomyelinase (SMase)-mediated stimulation of ceramides, which is a well-known pro-apoptotic lipid. Moreover, we found that inhibition of NOX activation significantly attenuated DPE-mediated increase in the ratio of ceramide to its key metabolite sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), an important determinant of cell fate. Together, these results suggest that activation of neutral SMase serves as a key downstream signal for the DPE/NOX activation-mediated alteration in ceramide and S1P productions, and subsequent KC apoptosis.
