38139257|t|Exploring the Effect of Deep-Sea Water on the Therapeutic Potential of the Anti-Inflammatory Response in an Indomethacin-Induced Gastric Ulcer Rat Model.
38139257|a|Gastric ulcers are often exacerbated by factors such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and inflammation, and they have a substantial impact on a significant portion of the population. Notably, indomethacin is recognized as a prominent contributor to ulcers. This study investigated this potential method, with normalization to the anti-inflammatory and antiulcer properties of deep-sea water (DSW)-derived mineral water, using an indomethacin-induced gastric ulcer model in rats. The study involved four groups (n = 6 rats/group): normal control group (CON), indomethacin-only group (IND), indomethacin with trace mineral water group (TM), and indomethacin with high magnesium low sodium water group (HMLS). For three weeks, the CON and IND groups consumed tap water, while the TM and HMLS groups had access to mineral water. Gastric ulcers were induced on the final day using indomethacin, for all groups except the CON group. The results demonstrated that HMLS intake significantly improved gastric mucosal damage, preserved mucin stability, and increased gastric thickness, indicating its potential to prevent and alleviate indomethacin-induced gastric ulcers. Furthermore, HMLS consumption led to the upregulation of key genes associated with inflammation and a reduction in inflammatory cytokines. These findings suggest that DSW-derived mineral water, and particularly its high Mg2+ content, may offer promising health benefits including anti-inflammatory and anti-ulcer properties.
