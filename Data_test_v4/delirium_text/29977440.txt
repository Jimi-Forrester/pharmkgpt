29977440|t|CareHeroes Web and Android  Apps for Dementia Caregivers: A Feasibility Study.
29977440|a|The purpose of the current feasibility study was to examine the use, utility, and areas for refinement of a newly developed web-based and Android  application (app) (i.e., CareHeroes) with multiple features to support individuals caring for loved ones with Alzheimer's disease or other forms of dementia (AD). The study was performed over an 11-week period with triads of AD caregivers, assigned home care case managers, and primary care providers (PCP). The study involved quantitative and qualitative methodologies. Eleven AD caregivers (seven daughters, two sons, and two spouses), six case managers, and five PCPs participated. Data demonstrate participants were mostly satisfied with the multiple features and ability to access and use CareHeroes. Barriers for use include concerns about time constraints and not being familiar with technology. Although the study findings are promising, a longer term study to evaluate the impact of the CareHeroes app is indicated.
