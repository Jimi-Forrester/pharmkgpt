33954904|t|Obscure Involvement of MYC in Neurodegenerative Diseases and Neuronal Repair.
33954904|a|MYC is well known as a potent oncogene involved in regulating cell cycle and metabolism. Augmented MYC expression leads to cell cycle dysregulation, intense cell proliferation, and carcinogenesis. Surprisingly, its increased expression in neurons does not induce their proliferation, but leads to neuronal cell death and consequent development of a neurodegenerative phenotype. Interestingly, while cancer and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease are placed at the opposite sides of cell division spectrum, both start with cell cycle dysregulation and stimulation of proliferation. It seems that MYC action directed toward neuron cell proliferation and neural tissue repair collides with evolutional loss of regenerative capacity of CNS neurons in order to strengthen synaptic structure, to protect our cognitive abilities and therefore character. Accordingly, there are abundant mechanisms that block its expression and action specifically in the brain. Moreover, while MYC expression in brain neurons during neurodegenerative processes is related to their death, there are obvious evidences that MYC action after physical injury is beneficial in case of peripheral nerve recovery. MYC might be a useful tool to repair brain cells upon development of neurodegenerative disease or CNS trauma, including stroke and traumatic brain and spinal cord injury, as even imperfect axonal growth and regeneration strategies will likely be of profound benefit. Understanding complex control of MYC action in the brain might have important therapeutic significance, but also it may contribute to the comprehension of development of neurodegenerative diseases.
