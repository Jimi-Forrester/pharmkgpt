38974565|a|Background: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a global health problem with the potential to cause dangerous neurological problems. Based on histopathological findings in Sprague Dawley (SD) rats with TBI in the acute phase, the study seeks to discover the effect of Centella asiatica, cinnamon, and spirulina as neuroprotective. Methods: We conducted an experimental study with 30 SD rats randomly divided into three groups. The intervention was the administration of C. asiatica, cinnamon, and spirulina to the control and the experimental groups. Histological features were assessed using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and immunohistochemical examination. The data were analyzed using statistical analysis through correlation tests. Results: The test samples' average body weights had P > 0.05, indicating no significant difference in the test sample body weights. Therefore, the variations in the expression level of the dependent variable were expected to be caused by the induction of brain injury and the administration of C. asiatica, cinnamon, and spirulina. In addition, the variables were not normally distributed. Thus, the Spearman test was carried out and showed the correlation was very strong, with a value of r = 0.818 and P < 0.05. Conclusion: Based on histopathological findings from the brains of SD rats with TBI, pegagan, cinnamon, and spirulina will protect the brain (neuroprotective) in the acute phase.
