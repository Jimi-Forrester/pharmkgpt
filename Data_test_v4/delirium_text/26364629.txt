26364629|t|Synthesis and Preliminary Biological Evaluation of 1,3,5-Triazine Amino Acid Derivatives to Study Their MAO Inhibitors.
26364629|a|Three series of 4,6-dimethoxy-, 4,6-dipiperidino- and 4,6-dimorpholino-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl) amino acid derivatives were synthesized and characterized. A preliminary study for their monoamine oxidase inhibitory activity showed that compounds 7, 18, and 25 had MAO-A inhibition activity comparable to that of the standard clorgyline, with apparently more selective inhibitory activity toward MAO-A than MAO-B and no significant acute toxicity.
