35741054|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, affecting more than 50 million people worldwide with an estimated increase to 139 million people by 2050. The exact pathogenic mechanisms of AD remain elusive, resulting in the fact that the current therapeutics solely focus on symptomatic management instead of preventative or curative strategies. The two most widely accepted pathogenic mechanisms of AD include the amyloid and tau hypotheses. However, it is evident that these hypotheses cannot fully explain neuronal degeneration shown in AD. Substantial evidence is growing for the vital role of neuroinflammation in AD pathology. The neuroinflammatory hypothesis provides a new, exciting lead in uncovering the underlying mechanisms contributing to AD. This review aims to highlight new insights into the role of neuroinflammation in the pathogenesis of AD, mainly including the involvement of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kappaB), nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain, leucine-rich repeat-containing protein 3 (NLRP3)/caspase-1 axis, triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) and cGAS-STING as key influencers in augmenting AD development. The inflammasomes related to the pathways of NF-kappaB, NLRP3, TREM2, and cGAS-STING as biomarkers of the neuroinflammation associated with AD, as well as an overview of novel AD treatments based on these biomarkers as potential drug targets reported in the literature or under clinical trials, are explored.
