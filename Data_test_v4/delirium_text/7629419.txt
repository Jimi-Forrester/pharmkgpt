7629419|t|Reversible delirium in terminally ill patients.
7629419|a|Delirium is reported to be a common problem in terminally ill patients. The poor prognosis given to these patients may result in the failure to recognize the causes that are easily treated and may be reversible. We present four patients in whom a comprehensive assessment revealed a number of reversible causes of delirium, resulting in a treatment approach that significantly improved the patients' cognition and quality of life.
