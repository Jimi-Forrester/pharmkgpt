26557287|t|How is total antioxidant status in plasma of Patients with brucellosis?
26557287|a|BACKGROUND: Brucella species can cause infection in a wide range of animals and human beings. Oxidative events against brucella infection are not well elucidated. It is possible that brucellosis may be related to increased free radical production and antioxidant depletion. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine the total antioxidant capacity (TAC) before and after treatment of patients with brucellosis. METHODS: In the present study, a total of 48 patients with brucellosis, 23 males and 25 females, were detected through Wright >=1/160 2ME >=1/80, in association with compatible clinical findings. All patients were treated with standard regimens of therapy. Total antioxidant capacity (TAC) was determined with ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) using spectrophotometric method before and after treatment. RESULTS: TAC levels were significantly lower in pre-treatment than in post-treatment patients, 0.783+-0.015 and 0.819+-0.024 m mol/L respectively (p<0.01). There was not significant relation between plasma TAC levels and age or gender of the patients. CONCLUSION: TAC may be useful as an early marker of oxidative stress to monitor and optimize antioxidant therapy as an adjunct in the management of patients with brucellosis.
