33564485|t|Amitriptyline Dependence and Its Associations: A Case Report and Literature Review.
33564485|a|Amitriptyline, the second antidepressant invented next to imipramine, is indicated in many psychiatric conditions as well as for some organic disorders. The drug acts by increasing the availability of monoamines in the central nervous system postsynaptic clefts. Amitriptyline has long been suspected for abusive potential based on a few case reports, and the reports add evidence in favor of the hypothesis. This case report brings such material to the arena of evidence and discusses the probable mechanisms by which patients turn to abusing and be addicted to the drug. The article also argues matters associated with drug dispensing that might raise the risk of misuse of the drug, especially in countries where strict legislation for accessibility of prescribed drugs is not in practice.
