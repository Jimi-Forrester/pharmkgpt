36136647|t|West Nile Disease Symptoms and Comorbidities: A Systematic Review and Analysis of Cases.
36136647|a|West Nile virus (WNV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that has emerged as a major cause of viral encephalitis and meningitis, rarely leading to death. Several risk factors have been discussed in the past concerning the severity of the disease, while few reports have focused on precipitating conditions that determine of WNV-related death. Studies on cohorts of patients suffering of West Nile disease (WND) usually encompass low numbers of deceased patients as a result of the rarity of the event. In this systematic review and critical analysis of 428 published case studies and case series, we sought to evaluate and highlight critical parameters of WND-related death. We summarized the symptoms, comorbidities, and treatment strategies related to WND in all published cases of patients that included clinical features. Symptoms such as altered mental status and renal problems presented increased incidence among deceased patients, while these patients presented increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) glucose. Our analysis also highlights underestimated comorbidities such as pulmonary disease to act as precipitating conditions in WND, as they were significantly increased amongst deceased patients. CSF glucose and the role of pulmonary diseases need to be revaluated either retrospectively or prospectively in WND patient cohorts, as they may be linked to increased mortality risk.
