Kaixin San (KXS), is a classic prescription for the treatment of memory decline and applied for AD nowadays. However, the quality-markers of KXS for the treatment of AD remain unclear. PURPOSE: To investigate the effects and potential quality-markers of KXS against an APP/PS1 transgenic mouse model of AD. METHODS: Two month old APP/PS1 transgenic model mice of AD were orally given KXS for 10 month to intervene. Through the novel object recognition (NOR), the classic Morris water maze (MWM), immunohistochemistry detection of Abeta1-42, Hematoxylin-eosin staining (HE), blood metabolic profiling evaluated the therapeutic effect of KXS on AD. PCMS software was applied to analysis correlations between biomarkers and serum constituents and became a powerful tool for excavating effective material basis. Behavior, histopathology and Chinmedomics were applied for assessing the efficacy and discovering potential quality-markers. RESULTS: The result of MWM showed oral KXS could shorten the escape latency and increased the times of crossing the platform. The result of NOR showed oral KXS increased discrimination index (DI). Though the histopathology, KXS reduced the necrosis of neuron in brain tissue and the deposition of Abeta1-42. Chinmedomics strategy was used to analyze the biomarkers and blood components. KXS called back 20 biomarkers of AD. The effective material basis of KXS was ginsenoside Rf, ginsenoside F1, 20-O-glucopyranosyl ginsenoside Rf, dehydropachymic acid and E-3, 4, 5-trimethoxycinnamic acid. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrate that KXS significantly improved cognitive function of transgenic mice of AD, repaired the damage caused by Abeta, regulated amino acid metabolism and lipid metabolism abnormalities and determined the effective material basis of KXS treating AD. Clarifying the quality-markers of KXS can establish scientific quality standard to reflect the safety and effectiveness of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM).
