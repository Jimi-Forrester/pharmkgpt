38519576|t|Role of folate receptor alpha in the partial rejuvenation of dentate gyrus cells: Improvement of cognitive function in 21-month-old aged mice.
38519576|a|Neuronal aging may be, in part, related to a change in DNA methylation. Thus, methyl donors, like folate and methionine, may play a role in cognitive changes associated to neuronal aging. To test the role of these metabolites, we performed stereotaxic microinjection of these molecules into the dentate gyrus (DG) of aged mice (an average age of 21 month). Folate, but not S-Adenosyl-Methionine (SAM), enhances cognition in aged mice. In the presence of folate, we observed partial rejuvenation of DG cells, characterized by the expression of juvenile genes or reorganization of extracellular matrix. Here, we have also tried to identify the mechanism independent of DNA methylation, that involve folate effects on cognition. Our analyses indicated that folate binds to folate receptor alpha (FRalpha) and, upon folate binding, FRalpha is transported to cell nucleus, where it is acting as transcription factor for expressing genes like SOX2 or GluN2B. In this work, we report that a FRalpha binding peptide also replicates the folate effect on cognition, in aged mice. Our data suggest that such effect is not sex-dependent. Thus, we propose the use of this peptide to improve cognition since it lacks of folate-mediated side effects. The use of synthetic FRalpha binding peptides emerge as a future strategy for the study of brain rejuvenation.
