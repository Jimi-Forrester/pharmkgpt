38646272|t|Post-COVID-19 Neurological Sequelae of Polyneuropathy and Encephalitis: A Comprehensive Case Report.
38646272|a|Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, commonly known as COVID-19, has been associated with various neurological complications. However, the mechanisms underlying these neurological manifestations remain incompletely understood. We present a case of a 63-year-old male who was admitted to the intensive care unit with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Following recovery from respiratory symptoms, he was found to have weakness in the limbs. Months later, he also developed altered mental status, hallucinations, and behavioral changes. Neurological examination revealed signs consistent with polyneuropathy and autoimmune encephalitis. Further investigations, including nerve conduction studies, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, and response to steroids, supported the diagnosis of COVID-19-related polyneuropathy and autoimmune encephalitis. This is a rare presentation of COVID-19 and has only been described in a few case reports. Further research is warranted to elucidate the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying neurological sequelae of COVID-19 and to develop targeted therapeutic strategies.
