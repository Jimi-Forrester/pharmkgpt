36037514|a|STUDY OBJECTIVES: Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with abnormalities of sleep macro- and microstructure as measured using polysomnography (PSG). Whether these abnormalities precede the development of PD is unknown. This study investigated the association between PSG measured sleep abnormalities in older adults and the risk of incident PD. METHODS: A total of 2,770 men from the ancillary sleep study of the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men Study (MrOS), a population-based cohort from the United States, who were free from PD baseline and underwent overnight PSG, were included in this longitudinal analysis. Incident PD was based on a clinical diagnosis from a medical professional. Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (OR) for incident PD by quartiles of PSG measures, with adjustment for sociodemographic characteristics, medical comorbidities, and lifestyle factors. RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 9.8 years, 70 (2.5%) cases of incident PD were identified. Longer total sleep time, lower rapid eye movement sleep (REM) percentage, a lower alpha/theta ratio during non-REM sleep and higher minimum oxygen saturations during REM sleep, were each associated with an increased risk of developing PD. Conversely, a higher awakening index was associated with a decreased risk of developing PD. The OR for the highest risk quartiles compared to the lowest risk quartiles, ranged from 2.1 to 3.7 (p's < .05). The associations remained significant when cases occurring within the first two years of follow-up were excluded from the analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Macro- and micro-structural sleep abnormalities precede the development of PD by several years and can identify individuals at high risk of developing PD in the future.
