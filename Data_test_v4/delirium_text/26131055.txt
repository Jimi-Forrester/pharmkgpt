26131055|t|Roles of sigma-1 receptors in Alzheimer's disease.
26131055|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder and the leading cause of senile dementia all over the world. Still no existing drugs can effectively reverse the cognitive impairment. However, Sigma-1 (sigma-1) receptors have been long implicated in multiple neurological and psychiatric conditions over these years. In this review, we discuss the current understanding of sigma-1 receptor functions. Through regulation of lipid rafts, secretases, kinases, neuroceptors and ion channels, sigma-1 receptors can influence cellular signal transduction, TCA cycle, oxidative stress, neuron plasticity and neurotransmitter release etc. Based on this, we suggest the key cellular mechanisms linking sigma-1 receptor to Alzheimer's disease. Besides, we detail the evidences showing that sigma-1 receptors agonists, being the promising compounds for treatment of cognitive dysfunction, exhibit robust neuroprotection and anti-amnesia effect against Abeta neurotoxicity in the progress of Alzheimer's disease. The evidence comes from animal models, preclinical studies in humans and full clinical trials. In addition, the questions to be solved regarding this receptor are also presented. When concerned with NMDAR, sigma-1 receptor activation may result in two totally different influences on AD. Utilization of sigma-1 agents early in AD remains an overlooked therapeutic opportunity. This article may pave the way for further studies about sigma-1 receptor on Alzheimer's disease.
