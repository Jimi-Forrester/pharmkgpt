35559699|a|INTRODUCTION: This study evaluated the prevalence of transurethral catheter self-removal in critically-ill COVID-19 non-sedated adult patients compared with non-COVID-19 controls. METHODS: COVID-19 patients who self-extracted transurethral or suprapubic catheters needing a urological intervention were prospectively included (group A). Demographic data, medical and nursing records, comorbidities and nervous system symptoms were evaluated. Agitation, anxiety and delirium were assessed by the Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale (RASS). The control group B were non-COVID-19 patients who self-extracted transurethral/suprapubic catheter in a urology unit (subgroup B1) and geriatric unit (subgroup B2), requiring a urological intervention in the same period. RESULTS: 37 men and 11 women were enrolled in group A. Mean RASS score was 3.1 +- 1.8. There were 5 patients in subgroup B1 and 11 in subgroup B2. Chronic comorbidities were more frequent in group B than the COVID-19 group (P<0.01). COVID-19 patients had a significant difference in RASS score (P<0.006) and catheter self-extraction events (P<0.001). Complications caused by traumatic catheter extractions (severe urethrorrhagia, longer hospital stay) were greater in COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION: This is the first study focusing on the prevalence and complications of catheter self-removal in COVID-19 patients. An increased prevalence of urological complications due to agitation and delirium related to COVID-19 has been demonstrated-the neurological sequelae of COVID-19 must be considered during hospitalisation.
