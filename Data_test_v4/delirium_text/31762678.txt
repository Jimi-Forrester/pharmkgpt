31762678|a|Cyanobacteria are the rich resource of various secondary metabolites including toxins with broad pharmaceutical significance. The aim of this work was to evaluate the antiproliferative, neurotoxic, genotoxic and mutagenic effects of cyanobacterial extracts containing Microcystin-LR (MCLR) in vitro. ELISA analysis results showed that MCLR contents of five cyanobacterial extracts were 2.07 ng/mL, 1.43 ng/mL, 1.41 ng/mL, 1.27 ng/mL, and 1.12 ng/mL for Leptolyngbya sp. SB1, Phormidium sp. SB4, Oscillatoria earlei SB5, Phormidium sp. SB2, Uncultured cyanobacterium, respectively. Phormidium sp. SB4 and Phormidium sp. SB2 extracts had the lowest neurotoxicity (86% and 79% cell viability, respectively) and Oscillatoria earlei SB5 extracts had the highest neurotoxicity (47% cell viability) on PC12 cell at 1000 microg/ml extract concentration. Leptolyngbya sp. SB1 and Phormidium sp. SB2 showed the highest antiproliferative effect (92% and 77% cell death) on HT29 cell. On the other hand, all concentrations of five toxic cyanobacterial extracts induced DNA damage between 3.0% and 1.3% of tail intensity and did not cause any direct mutagenic effect at the 1000 microg/plate cyanobacterial extracts. These results suggest that cyanobacteria-derived MCLR is a promising candidate for development of effective agents against colon cancer.
