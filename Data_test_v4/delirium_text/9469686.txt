9469686|t|Therapeutic considerations in the management of agitated or delirious critically ill patients.
9469686|a|Agitation and delirium in the critical care unit are common problems that at times are difficult to treat. The difficulty stems from few placebo-controlled or even blinded trials evaluating various therapies. In addition, the literature in these areas is scattered through various journals in a variety of disciplines. Pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic techniques may achieve the therapeutic objective for these patients. Since no one drug will achieve the goals in every patient, therapy must be tailored to the characteristics and needs of each individual.
