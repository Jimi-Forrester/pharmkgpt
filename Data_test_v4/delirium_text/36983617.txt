36983617|t|Emergence from General Anaesthesia: Can We Discriminate between Emergence Delirium and Postoperative Pain?
36983617|a|Unsettled behaviors characterize the early phase after general anaesthesia in the pediatric population in up to 80% of cases. Emergence delirium (ED) and acute pain are the two most relevant sources of this phenomenon. Research and clinical guidelines are difficult to implement due to the variability of the definition of unsettled behavior and measurement of the different components. The most probable incidence of ED is between 10% and 20%, and the potential risk factors could be summarized as young age, male gender, preoperative anxiety, baseline sleep-disordered breathing, volatile anaesthesia and ENT or ophthalmologic surgery. Self-reporting behavioral and observational scales are unable to reliably differentiate between ED and pain in a child who is not fully awake, making correct treatment choices difficult. This may lead to an undertreatment of pain in agitated children or to the overuse of opioids for self-limiting ED. This paper considers the current knowledge on the identification and treatment of ED and pain and provides a pragmatic approach for daily practice.
