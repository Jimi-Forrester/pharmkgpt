32675416|a|BACKGROUND: The Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander (AANHPI) aging population is rapidly growing and the burden of Alzheimer's disease and its related dementias (ADRD) will likely mirror this demographic growth. AANHPIs face significant barriers in obtaining timely ADRD diagnosis and services; yet little is known about ADRD in this population. OBJECTIVE: The study objective is to conduct a systematic review on the published literature on ADRD among AANHPIs to identify gaps and priorities to inform future research and action plans. METHODS: The systematic review was conducted following the PRISMA Protocol for Systematic Reviews. Co-author (TR), an experienced Medical Librarian, searched PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Cochrane Central of Clinical Trials, Ageline, and Web of Science for peer-reviewed articles describing ADRD among AANHPIs. The search was not limited by language or publication date. Each citation was reviewed by two trained independent reviewers. Conflicts were resolved through consensus. RESULTS: The title/abstract and full texts of 1,447 unique articles were screened for inclusion, yielding 168 articles for analysis. Major research topics included prevalence, risk factors, comorbidities, interventions and outreach, knowledge and attitudes, caregiving, and detection tools. A limited number of studies reported on national data, on NHPI communities generally, and on efficacy of interventions targeting AANHPI communities. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review on ADRD among AANHPI populations. Our review provides a first step in mapping the extant literature on ADRD among this underserved and under-researched population and will serve as a guide for future research, policy, and intervention.
