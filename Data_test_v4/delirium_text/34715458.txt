34715458|a|BACKGROUND: Globally, lifestyles have changed to prevent the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Therefore, we aimed to understand health and lifestyle conditions associated with frailty transition over 6 months and devise a method for identifying frailty among community-dwelling older people during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: This community-based prospective cohort study was conducted from May to July 2020 (baseline) and November 2020 to January 2021 (follow-up) in Japan, with 1,953 community-dwelling older people (>=65 years) at baseline. To identify transition from non-frailty at baseline to frailty at follow-up, the Frailty Screening Index was used. For predicting frailty transition, two self-reported questionnaires assessing health and lifestyle conditions were employed. RESULTS: Overall, 706 individuals returned the baseline and follow-up questionnaires. Among the 492 non-frail older people at baseline, there was a 9.8% increase in frailty transition. The adjusted model for frailty transition by age, sex, multimorbidity, and living arrangements indicated that forgetfulness (odds ratio [OR] 2.74, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.00 to 7.51), falls in the past year (OR 2.26, 95% CI: 1.08 to 4.74), and subjective leg muscle weakness (OR 1.83, 95% CI: 1.05 to 3.21) were predictors of frailty transition. The combination of age >=75 years and subjective leg muscle weakness showed moderate sensitivity, specificity, and % accuracy (0.688, 0.696, and 69.5%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Approximately 10% of older people showed new transitions to frailty over 6 months during the COVID-19 pandemic. A combination of age and subjective leg muscle weakness is a feasible measure to optimally identify frailty transition.
