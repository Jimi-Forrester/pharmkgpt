39893547|t|Mining and disproportionality analysis of adverse events signals for naltrexone based on real-world data from the FAERS database.
39893547|a|BACKGROUND: This study aims to analyze adverse events (AEs)associated with naltrexone based on the FAERS database, providing a foundationfor its safety monitoring. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Disproportionality analysis methods,including Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR), Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR),Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN), and Multi-Item GammaPoisson Shrinker (MGPS) algorithms, were employed to quantify signals ofnaltrexone-related AEs. RESULTS: AEs related to naltrexone from the first quarter of 2013 to the fourth quarter of2023 were extracted from the FAERS database for detailed analysis. Among atotal of 41,757,311 reports 28,745 were directly associated with naltrexone,involving 27 organ systems. We identified 110 positive signals for AEsat the preferred term (PT) level using disproportionality analysis,whichincluded known AEs such as agitation, depressed mood, sleep disorder,tremor, delirium, and decreased libido. Additionally, our findings suggestedpotential risks of restless legs syndrome, eosinophilic pneumonia, andotolithiasis, which were not mentioned in the drug's label, therebysupplementing the existing safety information. CONCLUSIONS: The analysis of the FAERS database identified AEsassociated with naltrexone, contributing to the awareness of clinicalpractitioners and pharmacists regarding the drug-related risk signals.Thisawareness facilitates timely preventive and therapeutic measures, ensuringpatient safety.
