27239537|a|INTRODUCTION: We investigate whether longitudinal callosal atrophy could predict conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: Longitudinal (baseline + 1-year follow-up) MRI scans of 132 MCI subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative were used. A total of 54 subjects did not convert to AD over an average (+-SD) follow-up of 5.46 (+-1.63) years, whereas 78 converted to AD with an average conversion time of 2.56 (+-1.65) years. Annual change in the corpus callosum thickness profile was calculated from the baseline and 1-year follow-up MRI. A logistic regression model with fused lasso regularization for prediction was applied to the annual changes. RESULTS: We found a sex difference. The accuracy of prediction was 84% in females and 61% in males. The discriminating regions of corpus callosum differed between sexes. In females, the genu, rostrum, and posterior body had predictive power, whereas the genu and splenium were relevant in males. DISCUSSION: Annual callosal atrophy predicts MCI-to-AD conversion in females more accurately than in males.
