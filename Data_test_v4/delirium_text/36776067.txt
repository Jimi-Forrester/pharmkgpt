36776067|a|BACKGROUND: Suppressor of tumorgenicity 2 (ST2) is highly expressed in brain tissue and is a receptor for interleukin 33 (IL-33). ST2 exists in two forms, a transmembrane receptor (ST2L) and a soluble decoy receptor (sST2). IL-33 binds to ST2L, triggering downstream signaling pathways involved in amyloid plaque clearance. Conversely, sST2 binds competitively to IL-33, attenuating its neuroprotective effects. High sST2 levels have been reported in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), suggesting that the IL-33/ST2 signaling pathway may be implicated in neurodegenerative diseases. OBJECTIVE: To investigate plasma sST2 levels in controls and patients with MCI, AD, frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and Parkinson's disease (PD). METHODS: Plasma sST2 levels were measured using ELISA in 397 subjects (91 HC, 46 MCI, 38 AD, 28 FTD, and 194 PD). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of sST2 were measured in 22 subjects. Relationship between sST2 and clinical outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: Plasma sST2 levels were increased across all disease groups compared to controls, with highest levels seen in FTD followed by AD and PD. Dementia patients with higher sST2 had lower cross-sectional cognitive scores in Frontal Assessment Battery and Digit Span Backward. At baseline, PD-MCI patients had higher sST2, associated with worse attention. In the longitudinal PD cohort, higher sST2 significantly associated with decline in global cognition and visuospatial domains. Plasma sST2 levels correlated with CSF sST2 levels. CONCLUSION: Plasma sST2 is raised across neurodegenerative diseases and is associated with poorer cognition. Higher baseline sST2 is a potential biomarker of disease severity in neurodegeneration.
