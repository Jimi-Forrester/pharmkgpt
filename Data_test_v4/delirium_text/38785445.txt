38785445|t|Cardiovascular Disease and Dementia: Exploring Intersections, Risks, and Therapeutic Challenges.
38785445|a|This review examines the complex bidirectional relationship between cardiovascular disease and various dementia subtypes, including Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia, and frontotemporal dementia. Traditional cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, coronary artery disease, arrhythmia, and diabetes mellitus are strongly linked to the development of dementia. Emerging evidence indicates that cognitive decline can exacerbate cardiovascular risks through heightened inflammatory responses and compromised autonomic regulation. Additionally, this review explores trials that investigate the impact of cardiovascular medications, such as antihypertensive and statin therapies, on cognitive outcomes, as well as studies examining how dementia treatments like anticholinesterases affect cardiovascular health. This review emphasizes the importance of early identification of at-risk individuals, integrated care approaches, and lifestyle interventions aimed at reducing both cardiovascular disease and dementia risk, ultimately aiming to enhance patient outcomes and quality of life.
