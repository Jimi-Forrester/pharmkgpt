30984815|a|INTRODUCTION: We examined the influence of common preanalytical factors on the measurement of Alzheimer's disease-specific biomarkers in human plasma. METHODS: Amyloid beta peptides (Abeta[1-40], Abeta[1-42]) and total Tau plasma concentrations were quantified using fully automated Roche Elecsys assays. RESULTS: Abeta(1-40), Abeta(1-42), and total Tau plasma concentrations were not affected by up to three freeze/thaw cycles, up to five tube transfers, the collection tube material, or the size; circadian rhythm had a minor effect. All three biomarkers were influenced by the anticoagulant used, particularly total Tau. Abeta concentrations began decreasing 1 hour after blood draw/before centrifugation and decreased by up to 5% and 10% at 2 and 6 hours, respectively. For separated plasma, time to measurement influenced Abeta levels by up to 7% after 6 hours and 10% after 24 hours. DISCUSSION: Our findings provide guidance for standardizing blood sample collection, handling, and storage to ensure reliable analysis of Alzheimer's disease plasma biomarkers in routine practice and clinical trials.
