36770774|a|Since the number of people with Alzheimer's disease (AD) continues to rise, new and effective drugs are urgently needed to not only slow down the progression of the disease, but to stop or even prevent its development. Serotonin 5-HT6 receptor (5-HT6R) ligands are still a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of AD. 1,3,5-Triazine derivatives, as novel structures lacking an indole or a sulfone moiety, have proven to be potent ligands for this receptor. In present work, new derivatives of the compound MST4 (4-((2-isopropyl-5-methylphenoxy)methyl)-6-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1,3,5-triazin-2-amine), the potent 5-HT6R antagonist (Ki = 11 nM) with promising ADMET and in vivo properties, were designed. The synthesized compounds were tested for their affinity towards 5-HT6R and other receptor (off)targets (serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT7 and dopamine D2). Based on the new results, 4-(2-tert-butylphenoxy)-6-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1,3,5-triazin-2-amine (3) was selected for extended in vitro studies as a potent and selective 5-HT6R ligand (Ki = 13 nM). Its ability to permeate the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and its hepatotoxicity were evaluated. In addition, X-ray crystallography and solubility studies were also performed. The results obtained confirm that 6-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1,3,5-triazin-2-amine derivatives, especially compound 3, are promising structures for further pharmacological studies as 5-HT6R ligands.
