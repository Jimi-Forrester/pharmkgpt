27408521|a|OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence of delirium and coma in mechanically ventilated patients sedated with dexmedetomidine or propofol alone; to evaluate the hospital length of stay for both treatment groups; and to evaluate the level of sedation, adverse effects, and hospital outcomes. METHODS: Medical records were reviewed retrospectively for patients who were admitted to the medical or surgical intensive care units (ICUs) in a 591-bed teaching hospital and who received either dexmedetomidine or propofol alone for 24 hours or more for sedation. RESULTS: A total of 111 patients were included in the study, with 56 patients in the dexmedetomidine group and 55 patients in the propofol group. Results of the analysis showed that the propofol group had a higher prevalence of coma (43.6% versus 12.5%; P < 0.001). Dexmedetomidine patients had a longer median hospital length of stay of 23.5 days (interquartile range [IQR], 11.5-39.5 days) versus 15.0 days (IQR, 7.0-24.0 days; P = 0.01). The rates of delirium were similar in both groups, with 16% in dexmedetomidine-treated patients versus 20% in propofol-treated patients (P = 0.63). CONCLUSION: No difference in the prevalence of delirium was found when comparing the dexmedetomidine- and propofol-treated groups. Propofol was associated with more coma and oversedation; dexmedetomidine was associated with longer time to extubation, longer length of stay in the ICU, and longer hospital length of stay.
