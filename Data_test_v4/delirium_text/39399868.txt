39399868|t|Post-diagnosis dementia care in the Western Pacific region: assessment of needs and pathways to optimal care.
39399868|a|The Western Pacific region is home to approximately 25% of the world's population. In the absence of cures for dementia, it is essential to focus on appropriate and accessible care pathways for people living with dementia and their families. This approach will ultimately result in timely diagnosis and improved care and support. Ensuring adequate dementia care and support pathways has been a longstanding issue in many developed countries and is becoming a more prominent issue in countries with rising dementia prevalence rates but comparatively limited health resources. This Viewpoint provides an overview of system-level post-diagnosis dementia care, from diagnosis to rehabilitation, across some of the region's lower (Laos, Solomon Islands, Philippines) and upper (China) middle income and high income (South Korea, Australia) countries. Gaps and challenges in post-diagnosis dementia care, as well as suggestions for optimal care, are discussed. This Viewpoint highlights highly variable system level post-diagnosis dementia care in the region.
