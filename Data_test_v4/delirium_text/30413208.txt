The objective of this study was to investigate the pathophysiology caused by particulate matter (PM) in the brain. We examined the effects of traffic-related particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of < 1 mum (PM1), high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA)-filtered air, and clean air on the brain structure, behavioral changes, brainwaves, and bioreactivity of the brain (cortex, cerebellum, and hippocampus), olfactory bulb, and serum after 3 and 6 months of whole-body exposure in 6-month-old Sprague Dawley rats. RESULTS: The rats were exposed to 16.3 +- 8.2 (4.7~ 68.8) mug/m3 of PM1 during the study period. An MRI analysis showed that whole-brain and hippocampal volumes increased with 3 and 6 months of PM1 exposure. A short-term memory deficiency occurred with 3 months of exposure to PM1 as determined by a novel object recognition (NOR) task, but there were no significant changes in motor functions. There were no changes in frequency bands or multiscale entropy of brainwaves. Exposure to 3 months of PM1 increased 8-isoporstance in the cortex, cerebellum, and hippocampus as well as hippocampal inflammation (interleukin (IL)-6), but not in the olfactory bulb. Systemic CCL11 (at 3 and 6 months) and IL-4 (at 6 months) increased after PM1 exposure. Light chain 3 (LC3) expression increased in the hippocampus after 6 months of exposure. Spongiosis and neuronal shrinkage were observed in the cortex, cerebellum, and hippocampus (neuronal shrinkage) after exposure to air pollution. Additionally, microabscesses were observed in the cortex after 6 months of PM1 exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Our study first observed cerebral edema and brain impairment in adult rats after chronic exposure to traffic-related air pollution.
