We sought to characterize the 10-year prevalence of cognitive impairment (i.e., mild cognitive impairment and dementia) and associated conditions in older female veterans. METHODS: Data were extracted from Veterans Health Administration medical records of 168,111 female veterans aged 65 and older. Cognitive impairment (CI) diagnoses were defined using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes or dementia medication prescriptions. Medical comorbidities and psychiatric conditions were determined using ICD-9 codes occurring within 2years of CI diagnosis or the last recorded medical encounter for veterans without CI. RESULTS: Ten-year prevalence was 1.8% (3,075) for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) diagnoses and 8.1% (13,653) for dementia diagnoses. Prevalence increased with age (MCI age 65: 1.4%; age 85+: 2.7%; dementia age 65: 2.5%; age 85+: 17.7%); 37.3% had dementia subtype diagnoses, with Alzheimer's disease being the most prevalent (72.7%). 47.7% of veterans with CI had at least one medical comorbidity, whereas 22.5% had at least one psychiatric condition. CONCLUSION: Few studies have characterized the prevalence of cognitive impairment in female veterans despite the expected increases in CI and impending demographic shifts in the military. The high prevalence of medical and psychiatric conditions in female veterans with CI highlights their healthcare burden and emphasizes the need for further investigations into the prevention, treatment, and care of cognitive impairment in this understudied population.
