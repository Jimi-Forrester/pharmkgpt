37790363|a|Microglia diversity emerges from interactions between intrinsic genetic programs and environment-derived signals, but how these processes unfold and interact in the developing brain remains unclear. Here, we show that radial glia-expressed integrin beta 8 (ITGB8) expressed in radial glia progenitors activates microglia-expressed TGFbeta1, permitting microglial development. Domain-restricted deletion of Itgb8 in these progenitors establishes complementary regions with developmentally arrested "dysmature" microglia that persist into adulthood. In the absence of autocrine TGFbeta1 signaling, we find that microglia adopt a similar dysmature phenotype, leading to neuromotor symptoms almost identical to Itgb8 mutant mice. In contrast, microglia lacking the TGFbeta signal transducers Smad2 and Smad3 have a less polarized dysmature phenotype and correspondingly less severe neuromotor dysfunction. Finally, we show that non-canonical (Smad-independent) signaling partially suppresses disease and development associated gene expression, providing compelling evidence for the adoption of microglial developmental signaling pathways in the context of injury or disease.
