31938596|t|Common Cognitive Biases in Nephrology Critical Care: A Plea for Metacognition.
31938596|a|The intensive care unit (ICU) is an incredibly complex environment, and ICU rounds are mentally taxing. The cognitive biases that tend to arise in mentally taxing environments such as the ICU pose a risk to patients. This review discusses 10 common cognitive biases and logical fallacies using examples in Nephrology Critical Care. Our objective is to promote metacognition (i.e., an awareness of one's cognition) among physicians. A state of metacognition is not a panacea, but aspiring for metacognition allows the critical care physician to improve chances for optimal patient outcomes.
