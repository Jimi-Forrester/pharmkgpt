28074801|t|Delirium after cardiac surgery: A pilot study from a single tertiary referral center.
28074801|a|BACKGROUND: Advances in cardiac surgery has shifted paradigm of management to perioperative psychological illnesses. Delirium is a state of altered consciousness with easy distraction of thoughts. The pathophysiology of this complication is not clear, but identification of risk factors is important for positive postoperative outcomes. The goal of the present study was to prospectively identify the incidence, motoric subtypes, and risk factors associated with development of delirium in cardiac surgical patients admitted to postoperative cardiac intensive care, using a validated delirium monitoring instrument. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a prospective, observational study. This study included 120 patients of age 18-80 years, admitted to undergo cardiac surgery after applying inclusion and exclusion criteria. Specific preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative data for possible risk factors were obtained. Once in a day, assessment of delirium was done. Continuous variables were measured as mean +- standard deviation, whereas categorical variables were described as proportions. Differences between groups were analyzed using Student's t-test, Mann-Whitney U-test, or Chi-square test. Variables with a P < 0.1 were then used to develop a predictive model using stepwise logistic regression with bootstrapping. RESULTS: Delirium was seen in 17.5% patients. The majority of cases were of hypoactive delirium type (85.72%). Multiple risk factors were found to be associated with delirium, and when logistic regression with bootstrapping applied to these risk factors, five independent variables were detected. History of hypertension (relative risk [RR] =6.7857, P = 0.0003), carotid artery disease (RR = 4.5000, P < 0.0001) in the form of stroke or hemorrhage, noninvasive ventilation (NIV) use (RR = 5.0446, P < 0.0001), Intensive Care Unit (ICU) stay more than 10 days (RR = 3.1630, P = 0.0021), and poor postoperative pain control (RR = 2.4958, P = 0.0063) was associated with postcardiac surgical delirium. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who developed delirium had systemic disease in the form of hypertension and cerebrovascular disease. Delirium was seen in patients who had higher postoperative pain scores, longer ICU stay, and NIV use. This study can be used to develop a predictive tool for diagnosing postcardiac surgical delirium.
