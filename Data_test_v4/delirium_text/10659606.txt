10659606|a|The advances in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, mainly related to anticholinesterase drugs (tacrine, donepezil, metriphonate and rivastigmine) and the methodology of their application in clinical studies and in everyday neurologic practice are reviewed. Recent discoveries with the immunization with Abeta-42 of transgenic rats expressing a mutation related to Alzheimer's disease may lead to new possibilities of etiopathogenic treatments.
