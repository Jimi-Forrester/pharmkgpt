37920344|t|Acyl-caged rhodamines: photo-controlled and self-calibrated generation of acetyl radicals for neural function recovery in early AD mice.
37920344|a|The biological function of radicals is a broad continuum from signaling to killing. Yet, biomedical exploitation of radicals is largely restricted to the theme of healing-by-killing. To explore their potential in healing-by-signaling, robust radical generation methods are warranted. Acyl radicals are endogenous, exhibit facile chemistry and elicit matrix-dependent biological outcomes. Their implications in health and disease remain untapped, primarily due to the lack of a robust generation method with spatiotemporal specificity. Fusing the Norrish chemistry into the xanthene scaffold, we developed a novel general and modular molecular design strategy for photo-triggered generation of acyl radicals, i.e., acyl-caged rhodamine (ACR). A notable feature of ACR is the simultaneous release of a fluorescent probe for cell redox homeostasis allowing real-time monitoring of the biological outcome of acyl radicals. With a donor of the endogenous acetyl radical (ACR575a), we showcased its capability in precise and continuous modulation of the cell redox homeostasis from signaling to stress, and induction of a local oxidative burst to promote differentiation of neural stem cells (NSCs). Upon intracerebral-injection of ACR575a and subsequent fiber-optical activation, early AD mice exhibited enhanced differentiation of NSCs toward neurons, reduced formation of Abeta plaques, and significantly improved cognitive abilities, including learning and memory.
