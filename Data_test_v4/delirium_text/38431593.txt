38431593|a|BACKGROUND: Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is one of the leading causes of mortality in patients with critical care illness. Since obesity is highly prevalent, we wanted to study its impact on the outcomes of patients who develop VAP. METHODS: Using the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database from 2017 to 2020, we conducted a retrospective study of adult patients with a principal diagnosis of VAP with a secondary diagnosis with or without obesity according to 10th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) codes. Several demographics, including age, race, and gender, were analyzed. The primary endpoint was mortality, while the secondary endpoints included tracheostomy, length of stay in days, and patient charge in dollars. Multivariate logistic regression model analysis was used to adjust for confounders, with a p-value less than 0.05 considered statistically significant. RESULTS: The study included 3832 patients with VAP, 395 of whom had obesity. The mean age in both groups was around 58 years, and 68% of the group with obesity were females compared to 40% in females in the group without obesity. Statistically significant comorbidities in the obesity group included a Charlson Comorbidity Index score of three and above, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and sleep apnea. Rates and odds of mortality were not significantly higher in the collective obesity group 39 (10%) vs. 336 (8.5%), p-value 0.62, adjusted odds ratio 1.2, p-value 0.61). The rates and odds of tracheostomy were higher in the obesity group but not statistically significant. Obese patients were also found to have a longer hospitalization. Upon subanalysis of the data, no evidence of racial disparities was found in the care of VAP for both the obese and control groups. CONCLUSIONS: Obesity was not found to be an independent risk factor for worse outcomes in patients who develop VAP in the intensive care unit.
