35564708|t|Validation of the Spanish Version of the Double Knowledge Expectations and Received Knowledge Significant Other Scale for Informal Caregivers of People with Dementia (KESO-DEM/RKSO-DEM).
35564708|a|Dementia is associated with cognitive decline. Becoming an informal caregiver raises questions, requiring information and support from health professionals to guide home care. A multicenter, longitudinal study was carried out to validate the Spanish version of the double scale of expected and received knowledge for informal caregivers of people with dementia (KESO-DEM/RKSO-DEM), the analysis of the dimensional structure of the instrument, its validity and reliability, and temporary stability was carried out. An analysis of criterion and construct validity, internal consistency, and test-retest stability was performed. The evaluation of the interrelation between dimensions was statistically significant. Regarding internal consistency, the scale values were good both for the scale totals and for each dimension of knowledge, with Cronbach's alpha coefficients of 0.97. For criterion validity, all items showed temporal stability for both questionnaires (p < 0.05). The availability of a valid, reliable tool for the measurement of expected and received knowledge in caregivers of people with dementia allows an approach based on the real needs of the family and the patient. It is important to design care protocols for people with dementia that are adapted to their needs and expectations and to their non-curative treatment, to improve the emotional well-being of patients and informal caregivers.
