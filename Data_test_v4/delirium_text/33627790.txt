33627790|a|Brain aging is a natural process characterized by cognitive decline and memory loss. This impairment is related to mitochondrial dysfunction and has recently been linked to the accumulation of abnormal proteins in the hippocampus. Age-related mitochondrial dysfunction could be induced by modified forms of tau. Here, we demonstrated that phosphorylated tau at Ser 396/404 sites, epitope known as PHF-1, is increased in the hippocampus of aged mice at the same time that oxidative damage and mitochondrial dysfunction are observed. Most importantly, we showed that tau PHF-1 is located in hippocampal mitochondria and accumulates in the mitochondria of old mice. Finally, since two mitochondrial populations were found in neurons, we evaluated tau PHF-1 levels in both non-synaptic and synaptic mitochondria. Interestingly, our results revealed that tau PHF-1 accumulates primarily in synaptic mitochondria during aging, and immunogold electron microscopy and Proteinase K protection assays demonstrated that tau PHF-1 is located inside mitochondria. These results demonstrated the presence of phosphorylated tau at PHF-1 commonly related to tauopathy, inside the mitochondria from the hippocampus of healthy aged mice for the first time. Thus, this study strongly suggests that synaptic mitochondria could be damaged by tau PHF-1 accumulation inside this organelle, which in turn could result in synaptic mitochondrial dysfunction, contributing to synaptic failure and memory loss at an advanced age.
