34879482|t|Fascia iliaca block for hip fractures in the emergency department: meta-analysis with trial sequential analysis.
34879482|a|BACKGROUND: Fascia iliaca block (FICB) has been used to reduce pain and its impact on geriatric patients with hip fractures. OBJECTIVE: We conducted this meta-analysis to investigate the analgesic efficacy of this block in comparison to standard of care (SOC) when performed by non-anesthesiologist in the emergency department. METHODS: Search on PubMed, SCOPUS, EMBASE, Google Scholar and Cochrane database for randomized and quasi-randomized trials were performed. The primary outcome was to compare pain relief at rest at 2-4 h. The pain relief at various time intervals, reduction in opioid use, the incidence of nausea/ vomiting, delirium and length of hospital stay were the secondary outcomes studied. Trial Sequential Analysis (TSA) was performed for the primary outcome. RESULTS: Eleven trials comprising 895 patients were included in the meta-analysis. Patients receiving FICB had significant better pain relief at rest at 2-4 h with mean difference of 1.59 (95% CI, 0.59-2.59, p = 0.002) with I2 = 96%. However, the certainty of the evidence was low and TSA showed that the sample size could not reach the requisite information size. A significant difference in pain relief at rest and on movement started within 30 min and lasted till 4 h of the block. Use of FICB was associated with a significant reduction in post-procedure parenteral opioid consumption, nausea and vomiting and length of hospital stay. CONCLUSIONS: FICB is associated with significant pain relief both at rest and on movement lasting up to 4 h as well as a reduction in opioid requirement and associated nausea and vomiting in geriatric patients with hip fracture. However, the quality of evidence is low and additional trials are necessary.
