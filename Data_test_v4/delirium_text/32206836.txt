32206836|t|[Standards in medical treatment of burns].
32206836|a|Thermal injuries occur in every age group and are caused by flames, fluids, steam and direct contact. They are often trivialized but should actually be treated immediately to reduce secondary complications, such as infections and hypertrophic scars. Besides the pain, large wound areas are given priority. Surgical treatment is necessary if at least second degree (IIb) deep dermal burns are present. In this case the reconstructive surgeon has various techniques in the therapeutic armamentarium. Furthermore, in cases of severe burns a perioperative intensive care monitoring and treatment are obligatory as massive systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), shock, sepsis, organ failure, fluid resuscitation and complications, such as delirium and exacerbation of pain have been proven to negatively influence the outcome.
