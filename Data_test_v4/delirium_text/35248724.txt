35248724|t|Perioperative Esophagectomy Outcomes in Older Esophageal Cancer Patients in Two Different Time Eras.
35248724|a|To investigate perioperative outcomes of esophagectomies by age groups. Retrospective analysis of esophageal cancer patients undergoing esophagectomy from 2005 to 2020 at a single academic institution. Baseline characteristics and outcomes were analyzed by 3 age groups: <70, 70-79, and >=80 years-old. Sub-analysis was done for 2 time periods: 2005-2012 and 2013-2020. Of 1135 patients, 789 patients were <70, 294 were 70-79, and 52 were >=80 years-old. Tumor characteristics, and operative technique were similar, except positive longitudinal margins rates (all <3%) (P = 0.008). Older adults experienced increased complications (53.6% vs 69.7% vs 65.4% respectively; P < 0.001) attributable to grade II complications (41.4% vs 62.2% vs 63.5% respectively; P < 0.001). Hospital length of stay (LOS) and rehabilitation requirements were higher in older adults (both P < 0.05). 30-day readmissions, reoperation, and 30-day mortality rates (all <2%) showed no association with age group. Overall complications, LOS, discharge disposition and re-operative rates improved from 2005 to 2012 to 2013-2020 for all (P < 0.05). Increasing age was an independent risk factor for cardiovascular complications (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.23-2.46 for ages 70-79 and OR 2.7, 95% CI 1.37-5.10 for ages >=80 ), inpatient rehabilitation (OR 3.3, 95% CI 2.26-5.05 for ages 70-79 and OR 12.1 95% CI 5.83-25.04 for ages >=80), and prolonged LOS (OR 1.64 95% CI 1.16-2.31 for ages 70-79 and OR 3.6 95% CI 1.71-7.67 for >=80. After adjusting for time period, older age remained associated with complications (P < 0.05). Highly selected older adults at a large volume esophagectomy center can undergoesophagectomy with increased minor complication and rehabilitation needs.
