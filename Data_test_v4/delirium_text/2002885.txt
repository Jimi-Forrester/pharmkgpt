2002885|t|Platelet phospholipid synthesis in Alzheimer's disease.
2002885|a|The rates of incorporation of [3H]choline and [3H]ethanolamine into membrane phospholipids of platelets from 22 drug-free Alzheimer's disease patients and 18 normal elderly controls were compared. No significant differences between groups were found. If alterations in lipid metabolism are involved in the pathophysiological processes underlying Alzheimer's disease, such alterations are not manifest in measures of radiolabeled base incorporation into platelet phospholipids.
