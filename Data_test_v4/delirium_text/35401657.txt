35401657|t|The Genomic Architecture of Hidradenitis Suppurativa-A Systematic Review.
35401657|a|Hidradenitis suppurativa is a chronic, suppurative condition of the pilosebaceous unit manifesting as painful nodules, abscesses, and sinus tracts mostly in, but not limited to, intertriginous skin. Great strides have been made at elucidating the pathophysiology of hidradenitis suppurativa, which appears to be the product of hyperkeratinization and inflammation brought about by environmental factors and a genetic predisposition. The identification of familial hidradenitis suppurativa has sparked research aimed at identifying underlying pathogenic variants in patients who harbor them. The objective of this review is to provide a broad overview of the role of genetics in various aspects of hidradenitis suppurativa, specifically the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and clinical application.
