12436379|t|[Descriptive epidemiology of ambulatory neurological care in the Vega Baja (Alicante) area].
12436379|a|AIMS: The aim of our work is to analyse ambulatory neurological care in the area of Vega Baja, which is located in the province of Alicante (Spain), in order to find out: a) the demographic characteristics of the population that visits the neurologist; b) the motives that led to the visit; c) the diagnoses carried out. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective two year study of patients over the age of 14 sent to the Neurology department. The reasons for the visit were classified into 15 categories and the diagnoses were given a code according to the criteria set out in the International Classification of Diseases 9th edition. RESULTS: A total of 2,227 patients were included in the study. The annual incidence of first visits was 10.6 per 1,000 people. 60% of the patients were women. The average age was 51.6 years old. Headache was the most frequent reason for the visiting the doctor. One out of every three patients visited because of headache and/or facial pain. The five most frequent diagnoses in the under 65 group were, in descending order of frequency: migraine, tension type headache, epilepsy, syncope and anxiety. The five most common diagnoses in the over 65 group were, in descending order of frequency: Alzheimer, Parkinson, transitory cerebral ischemia, cerebral thrombosis and epilepsy. CONCLUSIONS: The type of ambulatory neurological pathology depends on the age of the patients, and thus we find that headache is prevalent in the younger patients whereas neurodegenerative and vascular pathological conditions are more common in those over the age of 65.
