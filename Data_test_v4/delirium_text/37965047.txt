Specifically, animal and human studies have revealed that in the early phase of Alzheimer's disease, there is an increased risk of seizures. It has also been demonstrated that the administration of anti-seizure medications can slow the functional progression of the disease only in patients with EEG signs of cortical hyperexcitability. In addition, although it is not known at what disease stage hyperexcitability emerges, there remains no consensus regarding the imaging and diagnostic methods best able to detect interictal events to further distinguish different phenotypes of Alzheimer's disease. In this exploratory work, we studied 13 subjects with amnestic mild cognitive impairment and 20 healthy controls using overnight high-density EEG with 256 channels. All participants also underwent MRI and neuropsychological assessment. Electronic source reconstruction was also used to better select and localize spikes. We found spikes in six of 13 (46%) amnestic mild cognitive impairment compared with two of 20 (10%) healthy control participants (P = 0.035), representing a spike prevalence similar to that detected in previous studies of patients with early-stage Alzheimer's disease. The interictal events were low-amplitude temporal spikes more prevalent during non-rapid eye movement sleep. No statistically significant differences were found in cognitive performance between amnestic mild cognitive impairment patients with and without spikes, but a trend in immediate and delayed memory was observed. Moreover, no imaging findings of cortical and subcortical atrophy were found between amnestic mild cognitive impairment participants with and without epileptiform spikes. In summary, our exploratory study shows that patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment reveal EEG signs of hyperexcitability early in the disease course, while no other significant differences in neuropsychological or imaging features were observed among the subgroups. If confirmed with longitudinal data, these exploratory findings could represent one of the first signatures of a preclinical epileptiform phenotype of amnestic mild cognitive impairment and its progression.
