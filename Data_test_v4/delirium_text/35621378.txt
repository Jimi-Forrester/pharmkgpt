35621378|t|Molecular docking and molecular dynamics approach to identify potential compounds in Huperzia squarrosa for treating Alzheimer's disease.
35621378|a|OBJECTIVES: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a lingering progressive neurodegenerative disorder that causes patients to lose cognitive function. The enzyme Acetylcholinesterase (AChE), Butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE), Monoamine oxidase A (MAO A), Beta-secretase cleavage enzyme (BACE 1) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors play an important role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, inhibiting enzymes is an effective method to treat Alzheimer disease. In this study, we evaluated in silico inhibitory effects of AChE, BuChE, MAO A, BACE 1 and NMDA enzyme of Huperzia squarrosa's compounds. METHODS: The three-dimensional (3D) of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (PDB ID: 1PBQ), enzyme beta-secretase 1 (PDB ID: 4X7I), enzyme monoamine oxidase A (PDB ID: 2Z5X), enzyme butyrylcholinesterase (PDB ID: 4BDS) and enzyme acetylcholinesterase (PDB ID: 1EVE) were retrieved from the Protein Data Bank RCSB. Molecular docking was done by Autodock vina software and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of the ligand-protein complex with the least binding energy pose was perfomed by MOE. Lipinski Rule of Five is used to compare compounds with drug-like and non-drug-like properties. Pharmacokinetic parameters of potential compounds were evaluated using the pkCSM tool. RESULTS: Based on previous publication of Huperzia squarrosa, we have collected 15 compounds. In these compounds, huperzine B, huperzinine, lycoposerramine U N-oxide, 12-epilycodine N-oxide showed strongly inhibit the five AChE, BuChE, MAO A, BACE 1 and NMDA targets for Alzheimer's treatment. Lipinski rule of five and ADMET predict have shown that four above compounds have drug-likeness properties, good absorption ability and cross the blood-brain barrier, which have the most potential to become drugs for the treatment of Alzheimer's in the future. Furthermore, MD study showed that huperzine B and huperzinine have stability of the docking pose with NMDA target. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we found two natural compounds in Huperzia squarrosa including Huperzine B and Huperzinine have drug-likeness properties, good absorption ability and cross the blood-brain barrier, which have potential to become drugs for the treatment of Alzheimer's in the future.
