38214255|t|Infection, Inflammation, and Poststroke Cognitive Impairment.
38214255|a|BACKGROUND: Infection and inflammation are dementia risk factors in population-based cohorts; however, studies in stroke are scarce. We determined the prevalence of infection after stroke and routinely measured inflammatory biomarkers during hospitalization and their associations with acute and 6-month cognitive impairment. METHODS AND RESULTS: A prospective stroke cohort completed the Oxford Cognitive Screen at <=2 weeks and 6 months after stroke. Infection, inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, white cell count, and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio), and systemic inflammatory response syndrome were ascertained throughout admission with electronic patient records supplemented by hand searches. Associations with acute and 6-month global and domain-specific cognitive impairment were analyzed using multivariable regression, adjusting for demographic/vascular factors and stroke severity. Among 255 patients (mean age, 73.9 [SD, 12.6] years; 46.3% women; mean education, 12.6 [SD, 3.7] years; median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score 5 [range, minimum-maximum, 0-30]), infection was present in 90 patients (35.3%) at mean 4.4 (SD, 6.9) days after stroke, consisting predominantly of pneumonia (47/90; 52%) and urinary tract infection (39/90; 43%). Admission white cell count was elevated in 25.1% (n=64; mean, 9.5x109/L [SD, 3.2x109/L]), C-reactive protein in 41.2% (n=105; mean, 27.5 [SD, 50.9 mg/L]), neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio in 55.7% (n=97; mean, 5.5 [SD, 4.5]), and systemic inflammatory response syndrome in 26.6% (n=53 [45.2%] positive during hospitalization). Infection was associated with acute and 6-month poststroke cognitive impairment (P<0.05adj) with stronger associations acutely for severe infection (infection+systemic inflammatory response syndrome; P=0.03adj). Acute language, executive function and attention domain impairments, and 6-month number processing impairment were associated with infection (P<0.05adj). No significant relationships were found for any biomarker and cognitive impairment. CONCLUSIONS: Infection and elevations in routinely measured inflammatory biomarkers are common following stroke; however, only infection is associated with poststroke cognitive impairment, suggesting that increases in these biomarkers may be nonspecific. Infection may present a tractable target for reducing poststroke cognitive impairment.
