11059261|a|Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of memory disruption in elderly people. The main pathogenic factor of the disease is beta-amyloid protein, which may cause toxic damage of neurones. Other suggested pathogenic factors include an inflammatory process around the senile plaques, apoptosis and necrotic death of neurones, and, in consequence, changes in functioning of neurotransmitter systems. In this article the authors present the main directions in pharmacotherapy of Alzheimer's disease: causal therapy, which prevents the neurodegenerative changes and slows down the pathogenetic process, and symptomatic therapy. The aim of symptomatic therapy is to reduce memory disruption and psychiatric symptoms associated with the disease. Positive influence on cognitive processes is exerted by cholinergic drugs, e.g. the actually used inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase (rivastigmine, donepezil), the nootropic agents (piracetam, nefiracetam) and extracts of Gingko biloba. For treatment of the disease accompanying psychiatric symptoms (anxiety, depression, hallucinations, sleepness) the drugs with minimal influence on cognitive processes are recommended. Attempts at causal therapy are focussed on searching for the substances that can prevent the formation and toxicity of beta-amyloid (droloksifen, estrogens, agonists of muscarinic receptors M1), the cytotoxic influence of excitatory aminoacids (memantine, lamotrigine), calcium (nimodipine) and free radicals (selegiline, alpha-tocoferol), and the development of inflammatory process (non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs). The new target of research is correction of deficits of nerve growth factor and neurotransmitters by intracerebral implantation of modified fibroblasts. Another way is prevention of the formation of amyloid plaques using appropriate antisense oligonucleotides.
