38027460|t|Altered gait parameters in distracted walking: a bio-evolutionary and prognostic health perspective on passive listening and active responding during cell phone use.
38027460|a|The underpinnings of bipedal gait are reviewed from an evolutionary biology and prognostic health perspective to better understand issues and concerns related to cell phone use during ambulation and under conditions of distraction and interference. We also consider gait-related health issues associated with the fear of or risk of falling and include prognostic dimensions associated with cognitive decline, dementia, and mortality. Data were acquired on 21 healthy young adults without hearing loss, vestibular, balance, otological or neurological dysfunction using a computerized walkway (GAITRite  Walkway System) combined with specialized software algorithms to extract gait parameters. Four experimental conditions and seven temporo-spatial gait parameters were studied: gait velocity, cadence, stride length, ambulatory time, single-support time, double-support time, and step count. Significant main effects were observed for ambulation time, velocity, stride velocity, and double-support time. The greatest impact of distraction and interference occurred during the texting condition, although other significant effects occurred when participants were verbally responding to queries and passively listening to a story. These experimental observations show that relatively simple distraction and interference tasks implemented through the auditory sensory modality can induce significant perturbations in gait while individuals were ambulating and using a cell phone. Herein, emphasis is placed on the use of quantifiable gait parameters in medical, psychological, and audiological examinations to serve as a foundation for identifying and potentially averting gait-related disturbances.
