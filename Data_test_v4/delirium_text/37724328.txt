37724328|t|Crosstalk between bone and other organs.
37724328|a|Bone has long been considered as a silent organ that provides a reservoir of calcium and phosphorus, traditionally. Recently, further study of bone has revealed additional functions as an endocrine organ connecting systemic organs of the whole body. Communication between bone and other organs participates in most physiological and pathological events and is responsible for the maintenance of homeostasis. Here, we present an overview of the crosstalk between bone and other organs. Furthermore, we describe the factors mediating the crosstalk and review the mechanisms in the development of potential associated diseases. These connections shed new light on the pathogenesis of systemic diseases and provide novel potential targets for the treatment of systemic diseases.
