23717767|a|BACKGROUND: Ginger (Zingiber officinale Rosc.) belongs to the family Zingiberaceae. The health-promoting perspective of ginger is attributed to its rich phytochemistry. This study aimed to review the current evidence on ginger effects as an anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE for related publications using "ginger" and "anti-oxidative" and "ginger" and "anti-inflammatory" as keywords. This search had considered Papers that had been published between 2000 and 2010 without any filter. CONCLUSIONS: The anticancer potential of ginger is well documented and its functional ingredients like gingerols, shogaol, and paradols are the valuable ingredients which can prevent various cancers. This review concludes to favor ginger but some ambiguities necessitate further research before claiming its efficacy.
