37239074|t|Whole Blood Spermine/Spermidine Ratio as a New Indicator of Sarcopenia Status in Older Adults.
37239074|a|Early diagnosis and therapeutic intervention improve the quality of life and prognosis of patients with sarcopenia. The natural polyamines spermine and spermidine are involved in many physiological activities. Therefore, we investigated blood polyamine levels as a potential biomarker for sarcopenia. Subjects were Japanese patients >70 years of age who visited outpatient clinics or resided in nursing homes. Sarcopenia was determined based on muscle mass, muscle strength, and physical performance according to the criteria of the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia (2019). The analysis included 182 patients (male: 38%, age: 83 [76-90] years). Spermidine levels were higher (p = 0.002) and the spermine/spermidine ratio was lower (p < 0.001) in the sarcopenia group than in the non-sarcopenia group. Polyamine concentration analysis showed that the odds ratios for age and spermidine changed in parallel with sarcopenia progression, and the odds ratio for the spermine/spermidine ratio changed inversely with the degree of sarcopenia progression. Additionally, when the odds ratio was analyzed with spermine/spermidine instead of polyamine concentrations, only for spermine/spermidine, the odds ratio values varied in parallel with the progression of sarcopenia. Based on the present data, we believe that the blood spermine/spermidine ratio may be a diagnostic indicator of risk for sarcopenia.
