31208471|t|Effect of a multicomponent exercise programme (VIVIFRAIL) on functional capacity in frail community elders with cognitive decline: study protocol for a randomized multicentre control trial.
31208471|a|BACKGROUND: The benefit of physical exercise in ageing and particularly in frailty has been the aim of recent research. Moreover, physical activity in the elderly is associated with a decreased risk of mortality, of common chronic illnesses (i.e. cardiovascular disease or osteoarthritis) and of institutionalization as well as with a delay in functional decline. Additionally, very recent research has shown that, despite its limitations, physical exercise is associated with a reduced risk of dementia, Alzheimer disease or mild cognitive decline. Nevertheless, the effect of physical exercise as a systematic, structured and repetitive type of physical activity, in the reduction of risk of cognitive decline in the elderly, is not very clear. The purpose of this study aims to examine whether an innovative multicomponent exercise programme called VIVIFRAIL has benefits for functional and cognitive status among pre-frail/frail patients with mild cognitive impairment or dementia. METHODS/DESIGN: This study is a multicentre randomized clinical trial to be conducted in the outpatient geriatrics clinics of three tertiary hospitals in Spain. Altogether, 240 patients aged 75 years or older being capable of and willing to provide informed consent, with a Barthel Index >= 60 and mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia, pre-frail or frail and having someone to help to supervise them when conducting the exercises will be randomly assigned to the intervention or control group. Participants randomly assigned to the usual care group will receive normal outpatient care, including physical rehabilitation when needed. The VIVIFRAIL multicomponent exercise intervention programme consists of resistance training, gait re-training and balance training, which appear to be the best strategy for improving gait, balance and strength, as well as reducing the rate of falls in older individuals and consequently maintaining their functional capacity during ageing. The primary endpoint is the change in functional capacity, assessed with the Short Physical Performance Battery (1 point as clinically significant). Secondary endpoints are changes in cognitive and mood status, quality of life (EQ-5D), 6-m gait velocity and changes in gait parameters (i.e. gait velocity and gait variability) while performing a dual-task test (verbal and counting), handgrip, maximal strength and power of the lower limbs as well as Barthel Index of independence (5 points as clinically significant) at baseline and at the 1-month and 3-month follow-up. DISCUSSION: Frailty and cognitive impairment are two very common geriatric syndromes in elderly patients and are frequently related and overlapped. Functional decline and disability are major adverse outcomes of these conditions. Exercise is a potential intervention for both syndromes. If our hypothesis is correct, the relevance of this project is that the results can contribute to understanding that an individualized multicomponent exercise programme (VIVIFRAIL) for frail elderly patients with cognitive impairment is more effective in reducing functional and cognitive impairment than conventional care. Moreover, our study may be able to show that an innovative individualized multicomponent exercise prescription for these high-risk populations is plausible, having at least similar therapeutic effects to other pharmacological and medical prescriptions.
