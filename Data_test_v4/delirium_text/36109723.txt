36109723|t|Post-operative uric acid: a predictor for 30-days mortality of acute type A aortic dissection repair.
36109723|a|BACKGROUND: Hyperuricemia is associated with aortic dissection and cardiovascular diseases. The implication of high serum uric acid (UA) level after acute aortic dissection repair remains unknown. The aim of this study is to explore the role of peri-operative serum UA level in predicting 30-days mortality with acute type A aortic dissection (AAAD) patients, who underwent surgery. METHODS: This study retrospectively enrolled 209 consecutive patients with AAAD, who underwent surgery in Xiangya Hospital from 2017 to 2020. Post-operative laboratory examinations were measured within 24 h after surgery. Univariate analysis and logistic regression analysis were used for predictor finding. RESULTS: 209 consecutive AAAD patients were included, 14.3% (n = 30) were dead within 30 days after surgery. By univariate analysis, we found AAAD repair patients with 30-days mortality had a higher prevalence of cerebral malperfusion, lower pre-operative fibrinogen, longer cardiopulmonary bypass and aortic crossclamp time, and higher post-operative day 1 (POD1) creatinine and urea levels. Both pre-operative (433.80 +- 152.59 vs. 373.46 +- 108.31 mmol/L, p = 0.038) and POD1 (559.78 +- 162.23 vs. 391.29 +- 145.19 mmol/L, p < 0.001) UA level were higher in mortality group than in survival group. In regression model, only cerebral malperfusion (OR, 7.938, 95% CI 1.252-50.323; p = 0.028) and POD1 UA level (OR, 2.562; 95% CI 1.635-4.014; p < 0.001) were independent predictors of 30-days mortality in AAAD repair patients. According to the ROC curve, the POD1 UA level provided positive value for 30-days mortality in AAAD repair patients with 0.799 areas under the curve. The optimum cutoff value selected by ROC curve was 500.15 mmol/L, with a sensitivity of 65% and a specificity of 86%. CONCLUSION: Pre- and post-operative hyperuricemia are potentially associated with worsened outcomes in AAAD surgery patients. The POD1 UA level has a predictive role in 30-days mortality in AAAD repair patients.
