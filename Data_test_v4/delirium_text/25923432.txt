25923432|t|Peptides of presenilin-1 bind the amyloid precursor protein ectodomain and offer a novel and specific therapeutic approach to reduce ss-amyloid in Alzheimer's disease.
25923432|a|beta-Amyloid (Abeta) accumulation in the brain is widely accepted to be critical to the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Current efforts at reducing toxic Abeta40 or 42 have largely focused on modulating gamma-secretase activity to produce shorter, less toxic Abeta, while attempting to spare other secretase functions. In this paper we provide data that offer the potential for a new approach for the treatment of AD. The method is based on our previous findings that the production of Abeta from the interaction between the beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) and Presenilin (PS), as part of the gamma-secretase complex, in cell culture is largely inhibited if the entire water-soluble NH2-terminal domain of PS is first added to the culture. Here we demonstrate that two small, non-overlapping water-soluble peptides from the PS-1 NH2-terminal domain can substantially and specifically inhibit the production of total Abeta as well as Abeta40 and 42 in vitro and in vivo in the brains of APP transgenic mice. These results suggest that the inhibitory activity of the entire amino terminal domain of PS-1 on Abeta production is largely focused in a few smaller sequences within that domain. Using biolayer interferometry and confocal microscopy we provide evidence that peptides effective in reducing Abeta give a strong, specific and biologically relevant binding with the purified ectodomain of APP 695. Finally, we demonstrate that the reduction of Abeta by the peptides does not affect the catalytic activities of beta- or gamma-secretase, or the level of APP. P4 and P8 are the first reported protein site-specific small peptides to reduce Abeta production in model systems of AD. These peptides and their derivatives offer new potential drug candidates for the treatment of AD.
