18644768|a|Cancer continues to be one of the major health and socio-economic problems worldwide, despite considerable efforts to improve its early diagnosis and treatment. The identification of new constituents as biomarkers for early diagnosis of neoplastic cells and the discovery of new type of drugs with their mechanistic actions are crucial to improve cancer therapy. New drugs have entered the market, thanks to industrial and legislative efforts ensuring continuity of pharmaceutical development. New targets have been identified, but cancer therapy and the anti-cancer drug market still partly depend on anti-mitotic agents. The objective of this paper is to show the effects of KAR-2, a potent anti-mitotic compound, and TPPP/p25, a new unstructured protein, on the structural and functional characteristics of the microtubule system. Understanding the actions of these two potential effectors on the microtubule system could be the clue for early diagnosis and improvement of cancer therapy.
