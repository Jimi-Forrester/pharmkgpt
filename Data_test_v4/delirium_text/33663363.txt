33663363|a|Dementia is a chronic neurodegenerative disease, and a maximum number of the cases are directly related to Alzheimer's disease. More than 4 million people are living with Alzheimer's disease-related dementia in India, making it a national crisis. Alzheimer's disease deteriorates cognitive functions with the passage of time and consists of multi-faceted factors, such as the decline of acetylcholine level, amyloid beta-aggregation, tau hyperphosphorylation, oxidative stress, etc. The classical drugs used to date, are focused on only one target and are not serving the cause properly. Hence, the community of scientists is rigorously working on multi-target-directed agents that incorporate two or more active scaffolds in one compound or hybrid of active moieties. This article aims to evaluate novel potential compounds and moieties, such as quinolines, chalcones, coumarins, chromenes, piperazine, carbazoles, cinnamic acids, tacrine hybrids, donepezil hybrids, etc., that have been introduced as multi-target-directed agents in the recent five years.
