1594495|t|What's new in the pathology of neuronal cytoskeleton: the significance of neurofibrillary tangles.
1594495|a|Neurofibrillary tangles are a neuronal change observed in various conditions, linked with dementia when affecting the cerebral cortex as in Alzheimer's disease. They may be found locally close to fibrous or vascular tumors, or affect extensive regions of the neocortex while the cerebellum and the medulla are not affected. Recent immunological and biochemical studies demonstrate that the MT-associated protein tau is the main component of the tangles, in an abnormally phosphorylated state. A consequence of the formation of tangles is a decreased assembly of MT in axons and dendrites, with disturbances of neuroplasmic flow. The relations between tangles and amyloid, as seen in Alzheimer's and Down's diseases are topographical, tangles accumulating in particular in neurites close to the amyloid in the senile plaques (but also at distance in cell bodies and neurites). Genetically and biochemically A4 or beta-amyloid and tau differ. The exact relation between the beta-pleated proteins of tangles and amyloid remain poorly understood.
