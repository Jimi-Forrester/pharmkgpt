36160032|t|Quantitative Expression of SFN, lncRNA CCDC18-AS1, and lncRNA LINC01343 in Human Breast Cancer as the Regulator Biomarkers in a Novel ceRNA Network: Based on Bioinformatics and Experimental Analyses.
36160032|a|Breast cancer (BC) is one of the leading cancers in the world, which has become an increasing serious problem. In this context, reports demonstrate that some long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play significant regulatory roles in breast tumorigenesis and BC progression via various pathways and act as endogenous RNAs. Finding their dysregulation in cancer and evaluating their interaction with other molecules, such as short noncoding RNAs "microRNA (miRNAs)" as well as various genes, are the most important parts in cancer diagnostics. In this study, after performing GSEA and microarray analysis on the GSE71053 dataset, a new ceRNA network of CCDC18-AS1, LINC01343, hsa-miR4462, and SFN in BC was detected by bioinformatics analysis. Therefore, the expression of SFN, CCDC18-AS1, and LINC01343 was quantitatively measured in 24 BC and normal paired tissues using qRT-PCR. CCDC18-AS1, LINC01343, and SFN were expressed higher in BC than in the control (normal paired) tissues based on qRT-PCR data. Furthermore, a significant positive correlation was observed between CCDC18-AS1 and LINC01343 expression in the samples investigated in this study. The investigation of clinicopathological parameters showed that SFN was highly expressed in tumor size of <5 cm and in nonmenopausal ages, while CCDC18-AS1 and LINC01343 indicated a high expression in stages II-III and III of BC, respectively. The overall survival analysis displayed high and low survival in patients with high expression of SFN and CCDC18-AS1, respectively. The ROC curve analysis disclosed that SFN, CCDC18-AS1, and LINC01343 might be suggested as potential biological markers in BC patients. The high expression of CCDC18-AS1, LINC01343, and SFN in BC samples suggests their potential role in BC tumorigenesis and could be considered hallmarks for the diagnosis and prognosis of BC, although this will require further clinical investigations.
