35408581|a|Cisplatin (CP) is a conventional chemotherapeutic agent with serious adverse effects. Its toxicity was linked to the stimulation of oxidative stress and inflammation. As a result, this study explored the protective effect of baicalein and alpha-tocopherol in nephrotoxicity induced by cisplatin. Until receiving an intraperitoneal injection of CP (3 mg/kg BW), rats were given baicalein orally 100 mg/kg for seven days or/and a single intraperitoneal injection of alpha-tocopherol 250 mg/kg. Renal function was tested to explore whether baicalein and alpha-tocopherol have any beneficial effects; blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum creatinine, malondialdehyde (MDA) content, antioxidant activity biomarkers and histopathology of renal tissue, oxidative stress biomarkers, inflammatory response markers, and histopathological features of kidney architecture were measured. Cisplatin treatment resulted in extreme renal failure, as measured by high serum creatinine and BUN levels and severe renal changes. Cisplatin therapy resulted in increased lipid peroxidation and decreased glutathione and superoxide dismutase levels, reflecting oxidative stress. Upon treatment with alpha-tocopherol, baicalein, and combined therapy, there was augmentation in the antioxidant status as well as a reduction in IL-6, NF-kappaB, TNF, TLR2, and TLR4 and a significant increase in Keap-1 and NRF-2. The combined treatment was the most effective and the nearest to the normal status. These findings suggest that baicalein and alpha-tocopherol may be useful in preventing cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity.
