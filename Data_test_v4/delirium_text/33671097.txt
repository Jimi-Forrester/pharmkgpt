33671097|a|Recent evidence suggests that amyloid and tau protein are of vital importance in post-ischemic death of CA1 pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus. In this review, we summarize protein alterations associated with Alzheimer's disease and their gene expression (amyloid protein precursor and tau protein) after cerebral ischemia, as well as their roles in post-ischemic hippocampus neurodegeneration. In recent years, multiple studies aimed to elucidate the post-ischemic processes in the development of hippocampus neurodegeneration. Their findings have revealed the dysregulation of genes for amyloid protein precursor, beta-secretase, presenilin 1 and 2, tau protein, autophagy, mitophagy, and apoptosis identical in nature to Alzheimer's disease. Herein, we present the latest data showing that amyloid and tau protein associated with Alzheimer's disease and their genes play a key role in post-ischemic neurodegeneration of the hippocampus with subsequent development of dementia. Therefore, understanding the underlying process for the development of post-ischemic CA1 area neurodegeneration in the hippocampus in conjunction with Alzheimer's disease-related proteins and genes will provide the most important therapeutic development goals to date.
