33126586|t|Transcriptomic Analysis of Human Astrocytes In Vitro Reveals Hypoxia-Induced Mitochondrial Dysfunction, Modulation of Metabolism, and Dysregulation of the Immune Response.
33126586|a|Hypoxia is a feature of neurodegenerative diseases, and can both directly and indirectly impact on neuronal function through modulation of glial function. Astrocytes play a key role in regulating homeostasis within the central nervous system, and mediate hypoxia-induced changes in response to reduced oxygen availability. The current study performed a detailed characterization of hypoxia-induced changes in the transcriptomic profile of astrocytes in vitro. Human astrocytes were cultured under normoxic (5% CO2, 95% air) or hypoxic conditions (1% O2, 5% CO2, 94% N2) for 24 h, and the gene expression profile assessed by microarray analysis. In response to hypoxia 4904 genes were significantly differentially expressed (1306 upregulated and 3598 downregulated, FC >= 2 and p <= 0.05). Analysis of the significant differentially expressed transcripts identified an increase in immune response pathways, and dysregulation of signalling pathways, including HIF-1 (p = 0.002), and metabolism, including glycolysis (p = 0.006). To assess whether the hypoxia-induced metabolic gene changes observed affected metabolism at a functional level, both the glycolytic and mitochondrial flux were measured using an XF bioanalyser. In support of the transcriptomic data, under physiological conditions hypoxia significantly reduced mitochondrial respiratory flux (p = 0.0001) but increased basal glycolytic flux (p = 0.0313). However, when metabolically stressed, hypoxia reduced mitochondrial spare respiratory capacity (p = 0.0485) and both glycolytic capacity (p = 0.0001) and glycolytic reserve (p < 0.0001). In summary, the current findings detail hypoxia-induced changes in the astrocyte transcriptome in vitro, identifying potential targets for modifying the astrocyte response to reduced oxygen availability in pathological conditions associated with ischaemia/hypoxia, including manipulation of mitochondrial function, metabolism, and the immune response.
