14671810|t|[Pharmacotherapy of elderly patients from the clinical viewpoint].
14671810|a|Due to increasing incidence of chronic diseases with advancing age, drugs are predominantly prescribed to elderly patients. But there is a lack of data, representing this age group. As the aging organism shows various physiologic changes that may influence pharmacokinetic parameters, an individualized risk-benefit-analysis is warranted. Moreover, functional limitations may bare additional risks of pharmacotherapy promoting adverse drug reactions. Frequent adverse drug reactions in the elderly are falls, delirium and anticholinergic symptoms. An assessment of potential hazards of pharmacotherapy is therefore essential. It should include physiologic parameters, in particular renal function, possible functional limitations and parameters of compliance. Furthermore a prudent clinical monitoring of drug therapy can limit adverse drug reactions and polypharmacotherapy due to a prescribing cascade.
