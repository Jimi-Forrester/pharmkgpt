32072125|t|Standardized Opioid Prescription Protocol Reduces Opioid Consumption After Total Joint Arthroplasty.
32072125|a|Previous studies demonstrate routine overprescription of pain medications after total joint arthroplasty (TJA). A standardized reduced opioid prescription protocol for TJA was initiated at our institution, which we hypothesized would lead to a reduction in opioid consumption compared with patients who had surgery before initiation of the new protocol. METHODS: We evaluated 97 consecutive opioid-naive patients undergoing primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and total hip arthroplasty (THA) using a standardized opioid prescription protocol (standardized group). A control subject group consisted of 99 patients undergoing TKA and THA just before the adaptation of the standardized prescribing protocol (historic group). Postoperatively, patients brought their remaining pain medication to their 1-month follow-up visit. The number of pills consumed was counted and converted into oral morphine equivalents (OME). Current pain level and the need for pain medication refill was assessed. RESULTS: Among TKA patients, mean opioid consumption in the standardized group (48.5 pills; 432 OME) was markedly less than the historic group (76.2 pills; 903 OME) (both P < 0.01). Refills were required in 50% of the standardized group and 29% of the historic group (P = 0.038). Average pain scores for the standardized and historic groups were 2.3 and 3.2, respectively (P = 0.057). Among THA patients, mean opioid consumption in the standardized group (19.1 pills; 200 OME) was markedly less than the historic group (41.3 pills; 504 OME) (both P < 0.01). Refills were required in 16% of the standardized group and 8% of the historic group (P = 0.263). Average pain scores for the standardized and historic groups were 1.7 and 1.8, respectively (P = 0.608). DISCUSSION: Initiation of a standardized opioid prescribing protocol after TJA for opioid-naive patients led to a reduction in opioid consumption, but resulted in an increased need for refills.
