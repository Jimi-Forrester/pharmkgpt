37179670|a|Objective: Environmental influence and dietary variations are well-known risk factors for various diseases including neurodegenerative disorders. Preliminary evidence suggests that diet in early-life and living environment might influence the incidence of Parkinson's disease (PD) in later phase of life. There have been limited epidemiologic studies on this aspect especially in India. In this hospital-based case-control study, we intended to identify dietary and environmental risk factors of PD. Methods: Patients with PD (n = 105), Alzheimer's disease (AD) (n = 53) and healthy individuals (n = 81) were recruited. Dietary intake and environmental exposures were assessed using a validated Food-Frequency and Environmental Hazard Questionnaire. Their demographic details and living environment were also recorded using the same questionnaire. Results: Pre-morbid consumption of carbohydrate and fat was significantly higher whereas dietary fiber and fruit content was significantly lesser in PD as compared to AD and healthy age-matched controls. Meat and milk intake was the highest among all the food groups in PD patients. Rural living and their habitation near water bodies were significantly more frequent in PD patients. Conclusion: We found that past intake of carbohydrate, fat, milk, and meat are associated with increased risk of PD. On the other hand, rural living and habitat near water bodies might be associated with incidence and severity of PD. Hence, preventive strategies related to dietary and environmental modulators in PD might be clinically useful in the future.
