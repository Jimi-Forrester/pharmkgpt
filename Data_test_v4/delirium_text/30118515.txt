30118515|t|Comprehensive analysis of differentially expressed microRNAs and mRNAs in dorsal root ganglia from streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats.
30118515|a|Diabetic peripheral neuropathy is a common complication associated with diabetes mellitus with a pathogenesis that is incompletely understood. By regulating RNA silencing and post-transcriptional gene expression, microRNAs participate in various biological processes and human diseases. However, the relationship between microRNAs and the progress of diabetic peripheral neuropathy still lacks a thorough exploration. Here we used microarray microRNA and mRNA expression profiling to analyze the microRNAs and mRNAs which are aberrantly expressed in dorsal root ganglia from streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. We found that 37 microRNAs and 1357 mRNAs were differentially expressed in comparison to non-diabetic samples. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that 399 gene ontology terms and 29 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways were significantly enriched in diabetic rats. Additionally, a microRNA-gene network evaluation identified rno-miR-330-5p, rno-miR-17-1-3p and rno-miR-346 as important players for network regulation. Finally, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis was used to confirm the microarray results. In conclusion, this study provides a systematic perspective of microRNA and mRNA expression in dorsal root ganglia from diabetic rats, and suggests that dysregulated microRNAs and mRNAs may be important promotors of peripheral neuropathy. Our results may be the underlying framework of future studies regarding the effect of the aberrantly expressed genes on the pathophysiology of diabetic peripheral neuropathy.
