27082952|a|The complex etiopathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has limited progression in the identification of effective therapeutic agents. Amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin-1 (PS1) are always overexpressed in AD, and are considered to be the initiators of the formation of beta-amyloid plaques and the symptoms of AD. In the present study, a transgenic AD model, constructed via the overexpression of APP and PS1, was used to verify the protective effects of ginsenoside Rg1 on memory performance and synaptic plasticity. AD mice (6-month-old) were treated via intraperitoneal injection of 0.1-10 mg/kg ginsenoside Rg1. Long-term memory, synaptic plasticity, and the levels of AD-associated and synaptic plasticity-associated proteins were measured following treatment. Memory was measured using a fear conditioning task and protein expression levels were investigated using western blotting. All the data was analyzed by one-way analysis of variance or t-test. Following 30 days of consecutive treatment, memory in the AD mouse model was ameliorated in the 10 mg/kg ginsenoside Rg1 treatment group. As demonstrated by biochemical experiments, ginsenoside Rg1 treatment reduced the accumulations of beta-amyloid 1-42 and phosphorylated (p)-Tau in the AD model. Additionally, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and p-TrkB synaptic plasticity-associated proteins were upregulated following ginsenoside Rg1 application. Correspondingly, long-term potentiation (LTP) was restored following ginsenoside Rg1 application in the AD mice model. Taken together, ginsenoside Rg1 repaired hippocampal LTP and memory, likely through facilitating the clearance of AD-associated proteins and through activation of the BDNF-TrkB pathway. Therefore, ginsenoside Rg1 may be a candidate drug for the treatment of AD.
