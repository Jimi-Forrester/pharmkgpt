3512080|a|In a double-blind, crossover study, mazindol (1 mg) at breakfast, lunch, and 4:00 PM was compared with a placebo to determine its efficacy for symptom control in 30 terminal cancer patients. In 26 evaluable patients, intensity of pain and analgesic consumption were significantly improved after mazindol, while anxiety, appetite, and food consumption were significantly worse. Activity and depression were not modified by mazindol. After the completion of the trial, mazindol was chosen as a more effective drug by the patients in ten cases (38%) and by the investigators in nine (35%); placebo was chosen by the patients in seven cases (27%) and by the investigators in 11 (42%). Two patients (7%) developed delirium that required discontinuation of treatment. At the present time, there are no clearcut indications for mazindol in terminal cancer patients.
