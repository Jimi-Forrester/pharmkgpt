33521997|a|BACKGROUND: Oral health problems increase with age, and are common in nursing home residents, especially in those with dementia. These problems can lead to tooth loss, diminished oral function and malnutrition. OBJECTIVES: To compare oral function, nutritional status and quality of life (QoL) between residents with and without dementia, and to examine associations between these variables. METHODS: Cross-sectional study conducted in four UK nursing homes. Residents aged 65 + with and without dementia were included. Information was collected on demographics, dental status, quality of swallowing and chewing, xerostomia and orofacial pain. During oral examination, information was collected on number of teeth and occlusal units (OU), and functional categories (eg, OU combined with dentures). Multiple linear regression was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Of 84 residents with and 27 without dementia participated. Residents with dementia had significantly fewer teeth (Dementia median (IQR) = 14 (6-21), vs No dementia 22 (12.75-24.25); P = .021), fewer OU (Dementia median (IQR) = 0 (0-3), vs No dementia 4 (0-7); P = .001) and poorer functional categories (Z = -3.283; P = .001), and nutritional status was significantly poorer than those without (Dementia Mean (SD) = 8.3 (2.7), vs No dementia 10.4 (2.0); P = .002). In the regression model, quality of chewing (Coef (95% CI) = -1.27 (-2.22, -0.31); P = .010) was significantly correlated with nutritional status. CONCLUSION: Oral function and nutritional status of residents with dementia was poorer than those without. Almost half of all residents had insufficient oral function, which was negatively associated with QoL and nutritional status.
