22307963|t|A two-step strategy for structure-activity relationship studies of N-methylated abeta42 C-terminal fragments as abeta42 toxicity inhibitors.
22307963|a|Neurotoxic Abeta42 oligomers are believed to be the main cause of Alzheimer's disease. Previously, we found that the C-terminal fragments (CTFs), Abeta(30-42) and Abeta(31-42) were the most potent inhibitors of Abeta42 oligomerization and toxicity in a series of Abeta(x-42) peptides (x=28-39). Therefore, we chose these peptides as leads for further development. These CTFs are short (12-13 amino acids) hydrophobic peptides with limited aqueous solubility. Our first attempt to attach hydrophilic groups to the N terminus resulted in toxic peptides. Therefore, we next incorporated N-methyl amino acids, which are known to increase the solubility of such peptides by disrupting the beta-sheet formation. Focusing on Abeta(31-42), we used a two-step N-methyl amino acid substitution strategy to study the structural factors controlling inhibition of Abeta42-induced toxicity. First, each residue was substituted by N-Me-alanine (N-Me-A). In the next step, in positions where substitution produced a significant effect, we restored the original side chain. This strategy allowed exploring the role of both side chain structure and N-Me substitution in inhibitory activity. We found that the introduction of an N-Me amino acid was an effective way to increase both the aqueous solubility and the inhibitory activity of Abeta(31-42). In particular, N-Me amino acid substitution at position 9 or 11 increased the inhibitory activity relative to the parent peptide. The data suggest that inhibition of Abeta42 toxicity by short peptides is highly structure-specific, providing a basis for the design of new peptidomimetic inhibitors with improved activity, physicochemical properties, and metabolic stability.
