38912489|t|In silico analysis of the use of solanine derivatives as a treatment for Alzheimer's disease.
38912489|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a brain illness that causes cognitive impairment in the elderly, especially females, as a result of genetics, hormones, and life experiences. It becomes more severe with age and is associated with cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and diabetes. Beta-amyloid plaques and hyper phosphorylated Tau protein buildup are common clinical findings. Misfiling of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and Amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) proteins contributes to Alzheimer's disease. Enzyme Acetylcholinesterase enzyme interacts with amyloid-beta, enhancing its accumulation in insoluble plaques, leading to successful treatment for Alzheimer's disease primarily based on lowering this enzyme. Treatments include using the Rivastigmine for mild, moderate, or severe Alzheimer's disease, which inhibits acetylcholinesterase, but may cause side effects; Solanine derivatives, nightshade toxin, it is cholinesterase inhibitory, may mitigate Alzheimer's illness is progressing. In this research utilized a molecular docking program, which is a computer's computational ability to determine the optimal position for a specific compound to bind to a protein or target, forming a target-ligand complex and displaying biological activity and aiding in the development of effective anti-AD treatments and understanding AD pathological mechanisms. The study examined complexes of 3LII (Acetylcholinesterase receptor) in the A and B chain with Solanine and Rivastigmine derivatives, using an in-silico approach. PyRx default sorter was used to improve docking accuracy. Four compounds were selected based on their higher binding affinities in chain A and B. The results showed that Solanine derivatives (alpha-Solanine, Beta1-Solanine and Beta2-Solanine) have higher binding strength (-9.0,-9.3 and -8.6) than Rivastigmine (-7.2) in chain A, and also the binding strength was high for the Solanine derivatives (alpha-Solanine, Beta1-Solanine, and Beta2-Solanine) (-9.0,-8.8 and -8.9) is higher than Rivastigmine (-6.0) in the chain B. Solanine derivatives showed higher binding strength with acetylcholinesterase, potentially for to reduce the progression of the disease.
