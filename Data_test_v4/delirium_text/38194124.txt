38194124|t|The effect of a post-anaesthesia high-care unit (PAHCU) admission on mobilization, length of stay and in-hospital mortality post-surgery in low energy neck of femur fracture patients.
38194124|a|PURPOSE/AIM: With an ageing population and an increase in fragility fractures of the hip (FFH), the role of an anaesthetist is evolving to include more peri-operative care. A post-anaesthesia high-care unit (PAHCU) should enhance care in post-operative patients. To our knowledge, there are no studies that have investigated the effect of a PAHCU admission on post-operative outcomes after FFH. This study aimed to compare post-operative outcomes of FFH patients admitted to PAHCU versus a standard post-operative orthopaedic ward (POOW). METHODOLOGY: A retrospective cohort study was conducted on adult patients with FFH who underwent surgery between January 2019 and December 2020 at our institution. Data were sourced from electronic medical records. SPSS version 28 was used to analyse data. RESULTS: A total of 231 patients were included. The PAHCU group (n = 35) displayed a higher burden of chronic illness and higher peri-operative risk scores as compared to the POOW group (n = 196). Median time to mobilize (TTM) in PAHCU was 84 h vs. 45 h in POOW group (p = 0.013). Median length of stay (LOS) in PAHCU was 133 h vs. 94 h in POOW (p = 0.001). The in-hospital mortality was 2.9% (n = 1) for PAHCU and 3.6% (n = 7) for POOW (p = 1). The 30-day mortality was 11.8% (n = 4) for PAHCU and 10.1% (n = 19) in POOW. CONCLUSION: PAHCU admission resulted in delayed time to surgery and TTM, together with prolonged LOS, compared to those managed in POOW. However, these mortality rates remained comparable in both groups. This study contributes valuable insights into post-operative care of FFH patients in a resource-poor setting.
