33158825|t|Pharmaceutical management of elderly high-risk patients in perioperative settings (PHAROS): protocol of a pilot sequential intervention study.
33158825|a|INTRODUCTION: With increasing age, the risk of complications after surgery rises in elderly patients. Furthermore, the prevalence of multimorbidity and polypharmacy rises with age, making this elderly population especially vulnerable for drug-related problems and posing an additional risk for postoperative complications. Still, only few studies have concentrated on investigating how medication safety can be improved in these patients. The aim of this pilot study is to examine the impact of a comprehensive intervention (interprofessional systematic medication therapy management) on medication appropriateness in elderly polymedicated, multimorbid patients during hospital stay for elective surgery. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This pilot study will include a total number of 140 patients. Surgical high-risk patients >=65 years taking more than five chronic systemic drugs will be recruited consecutively for 9 months in the control group capturing usual care regarding medication history and in-hospital medication therapy management without any study intervention. Recruitment of the intervention group will be conducted for another 9 months. The intervention consists of the following components: an additional medication history by a hospital pharmacist before admission, a subsequent medication review, optimisation of the long-term medication and recommendations to the patient's general practitioner. A follow-up will be performed 3 months after surgery. As the primary study outcome, medication appropriateness will be measured using the Medication Appropriateness Index.Secondary outcomes are postoperative complications, incidence and frequency of adverse drug reactions and potentially inappropriate medication in the elderly, satisfaction with inpatient and outpatient care, medication reconciliation and health-related quality of life. Multivariable analyses will be used to analyse all quantitative research questions. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval was obtained by the medical ethics committee of the Medical Chamber of Hamburg (study ID: PV5754). Data will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at conferences. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: The study is registered at www.drks.de: DRKS00014621.
