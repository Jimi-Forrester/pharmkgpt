10356423|a|The identification of COX-2 less than a decade ago has been followed by an unprecedented period of discovery and drug development. An awareness of the existence of two COX isoforms has led to potential novel insights into disease pathogenesis (arthritis, Alzheimer's disease, cancer) and the regulation of normal physiology (brain, kidney). The preliminary in vivo experience with COX-2-selective inhibitors has provided evidence for proof of concept for the COX-1 and COX-2 hypothesis, namely that the selective inhibition of COX-2-derived prostaglandins is sufficient to inhibit inflammation and is nonulcerogenic. It may be that we have moved closer to the "better aspirin" envisioned by Sir John Vane for the treatment of degenerative and inflammatory arthritides; however, caution is still warranted. Some toxicities of current NSAIDs may result from COX-2 inhibition, as in the kidney and brain; such side effects may be shared by the selective compounds. In addition, unexpected toxicities may arise simply because new chemical compounds will be widely prescribed. Finally, since the efficacy of traditional NSAIDs derives largely from their capacity to inhibit COX-2, it may be that the COX-2 selective drugs will not prove to be therapeutically superior to available agents. Given the well-recognized toxicity of NSAIDs, however, the availability of COX-2-selective agents promises to provide significant advantage to patients with chronic diseases, such as RA and OA.
