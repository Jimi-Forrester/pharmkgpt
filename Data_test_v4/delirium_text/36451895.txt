36451895|t|Antihyperglycemic Drug Use in Long-Stay Nursing Home Residents with Diabetes Mellitus.
36451895|a|Background: About 29.2% of American adults >= 65 years of age have diabetes mellitus, but details regarding diabetes management especially among nursing home residents are dated. Objectives: Evaluate the prevalence of antihyperglycemic agents in residents with diabetes mellitus and describe resident characteristics using major drug classes. Design: cross-sectional study. Setting: virtually all United States nursing homes. Participants: 141,636 residents with diabetes mellitus. Measurements: Minimum Data Set (2016) and Medicare Part D claims determined use of metformin, sulfonylureas, meglitinide analogs, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, TZDs, DPP4 inhibitors, SGLT2 inhibitors, GLP1 agonists, as monotherapy and with basal insulin. Results: Seventy-two percent received antihyperglycemic drugs [most common: basal insulins (53.9% total; 46.9% with other non-insulin agents), metformin (35.5% total; 14.2% monotherapy), sulfonylureas (19.6% total; 6.3% monotherapy), and DPP4 inhibitors (12.2% total; 2.2% monotherapy)]. Sixty-three percent of meglitinide monotherapy versus 34.1% of metformin monotherapy users; and 38.3% meglitinide-basal insulin versus 22.2% metformin-basal insulin users were >=85 years. Obesity was greater among users of GLP1 agonists compared to those receiving other agents (monotherapy: 60.5% versus 33-42%; with basal insulin: 76.2% versus 50-58%). End-stage renal disease was least prevalent among metformin users (monotherapy: 6.6%; with basal insulin: 8.8%) and most common among meglitinide monotherapy (19.6%) and GLP1 agonists with basal insulin (22%) users. Conclusions: There is heterogeneity of diabetes treatment in nursing homes. Use of antihyperglycemic drugs with a higher risk of hypoglycemia, such as insulin with sulfonylureas or meglitinides, continue in nursing home residents.
