22575537|a|Aluminium (Al) is a potent neurotoxin and has together with other metals been suggested to be associated with Alzheimer's disease causality. The current study was carried out to investigate the potential role of N(2-hydroxyethyl) ethylenediamine triacetic acid (HEDTA) and Se in combination against Al induced toxicity. Animals were exposed to Al at a dose of 27 mg/kg/d i.p. for 60 days. HEDTA and Se were administered at a dose of 20mg/kg/d i.p. and 0.5mg/kg/d orally, respectively for 7 consecutive days. Induction of oxidative stress was recorded in the brain after Al exposure. Significant decrease was found in the levels of reduced glutathione activities of the enzymes glutathione reductase, glutathione peroxidase, catalase, superoxide dismutase, acetyl cholinesterase, and increased levels were observed in LPO and glutathione-S-transferase activity in brain and serum. These parameters responded positively to therapy with HEDTA, but more pronounced beneficial effects were observed when HEDTA was administered in combination with Se. The combination was effective in reducing the concentration of Al and level of DNA damage.
