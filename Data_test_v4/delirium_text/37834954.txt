37834954|t|Observations on the Clinical Features of the Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome.
37834954|a|This paper begins with a short case report of florid, spontaneous confabulation in a 61-year-old man with an alcohol-induced Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome. His confabulation extended across episodic and personal semantic memory, as well as orientation in time and place, as measured on Dalla Barba's Confabulation Battery. Five other brief case summaries will then be presented, followed by a summary of the clinical, neurological, and background neuropsychological findings in three earlier series of Korsakoff patients. These observations will be considered in light of Wijnia's recent and my own, earlier reviews of the Korsakoff syndrome. Taken together, they indicate the need for a multi-faceted approach (clinical, neurological, neuropsychological, and neuroimaging) to the assessment and diagnosis of the disorder.
