24582850|t|Ameliorating effect of spinosin, a C-glycoside flavonoid, on scopolamine-induced memory impairment in mice.
24582850|a|Spinosin is a C-glycoside flavonoid isolated from the seeds of Zizyphus jujuba var. spinosa. This study investigated the effect of spinosin on cholinergic blockade-induced memory impairment in mice. Behavioral tests were conducted using the passive avoidance, Y-maze, and Morris water maze tasks to evaluate the memory-ameliorating effect of spinosin. Spinosin (10 or 20mg/kg, p.o.) significantly ameliorated scopolamine-induced cognitive impairment in these behavioral tasks with a prolonged latency time in the passive avoidance task, an increased percentage of spontaneous alternation in the Y-maze task and a lengthened swimming time in target quadrant in the Morris water maze task. In addition, a single administration of spinosin in normal naive mice also enhanced the latency time in the passive avoidance task. To identify the mechanism of the memory-ameliorating effect of spinosin, receptor antagonism analysis and Western blotting were performed. The ameliorating effect of spinosin on scopolamine-induced memory impairment was significantly antagonized by a sub-effective dose (0.5mg/kg, i.p.) of 8-hydroxy-2-(di-N-propylamino)tetralin, a 5-HT1A receptor agonist. In addition, spinosin significantly increased the expression levels of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinases and cAMP response element-binding proteins in the hippocampus. Taken together, these results indicate that the memory-ameliorating effect of spinosin may be, in part, due to the serotonergic neurotransmitter system, and that spinosin may be useful for the treatment of cognitive dysfunction in diseases such as Alzheimer's disease.
