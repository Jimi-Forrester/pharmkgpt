38018298|t|Screening of the Active Substances for the Assessment of Walnut Kernel in the Treatment of Scopolamine-Induced AD Animals.
38018298|a|SCOPE: Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been a challenge and hotspot in the field of neuroscience research due to the high morbidity. As we all know, walnut kernel (WK) ingestion has been linked to benefits to brain health and has the function of improving memory. This study follows the AD model induced by scopolamine to reveal the active fractions and substances of walnut in the treatment of AD. METHODS AND RESULTS: The histopathological analysis and brain tissue biochemistry assay are revealed the active fractions of WK, and this result determines that walnut kernel organic acids have significant therapeutic effect on AD. The strategy of studying ingredients pointed at lesions is integrated to ascertain the selected brain-targeted effective substances of WK for blood-brain barrier by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole/electrostatic field orbitrap mass spectrometry, and a total of eight organic acids are figured out definite absorptivity in rat brains. Finally, the binding interaction between the effective substances and target proteins is analyzed by molecular docking, and the main function related active markers are ascertained as glansreginin A, glansreginic acid, ellagic acid, and ellagic acid 4-O-xyloside. CONCLUSIONS: The comprehensive process is helpful to the clinical application of WK as a promising cholinesterase inhibitors for nutritional intervention.
