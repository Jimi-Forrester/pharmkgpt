38240992|t|The Role of Glia Telomere Dysfunction in the Pathogenesis of Central Nervous System Diseases.
38240992|a|Maintaining the telomere length is decisive for the viability and homeostasis process of all the cells of an organism, including human glial cells. Telomere shortening of microglial cells has been widely associated with the onset and progression of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. Additionally, traumatic brain injury appears to have a positive correlation with the telomere-shortening process of microglia, and telomere length can be used as a non-invasive biomarker for the clinical management of these patients. Moreover, telomere involvement through telomerase reactivation and homologous recombination also known as the alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) has been described in gliomagenesis pathways, and particular focus has been given in the translational significance of these mechanisms in gliomas diagnosis and prognostic classification. Finally, glia telomere shortening is implicated in some psychiatric diseases. Given that telomere dysfunction of glial cells is involved in the central nervous system (CNS) disease pathogenesis, it represents a promising drug target that could lead to the incorporation of new tools in the medicinal arsenal for the management of so far incurable conditions.
