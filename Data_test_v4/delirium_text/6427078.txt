6427078|t|Antiepileptic drugs and psychiatric disorders: mechanism involved in manifestation of psychic symptoms of high blood level of antiepileptics.
6427078|a|The adverse psychic effects of antiepileptics embrace all categories of psychiatric symptomatology, including disturbances of consciousness (delirium, confusion), psychotic state (schizophrenia-like psychosis, affective disorder), neurotic state, behavior and character disorder. Antiepileptic intoxication can take the form of a psychotic episode. The lowered level of consciousness due to a high blood level of antiepileptics is expressed as inhibitory symptoms such as a lack of initiative, psychomotor slowing, lowering mood, stuporous state and the like. Another group of manifestation of a high blood level of antiepileptics, by contrast, consists of salient positive symptoms such as irritability, hyperkinetic syndrome, hysterical symptoms, aggravation of character change, delirium and confusion. An elevated blood level of antiepileptics by itself is not sufficient to give rise to a psychiatric symptom, which is rather prone to occur in the presence of some trouble or problems (defect in intelligence or personality, fragility of brain function, organic brain damage, psychogenic factors) in the patient.
