Methods: Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were characterized and functional enrichment analysis was performed in DN patients. Meanwhile, a weighted gene co-expression network (WGCNA) was also constructed. For further, algorithms Lasso and SVM-RFE were applied to screening the DN core secreted genes. Lastly, WB, IHC, IF, and Elias experiments were applied to demonstrate the hub gene expression in DN, and the research results were confirmed in mouse models and clinical specimens. Results: 17 hub secretion genes were identified in this research by analyzing the DEGs, the important module genes in WGCNA, and the secretion genes. 6 hub secretory genes (APOC1, CCL21, INHBA, RNASE6, TGFBI, VEGFC) were obtained by Lasso and SVM-RFE algorithms. APOC1 was discovered to exhibit elevated expression in renal tissue of a DN mouse model, and APOC1 is probably a core secretory gene in DN. Clinical data demonstrate that APOC1 expression is associated significantly with proteinuria and GFR in DN patients. APOC1 expression in the serum of DN patients was 1.358+-0.1292mug/ml, compared to 0.3683+-0.08119mug/ml in the healthy population. APOC1 was significantly elevated in the sera of DN patients and the difference was statistical significant (P > 0.001). The ROC curve of APOC1 in DN gave an AUC = 92.5%, sensitivity = 95%, and specificity = 97% (P < 0.001). Conclusions: Our research indicates that APOC1 might be a novel diagnostic biomarker for diabetic nephropathy for the first time and suggest that APOC1 may be available as a candidate intervention target for DN.
