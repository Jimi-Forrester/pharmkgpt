38413428|a|Proximal femoral fractures occur at an annual incidence of approximately 200/100,000 inhabitants and mortality rates range up to 30% especially in geriatric patients where complications are not necessarily associated to surgery. In nearly all cases surgical treatment is required. Procedures to preserve the femoral head have to be performed as early as possible (as specified by the Federal Joint Committee, GBA, within 24 h). For joint-preserving approaches in medial femoral neck fractures a time to surgery within 6 h is considered to be advantageous. Perioperative patient care is of high importance regarding the prevention of pneumonia, renal failure, delirium and further complications. Postoperatively full weight bearing enables for early mobilization and prevention of surgery-related complications. Nonunions, avascular necrosis of the femoral head, cut-out and prosthetic dislocation must be avoided by the selection of the appropriate procedure. Minimally displaced femoral neck fractures are primarily treated by osteosynthesis and conservative management is only considered in isolated cases. For displaced femoral neck fractures, factors such as a young biological age with high activity levels, the absence of arthritis and good bone quality with a successful reduction favor for a femoral head-preserving osteosynthesis. Otherwise, (hybrid) total hip replacement (THR) is the preferred method for unstable and displaced fractures, whereby hemiarthroplasty should only be considered for very old and patients with pre-existing diseases. Fractures in the trochanteric region are treated with a proximal femoral nail and subtrochanteric fractures are managed using a long proximal femoral nail. To avoid secondary complications, the choice of optimal treatment should be based on a good understanding of the injury pattern, biomechanical and technical aspects of each procedure.
