37418213|a|With the growth of the aging population, more age-related diseases endanger the health of the elderly, and therefore more research attention has been put on Alzheimer's disease and dementia. Dementia does not only posing a serious threat to basic daily living in old age but also impose a greater burden on social and medical care as well as the economy. It is urgent to explore the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease and develop effective medicine to prevent or mitigate its onset. Currently, many related mechanisms of the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease have been proposed, such as beta-amyloid (A) theory, Tau protein theory, and nerve and blood vessel theory. In addition, from the perspective of improving cognitive function and controlling mental state, dementia-related therapeutic drugs were developed, such as anti-amyloid agents, amyloid vaccine, tau vaccine, and tau-aggregation inhibitor. These theories of pathogenesis and the development of drugs provide valuable experience to lift the veil of cognitive disorders in the future.
