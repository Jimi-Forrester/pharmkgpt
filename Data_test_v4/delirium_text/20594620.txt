20594620|a|Accumulating evidence indicates that white matter degeneration contributes to the neural disconnections that underlie Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology. Although this white matter degeneration is partly attributable to axonopathy associated with neuronal degeneration, amyloid beta (Abeta) protein-mediated damage to oligodendrocytes could be another mechanism. To test this hypothesis, we studied effects of soluble Abeta in oligomeric form on survival and differentiation of cells of the oligodendroglial lineage using highly purified oligodendroglial cultures from rats at different developmental stages. Abeta oligomer at 10 muM or higher reduced survival of mature oligodendrocytes, whereas oligodendroglial progenitor cells (OPCs) were relatively resistant to the Abeta oligomer-mediated cytotoxicity. Further study revealed that Abeta oligomer even at 1 muM accelerated 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) formazan exocytosis in mature oligodendrocytes, and, more significantly, inhibited myelin sheet formation after induction of in vitro differentiation of OPCs. These results imply a novel pathogenetic mechanism underlying Abeta oligomer-mediated white matter degeneration, which could impair myelin maintenance and remyelination by adult OPCs, resulting in accumulating damage to myelinating axons thereby contributing to neural disconnections.
