33498262|t|The Role of Natural Antioxidants in the Prevention of Dementia-Where Do We Stand and Future Perspectives.
33498262|a|Dementia, and especially Alzheimer's disease (AD), puts significant burden on global healthcare expenditure through its increasing prevalence. Research has convincingly demonstrated the implication of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of dementia as well as of the conditions which increase the risk of developing dementia. However, drugs which target single pathways have so far failed in providing significant neuroprotection. Natural antioxidants, due to their effects in multiple pathways through which oxidative stress leads to neurodegeneration and triggers neuroinflammation, could prove valuable weapons in our fight against dementia. Although efficient in vitro and in animal models of AD, natural antioxidants in human trials have many drawbacks related to the limited bioavailability, unknown optimal dose, or proper timing of the treatment. Nonetheless, trials evaluating several of these natural compounds are ongoing, as are attempts to modify these compounds to achieve improved bioavailability.
