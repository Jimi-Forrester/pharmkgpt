36206298|t|A preliminary, prospective study of peripheral neuropathy and cognitive function in patients with breast cancer during taxane therapy.
36206298|a|Dramatic improvements in cancer survival have occurred in the last decade, but the quality of life for many survivors is compromised due to severe, long-lasting, and often irreversible side effects of chemotherapy. The neurological side effects, chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) and cancer related/induced cognitive impairment (CRCI/CICI), are under-recognized and can occur after chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or radiation. The cellular mechanisms underlying these neurological side effects are poorly understood and there are no effective treatments or preventions, other than reduction or termination of cancer therapy. In our preliminary prospective, non-interventional study to examine the side effects of chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer (NCT03872141), patients with breast cancer who received standard of care single agent weekly taxane-based chemotherapy were assessed at baseline, midpoint, and end of treatment for neurological and cognitive changes and for blood levels of potential protein biomarkers (n = 13). CIPN and CRCI both showed an increase in severity with accumulating taxane and these changes were compared to protein alternations over the course of treatment. Using peripheral blood collected from patients (n = 10) during chemotherapy and tested with an antibody array curated by the MD Anderson RPPA Core), we found that 19 proteins were increased, and 12 proteins decreased over 12 weeks of treatment. Among those downregulate were proteins known to be critical for neuronal viability and function including GRB2 (growth factor receptor-bound protein 2) and NCS1 (neuronal calcium sensor 1). Concurrently, proteins associated with apoptosis, including BAK1 (Bcl-1 homologous antagonist/killer), were upregulated. These results support the proposal that CIPN and CRCI increase with increasing taxane exposure, and identified several proteins that are altered with taxane exposure that could be implicated in their pathogenesis. In conclusion, our study provides evidence for progressive neurological changes and the rationale to investigate the molecular basis for these changes with the goal of target identification for mitigation of these neurological side effects.
