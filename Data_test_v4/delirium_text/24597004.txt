24597004|t|Army anesthesia providers' perceptions of emergence delirium after general anesthesia in service members.
24597004|a|The primary aim of this study was to investigate emergence delirium (ED) in service members, through the perceptions of active duty US Army anesthesia providers. The following perceptions were examined: (1) the extent and seriousness of ED in service members, (2) effects of ED on the safety of service members and operating room/postanesthesia care unit personnel, and (3) behaviors relevant to ED in service members. The study also explored the relationships between the perceived seriousness of ED, reported case experiences, and behaviors and consequences relevant to ED. This research used a descriptive correlational study design with a questionnaire survey and a convenience sample technique totaling 89 active duty Army anesthesia providers. This study found that more than 78% of active duty Army anesthesia providers have witnessed ED in their particular practice. Approximately 38% of the respondents believed that ED was a moderate problem. There was a statistically significant association between perceived severity of ED and the ED case experience. The behaviors and consequences that were often or always seen included hyperactive motor behavior, pulling at the monitoring equipment, and making disruptive movements.
