36672967|t|The Potential of ANK1 to Predict Parkinson's Disease.
36672967|a|The main cause of Parkinson's disease (PD) remains unknown and the pathologic changes in the brain limit rapid diagnosis. Herein, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (GSE8397 and GSE22491) were assessed using linear models for microarray analysis (limma). Ankyrin 1 (ANK1) was the only common gene differentially down-regulated in lateral substantia nigra (LSN), medial substantia nigra (MSN) and blood. Additionally, DEGs between high ANK1 and low ANK1 in GSE99039 were picked out and then uploaded to the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) for gene ontology (GO) functional annotation analysis. GO analysis displayed that these DEGs were mainly enriched in oxygen transport, myeloid cell development and gas transport (biological process (BP)); hemoglobin complex, haptoglobin-hemoglobin complex and cortical cytoskeleton (cellular component (CC)); and oxygen transporter activity, haptoglobin binding and oxygen binding (molecular function (MF)). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed ANK1 had good diagnostic accuracy and increased the area under the curve (AUC) value when combined with other biomarkers. Consistently, intraperitoneal injection of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropy-ridi-ne (MPTP) in C57BL/6J mice reduced ANK1 mRNA expression in both substantia nigra and blood compared to the control group. Thus, ANK1 may serve as a candidate biomarker for PD diagnosis.
