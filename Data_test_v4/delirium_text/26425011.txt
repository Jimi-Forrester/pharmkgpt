26425011|a|BACKGROUND: Leptin, a 16 kDa peptide hormone synthesized and secreted specifically from white adipose cells protects neurons against amyloid beta-induced toxicity, by increasing Apolipoprotein E (APO E)-dependent uptake of beta amyloid into the cells, thereby, protect individuals from developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). The APO E epsilon4 allele is a known genetic risk factor for AD by accelerating onset. It is estimated that the lifetime risk of developing AD increases to 29% for carriers with one epsilon4 allele and 9% for those with no epsilon4 allele. OBJECTIVES: To determine the levels of serum leptin, cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL-C), and high density lipoprotein (HDL-C) in the diagnosed cases of AD and the association of them with cognitive decline and Apolipoprotein E (APO E) genotypes in AD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Serum levels of serum leptin, cholesterol, LDL-C, and HDL-C along with APO E polymorphism were studied in 39 subjects with probable AD and 42 cognitive normal individuals. RESULTS: AD group showed significantly lower levels of leptin (P = 0.00) as compared to control group. However, there was no significant difference in cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL-C, and HDL-C levels in AD and control groups. The frequency of epsilon4 allele in AD (38.5%) was found to be significantly higher than in control (10.3%). epsilon3 allele was more frequent than epsilon4 allele in AD and control group.
