38178174|a|BACKGROUND: Inflammatory response has been recognized as a pivotal pathophysiological process during cerebral ischemia. ChemR23 signaling is involved in the pathophysiology of various inflammatory diseases. Nevertheless, the role of ChemR23 signaling in ischemic stroke remains largely unknown. METHODS: Permanent ischemic stroke mouse model was accomplished by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Resolvin E1 (RvE1) or chemerin-9 (C-9), the agonists of ChemR23, were administered by intracerebroventricular (i.c.v) injection before MCAO induction. Then, analysis of neurobehavioral deficits and brain sampling were done at Day 1 after MCAO. The brain samples were further analyzed by histological staining, immunofluorescence, RNA sequencing, ELISA, transmission electron microscope, and western blots. Furthermore, oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) was employed in SH-SY5Y to mimic MCAO in vitro, and ChemR23 signaling pathway was further studied by overexpression of ChemR23 or administration of related agonists or antagonists. Analysis of cell death and related pathway markers were performed. RESULTS: ChemR23 expression was upregulated following MCAO. Under in vitro and in vivo ischemic conditions, ChemR23 deficiency or inhibition contributed to excessive NLRP3-mediated maturation and release of IL-1beta and IL-18, as well as enhanced cleavage of GSDMD-N and neuronal pyroptosis. These influences ultimately aggravated brain injury and neuronal damage. On the other hand, ChemR23 activation by RvE1 or C-9 mitigated the above pathophysiological abnormalities in vivo and in vitro, and overexpression of ChemR23 in SH-SY5Y cells also rescued OGD-induced neuronal pyroptosis. Blockade of NLRP3 mimics the protective effects of ChemR23 activation in vitro. CONCLUSION: Our data indicated that ChemR23 modulates NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated neuronal pyroptosis in ischemic stroke. Activation of ChemR23 may serve as a promising potential target for neuroprotection in cerebral ischemia.
