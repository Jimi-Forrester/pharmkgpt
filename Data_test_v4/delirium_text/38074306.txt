38074306|t|Applications of artificial intelligence-assisted retinal imaging in systemic diseases: A literature review.
38074306|a|The retina is a vulnerable structure that is frequently affected by different systemic conditions. The main mechanisms of systemic retinal damage are either primary insult of neurons of the retina, alterations of the local vasculature, or both. This vulnerability makes the retina an important window that reflects the severity of the preexisting systemic disorders. Therefore, current imaging techniques aim to identify early retinal changes relevant to systemic anomalies to establish anticipated diagnosis and start adequate management. Artificial intelligence (AI) has become among the highly trending technologies in the field of medicine. Its spread continues to extend to different specialties including ophthalmology. Many studies have shown the potential of this technique in assisting the screening of retinal anomalies in the context of systemic disorders. In this review, we performed extensive literature search to identify the most important studies that support the effectiveness of AI/deep learning use for diagnosing systemic disorders through retinal imaging. The utility of these technologies in the field of retina-based diagnosis of systemic conditions is highlighted.
