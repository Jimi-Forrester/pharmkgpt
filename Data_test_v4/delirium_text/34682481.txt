34682481|a|The low-carbohydrate high-fat (LCHF) diet has recently been subject to attention on account of its reported influences on body composition and physical performance. However, the combined effect of LCHF with high-intensity interval training (HIIT) is unclear. A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to explore the effect of the LCHF diet combined with HIIT on human body composition (i.e., body weight (BM), body mass index (BMI), fat mass (FM), body fat percentage (BFP), fat-free mass (FFM)) and maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max). Online libraries (PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, EBSCO, CNKI, Wan Fang) were used to search initial studies until July 2021, from which 10 out of 2440 studies were included. WMD served as the effect size with a confidence interval value of 95%. The results of meta-analysis showed a significant reduction in BM (WMD = -5.299; 95% CI: -7.223, -3.376, p = 0.000), BMI (WMD = -1.150; 95% CI: -2.225, -0.075, p = 0.036), BFP (WMD = -2.787; 95% CI: -4.738, -0.835, p = 0.005) and a significant increase in VO2max (WMD = 3.311; 95% CI: 1.705, 4.918, p = 0.000), while FM (WMD = -2.221; 95% CI: -4.582, 0.139, p = 0.065) and FFM (WMD = 0.487; 95% CI: -3.512, 4.469, p = 0.814) remained unchanged. In conclusion, the LCHF diet combined with HIIT can reduce weight and fat effectively. This combination is sufficient to prevent muscle mass loss during LCHF, and further enhance VO2max. Further research might be required to clarify the effect of other types of exercise on body composition and physical performance during LCHF.
