36306386|a|INTRODUCTION: Functional connectivity (FC)-which reflects relationships between neural activity in different brain regions-has been used to explore the functional architecture of the brain in neurodegenerative disorders. Although an increasing number of studies have explored FC changes in behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), there is no focused, in-depth review about FC in bvFTD. METHODS: Comprehensive literature search and narrative review to summarize the current field of FC in bvFTD. RESULTS: (1) Decreased FC within the salience network (SN) is the most consistent finding in bvFTD; (2) FC changes extend beyond the SN and affect the interplay between networks; (3) results within the Default Mode Network are mixed; (4) the brain as a network is less interconnected and less efficient in bvFTD; (5) symptoms, functional impairment, and cognition are associated with FC; and (6) the functional architecture resembles patterns of neuropathological spread. CONCLUSIONS: FC has potential as a biomarker, and future studies are expected to advance the field with multicentric initiatives, longitudinal designs, and methodological advances.
