33208090|t|Factors influencing the deterioration from cognitive decline of normal aging to dementia among nursing home residents.
33208090|a|BACKGROUND: A dearth of differential research exists regarding the determinants of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and moderate cognitive impairment or dementia among nursing home residents. This study aimed to identify and examine the association between medical factors (number of comorbidities, hospitalization, disability, depression, frailty and quality of life) and moderate cognitive impairment or dementia in nursing homes residents. METHODS: A cross-sectional design was used in this study. Convenience sampling of 182 participants was conducted in nursing homes located in the central part of Jordan. Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) was used to screen both MCI and moderate cognitive impairment or dementia. Bivariate analysis, including t-test and ANOVA test, and logistic and linear regression models were used to examine and identify the medical factors associated with moderate cognitive impairment or dementia compared to mild cognitive impairment. RESULTS: Most nursing home residents had MCI (87.4%) compared to a few with moderate cognitive impairment or dementia. Age (t = - 2.773), number of comorbidities (t = - 4.045), depression (t = - 4.809), frailty (t = - 4.038), and quality of life physical (t = 3.282) and mental component summaries (t = 2.469) were significantly different between the stages of cognitive impairment. Marital status (t = - 4.050, p <  0.001), higher-income (t = 3.755, p <  0.001), recent hospitalization (t = 2.622,p = 0.01), depression (t = - 2.737, p = 0.007), and frailty (t = 2.852, p = 0.005) were significantly associated with mental ability scores among nursing home residents. CONCLUSION: The coexistence of comorbidities and depression among nursing home residents with MCI necessitates prompt management by healthcare providers to combat depressive symptoms in order to delay the dementia trajectory among at-risk residents.
