39000543|t|Exploring the Regulation of Cytochrome P450 in SH-SY5Y Cells: Implications for the Onset of Neurodegenerative Diseases.
39000543|a|Human individual differences in brain cytochrome P450 (CYP) metabolism, including induction, inhibition, and genetic variation, may influence brain sensitivity to neurotoxins and thus participate in the onset of neurodegenerative diseases. The aim of this study was to explore the modulation of CYPs in neuronal cells. The experimental approach was focused on differentiating human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells into a phenotype resembling mature dopamine neurons and investigating the effects of specific CYP isoform induction. The results demonstrated that the differentiation protocols using retinoic acid followed by phorbol esters or brain-derived neurotrophic factor successfully generated SH-SY5Y cells with morphological neuronal characteristics and increased neuronal markers (NeuN, synaptophysin, beta-tubulin III, and MAO-B). qRT-PCR and Western blot analysis showed that expression of the CYP 1A1, 3A4, 2D6, and 2E1 isoforms was detectable in undifferentiated cells, with subsequent increases in CYP 2E1, 2D6, and 1A1 following differentiation. Further increases in the 1A1, 2D6, and 2E1 isoforms following beta-naphthoflavone treatment and 1A1 and 2D6 isoforms following ethanol treatment were evident. These results demonstrate that CYP isoforms can be modulated in SH-SY5Y cells and suggest their potential as an experimental model to investigate the role of CYPs in neuronal processes involved in the development of neurodegenerative diseases.
