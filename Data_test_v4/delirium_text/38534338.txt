38534338|a|Stem cell maintenance and differentiation can be regulated via the differential activity of transcription factors within stem cells and their progeny. For these factors to be active, they need to be transported from their site of synthesis in the cytoplasm into the nucleus. A tissue-specific requirement for factors involved in nuclear importation is a potential mechanism to regulate stem cell differentiation. We have undertaken a characterization of male sterile importin alpha 1 (Dalpha1) null alleles in Drosophila and found that Dalpha1 is required for maintaining germline stem cells (GSCs) in the testis niche. The loss of GSCs can be rescued by ectopic expression of Dalpha1 within the germline but the animals are still infertile, indicating a second role for Dalpha1 in spermatogenesis. Expression of a Dalpha1 dominant negative transgene in GSCs confirmed a functional requirement for Dalpha1 in GSC maintenance but expression of the transgene in differentiating spermatogonia did not exhibit a phenotype indicating a specific role for Dalpha1 within GSCs. Our data indicate that Dalpha1 is utilized as a regulatory protein within GSCs to facilitate nuclear importation of proteins that maintain the stem cell pool.
