38525754|a|INTRODUCTION: Adopting healthy lifestyle behaviors has the potential to slow cognitive decline in older adults by reducing risks associated with dementia. Curriculum-based group health coaching may aid in establishing behavior change centered for dementia risk factors. METHODS: In this pilot clinical care patient group study (n = 6), we examined the effects of a six-month online Cognitive Health Program combined with a weekly telehealth support group led by the course creator, and personalized health optimization by a collaborating physician, in older adults with subjective cognitive decline. Cognition was assessed at baseline and post-intervention using a computerized battery. RESULTS: Cognitive changes were estimated with nonparametric tests and effect sizes (Cohen's d). Results showed significant improvements in global cognition (p < 0.03, d = 1.6), spatial planning (p < 0.01, d = 2.3), and visuospatial processing (p < 0.05, d = 1.1) compared to baseline. Participants reported high levels of satisfaction with the virtual group format and online curriculum. CONCLUSIONS: This small pilot study suggests that a virtual six-month personalized health coaching group with self-paced online health education is feasible and potentially efficacious for improving cognition in participants with subjective cognitive complaints. This format may facilitate behavior change to slow cognitive decline. Future studies should include a control group, a larger, more diverse sample as well as assessing mood and other subjective measures.
