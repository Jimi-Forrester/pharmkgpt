38150450|a|BACKGROUND: Anxiety is a common preoperative symptom in children with simple congenital heart disease (SCHD). Music therapy shows potential as a non-drug intervention. However, it is unclear how it impacts the level of cooperation during the induction of anesthesia and preoperative anxiety, as well as the factors that influence its effectiveness. Therefore, we will conduct a comprehensive review and meta-analysis to assess the impact of music therapy on the level of cooperation during anesthesia induction and preoperative anxiety in children with SCHD. METHODS: Electronic searches will be conducted through various databases including PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Medline, and CNKI to gather randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining the impact of music therapy on the level of cooperation during anesthesia induction and preoperative anxiety among children with SCHD. Two evaluators will independently review the literature, extract information, and assess the risk of bias in the included studies. Afterwards, data analysis will be conducted using Stata 14.0 software and Revman 5.4 software. The results will be based on random-effects models. The reliability and quality of evidence will be evaluated by using the Grading of Recommendations, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system. Heterogeneity will be examined by subgroup analysis stratified by age, gender ratio, type of surgery, drop-out rate, measurement tools, and country of origin. We will assess potential publication bias using funnel plot symmetrical and Begg's ang Egger's regression tests. DISCUSSION: Given the multiple advantages that may be associated with music therapy, this therapy may be a desirable alternative to existing therapies for preoperative cooperation and anxiety issues in children with SCHD. We hope that this systematic review will guide clinical decision-making for future efforts related to coping with preoperative fit and anxiety in children with SCHD.
