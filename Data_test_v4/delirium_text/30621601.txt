30621601|a|BACKGROUND: It has been reported that postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is correlated with the degeneration of the central nervous system, oxidative stress, inflammation, and endocrine and immune dysfunction. Increased age, predisposed comorbidity, long surgery time, and prolonged stay in the intensive care unit have been reported to be risk factors for developing POCD for cardiac surgery. In the present study, the risk factors of early POCD after colorectal surgery were investigated. METHODS: Eighty patients, who provided informed consents for their participation in this study, were enrolled and received colorectal surgery under general anesthesia. Neuropsychological tests were performed preoperatively and on postoperative day seven. The risk factors for POCD were analyzed using a multivariate logistic regression model. RESULTS: Nineteen patients were diagnosed with POCD (24.7%). Diabetes history (OR = 8.391 [2.208-31.882], P = 0.012), fasting over 3 days after surgery (OR = 5.236 [1.998-13.721], P = 0.001) and an SIRS score of > 3 on the second day after surgery (OR = 6.995 [1.948-25.111], P = 0.003) were risk factors for early POCD in colorectal cancer patients. CONCLUSION: The risk factors for early POCD after colorectal surgery included diabetes history, fasting over 3 days, and an SIRS score of > 3 on the second day.
