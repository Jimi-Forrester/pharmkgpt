1776754|t|Characterization of an experimental autoimmune dementia model in the rat.
1776754|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other age-related cognitive deficits are associated with autoimmune phenomena. We recently showed that AD sera contain IgG that binds specifically to the heavy molecular weight neurofilament protein (NF-H) of Torpedo cholinergic neurons. We presently examined the behavioral effects of the induction of such antibodies in rats by prolonged immunization with Torpedo cholinergic NF-H. Immunohistochemical studies revealed the accumulation of IgG in the septum and hippocampus and in white matter tracts of these rats. T-maze alternation and discrimination tests revealed that immunization impaired the short-term working memory of the rats but had no effect on their reference memory. This impairment in short-term memory was reversed by treatment with the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor physostigmine. This animal model, termed experimental autoimmune dementia (EAD), may replicate immunologically induced pathogenic processes in AD.
