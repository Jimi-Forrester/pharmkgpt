22355743|t|A transgenic mouse model for monitoring oxidative stress.
22355743|a|Oxidative stress conditions enhance the production of reactive oxygen species resulting from a variety of stimuli, and are associated with various human diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders, inflammation, and various cancers. Though such associations have been closely studied using animal models, there has been no in vivo system for monitoring oxidative stress. We have developed an oxidative stress indicator that is dually regulated by induction at the transcriptional level, and by protein stabilisation at the post-translational level in Keap1-Nrf2 pathway. In vitro, our indicator elicited an intense and specific signal to oxidative stress among various agents, in a Keap1-Nrf2-dependent manner. Moreover, the transgenic animal expressing the indicator exhibited significant signals upon oxidative stress. These results indicate the usefulness of our system as an indicator of oxidative stress both in vitro and in vivo.
