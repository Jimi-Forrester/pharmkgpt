32183657|a|Recognition of Psychiatric Symptoms in Inpatient Long-Term Care Abstract. As part of the Swiss national strategy on dementia, we investigated to which extent the needs assessment instruments RAI and BESA can early detect symptoms of depression, delirium, and behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) in long-term care facilities. While we decided that the RAI sufficiently detected depressive symptoms, we suggest to add the two-questions-test and the geriatric depression scale to the BESA assessment. The BESA evaluation had more targeted focused assessments, allowing for better identification of delirium. Neither RAI or BESA cover the whole spectrum of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia. We consider the continuous application of these assessment instruments an important step towards interdisciplinary exchange and a better treatment of residents with psychiatric symptoms.
