35748910|t|Isolated REM sleep behaviour disorder: current diagnostic procedures and emerging new technologies.
35748910|a|Isolated REM sleep behaviour disorder (iRBD) is characterised by dream enactment behaviours, such as kicking and punching while asleep, and vivid/violent dreams. It is now acknowledged as a prodromal phase of neurodegenerative disease-approximately 80% of people with iRBD will develop dementia with Lewy Bodies, Parkinson's disease or another degenerative brain disease within 10 years. It is important that neurologists and other clinicians understand how to make an early accurate diagnosis of iRBD so that affected people can have the opportunity to take part in clinical trials. However, making a diagnosis can be clinically challenging due to a variety of reasons, including delayed referral, symptom overlap with other disorders, and uncertainty about how to confirm a diagnosis. Several methods of assessment are available, such as clinical interview, screening questionnaires and video polysomnography or 'sleep study'. This review aims to support clinical neurologists in assessing people who present with symptoms suggestive of iRBD. We describe the usefulness and limitations of each diagnostic method currently available in clinical practice, and present recent research on the utility of new wearable technologies to assist with iRBD diagnosis, which may offer a more practical assessment method for clinicians. This review highlights the importance of thorough clinical investigation when patients present with suspected iRBD and emphasises the need for easier access to diagnostic procedures for accurate and early diagnosis.
