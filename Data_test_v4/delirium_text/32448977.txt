32448977|a|Curcumin, a major component of Indian saffron through clinical studies, revealed its neuroprotective effect in neurodegenerative diseases. However, it has not been utilized alone orally due to its low bioavailability. There are certain strategies to overcome the drawbacks such as poor absorption and low aqueous solubility. Many strategies are utilized to increase the systemic availability of curcumin. Among them, the steady intestinal and liver metabolism of curcumin by a curcumin adjuvant (enzyme inhibitor/inducer) is an important and less engrossed strategy for improving the overall systemic bioavailability of curcumin. Here, we assess the effect of probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus as a curcumin adjuvant (potentiate the effect of curcumin) in scopolamine-induced dementia in mice. To induce amnesia, scopolamine was used in a mouse model (1 mg/kg, daily for 10 days i.p.). After execution of behavioural tests (Morris water maze test), brains and liver were isolated for further neurochemical and histopathology examination. Our results showed a significant increase in antioxidant enzyme levels in curcumin with a probiotic group compared with curcumin alone. Besides, histopathology study results showed less neuronal damage of curcumin with probiotics as compared with the curcumin and scopolamine alone groups. Additionally, curcumin with probiotics improved memory and cognitive functions in the behavioural study with the significance of p <= 0.0001. In conclusion, curcumin with probiotics has greater activity as compared with curcumin alone and reverses the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD).
