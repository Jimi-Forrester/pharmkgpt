32166659|a|Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a major serine/threonine phosphatase which participates in the regulation of multiple cellular processes. As a confirmed tumor suppressor, PP2A activity is downregulated in tumors and its re-activation can induce apoptosis of cancer cells. In the brains of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, decreased PP2A activity also plays a key role in promoting tau hyperphosphorylation and Abeta generation. In this review, we discussed compounds aiming at modulating PP2A activity in the treatment of cancer or AD. The upstream factors that inactivate PP2A in diseases have not been fully elucidated and further studies are needed. It will help for the refinement and development of novel and clinically tractable PP2A-targeted compounds or therapies for the treatment of tumor and AD.
