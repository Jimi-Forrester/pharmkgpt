39057410|t|Marine-Derived Lipases for Enhancing Enrichment of Very-Long-Chain Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids with Reference to Omega-3 Fatty Acids.
39057410|a|Omega-3 fatty acids are essential fatty acids that are not synthesised by the human body and have been linked with the prevention of chronic illnesses such as cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. However, the current dietary habits of the majority of the population include lower omega-3 content compared to omega-6, which does not promote good health. To overcome this, pharmaceutical and nutraceutical companies aim to produce omega-3-fortified foods. For this purpose, various approaches have been employed to obtain omega-3 concentrates from sources such as fish and algal oil with higher amounts of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Among these techniques, enzymatic enrichment using lipase enzymes has gained tremendous interest as it is low in capital cost and simple in operation. Microorganism-derived lipases are preferred as they are easily produced due to their higher growth rate, and they hold the ability to be manipulated using genetic modification. This review aims to highlight the recent studies that have been carried out using marine lipases for the enrichment of omega-3, to provide insight into future directions. Overall, the covalent bond-based lipase immobilization to various support materials appears most promising; however, greener and less expensive options need to be strengthened.
