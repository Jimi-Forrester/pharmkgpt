31538958|a|In humans, oxidative stress is involved in the development of diabetes, cancer, hypertension, Alzheimers' disease, and heart failure. One of the mechanisms in the cellular defence against oxidative stress is the activation of the Nrf2-antioxidant response element (ARE) signalling pathway. Computation of activity, efficacy, and potency score of ARE signalling pathway and to propose a multi-level prediction scheme for the same is the main aim of the study as it contributes in a big amount to the improvement of oxidative stress in humans. Applying the process of knowledge discovery from data, required knowledge is gathered and then machine learning techniques are applied to propose a multi-level scheme. The validation of the proposed scheme is done using the K-fold cross-validation method and an accuracy of 90% is achieved for prediction of activity score for ARE molecules which determine their power to refine oxidative stress.
