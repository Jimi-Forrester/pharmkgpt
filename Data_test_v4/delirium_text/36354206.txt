36354206|t|Cognitive function and delirium following sevoflurane or propofol anesthesia for valve replacement surgery: A multicenter randomized controlled trial.
36354206|a|Cognitive dysfunction is a common postoperative neurological complication in patients undergoing valve replacement surgery. This study aimed to compare the effects of sevoflurane versus propofol-based total intravenous anesthesia on the incidence of cognitive dysfunction following valve replacement surgery. This multicenter, randomized, controlled double-blinded study was conducted in three teaching hospitals in China. Patients receiving on-pump valve replacement surgery were enrolled. Stratified block randomization was used to randomly assign patients 1:1 to receive sevoflurane (1.0-1.5 MAC) or propofol (2.0-3.0 mg/kg/h) for anesthesia maintenance. The primary outcome was the incidence of cognitive dysfunction assessed by four cognitive tests before, as well as 7-14 days after surgery. Patients were randomly assigned to receive sevoflurane anesthesia (n = 144) or propofol-based total intravenous anesthesia (n = 145). The incidence of postoperative cognitive dysfunction in the sevoflurane anesthesia group (31.9%) was significantly lower than that in the total intravenous anesthesia group (43.4%; relative risk 0.61, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.38-0.97, p = 0.044). There was no difference in the incidence of delirium between patients receiving sevoflurane and total intravenous anesthesia (27.8% [35/144] vs. 25.9% [35/145], 1.10, 95% CI: 0.64 to 1.90, p = 0.736). There was a significant difference in the Katz Index on day 3 after surgery (3 [0.9) vs. 3 (1.0], 0.095, 95% CI: 0.05 to 0.43, p = 0.012). No difference was observed in other outcomes between the two groups. For patients undergoing on-pump valve replacement surgery, sevoflurane anesthesia had a smaller effect on cognitive function and independence in daily life activities compared with propofol anesthesia.
