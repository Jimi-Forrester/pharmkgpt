24985739|a|The disruption of Abeta homeostasis, which results in the accumulation of neurotoxic amyloids, is the fundamental cause of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Molecular chaperones play a critical role in controlling undesired protein misfolding and maintaining intricate proteostasis in vivo. Inspired by a natural molecular chaperone, an artificial chaperone consisting of mixed-shell polymeric micelles (MSPMs) has been devised with tunable surface properties, serving as a suppressor of AD. Taking advantage of biocompatibility, selectivity toward aberrant proteins, and long blood circulation, these MSPM-based chaperones can maintain Abeta homeostasis by a combination of inhibiting Abeta fibrillation and facilitating Abeta aggregate clearance and simultaneously reducing Abeta-mediated neurotoxicity. The balance of hydrophilic/hydrophobic moieties on the surface of MSPMs is important for their enhanced therapeutic effect.
