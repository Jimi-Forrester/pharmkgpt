26396692|t|Novel Fluorinated 8-Hydroxyquinoline Based Metal Ionophores for Exploring the Metal Hypothesis of Alzheimer's Disease.
26396692|a|Zinc, copper, and iron ions are involved in amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposition and stabilization in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Consequently, metal binding agents that prevent metal-Abeta interaction and lead to the dissolution of Abeta deposits have become well sought therapeutic and diagnostic targets. However, direct intervention between diseases and metal abnormalities has been challenging and is partially attributed to the lack of a suitable agent to determine and modify metal concentration and distribution in vivo. In the search of metal ionophores, we have identified several promising chemical entities by strategic fluorination of 8-hydroxyquinoline drugs, clioquinol, and PBT2. Compounds 15-17 and 28-30 showed exceptional metal ionophore ability (6-40-fold increase of copper uptake and >2-fold increase of zinc uptake) and inhibition of zinc induced Abeta oligomerization (EC50s < ~5 muM). These compounds are suitable for further development as drug candidates and/or positron emission tomography (PET) biomarkers if radiolabeled with (18)F.
