38569102|a|PURPOSE: Older adults with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) are at high risk for acute medical problems and their health trajectories frequently include hospital admission and care in a skilled nursing facility (SNF). Their health trajectories after SNF discharge are poorly understood. Therefore, in the current study, we sought to describe health trajectories and factors associated with hospital read-missions for older adults with ADRD during the 30 days following SNF discharge. METHOD: We conducted a secondary analysis of data from a clinical trial of transitional care of older adults with transitions from SNF to home and assisted living. A multiple case study design was used in the analysis of the health trajectories of 49 SNF patients with ADRD, 51% discharged from SNF to their own home, 34% discharged to a family member's home, and 15% transferred to assisted living. RESULTS: Within 30 days of discharge, 20% of patients with ADRD experienced new or recurrent acute needs and hospital readmission. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest the need for nursing interventions to support patients with ADRD during care transitions, such as focusing care on the patient-caregiver dyad, providing transitional care, referring patients for palliative care consultation, and conducting nurse-led research to improve care transitions of these patients and their caregivers.
