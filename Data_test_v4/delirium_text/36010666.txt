36010666|t|Proteostasis Deregulation in Neurodegeneration and Its Link with Stress Granules: Focus on the Scaffold and Ribosomal Protein RACK1.
36010666|a|The role of protein misfolding, deposition, and clearance has been the dominant topic in the last decades of investigation in the field of neurodegeneration. The impairment of protein synthesis, along with RNA metabolism and RNA granules, however, are significantly emerging as novel potential targets for the comprehension of the molecular events leading to neuronal deficits. Indeed, defects in ribosome activity, ribosome stalling, and PQC-all ribosome-related processes required for proteostasis regulation-can contribute to triggering stress conditions and promoting the formation of stress granules (SGs) that could evolve in the formation of pathological granules, usually occurring during neurodegenerating effects. In this review, the interplay between proteostasis, mRNA metabolism, and SGs has been explored in a neurodegenerative context with a focus on Alzheimer's disease (AD), although some defects in these same mechanisms can also be found in frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), which are discussed here. Finally, we highlight the role of the receptor for activated C kinase 1 (RACK1) in these pathologies and note that, besides its well characterized function as a scaffold protein, it has an important role in translation and can associate to stress granules (SGs) determining cell fate in response to diverse stress stimuli.
