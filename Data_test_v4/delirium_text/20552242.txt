20552242|t|Atypical Alzheimer's disease: a case report.
20552242|a|This paper deals with an unusual case of Alzheimer's disease with early onset, no family history, myoclonus, tonic generalized seizures and pseudo-periodic spikes on EEG. The demise occurred after 8 years of progressive cognitive deterioration; the pathological examination showed "Pick-like" atrophy, neurofibrillary tangles, senile plaques, congophilic angiopathy and cerebellar amyloid plaques. The genetical research could not support the hypothesis of a mutation of Presenilin 1 and 2 genes. Anyway, the peculiarity of the phenotype is worthy to be described even in the absence of specific molecular findings.
