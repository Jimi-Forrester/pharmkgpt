34360919|t|Hypoxia and the Receptor for Advanced Glycation End Products (RAGE) Signaling in Cancer.
34360919|a|Hypoxia is characterized by an inadequate supply of oxygen to tissues, and hypoxic regions are commonly found in solid tumors. The cellular response to hypoxic conditions is mediated through the activation of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) that control the expression of a large number of target genes. Recent studies have shown that the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) participates in hypoxia-dependent cellular adaptation. We review recent evidence on the role of RAGE signaling in tumor biology under hypoxic conditions.
