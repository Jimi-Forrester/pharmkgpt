37773868|a|This study aims to assess knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and practices (KABP) among China mainland allergic rhinitis (AR) participants regarding their willingness to use acupuncture. Little is known about the understanding, attitudes, beliefs and practices of people with AR in China. A questionnaire was designed and administered to AR participants in mainland China to gather information about KABP regarding acupuncture use. A total of 324 valid questionnaires were collected from 30 provinces on the Chinese mainland. We recorded basic information and data about AR. The questionnaire designed according to KABP theory and with excellent reliability (Cronbach alpha coefficient: 0.725) and validity (KMO: 0.819). Knowledge: Fifty-five percent (179) of respondents reported knowing about acupuncture. The majority (172) knew that acupuncture was used for AR; 119 had received acupuncture for AR, and about 66% were aware of acupuncture. Attitudes and beliefs: Seventy percent of patients were willing to recommend acupuncture for AR to family and friends. Practice: Approximately 75% of respondents were willing to undergo acupuncture if they knew it was effective for AR. Approximately 25% of the respondents answered "Do it a few times and see how it works," "Do several treatments depending on how much they can afford," or "It is up to the doctor to decide". Correlation analysis: Those who identified with traditional Chinese medicine showed a robust willingness to recommend acupuncture for treating other diseases to family and friends (R = 0.718, P < .01) and a robust willingness to recommend acupuncture for AR to their families and friends (R = 0.564, P < .01). Acupuncture for AR has shown excellent awareness, recommendation and acceptance in mainland China. Efficacy, affordability, and trust in doctors were the 3 key factors that led respondents to choose acupuncture for their AR. Identification with traditional Chinese medicine culture significantly influenced attitudes, leading to AR recommendations and acceptance of acupuncture.
