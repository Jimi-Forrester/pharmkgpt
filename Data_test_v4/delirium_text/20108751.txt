20108751|a|From a historical point of view, medicine (in modem society) has set its mission as to cure diseases--medical-type issues--and to ignore patient's condition--illness endurance. By accepting this point of view with reference to their problem, patients have entered some sort of conspiracy of silence and started ignoring the emotional reaction to their medical problems (or to cancel these reactions), regarding them as irrelevant to the problem itself. This approach is also reinforced by the medical pattern that absolutely contests the idea that mind influences the body in a very important way. Another equally unproductive ideology is the idea that people could cure themselves alone even of the most serious illnesses by feeling happy or by thinking in a positive manner, or the idea that people are guilty of getting sick. This attitude resulted in creating a widespread confusion and in significant misunderstandings regarding the extent to which illness can be influenced by mind, at times even blaming someone for having got ill. In the world of illness, emotions have supremacy and fear is the only "thought". We can be so fragile emotionally speaking when we suffer from some illness because part of our mental good-humor is partially based on the illusion of invulnerability. Illness--especially a severe one--destroys this illusion and cancels the premise that our world is one in which existence is completely secure. All of a sudden, we feel thick with weaknesses, we feel helpless and vulnerable (Dixon, 1992). There is a problem when the medical personnel ignore the way patients react from an emotional point of view, even though they should exclusively take care of our physical state. This lack of interest in the emotional reality of an illness neglects something obvious which shows that the emotional state of people can play a significant role as to their vulnerability towards illness and during the recovery process (Ciofu et al., 1978). There is already a scientific basis according to which a limit to the medical efficiency appears not only during the prophylactic process but also during treatment. This efficiency can be enhanced by curing the emotional state of the patient at the same time with his/her medical state. Unfortunately, too often, the medical personnel is in a hurry or unsympathetic towards patients' despair and, seemingly, things get worse indeed in the midst of the medical system harsh reality, medical system that depends too much on time keeping performed by accountants (Ciurea et al., 2009).
