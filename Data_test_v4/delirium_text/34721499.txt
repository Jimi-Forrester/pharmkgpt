34721499|a|INTRODUCTION: Most behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) scales have copyright issues and are difficult for care staff to use in daily care settings because they were primarily designed for physicians. Therefore, an easier tool for care staff is required. This study aimed to develop and validate the BPSD questionnaire 13-item version (BPSD13Q). METHODS: We obtained data from 444 people with dementia living in group homes in Japan using the BPSD plus questionnaire (BPSD + Q; 27-item version) and Neuropsychiatric Inventory Nursing Home version (NPI-NH). We selected appropriate items to make a short-form version of the BPSD + Q and examined the construct validity, internal consistency, and criterion-related validity of the questionnaire. RESULTS: By the pilot review, research on correlations with similar items from comparable scales, and factor analysis, we reduced 27 items to 13 items (BPSD13Q). The BPSD13Q and BPSD13Q-distress (BPSD13Q-D) showed good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.76 and 0.80, respectively). Moreover, the BPSD13Q was positively correlated with the NPI-NH (r = 0.72, p < 0.001) and BPSD + Q (r = 0.95, p < 0.001). The BPSD13Q-D was positively correlated with the NPI-NH-caregiver distress (r = 0.74, p < 0.001) and BPSD + Q-distress (r = 0.96, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: We developed and validated the BPSD13Q, which is a short-form version of the BPSD + Q and is downloadable. The BPSD13Q may make BPSD evaluations easier for the care staff.
