37753318|a|Although most patients prefer dying at home, patients whose condition rapidly becomes critical need care in the intensive care unit (ICU), and it is rare for them to die at home with their families. Therefore, interest in hospice and palliative care for patients in the ICU is increasing. Hospice and palliative care (PC) is necessary for all patients with life-threatening diseases. The following patients need palliative care in the ICU: patients with chronic critical illnesses who need tracheostomy, percutaneous gastrostomy tube, and extracorporeal life support; patients aged 80 years or older; stage 4 cancer patients; patients with specific acute diseases with a poor prognosis (e.g., anoxic brain injury and intracerebral hemorrhage requiring mechanical ventilation); and patients for whom the attending physician expects a poor prognosis. There are two PC models-a consultative model and an integrative model-in the ICU setting. Since these two models have advantages and disadvantages, it is necessary to apply the model that best fits each hospital's circumstances. Furthermore, interdisciplinary decision-making between the ICU care team and PC specialists should be strengthened to increase the provision of hospice and palliative care services for patients expected to have poor outcomes and their families.
