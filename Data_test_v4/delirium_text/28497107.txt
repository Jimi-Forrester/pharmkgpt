28497107|a|INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is defined by the progressive accumulation of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain which precedes cognitive decline by years. METHODS: Using amyloid biomarkers, chemical modeling, mouse behavioral models, and drug development techniques we investigate the properties of NGP 555, a clinical-stage gamma-secretase modulator. RESULTS: NGP 555 shifts amyloid peptide production to the smaller, non-aggregating forms of amyloid. Our preclinical studies show beneficial effects on amyloid biomarkers, pathology, and cognition. NGP 555 has successfully completed chemistry, pharmacology, toxicity, metabolism, and safety studies. DISCUSSION: Abundant data support Abeta42 as a target for prophylactic or early-stage intervention therapies in AD. The gamma-secretase modulator, NGP 555 is being actively developed in human clinical trials for the prevention of Alzheimer's disease with the overall aim to achieve an appropriate balance of potency/efficacy on reducing the toxic forms of amyloid versus safety.
