30160939|a|The detection of protein biomarkers for the clinical diagnosis of diseases requires selective and sensitive methodologies and biosensors that can be easily used at pathology laboratories and points of care. An ideal methodology would be able to conduct multimode screening of low and high concentrations of proteins in biological fluids using recyclable platforms. In this work, we demonstrate a novel nanosensing methodology for the dual detection of cystatin C (CST-C), as a protein biomarker model, in blood plasma by surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy and electrochemistry. The new methodology utilizes the thiol chemistry of biomolecules to develop a target-specific and recyclable extractor chip for the rapid isolation of protein biomarkers from blood plasma. This is followed by the rapid reduction of the disulfide bonds within the isolated protein to influence its oriented immobilization onto a conductive gold coated silicon nanopillar substrate via stable gold-sulfur (Au-S) bonds. The oriented immobilization led to reproducible surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) measurements of the reduced protein (RSD = 3.8%) and allowed for its direct electrochemical determination. After the SERS measurement, differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) was used to desorb the analyte from the substrate and generate a reduction current that is proportional to its concentration. CST-C was determined down to 1 pM and 62.5 nM by SERS and DPV, respectively, which satisfies the requirements for monitoring Alzheimer's and kidney failure diseases. The new dual nanosensing methodology has strong potential for miniaturization in a lab-on-a-chip platform for the screening of many protein biomarkers that have a disulfide bond structure.
