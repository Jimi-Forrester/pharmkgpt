23532874|t|Humanin binds MPP8: mapping interaction sites of the peptide and protein.
23532874|a|Humanin (HN), a 24-amino acid peptide encoded by the mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene, was discovered by screening a cDNA library from the occipital cortex of a patient with Alzheimer's disease (AD) for a protection factor against AD-relevant insults. Earlier, using the yeast two-hybrid system, we have identified the M-phase phosphoprotein 8 (MPP8) as a binding partner for HN. In the present work, we further confirmed interaction of HN with MPP8 in co-immunoprecipitation experiments and localized an MPP8-binding site in the region between 5 and 12 aa. of HN. We have also shown that an MPP8 fragment (residues 431-560) is sufficient to bind HN. Further studies on functional consequences of the interaction between the potential oncopetide and the oncoprotein may elucidate some aspects of the molecular mechanisms of carcinogenesis.
