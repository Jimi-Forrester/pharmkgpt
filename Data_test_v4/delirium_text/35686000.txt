35686000|a|This review highlights using nanotechnology in increasing the bioavailability of AP (Apigenin) to enhance its therapeutic efficacy in breast cancer treatment. Breast cancer is one of the most leading causes of cancer death in women both in developed and developing countries. According to several epidemiological and clinical trial studies that indicate progestin-stimulated breast cancer in post-menopausal women; it is necessary to determine compounds to suppress or attenuate the tumor-promoting effects of progestins in breast cells. For this purpose, using the natural anti-progestins, including AP compared with the chemical ones could be significantly effective due to the lack of toxicities and contradiction effects. However, AP is categorized as a Class II drug of Biopharmaceutical Classification System with low solubility in water which limited its therapeutic effects. Therefore, nanotechnology due to the presentation of remarkable properties has overcome this limitation through enhanced the solubility and bioavailability of AP. In this regard, various nanocarriers such as nanocrystals, micelles, liposomes, PLGA, etc., have highlighted the significantly increased bioavailability and therapeutic efficacy of AP. Therefore, we will focus on the anticancer effects of AP in breast cancers, including involved mechanisms, the chemistry of AP and its bioavailability, finally different nanostructure systems to enhance the bioavailability of AP.
