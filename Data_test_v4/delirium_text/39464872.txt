39464872|a|Background: Cases of dementia are increasing rapidly; music-based interventions have shown promise to support some of the negative outcomes. Methods: This research assesses the potential of adolescent musicians to deliver Project Unmute, a virtual, intergenerational music-based intervention for older adults with Alzheimer's disease and dementia. To assess the feasibility of the intervention, the research team calculated attendance of intervention sessions, assessed intervention preparation, and measured adherence during intervention delivery. Results: Eight adolescent musicians participated, ages 14-18. They attended 80/80 intervention sessions, were prepared for 32/32 mentorship sessions, and delivered 24/24 intervention ingredients. Conclusion: This research suggests that adolescent musicians have the potential to administer a well-defined music-based intervention with high adherence. There is potential for future research to explore the potential for the scalable population of adolescent musicians as successful facilitators of music-based interventions for older adults with Alzheimer's disease and dementia.
