28349119|a|INTRODUCTION: Changes in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tau and amyloid beta (Abeta)42 accompany development of Alzheimer's brain pathology. Robust tau and Abeta42 immunoassays were developed to establish a tau/Abeta42 cutoff distinguishing mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) subjects from healthy elderly control (HC) subjects. METHODS: A CSF tau/Abeta42 cutoff criteria was chosen, which distinguished the groups and maximized concordance with amyloid PET. Performance was assessed using an independent validation cohort. RESULTS: A tau/Abeta42 = 0.215 cutoff provided 94.8% sensitivity and 77.7% specificity. Concordance with PET visual reads was estimated at 86.9% in a ~50% PET positive population. In the validation cohort, the cutoff demonstrated 78.4% sensitivity and 84.9% specificity to distinguish the AD and HC populations. DISCUSSION: A tau/Abeta42 cutoff with acceptable sensitivity and specificity distinguished HC from mild-to-moderate AD subjects and maximized concordance to brain amyloidosis. The defined cutoff demonstrated that CSF analysis may be useful as a surrogate to imaging assessment of AD pathology.
