34660152|t|Primary Spontaneous Inferior Clival Cerebrospinal Fluid Leak.
34660152|a|Primary, spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks secondary to defects in the clivus are exceedingly rare. Additionally, primary, spontaneous CSF leaks are typically present in obese women with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). In the present study, we report the first case of a primary, spontaneous CSF leak in the inferior-posterior wall of the clivus in an atypical patient with a BMI of 18.9 kg/m2 without IIH. Accurate diagnoses of CSF leaks are imperative in the context of preventing meningitis, and delays in diagnosis and treatment are associated with worse outcomes. Improved characterization of rare, spontaneous CSF leaks may prove beneficial in correctly diagnosing affected patients.
