38006313|a|While Parkinson's disease remains clinically defined by cardinal motor symptoms resulting from nigrostriatal degeneration, it is now appreciated that Parkinson's disease commonly consists of multiple pathologies, but it is unclear where these co-pathologies occur early in disease and whether they are responsible for the nigrostriatal degeneration. For the past number of years, we have been studying a well-characterized cohort of subjects with motor impairment that we have termed mild motor deficits. Motor deficits were determined on a modified and validated Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale III, but were insufficient in degree to diagnose Parkinson's disease. However, in our past studies, cases in this cohort had a selection bias as both a clinical syndrome in between no motor deficits and Parkinson's disease, plus nigral Lewy pathology as defined post-mortem, were required for inclusion. Therefore, in the current study, we only based inclusion on the presence of a clinical phenotype with mild motor impairment insufficient to diagnose PD. Then, we divided this group further based upon whether or not subjects had a synucleinopathy in the nigrostriatal system. Here we demonstrate that loss of nigral dopaminergic neurons, loss of putamenal dopaminergic innervation, and loss of TH-phenotype in the substantia nigra and putamen occur equally in mild motor deficit groups with and without nigral alpha-synuclein aggregates. Indeed, the common feature of these two groups is that both have similar degrees of AT8 positive phospho-tau, a pathology not seen in the nigrostriatal system of aged-matched controls. These findings were confirmed with early (tau Ser208 phosphorylation) and late (tau Ser396/Ser404 phosphorylation) tau markers. This suggests that the initiation of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurodegeneration occurs independently of alpha-synuclein aggregation and can be tau mediated.
