32444548|a|There has been much interest in the clinical trial of GV972 for treatment of Alzheimer's disease in that the data have indicated that the compound is protective against cognitive decline. This effect has been attributed to a remodelling of the gut microbiota. I suggest that the effect might be caused by an antiviral action of GV971 against herpes simplex virus type 1 in brain, which many studies have strongly implicated as having a major role in Alzheimer's disease. The antiviral action of GV971 is proposed on the basis that it is an acidic polysaccharide consisting of linear sodium oligomannurarate molecules of a range of sizes, derived from brown algae. Marine-derived polysaccharides are well known for possessing various bioactivities, including antiviral and antibacterial properties.
