35659599|a|OBJECTIVE: To explore the expression relationship and significance of long chain non-coding RNA nuclear-enriched abundant transcript 1 (LncRNA NEAT1) and miR-27a-3p in serum and cerebrospinal fluid of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: Sixty-six AD patients received by the Department of Neurology of our hospital from October 2019 to September 2021 were gathered, according to the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR) score, they were grouped into mild group (<=1 point, n = 41) and moderate-to-severe group (> 1 point, n = 25). Another 32 cases of serum and cerebrospinal fluid samples from outpatient physical examination personnel were regarded as the control group. The general materials on all subjects was recorded and cognition was assessed;real-time quantitative PCR was performed to measure the expression levels of miR-27a-3p and NEAT1 in serum and cerebrospinal fluid;enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was performed to measure the protein levels of beta-amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), beta-amyloid (Abeta) 40 and Abeta42 in cerebrospinal fluid;Spearman's method was performed to analyze the correlation of serum miR-27a-3p and NEAT1 levels with MMSE and MoCA scores;Pearson method was performed to analyze the correlation between serum miR-27a-3p and NEAT1 levels and Abeta deposition standard uptake value ratio (SUVR) and cerebrospinal fluid miR-27a-3p, NEAT1, BACE1, Abeta42 and Abeta40 levels. RESULTS: The MMSE score, MoCA score, serum miR-27a-3p level, cerebrospinal fluid miR-27a-3p, Abeta42 levels and Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio of AD patients in mild group and moderate-to-severe group were all lower than those in the control group, and the moderate-to-severe group were lower than the mild group (all P < 0.05);the serum NEAT1 level, SUVR, and cerebrospinal fluid NEAT1 and BACE1 levels were higher than those in the control group, and the moderate-to-severe group were higher than the mild group (all P < 0.05). Serum NEAT1 level in AD patients was positively correlated with SUVR, cerebrospinal fluid NEAT1 and BACE1 (r = 0.350, 0.606, 0.341, all P < 0.05);serum miR-27a-3p level was positively correlated with cerebrospinal fluid miR-27a-3p level (r = 0.695, P < 0.05), and negatively correlated with SUVR and cerebrospinal fluid BACE1 level (r = - 0.521, - 0.447, both P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The expression trends of NEAT1 and miR-27a-3p in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid of AD patients are consistent, the level of NEAT1 is increased, and the level of miR-27a-3p is decreased. The levels of the two are negatively correlated, which is related to the degree of Abeta deposition in the brain of AD patients and is involved in the progression of AD.
