36234947|a|In this paper, the confusion of the sources of medicinal materials was briefly expounded, and the differences among the varieties were pointed out. At the same time, the chemical components and pharmacological properties of Elsholtzia ciliata (Thunb.) Hyland (E. ciliata) were reviewed. The structures of 352 compounds that have been identified are listed. These mainly include flavonoids, terpenoids, phenylpropanoids, alkaloids, and other chemical components. They have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, insecticidal, antiviral, hypolipidemic, hypoglycemic, analgesic, antiarrhythmic, antitumor, antiacetylcholinesterase, and immunoregulator activities. At present, there are many researches using essential oil and alcohol extract, and the researches on antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial, and other pharmacological activities are relatively mature. This paper aims to summarize the existing research, update the research progress regarding the phytochemicals and pharmacology of E. ciliate, and to provide convenience for subsequent research.
