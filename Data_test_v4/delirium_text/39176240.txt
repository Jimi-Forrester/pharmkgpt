39176240|t|Efficacy, safety, and response predictors of Astragalus in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease: A study protocol of an assessor-blind, statistician-blind open-label randomized controlled trial.
39176240|a|Background: This pragmatic clinical trial aims to determine the efficacy and safety of add-on Astragalus membranaceus (AM) for cognition and non-cognition in patients with of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease complicated with orthostatic hypotension in orthostatic hypotension, elucidate the underlying mechanisms, identify related response predictors, and explore effective drug components. Methods: This is an add-on, assessor-blinded, parallel, pragmatic, randomized controlled trial. At least 66 adults with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) and OH aged 50-85 years will be recruited. Participants will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive 24 weeks of routine care or add-on low dose AM or add-on high dose AM group. The primary efficacy outcome will be measured by the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale, Chinese version. Secondary efficacy outcome assessment will include neuropsychological tests, blood pressure, plasma biomarkers, multimodal electroencephalograms, and neuroimaging. Safety outcome measures will include physical examinations, vital signs, electrocardiography, laboratory tests (such as hematologic and blood chemical tests), and adverse event records. Ethics and dissemination: This trial was approved and supervised by Fujian Medical University Union Hospital (2021KJCX040). Independent results, findings will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at national and international conferences. Trial registration number: NCT05647473; ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier.
