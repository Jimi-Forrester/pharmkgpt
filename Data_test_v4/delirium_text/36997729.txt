36997729|t|Curcumin and chemokines: mechanism of action and therapeutic potential in inflammatory diseases.
36997729|a|Chemokines belong to the family of cytokines with chemoattractant properties that regulate chemotaxis and leukocyte migration, as well as the induction of angiogenesis and maintenance of hemostasis. Curcumin, the major component of the Curcuma longa rhizome, has various pharmacological actions, including anti-inflammatory, immune-regulatory, anti-oxidative, and lipid-modifying properties. Chemokines and chemokine receptors are influenced/modulated by curcumin. Thus, the current review focuses on the molecular mechanisms associated with curcumin's effects on chemoattractant cytokines, as well as putting into context the many studies that have reported curcumin-mediated regulatory effects on inflammatory conditions in the organs/systems of the body (e.g., the central nervous system, liver, and cardiovascular system). Curcumin's effects on viral and bacterial infections, cancer, and adverse pregnancy outcomes are also reviewed.
