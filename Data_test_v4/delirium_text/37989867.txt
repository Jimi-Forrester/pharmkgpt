37989867|a|Oxyresveratrol has been documented benefits for neurodegenerative disease. However, the specific molecular mechanisms and pathways involved is currently limited. This study aimed to investigate the potential neuroprotective mechanisms of oxyresveratrol using rotenone-induced human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cytotoxicity. Cells were divided into the following groups: control, rotenone, and oxyresveratrol pre-treated before being exposed to rotenone. Cellular assays were performed to investigate neuroprotective effects of oxyresveratrol. The results showed that 20 muM oxyresveratrol was effective in preventing rotenone-induced cell death and decreasing ROS levels in the cells. The alteration of metabolites and pathways involved in the neuroprotective activities of oxyresveratrol were further investigated using LC-QTOF-MS/MS untargeted metabolomics approach. We hypothesized that oxyresveratrol's neuroprotective effects would be associated with neurodegenerative pathways. A total of 294 metabolites were identified. 7,8-dihydrobiopterin exhibited the highest VIP scores (VIP > 3.0; p < 0.05), thus considered a biomarker in this study. Our results demonstrated that pretreatment with oxyresveratrol upregulated the level of 7,8-dihydrobiopterin compared to the positive control. Pathway analysis verified that 7,8-dihydrobiopterin was primarily associated with phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan metabolism (impact = 1, p < 0.001), serving as essential cofactors for enzymatic function in the dopamine biosynthesis pathway. In conclusion, oxyresveratrol may be benefit for the prevention of neurodegenerative diseases by increasing 7,8-dihydrobiopterin concentration.
