18600585|t|AL-108 and AL-208, formulations of the neuroprotective NAP fragment of activity-dependent neuroprotective protein, for cognitive disorders.
18600585|a|Allon Therapeutics Inc is developing AL-108, an intranasally administered, eight-amino-acid peptide fragment (known as NAP) of activity-dependent neuroprotective protein, and AL-208, an intravenous formulation of NAP. AL-108 is undergoing phase II trials for cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia. AL-108 is also being investigated as a neuroprotective agent, including for the treatment of Parkinson's disease and ocular disease. AL-208 is undergoing phase II clinical trials for the treatment of cognitive disorder and phase I clinical trials for ocular disease and cognitive deficits associated with coronary artery bypass graft or ischemia.
