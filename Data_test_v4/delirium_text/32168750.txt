32168750|t|3D Printed Conductive Nanocellulose Scaffolds for the Differentiation of Human Neuroblastoma Cells.
32168750|a|We prepared cellulose nanofibrils-based (CNF), alginate-based and single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT)-based inks for freeform reversible embedding hydrogel (FRESH) 3D bioprinting of conductive scaffolds. The 3D printability of conductive inks was evaluated in terms of their rheological properties. The differentiation of human neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y cell line) was visualized by the confocal microscopy and the scanning electron microscopy techniques. The expression of TUBB3 and Nestin genes was monitored by the RT-qPCR technique. We have demonstrated that the conductive guidelines promote the cell differentiation, regardless of using differentiation factors. It was also shown that the electrical conductivity of the 3D printed scaffolds could be tuned by calcium-induced crosslinking of alginate, and this plays a significant role on neural cell differentiation. Our work provides a protocol for the generation of a realistic in vitro 3D neural model and allows for a better understanding of the pathological mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases.
