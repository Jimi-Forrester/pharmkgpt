21266894|t|CNS drug development: part III: future directions.
21266894|a|This column, the third in a series on central nervous system (CNS) drug development, discusses advances during the first decade of the 21st century and directions the field may take in the next 10 years. By identifying many possible new drug targets, the human genome project has created the potential to develop novel central nervous system (CNS) drugs with new mechanisms of action. At the same time, this proliferation of possible new targets has complicated the drug development process, since research has not yet provided guidance as to which targets may be most fruitful. This and other factors (eg, increasing regulatory requirements) have increased the cost and complexity of the drug development process. In addition, as more is learned about the biology of psychiatric illnesses, syndromes may be subdivided into more specific entities that are better understood from a pathophysiological and pathoetiological perspective. This is likely to lead to development of more targeted treatments focused on underlying causes of illness as well as prevention. The development of drugs for Alzheimer's disease is discussed as a possible model for future CNS drug development. We are at the beginning of an era when it is likely that the way in which CNS drugs are developed will need to be rethought, which will call for flexibility and creativity on the part of both drug developers and clinical researchers.
