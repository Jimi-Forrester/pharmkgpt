24290604|t|Genistein antagonizes inflammatory damage induced by beta-amyloid peptide in microglia through TLR4 and NF-kappaB.
24290604|a|OBJECTIVES: Microglia activation and neuroinflammation have been associated with the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB-mediated signal pathways exert key modulating roles in the inflammatory processes. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether genistein (Gen) has a neuroprotective effect against inflammatory damage induced by beta-amyloid peptide25-35 (Abeta25-35) through the TLR4 and NF-kappaB-mediated signal pathways. METHODS: BV-2 microglia cells were preincubated with Gen for 2 h and then treated with 25 muM Abeta25-35 for another 24 h. The expression of inflammatory mediators, TLR4 and NF-kappaB and the activity of NF-kappaB were measured. RESULTS: The results showed that Gen could attenuate the cytotoxicity and inflammatory damage induced by Abeta25-35. Gen also significantly reversed Abeta25-35-induced up-regulation of TLR4 and NF-kappaB expression and the DNA binding and transcriptional activities of NF-kappaB. CONCLUSION: These results indicated that Gen could alleviate the inflammation caused by Abeta25-35 treatment, which might be associated with the regulation of the TLR4/NF-kappaB signal pathway.
