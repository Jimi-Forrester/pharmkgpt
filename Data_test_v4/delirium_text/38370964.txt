38370964|a|Background: In India, only about 10% of persons with psychiatric illnesses receive evidence-based treatments. Stigma, mistrust in allopathic medicine, allegiance toward faith healers, cultural and traditional practices, and beliefs are some of the major hindrances to the treatment of mentally ill patients. Aim: To assess supernatural attitudes toward mental health among tribal and non-tribal populations. Materials and Methods: A total of 100 subjects were included in the study after informed consent, 50 of whom were tribal and 50 non-tribal. All were required to fill a self-constructed proforma, the Supernatural Attitude Questionnaire (SAQ), and the Attitudes Toward Seeking Professional Psychological Help Scale-Short Form (ATSPPH-SF). The scales were scored, compiled, and statistically analyzed. Results: The tribal and non-tribal subjects were well-matched on socio-demographic variables. The score of SAQ was significantly higher in the tribal group as compared to the non-tribal group. On the ATSPPH-SF, the scores of the two groups were not significant. Conclusion: Even though the tribal populations of India hold a higher supernatural attitude toward mental illnesses as compared to the non-tribal populations, their treatment-seeking attitude remains unaffected.
