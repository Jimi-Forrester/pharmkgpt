29755842|t|Lipopolysaccharide endotoxemia induces amyloid-beta and p-tau formation in the rat brain.
29755842|a|Amyloid beta (Abeta) plaques are not specific to Alzheimer's disease and occur with aging and neurodegenerative disorders. Soluble brain Abeta may be neuroprotective and increases in response to neuroinflammation. Sepsis is associated with neurocognitive compromise. The objective was to determine, in a rat endotoxemia model of sepsis, whether neuroinflammation and soluble Abeta production are associated with Abeta plaque and hyperphosphorylated tau deposition in the brain. Male Sprague Dawley rats received a single intraperitoneal injection of 10 mg/kg of lipopolysaccharide endotoxin (LPS). Brain and blood levels of IL-1beta, IL-6, and TNFalpha and cortical microglial density were measured in LPS-injected and control animals. Soluble brain Abeta and p-tau were compared and Abeta plaques were quantified and characterized. Brain uptake of [18F]flutemetamol was measured by phosphor imaging. LPS endotoxemia resulted in elevations of cytokines in blood and brain. Microglial density was increased in LPS-treated rats relative to controls. LPS resulted in increased soluble Abeta and in p-tau levels in whole brain. Progressive increases in morphologically-diffuse Abeta plaques occurred throughout the interval of observation (to 7-9 days post LPS). LPS endotoxemia resulted in increased [18F]flutemetamol in the cortex and increased cortex: white matter ratios of activity. In conclusion, LPS endotoxemia causes neuroinflammation, increased soluble Abeta and Abeta diffuse plaques in the brain. Abeta PET tracers may inform this neuropathology. Increased p-tau in the brain of LPS treated animals suggests that downstream consequences of Abeta plaque formation may occur. Further mechanistic and neurocognitive studies to understand the causes and consequences of LPS-induced neuropathology are warranted.
