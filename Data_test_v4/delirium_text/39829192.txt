39829192|a|Vitamin K (VitK) exists in multiple forms, with Vitamin K1 (VitK1) and Vitamin K2 (VitK2) being the most prominent. VitK1 primarily regulates clotting factors in the liver, whereas VitK2 plays a crucial role in activating extrahepatic proteins involved in various physiological processes. VitK plays a pivotal role in various physiological functions, including vascular health, bone metabolism, neuroprotection, hepatoprotection, immune response modulation, dental health, and glucose control. Particularly, activation of the matrix Gla protein and osteocalcin through VitK2 inhibits vascular calcification (VC) and promotes bone mineralization. This review provides an overview of the physiological functions of VitK2, underscoring its role in calcium metabolism modulation and its diverse effects on health. Additionally, this article provides a comprehensive overview of the beneficial functions of VitK, and discusses the significance of adequate dietary intake and oral supplementation of VitK. Particularly, emphasizing on the need for VitK2 supplementation owing to its relatively limited availability in Western diets. VitK2 supplementation effectively counters VC, enhances bone density, and offers neuroprotective, hepatoprotective, and anti-inflammatory benefits. Thus, the supplementation of VitK2, alongside dietary intake, is essential for preventive healthcare, particularly in the prevention of osteoporosis and vascular diseases. Incorporating adequate VitK2 intake highlights its significance in promoting overall well-being. Illustrated summary of the role of VitK in menopausal women.
