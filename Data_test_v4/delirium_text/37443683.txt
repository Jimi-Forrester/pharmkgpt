37443683|t|Diagnostic Efficacy of Carotid Ultrasound for Predicting the Risk of Perioperative Hypotension or Fluid Responsiveness: A Meta-Analysis.
37443683|a|Despite the acceptance of carotid ultrasound for predicting patients' fluid responsiveness in critical care and anesthesia, its efficacy for predicting hypotension and fluid responsiveness remains unclear in the perioperative setting. Electronic databases were searched from inception to May 2023 to identify observational studies focusing on the use of corrected blood flow time (FTc) and respirophasic variation in carotid artery blood flow peak velocity (DeltaVpeak) for assessing the risks of hypotension and fluid responsiveness. Using FTc as a predictive tool (four studies), the analysis yielded a pooled sensitivity of 0.82 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.72 to 0.89) and specificity of 0.94 (95% CI: 0.88 to 0.97) for the risk of hypotension (area under curve (AUC): 0.95). For fluid responsiveness, the sensitivity and specificity of FTc were 0.79 (95% CI: 0.72 to 0.84) and 0.81 (95% CI: 0.75 to 0.86), respectively (AUC: 0.87). In contrast, the use of DeltaVpeak to predict the risk of fluid responsiveness showed a pooled sensitivity of 0.76 (95% CI: 0.63 to 0.85) and specificity of 0.74 (95% CI: 0.66 to 0.8) (AUC: 0.79). The current meta-analysis provides robust evidence supporting the high diagnostic accuracy of FTc in predicting perioperative hypotension and fluid responsiveness, which requires further studies for verification.
