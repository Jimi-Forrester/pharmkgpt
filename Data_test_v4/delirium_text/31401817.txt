Methionine synthase (encoded by MTR) is a key enzyme participating in this pathway. This study aimed to investigate the relationship of the MTR 2756A > G polymorphism with idiopathic male fertility in the Iranian population. METHODS: The participants of this study included 100 men with idiopathic infertility and 100 healthy men as the control group. Genotyping of MTR 2756A > G was performed using the polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism technique. The obtained data were analyzed using SPSS ver. 20.0 with a level of confidence of p< 0.05. RESULTS: The frequencies of the A and G alleles at this locus were 77% and 23% in infertile patients and 84% and 16% in the control group, respectively. The frequencies of the GG, GA, and AA genotypes were 5%, 36%, and 59% in the infertile patients versus 3%, 27%, and 70% in the control group, respectively. No significant difference was observed in any genetic models. CONCLUSION: In general, the findings of this study suggest that the MTR 2756A > G single-nucleotide polymorphism is not a predisposing factor for idiopathic infertility in men.
