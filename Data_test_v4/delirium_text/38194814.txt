38194814|t|Micromotor-based electrochemical immunoassays for reliable determination of amyloid-beta (1-42) in Alzheimer's diagnosed clinical samples.
38194814|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD), in addition to being the most common cause of dementia, is very difficult to diagnose, with the 42-amino acid form of Abeta (Abeta-42) being one of the main biomarkers used for this purpose. Despite the enormous efforts made in recent years, the technologies available to determine Abeta-42 in human samples require sophisticated instrumentation, present high complexity, are sample and time-consuming, and are costly, highlighting the urgent need not only to develop new tools to overcome these limitations but to provide an early detection and treatment window for AD, which is a top-challenge. In recent years, micromotor (MM) technology has proven to add a new dimension to clinical biosensing, enabling ultrasensitive detections in short times and microscale environments. To this end, here an electrochemical immunoassay based on polypyrrole (PPy)/nickel (Ni)/platinum nanoparticles (PtNPs) MM is proposed in a pioneering manner for the determination of Abeta-42 in left prefrontal cortex brain tissue, cerebrospinal fluid, and plasma samples from patients with AD. MM combines the high binding capacity of their immunorecognition external layer with self-propulsion through the catalytic generation of oxygen bubbles in the internal layer due to decomposition of hydrogen peroxide as fuel, allowing rapid bio-detection (15 min) of Abeta-42 with excellent selectivity and sensitivity (LOD = 0.06 ng/mL). The application of this disruptive technology to the analysis of just 25 muL of the three types of clinical samples provides values concordant with the clinical values reported, thus confirming the potential of the MM approach to assist in the reliable, simple, fast, and affordable diagnosis of AD by determining Abeta-42.
