38358235|t|Application of Noise Control Combined with Relaxation Training in Patients with Skin Laser Cosmetology: A Single-center Retrospective Study.
38358235|a|Objective: Noise pollution has been listed as one of the three major types of pollution, along with air and water pollution. Hospitals should pay attention to noise control, which is of great importance for the treatment and rehabilitation of patients. This study focuses on the application value of noise control and relaxation training. Methods: This study retrospectively collected and analyzed the clinical data of 184 patients who underwent skin laser cosmetology in Ningbo Yinzhou No. 2 Hospital from January 2021 to December 2022. Twelve patients who did not meet the criteria were excluded, and the remaining 172 patients were divided based on the type of intervention into the control group (CG, n = 82) and the study group (SG, n = 90). The CG received relaxation training and routine noise management, while the SG received noise control combined with relaxation training. The intervention effect was discussed from the aspects of noise, psychology, and satisfaction. Results: After the intervention, the SG had overtly lower noise levels and lower scores of anxiety and depression compared to the CG (all P < 0.001). Correlation analysis showed that noise levels were positively correlated with scores of anxiety and depression (r = 0.553, r = 0.592, P < 0.001). The two groups had no significant difference in total satisfaction (P > 0.05). Conclusion: Noise poses a significant threat to the human body. Strengthening noise control in hospitals is beneficial for patients' recovery. Combining noise control with relaxation training is an intervention method worthy of clinical application. It can improve the hospitalization environment and reduce the noise levels to a great extent, thereby improving the psychological state of patients and enhancing the medical satisfaction.
