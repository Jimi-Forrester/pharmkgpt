28126004|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer disease (AD) research has focussed mainly on the amyloid beta protein (Abeta). However, many Abeta-and P3-type peptides derived from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and peptides thought to derive from Abeta catabolism share sequence homology. Additionally, conformations can change dependent on aggregation state and solubility leading to significant uncertainty relating to interpretations of immunoreactivity with antibodies raised against Abeta. We review evidence relating to the reactivities of commonly used antibodies including 6F3D, 6E10 and 4G8 and evaluate their reactivity profiles with respect to AD diagnosis and research. RESULTS: Antibody cross-reactivities between Abeta-type, P3-type and Abeta-catabolic peptides confound interpretations of immunoreactivity. More than one antibody is required to adequately characterise Abeta. The relationships between anti-Abeta immunoreactivity, neuropathology and proposed APP cleavages are unclear. CONCLUSIONS: We find that the concept of Abeta lacks clarity as a specific entity. Anti-Abeta antibody cross-reactivities lead to significant uncertainty in our understanding of the APP proteolytic system and its role in AD with profound implications for current research and therapeutic strategies.
