36768440|t|Neurons, Nose, and Neurodegenerative Diseases: Olfactory Function and Cognitive Impairment.
36768440|a|Olfactory capacity declines with aging, but increasing evidence shows that smell dysfunction is one of the early signs of prodromal neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. The study of olfactory ability and its role in neurodegenerative diseases arouses much interest in the scientific community. In neurology, olfactory impairment is a potential early marker for the onset of neurodegenerative diseases, but the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. The loss of smell is considered a clinical sign of early-stage disease and a marker of the disease's progression and cognitive impairment. Highlighting the importance of biological bases of smell and molecular pathways could be fundamental to improve neuroprotective and therapeutic strategies. We focused on the review articles and meta-analyses on olfactory and cognitive impairment. We depicted the neurobiology of olfaction and the most common olfactory tests in neurodegenerative diseases. In addition, we underlined the close relationship between the olfactory and cognitive deficit due to nasal neuroepithelium, which is a direct extension of the CNS in communication with the external environment. Neurons, Nose, and Neurodegenerative diseases highlights the role of olfactory dysfunction as a clinical marker for early stages of neurodegenerative diseases when it is associated with molecular, clinical, and neuropathological correlations.
