30532357|t|Evaluating the Effect of Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation in Cerebral Palsy Children by Employing Electroencephalogram Signals.
30532357|a|INTRODUCTION: Transcranial magnetic stimulation is a new tool that has been employed to modulate the neuronal activity of brain by its excitatory and inhibitory property. In cerebral palsy (CP) learning of any new task is an extremely slow process due to damage in sensory and motor areas of brain affecting the cognitive ability of the child and putting constraints in achieving timely developmental milestones. For such patients the electroencephalogram (EEG) is one of the most cost effective diagnostic tools used that minimizes hospital stay. Its analysis helps to identify various neurological disorders determining the role of brain waves outlining the present status of mind. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study evaluated the EEG power spectrum density (PSD) of CP children both pre and post rTMS intervention to identify significance changes in signal patterns arising from different brain regions. thirty CP children participated in this study. Fifteen individuals underwent repetitive TMS (rTMS) therapy for 20 session comprising of 10 Hz frequency for 5 days a week for 4 weeks and another fifteen individual participated in activities of daily living for 20 sessions where they were administered mandatory standard therapy only. pre- EEG versus post EEG data recorded and analyzed employing the standard montage configuration. PSD was extracted employing fast fourier transform post acquisition of artifact free signal to undermine changes in signal pattern. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The results revealed that rTMS improves learning ability in CP children and it shows higher power peak at frequency of 50 Hz and lower power peak frequency at 100 Hz. The power intensity in gamma wave region shows significant reduction post-rTMS therapy between 38-24 power peak frequency and 7-4 range in 100 Hz power peak frequency. In future, it will be used as effective tool as memory enhancers, especially for children with neurological disorders.
