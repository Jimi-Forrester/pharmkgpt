31356838|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease causing dementia in the elderly population. Due to the fact that there is still no cure for Alzheimer's dementia and available treatment strategies bring only symptomatic benefits, there is a pressing demand for other effective strategies such as diet. Since the inflammation hypothesis gained considerable significance in the AD pathogenesis, elucidating the modulatory role of dietary factors on inflammation may help to prevent, delay the onset and slow the progression of AD. Current evidence clearly shows that synergistic action of combined supplementation and complex dietary patterns provides stronger benefits than any single component considered separately. Recent studies reveal the growing importance of novel factors such as dietary advanced glycation end products (d-AGE), gut microbiota, butyrate and vitamin D3 on inflammatory processes in AD. CONCLUSION: This paper summarizes the available evidence of pro- and anti-inflammatory activity of some dietary components including fatty acids, vitamins, flavonoids, polyphenols, probiotics and d-AGE, and their potential for AD prevention and treatment.
