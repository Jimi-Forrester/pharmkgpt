19911689|t|[A systematic approach to delirium].
19911689|a|Episodes of delirium are present in a significant number of hospitalised patients. Prevention is essential, because, when established, delirium has a negative impact on clinical outcomes (morbidity and mortality). Identifying at risk patients, monitoring predisposing and precipitating factors and intervening in a timely manner are all essential. In certain populations, such as elderly patients undergoing surgery, a specialized geriatrics consultation reduces the incidence of delirium. Pharmacological treatment is associated with adverse effects and should therefore be reserved for situations leading to impending danger to the patient or others. If such a treatment is indicated, the literature suggests that haloperidol is the antipsychotic of choice.
