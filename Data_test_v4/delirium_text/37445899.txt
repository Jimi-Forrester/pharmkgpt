37445899|a|Biallelic pathogenic variants in subunits of succinyl-CoA synthetase (SCS), a tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle enzyme, are associated with mitochondrial encephalomyopathy in humans. SCS catalyzes the interconversion of succinyl-CoA to succinate, coupled to substrate-level phosphorylation of either ADP or GDP, within the TCA cycle. SCS-deficient encephalomyopathy typically presents in infancy and early childhood, with many patients succumbing to the disease during childhood. Common symptoms include abnormal brain MRI, basal ganglia lesions and cerebral atrophy, severe hypotonia, dystonia, progressive psychomotor regression, and growth deficits. Although subunits of SCS were first identified as causal genes for progressive metabolic encephalomyopathy in the early 2000s, recent investigations are now beginning to unravel the pathomechanisms underlying this metabolic disorder. This article reviews the current understanding of SCS function within and outside the TCA cycle as it relates to the complex and multifactorial mechanisms underlying SCS-related mitochondrial encephalomyopathy.
