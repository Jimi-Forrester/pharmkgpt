24975188|t|Use and safety of conducted electronic devices: what is known?
24975188|a|Conductive electronic devices (CED), such as Taser and stun guns, are sold worldwide for use by security services, although they have also been used for self-defence and even for torture. CED are promoted as non-lethal weapons which can potentially save lives. However, there are multiple reports of deaths temporally associated with CED use. These weapons have definite physiological effects in normal volunteers, especially when accompanied by exertion. Medical examiners often report that deaths followed physical encounters which included the use of CED were due to natural causes, excited delirium and/or drug intoxication. These cases present complex situations in which multiple factors potentially contribute to the death, including electric shocks which cause neuromuscular incapacitation, severe pain and anxiety. Public health officials, physicians and hospital personnel need to be aware that individuals controlled with CED are at increased risk of death. We need better recording of incidents worldwide to understand the extent and outcomes of CED use.
