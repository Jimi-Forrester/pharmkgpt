28706728|a|Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can generate brain images that show neuronal activity due to sensory, cognitive or motor tasks. Haemodynamic response function (HRF) may be considered as a biomarker to discriminate the Alzheimer disease (AD) from healthy ageing. As blood-oxygenation-level-dependent fMRI signal is much weak and noisy, particularly for the elderly subjects, a robust method is necessary for HRF estimation to efficiently differentiate the AD. After applying minimum description length wavelet as an extra denoising step, deconvolution algorithm is here employed for HRF estimation, substituting the averaging method used in the previous works. The HRF amplitude peaks are compared for three groups HRF of young, non-demented and demented elderly groups for both vision and motor regions. Prior works often reported significant differences in the HRF peak amplitude between the young and the elderly. The authors' experimentations show that the HRF peaks are not significantly different comparing the young adults with the elderly (either demented or non-demented). It is here demonstrated that the contradictory findings of the previous studies on the HRF peaks for the elderly compared with the young are originated from the noise contribution in fMRI data.
