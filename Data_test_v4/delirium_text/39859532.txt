39859532|t|Genome-Wide Characterization of Extrachromosomal Circular DNA in the Midgut of BmCPV-Infected Silkworms and Its Potential Role in Antiviral Responses.
39859532|a|Extrachromosomal circular DNAs (eccDNAs) has been found to be widespread and functional in various organisms. However, comparative analyses of pre- and post-infection of virus are rarely known. Herein, we investigated the changes in expression patterns of eccDNA following infection with Bombyx mori cytoplasmic polyhedrosis virus (BmCPV) and explore the role of eccDNA in viral infection. Circle-seq was used to analyze eccDNAs in the midgut of BmCPV-infected and BmCPV-uninfected silkworms. A total of 5508 eccDNAs were identified, with sizes varying from 72 bp to 17 kb. Most of eccDNAs are between 100 to 1000 bp in size. EccDNA abundance in BmCPV-infected silkworms was significantly higher than in BmCPV-uninfected silkworms. GO and KEGG analysis of genes carried by eccDNAs reveals that most are involved in microtubule motor activity, phosphatidic acid binding, cAMP signaling pathway, and pancreatic secretion signaling pathways. Several eccDNAs contain sequences of the transcription factor SOX6, sem-2, sp8b, or Foxa2. Association analysis of eccDNA-mRNA/miRNA/circRNA revealed that some highly expressed genes are transcribed from relevant sequences of eccDNA and the transcription of protein coding genes influenced the frequency of eccDNA. BmCPV infection resulted in changes in the expression levels of six miRNAs, but no known miRNAs with altered expression levels due to changes in eccDNA abundance were identified. Moreover, it was found that 1287 and 924 sequences representing back-spliced junctions of circRNAs were shared by the junctions of eccDNAs in the BmCPV-infected and uninfected silkworms, respectively, and some eccDNAs loci were shared by circRNAs on Chromosomes 2, 7, 11, 14, and 24, suggesting some eccDNAs may exert its function by being transcribed into circRNAs. These findings suggest that BmCPV infection alter the expression pattern of eccDNAs, leading to changes in RNA transcription levels, which may play roles in regulating BmCPV replication. In the future, further experiments are needed to verify the association between eccDNA-mRNA/miRNA/circRNA and its function in BmCPV infection.
