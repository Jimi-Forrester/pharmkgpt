37497005|t|IGF/IGF-1R signal pathway in pain: a promising therapeutic target.
37497005|a|Pain, one of the most important problems in the field of medicine and public health, has great research significance. Opioids are still the main drugs to relieve pain now. However, its application is limited due to its obvious side effects. Therefore, it is urgent to develop new drugs to relieve pain. Multiple studies have found that IGF/IGF-1R pathway plays an important role in the occurrence and development of pain. The regulation of IGF/IGF-1R pathway has obvious effect on pain. This review summarized and discussed the therapeutic potential of IGF/IGF-1R signal pathway for pain. It also summarized that IGF/IGF-1R regulates pain by acting on neuronal excitability, neuroinflammation, glial cells, apoptosis, etc. However, its mechanisms of occurrence and development in pain still need further study in the future. In conclusion, although more deep researches are needed, these studies indicate that IGF/IGF-1R signal pathway is a promising therapeutic target for pain.
