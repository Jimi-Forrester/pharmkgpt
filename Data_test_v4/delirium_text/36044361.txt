36044361|t|Length of Alcohol Abstinence Predicts Posttransplant Delirium in Living Donor Liver Transplant Recipients with Alcoholic Cirrhosis.
36044361|a|OBJECTIVES: History of alcohol abuse is a predictive factor for posttransplant delirium. We aimed to investigate whether preoperative abstinence was associated with posttransplant delirium in liver transplant recipients with alcohol-related cirrhosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From January 2014 to December 2019, 84 patients with alcohol-related cirrhosis who received living donor liver transplant were retrospectively reviewed and divided into a delirium group (n = 46, 54.8%) and a nondelirium group (n = 38, 45.2%) using the Richmond Agitation- Sedation Scale and the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit. RESULTS: In the delirium group versus the nondelirium group, patients were more likely to have preoperative hepatic encephalopathy (58.7% vs 31.6%; P = .013), more likely to have higher Model for End-Stage Liver Disease scores (27.05 +- 10.56 vs 18.85 +- 7.96; P < .001), less likely to have preoperative alcohol abstinence (43.5% vs 68.4%%; P = .022), had longer duration of mechanical ventilation (7.57 +- 7.82 vs 2.50 +- 5.96 days; P = .001), and had longer stays in the intensive care unit (14.85 +- 15.01 vs 8.84 +- 7.84 days; P = .021) and in the hospital (37.89 +- 18.85 vs 27.15 +- 10.43 days; P = .002). Multivariate analysis revealed that preoperative alcohol abstinence (odds ratio 4.953; 95% CI, 1.519-16.152; P = .008) was a significant predictor and that more patients had abstinence durations <3 months (60.9% vs 34.2%; P = .048) in the delirium group. CONCLUSIONS: A high incidence of posttransplant delirium in liver transplant recipients with alcohol- related cirrhosis was associated with preoperative abstinence. Abstinence >6 months before living donor liver transplant is suggested to reduce the risk of posttransplant delirium.
