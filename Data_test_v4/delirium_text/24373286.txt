24373286|t|A function for EHD family proteins in unidirectional retrograde dendritic transport of BACE1 and Alzheimer's disease Abeta production.
24373286|a|Abnormal accumulation of beta-secretase (BACE1) in dystrophic neurites and presynaptic beta-amyloid (Abeta) production contribute to Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. Little, however, is known about BACE1 sorting and dynamic transport in neurons. We investigated BACE1 trafficking in hippocampal neurons using live-cell imaging and selective labeling. We report that transport vesicles containing internalized BACE1 in dendrites undergo exclusive retrograde transport toward the soma, whereas they undergo bidirectional transport in axons. Unidirectional dendritic transport requires Eps15-homology-domain-containing (EHD) 1 and 3 protein function. Furthermore, loss of EHD function compromises dynamic axonal transport and overall BACE1 levels in axons. EHD1/3 colocalize with BACE1 and APP beta-C-terminal fragments in hippocampal mossy fiber terminals, and their depletion in neurons significantly attenuates Abeta levels. These results demonstrate unidirectional endocytic transport of a dendritic cargo and reveal a role for EHD proteins in neuronal BACE1 transcytosis and Abeta production, processes that are highly relevant for Alzheimer's disease.
