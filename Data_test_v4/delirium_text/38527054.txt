38527054|a|Acidosis is one of the hallmarks of demyelinating central nervous system (CNS) lesions in multiple sclerosis (MS). The response to acidic pH is primarily mediated by a family of G protein-coupled proton-sensing receptors: OGR1, GPR4 and TDAG8. These receptors are inactive at alkaline pH, reaching maximal activation at acidic pH. Genome-wide association studies have identified a locus within the TDAG8 gene associated with several autoimmune diseases, including MS. Accordingly, we here found that expression of TDAG8, as opposed to GPR4 or OGR1, is upregulated in MS plaques. This led us to investigate the expression of TDAG8 in oligodendrocytes using mouse and human in vitro and in vivo models. We observed significant upregulation of TDAG8 in human MO3.13 oligodendrocytes during maturation and in response to acidic conditions. However, its deficiency did not impact normal myelination in the mouse CNS, and its expression remained unaltered under demyelinating conditions in mouse organotypic cerebellar slices. Notably, our data revealed no expression of TDAG8 in primary mouse oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), in contrast to its expression in primary human OPCs. Our investigations have revealed substantial species differences in the expression of proton-sensing receptors in oligodendrocytes, highlighting the limitations of the employed experimental models in fully elucidating the role of TDAG8 in myelination and oligodendrocyte biology. Consequently, the study does not furnish robust evidence for the role of TDAG8 in such processes. Nonetheless, our findings tentatively point towards a potential association between TDAG8 and myelination processes in humans, hinting at a potential link between TDAG8 and the pathophysiology of MS and warrants further research.
