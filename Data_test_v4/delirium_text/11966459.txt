11966459|t|Cholinergic agonists and the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
11966459|a|Over the past decade, considerable effort was focused on the development of muscarinic and nicotinic agonists for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. The rationale for developing muscarinic agonists was based on the role of acetylcholine in learning and memory function and the consistent neurochemical finding that cholinergic neurons degenerated in Alzheimer's patients. Thus far, the clinical utility of muscarinic agonists remains unproven, yet recent studies suggest that muscarinic agonists might be useful in treating not only memory deficits, but also psychiatric disturbances and some of the underlying causes of Alzheimer's disease, such as the deposition of Abeta. In addition, nicotinic receptors may play a role in cognitive function and help regulate the toxicity of amyloid precursor protein. Ultimately, cholinergic agonists may prove useful in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
