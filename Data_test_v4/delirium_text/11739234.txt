11739234|t|[Gly(14)]-Humanin improved the learning and memory impairment induced by scopolamine in vivo.
11739234|a|Humanin is a very recently discovered 24 amino acid linear polypeptide, which protects against cell death induced by either familial Alzheimer's disease mutant of amyloid precursor protein, presenilin-1 or presenilin-2 in vitro. However, it has remained uncertain whether humanin is a useful drug for the animal model of learning and memory deficit. In this study, we evaluated the effects of [Gly(14)]-humanin, a more potent humanin analogue, on the scopolamine HBr (1 mg kg(-1) s.c.)-induced impairment of spontaneous alternation behaviour in the Y-maze, an index of short-term memory in mice. [Gly(14)]-Humanin (1000 pmol 5 microl(-1) i.c.v.) reversed the impairment without affecting the number of arm entries. These results suggest that (I) [Gly(14)]-humanin is a beneficial drug for the impairment of learning and memory and (II) it modulates the learning and memory function mediated via cholinergic systems in mice.
