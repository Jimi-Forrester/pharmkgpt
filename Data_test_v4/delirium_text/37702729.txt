37702729|t|Effect of Enhanced Recovery After Surgery on the Prognosis of Patients With Hip Fractures: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
37702729|a|BACKGROUND: Hip fractures, predominantly occurring in the elderly, are a significant public health concern due to associated morbidity, disability, and mortality. Prolonged bed rest following the fracture often leads to complications, further threatening patient health. Enhanced recovery after surgery, a modern approach to postoperative care, is being explored for its potential to improve outcomes and quality of life in hip fracture patients. OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the impact of enhanced recovery after surgery on hip fracture patients. METHODS: In this systematic review, we addressed the PICO question: Does the enhanced recovery after surgery program reduce 1-year mortality, readmissions, and postoperative pain and improve Harris Hip Score compared with traditional care in elderly hip fracture patients? We searched key databases and gray literature and analyzed outcomes through a meta-analysis using RevMan, Stata, and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for quality assessment. RESULTS: Nine studies involving 10,359 patients were included. Compared with the control group, the enhanced recovery after surgery group showed significant reduction in length of stay (mean difference [MD] = -2.00; 95% confidence interval [CI] [-2.87, -1.14]; p < .0001) and overall complication rate (risk ratio [RR] = 0.76; 95% CI [0.67, 0.85]; p < .0001), with a lower delirium rate (RR = 0.42; 95% CI [0.26, 0.68]; p = .004). No significant differences were observed in Harris Hip Score, pain score, 1-year mortality, readmission rate, or incidences of urinary tract infection, respiratory tract infection, and deep vein thrombosis. CONCLUSION: Enhanced recovery after surgery is associated with reduced length of stay, complication rate, and delirium rate in hip fracture patients.
