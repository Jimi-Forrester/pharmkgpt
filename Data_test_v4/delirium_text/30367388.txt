30367388|t|Practice Patterns and Treatment Challenges in Acute Postoperative Pain Management: A Survey of Practicing Physicians.
30367388|a|INTRODUCTION: The management of acute postoperative pain remains a significant challenge for physicians. Poorly controlled postoperative pain is associated with poorer overall outcomes. METHODS: Between April and May 2017, physicians from an online database who regularly prescribe intravenous (IV) medications for acute postoperative pain completed a 47-question survey on topics such as patient demographics, IV analgesia preferences, factors that influence prescribing decisions, and the challenges and unmet needs for the treatment of acute postoperative pain. RESULTS: Of 501 surveyed physicians, 55% practiced in community hospitals, 60% had been in practice for > 10 years, and 60% were surgeons. The three categories of IV pain medications most likely to be prescribed to patients with moderate-to-severe pain immediately after surgery were morphine, hydromorphone, or fentanyl (95.8% of respondents); COX-2 inhibitors or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (73.7%); and acetaminophen (60.5%). Past clinical experience (81.6%), surgery type (78.2%), and onset of analgesia (67.1%) were practice-related factors that most determined their medication choice. Key patient-related risk factors, such as avoidance of medication-related adverse events (AEs), each influenced prescription decisions in > 75.0% of physicians. Nausea and vomiting were among the most common challenges associated with postoperative pain management (76.2 and 60.3%, respectively), and avoidance of analgesic medication-related AEs was among the three most influential patient-related factors that determined prescribing decision (75%). Physicians reported the top unmet need for acute pain management in patients experiencing moderate-to-severe postoperative pain was more medications with fewer side effects (i.e., nausea, vomiting, and respiratory depression; 80.7%). CONCLUSIONS: Opioids remain an integral component of multimodal acute analgesic therapy for acute postoperative pain in hospitalized patients. The use of all IV analgesic medications is limited by concerns over AEs, particularly with opioids and in high-risk patients. There remains a key unmet need for effective analgesic medications that are associated with a lower risk of AEs. FUNDING: Trevena, Inc.
