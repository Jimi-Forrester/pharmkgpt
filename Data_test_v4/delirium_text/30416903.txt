30416903|t|Normal Correction of Sodium Leading to Central Pontine Demyelinosis: A Rare Occurrence.
30416903|a|Central pontine myelinolysis is a rare condition arising from the myelinolysis of white matter tracts in the pons, most commonly in response to iatrogenic hypertonic stress caused by the rapid correction of hyponatremia. Here, we present an interesting case of central pontine myelinolysis subsequent to normal saline infusion despite strict adherence to the guideline protocol.
