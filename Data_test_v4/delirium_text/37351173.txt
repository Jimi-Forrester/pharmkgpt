37351173|a|Purpose: Chondrocytes (CHs) in cartilage undergo several detrimental events during the development of osteoarthritis (OA). However, the mechanism underlying CHs regeneration involved in pathogenesis is largely unknown. The aim of this study was to explore the underlying mechanism of regeneration of CHs involved in the pathological condition and the potential therapeutic strategies of cartilage repair. Methods and Materials: CHs were isolated from human cartilage in different OA stages and the high-resolution cellular architecture of human osteoarthritis was examined by applying single-cell RNA sequencing. The analysis of gene differential expression and gene set enrichment was utilized to reveal the relationship of cartilage regeneration and microtubule stabilization. Microtubule destabilizer (nocodazole) and microtubule stabilizer (docetaxel) treated-human primary CHs and rats cartilage defect model were used to investing the effects and downstream signaling pathway of microtubule stabilization on cartilage regeneration. Results: CHs subpopulations were identified on the basis of their gene markers and the data indicated an imbalance caused by an increase in the degeneration and disruption of CHs regeneration in OA samples. Interestingly, the CHs subpopulation namely CHI3L1+ CHs, was characterized by the cell regenerative capacity, stem cell potency and the activated microtubule (MT) process. Furthermore, the data indicated that MT stabilization was effective in promoting cartilage regeneration in rats with cartilage injury model by inhibiting YAP activity. Conclusion: These findings lead to a new understanding of CHs regeneration in the OA pathophysiology context and suggest that MT stabilization is a promising therapeutic target for OA and cartilage injury.
