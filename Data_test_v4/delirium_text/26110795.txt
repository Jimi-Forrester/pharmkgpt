26110795|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review examines the current literature on tau imaging in atypical parkinsonian disorders and other tauopathies. RECENT FINDINGS: There are a number of tau PET radiotracers that have demonstrated promising preliminary results in atypical parkinsonian disorders, such as progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal degeneration. These radiotracers were capable of selectively labeling tau in vitro and in vivo, with high affinity. Other radiotracers tested more extensively in patients with Alzheimer's disease have also been able to successfully image tau deposition. SUMMARY: The development of tau radioligands for PET has led to the current testing of these tracers in clinical studies, many of which concentrate on patients with Alzheimer's disease. Atypical parkinsonian disorders such as progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal degeneration are now being investigated as well. These disorders can be very difficult to diagnose, because of their clinical overlap with other parkinsonian disorders. Imaging tau using PET could serve as a diagnostic biomarker for these tauopathies and provide a means of assessing treatment that targets tau burden.
