37042462|a|INTRODUCTION: There is an urgent need for novel blood biomarkers for the detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We previously showed that levels of the bisecting N-acetylglucosamine glycan epitope was elevated in cerebrospinal fluid in AD. However, its diagnostic value in blood is unknown. METHODS: We analyzed blood levels of bisecting N-acetylglucosamine and total tau in a retrospective cohort of 233 individuals. Progression to AD was compared between the groups using Cox regression. The predictive value of the biomarkers was determined by logistic regression. RESULTS: Bisecting N-acetylglucosamine correlated with tau levels (p < 0.0001). Individuals with an intermediate tau/bisecting N-acetylglucosamine ratio had elevated AD risk (hazard ratio = 2.06, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.18-3.6). Moreover, a combined model including tau/bisecting N-acetylglucosamine ratio, apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon4 status, and Mini-Mental State Examination score predicted future AD (area under the curve = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.68-0.93). DISCUSSION: Bisecting N-acetylglucosamine in combination with tau is a valuable blood biomarker for predicting AD.
