34540390|t|Palliative Care and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Readmissions: A Narrative Review.
34540390|a|Despite all the advances in the treatment and management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), COPD readmissions remain a major challenge nationwide. Increasing evidence suggests that palliative care involvement with a holistic approach towards end-of-life care can significantly improve outcomes related to the quality of life and survival for late-stage cancers and chronic progressive illnesses like COPD, chronic heart failure, and end-stage renal disease. Some studies have attempted to evaluate an association between the involvement of palliative care and readmission reduction, the effect of which remains elusive, especially with regards to COPD readmissions. This review examined the existing literature to analyze the relationship between palliative care involvement for COPD patients and its effect on COPD readmissions.
