37989804|t|A common pathway for detergent-assisted oligomerization of Abeta42.
37989804|a|Amyloid beta (Abeta) aggregation is a slow process without seeding or assisted nucleation. Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) micelles stabilize Abeta42 small oligomers (in the dimer to tetramer range); subsequent SDS removal leads to a 150-kD Abeta42 oligomer. Dodecylphosphorylcholine (DPC) micelles also stabilize an Abeta42 tetramer. Here we investigate the detergent-assisted oligomerization pathway by solid-state NMR spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations. SDS- and DPC-induced oligomers have the same structure, implying a common oligomerization pathway. An antiparallel beta-sheet formed by the C-terminal region, the only stable structure in SDS and DPC micelles, is directly incorporated into the 150-kD oligomer. Three Gly residues (at positions 33, 37, and 38) create holes that are filled by the SDS and DPC hydrocarbon tails, thereby turning a potentially destabilizing feature into a stabilizing factor. These observations have implications for endogenous Abeta aggregation at cellular interfaces.
