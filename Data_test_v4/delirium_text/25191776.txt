25191776|t|Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors-induced delirium: a case review.
25191776|a|BACKGROUND: Many commonly used medications are associated with causing delirium, especially those with notable direct effects on the brain. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are probably the most often prescribed antidepressants and are known for their favourable side-effect profile. METHODS: Medline and Toxline databases were searched for case reports of delirium caused by SSRIs. Twelve cases were reviewed in addition to our case of escitalopram-induced delirium in old age. RESULTS: Only five cases of delirium due to SSRIs as the main or most probable etiologic factor were published in the last two decades. In two cases SSRI seems a possible additional cause of delirium in combination with other psychotropic medication. CONCLUSIONS: Although SSRIs are considered safe, they can still cause delirium in an ageing patient even when SSRI was previously used without considerable side effects.
