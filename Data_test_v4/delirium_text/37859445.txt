37859445|a|Objective: : Irisin is a myokine that is involved in neurogenesis, neuronal proliferation, and neuronal differentiation. Many research examine the relationship between irisin and schizophrenia. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the relationship between irisin levels and cognitive functions in individuals with schizophrenia. Methods: : Ninety-six individuals who were diagnosed with schizophrenia were included. The Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) was used to assess disease severity. To evaluate the cognitive functions of the patients, the trail-making test was evaluated with the A and B forms and the verbal memory processes scale. After a 12-hour night fast, samples of fasting blood were obtained from the participants. Results: : There was no significant correlation between irisin, duration of disease, and BPRS total score. In the analysis performed, a positive correlation was found between the plasma irisin level and the error score of the trail-making test form B. Other than that, no correlation was found between irisin level and cognitive performance in schizophrenia patients. In addition, in subgroup analysis between genders, it was determined that the duration of the trail-making test B was longer in female schizophrenia patients. Conclusion: : In this study, there was a positive correlation between the trail-making test B-form error scores and the irisin levels. This relationship between impaired executive functions and irisin levels may suggest that the irisin level is increased as compensation for the impairment in executive functions. More research is needed to understand the role of irisin in cognitive impairment and schizophrenia.
