34867501|a|Introduction: Catatonia, characterized by motor, behavioral and affective abnormalities, frequently co-occurs with delirium during critical illness. Advanced age is a known risk factor for development of delirium. However, the association between age and catatonia has not been described. We aim to describe the occurrence of catatonia, delirium, and coma by age group in a critically ill, adult population. Design: Convenience cohort, nested within two clinical trials and two observational cohort studies. Setting: Intensive care units in an academic medical center in Nashville, TN. Patients: 378 critically ill adult patients on mechanical ventilation and/or vasopressors. Measurements and Main Results: Patients were assessed for catatonia, delirium, and coma by independent and blinded personnel, the Bush Francis Catatonia Rating Scale, the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and the Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale. Of 378 patients, 23% met diagnostic criteria for catatonia, 66% experienced delirium, and 52% experienced coma during the period of observation. There was no relationship found between age and catatonia severity or age and presence of specific catatonia items. The prevalence of catatonia was strongly associated with age in the setting of critical illness (p < 0.05). Delirium and comas' association with age was limited to the setting of catatonia. Conclusion: Given the significant relationship between age and catatonia independent of coma and delirium status, these data demonstrate catatonia's association with advanced age in the setting of critical illness. Future studies can explore the causative factors for this association and further elucidate the risk factors for acute brain dysfunction across the age spectrum.
