35499740|t|First-Trimester Impetigo Herpetiformis Leads to Stillbirth: A Case Report.
35499740|a|INTRODUCTION: Pustular psoriasis of pregnancy (PPP), also known as impetigo herpetiformis (IH), is a rare variant of generalized pustular psoriasis (GPP) in pregnancy. It typically occurs in the third trimester and is a life-threatening condition for both the pregnant mother and the fetus if not diagnosed and treated promptly. Drug-induced PPP has been reported in sporadic case reports. Here we present a case of first-trimester PPP occurring after applying drugs including chloroquine, which we consider a possible culprit triggering the disease. CASE REPORT: A 29-year-old female was admitted to our department at 45 days gestation with sudden onset of fever and widespread erythematous pustules for 9 days. She had been on medications including hydroxychloroquine before onset. The eruptions and systemic symptoms were controlled with high-dose systemic steroids; however, she was detected to have a stillbirth, and underwent dilation and curettage of the uterine. At the latest follow-up about 2 years after her admission, she reported to have delivered a healthy baby about 1 month previously. CONCLUSIONS: Chloroquine has potential to lead to PPP in the first trimester of pregnancy. Further studies are warranted to investigate the etiology and treatment of PPP to facilitate early recognition and optimal management of this relatively rare dermatosis in pregnancy.
