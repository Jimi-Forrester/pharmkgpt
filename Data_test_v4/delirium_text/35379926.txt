35379926|a|Background Denture loss is a significant problem for patients admitted to hospital in the UK. Initiatives aimed at staff and patients have been introduced at many hospitals to try and reduce and solve this issue.Aim This investigation aimed to evaluate the impact of a quality improvement programme on denture loss at an acute hospital, including the reasons dentures were reported as lost or broken and who reported them.Method Information on dentures which were lost or broken was collected in an acute hospital between 2016-2021 and included the number of losses, the reason for the loss/breakage and who reported them. The number of complaints and financial reimbursement related to denture loss was also obtained from the trust for the same period.Results In total, 123 dentures were reported as lost or broken between 2016-2021. The most commonly reported reasons for loss were patient transfers between wards, being left on hospital trays, or when patients were sleeping. Patients or carers are more likely to report a lost denture compared to hospital staff. Reimbursement paid by the trust for denture incidents is much lower than the numbers reported.Conclusion Creating a single reporting pathway for denture loss and implementing methods to reduce denture loss led to an increase in the numbers of dentures reported as lost. This is likely to be attributed to an increased awareness of reporting pathways. Denture loss is a significant financial burden to the NHS, in addition to causing patients and families distress and is most likely under-reported in many hospitals.
