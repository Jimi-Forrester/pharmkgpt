36459957|t|Cognitive recovery trajectories 3 months following stroke in Mexican American and non-Hispanic white adults.
36459957|a|OBJECTIVES: We examined whether cognitive trajectories from 0-3 months after stroke differ between Mexican Americans (MAs) and non-Hispanic white (NHW) adults. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The sample included 701 participants with ischemic stroke (62% MA; 38% NHW) from the population-based stroke surveillance study, the Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi (BASIC) Project, between 2008-2013. The outcome was the modified Mini Mental State Examination (3MSE, range 0-100 lower scores worse). Linear mixed effects models were utilized to examine the association between ethnicity and cognitive trajectories from 0-3 months following stroke, adjusting for confounders. RESULTS: MAs were younger, had lower educational attainment, and fewer had health insurance than NHWs (all p< 0.01). A smaller proportion of MAs were rated by informants as exhibiting pre-stroke cognitive decline than NHW (p < .0.05). After accounting for confounders, MAs demonstrated lower cognitive performance at post-stroke baseline and at 3-months following stroke (-2.00; 95% CI =-3.92, -0.07). Cognitive trajectories from 0-3 months following stroke were indicative of modest cognitive recovery (increase of 0.034/day, 95% CI =0.030-0.036) and did not differ between MAs and NHWs (p = 0.68). CONCLUSION: We found no evidence that cognitive trajectories in the first three months following stroke differed between MAs and NHWs. MAs demonstrated lower cognitive performance shortly after stroke and at three months following stroke compared to NHWs. Further research is needed to identify factors contributing to ethnic disparities in cognitive outcomes after stroke.
