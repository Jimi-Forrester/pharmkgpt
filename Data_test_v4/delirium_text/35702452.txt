35702452|a|The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that there are around 1.7 million beds in certified nursing homes across the United States and approximately 1.3 million residents in long-term and end-of-life care. There could be several factors causing a delayed recovery in such patients, such as decreased ambulation, multiple comorbidities, and polypharmacy. An 83-year-old Caucasian woman sustained a fall resulting in compression fractures of the thoracic and lumbar spine. She had multiple comorbidities, including anemia of chronic disease, malnutrition, and a significant weight loss of 30 lbs over the four months prior to hospitalization. She was on antihypertensives, antidepressants, vitamin D, and calcium supplementation. Her medical history was significant for constipation with the passage of stools once in three days. Her family history was significant for colorectal cancer (CRC) and her screening colonoscopy three years ago was normal. Physical examination revealed no abdominal tenderness or distention. Subsequently, she developed edema in the left lower extremity. She underwent a venous Doppler/ultrasound study, which showed an occlusive thrombus from the common femoral vein to the popliteal vein. She was started on anticoagulants and supportive therapy. Four months later, while at the nursing home, she developed bloating and flatulence, in addition to pre-existing constipation. Examination revealed a 6 x 7 cm mass in the right lower quadrant without peritoneal signs. Bowel sounds were significantly decreased. CT imaging showed a 6-cm diameter cecal mass. The tumor was a low-grade 4 x 9 cm T4N0M0 cecal cancer, and she underwent placement of a Greenfield filter and subsequent hemicolectomy. She had methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection and right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), urinary tract infection, Clostridium difficile colitis, and depression, all managed successfully and without sequelae in the post-operative period. Treatment on discharge comprised Coumadin maintenance for nine months with an international normalized ratio goal of 2-3, a back brace, antidepressants, and antihypertensive medications. She received follow-up care at home. Maintaining a high degree of suspicion for new and persistent symptoms in the elderly is essential to identify the underlying cause. One of the leading causes of post-colonoscopy CRC is a missed lesion. Careful attention to all cases of anemia as well as DVT in the elderly is also imperative to diagnose such missed cases. Future research should focus on the methods of CRC diagnosis in elderly patients with comorbidities apart from using colonoscopy alone.
