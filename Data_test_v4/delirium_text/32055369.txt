32055369|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most prevailing neurodegenerative illnesses in the elderly. Accumulation of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) and inflammation play critical roles in the pathogenesis and development of AD. Multi-target drugs may interdict the progress of AD through a synergistic mechanism. A neuromodulator, 2-((1H-benzo[d]imidazole-2-yl)methoxy)benzoic acid (BIBA), consisting of an Abeta-targeting group and a derivative of anti-inflammatory aspirin was designed as a potential anti-AD agent. BIBA exhibits a remarkable inhibitory effect on the self- and metal-induced Abeta aggregations and shows outstanding anti-inflammatory activity simultaneously. The neurotoxicity of Abeta aggregates is attenuated, and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (PICs), such as IL-6, IL-1beta and TNF-alpha, in microglia stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or Abeta is reduced. Owing to the synergy between the inhibition of Abeta oligomerization and downregulation of PICs, BIBA markedly prolongs the lifespan and relieves the Abeta-induced paralysis of Abeta-transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans, thus showing the potential to ameliorate the symptoms of AD through inhibiting Abeta neurotoxicity and deactivating microglia. These findings demonstrate that both Abeta aggregation and neuroinflammation are therapeutic targets for anti-AD drugs, and dual-functional agents that integrate anti-Abeta and anti-inflammatory capabilities have great advantages over the traditional single-target agents for AD treatment.
