28707657|a|Deposits of amyloid peptide Abeta and intracellular aggregates of hyperphosphorylated tau protein in the brain of patients are major neuropathological features of Alzheimer's disease (AD). For a long time, the possibility of horizontal transmission of Abeta aggregates from cell to cell and from person to person remained hypothetical, since there was no experimental evidence. However, in 1993, the formation of senile plaques was confirmed in the brains of animals after intracerebral injections of AD patient brain homogenates or homogenates of the brain of transgenic mice enriched with Abeta aggregates. Other experiments indicate that amyloid peptide Abeta and intracellular aggregates of hyperphosphorylated tau protein may be transferred from cell to cell like prions. In 2015 and 2016, it was reported that AD could be transmitted to humans during medical procedures, i.e., that this disease might be iatrogenic. This review discusses the mechanisms by which pathogenic Abeta protein can be transmitted between cells and analyzes the current evidence concerning the possibility of horizontal Abeta transmission from person to person.
