38977221|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGY RELEVANCE: Ganoderma leucocontextum T.H. Li, W. Q. Deng M. Wang & H.P.Hu. is a highland herbal medicine that has been shown to nourish the nervesand prolong life. Nevertheless, there is no evidence to indicate that Ganoderma leucocontextum triterpenoids (GLTs) reduce the damage triggered by Alzheimer's disease (AD). AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of this investigation was to ascertain the protective effects of GLTs on AD mice models and cells, as well as to look into potential pathways. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, the phytochemical characterization of GLTs was performed by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) and Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The AD mouse model was induced by injecting intraperitoneally with D-galactose (120 mg/kg) and administering orally with aluminum chloride (20 mg/kg) daily for 28 days. After that, donepezil (5 mg/kg) and GLTs (0.4, 0.8, and 1.6 g/kg) were administered orally for 35 days. During the treatment period, aluminum chloride (20 mg/kg) and D-galactose (120 mg/kg) were continuously administered. And the behavior of the animals and the molecular changes of the hippocampus were determined after the whole experimental procedure. Furthermore, BV-2 cells were employed to validate GLTs' anti-neuroinflammatory properties. RESULTS: The total triterpenoids content was 443.12 +- 0.21 g/kg and was inferred to contain 19 classes of substances such as organic acids, amino acids, vitamins, flavonoids, and other chemicals in GLTs. Treatment of D-galactose/aluminum chloride-induced mouse with GLTs can ameliorate AD symptoms, counteract cognitive decline, improve Abeta1-42 deposition, reduce the expression level of pro-apoptotic proteins, and attenuate the activation of hippocampal microglia and astrocytes. GLTs significantly increased the expression of antioxidant enzymes and significantly reduced the expression of inflammatory factors. GLTs inhibits nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) nuclear translocation and preserves myd88/traf6-mediated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation. Furthermore, GLTs (2 and 5 mg/mL) inhibited the generation of nitric oxide and protected lipopolysaccharide (1 mg/L)-induced neuroinflammation in BV-2 cells. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, Ganoderma leucocontextum triterpenoids can improve cognitive functions, including learning and memory, by reducing neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, preventing apoptosis, and controlling amyloid genesis.
