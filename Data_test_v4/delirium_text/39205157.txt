39205157|t|Neurological Complications of COVID-19: Unraveling the Pathophysiological Underpinnings and Therapeutic Implications.
39205157|a|Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), induced a global pandemic with a diverse array of clinical manifestations. While the acute phase of the pandemic may be waning, the intricacies of COVID-19's impact on neurological health remain a crucial area of investigation. Early recognition of the spectrum of COVID-19 symptoms, ranging from mild fever and cough to life-threatening respiratory distress and multi-organ failure, underscored the significance of neurological complications, including anosmia, seizures, stroke, disorientation, encephalopathy, and paralysis. Notably, patients requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission due to neurological challenges or due to them exhibiting neurological abnormalities in the ICU have shown increased mortality rates. COVID-19 can lead to a range of neurological complications such as anosmia, stroke, paralysis, cranial nerve deficits, encephalopathy, delirium, meningitis, seizures, etc., in affected patients. This review elucidates the burgeoning landscape of neurological sequelae associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and explores the underlying neurobiological mechanisms driving these diverse manifestations. A meticulous examination of potential neuroinvasion routes by SARS-CoV-2 underscores the intricate interplay between the virus and the nervous system. Moreover, we dissect the diverse neurological manifestations emphasizing the necessity of a multifaceted approach to understanding the disease's neurological footprint. In addition to elucidating the pathophysiological underpinnings, this review surveys current therapeutic modalities and delineates prospective avenues for neuro-COVID research. By integrating epidemiological, clinical, and diagnostic parameters, we endeavor to foster a comprehensive analysis of the nexus between COVID-19 and neurological health, thereby laying the groundwork for targeted therapeutic interventions and long-term management strategies.
