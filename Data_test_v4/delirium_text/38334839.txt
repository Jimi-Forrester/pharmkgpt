38334839|a|BACKGROUND: Widespread attention has been given to the detrimental effects of obesity on cognitive function. However, there is no evidence on the connection between low cognitive performance and the WWI (weight-adjusted waist index). This study looked into the connection between poor cognitive performance and the WWI in senior Americans. METHODS: A cross-sectional research study was carried out with information from the NHANES 2011-2014. With multivariate linear regression models, the pertinence between the WWI and low cognitive function in persons older than 60 years was examined. The nonlinear link was described using threshold effect analyses and fitted smoothed curves. Interaction tests and subgroup analysis were also conducted. RESULTS: The study had 2762 individuals in all, and subjects with higher WWI values were at greater risk for low cognitive function. In the completely adjusted model, the WWI was positively connected with low cognitive performance assessed by CERAD W-L (OR = 1.22, 95% CI 1.03-1.45, p = 0.0239), AFT (OR = 1.30, 95% CI 1.09-1.54, p = 0.0029), and DSST (OR = 1.59, 95% CI 1.30-1.94, p < 0.0001). The effect of each subgroup on the positive correlation between the WWI and low cognitive performance was not significant. The WWI and low cognitive performance as determined by CERAD W-L and AFT had a nonlinear connection (log-likelihood ratio < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Among older adults in the United States, the risk of low cognitive performance may be positively related to the WWI.
