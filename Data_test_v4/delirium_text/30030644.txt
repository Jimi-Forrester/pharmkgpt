30030644|t|Data Mining Algorithms and Techniques in Mental Health: A Systematic Review.
30030644|a|Data Mining in medicine is an emerging field of great importance to provide a prognosis and deeper understanding of disease classification, specifically in Mental Health areas. The main objective of this paper is to present a review of the existing research works in the literature, referring to the techniques and algorithms of Data Mining in Mental Health, specifically in the most prevalent diseases such as: Dementia, Alzheimer, Schizophrenia and Depression. Academic databases that were used to perform the searches are Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore, PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus and Web of Science, taking into account as date of publication the last 10 years, from 2008 to the present. Several search criteria were established such as 'techniques' AND 'Data Mining' AND 'Mental Health', 'algorithms' AND 'Data Mining' AND 'dementia' AND 'schizophrenia' AND 'depression', etc. selecting the papers of greatest interest. A total of 211 articles were found related to techniques and algorithms of Data Mining applied to the main Mental Health diseases. 72 articles have been identified as relevant works of which 32% are Alzheimer's, 22% dementia, 24% depression, 14% schizophrenia and 8% bipolar disorders. Many of the papers show the prediction of risk factors in these diseases. From the review of the research articles analyzed, it can be said that use of Data Mining techniques applied to diseases such as dementia, schizophrenia, depression, etc. can be of great help to the clinical decision, diagnosis prediction and improve the patient's quality of life.
