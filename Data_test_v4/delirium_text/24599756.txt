24599756|a|Retention of intracellular secreted APP (isAPP) can be provoked by the neurotoxic peptide Abeta. The latter decreases in the cerebrospinal fluid of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, as a consequence of its cerebral accumulation and deposition into senile plaques. Of similar relevance, secreted APP (sAPP) levels can be associated with AD. The studies here presented, reinforce the link between sAPP and Abeta and address putative therapeutic strategies. Laminin and gelsolin are potential candidates; both prevent Abeta fibril formation by complexing with Abeta, thus attenuating its neurotoxicity. We show that preincubation of Abeta with laminin and gelsolin has the effect of rendering it less potent to isAPP accumulation in cortical neurons. This appears to be related to a decrease in F-actin polymerization, whereas Abeta alone induces the polymerization. Further, Abeta decreases gelsolin levels, and the latter is involved in Abeta removal. Our data indicates that Abeta-laminin and Abeta-gelsolin complexes are less neurotoxic and also less potent than fibrillar Abeta at inducing isAPP retention. These results validate the potential of these proteins as therapeutic strategies that prevent the Abeta-induced effects. In hence, given that Abeta decreases the levels of proteins involved in its own clearance, this may contribute to the mechanisms underlying AD pathology.
