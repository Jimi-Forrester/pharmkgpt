38222245|a|Dementia is a debilitating neurological condition that is characterized by persistent cognitive decline. It is a global health challenge, with a rapidly increasing prevalence due to an increasing aging population. Although definitive diagnosis of various conditions of dementia is only possible by autopsy, clinical diagnosis can be performed by a specialist. The diagnostic process has evolved with recent breakthroughs in diagnostic tools, such as advanced imaging techniques and biomarkers. These tools facilitate early and accurate identification of the condition. Early diagnosis is vital, as it enables timely interventions to improve the quality of life for affected individuals. Treatment strategies for dementia encompass both pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches. Non-pharmacological treatments include cognitive training and lifestyle modifications. Among pharmacological treatments, acetyl-cholinesterase inhibitors including donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine can be used in various doses based on the severity of the disease. Apart from these, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists such as memantine can also be used. Furthermore, personalized treatments have also gained significant attention in dementia treatment. Interdisciplinary care, involving healthcare professionals, social workers, and support networks, is crucial for comprehensive and holistic dementia management.
