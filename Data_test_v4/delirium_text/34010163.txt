34010163|t|Reliability of Patient-Report, Physician-Report, and Medical Record Review to Identify Hospital-Acquired Complications: A Prospective Cohort Study.
34010163|a|This prospective study of internal medicine inpatients treated at 2 hospitals in Toronto, Canada, between September 1, 2016, and September 1, 2017, compared patient-report, physician-report, and detailed medical record review to identify specific hospital-acquired complications. Six complications were assessed: delirium, catheter-associated urinary tract infection, acute kidney injury, deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism, hospital-acquired pneumonia, or fall. The study included 207 patients and physician responses were obtained for 156 (75%). Complications were identified in 28 (14%) patients by medical record review, 30 (14%) patients by patient-report, and 11 (7%) patients by physician-report. Fifty-four (26%) patients experienced a complication as identified through at least one of the 3 methods. There was little agreement between the 3 methods (Fleiss' k 0.15, P < 0.001). All 3 sources agreed on the occurrence of a specific complication in only 1 patient (1%). Multiple approaches likely are needed to adequately measure hospital-acquired complications.
