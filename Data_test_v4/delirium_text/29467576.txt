29467576|t|Mitochondrial genome variability: the effect on cellular functional activity.
29467576|a|Mitochondria are the key players in cell metabolism, calcium homeostasis, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Mitochondrial genome alterations are reported to be associated with numerous human disorders affecting nearly all tissues. In this review, we discuss the available information on the involvement of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations in cell dysfunction.
