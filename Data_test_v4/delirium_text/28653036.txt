28653036|a|INTRODUCTION: The diagnostic utility of in vivo amyloid beta (Abeta) imaging to aid in the clinical distinction between frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and Alzheimer's disease remains unclear without data on the prevalence and severity of Abeta in pathologically confirmed FTD syndromes. METHODS: Abeta was assessed in 98 autopsy-confirmed FTD and 36 control cases, and the pathological accuracy of 11C-Pittsburgh compound B (PiB)-positron emission tomography imaging was assessed in a subset of FTD cases (n = 15). RESULTS: Abeta was identified in a similar proportion of FTD syndromes and age-matched controls and increases with age. Alzheimer's disease pathology was identified in all cases with high PiB retention and in one case with low PiB retention. We further demonstrate a strong regional correlation between volume fraction of histological Abeta with PiB standard uptake value ratio scaled to the white matter. DISCUSSION: The present study provides a pathologic reference to assist in the interpretation of in vivo assessments in FTD syndromes.
