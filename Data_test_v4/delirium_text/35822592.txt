35822592|a|Various studies suggested that neuroinflammation leads to the development of several neurodegenerative disorders like Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Huntington's disease (HD). Rotenone is an organic pesticide and potent inhibitor of complex I of electron transport chain widely used to develop the PD model. Numerous studies reported rotenone toxicity in the dopaminergic system but very few studies are available on rotenone-induced glial cell activation and subsequent neurodegeneration and alterations in various types of behavior. Therefore, the present study was designed to explore the effect of rotenone on neuroinflammation and its deleterious effect on the behavior of mice, and also how these effects can be protected through quercetin. Quercetin, a natural flavonoid having strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, is found in vegetables and fruits. The finding of the study indicated that rotenone 5 mg/kg body weight for 60 days through oral gavage leads to the release of inflammatory markers in blood serum, astrocytes activation in substantia nigra and hippocampus, and subsequently decreased density of dopaminergic fibers in the striatum. Rotenone also altered the memory of the mice as indicated by decreased spontaneous alteration in Y-maze and T-maze tests and reduction in exploration time in novel object recognition, increased immobility time in the forced swim test and reduced muscular strength. Co-treatment of quercetin 30 mg/kg/day through oral gavage for 60 days along with rotenone significantly reversed all these adverse effects, suggesting that quercetin could reduce neuroinflammation, and improve memory, and cognitive function.
