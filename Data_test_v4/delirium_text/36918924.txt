36918924|t|Capnographic monitoring reduces hypoxia incidence in older patients undergoing gastrointestinal endoscopy under propofol sedation: study protocol for a multicenter randomized controlled trial.
36918924|a|BACKGROUND: Hypoxia is a very common adverse event that occurs during gastrointestinal endoscopy under sedation, especially in older patients, owing to limited reservation of heart, brain, lung, and other organs. Prolonged or severe hypoxia can cause ischemia of the coronary artery and permanent nervous system damage, and even result in death. Hence, it is imperative to reduce or prevent hypoxia during gastrointestinal endoscopy under sedation in older patients. Although several oxygen delivery methods would reduce hypoxia during this procedure, early detection of respiratory depression and early administration of intervention would be the best method to reduce or even confirm the hypoxia. Capnographic monitoring is reportedly more sensitive for detecting respiratory depression before the onset of hypoxia than the current clinical routine monitoring of pulse oxygen saturation; however, its effect is controversial. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to improve the safety of gastrointestinal endoscopy under sedation in older patients. METHODS: A multicenter, randomized, single-blind, two-arm parallel-group, controlled with an active comparator, interventional superiority clinical trial will be conducted to evaluate the impact of an additional capnographic monitoring-based intervention on the incidence of hypoxia in older patients. Patients (n = 1800) scheduled for gastrointestinal endoscopy with propofol sedation will be randomly assigned to either a control or interventional arm, wherein standard or capnographic monitoring is implemented, respectively. DISCUSSION: This study primarily aims to examine whether an additional capnographic monitoring-based intervention can reduce the incidence of hypoxia in older patients during gastrointestinal endoscopy under propofol and sufentanil sedation. The results of this study may extensively impact gastrointestinal endoscopy under sedation and the development of associated guidelines. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05030870.
