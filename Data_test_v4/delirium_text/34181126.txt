34181126|t|Effect of Exoskeleton-Assisted Rehabilitation Over Prefrontal Cortex in Multiple Sclerosis Patients: A Neuroimaging Pilot Study.
34181126|a|Application of a passive and fully articulated exoskeleton, called Human Body Posturizer (HBP), has been demonstrated to improve mobility, response accuracy and ambulation in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. By using functional magnetic imaging (fMRI) during a visuomotor discrimination task, we performed a pilot study to evaluate the effect of HBP over the neural correlates of motor and cognitive functions which are typically impaired in MS patients. Specifically, we tested the effect of a 6-week multidisciplinary rehabilitation intervention on two groups of MS patients: a control group who followed a standard physiotherapeutic rehabilitation protocol, and an experimental group who used the HBP during physical exercises in addition to the standard protocol. We found that, after treatment, the experimental group exhibited a significant lower activity (as compared to the control group) in the inferior frontal gyrus. This post-treatment activity reduction can be explained as a retour to a normal range, being the amount of iFg activity observed in the experimental patients very similar to that observed in healthy subjects. These findings indicate that the use of HBP during rehabilitation intervention normalizes the prefrontal activity, mitigating the cortical hyperactivity associated to MS.
