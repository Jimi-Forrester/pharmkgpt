34723963|t|A behavioral screen for mediators of age-dependent TDP-43 neurodegeneration identifies SF2/SRSF1 among a group of potent suppressors in both neurons and glia.
34723963|a|Cytoplasmic aggregation of Tar-DNA/RNA binding protein 43 (TDP-43) occurs in 97 percent of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), ~40% of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and in many cases of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Cytoplasmic TDP-43 inclusions are seen in both sporadic and familial forms of these disorders, including those cases that are caused by repeat expansion mutations in the C9orf72 gene. To identify downstream mediators of TDP-43 toxicity, we expressed human TDP-43 in a subset of Drosophila motor neurons. Such expression causes age-dependent deficits in negative geotaxis behavior. Using this behavioral readout of locomotion, we conducted an shRNA suppressor screen and identified 32 transcripts whose knockdown was sufficient to ameliorate the neurological phenotype. The majority of these suppressors also substantially suppressed the negative effects on lifespan seen with glial TDP-43 expression. In addition to identification of a number of genes whose roles in neurodegeneration were not previously known, our screen also yielded genes involved in chromatin regulation and nuclear/import export- pathways that were previously identified in the context of cell based or neurodevelopmental suppressor screens. A notable example is SF2, a conserved orthologue of mammalian SRSF1, an RNA binding protein with roles in splicing and nuclear export. Our identification SF2/SRSF1 as a potent suppressor of both neuronal and glial TDP-43 toxicity also provides a convergence with C9orf72 expansion repeat mediated neurodegeneration, where this gene also acts as a downstream mediator.
