35454879|a|About 4 million children with an oncological disease worldwide require pediatric palliative care (PPC) due to the nature of their condition. PPC is not limited to end-of-life care; it is a general approach continuing over the entire disease trajectory, regardless of whether the patient receives any oncological treatment. This review addresses the value of integrating PPC in treating children with cancer, focusing on the basic principles of PPC and its application in pediatric oncology. Moreover, models for PPC implementation in oncology, end-of-life care, and advanced care planning are discussed.
