31289051|t|Cohort Profile: National health insurance service-senior (NHIS-senior) cohort in Korea.
31289051|a|PURPOSE: The National Health Insurance Service (NHIS)-Senior was set up to provide high-quality longitudinal data that can be used to explore various aspects of changes in the socio-economical and health status of older adults, to predict risk factors and to investigate their health outcomes. PARTICIPANTS: The NHIS-Senior cohort, a Korean nationwide retrospective administrative data cohort, is composed of older adults aged 60 years and over in 2002. It consists of 558 147 people selected by 10% simple random sampling method from a total of 5.5 million subjects aged 60+ in the National Health Information Database. The cohort was followed up through 2015 for all subjects, except for those who were deceased. FINDINGS TO DATE: The healthcare utilisation and admission rates were the highest for acute upper respiratory infections and influenza (75.2%). The age-standardised (defined with reference to the world standard population) mortality rate for 10 years (through 2012) was 4333 per 100 000 person-years. Malignant neoplasms were the most common cause of death in both sexes (1032.1 per 100 000 person-years for men, 376.7 per 100 000 person-years for women). A total of 34 483 individuals applied for long-term care service in 2008, of whom 17.9% were assessed as grade 1, meaning that they were completely dependent on the help of another person to live daily life. FUTURE PLANS: The data are provided for the purposes of policy and academic research under the Act on Promotion of the Provision and Use of Public Data in Korea. The NHIS-Senior cohort data are only available for Korean researchers at the moment, but it is possible for researchers outside the country to gain access to the data by conducting a joint study with a Korean researcher. The cohort will be maintained and continuously updated by the NHIS.
