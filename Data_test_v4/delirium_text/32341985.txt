32341985|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) impairs memory and learning related behavioural performances of the affected person. Compared with the controls, memory and learning related behavioural performances of the AD model rats followed by hippocampal proteomics had been observed in the present study. In the eight armed radial maze, altered performance of the AD rats had been observed. Using liquid chromatography coupled tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), 822 proteins had been identified with protein threshold at 95.0%, minimum peptide of 2 and peptide threshold at 0.1% FDR. Among them, 329 proteins were differentially expressed with statistical significance (P < 0.05). Among the significantly regulated (P < 0.05) 329 proteins, 289 met the criteria of fold change (LogFC of 1.5) cut off value. Number of proteins linked with AD, oxidative stress (OS) and hypercholesterolemia was 59, 20 and 12, respectively. Number of commonly expressed proteins was 361. The highest amount of proteins differentially expressed in the AD rats were those involved in metabolic processes followed by those linked with OS. Most notable was the perturbed state of the cholesterol metabolizing proteins in the AD group. Current findings suggest that proteins associated with oxidative stress, glucose and cholesterol metabolism and cellular stress response are among the mostly affected proteins in AD subjects. Thus, novel therapeutic approaches targeting these proteins could be strategized to withstand the ever increasing global AD burden.
