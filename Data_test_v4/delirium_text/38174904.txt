38174904|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) measures neurochemicals in vivo. Glutathione (GSH) is a neuroprotective chemical shown to vary significantly in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). This work investigates the reproducibility of GSH measures in the mesial temporal lobe (MTL) to identify its potential clinical utility. METHODS: MRS data were acquired from eight healthy volunteers (31.1 +- 5.2 years; 4 male/female) using Mescher-Garwood-Point Resolved Spectroscopy (MEGA-PRESS) from the MTL in the left hemisphere across two scan sessions in the same visit. Total N-acetylaspartate (tNAA), choline (tCho), creatine (tCr), and GSH were quantified. Reproducibility of quantifications of these neurochemicals were tested using coefficient of variance (CV) between scan sessions. Reproducibility of voxel placement on the left MTL was calculated by measuring the tissue overlap and percent of hippocampus within that voxel. CV measured across different scan sessions in each individual, with a CV<15% was accepted as "good" reproducibility. Paired t-tests were carried out to establish the significant differences between the two scans across each individual with p<.05 as significant. RESULTS: TNAA (%CV = 7.2; p = .5), tCr (%CV = 7.8; p = .6) and tCho (%CV = 9.3; p = .4), and GSH (%CV = 22; p = .1). The dice coefficient that reflects the level of overlap of hippocampal tissue in the voxel was shown to be 0.8 +- 0.1. Voxel tissue composition were: Scan 1 (cerebrospinal fluid [CSF]: 5 +- 1%, white matter [WM]: 52 +- 3%, gray matter [GM]: 43 +- 3%); Scan 2 (CSF: 5 +- 1%, WM: 52 +- 4%, GM: 44 +- 4%). CONCLUSION: The data suggest measures of abundant metabolites in the MTL using the MEGA-PRESS sequence has a high reproducibility. Reproducibility of GSH in this area was poorer requiring care when interpreting measures of GSH in the MTL for clinical translational purposes.
