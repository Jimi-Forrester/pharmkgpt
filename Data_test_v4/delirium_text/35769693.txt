35769693|a|Background: The optimal treatment strategy for postoperative pain following pancreatoduodenectomy remains unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate whether sublingual sufentanil tablet (SST) is a non-inferior analgesic compared to our standard-of-care (patient-controlled epidural analgesia [PCEA] or PCA morphine) in the treatment of pain following pancreatoduodenectomy. Methods: This was a pragmatic, strategy, open-label, non-inferiority, parallel group, randomized (1:1) trial. The primary outcome was an overall mean pain score (Numerical Rating Scale: 0-10) on postoperative days 1 to 3 combined. The non-inferiority margin was -1.5 since this difference was considered clinically relevant. Results: Between October 2018 and July 2021, 190 patients were assessed for eligibility and 36 patients were included in the final analysis: 17 patients were randomized to SST and 19 patients to standard-of-care. Early treatment failure in the SST group occurred in 2 patients (12%) due to inability to operate the SST system and in 2 patients (12%) due to severe nausea despite antiemetics. Early treatment failure in the standard-of-care group occurred in 2 patients (11%) due to preoperative PCEA placement failure and in 1 patient (5%) due to hemodynamic instability caused by PCEA. The mean difference in pain score on postoperative day 1 to 3 was -0.10 (95% CI -0.72-0.52), and therefore the non-inferiority of SST compared to standard-of-care was demonstrated. The mean pain score, number of patients reporting unacceptable pain (pain score >4), Overall Benefit of Analgesia Score, and patient satisfaction per postoperative day, perioperative hemodynamics and postoperative outcomes did not differ significantly between groups. Conclusion: This first randomized study investigating the use of SST in 36 patients following pancreatoduodenectomy showed that SST is non-inferior compared to our standard-of-care in the treatment of pain on postoperative days 1 to 3. Future research is needed to confirm that these findings are applicable to other settings.
