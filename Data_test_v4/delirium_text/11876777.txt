11876777|a|To determine whether altered cholinergic neurotransmission can modify the long-term secretion of amyloid precursor protein (APP), endogenous levels of APP and nerve growth factor (NGF), we administered a selective M1 muscarinic receptor agonist (RS86) or the muscarinic antagonist, atropine, for 7 days in vivo into young adult mice (C57BL/6j). The levels of NGF and total APP in the hippocampus, frontal cortex, striatum, parietal cortex and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were examined by ELISA and Western blot. We found that this repeated i.m. administration of M1 receptor agonist resulted in decreased total APP levels in the hippocampus, frontal cortex and parietal cortex, and increased secreted alpha-APPs levels in the CSF. M1 agonist treatment also resulted in decreased NGF levels in the hippocampus and CSF. These effects of the M1 muscarinic agonist could be blocked by atropine, which by itself elevated tissue levels of total APP. Interestingly, we found that the decrease of total APP in the hippocampus and striatum after M1 agonist treatment inversely correlated with the change in NGF levels. These data suggest that a sustained increased cholinergic, M1-mediated neurotransmission will enhance secretion of alpha-APPs in CSF and adaptively reduce the levels of total APP and NGF in the corticohippocampal regions of normal mice. The dynamic and adaptive regulation linking total APP and NGF levels in normal adult mice is relevant for understanding the pathophysiology of conditions with cholinergic and APP related pathologies, like Alzheimer's disease and Down's syndrome.
