38312531|t|The Causal Associations between Adipokines and Alzheimer's Disease: A Two-Sample Mendelian Randomization Study.
38312531|a|Background: Observational studies have indicated the association of alteration of adipokines with Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, it remains unclear whether the associations are causal. Objective: To determine the causal associations between adipokines and AD. Methods: A Mendelian randomization (MR) method was applied to investigate the causal relationships of adipokines, including adiponectin and resistin, with risk of AD. Genetic proxies from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of adiponectin and resistin were selected as instrumental variables. GWAS summary statistics for AD were extracted as outcome. Results: In this study, we found evidence of the causal effects of adiponectin on AD (OR: 0.850, 95% CI: 0.731-0.990, p = 0.037). However, no relationship between resistin and AD (OR: 0.936, 95% CI: 0.851-1.029, p = 0.171) was detected. In the reverse causation analysis, null associations of AD were found for adiponectin and resistin (all p > 0.05). Conclusions: This study provides evidence of causality between adiponectin and risk of AD. However, no genetic susceptibility of resistin was discovered for AD.
