32678174|a|Positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) with 18F-fluorodesoxyglucose (FDG) is the imaging modality of choice for assessing inflammation surrounding hepatic alveolar echinococcosis (AE) lesions. This study is the first to evaluate FDG uptake in hepatic AE (n = 51) based on the standardized uptake value (SUV) and to correlate the SUVs with primary morphology and calcification patterns, based on the Echinococcus multilocularis Ulm Classification for Computed-Tomography (EMUC-CT). Our results show that the SUVs were increased for lesions with EMUC-CT types I-IV primary morphology, compared to the surrounding healthy liver tissue (SUV = 2.5 +- 0.4; p < 0.05). Type IV lesions included, by far, the highest number of PET-negative lesions. A comparison of lesions with different primary morphologies showed clear differences. The highest SUVs were found for types I and III, and the lowest was found for type IV. Type IV lesions (SUV, 3.8 +- 1.5) showed significantly lower uptake compared to type I (SUV, 6.9 +- 3.5; p = 0.030) and type III (SUV, 7.4 +- 3.9; p = 0.031) lesions. For type II lesions, the results showed only a statistical trend (SUV, 6.1 +- 3.1; p = 0.073). Due to the small number of cases, an evaluation of type V (n = 1) lesions was not possible. The different SUVs of lesions with different primary morphologies, particularly the lower FDG uptake observed in type IV lesions, suggested that these SUVs might reflect different stages of the disease.
