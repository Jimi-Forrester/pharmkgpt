32629661|a|BACKGROUND: To evaluate the effect of hospice care on the quality of life and negative emotion of advanced tumor patients systematically, which compared with routine nursing mode, improving the quality of life of advanced tumor patients, reducing the negative emotion of advanced tumor patients, and providing evidence-based medicine for better implementation of targeted service of hospice care. METHODS: Computer retrieval network electronic database: Retrieval CNKI, Chinese clinical trial registry, WANFANG database, China Biology Medicine disc, CQVIP database, PubMed, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and Web of Science database on the clinical research of hospice care on the quality of life and negative emotions of advanced tumor patients. While dating from the references included in the study, manually retrieving relevant tabloids, papers, and related journals without electronic version. The retrieval strategy adopts the combination of subject words and free words. The range of searching time was from the beginning of each database to April 1, 2020. According to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the 2 researchers selected the literature and extracted the data independently, and used the Cochrane system evaluator manual 5.1.0 to conduct a bias risk assessment of the literature, which was finally included in the study. If two researchers disagree in the process of literature selection, a third researcher is invited to join in, discuss the issues that have differences, and then make a decision. RevMan 5.3.3 software and Stata 14.0 software were used to conduct the meta-analysis of the included research. RESULTS: According to the process of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P), this study will be carried out strictly, and the results of research will be published publicly in high-quality international academic journals with peer review. CONCLUSION: Through the study, we will arrive at whether hospice care has advantages in improving the quality of life and negative emotion of advanced tumor patients, which compared with routine nursing mode, and the formulation of individualized hospice care strategy to provide the basis for the application of hospice care in the treatment of end stage tumor patients.
