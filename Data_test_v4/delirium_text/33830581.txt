33830581|a|The aberrant thalamocortical pathways of epilepsy have been detected recently, while its underlying effects on epilepsy are still not well understood. Exploring pathoglytic changes in two important thalamocortical pathways, that is, the basal ganglia (BG)-thalamocortical and the cerebellum-thalamocortical pathways, in people with idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE), could deepen our understanding on the pathological mechanism of this disease. These two pathways were reconstructed and investigated in this study by combining diffusion and functional MRI. Both pathways showed connectivity changes with the perception and cognition systems in patients. Consistent functional connectivity (FC) changes were observed mainly in perception regions, revealing the aberrant integration of sensorimotor and visual information in IGE. The pathway-specific FC alterations in high-order regions give neuroimaging evidence of the neural mechanisms of cognitive impairment and epileptic activities in IGE. Abnormal functional and structural integration of cerebellum, basal ganglia and thalamus could result in an imbalance of inhibition and excitability in brain systems of IGE. This study located the regulated cortical regions of BG and cerebellum which been affected in IGE, established possible links between the neuroimaging findings and epileptic symptoms, and enriched the understanding of the regulatory effects of BG and cerebellum on epilepsy.
