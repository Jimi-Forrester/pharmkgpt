36932199|a|Mitochondrial impairment, energetic crisis and elevated oxidative stress have been demonstrated to play a pivotal role in the pathological processes of Huntington's disease (HD). 3-Nitropropionic acid (3-NPA) is a natural neurotoxin that mimics the neurological dysfunctions, mitochondrial impairments and oxidative imbalance of HD. The current investigation was undertaken to demonstrate the neuroprotective effect of 4-(methylthio)butyl isothiocyanate (4-MTBITC) against the 3-NPA induced neurotoxicity in human dopaminergic SH-SY5Y cells. The experimental evidence of oxidative DNA damage by 3-NPA was elucidated by pBR322 DNA nicking assay. In contrast, the 4-MTBITC considerably attenuated the DNA damage, suggesting its free radical scavenging action against 3-NPA and Fenton's reagent. The dose and time-dependent increase of 3-NPA revealed its neurotoxic dose as 0.5 mM after 24 h of treatment of SH-SY5Y cells in MTT assay. In order to determine the optimal dose at which 4-MTBITC protects cell death, the 3-NPA (IC50) induced cells were pretreated with different concentrations of 4-MTBITC for 1 h. The neuroprotective dose of 4-MTBITC against 3-NPA was found to be 0.25 muM. Additionally, the elevated GSH levels in cells treated with 4-MTBITC indicate its propensity to eliminate reactive species generated as a result of 3-NPA-induced mitochondrial dysfunction. Likewise, it was determined through microscopic and flow cytometric experiments that 3-NPA's induced overproduction of reactive species and a decline in mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) could be efficiently prevented by pre-treating cells with 4-MTBITC. To elucidate the underlying molecular mechanism, the RT-qPCR analysis revealed that the pre-treatment of 4-MTBITC effectively protected neuronal cells against 3-NPA-induced cell death by preventing Caspase-3 activation, Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) upregulation, activation of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) and Nrf2 induction. Together, our findings lend credence to the idea that pre-treatment with 4-MTBITC reduced 3-NPA-induced neurotoxicity by lowering redox impairment, apoptotic state, and mitochondrial dysfunction. The present work, in conclusion, presented the first proof that the phytoconstituent 4-MTBITC supports the antioxidant system, BDNF/TrkB/CREB signaling, and neuronal survival in dopaminergic SH-SY5Y cells against 3-NPA-induced oxidative deficits.
