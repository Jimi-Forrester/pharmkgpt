37032769|a|Background: Senescence is characterized by an aggravated inflammatory state that reduces vaccine responsiveness. Dietary supplementation with spray-dried porcine plasma (SDP) exerts anti-inflammatory effects in different mucosal areas. We aimed to determine if the anti-inflammatory properties of SDP improve the efficiency of immunization in senescent animals. Methods: Experiments were performed in 2-month-old and 6-month-old male SAMP8 mice fed control or SDP (8%) feeds for 4  months. The mice received nasal doses of 2.5  mug of Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin B (SEB) or vehicle every 15  days (i.e., 3 times). Fifteen days after the last dose, a lethal shock was induced by intraperitoneal administration of SEB and LPS. Results: Immunization increased anti-SEB IgA in intestinal and bronchoalveolar fluid (p < 0.05). After the lethal shock, all immunized aged mice that were supplemented with SDP survived, in contrast to only 66% of those fed the control feed (p < 0.05). Moreover, after the lethal challenge, aged mice showed higher expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Il-6, Tnf-alpha, Ifn-gamma, and Il-1beta) in jejunal and (Tnf-alpha, and Il-1beta) in lung tissues (p < 0.05), which were reduced by SDP supplementation (p < 0.05). Furthermore, in senescent mice, SDP supplementation augmented Il-4 and Il-10 expression in both tissues (p < 0.05). Conclusion: SDP reduces the mucosal inflammation associated with aging, improving vaccine protection in senescent mice.
