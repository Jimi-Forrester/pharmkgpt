29161719|a|BACKGROUND/AIMS: The generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) caused by amyloid-beta (Abeta) is considered to be one of mechanisms underlying the development of Alzheimer's disease. Curcumin can attenuate Abeta-induced neurotoxicity through ROS scavenging, but the protective effect of intracellular curcumin on neurocyte membranes against extracellular Abeta may be compromised. To address this issue, we synthesized a palmitic acid curcumin ester (P-curcumin) which can be cultivated on the cell membrane and investigated the neuroprotective effect of P-curcumin and its interaction with Abeta. METHODS: P-curcumin was prepared through chemical synthesis. Its structure was determined via nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS). An MTT assay was used to assess Abeta cytotoxicity and the protective effect of P-curcumin on SH-SY5Y cells. The effect of P-curcumin on Abeta-induced ROS production in vitro and in vivo were assessed based on changes in dichlorofluorescein (DCF) fluorescence. A spectrophotometric method was employed to detect lipid peroxidation. To mimic the interaction of P-curcumin on cell membranes with Abeta, liposomes were prepared by thin film method. Finally, the interactions between free P-curcumin and P-curcumin cultivated on liposomes and Abeta were determined via spectrophotometry. RESULTS: A novel derivative, palmitic acid curcumin ester was prepared and characterized. This curcumin, cultivated on the membranes of neurocytes, may prevent Abeta-mediated ROS production and may inhibit the direct interaction between Abeta and the cellular membrane. Furthermore, P-curcumin could scavenge Abeta-mediated ROS as curcumin in vitro and in vivo, and had the potential to prevent lipid peroxidation. Morphological analyses showed that P-curcumin was better than curcumin at protecting cell shape. To examine P-curcumin's ability to attenuate direct interaction between Abeta and cell membranes, the binding affinity of Abeta to curcumin and P-curcumin was determined. The association constants for free P-curcumin and curcumin were 7.66 x 104 M-1 and 7.61 x 105 M-1, respectively. In the liposome-trapped state, the association constants were 3.71 x 105 M-1 for P-curcumin and 1.44x 106 M-1 for curcumin. With this data, the thermodynamic constants of P-curcumin association with soluble Abeta (DeltaH, DeltaS, and DeltaG) were also determined. CONCLUSION: Cultivated curcumin weakened the direct interaction between Abeta and cell membranes and showed greater neuroprotective effects against Abeta insult than free curcumin.
