34631990|a|OBJECTIVES: To explore the acceptability and feasibility of public square dancing among community residents with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and depressive symptoms. METHODS: This mixed-method study consisted of a quantitative and a qualitative phase. From January to July 2018, a total of 241 community-dwelling senior citizens who complained of memory loss in one community in the Haidian District in Beijing were approached and screened, and 41 qualified for the study. Among them, 35 senior citizens participated in the public square dancing intervention. By the end of the three-month follow-up, 31 senior citizens completed the whole study. The Subjective Exercise Experience Scale (SEES) was used to survey senior citizens at the end of the three-month public square dancing intervention and follow-up to measure the participants' subjective exercise experience. Then 15 senior citizens were interviewed to collect attitudes, opinions, and suggestions related to the intervention. RESULTS: During the intervention, 90.6% of senior citizens met the requirement for defined hours. All senior citizens continued to dance at the three-month follow-up, and 32.3% met the requirement for defined hours. The scores of psychological well-being (11.03 +- 2.82 vs. 14.87 +- 3.93, P < 0.001) and fatigue (11.00 [8.00, 12.00] vs. 14.00 [9.00, 18.00], P < 0.001) increased at the end of the three-month follow-up. Qualitative research results extracted four major themes: increased confidence and a sense of accomplishment; easy to learn, close to real life, and sense of belonging; promotes physical and mental health; future expectations include music selection, reduced weather disruption, and self-organizing workouts. CONCLUSION: Public square dancing proved to be an acceptable, viable, and valuable intervention for MCI residents with depressive symptoms, which could be carried out by nursing staff in the community. Future studies should consider the appropriate population, intensity, and frequency of public square dancing and its effect on specific cognitive functions.
