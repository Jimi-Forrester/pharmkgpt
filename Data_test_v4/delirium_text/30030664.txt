30030664|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose was to review the most recent literature on neuroimaging in the Kleine-Levin syndrome (KLS). We aimed to investigate if frontotemporal and thalamic dysfunction are key KLS signatures, and if recent research indicates other brain networks of interest that elucidate KLS symptomatology and aetiology. RECENT FINDINGS: In a comprehensive literature search, we found 12 original articles published 2013-2018. Most studies report deviations related to cerebral perfusion, glucose metabolism, or blood-oxygen-level-dependent responses in frontotemporal areas and/or the thalamus. Studies also report dysfunction in the temporoparietal junction and the oculomotor network that also were related to clinical parameters. We discuss these findings based on recent research on thalamocortical networks and brain stem white matter tracts. The hypothesis of frontotemporal and thalamic involvement in KLS was confirmed, and additional findings in the temporoparietal junction and the oculomotor system suggest a broader network involvement, which can be investigated by future high-resolution and multimodal imaging.
