24099896|t|Palliative sedation in patients with advanced cancer followed at home: a prospective study.
24099896|a|CONTEXT: Home care programs in Italy. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess a protocol for palliative sedation (PS) performed at home. METHODS: A total of 219 patients were prospectively assessed to evaluate a PS protocol in patients with advanced cancer followed at home by two home care programs with different territorial facilities. The protocol was based on stepwise administration of midazolam. RESULTS: A total of 176 of the patients died at home, and PS was performed in 24 of these patients (13.6%). Younger patients received the procedure more frequently than older patients (P=0.012). The principal reasons to start PS were agitated delirium (n=20) and dyspnea (n=4). Mean duration of PS was 42.2+-30.4 hours, and the mean doses of midazolam were 23-58 mg/day. Both the home care team and the patients' relatives expressed optimal or good levels of satisfaction with the procedure in all but one case, respectively. CONCLUSION: This protocol for PS was feasible and effective in minimizing distress for a subgroup of patients who died at home. The characteristics of patients who may be effectively sedated at home should be better explored in future studies.
