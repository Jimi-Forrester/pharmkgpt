However, a variety of diseases related to the nervous system have a serious impact on human health. It is increasingly clear that neurological diseases are multifactorial pathological processes involving multiple cellular systems, and the onset of these diseases usually involves a diverse array of molecular mechanisms. Unfortunately, no effective therapy exists to slow down the progression or prevent the development of diseases only through the regulation of a single factor. To this end, it is pivotal to seek an ideal therapeutic approach for challenging the complicated pathological process to achieve effective treatment. In recent years, fisetin, a kind of flavonoid widely existing in fruits, vegetables and other plants, has shown numerous interesting biological activities with clinical potentials including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and neurotrophic effects. In addition, fisetin has been reported to have diverse pharmacological properties and neuroprotective potentials against various neurological diseases. The neuroprotective effects were ascribed to its unique biological properties and multiple clinical pharmacological activities associated with the treatment of different neurological disorders. In this review, we summarize recent research progress regarding the neuroprotective potential of fisetin and the underlying signaling pathways of the treatment of several neurological diseases.
