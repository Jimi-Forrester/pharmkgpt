31974062|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between impaired arousal on admission and 30-day mortality in acutely ill older adults. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Patients age +65 years admitted to the geriatric ward of a tertiary university hospital from 2010 to 2018 in Sao Paulo, Brazil. METHODS: Participants were evaluated on admission according to a standardized comprehensive geriatric assessment model. Delirium was detected using the short version of the Confusion Assessment Method (Short-CAM). We used 2 alternative criteria to define impaired arousal: lethargy, stupor, or coma according to the Short-CAM; and a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of <=13. Our primary outcome was time-to-death in 30 days, and we used Cox proportional hazards models to explore the association between impaired arousal and decreased survival. RESULTS: We included 1554 admissions with a mean age of 81 years and of whom 61% were women. Overall, prevalent delirium was observed in 28% of the cases. We found that in 33% of admissions, patients were lethargic, stuporous, or comatose, and that in 23%, they had GCS scores of <=13. General 30-day mortality was 19% but reached 32% in patients with GCS scores of <=13. Impaired arousal was independently associated with lower survival in 30 days, both when defined using Short-CAM criteria [lethargy + stupor + coma: hazard ratio (HR) 2.33, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.66-3.27] and GCS scores (GCS 12-13: HR 1.62, 95% CI 1.13-2.33; GCS <= 11: HR 2.53, 95% CI 1.68-3.80). In interaction analyses, we confirmed our results in patients who had impaired arousal but were neither delirious (lethargy + stupor + coma: HR 2.16, 95% CI 1.44-3.24; GCS <= 11: HR 3.07; 95% CI 1.50-6.29) nor demented (lethargy + stupor + coma: HR 1.95, 95% CI 1.15-3.28). CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Level of arousal on admission was an independent predictor of 30-day survival in acutely ill older adults, regardless of delirium or baseline dementia. Clinicians should be aware that even if unsure of whether a patient has delirium, arousal assessment can provide crucial clinical and prognostic insight.
