37221544|t|Brain-lung crosstalk: how should we manage the breathing brain?
37221544|a|Recent studies have drawn increasing attention to brain-lung crosstalk in critically ill patients. However, further research is needed to investigate the pathophysiological interactions between the brain and lungs, establish neuroprotective ventilatory strategies for brain-injured patients, provide guidance on potentially conflicting treatment priorities in patients with concomitant brain and lung injury, and enhance prognostic models to inform extubation and tracheostomy decisions. To bring together such research, BMC Pulmonary Medicine welcomes submissions to its new Collection on 'Brain-lung crosstalk'.
