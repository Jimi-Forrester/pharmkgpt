19337543|t|Role of TGF-beta on cardiac structural and electrical remodeling.
19337543|a|The type beta transforming growth factors (TGF-betas) are involved in a number of human diseases, including heart failure and myocardial arrhythmias. In fact, during the last 20 years numerous studies have demonstrated that TGF-beta affects the architecture of the heart under both normal and pathological conditions. Moreover, TGF-beta signaling is currently under investigation, with the aim of discovering potential therapeutic roles in human disease. In contrast, only few studies have investigated whether TGF-beta affects electrophysiological properties of the heart. This fact is surprising since electrical remodeling represents an important substrate for cardiac disease. This review discusses the potential role of TGF-beta on cardiac excitation-contraction (EC) coupling, action potentials, and ion channels. We also discuss the effects of TGF-beta on cardiac development and disease from structural and electrophysiological points of view.
