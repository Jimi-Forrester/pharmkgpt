29531792|t|DNAJC5 facilitates USP19-dependent unconventional secretion of misfolded cytosolic proteins.
29531792|a|Cell-to-cell transmission of misfolded proteins propagates proteotoxic stress in multicellular organisms when transmitted polypeptides serve as a seeding template to cause protein misfolding in recipient cells, but how misfolded proteins are released from cells to initiate this process is unclear. Misfolding-associated protein secretion (MAPS) is an unconventional protein-disposing mechanism that specifically exports misfolded cytosolic proteins including various neurodegenerative disease-causing proteins. Here we establish the HSC70 co-chaperone DNAJC5 as an essential mediator of MAPS. USP19, a previously uncovered MAPS regulator binds HSC70 and acts upstream of HSC70 and DNAJC5. We further show that as a membrane-associated protein localized preferentially to late endosomes and lysosomes, DNAJC5 can chaperone MAPS client proteins to the cell exterior. Intriguingly, upon secretion, misfolded proteins can be taken up through endocytosis and eventually degraded in the lysosome. Collectively, these findings suggest a transcellular protein quality control regulatory pathway in which a deubiquitinase-chaperone axis forms a "triaging hub", transferring aberrant polypeptides from stressed cells to healthy ones for disposal.
