16860440|t|Longitudinal 1H MRS changes in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease.
16860440|a|Magnetic resonance (MR)-based volume measurements of atrophy are potential markers of disease progression in patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Longitudinal changes in (1)H MR spectroscopy ((1)H MRS) metabolite markers have not been characterized in MCI subjects. Our objective was to determine the longitudinal (1)H MRS metabolite changes in patients with MCI, and AD, and to compare (1)H MRS metabolite ratios and ventricular volumes in tracking clinical disease progression in AD. The neuronal integrity marker N-acetylaspartate/creatine ratio declined in MCI and AD patients compared to cognitively normal elderly. The change in (1)H MRS metabolite ratios correlated with clinical progression about as strongly as the rate of ventricular expansion, suggesting that (1)H MRS metabolite ratios may be useful markers for the progression of AD. Choline/creatine ratio declined in stable MCI, compared to converter MCI patients and cognitively normal elderly, which may be related to a compensatory mechanism in MCI patients who did not to progress to AD.
