36749273|t|A study of the relationship between serum uric acid levels and pain in patients with migraine.
36749273|a|Serum uric acid (SUA), the end product of purine metabolism acts as an antioxidant and is related to oxidative stress. It has been reported that SUA may be involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer disease, Huntington disease, Parkinson disease, and multiple sclerosis. However, studies evaluating SUA levels in migraine are scarce. This study aimed to explore the relationship between pain characteristics and SUA levels in patients with migraine and compare SUA levels in migraine patients during a headache attack and headache-free period with those control groups. This prospective, cross-sectional study included 78 patients with migraine and 78 healthy subjects who were randomly selected from hospital personnel as the control group. Headache characteristics (duration of attack, pain intensity, and headache frequency) and sociodemographic features were recorded. The SUA level was measured once in the control group and twice in the migraine patients, during the migraine attack and headache-free periods. Although the SUA levels of the migraine group in the headache-free period were higher than those of the control group, the difference was not statistically significant. Gender was not significantly related to the change in SUA levels between the attack and headache-free period. When the correlation between age, duration of migraine, frequency, duration, and intensity of pain was evaluated; the difference between SUA levels in female migraine patients was weakly correlated with headache intensity, whereas male patients had a moderate correlation. ( P < .05; R > 0.250, and R > 0.516, respectively). The difference in SUA level in the migraine attack period compared to the headache-free period showing a positive correlation with pain intensity suggested that SUA may have a role in migraine due to its antioxidant role.
