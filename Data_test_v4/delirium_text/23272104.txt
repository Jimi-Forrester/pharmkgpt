23272104|a|Huntingtin Yeast Two-Hybrid Protein K (HYPK) is an intrinsically unstructured huntingtin (HTT)-interacting protein with chaperone-like activity. To obtain more information about the function(s) of the protein, we identified 27 novel interacting partners of HYPK by pull-down assay coupled with mass spectrometry and, further, 9 proteins were identified by co-localization and co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) assays. In neuronal cells, (EEF1A1 and HSPA1A), (HTT and LMNB2) and (TP53 and RELA) were identified in complex with HYPK in different experiments. Various Gene Ontology (GO) terms for biological processes, like protein folding (GO: 0006457), response to unfolded protein (GO: 0006986), cell cycle arrest (GO: 0007050), anti-apoptosis (GO: 0006916) and regulation of transcription (GO: 0006355) were significantly enriched with the HYPK-interacting proteins. Cell growth and the ability to refold heat-denatured reporter luciferase were decreased, but cytotoxicity was increased in neuronal cells where HYPK was knocked-down using HYPK antisense DNA construct. The proportion of cells in different phases of cell cycle was also altered in cells with reduced levels of HYPK. These results show that HYPK is involved in several biological processes, possibly through interaction with its partners.
