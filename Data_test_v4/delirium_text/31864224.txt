31864224|t|Biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease. Where we stand and where we are headed.
31864224|a|Alzheimer disease (AD) is one of the major unresolved health burdens accompanying the increase in life expectancy. The great paradigm shift for this disease has resulted from finding amyloid deposition and neurobrillary degeneration 20 years and 10 years, respectively, prior to onset of the typical clinical memory loss symptoms. The advent of AD biomarkers has enabled a molecular definition of AD, making the clinical definition almost dispensable. Various types of AD biomarkers are available in our country. Each biomarker reflects a particular process and stage of the disease. Although costs restrict their use, the biomarker analysis may be justified in certain clinical scenarios, such as an early onset or an atypical presentation of the disease. Today, the usefulness of biomarkers in AD clinical research is beyond question. Furthermore, the introduction of biomarkers into medical practice has led to significant changes in therapeutic interventions, even in the absence of disease-modifying drugs.
