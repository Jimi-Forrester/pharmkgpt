30390681|a|Oxidative stress (OS) and nitrative stress (NS) accompany many diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Antioxidants have been proposed to counteract OS/NS in these diseases. Nevertheless, the effects of antioxidants are limited and new, more efficient antioxidants are searched for. Redox-active nanoparticles (RNPs), containing antioxidants create a new therapeutical perspective. This review examines the recent literature describing synthesis and potential applications of cerium oxide RNPs, boron cluster-containing and silica containing RNPs, Gd3N@C80 encapsulated RNPs, and concentrates on nitroxide-containing RNPs. Nitroxides are promising antioxidants, preventing inter alia glycation and nitration, but their application poses several problems. It can be expected that application of RNPs containing covalently bound nitroxides, showing low toxicity and able to penetrate the blood-brain barrier will be more efficient in the treatment of neurodegenerative disease, in particular AD and PD basing on their effects in cellular and animal models of neurodegenerative diseases.
