20965178|t|A free radical-generating system regulates APP metabolism/processing.
20965178|a|Oxidative stress, a risk factor in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease, is intimately associated with aging. We previously reported that the X-XOD free radical generating system acts as a modulator of lipid metabolism and a mild inducer of apoptotic death. Using the same cell model, the present study examines the metabolism/processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). Prior to inducing cell death, X-XOD promoted the secretion of alpha-secretase-cleaved soluble APP (sAPPalpha) and increased the level of APP carboxy-terminal fragments produced by alpha and gamma secretase (alphaCTF and gammaCTF/AICD). In contrast, it reduced the activity of beta-secretase and the level of secreted Abeta. The present results indicate that mild oxidative stress maintained throughout culturing regulates APP metabolism/processing in SK-N-MC human neuroblastoma cells.
