34116863|t|Antigen presentation in SARS-CoV-2 infection: the role of class I HLA and ERAP polymorphisms.
34116863|a|Given the highly polymorphic nature of Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) molecules, it is not surprising that they function as key regulators of the host immune response to almost all invading pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2, the etiological agent responsible for the recent COVID-19 pandemic. Several correlations have already been established between the expression of a specific HLA allele/haplotype and susceptibility/progression of SARS-CoV-2 infection and new ones are continuously emerging. Protective and harmful HLA variants have been described in both mild and severe forms of the disease, but considering the huge amount of existing variants, the data gathered in such a brief span of time are to some extent confusing and contradictory. The aim of this mini-review is to provide a snap-shot of the main findings so far collected on the HLA-SARS-CoV-2 interaction, so as to partially untangle this intricate yarn. As key factors in the generation of antigenic peptides to be presented by HLA molecules, ERAP1 and ERAP2 role in SARS-CoV-2 infection will be revised as well.
