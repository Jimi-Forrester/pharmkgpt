26757184|t|Biochemical and Radiological Markers of Alzheimer's Disease Progression.
26757184|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative, inevitably progressive disease with a rate of cognitive, functional, and behavioral decline that varies highly from patient to patient. Although several clinical predictors of AD progression have been identified, to our mind in clinical practice there is a lack of a reliable biomarker that enables one to stratify the risk of deterioration. Identification of biomarkers that allow the monitoring of AD progression could change the way physicians and caregivers make treatment decisions. This review summarizes the results of studies on potential biochemical and radiological markers related to AD progression.
