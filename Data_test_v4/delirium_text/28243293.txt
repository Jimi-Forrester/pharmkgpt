28243293|t|Effectiveness of Vitamin D Supplement Therapy in Chronic Stable Schizophrenic Male Patients: A Randomized Controlled Trial.
28243293|a|In this study, the aim was to determine whether adding vitamin D to the standard therapeutic regimen of schizophrenic male patients with inadequate vitamin D status could improve some aspects of the symptom burden or not. This study was an open parallel label randomized clinical trial. Eighty patients with chronic stable schizophrenia with residual symptoms and Vitamin D deficiency were recruited randomly and then received either 600000 IU Vitamin D injection once along with their antipsychotic regimen or with their antipsychotic regimen only. Serum vitamin D was measured twice: first at the baseline and again on the fourth month. Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) was assessed at the baseline and on the fourth month. During the study, the vitamin D serum changes in vitamin group and control group were 22.1 +- 19.9(95%CI = 15.9-28.8) and 0.2 +- 1.7(95%CI = 0.2-0.8) (ng/mL) (p<0.001) respectively. The changes of PANSS positive subscale score (P) were -0.1+-0.7 (95%CI =-0.3-0.1) and 0.00 +- 0.8 (95%CI = -0.2-0.2) in vitamin D and control group respectively (p=0.5). The changes of PANSS negative subscale score (N) were -0.1 +- 0.7 (95%CI = -0.3-0.05) and -0.1 +- 0.5 (95%CI = -0.2-0.04) in vitamin D and control group respectively (p = 0.7) and there was a negative but not significant correlation between serum vitamin D level changes and PANSS negative subscale score (r = -0.04, p = 0.7). We did not find a relationship between serum vitamin D level changes and the improvement of negative and positive symptoms in schizophrenic patients and more randomized clinical trials are required to confirm our findings.
