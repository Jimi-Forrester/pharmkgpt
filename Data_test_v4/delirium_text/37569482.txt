37569482|t|Differential Responses of Retinal Neurons and Glia Revealed via Proteomic Analysis on Primary and Secondary Retinal Ganglion Cell Degeneration.
37569482|a|To explore the temporal profile of retinal proteomes specific to primary and secondary retinal ganglion cell (RGC) loss. Unilateral partial optic nerve transection (pONT) was performed on the temporal side of the rat optic nerve. Temporal and nasal retinal samples were collected at 1, 4 and 8 weeks after pONT (n = 4 each) for non-biased profiling with a high-resolution hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry running on label-free SWATHTM acquisition (SCIEX). An information-dependent acquisition ion library was generated using ProteinPilot 5.0 and OneOmics cloud bioinformatics. Combined proteome analysis detected 2531 proteins with a false discovery rate of <1%. Compared to the nasal retina, 10, 25 and 61 significantly regulated proteins were found in the temporal retina at 1, 4, and 8 weeks, respectively (p < 0.05, FC >= 1.4 or <=0.7). Eight proteins (ALDH1A1, TRY10, GFAP, HBB-B1, ALB, CDC42, SNCG, NEFL) were differentially expressed for at least two time points. The expressions of ALDH1A1 and SNCG at nerve fibers were decreased along with axonal loss. Increased ALDH1A1 localization in the inner nuclear layer suggested stress response. Increased GFAP expression demonstrated regional reactivity of astrocytes and Muller cells. Meta-analysis of gene ontology showed a pronounced difference in endopeptidase and peptidase inhibitor activity. Temporal proteomic profiling demonstrates established and novel protein targets associated with RGC damage.
