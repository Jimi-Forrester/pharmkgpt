36801704|t|Eat for better cognition in older adults at risk for Alzheimer's disease.
36801704|a|Alzheimer's disease is a worldwide public health problem. However, the treatment method and treatment effects are limited. The stages of preclinical Alzheimer's disease are thought to be a better intervention period. Thus, in this review, food is given focus and the intervention stage put forward. We summarized the role of diet, nutrient supplementation, and microbioecologics in cognitive decline and found that interventions such as modified Mediterranean-ketogenic diet, nuts, vitamin B, and Bifidobacterium breve A1 are beneficial to cognition protection. Eating, rather than just taking medicine, is suggested to be an effective treatment method for older adults at risk for Alzheimer's disease.
