37476853|t|Fall-related Injuries and Opioid Administration Among Veterans With Dementia in US Department of Veterans Affairs Community Living Centers.
37476853|a|OBJECTIVES: Opioid use is associated with fall-related injuries (FRI) among older adults, especially those with dementia. We examined FRI following changes in national opioid safety initiatives over 3 regulatory periods [preinitiatives baseline (period 1): October 2012 to June 2013; post-Veteran Affairs (VA) opioid safety initiative (period 2): January 2014 to November 2015; post-VA and CDC opioid prescribing guidelines (period 3): March 2017 to September 2018] among Department of VA Community Living Center (CLC) long-stay residents with dementia. DATA: VA provided and purchased care records, Medicare claims, CLC Minimum Data Set (MDS) assessments. VA bar-code medication administration data, VA outpatient prescription refill data, and Medicare Part D data were used to capture medication from inpatient, outpatient, and Medicare sources. SETTINGS AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 12,229 long-stay CLC residents with dementia between October 2012 and September 2018. METHODS: We applied Veteran-regulatory period level (1) generalized linear model to examine the unadjusted and adjusted trends of FRI, and (2) difference-in-difference model with propensity score weighting to examine the relationship between opioid safety initiatives and FRI in 3 regulatory periods. We applied propensity score weighting to enable the cohorts in periods 2 and 3 had similar indications for opioid administration as in period 1. RESULTS: FRI prevalence per month among CLC residents with Alzheimer disease and related dementias decreased from 3.1% in period 1 to 1.6% and 1.2% in periods 2 and 3, and the adjusted probability of FRI was 17% and 40% lower in periods 2 and 3 compared with period 1. The any, incident, and continued opioid administration were significantly associated with higher FRI, whereas the differences in FRI probabilities between opioid and nonopioid users had no significant changes over the 3 regulatory periods. CONCLUSIONS: FRI was reduced among CLC residents with Alzheimer disease and related dementias receiving care in VA CLCs over the 3 regulatory periods, but the FRI reduction was not significantly associated with opioid safety initiatives. Other interventions that potentially targeted falls are likely to have helped reduce these fall events. Future studies could examine whether opioid use reduction ultimately benefitted nursing home residents by focusing on other possible outcomes or whether such reduction only resulted in more untreated pain.
