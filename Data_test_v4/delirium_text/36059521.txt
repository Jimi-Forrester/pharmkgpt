36059521|t|Changes in fecal microbiota composition and the cytokine expression profile in school-aged children with depression: A case-control study.
36059521|a|Depression in childhood negatively affects the growth and development, school performance, and peer or family relationships of affected children, and may even lead to suicide. Despite this, its etiology and pathophysiology remain largely unknown. Increasing evidence supports that gut microbiota plays a vital role in the development of childhood depression. However, little is known about the underlying mechanisms, as most clinical studies investigating the link between gut microbiota and depression have been undertaken in adult cohorts. In present study, a total of 140 school-aged children (6-12 years) were enrolled, including 92 with depression (male/female: 42/50) and 48 healthy controls (male/female: 22/26) from Lishui, Zhejiang, China. Illumina sequencing of the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was used to investigate gut microbiota profiles while Bio-Plex Pro Human Cytokine 27-plex Panel was employed to explore host immune response. We found that, compared with healthy controls, children with depression had greater bacterial richness and altered beta-diversity. Pro-inflammatory genera such as Streptococcus were enriched in the depression group, whereas anti-inflammatory genera such as Faecalibacterium were reduced, as determined by linear discriminant analysis effect size. These changes corresponded to altered bacterial functions, especially the production of immunomodulatory metabolites. We also identified the presence of a complex inflammatory condition in children with depression, characterized by increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-17 and decreased levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IFN-gamma. Correlation analysis demonstrated that the differential cytokine abundance was closely linked to changes in gut microbiota of children with depression. In summary, key functional genera, such as Streptococcus and Faecalibacterium, alone or in combination, could serve as novel and powerful non-invasive biomarkers to distinguish between children with depression from healthy ones. This study was the first to demonstrate that, in Chinese children with depression, gut microbiota homeostasis is disrupted, concomitant with the activation of a complex pro-inflammatory response. These findings suggest that gut microbiota might play an important role in the pathogenesis of depression in school-aged children, while key functional bacteria in gut may serve as novel targets for non-invasive diagnosis and patient-tailored early precise intervention in children with depression.
