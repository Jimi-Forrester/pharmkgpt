34728605|t|Switched Abeta43 generation in familial Alzheimer's disease with presenilin 1 mutation.
34728605|a|Presenilin (PS) with a genetic mutation generates abundant beta-amyloid protein (Abeta) 43. Senile plaques are formed by Abeta43 in the cerebral parenchyma together with Abeta42 at middle ages. These brains cause the early onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is known as familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD). Based on the stepwise processing model of Abeta generation by gamma-secretase, we reassessed the levels of Abetas in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of FAD participants. While low levels of Abeta38, Abeta40, and Abeta42 were generated in the CSF of FAD participants, the levels of Abeta43 were unchanged in some of them compared with other participants. We sought to investigate why the level of Abeta43 was unchanged in FAD participants. These characteristics of Abeta generation were observed in the gamma-secretase assay in vitro using cells, which express FAD mutations in PS1. Abeta38 and Abeta40 generation from their precursors, Abeta42 and Abeta43, was decreased in PS1 mutants compared with wild-type (WT) PS1, as observed in the CSF. Both the ratios of Abeta38/Abeta42 and Abeta40/Abeta43 in PS1 mutants were lower than those in the WT. However, the ratio of Abeta43/amyloid precursor protein intracellular domain (AICD) increased in the PS1 mutants in an onset age dependency, while other Abeta/AICD ratios were decreased or unchanged. Importantly, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry found that the generation of Abeta43 was stimulated from Abeta48 in PS1 mutants. This result indicates that PS1 mutants switched the Abeta43 generating line, which reflects the level of Abeta43 in the CSF and forming senile plaques.
