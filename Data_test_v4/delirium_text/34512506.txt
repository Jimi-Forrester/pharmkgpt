34512506|a|Background: This review describes the diagnostic and interventional procedures conducted in two university memory clinics (established network of G. Papanikolaou Hospital: 1988-2017 and AHEPA hospital: 2017-today) and 2 day care centers (established network of DCCs: 2005-today) in North Greece and their contribution in the scientific field of dementia. The aims of this work are (1) to provide a diagnosis and treatment protocol established in the network of memory clinics and DCCs and (2) to present further research conducted in the aforementioned network during the last 30 years of clinical practice. Methods: The guidelines to set a protocol demand a series of actions as follows: (1) set the diagnosis criteria, neuropsychological assessment, laboratory examinations, and examination of neurophysiological, neuroimaging, cerebrospinal fluid, blood, and genetic markers; and (2) apply non-pharmacological interventions according to the needs and specialized psychosocial interventions of the patient to the caregivers of the patient. Results: In addition to the guidelines followed in memory clinics at the 1st and 3rd Department of Neurology and two DCCs, a database of patients, educational programs, and further participation in international research programs, including clinical trials, make our contribution in the dementia field strong. Conclusion: In the current paper, we provide useful guidelines on how major and minor neurocognitive disorders are being treated in Thessaloniki, Greece, describing successful practices which have been adapted in the last 30 years.
