2128513|t|Visualization of brain monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) in dementia of Alzheimer's type by means of large cryosection autoradiography: a pilot study.
2128513|a|Quantitative autoradiography, using 3H-deprenyl, was applied to study the regional localization of MAO-B in large cryosections from 3 control brains and 3 brains from patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). High 3H-L-deprenyl binding was found in e.g. basal ganglia, cingulate gyrus, and insula cortex. Temporal cortex, parietal cortex, occipital cortex and various nuclei of the thalamus, showed moderate density, while low binding was observed in e.g. white matter. When the brains from the controls were compared with those with AD, the mean values for 3H-deprenyl binding was higher in the latter group, however, more generalised than previously reported.
