38454893|t|Psychotic Disorder after Left Posterior Cerebral Artery Stroke-An Atypical Event.
38454893|a|INTRODUCTION: Stroke survivors usually present physical and neuropsychiatric complications. Post-stroke psychosis (PSPsy) is a particularly neglected sequel despite its disruptive nature. OBJECTIVES: To present a case of early emerging neuropsychiatric symptoms following a left posterior cerebral artery (PCA) stroke. To review and discuss PSPsy clinical manifestations, pathophysiology, and clinical outcomes. CLINICAL CASE: A previously autonomous 68-year-old woman with vascular risk factors and depressive disorder presented to the emergency department with a 5-day history of disorientation, motor aphasia, and right hypoesthesia. Computer tomography revealed a left PCA stroke. She was started on acetylsalicylic acid and rosuvastatin and discharged the next day. Afterward, the patient developed a depressive mood, emotional lability, periods of confusion, delusions of persecution, guilt and unworthiness, auditory hallucinations, and suicide ideation. She was admitted to a psychiatric hospital and started on risperidone with a good response, being discharged after 15 days with the resolution of psychiatric symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: PSPsy is more common after right hemisphere lesions and usually develops after some months. Nevertheless, our patient presented PSPsy following an ischemic event of the left PCA, with neuropsychiatric symptomatology dominating the clinic since the beginning. The involvement of the retrosplenial cortex or its connections was likely important for this atypical presentation. Due to the lack of guidelines on approaching PSPsy, most patients are treated with the same strategies used for non-stroke patients. A better comprehension of the anatomical basis underlining the symptomatology in these patients could deepen the understanding of psychosis and psychotic disorders.
