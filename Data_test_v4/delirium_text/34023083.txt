34023083|t|The Nexus Between Sleep Disturbance and Delirium Among Intensive Care Patients.
34023083|a|Sleep in intensive care is hampered due to many factors; the clinical environment itself exacerbates sleep disturbance. Research suggests that interventions aimed at improving sleep quality have produced positive effects in reducing incidences and duration of delirium. Sleep disturbance is well documented among intensive care patients; however, its prognostic impact is not fully understood. Delirium, disproportionally prevalent among intensive care patients, has significant prognostic factors related to patient outcomes, in which sleep disturbance often is present. The relationship between sleep disturbance and delirium is complex, sharing commonalities in relation to neurobiological and neurohormonal alterations, which may contribute to a bidirectional relationship.
