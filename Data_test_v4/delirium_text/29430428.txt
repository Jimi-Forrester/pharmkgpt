29430428|a|BACKGROUND: Few studies have evaluated the long-term impact of postoperative infectious complications in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We aimed to determine the impact of infectious complications on long-term outcomes after surgical resection for NSCLC. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of 1,380 eligible patients who underwent pulmonary resection for NSCLC from 2003 to 2012. Complications were divided into infectious complications and non-infectious complications. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to compare unadjusted 5-year cancer-specific survival (CSS) rates and recurrence-free survival (RFS) rates. Cox regression was used to determine the impact of infectious complications on 5-year CSS and RFS. RESULTS: The rate of total complications and infectious complications was 24.3% and 4.3%, respectively. In the node-negative subgroup, the 5-year CSS and RFS rates were 75.9% and 57.1% in patients who had infectious complications, compared to 87.9% and 78.4% in patients who had no complications. Infectious complications were a negative prognostic factor for 5-year RFS (hazard ratio, 1.92; 95% confidence interval, 1.00-3.69; p=0.049). In the node-positive subgroup, the 5-year CSS rate and RFS were 44.6% and 48.4% in patients who had infectious complications, compared to 70.5% and 48.4% for patients who had no complications. CONCLUSION: Postoperative infectious complications had a negative impact on CSS and RFS in node-negative NSCLC. Our findings may help improve risk assessment for tumor recurrence after pulmonary resection for node-negative NSCLC.
