35572130|t|Bioinformatics Analysis of Publicly Available Single-Nuclei Transcriptomics Alzheimer's Disease Datasets Reveals APOE Genotype-Specific Changes Across Cell Types in Two Brain Regions.
35572130|a|Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disease that gravely affects patients and imposes an immense burden on caregivers. Apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) has been identified as the most common genetic risk factor for AD, yet the molecular mechanisms connecting APOE4 to AD are not well understood. Past transcriptomic analyses in AD have revealed APOE genotype-specific transcriptomic differences; however, these differences have not been explored at a single-cell level. To elucidate more complex APOE genotype-specific disease-relevant changes masked by the bulk analysis, we leverage the first two single-nucleus RNA sequencing AD datasets from human brain samples, including nearly 55,000 cells from the prefrontal and entorhinal cortices. In each brain region, we performed a case versus control APOE genotype-stratified differential gene expression analysis and pathway network enrichment in astrocytes, microglia, neurons, oligodendrocytes, and oligodendrocyte progenitor cells. We observed more global transcriptomic changes in APOE4 positive AD cells and identified differences across APOE genotypes primarily in glial cell types. Our findings highlight the differential transcriptomic perturbations of APOE isoforms at a single-cell level in AD pathogenesis and have implications for precision medicine development in the diagnosis and treatment of AD.
