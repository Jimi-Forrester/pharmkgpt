21894099|t|Unusual presentation of a patient with GBL withdrawal: a case report.
21894099|a|GBL (gamma-butyro-lactone) is converted to Gamma hydroxyl butyrate (GHB) in the body. GBL and GHB are available in liquid form and powder form. Once categorised under "legal highs", these two are not associated with any dependence or withdrawal in animal studies. But there are case reports indicating their high dependence potential in humans. We here present a case of a 29 year old who came to the attention of psychiatric services with very bizarre presentation and needed a host of investigations and expert views from various medical disciplines. He was treated mainly symptomatically followed by a sudden dramatic recovery on the 11th day after presentation. GBL is getting popular as a recreational drug and its withdrawal should be seriously considered in the list of medical causes leading to Delirium.
