38933814|t|Combination of static and dynamic neural imaging features to distinguish sensorineural hearing loss: a machine learning study.
38933814|a|Purpose: Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) is the most common form of sensory deprivation and is often unrecognized by patients, inducing not only auditory but also nonauditory symptoms. Data-driven classifier modeling with the combination of neural static and dynamic imaging features could be effectively used to classify SNHL individuals and healthy controls (HCs). Methods: We conducted hearing evaluation, neurological scale tests and resting-state MRI on 110 SNHL patients and 106 HCs. A total of 1,267 static and dynamic imaging characteristics were extracted from MRI data, and three methods of feature selection were computed, including the Spearman rank correlation test, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and t test as well as LASSO. Linear, polynomial, radial basis functional kernel (RBF) and sigmoid support vector machine (SVM) models were chosen as the classifiers with fivefold cross-validation. The receiver operating characteristic curve, area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were calculated for each model. Results: SNHL subjects had higher hearing thresholds in each frequency, as well as worse performance in cognitive and emotional evaluations, than HCs. After comparison, the selected brain regions using LASSO based on static and dynamic features were consistent with the between-group analysis, including auditory and nonauditory areas. The subsequent AUCs of the four SVM models (linear, polynomial, RBF and sigmoid) were as follows: 0.8075, 0.7340, 0.8462 and 0.8562. The RBF and sigmoid SVM had relatively higher accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. Conclusion: Our research raised attention to static and dynamic alterations underlying hearing deprivation. Machine learning-based models may provide several useful biomarkers for the classification and diagnosis of SNHL.
