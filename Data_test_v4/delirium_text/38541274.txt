38541274|t|Frailty in an Adult Acute Hospital Population: Predictors, Prevalence, and Outcomes.
38541274|a|Frailty is common among older hospital inpatients. While studies describe frailty prevalence in acute hospitals, it is usually based upon retrospective hospital-coded data or brief screening on admission rather than comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA). Further, little is known about differences between pre-admission and current frailty status. Given this, we investigated the prevalence of pre-frailty and frailty among adult inpatients in a large university hospital after CGA. Of the 410 inpatients available, 398 were included in the study, with a median age of 70 years; 56% were male. The median length of stay (LOS) at review was 8 days. The point prevalence of frailty was 30% versus 14% for pre-frailty. The median Clinical Frailty Scale score pre-admission was 3/9, which was significantly lower than at review, which was 4/9 (p < 0.001). After adjusting for age and sex, frailty was associated with greater odds of prolonged LOS (odds ratio [OR] 1.7, p = 0.045), one-year mortality (OR 2.1, p = 0.006), and one-year institutionalisation (OR 9, p < 0.001) but not re-admission. Frailty was most prevalent on medical and orthopaedic wards. In conclusion, CGA is an important risk assessment for hospitalised patients. Frailty was highly prevalent and associated with poor healthcare outcomes. Frailty status appears to worsen significantly during admission, likely reflecting acute illness, and it may not reflect a patient's true frailty level. The development of frailty clinical care pathways is recommended in order to address the poor prognosis associated with a diagnosis of frailty in this setting.
