29522388|t|Alzheimer dementia: Starting, stopping drug therapy.
29522388|a|Alzheimer disease is the most common type of dementia. Two classes of cognition-enhancing drugs are approved to treat the symptoms, and both have provided modest benefit in clinical trials. Psychotropic drugs are sometimes used off-label to treat behavioral symptoms of Alzheimer disease. All these medications should be continuously evaluated for clinical efficacy and, when appropriate, discontinued if the primary benefit--preservation of cognitive and functional status and a reduction in behaviors associated with dementia--is no longer being achieved.
