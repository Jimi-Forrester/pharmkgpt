3984614|t|[Age and the tempo of the progression of alcoholism in patients with a history of alcoholic delirium].
3984614|a|The differentiation of psychotic and non-psychotic forms of alcoholism on the basis of the epidemiological data on some clinical characteristics of alcohol pathology over the period of 1975-1982 has shown that the pathomorphism of the clinical manifestations of alcoholism and alcoholic psychosis depends on a complex of social and biological factors. A more considerable involvement of biological factors in determining the age of the onset of alcohol psychoses has been demonstrated. The clinico-anthropometric and clinico-statistical studies of 230 alcoholics of two age groups with a history of delirium tremens has prompted the conclusion as to a considerable influence of the age factor on the change in the clinical picture of the disease and its progression.
