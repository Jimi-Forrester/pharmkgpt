33467075|a|Recent clinical and epidemiological studies support the contention that diabetes mellitus (DM) is a strong risk factor for the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The use of insulin cell toxin, streptozotocin (STZ), when injected into the lateral ventricles, develops an insulin resistant brain state (IRBS) and represents a non-transgenic, or sporadic AD model (SAD), with several AD-like neuropathological features. The present study explored the effects of an anti-diabetic drug, liraglutide (LIR), in reversing major pathological hallmarks in the prodromal disease stage of both the 5xFAD transgenic and SAD mouse models of AD. Three-month-old 5xFAD and age-matched wild type mice were given a single intracerebroventricular (i.c.v) injection of STZ or vehicle (saline) and were subsequently treated with LIR, intraperitoneally (IP), once a day for 30 days. The extent of neurodegeneration, Abeta plaque load, and key proteins associated with the insulin signaling pathways were measured using Western blot and neuroinflammation (via immunohistological assays) in the cortical and hippocampal regions of the brain were assessed following a series of behavioral tests used to measure cognitive function after LIR or vehicle treatments. Our results indicated that STZ significantly increased neuroinflammation, Abeta plaque deposition and disrupted insulin signaling pathway, while 25 nmol/kg LIR, when injected IP, significantly decreased neuroinflammatory responses in both SAD and 5xFAD mice before significant cognitive changes were observed, suggesting LIR can reduce early neuropathology markers prior to the emergence of overt memory deficits. Our results indicate that LIR has neuroprotective effects and has the potential to serve as an anti-inflammatory and anti-amyloid prophylactic therapy in the prodromal stages of AD.
