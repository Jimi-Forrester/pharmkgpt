37293028|a|Background: Over 65% of American women are overweight or obese. Obesity and the closely related metabolic syndrome increase the probability for developing several diseases, including cardiovascular disease (CVD). Chronic low-grade inflammation has been recognized as an underlying event linking obesity to CVD. However, inflammatory alterations in individuals who are overweight remain understudied. To provide insight, we performed a pilot study to determine the levels of key circulating biomarkers of endotoxemia and inflammation in overweight vs. lean women with high cholesterol and/or high blood pressure - two important conventional risk factors for CVD. Methods: Plasma samples from adult female subjects who were lean (n=20, BMI=22.4+-1.6 kg/m 2 ) or overweight (n=20, BMI=27.0+-1.5 kg/m 2 ) with similar ages (55.65+-9.1 years and 59.7+-6.1 years), and race/ethnicity, and self-reported high cholesterol and/or high blood pressure were analyzed and compared. Samples were obtained through the Northwell Health "Genotype and Phenotype, GaP" registry. Plasma levels of lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP), CRP, IL-6, leptin, and adiponectin were analyzed using commercially available assay kits. Results: Plasma levels of LBP (a recognized marker of metabolic endotoxemia in obesity) were significantly higher in the overweight group compared with the lean group (p=0.005). The levels of CRP, a general marker of inflammation, were also significantly higher in overweight subjects (p=0.01), as were those of the cytokine IL-6 (p=0.02) and the adipokine leptin (p=0.002), pro-inflammatory mediators associated with cardiovascular risk. Levels of adiponectin, an adipokine with anti-inflammatory and anti-atherogenic functions, were significantly lower in the overweight group (p=0.002). The leptin/adiponectin ratio, a preferential atherogenic marker was significantly increased in women who are overweight (p=0.02). Alterations in LBP, CRP, leptin, and adiponectin significantly correlated with BMI, but not with age. The absolute levels of these analytes were within the ranges reported for healthy subjects evaluated in larger clinical trials and thus can be classified as consistent with subclinical endotoxemia. Conclusion: These results document the presence of a pro-inflammatory state in overweight compared with lean women and are of interest for further evaluation of evidence of inflammation in overweight individuals as an additional risk factor for cardiometabolic disease.
