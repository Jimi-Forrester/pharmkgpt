31412783|t|A case of hyperventilation leading to apnea and desaturation in PACU.
31412783|a|BACKGROUND: Respiratory adverse events are not uncommon in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) following general anesthesia. In this regard, hyperventilation leading to apnea and desaturation is a rare entity. Here we have reported a case of a 15-year-old girl who, following an uneventful general anesthesia, developed severe hyperventilation leading to apnea and desaturation in the PACU. CASE PRESENTATION: The 15-year-old girl underwent cortical mastoidectomy under general anesthesia. After a smooth anesthesia and an uneventful early recovery, she developed hyperventilation after about 15 min in the PACU. The symptom was severe enough to lead to apnea, desaturation and severe respiratory alkalosis. She required bag and mask ventilation and the symptoms resolved only transiently with propofol sedation. Finally, she responded to intravenous haloperidol and did not have any further episode after receiving haloperidol. CONCLUSION: Hyperventilation after a smooth recovery from anesthesia is not a common presentation. In this article we have tried to discuss the possible cause of such symptom in our patient and how we successfully managed this case. We have also proposed an algorithmic approach to diagnose and manage such cases in the PACU.
