35871332|t|Incidental Finding: Urine Alzheimer-Associated Neuronal Thread Protein (AD7c-NTP) and Serum Vitamin D25.
35871332|a|BACKGROUND: National and international experts have been attempting to find diagnostic tools for the early identification of symptoms to facilitate early identification and intervention of the disease. OBJECTIVE: Detection of urine Alzheimer-associated neuronal thread protein (AD7c-NTP) and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: Subjects aged >50 years who underwent a physical examination at the Taihu Sanatorium of Jiangsu Province, had no clinical evidence of AD-related issues, and had normal Mini-Mental State Exam and Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores were enrolled in the present study. There were 35 males and 15 females, who were aged 51-91 years. Urine AD7c-NTP levels and serum 25(OH)D concentrations were measured. RESULTS: The Pearson correlation analysis revealed that the urine AD7c-NTP levels in these subjects were negatively correlated with the serum 25(OH)D concentrations (r = -0.460, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Combined with previous studies, it was considered that cognitive function might be the only link for the correlation between AD7c-NTP and 25(OH)D. This finding might provide a starting point to investigate the potential value of the interaction between urine AD7c-NTP and serum 25(OH)D in chronic diseases. Further large-scale studies are needed to validate the results of the present study.
