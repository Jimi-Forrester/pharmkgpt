38109303|a|Traumatic brain injury (TBI) occurs worldwide and is associated with high mortality and disability rate. Apoptosis induced by TBI is one of the important causes of secondary injury after TBI. Notoginsenoside R1 (NGR1) is the main phytoestrogen extracted from Panax notoginseng. Many studies have shown that NGR1 has potent neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic properties and is effective in ischemia-reperfusion injury. Therefore, we investigated the potential neuroprotective effects of NGR1 after TBI and explored its molecular mechanism of action. A rat model of TBI was established using the controlled cortical impact (CCI) method. The expression levels of Bcl-2, Bax, caspase 3, and ERK1/2-related molecules in the downstream pathway were also detected by western blotting. The expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines were detected by real-time quantitative PCR. Nissl staining was used to clarify the morphological changes around the injury foci in rats after TBI. Fluoro-Jade B (FJB) and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) dUTP Nick-End Labeling (TUNEL) fluorescence staining were used to detect the apoptosis of neural cells in each group of rats. The results showed that NGR1 administration reduced neurological deficits after TBI, as well as brain edema and brain tissue apoptosis. It also significantly inhibited the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, NGR1 decreased the expression levels of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and p-RSK1, which are phosphorylated after trauma. This study suggests that NGR1 can improve neuronal apoptosis in brain injury by inhibiting the ERK signaling pathway. NGR1 is a potential novel neuroprotective agent for the treatment of secondary brain injury after TBI.
