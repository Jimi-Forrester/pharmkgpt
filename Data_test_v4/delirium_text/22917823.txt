22917823|a|INTRODUCTION: Delirium is a temporary mental disorder that frequently occurs among elderly hospitalized patients. Patients who undergo cardiac operations have an increased risk of postoperative delirium, which is associated with higher mortality and morbidity rates, a prolonged hospital stay, and reduced cognitive and functional recovery. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In our prospective study, we included 370 consecutive adult patients who underwent on-pump coronary artery surgery between January 1, 2011, and July 1, 2011. We selected 21 potential risk factors and divided them into preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative groups. Delirium was diagnosed with the Confusion Assessment Method. RESULTS: Postoperative delirium was diagnosed in 74 patients (20%). Four predictive factors were associated with postoperative delirium: diabetes mellitus, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral vascular disease, and prolonged intubation (P < .05). CONCLUSION: Three of the four predictive factors significantly associated with delirium are preoperative. They are relatively easy to measure and can be used to identify patients at higher risk. Fast extubation of these patients and preventive interventions can be taken to prevent negative consequences of this postoperative complication.
