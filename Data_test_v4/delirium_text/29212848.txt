29212848|a|Previous evidence suggest involvement of the complement receptor 1 (CR1) in development of Alzheimer's disease. We investigated the association of CR1 gene polymorphisms with cognitive function in older subjects. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the CR1 region on chromosome 1 ( n = 73) were assessed in 5,244 participants in the PROspective Study of Pravastatin in the Elderly at Risk (51.9% female, mean age 75.3 yr). Linear regression, adjusted for age, sex, country, and use of pravastatin, was used to assess the association between the SNPs and cognitive function. All 73 SNPs within the genomic region of the CR1 gene on chromosome 1 were extracted. Eighteen were independent, according to a relatively stringent R2 threshold of >0.8 with LDlink. Twelve of the 18 investigated CR1 SNPs were significantly associated with a decline in cognitive function (all P < 0.05). These data indicate that genetic variation within the CR1 gene is associated not only with Alzheimer's disease, but also with general cognitive function during late life.
