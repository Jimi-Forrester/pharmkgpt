22698678|t|Cross-cultural difference and validation of the Chinese version of Montreal Cognitive Assessment in older adults residing in Eastern China: preliminary findings.
22698678|a|To evaluate the psychometric properties of the Chinese Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA-C) and assess cross-cultural differences in a community-based cohort residing in the Eastern China. The study included 72 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), 84 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 146 cognitively normal controls. Sensitivities and specificities were calculated using the recommended cut-off scores. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analyses were performed to determine optimal sensitivity and specificity. Criterion validity, inter-rater, test-retest reliability and internal consistencies of the MoCA-C were examined, and clinical observations made. The influence of age, education level and gender on MoCA score was examined. Using the recommended cut-off score of 26, the area under the ROC (AUC) for predicting MCI groups using the MoCA-C was 0.930 (95%CI: 0.894; 0.965). The MoCA-C demonstrated 92% sensitivity and 85% specificity in screening for MCI. Cultural differences from the original MoCA affected the test response rate. The MoCA-C appears to have utility as a cognitive screen for early detection of AD and for MCI and warrants further investigation regarding its applicability in primary care settings in elderly Chinese people. It will be necessary to revise the contents of the questionnaire to account for by local characteristics.
