31323844|t|Phosphorene Is the New Graphene in Biomedical Applications.
31323844|a|Nowadays, the research of smart materials is focusing on the allotropics, which have specific characteristics that are useful in several areas, including biomedical applications. In recent years, graphene has revealed interesting antibacterial and physical peculiarities, but it has also shown limitations. Black phosphorus has structural and biochemical properties that make it ideal for biomedical applications: 2D sheets of black phosphorus are called Black Phosphorene (BP), and it could replace graphene in the coming years. BP, similar to other 2D materials, can be used for colorimetric and fluorescent detectors, as well as for biosensing devices. BP also shows high in vivo biodegradability, producing non-toxic agents in the body. This characteristic is promising for pharmacological applications, as well as for scaffold and prosthetic coatings. BP shows low cytotoxicity, thus avoiding the induction of local inflammation or toxicity. As such, BP is a good candidate for different applications in the biomedical sector. Properties such as biocompatibility, biodegradability, and biosafety are essential for use in medicine. In this review, we have exploited all such aspects, also comparing BP with other similar materials, such as the well-known graphene.
