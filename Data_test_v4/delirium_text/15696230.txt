15696230|a|The Akt signaling pathway plays a crucial role in neuronal survival, leading to inhibition of apoptosis. Many stimulants including neurotrophins are reported to activate this pathway in preclinical studies; however, there are no drugs for neurodegenerative diseases adopting such a concept on the market so far. Among neurodegenerative diseases, Alzheimer's disease is the most common and characterized by senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, which consist of beta-amyloid and hyperphosphorylated tau, respectively. Recent studies suggest that activation of Akt inhibits toxicity of beta-amyloid and formation of neurofibrillary tangles, leading to protection of neurons against apoptosis. This review discusses the possibility of treatment of Alzheimer's disease by activating the Akt signaling pathway.
