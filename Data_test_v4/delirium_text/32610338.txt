MATERIALS AND METHODS: Scalp EEG data were obtained from 51 patients with AD to investigate the presence of four NPS subdomains, hyperactivity, psychosis, affective symptoms, and apathy. EEG power spectra and the standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA)-localized EEG cortical sources were compared between the groups with and without the four NPS subdomains in eight frequency bands: 1-4, 4-8, 8-10, 10-12, 12-18, 18-20, 20-30, and 30-45 Hz. RESULTS: The power spectral analysis of EEG data showed that AD patients with psychosis had lower values at the alpha2-band in most areas. In patients with apathy, the theta-to-beta power ratio showed a greater activity over the frontal and central regions. The cortical source analysis using sLORETA revealed that patients with psychosis showed decreased values in the alpha2-band and patients with apathy showed higher delta-values, especially in the right frontal and temporal regions. CONCLUSION: The results of the present study showed that both classical EEG spectral and EEG source analysis could differentiate patients with and without NPSs, especially psychosis and apathy subdomains. Spectral and sLORETA analyses provided information helpful for a better characterization in patients with NPSs.
