12927946|a|UNLABELLED: This article describes a comprehensive cognitive-linguistic intervention program for mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients that provided communication skills practice in the context of health-enhancing and esteem-building community-based activities: physical fitness training and supervised volunteer work. The interventions were administered by undergraduate students who completed academic work, received faculty supervision, and earned three credits for one semester of participation. Effects of the interventions on the discourse of four participants who completed all 4 years of the program are reported in detail. The maintained or improved performance on multiple discourse outcome measures provides powerful rationale for making such interventions more widely available and preliminary support for their effectiveness in preserving communicative function. An additional role for speech-language pathologists (SLPs)--as trainers and supervisors of non-professional rehab partners for persons with dementia--is proposed. LEARNING OUTCOMES: From this article, participants will be able to (1) list specific language tasks that can be used to assess discourse in individuals with AD; (2) identify several cognitive-linguistic interventions appropriate for use with AD patients; and (3) understand how long-term cognitive-linguistic interventions may affect the language performance of individuals with AD.
