10629358|a|Concentrations of alpha(1)-antichymotrypsin (ACT) were measured in serum or plasma samples from 137 patients with late-onset probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 89 controls. Levels of ACT from sera or plasma from both AD or controls were different, being highest in serum samples. Increased levels of serum or plasma ACT and normal levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) were found in AD. Differences in serum ACT levels between AD and controls were statistically significant, while those in plasma ACT were not. ACT serum levels were higher in women with AD that in female and male controls. Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotypes did not independently affect blood ACT levels in both AD and controls; although, among AD patients, female AD patients with APOE 4,4 showed the highest level of serum ACT. The gender effect appeared to be prominent, since female AD patients with APOE 3,3 had similar ACT levels to those of female AD patients with APOE 4,4.
