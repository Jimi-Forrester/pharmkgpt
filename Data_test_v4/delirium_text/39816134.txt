39816134|t|Revealing the dance of NLRP3: spatiotemporal patterns in inflammasome activation.
39816134|a|The nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich repeat, and pyrin domain containing-protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is a multiprotein complex that plays a critical role in the innate immune response to both infections and sterile stressors. Dysregulated NLRP3 activation has been implicated in a variety of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, including cryopyrin-associated periodic fever syndromes, diabetes, atherosclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and cancer. Consequently, fine-tuning NLRP3 activity holds significant therapeutic potential. Studies have implicated several organelles, including mitochondria, lysosomes, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the Golgi apparatus, endosomes, and the centrosome, in NLRP3 localization and inflammasome assembly. However, reports of conflict and many factors regulating interactions between NLRP3 and subcellular organelles remain unknown. This review synthesizes the current understanding of NLRP3 spatiotemporal dynamics, focusing on recent literature that elucidates the roles of subcellular localization and organelle stress in NLRP3 signaling and its crosstalk with other innate immune pathways converging at these organelles.
