32865653|t|On the reproducibility of hippocampal MEGA-sLASER GABA MRS at 7T using an optimized analysis pipeline.
32865653|a|OBJECTIVES: GABA is the most important inhibitory neurotransmitter. Thus, variation in its concentration is connected to a wide variety of diseases. However, the low concentration and the overlap of more prominent resonances hamper GABA quantification using MR spectroscopy. The hippocampus plays a pivotal role in neurodegeneration. Susceptibility discontinuities in the vicinity of the hippocampus cause strong B0 inhomogeneities, impeding GABA spectroscopy. The aim of this work is to improve the reproducibility of hippocampal GABA+ MRS. METHODS: The GABA+/total creatine ratio in the hippocampus was measured using a MEGA-sLASER sequence at 7 Tesla. 10 young healthy volunteers participated in the study. A dedicated pre-processing approach was established. Spectral quantification was performed with Tarquin. The quantification parameters were carefully adjusted to ensure optimal quantification. RESULTS: An inter-subject coefficient of variation of the GABA+/total creatine of below 15% was achieved. Additional to spectral registration, which is essential to obtain reproducible GABA measures, eddy current compensation and additional difference artifact suppression improved the reproducibility. The mean FWHM was 23.1 Hz (0.078 ppm). CONCLUSION: The increased spectral dispersion of ultra-high-field spectroscopy allows for reproducible spectral quantification, despite a very broad line width. The achieved reproducibility enables the routine use of hippocampal GABA spectroscopy at 7 Tesla.
