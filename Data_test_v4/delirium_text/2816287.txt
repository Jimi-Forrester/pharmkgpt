2816287|t|Glucose metabolism and rate constants in Alzheimer's disease examined with dynamic positron emission tomography scan.
2816287|a|Glucose metabolic rate constants in patients with Alzheimer's disease were analyzed using dynamic positron emission tomography with [18-F] fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (FDG). The cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (CMRG) was calculated using obtained rate constants, as well as the autoradiographic method. The half-life and distribution volume of FDG between the blood and the brain tissue were also calculated from obtained metabolic rate constants. The most severely affected metabolic step was the phosphorylation of glucose in the parietotemporal regions. The distribution volume of FDG showed no remarkable deviation from normal controls, while the half-life of FDG was found to be longer in the parietal and temporal regions. The CMRG from rate constants and that from the autoradiographic method showed no remarkable differences.
