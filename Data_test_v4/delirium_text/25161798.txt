25161798|t|The Association between Apolipoprotein E Gene Polymorphism and Mild Cognitive Impairment among Different Ethnic Minority Groups in China.
25161798|a|The association, in different ethnic groups, of apolipoprotein E (apoE) gene polymorphism with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) has been unclear. Few studies have examined the association in Chinese minorities. The current study explores the association between apoE gene polymorphism and MCI in one of the biggest ethnic groups-the Hui-and compares it with the Han. The Minimental State Exam, Activities of Daily Living Scale, and Geriatric Depression Scale were administered to 306 ethnic Hui and 618 ethnic Han people aged >=55 years. ApoE genotypes were determined using the high resolution melting curve method. The distribution of the apoE genotype and the frequency of alleles epsilon2, epsilon3, and epsilon4 were similar in the Hui and Han groups. In analyses adjusted for age, gender, and education level, the epsilon4 allele was a risk factor for MCI in both the Hui group (OR = 2.61, 95% CI: 1.02-6.66) and the Han group (OR = 2.36, 95% CI: 1.19-4.67), but the apoE epsilon2 allele was protective for MCI only in the Han group (OR = 0.48, 95% CI: 0.38-0.88). The association of some apoE genotypes with MCI may differ in different ethnic groups in China. Further studies are needed to explore this effect among different populations.
