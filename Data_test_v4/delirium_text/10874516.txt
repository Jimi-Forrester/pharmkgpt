10874516|t|Neuronal response to physical injury and its relationship to the pathology of Alzheimer's disease.
10874516|a|1. Central nerve cells undergo a stereotyped regenerative response following physical injury. 2. This reaction involves adaptive changes within the axon and cell body of origin, directed at sprouting and synaptogenesis. 3. Intimately associated with the regenerative response are specific alterations to cytoskeletal proteins, including the neurofilament (NF) triplet. 4. The morphological and neurochemical alterations to NF within axons following injury are reminiscent of plaque-associated dystrophic neurites (DN) in early Alzheimer's disease (AD). 5. Associated changes in perikaryal NF resemble Alzheimer neurofibrillary tangle pathology, while growth-associated sprouting markers are localized to the abnormal neurites of AD. 6. The present review postulates that beta-amyloid plaques in AD cause physical damage to local nerve cell processes and it is the chronic stimulation of the stereotyped response to injury that results in the end-stage pathology and neurodegeneration associated with AD.
