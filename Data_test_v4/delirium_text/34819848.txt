34819848|a|There is increasing evidence to show that motor symptom lateralization in Parkinson's disease (PD) is linked to non-motor features, progression, and prognosis of the disease. However, few studies have reported the difference in cortical complexity between patients with left-onset of PD (LPD) and right-onset of PD (RPD). This study aimed to investigate the differences in the cortical complexity between early-stage LPD and RPD. High-resolution T1-weighted magnetic resonance images of the brain were acquired in 24 patients with LPD, 34 patients with RPD, and 37 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HCs). Cortical complexity including gyrification index, fractal dimension (FD), and sulcal depth was analyzed using surface-based morphometry via CAT12/SPM12. Familywise error (FWE) peak-level correction at p < 0.05 was performed for significance testing. In patients with RPD, we found decreased mean FD and mean sulcal depth in the banks of the left superior temporal sulcus (STS) compared with LPD and HCs. The mean FD in the left superior temporal gyrus (STG) was decreased in RPD compared with HCs. However, in patients with LPD, we did not identify significantly abnormal cortical complex change compared with HCs. Moreover, we observed that the mean FD in STG was negatively correlated with the 17-item Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD) among the three groups. Our findings support the specific influence of asymmetrical motor symptoms in cortical complexity in early-stage PD and reveal that the banks of left STS and left STG might play a crucial role in RPD.
