26714266|t|Tracking Parkinson's Disease over One Year with Multimodal Magnetic Resonance Imaging in a Group of Older Patients with Moderate Disease.
26714266|a|BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Cross-sectional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) suggests that Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with changes in cerebral tissue volume, diffusion tensor imaging metrics, and perfusion values. Here, we performed a longitudinal multimodal MRI study--including structural, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and perfusion MRI--to investigate progressive brain changes over one year in a group of older PD patients at a moderate stage of disease. METHODS: Twenty-three non-demented PD (mean age (SD) = 69.5 (6.4) years, disease duration (SD) = 5.6 (4.3) years) and 23 matched control participants (mean age: 70.6 (6.8)) completed extensive neuropsychological and clinical assessment, and multimodal 3T MRI scanning at baseline and one year later. We used a voxel-based approach to assess change over time and group-by-time interactions for cerebral structural and perfusion metrics. RESULTS: Compared to controls, in PD participants there was localized grey matter atrophy over time in bilateral inferior and right middle temporal, and left orbito-frontal cortices. Using a voxel-based approach that focused on the centers of principal white matter tracts, the PD and control cohorts exhibited similar levels of change in DTI metrics. There was no significant change in perfusion, cognitive, or motor severity measures. CONCLUSIONS: In a cohort of older, non-demented PD participants, macrostructural MRI detected atrophy in the PD group compared with the control group in temporal and orbito-frontal cortices. Changes in diffusion MRI along principal white matter tracts over one year were found, but this was not differentially affected by PD.
