31045827|t|Efficacy of dexmedetomidine for treatment of patients with sepsis: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.
31045827|a|BACKGROUND: This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the effect of dexmedetomidine on prognosis in patients with sepsis. METHODS: Computer-related electronic databases were searched, including PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, and the China National Knowledge Infrastructure, from the date of database construction to January 2019. Stata 12.0 was used to perform a meta-analysis of short-term mortality [intensive care unit (ICU) mortality or 28-day mortality], ICU length of stay, and mechanical ventilation. Mortality was expressed using risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). ICU length of stay and mechanical ventilation were expressed as weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% CIs. RESULTS: We finally included 8 randomized controlled trials in this meta-analysis. Compared with the control group, the dexmedetomidine group had a lower occurrence of 28-day mortality (RR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.35 to 0.69; P = .000) and ICU mortality (RR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.23 to 0.84; P = .013). However, there was no statistically significant difference for the length of hospital stay (WMD, -0.05; 95% CI, -0.59 to 0.48; P = .840) and mechanical ventilation time (WMD, 1.05; 95% CI, -0.27 to 2.37; P = .392) between dexmedetomidine group and control group. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with sepsis, dexmedetomidine can reduce the short-term mortality of patients, but could not shorten the ICU length of stay and mechanical ventilation time. More clinical randomized controlled trials are needed to verify the efficacy and safety of dexmedetomidine on the length of hospital stay and mechanical ventilation time.
