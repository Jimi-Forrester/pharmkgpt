32923455|a|Previous studies from this lab have determined that dedifferentiation of Muller glia occurs after eye drop application of an alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) agonist, PNU-282987, to the adult rodent eye. PNU-282987 acts on alpha7 nAChRs on retinal pigment epithelial cells to stimulate production of Muller-derived progenitor cells (MDPCs) and ultimately lead to neurogenesis. This current study was designed to test the hypothesis that the activation of genes involved in the HB-EGF/Ascl1/Lin28a signaling pathway in Muller glia leads to the genesis of MDPCs. RNA-seq was performed on a Muller glial cell line (rMC-1) following contact with supernatant collected from a retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cell line treated with PNU-282987. Differentially regulated genes were compared with published literature of Muller glia dedifferentiation that occurs in lower vertebrate regeneration and early mammalian development. HB-EGF was significantly up-regulated by 8 h and expression increased through 12 h. By 48 h, up-regulation of Ascl1 and Lin28a was observed, two genes known to be rapidly induced in dedifferentiating zebrafish Muller glia. Up-regulation of other genes known to be involved in mammalian development and zebrafish regeneration were also observed, as well as down-regulation of some factors necessary for Muller glia cell identity. RNA-seq results were verified using qRT-PCR. Using immunocytochemistry, the presence of markers associated with MDCP identity, Otx2, Nestin, and Vsx2, were found to be expressed in the 48 h treatment group cultures. This study is novel in its demonstration that Muller glia in adult rodents can be induced into regenerative activity by stimulating genes involved in the HB-EGF/Ascl1/Lin28a pathway that leads to MDPCs after introducing conditioned media from PNU-282987 treated RPE. This study furthers our understanding of the mechanism by which Muller glia dedifferentiate in response to PNU-282987 in the adult mammalian retina.
