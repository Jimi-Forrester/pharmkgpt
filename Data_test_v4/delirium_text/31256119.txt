31256119|t|A Birth Cohort Analysis of Amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment Incidence in the Einstein Aging Study (EAS) Cohort.
31256119|a|BACKGROUND: The transition from normal cognition to Alzheimer's disease is considered a continuum, with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) an intermediate clinical cognitive state. Although prior work suggests that dementia incidence rates may be declining, there is little information regarding temporal trends in aMCI incidence. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether age specific rates of aMCI have changed over sequential birth cohorts among individuals included in the population-based Einstein Aging Study (EAS) cohort. A secondary objective was to examine trends in aMCI rates among Blacks and Whites and by sex. METHODS: Age specific incidence of aMCI was examined by birth year among 1,233 individuals age 70 years and above enrolled in the population-based EAS cohort between November 1, 1993 and February 22, 2016 and who had at least one annual follow-up assessment (5,321 person years of follow-up). Poisson regression was used to determine whether there has been a change in age specific aMCI rates over sequential years of birth. RESULTS: No significant change in aMCI rates was identified in the overall cohort, among Blacks or Whites, or among males or females born between 1899 and 1946. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a trend for decreased dementia incidence in the EAS cohort, rates of incident aMCI have not changed. These apparently conflicting results may indicate a delay or decrease in the rates of transition from aMCI to dementia within the cohort. However, further studies are needed to confirm whether rates of aMCI have changed in other populations, and how aMCI rates are related to secular trends in dementia risk factors.
