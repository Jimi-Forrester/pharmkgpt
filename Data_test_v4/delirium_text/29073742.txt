29073742|t|Peripheral Signatures of Psychiatric Disorders: MicroRNAs.
29073742|a|MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are 22 nucleotide long RNA transcripts, their synthesis starts in nucleus and continues in cytoplasm. As being critical for post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression they have been investigated in psychiatric disorders. There are numerous studies performed in peripheral tissues for psychiatric disorders. Here in this article, we aimed to review some common miRNAs denoted significant in at least two studies and their relevance to psychiatric research. We focused on miR-320, miR-106, miR-34, miR-223, miR-107, and miR-134.
