34441995|a|The association between malignancy and readmission after Takotsubo syndrome (TTS) hospitalization has not been fully described. We sought to examine the rates, cause, and cost of 30-day readmissions of TTS, with or without malignancy, by utilizing Nationwide Readmissions Databases from 2010 to 2014. We identified 61,588 index hospitalizations for TTS. TTS patients with malignancy tended to be older (70.6 +- 0.2 vs. 66.1 +- 0.1, p < 0.001), and the overall burden of comorbidities was higher than in those without malignancy. TTS patients with malignancy had significantly higher 30-day readmission rates than those without malignancy (15.9% vs. 11.0%; odds ratio (OR), 1.35; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.18-1.56). Non-cardiac causes were the most common causes of readmission for TTS patients with malignancy versus without malignancy (75.5% vs. 68.1%, p < 0.001). The 30-day readmission rate due to recurrent TTS was very low in both groups (0.4% and 0.5%; p = 0.47). The total costs were higher by 25% (p < 0.001) in TTS patients with vs. without malignancy. In summary, among patients hospitalized with TTS, the presence of malignancy was associated with increased risk of 30-day readmission and increased costs. These findings highlight the importance of optimized management for TTS patients with malignancy.
