35776355|t|Three-Dimensional Atlas of the Human Amygdala Subnuclei Constructed Using Immunohistochemical and Ultrahigh-Field Magnetic Resonance Imaging Data.
35776355|a|The amygdala is central for social and emotional processing and has been implicated in various disorders including autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Animal research and some limited research with humans has indicated that widespread alterations in neuronal development or neuronal loss in the basolateral and other amygdala subnuclei may be a contributing factor to variations in social behaviours. Yet, the basolateral amygdala is comprised of three subnuclei, each with a specialized role related to the coordination of emotional regulation. Due to their small size, the nuclei which comprise the basolateral amygdala remain understudied in humans in vivo. In this work, we describe methodology to examine the basolateral amygdala and other subnuclei in human ex vivo medial temporal lobe prosections using ultrahigh-field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 9.4 T. Manual segmentations of the amygdala subnuclei on MR images, verified with immunohistochemical data, provide a robust three-dimensional atlas of the human amygdala. The goal is to apply the atlas to in vivo MRI scans to examine basolateral amygdala macrostructural development attributed to social cognitive dysfunction in ASD and other neurodevelopmental disorders. Furthermore, the atlas can be used to examine MRI-based correlates of neuronal loss commonly seen in neurodegenerative disorders.
