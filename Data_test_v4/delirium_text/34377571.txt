34377571|a|Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a technique of detecting cerebral cortical function by using near-infrared light, which is a multifunctional neuroimaging technique and provides a convenient and efficient detection method in neuroscience. In consideration of acceptability, safety, high spatial and temporal resolutions compared with electroencephalogram (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), fNIRS is widely used to study different psychiatric disorders, most prominently affective disorders, schizophrenic illnesses, brain organic mental disorders and neurodevelopmental disorders, etc. The article focuses on the latest research progress and practical application of fNIRS in psychiatric disorders, especially traumatic brain, including studies on the characterization of phenomenology, treatment effects and descriptions of neuroimaging data.
