26287155|t|Inhibition of Cytosolic Phospholipase A2alpha (cPLA2alpha) by Medicinal Plants in Relation to Their Phenolic Content.
26287155|a|The cytosolic phospholipase A2alpha(cPLA2alpha) is one of the potential targets for anti-inflammatory drugs, since this enzyme plays a key role in the inflammation processes seen in health disorders, like asthma, allergic reactions, arthritis and neuronal diseases. In this study, cPLA2alpha inhibition by 43 methanol extracts from medicinal plants rich in polyphenols was determined. The eight most active extracts were derived from Ribes nigrum (IC50 of 27.7 mug/mL), Ononis spinosa (IC50 of 39.4 mug/mL), Urtica dioica (IC50 of 44.32 mug/mL), Betula sp. (IC50 of 58.02 mug/mL), Sanguisorba officinalis (IC50 of 76.25 mug/mL), Orthosiphon stamineus (IC50 of 78.83 mug/mL), Petasites hybridus (IC50 of 81.02 mug/mL) and Tussilago farfara (IC50 of 123.28 mug/mL). Additionally, the antioxidant activities of these extracts were determined with the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay and their phenolic content with the Folin-Ciocalteu reagent. Antioxidant activity showed a non-linear, positive correlation to the phenolic content, but no correlation of PLA2 inhibition with phenolic content could be established. This study provides evidence that cPLA2alpha may be a relevant target for anti-inflammatory agents.
