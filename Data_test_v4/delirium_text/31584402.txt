31584402|t|AANA Journal Course Clarifying the Confusion of Adult Emergence Delirium.
31584402|a|To date, researchers studying emergence delirium in adults have not adopted a consensus on the terminology for the phenomenon, a formalized definition, a measurement tool or standardized differential diagnosis to distinguish emergence delirium from postoperative delirium, anticholinergic or serotonergic toxicities, and other physiologic issues that may present on emergence from anesthesia. This lack of a consensus in emergence delirium research and differential diagnostic tools is confounding findings and preventing improved patient outcomes. Information from an integrative review of the literature in conjunction with a Delphi study was used to develop a standardized differential of similarly presenting phenomena to assist clinicians in determining appropriate interventions for patients who appear to have emergence delirium.
