35418837|t|Neuroinflammation as the Underlying Mechanism of Postoperative Cognitive Dysfunction and Therapeutic Strategies.
35418837|a|Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a common neurological complication following surgery and general anesthesia, especially in elderly patients. Severe cases delay patient discharge, affect the patient's quality of life after surgery, and are heavy burdens to society. In addition, as the population ages, surgery is increasingly used for older patients and those with higher prevalences of complications. This trend presents a huge challenge to the current healthcare system. Although studies on POCD are ongoing, the underlying pathogenesis is still unclear due to conflicting results and lack of evidence. According to existing studies, the occurrence and development of POCD are related to multiple factors. Among them, the pathogenesis of neuroinflammation in POCD has become a focus of research in recent years, and many clinical and preclinical studies have confirmed the correlation between neuroinflammation and POCD. In this article, we reviewed how central nervous system inflammation occurred, and how it could lead to POCD with changes in peripheral circulation and the pathological pathways between peripheral circulation and the central nervous system (CNS). Furthermore, we proposed some potential therapeutic targets, diagnosis and treatment strategies at the cellular and molecular levels, and clinical applications. The goal of this article was to provide a better perspective for understanding the occurrence of POCD, its development, and preventive strategies to help manage these vulnerable geriatric patients.
