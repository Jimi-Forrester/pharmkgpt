30023606|t|Gram-Scale Synthesis of a beta-Secretase 1 (BACE 1) Inhibitor.
30023606|a|Development of a scalable synthesis of an oxazine class of beta-secretase inhibitor is described. Trifluoromethylated acyloin synthesis by the reaction of a mandelic acid with trifluoroacetic anhydride in the presence of pyridine (Dakin-West reaction) was used as an efficient strategy to install the key trifluoromethyl substituent on the oxazine ring. Diastereoselective addition of methyl magnesium bromide to a cyclic sulfamidate imine and trimethylsilyl trifluoromethanesulfonate catalyzed intramolecular amidine formation to yield oxazine-3-amine are some of the significant, novel synthetic methods developed in this synthesis. These critical transformations allowed a concise 11-step route to the target compound with excellent overall yields.
