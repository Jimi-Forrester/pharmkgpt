27651501|t|BET 1: Screening for delirium within the emergency department.
27651501|a|A shortcut review was carried out to see if the abbreviated mental test score was better than other cognitive screening tools to diagnose delirium in the ED. Fourteen papers were identified reporting on 10 separate ED studies. Only one small study used the abbreviated mental test score and did not compare the diagnostic performance to any other test. There is very little published research on the use of the abbreviated mental test score in the ED setting.
