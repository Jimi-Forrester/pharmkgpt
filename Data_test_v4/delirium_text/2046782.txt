2046782|t|[The course of Alzheimer's disease in a group of nursing home patients: epidemiology, (co)morbidity and mortality].
2046782|a|One hundred medical charts of patients of a psychogeriatric nursing home with 'possible' (senile) dementia of the Alzheimer type were reviewed. Eighty-seven patients had died and 13 were alive at the time of analysis. The aim of the study was to obtain epidemiological information and to investigate (co)morbidity and mortality of these patients. All the data of this group of nursing home patients appeared to have a wide range. The process of dementia started at a mean age of about 75 years and patients remained in their homes for more than five years before admission. The average time spent in the nursing home was 3.0 years. These patients had a shorter life expectancy, counted from the time of admission, compared with the Dutch population. At admission a large percentage of patients suffered from circulatory system disease, musculoskeletal and connective tissue disease and/or sensory deprivation. During the stay the most frequent diseases were urinary and respiratory tract infections, constipation and chronic ulcers of the skin. Symptoms specific of Alzheimer's disease also occurred: feeding problems, disorders of gait and neurological symptoms such as paratonia. A large percentage of patients showed adverse effects of drugs or suffered from the consequences of trauma. Patients died of cachexia or bronchopneumonia. It is unclear whether the population studied is representative of the total population of Alzheimer patients.
