2534160|t|Vitamin E concentrations in human brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease, fetuses with Down's syndrome, centenarians, and controls.
2534160|a|The concentration of vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) was measured in samples of cortex from patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), fetuses with Down's syndrome (DS), and also in a group of centenarians. The mean tocopherol concentrations in the two patient groups did not differ significantly from appropriate controls. When expressed per lipid the mean tocopherol concentration of the centenarians was greater than that of the controls but this reflected a significant decrease in the lipid concentration of the former group. These results indicate that neither the normal aging processes, Alzheimer's disease, nor the increased in vitro lipid peroxidation reported in fetuses with Down's syndrome result from a gross lack of alpha-tocopherol, or cause a significant depletion of the vitamin.
