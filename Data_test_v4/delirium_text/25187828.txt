25187828|a|It remains unclear whether mild hypothermia affects energy metabolism in the brain tissue of newborns with hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE). The current study aimed to investigate the effect of mild hypothermia on energy metabolism in neonatal HIE and assess brain energy metabolism using position emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scanning. The mean standardised uptake values of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) were used to determine the glucose metabolic rate in various brain anatomical regions, including the thalamus, basal ganglia and the frontal, parietal and occipital lobes. The rate of glucose metabolism significantly improved following treatment with mild hypothermia therapy and conventional therapy (P<0.001). Prior to the treatment, no significant differences were identified between the groups (P>0.05). Following treatment, the rate of glucose metabolism was significantly improved in the mild hypothermia therapy group compared with that in the conventional therapy group (P<0.001). Thus, these results indicate that mild hypothermia therapy effectively promotes the recovery of patients with neonatal HIE. 18F-FDG PET/CT scanning may be used to provide reference values for the assessment of energetic metabolism in patients with neonatal HIE.
