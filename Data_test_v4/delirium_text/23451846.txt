23451846|a|There is increasing recognition of the deleterious effects of poor nutrition on health care outcomes. Older patients appear particularly vulnerable to the effects of undernutrition. This includes both low intake as patients and chronic preadmission undernutrition. This study investigates nutrition during a critical intervening period when patients present to a hospital emergency department (ED) in the first half of the day. One third of observed patients sustained periadmission fasts in excess of 18 hours. This fasting period showed significant positive correlation to age (correlation coefficient = 0.34, P < 0.05). Analysis of the results by gender showed that men who were older than the average cohort age of 53.6 years fasted for a significantly longer period in the hospital than their younger counterparts (P < 0.02). This comparison did not reach significant levels for female patients (P > 0.05). This study raises the question as to whether food should be routinely provided in the ED unless there is reason to withhold it. Particular care should be taken to avoid unnecessary delays in offering food to older patients. There may also be a need to ensure that geriatric care indicators are considered individually for each gender.
