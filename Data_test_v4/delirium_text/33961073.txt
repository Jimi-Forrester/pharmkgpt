33961073|t|Derivation and validation of actionable quality indicators targeting reductions in complications for injury admissions.
33961073|a|PURPOSE: Approximately, one out of five patients hospitalized following injury will develop at least one hospital complication, more than three times that observed for general admissions. We currently lack actionable Quality Indicators (QI) targeting specific complications in this population. We aimed to derive and validate QI targeting hospital complications for injury admissions and develop algorithms to identify patient charts to review. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study including patients with major trauma admitted to any level I or II adult trauma center an integrated Canadian trauma system (2014-2019). We used the trauma registry to develop five QI targeting deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism (DVT/PE), decubitus ulcers, delirium, pneumonia and urinary tract infection (UTI). We developed algorithms to identify patient charts to revise on consultation with a group of clinical experts. RESULTS: The study population included 14,592 patients of whom 5.3% developed DVT or PE, 2.7% developed a decubitus ulcer, 8.6% developed delirium, 14.7% developed pneumonia and 7.3% developed UTI. The indicators demonstrated excellent predictive performance (Area Under the Curve 0.81-0.87). We identified 4 hospitals with a higher than average incidence of at least one of the targeted complications. The algorithms identified on average 50 and 20 charts to be reviewed per year for level I and II centers, respectively. CONCLUSION: In line with initiatives to improve the quality of trauma care, we propose QI targeting reductions in hospital complications for injury admissions and algorithms to generate case lists to facilitate the review of patient charts.
