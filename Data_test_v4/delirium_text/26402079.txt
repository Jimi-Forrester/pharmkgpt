26402079|a|BACKGROUND: omega3 fatty acids (omega3 FAs) may slow the rate of decline in cognitive performance in mild forms of cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the relationship between changes of plasma omega3 FA levels and cognitive performance, as well as effects of gender, are poorly known. OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of 6-month administration of DHA-rich omega3 FA supplementation on plasma FA profiles in patients with mild to moderate AD in relation to cognitive performance and gender. This investigation is part of the OmegAD Study. METHODS: 174 AD patients (74 +- 9 years) were randomized to a daily intake of 2.3 g omega3 FA or placebo for 6 months; subsequently all received the omega3 FA preparation for the next 6 months. Baseline as well as changes in plasma levels of the main omega3 FAs in 165 patients, while receiving omega3 FA supplementation for 6 months, were analyzed for association to cognitive performance (assessed by ADAS-cog and MMSE scores) as well as to gender. RESULTS: Preservation of cognitive functioning, assessed by ADAS-cog or its sub-items (but not MMSE) scores, was significantly associated to increasing plasma omega3 FA levels over time. Thus, the higher omega3 FA plasma levels rose, the lower was the rate of cognitive deterioration. This effect was not related to gender; since although females displayed higher omega3 FA plasma levels than did males after 6 months of supplementation, this difference disappeared when adjusted for body weight. CONCLUSIONS: Since our study suggests dose-response relationships between plasma levels of omega3 FA and preservation of cognition, future omega3 FA trials in patients with mild AD should consider exploring graded (and body weight adjusted) doses of omega3 FA.
