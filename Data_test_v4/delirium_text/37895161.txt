37895161|t|Mechanistic Intimate Insights into the Role of Hydrogen Sulfide in Alzheimer's Disease: A Recent Systematic Review.
37895161|a|In the rapidly evolving field of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) research, the intricate role of Hydrogen Sulfide (H2S) has garnered critical attention for its diverse involvement in both pathological substrates and prospective therapeutic paradigms. While conventional pathophysiological models of AD have primarily emphasized the significance of amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposition and tau protein hyperphosphorylation, this targeted systematic review meticulously aggregates and rigorously appraises seminal contributions from the past year elucidating the complex mechanisms of H2S in AD pathogenesis. Current scholarly literature accentuates H2S's dual role, delineating its regulatory functions in critical cellular processes-such as neurotransmission, inflammation, and oxidative stress homeostasis-while concurrently highlighting its disruptive impact on quintessential AD biomarkers. Moreover, this review illuminates the nuanced mechanistic intimate interactions of H2S in cerebrovascular and cardiovascular pathology associated with AD, thereby exploring avant-garde therapeutic modalities, including sulfurous mineral water inhalations and mud therapy. By emphasizing the potential for therapeutic modulation of H2S via both donors and inhibitors, this review accentuates the imperative for future research endeavors to deepen our understanding, thereby potentially advancing novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in AD.
