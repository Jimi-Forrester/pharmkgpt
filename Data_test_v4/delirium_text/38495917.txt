38495917|t|Adjuvant Vitamin D Injection in Elderly Patients Before Intertrochanteric Fracture Surgery: A Randomised Controlled Trial.
38495917|a|Background: There are multiple recommended protocols for Vitamin D (VitD) supplementation in elderly; however, only a few studies achieved to examine the role of VitD supplements before intertrochanteric fracture surgery on mortality and complications after surgery. Methods: This single-center block-randomized double-blinded trial was conducted on 80 patients with intertrochanteric fractures and a sufficient level of 25 (OH) VitD. The intervention group received an intramuscular 300,000 IU VitD ampule before surgery. The primary outcome was a 6-month mortality rate, and the secondary outcomes were 1- and 2-year mortality rates and Harris Hip Score (HHS) in 6, 12, and 24 months after surgery. Chi-square, t-test, repeated measure ANOVA, and Cox regression survival model was used for statistical analysis. Results: 40 patients were allocated to each group. Demographic, clinical characteristics, and preoperative evaluations were not significantly different between the groups. Mortality rate 6-month after the surgery was 7.5% and 10% for the intervention and placebo groups respectively (P value = .71), 15% and 12.5% at 1-year (P value = .83), and 25% and 27.5% at 2-year (P value = .98). Based on the Cox regression model, only age was significantly associated with mortality (HR = 1.229, P value <.001). Significant HHS changes from baseline through 24 months after surgery were observed within both groups; however, mean differences were not significantly different between groups. Conclusions: A single preoperative 300,000 IU VitD did not significantly impact 2-year survival and HHS in patients with intertrochanteric fractures and sufficient serum VitD level.
