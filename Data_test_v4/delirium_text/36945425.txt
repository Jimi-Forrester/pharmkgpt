36945425|t|Cortical thickness of the inferior parietal lobule as a potential predictor of relapse in men with alcohol dependence.
36945425|a|Background Alcohol dependence (AD) is a disorder with a high recurrence rate that leads to a considerable public health burden. The risk of relapse appears to be related to a complex interplay of multiple factors. Herein, we aimed to explore the potential neural predictors of relapse in Chinese male patients with AD. Methods This study enrolled 58 male patients with AD who had undergone acute detoxification. General demographic information and clinical features were collected. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data were used to measure cortical thickness across 34 regions of the brain. Patients were followed up at 6 months, and 51 patients completed the follow-up visit. These patients were divided into a relapser and an abstainer group. A binary logistic regression analysis was performed to investigate the potential risk factors of relapse. Results Compared to abstainers, relapsers showed higher inattention and non-planning impulsivity on the 11th version of the Barratt Impulsive Scale. The cortical thicknesses of the inferior-parietal lobule were significantly greater in abstainers compared with those in relapsers. Furthermore, binary logistic regression analysis showed that the thickness of the inferior parietal lobule predicted relapse. Conclusions Relapsers show poorer impulse control than abstainers, and MRI imaging shows a decreased thickness of the inferior parietal lobule in relapsers. Our results indicate the thickness of the inferior parietal lobule as a potential relapse predictor in male patients with AD.
