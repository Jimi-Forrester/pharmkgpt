39639910|a|Introduction: Apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon 4 is regarded as the most significant genetic contributor linked to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Daily life elements might also influence cognitive abilities to some extent. This research aimed to investigate whether carrying APOE epsilon4 alters the effects of lifestyle on cognitive ability. Methods: The research included 1871 senior community members with APOE gene data, all participating in clinical, neuropsychological, and daily living factor assessments. Based on their APOE epsilon4 status, they were categorized into two groups: the APOE epsilon4 group (n = 362) and the non-APOE epsilon4 group (n = 1,509). Subsequently, a multivariate logistic regression analysis was employed to investigate the link between cognitive deficits and APOE epsilon4, along with lifestyle patterns. Results: Our research revealed a reduced incidence of MCI (OR = 0.745, 95% CI: 0.587-0.945, p = 0.015) and dementia (OR = 0.422, 95% CI: 0.259-0.688, p = 0.001) in the non-APOE epsilon4 carriers. Furthermore, the general linear regression analysis revealed a notable interplay between APOE epsilon4 and sleep disturbances, potentially impacting cognitive deterioration together (F = 6.817, p = 0.001). Conclusions: The research indicates that possessing APOE epsilon4 alters the impact of everyday life factors on cognitive decline. In addition, there is a significant interaction between APOE epsilon4 and sleep disorders, which may jointly lead to the appearance of cognitive impairment.
