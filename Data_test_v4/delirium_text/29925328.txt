29925328|a|BACKGROUND: Short acting inhalational anesthetic (Desflurane) produces emergence agitation (EA) in pediatrics with an incidence up to 80%. The aim of the present study was to examine the role of Gabapentin oral solution in attenuating desflurane associated EA in children after strabismus surgery under general anesthesia. METHODS: Seventy patients, 2-6 years old, scheduled for strabismus surgery were randomly allocated into two groups (35 each); Control group (c): received 5 ml of oral strawberry juice (placebo) and Gabapentin group (G) received 5 mg/Kg gabapentin oral solution in 5 ml strawberry juice, 1 h before anesthesia. Patient separation, cooperation, emergence incidence and emergence severity were assessed. Also time to extubation and time to emergence, duration of PACU stay, PONV and number of patients required meperidine postoperatively were recorded. RESULTS: Duration to extubation and duration to emergence were statistically prolonged in gabapentin group compared to the control group. The incidence of EA and its severity were reduced in gabapentin group with more tendencies to be asleep and less attentive. More patients in the control group required postoperative meperidine to reduce crying and agitation. CONCLUSION: Oral gabapentin 5 mg/kg reduced the incidence and severity scoring of emergence agitation (by 20%) with more tendencies for sleeping with preserved response to stimuli in PACU. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Number: NCT03347916 , date: November 17, 2017, retrospectively.
