33282113|a|Acute lung injury (ALI) is an acute hypoxic respiratory insufficiency caused by various intra- and extrapulmonary injury factors. Presently, excessive inflammation in the lung and the apoptosis of alveolar epithelial cells are considered to be the key factors in the pathogenesis of ALI. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) is an oxygen-dependent conversion activator that is closely related to the activity of reactive oxygen species (ROS). HIF-1 has been shown to play an important role in ALI and can be used as a potential therapeutic target for ALI. This manuscript will introduce the progress of HIF-1 in ALI and explore the feasibility of applying inhibitors of HIF-1 to ALI, which brings hope for the treatment of ALI.
