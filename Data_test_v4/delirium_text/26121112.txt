26121112|a|Human herpesvirus 6B (HHV-6B) frequently reactivates after cord blood transplantation (CBT). We previously reported an association between HHV-6B reactivation and delirium after hematopoietic cell transplantation. In this prospective study, 35 CBT recipients underwent twice-weekly plasma PCR testing for HHV-6 and thrice-weekly delirium assessment until day 84. There was a quantitative association between HHV-6B reactivation and delirium in univariable (odds ratio, 2.88; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.97-8.59) and bivariable models. In addition, intensified prophylaxis with high-dose valacyclovir mitigated HHV-6B reactivation (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.14-1.08). Larger trials are needed to explore the utility of HHV-6B prophylaxis after CBT.
