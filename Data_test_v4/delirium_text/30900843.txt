METHODS: Urine samples were collected from 13 APP/PS1 mice of 16 weeks and 15 wild-type mice. 1H-NMR spectroscopy was acquired with a one-dimensional NOESY pulse sequence, and the integral values were imported to SIMCA-P+12.0 software for analysis. RESULTS: The metabonomic analysis showed that the metabolic profiles of the APP/PS1 mice were significantly different from that of age-matched wild-type mice. The levels of 3-hydroxybutyrate, 2-hydroxybutyrate, succinic acid, 2-ketoglutaric acid, citric acid, cis-aconitic acid, fumaric acid decreased, and those of acetic acid, trimethylamine, taurine, creatinine, hippuric acid, formic acid, trigonelline, urea increased (all P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Metabolic pathways including glucose metabolism and methylamine metabolism may be involved in the pathogenesis of early AD.
