29426770|t|Diastereoselective synthesis of fused cyclopropyl-3-amino-2,4-oxazine beta-amyloid cleaving enzyme (BACE) inhibitors and their biological evaluation.
29426770|a|The diastereoselective synthesis and structure activity relationship (SAR) of a series of fused cyclopropyl-3-amino-2,4-oxazine (2-oxa-4-azabicyclo[4.1.0]hept-3-en-3-amine)-containing BACE inhibitors is described. Through these efforts compound 2 was identified as a potent (cell IC50 = 15 nM) BACE inhibitor with acceptable ADME properties. When tested in vivo, compound 2 demonstrated a significant reduction of brain and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) Abeta40 levels (46% and 66%, respectively) in a rat pharmacodynamic study and thus represents a suitable starting point for the further development of in vivo efficacious compounds for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
