34380876|t|The short form of the SUR1 and its functional implications in the damaged brain.
34380876|a|Sulfonylurea receptor (SUR) belongs to the adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family; however, SUR is associated with ion channels and acts as a regulatory subunit determining the opening or closing of the pore. Abcc8 and Abcc9 genes code for the proteins SUR1 and SUR2, respectively. The SUR1 transcript encodes a protein of 1582 amino acids with a mass around 140-177 kDa expressed in the pancreas, brain, heart, and other tissues. It is well known that SUR1 assembles with Kir6.2 and TRPM4 to establish KATP channels and non-selective cation channels, respectively. Abbc8 and 9 are alternatively spliced, and the resulting transcripts encode different isoforms of SUR1 and SUR2, which have been detected by different experimental strategies. Interestingly, the use of binding assays to sulfonylureas and Western blotting has allowed the detection of shorter forms of SUR (~65 kDa). Identity of the SUR1 variants has not been clarified, and some authors have suggested that the shorter forms are unspecific. However, immunoprecipitation assays have shown that SUR2 short forms are part of a functional channel even coexisting with the typical forms of the receptor in the heart. This evidence confirms that the structure of the short forms of the SURs is fully functional and does not lose the ability to interact with the channels. Since structural changes in short forms of SUR modify its affinity to ATP, regulation of its expression might represent an advantage in pathologies where ATP concentrations decrease and a therapeutic target to induce neuroprotection. Remarkably, the expression of SUR1 variants might be induced by conditions associated to the decrease of energetic substrates in the brain (e.g. during stroke and epilepsy). In this review, we want to contribute to the knowledge of SUR1 complexity by analyzing evidence that shows the existence of short SUR1 variants and its possible implications in brain function.
