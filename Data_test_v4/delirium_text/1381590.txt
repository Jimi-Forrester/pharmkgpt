1381590|t|CSF monoamine metabolites in old age dementias.
1381590|a|Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) levels of the main metabolites of monoamines (MHPG, 5-HIAA, and HVA) were measured in patients with early onset (AD) and late-onset (SDAT) Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia (VD), and elderly controls. Psychobehavioral assessment was carried out by means of MMSE and GBS. Mean MHPG levels did not differ from controls; 5-HIAA was lower in VD when compared to both controls and SDAT. HVA was decreased in AD, SDAT, and VD with respect to controls. Significant correlations between HVA and psycho-behavioral parameters were observed in SDAT and VD groups, whereas no relationship was documented in AD. The SDAT group was divided in SDAT-A (age at onset: greater than 65 less than or equal to 80 yr) and SDAT-B (age at onset: greater than 80 yr). SDAT-A had significantly lower CSF HVA values than SDAT-B (165 +/- 64 vs 235.7 +/- 85). SDAT-B HVA levels were similar to those observed in controls. Correlation analysis between HVA and neuropsychological variables was significant in SDAT-A, but not in SDAT-B. These results might support the evidence of SDAT heterogeneity.
