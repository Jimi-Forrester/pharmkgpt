34709141|a|INTRODUCTION: Although subjective cognitive decline (SCD) may be an early risk marker of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), research on SCD among Hispanics/Latinos/as/x (henceforth Latinos/as) living in the U.S. is lacking. We investigated if the cross-sectional relationship of self-reported SCD with objective cognition varies as a function of ethnic background (Latinos/as versus Non-Hispanic Whites [NHWs]). Secondary analyses conducted solely within the Latino/a group investigated if informant reported SCD is associated with objective cognition and whether self-reported SCD is related to markers of brain health in a sub-sample of Latinos/as with available MRI data. METHODS: Eighty-three participants (>=60 years of age) without dementia (35 Latinos/as; 48 NHWs) completed the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (MDRS) and the Subjective Cognitive Decline-Questionnaire (SCD-Q). Additionally, 22 Latino/a informants completed the informant-version of the SCD-Q. Hierarchical regression models investigated if ethnicity moderates the association of MDRS and SCD-Q scores after adjusting for demographics and depressive symptoms. Correlational analyses within the Latino/a group investigated self- and informant-reported associations of SCD-Q scores with objective cognition, and associations of self-reported SCD-Q scores with medial temporal lobe volume and thickness. RESULTS: Latinos/as had lower education and MDRS scores than NHWs. Higher SCD-Q scores were associated with lower MDRS scores only in Latinos/as. Within the Latino/a group, self, but not informant reported SCD was related to objective cognition. Medium to large effect sizes were found whereby higher self-reported SCD was associated with lower entorhinal cortex thickness and left hippocampal volume in Latinos/as. CONCLUSIONS: The association of SCD and concurrent objectively measured global cognition varied by ethnic background and was only significant in Latinos/as. Self-reported SCD may be an indicator of cognitive and brain health in Latinos/as without dementia, prompting clinicians to monitor cognition. Future studies should explore if SCD predicts objective cognitive decline in diverse groups of Latinos/as living in the U.S.
