20151010|a|Rhabdomyolysis and myoglobinuria are a rare complication of dermatomyositis. Such patient can land up in acute renal failure. Recognition of this fact has important therapeutic implications as patients require immunotherapy in addition to the symptomatic treatment for renal failure. We report a case of dermatomyositis with evidence of rhabdomyolysis and myoglobinuria presenting with acute renal failure. The patient responded dramatically to corticosteroid therapy.
