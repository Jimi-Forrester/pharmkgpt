37728789|a|Human brain is characterized by extremely sparse extracellular matrix (ECM). Despite its low abundance, the significance of brain ECM in both physiological and pathological conditions should not be underestimated. Brain metastasis is a serious complication of cancer, and recent findings highlighted the contribution of ECM in brain metastasis development. In this review, we provide a comprehensive outlook on how ECM proteins promote brain metastasis seeding. In particular, we discuss (1) disruption of the blood-brain barrier in brain metastasis; (2) role of ECM in modulating brain metastasis dormancy; (3) regulation of brain metastasis seeding by ECM-activated integrin signaling; (4) functions of brain-specific ECM protein reelin in brain metastasis. Lastly, we consider the possibility of targeting ECM for brain metastasis management.
