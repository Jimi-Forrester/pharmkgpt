38108952|t|Relationship of Sleep Disorder with Neurodegenerative and Psychiatric Diseases: An Updated Review.
38108952|a|Sleep disorders affect many people worldwide and can accompany neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases. Sleep may be altered before the clinical manifestations of some of these diseases appear. Moreover, some sleep disorders affect the physiological organization and function of the brain by influencing gene expression, accelerating the accumulation of abnormal proteins, interfering with the clearance of abnormal proteins, or altering the levels of related hormones and neurotransmitters, which can cause or may be associated with the development of neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases. However, the detailed mechanisms of these effects are unclear. This review mainly focuses on the relationship between and mechanisms of action of sleep in Alzheimer's disease, depression, and anxiety, as well as the relationships between sleep and Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. This summary of current research hotspots may provide researchers with better clues and ideas to develop treatment solutions for neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases associated with sleep disorders.
