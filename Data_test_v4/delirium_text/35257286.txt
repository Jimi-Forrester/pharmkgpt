35257286|a|The blood-brain barrier (BBB) has a major protective function in preventing the entry of harmful molecules into the brain, but is simultaneously limiting the delivery of drugs, restricting their potential clinical application in neurodegenerative diseases. Recent preclinical evidence demonstrates that following application of focused ultrasound with microbubbles (FUS+MB), the BBB becomes reversibly accessible to compounds that normally are brain-impermeable, suggesting FUS+MB as a promising new platform for delivery of therapeutic agents into the central nervous system. As a step towards translation, small cohort clinical studies were performed demonstrating safe BBB opening in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients following FUS+MB, however improved drug delivery has not yet been achieved in human. Simultaneously, rapid progress in the human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) modeling technology allowed for development of novel Alzheimer's disease patient-derived BBB in vitro model that reacts to FUS+MB with BBB opening and can be used to answer fundamental questions of human BBB responses to FUS+MB in health and disease. This review summarizes key features of the BBB that contribute to limited drug delivery, recapitulates recent advances in the FUS+MB mediated human BBB opening in vivo and in vitro in the context of neurodegenerative disorders, and highlights potential strategies for fast-track translation of the FUS+MB to improve bioavailability of drugs to the human brain. With safe and effective application, this innovative FUS+MB technology may open new avenues for therapeutic interventions in neurodegenerative diseases leading to improved clinical outcomes for patients.
