33215136|a|AIMS: This study aimed to identify patients receiving total hip arthroplasty (THA) for trauma during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK and quantify the risks of contracting SARS-CoV-2 virus, the proportion of patients requiring treatment in an intensive care unit (ICU), and rate of complications including mortality. METHODS: All patients receiving a primary THA for trauma in four regional hospitals were identified for analysis during the period 1 March to 1 June 2020, which covered the current peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK. RESULTS: Overall, one of 48 patients (2%) contracted COVID-19 during their admission. Although they required a protracted stay in hospital, they did not require ICU treatment. Two patients did require ICU support for medical problems but not relating to COVID-19. Complications were no greater than expected given the short follow-up. There were no mortalities. CONCLUSION: There is a paucity of evidence to guide restarting elective joint arthroplasties following the COVID-19 pandemic. Although THAs for trauma are by no means a perfect surrogate, the results of this study show a low incidence of contracting COVID-19 virus during admission and no significant sequalae during this period.Cite this article: Bone Joint Open 2020;1-7:438-442.
