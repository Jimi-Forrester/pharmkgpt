36050507|t|Lycopene: a therapeutic strategy against coronavirus disease 19 (COVID- 19).
36050507|a|Lycopene is a group of phytochemicals found in nature, primarily in fruits and vegetables. Lycopene is thought to protect against a variety of diseases attributed to its antioxidant capabilities. Lycopene has anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, and immunity-boosting qualities, among other biological and pharmacological benefits. COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 19) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which has recently emerged as one of the world's leading causes of death. Patients may be asymptomatic or show signs of respiratory, cytokine release syndrome, gastrointestinal, or even multiple organ failure, all of which can lead to death. In COVID-19, inflammation, and cytokine storm are the key pathogenic mechanisms, according to SARS-CoV-2 infection symptoms. ARDS develops in some vulnerable hosts, which is accompanied by an inflammatory "cytokine syndrome" that causes lung damage. Immunological and inflammatory markers were linked to disease severity in mild and severe COVID-19 cases, implying that inflammatory markers, including IL-6, CRP, ESR, and PCT were significantly linked with COVID-19 severity. Patients with severe illness have reduced levels of several immune subsets, including CD4 + T, NK, and CD8 + cells. As a result, lycopene can be commended for bolstering physiological defenses against COVID-19 infections.
