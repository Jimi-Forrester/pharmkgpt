38818170|a|Background: Postoperative delirium (POD) often occurs in elderly patients after surgery. We conducted two clinical studies to determine whether COVID-19 vaccination has a protective effect on POD and to explore the role of CSF biomarkers in this process. Methods: We conducted two clinical studies, Perioperative Neurocognitive Disorder Risk Factor and Prognosis (PNDRFAP) and Perioperative Neurocognitive Disorder and Biomarker Lifestyle (PNDABLE), in which patients more than or equal to 65 years old who have had elective non-cardiac surgery were enrolled. The preoperative cognitive status of patients were evaluated by Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) one day preoperatively. Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) was used to diagnose POD. We used the mediation model to analyze the relationship between CSF biomarkers, COVID-19 vaccination and POD, as well as Dynamic Nomogram to calculate the incidence of Non-Postoperative Delirium (NPOD). The main outcome of these studies was the incidence of POD during seven days postoperatively or before discharge, which was assessed by CAM. Results: In the final, 705 participants were enrolled in the PNDRFAP study, and 638 patients in the PNDABLE. In both studies, we found that the occurrence of POD was lower in patients who had injected COVID-19 vaccination before surgery compared with those without vaccination (PNDRFAP: 10.20 % [21/205] vs 25.80 % [129/500], P < 0.001; PNDABLE: 2.40 % [4/164] vs 34.60 % [164/474], P < 0.001). Mediation analysis showed that the protective effect of preoperative COVID-19 vaccine on POD was significantly mediated by CSF Abeta42 (proportion = 17.56 %), T-tau (proportion = 19.64 %), Abeta42/T-tau (proportion = 29.67 %), and Abeta42/P-tau (proportion = 12.26 %). Conclusions: COVID-19 vaccine is a protective factor for POD in old patients, which is associated with CSF biomarkers.
