37323852|a|The development of novel therapeutics for rare "orphan" diseases has brought a growing tension between the desire to accelerate access to these breakthrough therapies and the need to generate quality evidence regarding their safety and efficacy. Accelerating the pace of drug development and approval may facilitate the rapid delivery of benefits to patients and cost savings for research and development, which theoretically improves affordability of drugs for the health system. However, several ethical challenges arise with expedited approval, compassionate release of drugs, and subsequent study of drugs in "real-world" settings. In this article, we explore the changing landscape of drug approval and the ethical challenges expedited approval creates for patients, caregivers, clinicians, and institutions, and propose tangible strategies to maximize the benefits of "real-world" data acquisition while mitigating risks to patients, clinicians, and institutions.
