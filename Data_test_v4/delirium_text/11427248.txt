11427248|a|The referral pattern of neurological patients to 33 European psychiatric consultation-liaison (C-L) services in the general hospital was examined. Analyses were conducted on the ECLW CS data set, which consists of 14,717 psychiatric C-L referrals made in 56 European hospitals during 1991. Psychiatric referrals of patients admitted to neurological wards were compared to referrals from other wards. Information was obtained from 33 neurological wards, consisting of 34,506 neurological admissions. Of these admissions, 839 were referred to C-L psychiatry. The median consult rate among the hospitals was 1.8%. Compared to other hospital wards, patients referred from neurology were more frequently diagnosed as suffering from somatoform (P<.01) and dissociative disorders (P<.01), and less from substance abuse (P<.01) and delirium (P<.01). Referral to C-L psychiatry from neurological wards is characterized by an underestimation of psychiatric co-morbidity and a late detection, comparable to other medical specialties. An appeal is made for a standardized referral procedure including admission screening method, detecting patients at risk for nonstandard care during their hospital admission.
