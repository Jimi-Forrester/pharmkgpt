35779795|a|Amyloid beta (Abeta) plaques formation and impaired neurotransmission and neuronal behaviors are primary hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) that are further associated with impaired glucose metabolism in elderly AD's patients. However, the exact role of glucose metabolism on disease progression has not been elucidated yet. In this study, the effect of glucose on Abeta-mediated toxicity, neurotransmission and neuronal behaviors has been investigated using a C. elegans model system expressing human Abeta. In addition to regular diet, worms expressing Abeta were supplemented with different concentrations of glucose and glycerol and 5 mM 2-deoxyglucose to draw any conclusions. Addition of glucose to the growth medium delayed Abeta-associated paralysis, promoted abnormal body shapes and movement, unable to restore impaired acetylcholine neurotransmission, inhibited egg laying and hatching in pre-existing Abeta-mediated pathology. The harmful effects of glucose may associate with an increase in toxic Abeta oligomers and impaired neurotransmission. O-beta-GlcNAcylation (O-GlcNAc), a well-known post-translational modification is directly associated with glucose metabolism and has been found to ameliorates the Abeta- toxicity. We reasoned that glucose addition might induce O-GlcNAc, thereby protect against Abeta. Contrary to our expectations, induced glucose levels were not protective. Increasing O-GlcNAc, either with Thiamet-G (TMG) or by suppressing the O-GlcNAcase (oga-1) gene does interfere with and, therefore, reduce Abeta- toxicity but not in the presence of high glucose. The effects of glucose cannot be effectively managed by manipulating O-GlcNAc in AD models of C. elegans. Our observations suggest that glucose enrichment is unlikely to be an appropriate therapy to minimize AD progression.
