30622276|a|The extension of the amyloid hypothesis to include non-protein metabolite assemblies invokes a paradigm for the pathology of inborn error of metabolism disorders. However, a direct demonstration of the assembly of metabolite amyloid-like structures has so far been provided only in vitro. Here, we established an in vivo model of adenine self-assembly in yeast, in which toxicity is associated with intracellular accumulation of the metabolite. Using a strain blocked in the enzymatic pathway downstream to adenine, we observed a non-linear dose-dependent growth inhibition. Both the staining with an indicative amyloid dye and anti-adenine assemblies antibodies demonstrated the accumulation of adenine amyloid-like structures, which were eliminated by lowering the supplied adenine levels. Treatment with a polyphenol inhibitor reduced the occurrence of amyloid-like structures while not affecting the dramatic increase in intracellular adenine concentration, resulting in inhibition of cytotoxicity, further supporting the notion that toxicity is triggered by adenine assemblies.
