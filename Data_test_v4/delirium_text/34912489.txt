34912489|a|BACKGROUND: The rate of urinary tract infection (UTI) investigation and treatment in confused older emergency department (ED) patients has not been described in the literature. We aim to describe the pattern of practice in an academic tertiary care ED for this common presentation. METHODS: A health record review was conducted on 499 adults aged >=65 presenting to academic EDs with confusion. Exclusion criteria: Glasgow Coma Scale < 13, current treatment for UTI, indwelling catheters, nephrostomy tubes, transfer from another hospital. Outcomes were the prevalence of UTI investigation, diagnosis and antibiotic treatment. RESULTS: 64.9% received urine tests, 11.4% were diagnosed with UTI, and 35.2% were prescribed antibiotics. In the subgroup with no urinary symptoms, fever, or other obvious indication for antibiotics, these numbers were 58.2%, 7.6%, and 18.1%, respectively. Patients who had urine tests or received antibiotics were older than those who did not (p values < .01). Patients receiving antibiotics had higher admission rates and 30-day and six-month mortality (OR of 2.9 [2.0-4.3], 4.0 [1.6-11], and 2.8 [1.4-5.8], respectively). CONCLUSION: Older patients presenting to ED with confusion were frequently investigated and treated for UTI, even in the absence of urinary symptoms. Antibiotic treatment was associated with higher hospitalization and mortality.
