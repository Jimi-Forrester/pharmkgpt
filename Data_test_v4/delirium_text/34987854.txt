34987854|t|Treating COVID-19 in the nursing home setting: an integrated approach for a complex and susceptible cohort.
34987854|a|Our patient, a nursing home resident, was reviewed by our frailty outreach service in November 2020. She initially was diagnosed with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in September 2020 during an outbreak in her nursing home. On this occasion, she again tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Our case report describes the resident's poor immune response indicated by a low IgG level after her initial COVID infection as well as reinfection with a 'non-variant' SARS-CoV-2 lineage (B.1.177). The case describes the importance of integration of community and secondary care. The nursing home received close monitoring and nurse supervision for the detection of potential deterioration of the patient. Exit-seeking behaviour by nursing home residents was limited effectively. The issues of low immune response to COVID-19 in older people and the emergence of variants of concern will continue to pose a threat to this susceptible group.
