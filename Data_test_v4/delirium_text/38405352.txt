38405352|t|Culture-Fair Cognitive Screening Tools for Assessment of Cognitive Impairment: A Systematic Review.
38405352|a|Background: Cognitive screening tools are important in the detection of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease; however, they may contain cultural biases. Objective: This review examines culture-fair cognitive screening tools and evaluates their screening accuracy, strengths, and limitations. Methods: Medline, Embase, PsychINFO and CINAHL were searched. The protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42021288776). Included studies used a culture-fair tool to assess cognition in older adults from varying ethnicities. Narrative synthesis was conducted. Results: 28 studies were included assessing eleven different tools. The Rowland Universal Dementia Assessment Scale (RUDAS) was as accurate as the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) (AUC 0.62-0.93), with a similar sensitivity (52-94%) and better specificity (70-98%), and the Multicultural Cognitive Examination (MCE) had improved screening accuracy (AUC 0.99) compared to RUDAS (AUC 0.92). The Visual Cognitive Assessment Test (VCAT) was equivalent to MMSE (AUC 0.84-0.91). The Kimberley Indigenous Cognitive Assessment tool (KICA) had AUC of 0.93-0.95; sensitivity of 90.6%, specificity 92.6%. Conclusions: The RUDAS, KICA and VCAT were superior to MMSE for screening dementia in ethnic minorities. Other tools also showed good screening accuracy. Further research should be done to validate tools in different populations.
