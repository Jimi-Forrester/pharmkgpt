27099827|t|Polymorphisms in DNA repair and oxidative stress genes associated with pre-treatment cognitive function in breast cancer survivors: an exploratory study.
27099827|a|PURPOSE: The purpose of this exploratory candidate gene association study was to examine relationships between polymorphisms in oxidative stress and DNA repair genes and pre-adjuvant therapy cognitive function (CF) in postmenopausal women diagnosed with early stage-breast cancer. METHODS: Using a neuropsychological test battery, CF was assessed in 138 women diagnosed with breast cancer prior to initiation of adjuvant therapy and 81 age- and education-matched controls and summarized across eight composites. Participants were genotyped for 39 functional or tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of select oxidative stress (CAT, GPX1, SEPP1, SOD1, and SOD2) and DNA repair (ERCC2, ERCC3, ERCC5, and PARP1) genes. Multiple linear regression was used to determine if the presence or absence of one or more minor alleles account for variability in CF composite scores. Based on regression findings from the analysis of individual SNPs, weighted multi-gene, multi-polymorphism genetic risk scores (GRSs) were calculated to evaluate the collective effect of possession of multiple protective and/or risk alleles. RESULTS: Each CF composite was significantly (p < 0.05) associated with one or more oxidative stress and DNA repair gene polymorphisms evaluated either by SNP main effects and/or SNP-by-prescribed breast cancer treatment group interactions. Each computed GRS was found to be significantly (p < 0.001) related to its corresponding CF composite. All associations were positive suggesting that as overall genetic protection increases, CF composite score increases (indicating better performance). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that genetic variation in the oxidative stress and DNA repair pathways may play an important role in pre-adjuvant therapy CF in breast cancer survivors.
