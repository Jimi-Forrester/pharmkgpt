38888652|a|Aim: To investigate the efficacy of exosome-like nanovesicles from citrus lemon (EXO-CLs) in combating oxidative stress associated with Alzheimer's disease. Materials & methods: EXO-CLs were isolated through differential ultracentrifugation, characterized for particle size and evaluated for antioxidant activity. Results: EXO-CLs exhibited a mean size of 93.77 +- 12.31 nm, demonstrated permeability across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and displayed antioxidant activity comparable to ascorbic acid. Additionally, they were found to be non-toxic, with over 80% cell viability observed in SH-SY5Y cells. Conclusion: The study proposes that EXO-CLs could serve as an effective treatment for neurodegenerative diseases. This suggests a promising approach for targeted interventions in brain-related disorders, owing to the antioxidant properties and BBB permeability exhibited by EXO-CLs.
