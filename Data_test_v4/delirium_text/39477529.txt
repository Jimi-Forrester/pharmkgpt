39477529|a|Nucleic acids are a class of drugs that can modulate gene and protein expression by various mechanisms, namely, RNAi, mRNA degradation by RNase H cleavage, splice modulation, and steric blocking of protein binding or mRNA translation, thus exhibiting immense potential to treat various genetic and rare diseases. Unlike protein-targeted therapeutics, the clinical use of nucleic acids relies on Watson-Crick sequence recognition to regulate aberrant gene expression and impede protein translation. Though promising, targeted delivery remains a bottleneck for the clinical adoption of nucleic acid-based therapeutics. To overcome the delivery challenges associated with nucleic acids, various chemical modifications and bioconjugation-based delivery strategies have been explored. Currently, liver targeting by N-acetyl galactosamine (GalNAc) conjugation has been at the forefront for the treatment of rare and various metabolic diseases, which has led to FDA approval of four nucleic acid drugs. In addition, various other bioconjugation strategies have been explored to facilitate active organ and cell-enriched targeting. This review briefly covers the different classes of nucleic acids, their mechanisms of action, and their challenges. We also elaborate on recent advances in bioconjugation strategies in developing a diverse set of ligands for targeted delivery of nucleic acid drugs.
