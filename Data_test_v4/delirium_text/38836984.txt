38836984|t|Postoperative Multimodal Analgesia Strategy for Enhanced Recovery After Surgery in Elderly Colorectal Cancer Patients.
38836984|a|Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocols have substantially proven their merit in diminishing recuperation durations and mitigating postoperative adverse events in geriatric populations undergoing colorectal cancer procedures. Despite this, the pivotal aspect of postoperative pain control has not garnered the commensurate attention it deserves. Typically, employing a multimodal analgesia regimen that weaves together nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, opioids, local anesthetics, and nerve blocks stands paramount in curtailing surgical complications and facilitating reduced convalescence within hospital confines. Nevertheless, this integrative pain strategy is not devoid of pitfalls; the specter of organ dysfunction looms over the geriatric cohort, rooted in the abuse of analgesics or the complex interplay of polypharmacy. Revolutionary research is delving into alternative delivery and release modalities, seeking to allay the inadvertent consequences of analgesia and thereby potentially elevating postoperative outcomes for the elderly post-colorectal cancer surgery populace. This review examines the dual aspects of multimodal analgesia regimens by comparing their established benefits with potential limitations and offers insight into the evolving strategies of drug administration and release.
