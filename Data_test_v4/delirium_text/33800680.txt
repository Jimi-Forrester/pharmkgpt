33800680|t|Brain Molecular Connectivity in Neurodegenerative Conditions.
33800680|a|Positron emission tomography (PET) allows for the in vivo assessment of early brain functional and molecular changes in neurodegenerative conditions, representing a unique tool in the diagnostic workup. The increased use of multivariate PET imaging analysis approaches has provided the chance to investigate regional molecular processes and long-distance brain circuit functional interactions in the last decade. PET metabolic and neurotransmission connectome can reveal brain region interactions. This review is an overview of concepts and methods for PET molecular and metabolic covariance assessment with evidence in neurodegenerative conditions, including Alzheimer's disease and Lewy bodies disease spectrum. We highlight the effects of environmental and biological factors on brain network organization. All of the above might contribute to innovative diagnostic tools and potential disease-modifying interventions.
