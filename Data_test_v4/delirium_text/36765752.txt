36765752|t|CAR-T Cell Therapy and the Gut Microbiota.
36765752|a|Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) - T cell cancer therapy has yielded promising results in treating hematologic malignancies in clinical studies, and a growing number of CAR-T regimens are approved for clinical usage. While the therapy is considered of great potential in expanding the cancer immunotherapy arsenal, more than half of patients receiving CAR-T infusions do not respond, while others develop significant adverse effects, collectively indicating a need for optimization of CAR-T treatment to the individual. The microbiota is increasingly suggested as a major modulator of immunotherapy responsiveness. Studying causal microbiota roles possibly contributing to CAR-T therapy efficacy, adverse effects reduction, and prediction of patient responsiveness constitutes an exciting area of active research. Herein, we discuss the latest developments implicating human microbiota involvement in CAR-T therapy, while highlighting challenges and promises in harnessing the microbiota as a predictor and modifier of CAR-T treatment towards optimized efficacy and minimization of treatment-related adverse effects.
