39092582|t|Exploring the association between melatonin and nicotine dependence (Review).
39092582|a|Due to the addictive qualities of tobacco products and the compulsive craving and dependence associated with their use, nicotine dependence continues to be a serious public health concern on a global scale. Despite awareness of the associated health risks, nicotine addiction contributes to numerous acute and chronic medical conditions, including cardiovascular disease, respiratory disorders and cancer. The nocturnal secretion of pineal melatonin, known as the 'hormone of darkness', influences circadian rhythms and is implicated in addiction-related behaviors. Melatonin receptors are found throughout the brain, influencing dopaminergic neurotransmission and potentially attenuating nicotine-seeking behavior. Additionally, the antioxidant properties of melatonin may mitigate oxidative stress from chronic nicotine exposure, reducing cellular damage and lowering the risk of nicotine-related health issues. In addition to its effects on circadian rhythmicity, melatonin acting via specific neural receptors influences sleep and mood, and provides neuroprotection. Disruptions in melatonin signaling may contribute to sleep disturbances and mood disorders, highlighting the potential therapeutic role of melatonin in addiction and psychiatric conditions. Melatonin may influence neurotransmitter systems involved in addiction, such as the dopaminergic, glutamatergic, serotonergic and endogenous opioid systems. Preclinical studies suggest the potential of melatonin in modulating reward processing, attenuating drug-induced hyperactivity and reducing opioid withdrawal symptoms. Chronotherapeutic approaches targeting circadian rhythms and melatonin signaling show promise in smoking cessation interventions. Melatonin supplementation during periods of heightened nicotine cravings may alleviate withdrawal symptoms and reduce the reinforcing effects of nicotine. Further research is required however, to examine the molecular mechanisms underlying the melatonin-nicotine association and the optimization of therapeutic interventions. Challenges include variability in individual responses to melatonin, optimal dosing regimens and identifying biomarkers of treatment response. Understanding these complexities could lead to personalized treatment strategies and improve smoking cessation outcomes.
