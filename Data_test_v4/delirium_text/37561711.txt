37561711|a|This study was performed to investigate the usefulness of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) by conducting a comparative analysis of hemodynamic activation detected by fNIRS and positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Participants were divided into four groups: the subjective memory impairment (SMI), amnestic MCI (aMCI), non-amnestic MCI (naMCI), and AD groups. We recorded the hemodynamic response during the semantic verbal fluency task (SVFT) using a commercial wireless continuous-wave NIRS system. The correlation between the parameters of the neuroimaging assessments among the groups was analyzed. Region of interest-based comparisons showed that the four groups had significantly different hemodynamic responses during SVFT in the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). The linear mixed effect model result indicates that the mean DeltaHbO2 from the bilateral DLPFC regions showed a significant positive correlation to the overall FDG-PET after controlling for age and group differences in the fNIRS signals. Amyloid PET signals tended to better differentiate the AD group from other groups, and fNIRS signals tended to better differentiate the SMI group from other groups. In addition, a comparison between the group pairs revealed a mirrored pattern between the hippocampal volume and hemodynamic response in the DLPFC. The hemodynamic response detected by fNIRS showed a significant correlation with metabolic and anatomical changes associated with disease progression. Therefore, fNIRS may be considered as a screening tool to predict the hemodynamic and metabolic statuses of the brain in patients with MCI and AD.
