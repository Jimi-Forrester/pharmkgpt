39595539|t|Exploring the Dynamic Changes of Brain Lipids, Lipid Rafts, and Lipid Droplets in Aging and Alzheimer's Disease.
39595539|a|Aging induces complex changes in the lipid profiles across different areas of the brain. These changes can affect the function of brain cells and may contribute to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Research shows that while the overall lipid profile in the human brain remains quite steady throughout adulthood, specific changes occur with age, especially after the age of 50. These changes include a slow decline in total lipid content and shifts in the composition of fatty acids, particularly in glycerophospholipids and cholesterol levels, which can vary depending on the brain region. Lipid rafts play a crucial role in maintaining membrane integrity and facilitating cellular signaling. In the context of Alzheimer's disease, changes in the composition of lipid rafts have been associated with the development of the disease. For example, alterations in lipid raft composition can lead to increased accumulation of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides, contributing to neurotoxic effects. Lipid droplets store neutral lipids and are key for cellular energy metabolism. As organisms age, the dynamics of lipid droplets in the brain change, with evidence suggesting a decline in metabolic activity over time. This reduced activity may lead to an imbalance in lipid synthesis and mobilization, contributing to neurodegenerative processes. In model organisms like Drosophila, studies have shown that lipid metabolism in the brain can be influenced by diet and insulin signaling pathways, crucial for maintaining metabolic balance. The interplay between lipid metabolism, oxidative stress, and inflammation is critical in the context of aging and Alzheimer's disease. Lipid peroxidation, a consequence of oxidative stress, can lead to the formation of reactive aldehydes that further damage neurons. Inflammatory processes can also disrupt lipid metabolism, contributing to the pathology of AD. Consequently, the accumulation of oxidized lipids can affect lipid raft integrity, influencing signaling pathways involved in neuronal survival and function.
