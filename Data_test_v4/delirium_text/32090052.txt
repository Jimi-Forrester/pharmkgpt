32090052|a|BACKGROUND: We aimed to investigate the associations of critical care provided in a cardiac surgical intensive care unit (CSICU) staffed by an attending intensivist with improvements in intensive care unit (ICU) quality and reductions in postoperative complications. METHODS: Patients who underwent elective isolated coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) between January 2007 and December 2012 (the control group) were propensity-matched (1:1) to CABG patients between January 2013 and June 2018 (the intensivist group). RESULTS: Using propensity score matching, 302 patients were extracted from each group. The proportion of patients with at least 1 postoperative complication was significantly lower in the intensivist group than in the control group (17.2% vs. 28.5%, p=0.001). In the intensivist group, the duration of mechanical ventilation (6.4+-13.7 hours vs. 13.7+-49.3 hours, p=0.013) and length of ICU stay (28.7+-33.9 hours vs. 41.7+-90.4 hours, p=0.018) were significantly shorter than in the control group. The proportions of patients with prolonged mechanical ventilation (2.3% vs. 7.6%, p=0.006), delirium (1.3% vs. 6.3%, p=0.003) and acute kidney injury (1.3% vs. 5.3%, p=0.012) were significantly lower in the intensivist group than in the control group. CONCLUSION: A transition from an open ICU model with trainee coverage to a closed ICU model with attending intensivist coverage can be expected to yield improvements in CSICU quality and reductions in postoperative complications.
