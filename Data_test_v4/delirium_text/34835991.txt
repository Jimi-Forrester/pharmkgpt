34835991|t|Brain-Restricted Inhibition of IL-6 Trans-Signaling Mildly Affects Metabolic Consequences of Maternal Obesity in Male Offspring.
34835991|a|Maternal obesity greatly affects next generations, elevating obesity risk in the offspring through perinatal programming and flawed maternal and newborn nutrition. The exact underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) mediates its effects through a membrane-bound receptor or by trans-signaling (tS), which can be inhibited by the soluble form of the co-receptor gp130 (sgp130). As IL-6 tS mediates western-style diet (WSD) effects via chronic low-grade inflammation (LGI) and LGI is an important mediator in brain-adipose tissue communication, this study aims at determining the effects of maternal obesity in a transgenic mouse model of brain-restricted IL-6tS inhibition (GFAPsgp130) on offspring's short- and long-term body composition and epigonadal white adipose tissue (egWAT) metabolism. Female wild type (WT) or transgenic mice were fed either standard diet (SD) or WSD pregestationally, during gestation, and lactation. Male offspring received SD from postnatal day (P)21 to P56 and were metabolically challenged with WSD from P56 to P120. At P21, offspring from WT and transgenic dams that were fed WSD displayed increased body weight and egWAT mass, while glucose tolerance testing showed the strongest impairment in GFAPsgp130WSD offspring. Simultaneously, egWAT proteome reveals a characteristic egWAT expression pattern in offspring as a result of maternal conditions. IL-6tS inhibition in transgenic mice was in tendency associated with lower body weight in dams on SD and their respective offspring but blunted by the WSD. In conclusion, maternal nutrition affects offspring's body weight and egWAT metabolism predominantly independent of IL-6tS inhibition, emphasizing the importance of maternal and newborn nutrition for long-term offspring health.
