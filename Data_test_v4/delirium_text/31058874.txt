31058874|a|Recent findings have shown great potential of alternative interventions such as immunotherapy and natural products for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). This study aims to review the anti-AML effect of various natural compounds. Natural compounds were classified into five groups: alkaloids, carotenoids, nitrogen-containing compounds, organosulfur compounds or phenolics based on each compound's chemical properties. Fifty-eight studies were collected and reviewed in this article. Phenolics are the most abundant group to have an apoptotic effect over AML cells, while other groups have also shown significant apoptotic effects. Some compounds induced apoptosis by regulating unique mechanism like human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) or laminin receptor (67LR), while others modified caspases, poly (adp-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and p53. Further study is required to identify side-effects of potent compounds and the synergistic effects of combination of two or more natural compounds or existing conventional anti-AML drugs to treat this dreadful disease.
