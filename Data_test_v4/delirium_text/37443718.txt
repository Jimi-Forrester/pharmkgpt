37443718|t|Dietary Advanced Glycation End Products: Their Role in the Insulin Resistance of Aging.
37443718|a|Insulin resistance (IR) is commonly observed during aging and is at the root of many of the chronic nontransmissible diseases experienced as people grow older. Many factors may play a role in causing IR, but diet is undoubtedly an important one. Whether it is total caloric intake or specific components of the diet, the factors responsible remain to be confirmed. Of the many dietary influences that may play a role in aging-related decreased insulin sensitivity, advanced glycation end products (AGEs) appear particularly important. Herein, we have reviewed in detail in vitro, animal, and human evidence linking dietary AGEs contributing to the bodily burden of AGEs with the development of IR. We conclude that numerous small clinical trials assessing the effect of dietary AGE intake in combination with strong evidence in many animal studies strongly suggest that reducing dietary AGE intake is associated with improved IR in a variety of disease conditions. Reducing AGE content of common foods by simple changes in culinary techniques is a feasible, safe, and easily applicable intervention in both health and disease. Large-scale clinical trials are still needed to provide broader evidence for the deleterious role of dietary AGEs in chronic disease.
