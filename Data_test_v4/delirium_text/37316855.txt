37316855|a|BACKGROUND: The incessant and stressful nature of providing care to patients with chronic diseases can cause fatigue in caregivers. Caregivers' fatigue and reduced quality of life can reduce the patient's quality of care. Since it is important to pay attention to the mental health of family caregivers, this study investigated the relationship between fatigue and quality of life and their related factors in family caregivers of patients on hemodialysis. METHODS: This cross-sectional descriptive-analytical study was performed in 2020-2021. One hundred seventy family caregivers were recruited by convenience sampling from two hemodialysis referral centers in the east of Mazandaran province, Iran. The data collection tools were the Family Caregiver Quality of Life questionnaire and Krupp's fatigue severity scale. RESULTS: The majority (88%) of caregivers had moderate to severe fatigue. Caregivers' fatigue was a major factor influencing their quality of life. There was a significant fatigue difference between some categories of kinship and the caregiver's income level (P < 0.05). Caregivers with lower income and education levels, those who were the patient's spouse, and those who could not leave the patient alone had significantly worse quality of life than other caregivers (P < 0.05). Also, caregivers living with the patient in the same house had a worse quality of life than those living separately (P = 0.05). CONCLUSION: Considering the high prevalence of fatigue among family caregivers of patients on hemodialysis and its adverse effect on their quality of life, it is recommended to perform routine screenings and implement fatigue alleviation interventions for these caregivers.
