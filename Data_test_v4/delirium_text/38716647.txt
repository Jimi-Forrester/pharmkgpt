38716647|t|Risk Factors for Intracerebral Hemorrhage: Genome-Wide Association Study and Mendelian Randomization Analyses.
38716647|a|BACKGROUND: The genetic and nongenetic causes of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) remain obscure. The present study aimed to uncover the genetic and modifiable risk factors for ICH. METHODS: We meta-analyzed genome-wide association study data from 3 European biobanks, involving 7605 ICH cases and 711 818 noncases, to identify the genomic loci linked to ICH. To uncover the potential causal associations of cardiometabolic and lifestyle factors with ICH, we performed Mendelian randomization analyses using genetic instruments identified in previous genome-wide association studies of the exposures and ICH data from the present genome-wide association study meta-analysis. We performed multivariable Mendelian randomization analyses to examine the independent associations of the identified risk factors with ICH and evaluate potential mediating pathways. RESULTS: We identified 1 ICH risk locus, located at the APOE genomic region. The lead variant in this locus was rs429358 (chr19:45411941), which was associated with an odds ratio of ICH of 1.17 (95% CI, 1.11-1.20; P=6.01x10-11) per C allele. Genetically predicted higher levels of body mass index, visceral adiposity, diastolic blood pressure, systolic blood pressure, and lifetime smoking index, as well as genetic liability to type 2 diabetes, were associated with higher odds of ICH after multiple testing corrections. Additionally, a genetic increase in waist-to-hip ratio and liability to smoking initiation were consistently associated with ICH, albeit at the nominal significance level (P<0.05). Multivariable Mendelian randomization analysis showed that the association between body mass index and ICH was attenuated on adjustment for type 2 diabetes and further that type 2 diabetes may be a mediator of the body mass index-ICH relationship. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that the APOE locus contributes to ICH genetic susceptibility in European populations. Excess adiposity, elevated blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, and smoking were identified as the chief modifiable cardiometabolic and lifestyle factors for ICH.
