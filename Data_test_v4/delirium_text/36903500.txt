36903500|t|New Anti-Glycative Lignans from the Defatted Seeds of Sesamum indicum.
36903500|a|Seven known analogs, along with two previously undescribed lignan derivatives sesamlignans A (1) and B (2), were isolated from a water-soluble extract of the defatted sesame seeds (Sesamum indicum L.) by applying the chromatographic separation method. Structures of compounds 1 and 2 were elucidated based on extensive interpretation of 1D, 2D NMR, and HRFABMS spectroscopic data. The absolute configurations were established by analyzing the optical rotation and circular dichroism (CD) spectrum. Inhibitory effects against the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and peroxynitrite (ONOO-) scavenging assays were performed to evaluate the anti-glycation effects of all isolated compounds. Among the isolated compounds, (1) and (2) showed potent inhibition towards AGEs formation, with IC50 values of 7.5 +- 0.3 and 9.8 +- 0.5 muM, respectively. Furthermore, the new aryltetralin-type lignan 1 exhibited the most potent activity when tested in the in vitro ONOO- scavenging assay.
