31683111|t|The internationalization of human microbiome research.
31683111|a|The human microbiome has now been linked with myriad diseases, yet most of this research has been conducted on American and European populations that make up only 1/6th of the world's population. With growing recognition that human microbiomes differ tremendously across global populations, it is especially important to understand how these compositional differences impact health outcomes. Recent advances in infectious disease and malnutrition research have demonstrated the potential for microbiome-based strategies to address the biggest challenges in global health. This review highlights major advances toward understanding microbiome diversity across the world and its contributions to disease, and outlines key questions, challenges, and opportunities to broaden the scope of and promote inclusivity within microbiome research.
