32111039|t|Proteomic Analysis of Mucopolysaccharidosis IIIB Mouse Brain.
32111039|a|Mucopolysaccharidosis IIIB (MPS IIIB) is an inherited metabolic disease due to deficiency of alpha-N-Acetylglucosaminidase (NAGLU) enzyme with subsequent storage of undegraded heparan sulfate (HS). The main clinical manifestations of the disease are profound intellectual disability and neurodegeneration. A label-free quantitative proteomic approach was applied to compare the proteome profile of brains from MPS IIIB and control mice to identify altered neuropathological pathways of MPS IIIB. Proteins were identified through a bottom up analysis and 130 were significantly under-represented and 74 over-represented in MPS IIIB mouse brains compared to wild type (WT). Multiple bioinformatic analyses allowed to identify three major clusters of the differentially abundant proteins: proteins involved in cytoskeletal regulation, synaptic vesicle trafficking, and energy metabolism. The proteome profile of NAGLU-/- mouse brain could pave the way for further studies aimed at identifying novel therapeutic targets for the MPS IIIB. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with the identifier PXD017363.
