37047024|t|Insights into the Molecular Mechanisms of NRF2 in Kidney Injury and Diseases.
37047024|a|Redox is a constant phenomenon in organisms. From the signaling pathway transduction to the oxidative stress during the inflammation and disease process, all are related to reduction-oxidation (redox). Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) is a transcription factor targeting many antioxidant genes. In non-stressed conditions, NRF2 maintains the hemostasis of redox with housekeeping work. It expresses constitutively with basal activity, maintained by Kelch-like-ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1)-associated ubiquitination and degradation. When encountering stress, it can be up-regulated by several mechanisms to exert its anti-oxidative ability in diseases or inflammatory processes to protect tissues and organs from further damage. From acute kidney injury to chronic kidney diseases, such as diabetic nephropathy or glomerular disease, many results of studies have suggested that, as a master of regulating redox, NRF2 is a therapeutic option. It was not until the early termination of the clinical phase 3 trial of diabetic nephropathy due to heart failure as an unexpected side effect that we renewed our understanding of NRF2. NRF2 is not just a simple antioxidant capacity but has pleiotropic activities, harmful or helpful, depending on the conditions and backgrounds.
