32908484|a|Background: Increasing evidence has revealed that mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) transplantation alleviates hypoxic-ischemic brain damage (HIBD) induced neurological impairments via immunomodulating astrocyte antiapoptosis effects. However, it remains unclear whether MSCs regulate neuron autophagy following HIBD. Results: In the present study, MSC transplantation effectively ameliorated learning-memory function and suppressed stress-induced hippocampal neuron autophagy in HIBD rats. Moreover, the suppressive effects of MSCs on autophagy were significantly weakened following endogenous IL-6 silencing in MSCs. Suppressing IL-6 expression also significantly increased p-AMPK protein expression and decreased p-mTOR protein expression in injured hippocampal neurons. Conclusion: Endogenous IL-6 in MSCs may reduce autophagy in hippocampal neurons partly through the AMPK/mTOR pathway.
