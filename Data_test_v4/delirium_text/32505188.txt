32505188|a|BACKGROUND: Isoflurane can lead to neuron damage to the developing brain, resulting in learning and memory disability. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of miR-142-5p on isoflurane-induced neurological impairment. METHODS: The Morris water maze (MWM) test was performed to evaluate spatial learning and memory of rats. The expression level of miR-142-5p was measured using qRT-PCR. MTT assay was used to calculate the viability of hippocampal neuronal cells. The cell apoptosis was analyzed using Flow cytometric assay. RESULTS: Isoflurane treatment led to the increase of neurological function score and escape latency, and the reduction of time spent in the original quadrant in rats. The expression level of miR-142-5p was increased significantly in isoflurane-treated rats. MiR-142-5p downregulation protected against isoflurane-induced neurological impairment, which was reflected by the decrease of neurological function score and escape latency, and the increase of time spent in the original quadrant. In vitro, downregulation of miR-142-5p alleviated isoflurane-induced neuron cell viability inhibition, and relieved isoflurane-induced cell apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: MiR-142-5p downregulation plays a neuroprotective role in protecting against isoflurane-induced neurological impairment through regulating neuron cell viability and apoptosis. It provides a theoretical basis for the investigation of the mechanism underlying the effect on isoflurane-induced neurological impairment.
