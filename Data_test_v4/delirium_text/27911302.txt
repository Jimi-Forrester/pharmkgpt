27911302|a|BACKGROUND: Dementia is associated with a worse prognosis of hip fracture, but the impact of a dedicated geriatric care pathway on the prognosis of these patients has not been evaluated. OBJECTIVE: According to the cognitive status before surgery, our main objective was to compare mortality rate at 6 months; secondary outcomes were to compare in-hospital complications, the risk of new institutionalization, and the ability to walk at 6 months. METHODS: Between 2009 and 2015, all patients (>70 years) admitted after hip fracture surgery into a dedicated unit of peri-operative geriatric care were included: patients with dementia (DP), without dementia (NDP), and with cognitive status not determined (CSND). Data are expressed as hazard ratio (HR) for multivariate cox analysis or odds ratio (OR) for multivariate logistic regression analysis and their 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: We included 650 patients (86+-6 years): 168 DP, 400 NDP, and 82 CSND. After adjustment for age, sex, comorbidities, polypharmacy, pre-fracture autonomy, time-to-surgery, and delirium, there were no significant differences for 6-month mortality (DP versus NDP: HR = 0.7[0.4-1.2], DP versus CSND: HR = 0.6[0.3-1.4], CSND versus NDP: HR = 0.8[0.4-1.7]); but DP and CSND were more likely to be newly institutionalized after 6 months compared to NDP (OR DP = 2.6[1.4-4.9], p = 0.003, OR CSND = 2.9[1.4-6.1], p = 0.004). 92% of population was walking after 6 months (63% with assistance): no difference was found between the three groups. CONCLUSION: In a dedicated geriatric care pathway, DP and CSND undergoing hip surgery have the same 6-month mortality and walking ability as NDP.
