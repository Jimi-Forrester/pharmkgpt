23744245|a|INTRODUCTION: The rates of cognitive decline in patients with Alzheimer's disease show variations due to various factors. AIM. To determine the influence of age, education, gender, activities of daily living (ADL) and acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (IAChE) and memantine in the rhythm and rate of cognitive decline. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective study of a sample of 383 patients with Alzheimer's disease, with neuropsychological assessments over three years. Cognitive measure was used as the Cambridge Cognitive Examination (CAMCOG). Patients were grouped according to their rate of annual decline (RAD) and performed a bivariate and multivariate regression analysis using as dependent variable the difference in scores on the CAMCOG (baseline-final). RESULTS: The younger age (beta = -0.23; p < 0.001), more educated (beta = 0.26; p < 0.001) and the greater deterioration of ADL (beta = 0.24; p < 0.001) were associated with a greater decline in all patients. The drugs had a beneficial effect (beta = -0.18; p = 0.011) in the group with lower and slower decline (RAD < 5%). CONCLUSIONS: The lower age, higher education and the deterioration of ADL are associated with a greater cognitive decline. The IAChE and memantine had a beneficial effect, slowing the decline in the group of patients with lower RAD.
