32913021|a|OBJECTIVE: To determine whether treatment with escitalopram compared with placebo would lower CSF beta-amyloid 42 (Abeta42) levels. RATIONALE: Serotonin signaling suppresses Abeta42 in animal models of Alzheimer disease (AD) and young healthy humans. In a prospective study in older adults, we examined dose and treatment duration effects of escitalopram. METHODS: Using lumbar punctures to sample CSF levels before and after a course of escitalopram treatment, cognitively normal older adults (n = 114) were assigned to placebo, 20 mg escitalopram x 2 weeks, 20 mg escitalopram x 8 weeks, or 30 mg escitalopram x 8 weeks; CSF sampled pretreatment and posttreatment and within-subject percent change in Abeta42 was used as the primary outcome in subsequent analyses. RESULTS: An overall 9.4% greater reduction in CSF Abeta42 was found in escitalopram-treated compared with placebo-treated groups (p < 0.001, 95% confidence interval [CI] 4.9%-14.2%, d = 0.81). Positive baseline Abeta status (CSF Abeta42 levels <250 pg/mL) was associated with smaller Abeta42 reduction (p = 0.006, 95% CI -16.7% to 0.5%, d = -0.52) compared with negative baseline amyloid status (CSF Abeta42 levels >250 pg/mL). CONCLUSIONS: Short-term longitudinal doses of escitalopram decreased CSF Abeta42 in cognitively normal older adults, the target group for AD prevention. CLINICALTRIALSGOV IDENTIFIER: NCT02161458. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class II evidence that for cognitively normal older adults, escitalopram decreases CSF Abeta42.
