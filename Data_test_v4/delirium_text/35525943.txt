35525943|a|BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of a neurodegenerative disease (ND) produces profound changes in the quality of life of the affected families. Despite the vital importance of these processes, the scientific literature has addressed this topic almost exclusively relating to the main caregiver or using limited approaches. Thus, the main objective of this research is to achieve a deeper understanding of the quality of family life of people with a neurodegenerative disease, following a mixed-method approach that combines quantitative and qualitative methodology. METHODS: The quantitative instrument was the Spanish version of the Family Quality of Life Survey-Neurodegenerative Disease (FQOLS-ND), which was completed by 300 participating families. The qualitative methodology was used in two focus groups with family caregivers, with a total of 21 participants. RESULTS: On the one hand, confirmation of the dimensional structure of the scale in the focus groups was obtained and, on the other hand, the results of family quality of life in attainment and satisfaction were shown to be high for Family Relations and Careers and Planning for Careers and low for Support from Services and Leisure and Recreation. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study, through the combination of quantitative and qualitative information, helps to identify key issues to optimize services that respond to the priority needs of families.
