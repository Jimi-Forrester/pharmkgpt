29882083|t|High Incidence of Copy Number Variants in Adults with Intellectual Disability and Co-morbid Psychiatric Disorders.
29882083|a|A genetic analysis of unexplained mild-moderate intellectual disability and co-morbid psychiatric or behavioural disorders is not systematically conducted in adults. A cohort of 100 adult patients affected by both phenotypes were analysed in order to identify the presence of copy number variants (CNVs) responsible for their condition identifying a yield of 12.8% of pathogenic CNVs (19% when including clinically recognizable microdeletion syndromes). Moreover, there is a detailed clinical description of an additional 11% of the patients harbouring possible pathogenic CNVs-including a 7q31 deletion (IMMP2L) in two unrelated patients and duplications in 3q29, 9p24.2p24.1 and 15q14q15.1-providing new evidence of its contribution to the phenotype. This study adds further proof of including chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) as a mandatory test to improve the diagnosis in the adult patients in psychiatric services.
