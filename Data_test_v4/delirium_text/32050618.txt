32050618|t|Therapeutic Potential of Direct Clearance of the Amyloid-beta in Alzheimer's Disease.
32050618|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by deposition and accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) and its corresponding plaques within the brain. Although much debate exists whether these plaques are the cause or the effect of AD, the accumulation of Abeta is linked with the imbalance between the production and clearance of Abeta. The receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE) facilitates entry of free Abeta from the peripheral stream. Conversely, lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1), located in the abluminal side at the blood-brain barrier mediates the efflux of Abeta. Research on altering the rates of clearance of A by targeting these two pathways has been extensively study. Additionally, a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) circulation assistant device has also been evaluated as an approach to increase solute concentration in the CSF via mechanical drainage, to allow for removal of Abeta from the brain. Herein, we provide a brief review of these approaches that are designed to re-establish a homeostatic Abeta balance in the brain.
