30735665|t|Comparison between amyloid-PET and CSF amyloid-beta biomarkers in a clinical cohort with memory deficits.
30735665|a|With increasing prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and advances in research of therapeutic approaches, an early and accurate in-vivo diagnosis is crucial. Different biomarkers that are able to identify AD are currently in focus. However, whether and to which extend results of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and imaging biomarkers are comparable, is unclear. This study aims to correlate CSF and amyloid imaging biomarkers comparing them to cognitive measurements in order to determine whether these methods provide identical or complementary information. The study comprises 33 consecutive patients with suspected cognitive decline that underwent lumbar puncture for CSF biomarker analysis and Amyloid-PET/CT within the diagnostic evaluation of memory impairment. Amyloid PET/CTs were evaluated visually and quantitatively. CSF and imaging data were retrospectively evaluated and results were compared to cognition tests, age, gender, and ApoE status. Global cortex SUVr levels correlated highly with CSF Abeta42/40 and moderately with Abeta42 but not with Abeta40. Global cortex SUVr and Abeta42/40 correlated with mini mental status examination. This study indicates that Amyloid-PET and CSF biomarkers might not reflect identical clinical information and a combination of both seems to be the most accurate way to characterize clinically unclear cognitive decline.
