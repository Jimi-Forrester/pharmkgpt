39116070|a|BACKGROUND: Electrolytes (sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, chloride, phosphate) are required in specific amounts for proper functioning of the human body. Although the body has different organ systems, such as the kidneys, that regulate electrolyte levels in the blood, electrolyte abnormalities occur frequently in people with eating disorders. The objective of this review will be to examine the association between electrolyte imbalances and adverse outcomes in people with eating disorders. METHODS: A systematic review of studies on eating and electrolyte disorders shall be conducted. Electronic searches shall be done in the Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO databases. Selected studies shall include randomized control trials (RCTs), non-randomized controlled trials, and cross-sectional studies published in English or French. Quality appraisal of studies and a narrative synthesis of extracted data shall be conducted. DISCUSSION: This review will synthesize existing evidence on electrolyte abnormalities in people with eating disorders. It will identify the type of electrolyte imbalances, their impact, and outcomes in people with eating disorders. We anticipate that information that will be useful to policy makers and clinicians in designing better policies to prevent eating disorders and or manage people with eating disorders shall be elucidated in this study. DISSEMINATION: The final manuscript will be submitted for publication in a journal. REVIEW REGISTRATION: This protocol has been registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO); registration number CRD42023477497.
