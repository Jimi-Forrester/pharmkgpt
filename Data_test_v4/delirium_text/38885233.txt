38885233|a|BACKGROUND: The inflammatory response is a key factor in the pathogenesis of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury (CIRI), and anti-inflammatory interventions may offer a promising therapeutic strategy. Forsythoside B (FB) is a phenylethanoid glycoside isolated from Forsythiae fructus, which has been reported to have anti-inflammatory effects. However, the mechanism of the neuroprotective effect of FB on CIRI remains unclear. METHODS: Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R). FB was administered intraperitoneally for 3 days prior to MCAO/R. Cerebral infarct volume and neurological deficit score were used as indices to evaluate MCAO/R injury. The serum levels of inflammatory factors and antioxidant enzymes were measured. The activation of silent information regulator 2 homolog 1 (Sirt1) and the inhibition of the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor with a pyrin domain 3 (NLRP3) pathway were assessed through western blot and immunohistochemistry analysis. Furthermore, the rats were treated with Sirt1 shRNA 3 days before MCAO/R by stereotactical injection into the ipsilateral hemispheric region to assess the impact of Sirt1 knockdown on the protection of FB during MCAO/R. RESULTS: FB reduced cerebral infarct volume and neurological deficit score in MCAO/R rats. FB reduced pathological changes and cell apoptosis in the hippocampal CA1 region and cortex on the ischemic side of rats. FB inhibited the serum levels of inflammatory factors and increased the activities of antioxidant enzymes. Further study showed that FB inhibited the activation of the NLRP3 pathway and induced Sirt1 activation. CONCLUSION: FB demonstrated neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting the NLRP3 pathway through Sirt1 activation in CIRI.
