38795037|t|In Vitro and In Vivo Investigations of Chromone Derivatives as Potential Multitarget-Directed Ligands: Cognitive Amelioration Utilizing a Scopolamine-Induced Zebrafish Model.
38795037|a|Alzheimer's disease is a complex neurological disorder linked with multiple pathological hallmarks. The interrelation of therapeutic targets assists in the enhancement of cognitive decline through interference with overall neuronal transmission. We have synthesized and screened various chromone derivatives as potential multitarget-directed ligands for the effective treatment of Alzheimer's disease. The synthesized compounds exhibited multipotent activity against AChE, BuChE, MAO-B, and amyloid beta aggregation. Three potent compounds, i.e., VN-3, VN-14, and VN-19 were identified that displayed remarkable activities against different targets. These compounds displayed IC50 values of 80 nM, 2.52 muM, and 140 nM against the AChE enzyme, respectively, and IC50 values of 2.07 muM, 70 nM, and 450 nM against the MAO-B isoform, respectively. VN-3 displayed potent activity against self-induced Abeta1-42 aggregation with inhibition of 58.3%. In the ROS inhibition studies, the most potent compounds reduced the intracellular ROS levels up to 80% in SH-SY5Y cells at 25 muM concentration. The compounds were found to be neuroprotective and noncytotoxic even at a concentration of 25 muM against SH-SY5Y cells. In silico studies showed that the compounds were nicely accommodated in the active sites of the receptors along with thermodynamically stable orientations. Compound VN-19 exhibited a balanced multitargeting profile against AChE, BuChE, MAO-B, and Abeta1-42 enzymes and was further evaluated for in vivo activities on the scopolamine-induced zebrafish model. VN-19 was found to ameliorate the cognitive decline in zebrafish brains by protecting them against scopolamine-induced neurodegeneration. Thus, VN-3, VN-14, and VN-19 were identified as potent multitarget-directed ligands with a balanced activity profile against different targets and can be developed as therapeutics for AD.
