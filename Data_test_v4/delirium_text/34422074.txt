34422074|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease is a neurological condition that affects about 44 million people worldwide. The available treatments target symptoms rather than the underlying causes. Ziziphus jujuba (Rhamnaceae) is widely used in traditional Cameroonian medicine to treat diabetes, pain, infections, and dementia. Previous studies reported that Z. jujuba aqueous macerate improves working memory impairment, but no study on the antiamnesic effect of a concoction of Z. jujuba in rats has been performed. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the antiamnesic and neuroprotective effects of an aqueous extract of Z. jujuba on scopolamine-induced cognitive impairments in rats. METHODS: Learning and memory impairments were induced in rats by administering scopolamine (1 mg/kg, i.p.) to 58 rats for 15 days. Rats that developed learning and memory impairments in Morris water maze and Y-maze paradigms were divided into 7 groups (8 rats each) and treated daily for 15 days as follows: the normal control group received distilled water (10 ml/kg, p.o.), the negative control group received distilled water (10 ml/kg, p.o.), positive control groups either received donepezil (1.2 mg/kg, p.o.) or tacrine (10 mg/kg, p.o.), and the three test groups were given the extract (29, 57, and 114 mg/kg, p.o.). At the end of treatments, learning and memory impairments were determined using the same paradigms. Animals were then euthanized, and biochemical parameters of oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis were analyzed in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. RESULTS: On the 4th day of the acquisition phase in the Morris water maze, Z. jujuba (29 and 114 mg/kg) reduced (p < 0.001) the latency to reach the platform, while in the retention phase, Z. jujuba (57 and 114 mg/kg) decreased (p < 0.001) the time to reach the platform and increased the time in the target quadrant (p < 0.05) compared to control. Surprisingly, the extract failed to affect spontaneous alternations in the Y-maze. Furthermore, the extract (29, 57, and 114 mg/kg) reversed (p < 0.001) scopolamine-induced oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis. This was supported by the reduction of neuronal alterations in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to donepezil, a standard drug against Alzheimer's disease, these findings suggest that Z. jujuba extract possesses antiamnesic and neuroprotective effects, and these effects are mediated in part through antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiapoptotic activities. These findings help to explain its use in treating psychiatric disorders in Cameroon's folk medicine.
