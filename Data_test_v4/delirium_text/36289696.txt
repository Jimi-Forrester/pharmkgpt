36289696|t|Role of Sirtuins in Physiology and Diseases of the Central Nervous System.
36289696|a|Silent information regulators, sirtuins (SIRTs), are a family of enzymes which take part in major posttranslational modifications of proteins and contribute to multiple cellular processes, including metabolic and energetic transformations, as well as regulation of the cell cycle. Recently, SIRTs have gained increased attention as the object of research because of their multidirectional activity and possible role in the complex pathomechanisms underlying human diseases. The aim of this study was to review a current literature evidence of SIRTs' role in the physiology and pathology of the central nervous system (CNS). SIRTs have been demonstrated to be crucial players in the crosstalk between neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration, and metabolic alterations. The elucidation of SIRTs' role in the background of various CNS diseases offers a chance to define relevant markers of their progression and promising candidates for novel therapeutic targets. Possible diagnostic and therapeutic implications from SIRTs-related investigations are discussed, as well as their future directions and associated challenges.
