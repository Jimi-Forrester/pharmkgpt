32076017|t|Prevalence and association of single nucleotide polymorphisms with sarcopenia in older women depends on definition.
32076017|a|The prevalence of sarcopenia depends on the definition used. There are, however, consistent sarcopenic characteristics, including a low muscle mass and muscle strength. Few studies have investigated the relationship between sarcopenia and genotype. A cross-sectional study was conducted with 307 community-dwelling >=60-year-old women in South Cheshire, UK. Handgrip strength was assessed with a handgrip dynamometer and skeletal muscle mass was estimated using bioelectrical impedance. DNA was extracted from saliva (~38%) or blood (~62%) and 24 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped. Three established sarcopenia definitions - %Skeletal Muscle Mass (%SMM), Skeletal Muscle Mass Index (SMI) and European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP) - were used to assess sarcopenia prevalence. Binary logistic regression with age as covariate was used to identify SNPs associated with sarcopenia. The prevalence of sarcopenia was: %SMM 14.7%, SMI 60.6% and EWGSOP 1.3%. Four SNPs were associated with the %SMM and SMI definitions of sarcopenia; FTO rs9939609, ESR1 rs4870044, NOS3 rs1799983 and TRHR rs7832552. The first three were associated with the %SMM definition, and TRHR rs7832552 with the SMI definition, but none were common to both sarcopenia definitions. The gene variants associated with sarcopenia may help proper counselling and interventions to prevent individuals from developing sarcopenia.
