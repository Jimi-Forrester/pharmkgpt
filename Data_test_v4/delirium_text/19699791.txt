19699791|a|The ultimate goal of diagnostic research is a blood test detecting the risk of Alzheimer disease (AD) before neuronal damage develops. Current amyloid-beta (Abeta) tests do not detect the process leading to neurodegeneration. Novel immunologic and proteomics tests are based on aberrant appearance of inflammatory cytokines in the CSF and other protein biomarkers in the CSF or blood, and immune biomarkers of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC's). Cytokines, chemokines, complement factors, serum amyloid P component, and signaling proteins in the CSF or blood may be a rich source of diagnostic biomarkers, but the power of these tests will need to be examined in prospective studies. Recently-described flow cytometric test of defective Abeta phagocytosis detects patients with AD with a high sensitivity and specificity in distinct populations (confirmed AD patients vs. active University professors), but further experience is necessary for its use in general population at risk of AD. The analysis of the transcriptome of peripheral blood mononuclear cells "stressed" by Abeta is beginning to unravel the relations between specific pathways and AD. Thus novel diagnostic tests may provide biomarkers for pre-clinical detection, clarification of progression from MCI to AD, and follow-up of patients in clinical trials of immunostimulating therapies.
