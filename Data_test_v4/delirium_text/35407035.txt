35407035|a|Flowers have always accompanied people thanks to their manifold aesthetic properties. Some species have also become a component of the human diet. Recent years have seen an increased interest in edible flowers and, consequently, research has been undertaken to determine their chemical composition. Dyes that are abundantly contained in flowers, whose role is to attract pollinating animals, are recognized substances with health-promoting properties. Anthocyanins are a group of dyes that are very common in petals and other parts of flowers. Studies carried out in the twentieth and twenty-first century on flowers growing in temperate climates have found very strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of anthocyanins. Therefore, flowers used by humans for centuries to decorate their surroundings may become an easily available source of nutrients and health-promoting substances. This paper discusses the health-promoting properties of anthocyanins and collects literature on anthocyanin content in edible flowers commonly grown on balconies, terraces, and roofs in countries of temperate climate.
