36459652|t|Age-related brain atrophy is not a homogenous process: Different functional brain networks associate differentially with aging and blood factors.
36459652|a|Aging is characterized by a progressive loss of brain volume at an estimated rate of 5% per decade after age 40. While these morphometric changes, especially those affecting gray matter and atrophy of the temporal lobe, are predictors of cognitive performance, the strong association with aging obscures the potential parallel, but more specific role, of individual subject physiology. Here, we studied a cohort of 554 human subjects who were monitored using structural MRI scans and blood immune protein concentrations. Using machine learning, we derived a cytokine clock (CyClo), which predicted age with good accuracy (Mean Absolute Error = 6 y) based on the expression of a subset of immune proteins. These proteins included, among others, Placenta Growth Factor (PLGF) and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF), both involved in angiogenesis, the chemoattractant vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), the canonical inflammatory proteins interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha), the chemoattractant IP-10 (CXCL10), and eotaxin-1 (CCL11), previously involved in brain disorders. Age, sex, and the CyClo were independently associated with different functionally defined cortical networks in the brain. While age was mostly correlated with changes in the somatomotor system, sex was associated with variability in the frontoparietal, ventral attention, and visual networks. Significant canonical correlation was observed for the CyClo and the default mode, limbic, and dorsal attention networks, indicating that immune circulating proteins preferentially affect brain processes such as focused attention, emotion, memory, response to social stress, internal evaluation, and access to consciousness. Thus, we identified immune biomarkers of brain aging which could be potential therapeutic targets for the prevention of age-related cognitive decline.
