25416976|a|During the last years there is an increasing trend on the study of mitochondrial populations mainly in neural cells, due to their association with neurological disorders like Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Autism, and CMT2A. Several studies concerning modeling of mitochondrial protein pathways, simulation of mitochondrial dynamics, biomarkers associated with Reactive Oxygen Species and many other related topics are already published. In this study we establish the idea of natural superconductivity in mitochondrial level as a necessary theoretical framework for the normal production of ATP and the avoidance of adverse reactions in Central Neural System.
