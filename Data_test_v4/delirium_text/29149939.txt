29149939|t|Improving Long-Term Outcomes After Sepsis.
29149939|a|Although acute survival from sepsis has improved in recent years, a large fraction of sepsis survivors experience poor long-term outcomes. In particular, sepsis survivors have high rates of weakness, cognitive impairment, hospital readmission, and late death. To improve long-term outcomes, in-hospital care should focus on early, effective treatment of sepsis; minimization of delirium, distress, and immobility; and preparing patients for hospital discharge. In the posthospital setting, medical care should focus on addressing new disability and preventing medical deterioration, providing a sustained period out of the hospital to allow for recovery.
