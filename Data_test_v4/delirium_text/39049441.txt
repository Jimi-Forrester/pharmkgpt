39049441|a|Development of late-life mobility disability is a dynamic process of transitions between worsening and improving. We tested associations between participation in physical, social, and cognitive activity with mobility disability transitions. Participants (N=2,758, age 78.1 years [SD: 7.7]) from two Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center cohorts completed annual mobility disability questionnaires for 7.6 (SD: 4.4) years. First-order Markov transition models tested associations between baseline self-reported physical, social, and cognitive activity with bidirectional transitions in mobility disability score increases (worsening) and decreases (improving) between consecutive visits. Overall, 75.5% of participants experienced >=1 transition among 18,318 pairs of consecutive visits-4,174 of which were worsening and 2,606 were improving transitions. Adjusting for covariates, higher participation in each activity type was associated with lower odds of worsening (physical OR=0.71, 95% CI: 0.67-0.75; social OR=0.64, 95% CI: 0.58-0.70; and cognitive OR=0.79, 95% CI: 0.74-0.85), and higher odds of improving (physical OR=1.20, 95% CI: 1.11-1.28; social OR=1.45, 95% CI: 1.30-1.61; and cognitive OR=1.12, 95% CI: 1.03-1.22) in separate models. In combined models, physical and social activity remained associated with worsening and improving; cognitive activity was only associated with worsening. Physical, social, and cognitive activity engagement contributes to lower odds of worsening mobility disability and may promote recovery.
