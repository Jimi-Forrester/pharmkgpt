37889231|t|Ascending Aortic Surgery for Small Aneurysms in Men and Women.
37889231|a|INTRODUCTION: According to recent data, thoracic aortic surgery has reduced morbidity and mortality including ascending aortic aneurysm treatment; however, women are at increased postoperative risk of adverse outcomes. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to evaluate early and late outcomes in male and female patients who underwent pre-emptive ascending aortic replacement (AAR). METHODS: From January 2013 to September 2021, 91 patients (56 [61.5%] men and 35 [38.5%] women) underwent AAR for small (ranged from 5.0 to 5.5 cm) non-syndromic aneurysms. A propensity score-based adjustment of the groups was performed. We compared clinical outcomes between males and females. RESULTS: Preoperative normalized aortic diameters were significantly larger in females (2.9 [2.7; 3.2] cm/m2) than in males (2.5 [2.3; 2.6] cm/m2, P<0.001), without differences in absolute values (51 [49; 53] mm vs. 52 [50; 53] mm, P=0.356). There were no significant differences in neurological, cardiac, pulmonary, and renal complications in both groups before and after matching. In-hospital mortality was 1 (1.8%) and 2 (5.7%) (P=0.307) in male and female patients in unmatched groups and 1 (2.9%) and 2 (5.7%) (P=0.553) in matched groups, respectively. Univariate logistic regression analysis revealed that the only risk factor for in-hospital mortality was age (odds ratio 1.117, 95% confidence interval 1.003-1.244; P=0.04). The overall survival rate was 83.5+-0.06% in men and 94.3+-0.04% in women at 36 months (P=0.404). CONCLUSION: Ascending aortic surgery for aneurysms ranged from 5.0 to 5.5 cm seems to have tolerable early and late outcomes in men and women.
