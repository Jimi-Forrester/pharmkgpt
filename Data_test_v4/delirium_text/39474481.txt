39474481|t|Dual-Functional Fluorescent Probe in the Diagnosis of Liver Injury and the Evaluation of Drug Therapy with Double Signal Amplification.
39474481|a|Viscosity and polarity are crucial microenvironmental parameters within cells, intimately linked to the physiological activities of organisms. We constructed and synthesized an innovative dual-functional fluorescent probe, DHBP. In the green channel, the fluorescence signal notably intensifies with decreasing environmental polarity, while in the red channel, fluorescence signal amplification occurs due to the collaborative effects of viscosity and polarity, resulting in more pronounced changes. Additionally, DHBP demonstrates high sensitivity in detecting changes in polarity and viscosity induced by drug-induced inflammation in cells and mice. Importantly, DHBP has been effectively utilized to monitor alterations in viscosity and polarity in the liver injury induced by diabetes in vivo in mice and further employed to assess the therapeutic efficacy of drugs. Therefore, DHBP holds promise for advancing research on viscosity and polarity in future studies of physiological and pathological processes.
