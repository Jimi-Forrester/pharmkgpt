28935974|a|Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) are a promising therapy for immunological disorders. However, culture expanded MSC are large and get trapped in the capillary networks of the lungs after intravenous infusion, where they have a short survival time. Hypothetically, living cells are a risk for tumor formation. To reduce risks associated with MSC infusion and improve the distribution in the body, we generated membrane particles (MP) of MSC and MSC stimulated with IFN-gamma (MPgamma). Tracking analysis and electron microscopy indicated that the average size of MP was 120 nm, and they showed a round shape. MP exhibited ATPase, nucleotidase and esterase activity, indicating they are enzymatically active. MP and MPgamma did not physically interact with T cells and had no effect on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells proliferation. However, MP and MPgamma selectively bound to monocytes and decreased the frequency of pro-inflammatory CD14+CD16+ monocytes by induction of selective apoptosis. MP and MPgamma increased the percentage of CD90 positive monocytes, and MPgamma but not MP increased the percentage of anti-inflammatory PD-L1 monocytes. MPgamma increased mRNA expression of PD-L1 in monocytes. These data demonstrate that MP have immunomodulatory properties and have potential as a novel cell-free therapy for treatment of immunological disorders.
