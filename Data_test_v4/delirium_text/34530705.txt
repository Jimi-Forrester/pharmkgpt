34530705|t|Neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's Disease: Focus on NLRP1 and NLRP3 Inflammasomes.
34530705|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the main cause of dementia worldwide. The definitive diagnosis of AD is clinicopathological and based on the identification of cerebral deposition of Amyloid beta (Abeta) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. However, the link between amyloid cascade and depositions of phosphorylated tau (p-tau) is still missing. In this scenario, inflammasomes might play a relevant role. Experimental models of AD have suggested that Abeta accumulation induces, through microglia, activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. This activation contributes to the dissemination of Abeta and p-tau, as well as to hyperphosphorylation of tau. Also, in experimental models, NLPR1 promoted neuronal pyroptosis. There are neither comprehensive neuropathologic characterization nor clinicopathologic studies evaluating the NLRP1 and NLRP3 inflammasomes in subjects with AD. The current mini-review aims to summarize recent and promising findings on the role of NLRP1 and NLRP3 signaling in the pathophysiology of AD. We also sought to highlight the knowledge gap in patients with AD, mainly the lack of clinicopathologic studies on the interaction among inflammasomes, Abeta/tau pathology, and cognitive decline.
