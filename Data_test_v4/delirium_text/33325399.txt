33325399|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease worldwide. Considering the devastating symptoms, high prevalence, and lack of definitive diagnostic test, there is an urgent need to identify possible biomarkers and new therapeutic targets. Genes identified and/or proposed to be linked to PD encode proteins that fulfill diverse roles in cellular functions. There is a growing interest in identifying common traits which lead to the disease. Long non-coding RNAs have recently emerged as possible regulatory hubs of complex molecular changes affecting PD development. Among them, NEAT1 has attracted particular interest. It is a major component and the initiator of nuclear paraspeckles, thus regulating transcription and modifying protein functions. This review summarizes data available on the role of NEAT1 in PD. NEAT1 upregulation in PD has repeatedly been reported, however, whether this is part of a protective or a damaging mechanism is still a topic of debate. It has been proposed that NEAT1 propagates PD via its interaction with PINK1 and several micro RNAs and by modulating SNCA expression. On the other hand, findings of NEAT1 acting as a bona fide LRRK2 inhibitor argue for its protective role. These contradictory results could be due to the different disease models implemented. This calls attention to the difficulties posed by the complex patho-mechanisms of neurodegenerative disorders and the limitations of disease models. However, the potential of NEAT1 as a biomarker and as a therapeutic target for PD highly warrants further research to elucidate its exact role in this neurodegenerative disorder.
