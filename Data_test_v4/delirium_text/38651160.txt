38651160|a|INTRODUCTION: This study investigated whether self-reported sleep quality is associated with brain amyloid beta (Abeta) accumulation. METHODS: Linear mixed effect model analyses were conducted for 189 cognitively unimpaired (CU) older adults (mean +- standard deviation 74.0 +- 6.2; 53.2% female), with baseline self-reported sleep data, and positron emission tomography-determined brain Abeta measured over a minimum of three time points (range 33.3-72.7 months). Analyses included random slopes and intercepts, interaction for apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon4 allele status, and time, adjusting for sex and baseline age. RESULTS: Sleep duration <6 hours, in APOE epsilon4 carriers, and sleep efficiency <65%, in the whole sample and APOE epsilon4 non-carriers, is associated with faster accumulation of brain Abeta. DISCUSSION: These findings suggest a role for self-reported suboptimal sleep efficiency and duration in the accumulation of Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathology in CU individuals. Additionally, poor sleep efficiency represents a potential route via which individuals at lower genetic risk may progress to preclinical AD. Highlights: In cognitively unimpaired older adults self-report sleep is associated with brain amyloid beta (Abeta) accumulation.Across sleep characteristics, this relationship differs by apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype.Sleep duration <6 hours is associated with faster brain Abeta accumulation in APOE epsilon4 carriers.Sleep efficiency < 65% is associated with faster brain Abeta accumulation in APOE epsilon4 non-carriers.Personalized sleep interventions should be studied for potential to slow Abeta accumulation.
