36678174|t|Resting Energy Expenditure in the Critically Ill and Healthy Elderly-A Retrospective Matched Cohort Study.
36678174|a|The use of indirect calorimetry to measure resting energy expenditure (mREE) is widely recommended as opposed to calculating REE (cREE) by predictive equations (PE). The aim of this study was to compare mREE with cREE in critically ill, mechanically ventilated patients aged >= 75 years and a healthy control group matched by age, gender and body mass index. The primary outcome was the PE accuracy rate of mREE/cREE, derived using Bland Altman plots. Secondary analyses included linear regression analyses for determinants of intraindividual mREE/cREE differences in the critically ill and interindividual mREE differences in the matched healthy cohort. In this retrospective study, 90 critically ill patients (median age 80 years) and 58 matched healthy persons were included. Median mREE was significantly higher in the critically ill (1457 kcal/d) versus the healthy cohort (1351 kcal/d), with low PE accuracy rates (21% to 49%). Independent predictors of mREE/cREE differences in the critically ill were body temperature, heart rate, FiO2, hematocrit, serum sodium and urea. Body temperature, respiratory rate, and FiO2 were independent predictors of interindividual mREE differences (critically ill versus healthy control). In conclusion, the commonly used PE in the elderly critically ill are inaccurate. Respiratory, metabolic and energy homeostasis variables may explain intraindividual mREE/cREE as well as interindividual mREE differences.
