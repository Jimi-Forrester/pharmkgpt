2129870|t|Membrane fatty acid composition shows delta-6-desaturase abnormalities in Alzheimer's disease.
2129870|a|Brain membrane phospholipid fatty acid composition is investigated in Alzheimer's disease using fresh pathologically proven autopsy material. The most striking abnormalities in Alzheimer brains compared to age-matched controls are found in the n - 6 line of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) showing an elevation of 18:2 (n - 6) associated with a reduction of 20:4 (n - 6) and 22:4 (n - 6). The findings strongly indicate abnormalities in delta 6-desaturation. The decrease in 22:6 (n - 3) also supports delta 6-desaturase abnormalities. Alteration in PUFA desaturation/elongation processes and resultant membrane abnormalities may play a key role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.
