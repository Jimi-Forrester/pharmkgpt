33477935|t|The Impact of Air Pollution Exposure on the MicroRNA Machinery and Lung Cancer Development.
33477935|a|Small non-coding RNA molecules (miRNAs) play an important role in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression. As these molecules have been repeatedly implicated in human cancers, they have been suggested as biomarkers of the disease. Additionally, miRNA levels have been shown to be affected by environmental pollutants, including airborne contaminants. In this review, we searched the current literature for miRNAs involved in lung cancer, as well as miRNAs deregulated as a result of exposure to air pollutants. We then performed a synthesis of the data and identified those molecules commonly deregulated under both conditions. We detected a total of 25 miRNAs meeting the criteria, among them, miR-222, miR-21, miR-126-3p, miR-155 and miR-425 being the most prominent. We propose these miRNAs as biomarkers of choice for the identification of human populations exposed to air pollution with a significant risk of developing lung cancer.
