33260956|t|Vaccination against beta-Amyloid as a Strategy for the Prevention of Alzheimer's Disease.
33260956|a|Vaccination relies on the phenomenon of immunity, a long-term change in the immunological response to subsequent encounters with the same pathogen that occurs after the recovery from some infectious diseases. However, vaccination is a strategy that can, in principle, be applied also to non-infectious diseases, such as cancer or neurodegenerative diseases, if an adaptive immune response can prevent the onset of the disease or modify its course. Immunization against beta-amyloid has been explored as a vaccination strategy for Alzheimer's disease for over 20 years. No vaccine has been licensed so far, and immunotherapy has come under considerable criticism following the negative results of several phase III clinical trials. In this narrative review, we illustrate the working hypothesis behind immunization against beta-amyloid as a vaccination strategy for Alzheimer's disease, and the outcome of the active immunization strategies that have been tested in humans. On the basis of the lessons learned from preclinical and clinical research, we discuss roadblocks and current perspectives in this challenging enterprise in translational immunology.
