39559895|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD), the main type of dementia, involves in complex pathophysiological processes, including abnormal lysosomes function. Cathepsins are the predominant proteases responsible for the degradation of diverse substrates in the endo-lysosomal system. However, there was still a lack of systematic study on the causal association between cathepsins and AD. METHODS: This study utilized Mendelian randomization (MR) to investigate the association between blood cathepsins and the risk of AD, as well as the level of amyloid-beta (Abeta) and p-Tau in cerebrospinal fluid. Furthermore, an independent dataset was employed to corroborate the above result. Importantly, this study incorporated the Alzheimer's disease Immunization and Microbiota Initiative study Cohort to further validate the alteration of blood cathepsins expression level and examine its correlation with cognitive level and plasma AD-related pathological markers. RESULTS: Using MR method, we observed that high level of cathepsin L (CTSL) was associated with a lower risk of AD in both training and validation data. In observational cohort, we found there was decreased blood CTSL expression level in Abeta+ cognitive impaired (CI) group, compared with Abeta- cognitive unimpaired (CU) group. Correlation analysis revealed that blood CTSL expression level was negatively correlated with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score, plasma Abeta42 and Abeta42/40 level in Abeta+ CI group. Mediation analysis showed that plasma Abeta42/40 level was the key mediator in the association between blood CTSL and MMSE score in Abeta+ CI participants. CONCLUSION: This study revealed that blood CTSL was an important factor affecting the risk of AD, and it affected the cognitive level of AD patients through plasma Abeta42/40 level.
