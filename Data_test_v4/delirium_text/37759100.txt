37759100|t|Association of APOE gene with longitudinal changes of CSF amyloid beta and tau levels in Alzheimer's disease: racial differences.
37759100|a|BACKGROUND: The Apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon4 allele is a risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, no investigation has focused on racial differences in the longitudinal effect of APOE genotypes on CSF amyloid beta (Abeta42) and tau levels in AD. METHODS: This study used data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI): 222 participants with AD, 264 with cognitive normal (CN), and 692 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) at baseline and two years follow-up. We used a linear mixed model to investigate the effect of APOE-epsilon4-genotypes on longitudinal changes in the amyloid beta and tau levels. RESULTS: Individuals with 1 or 2 APOE epsilon4 alleles revealed significantly higher t-Tau and p-Tau, but lower amyloid beta Abeta42 compared with individuals without APOE epsilon4 alleles. Significantly higher levels of log-t-Tau, log-p-Tau, and low levels of log-Abeta42 were observed in the subjects with older age, being female, and the two diagnostic groups (AD and MCI). The higher p-Tau and Abeta42 values are associated with poor Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) performance. Non-Hispanic Africa American (AA) and Hispanic participants were associated with decreased log-t-Tau levels (beta =  - 0.154, p = 0.0112; beta =  - 0.207, and p = 0.0016, respectively) as compared to those observed in Whites. Furthermore, Hispanic participants were associated with a decreased log-p-Tau level (beta =  - 0.224, p = 0.0023) compared to those observed in Whites. There were no differences in Abeta42 level for non-Hispanic AA and Hispanic participants compared with White participants. CONCLUSION: Our study, for the first time, showed that the APOE epsilon4 allele was associated with these biomarkers, however with differing degrees among racial groups.
