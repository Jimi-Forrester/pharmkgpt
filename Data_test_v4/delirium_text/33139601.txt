33139601|t|Pancreatic Diseases and Microbiota: A Literature Review and Future Perspectives.
33139601|a|Gut microbiota represent an interesting worldwide research area. Several studies confirm that microbiota has a key role in human diseases, both intestinal (such as inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, intestinal infectious diseases, irritable bowel syndrome) and extra intestinal disorders (such as autism, multiple sclerosis, rheumatologic diseases). Nowadays, it is possible to manipulate microbiota by administering prebiotics, probiotics or synbiotics, through fecal microbiota transplantation in selected cases. In this scenario, pancreatic disorders might be influenced by gut microbiota and this relationship could be an innovative and inspiring field of research. However, data are still scarce and controversial. Microbiota manipulation could represent an important therapeutic strategy in the pancreatic diseases, in addition to standard therapies. In this review, we analyze current knowledge about correlation between gut microbiota and pancreatic diseases, by discussing on the one hand existing data and on the other hand future possible perspectives.
