35402827|a|The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in China led to a public health emergency of international concern, putting all health organizations on high alert in the beginning of 2020. Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is highly infectious and has resulted in thousands of deaths which exceeded that of the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) outbreak back in 2002 and 2003 in China. Besides, the number of diagnosed patients, patients who are suspected to have contracted the disease, and deaths are increasing worldwide. Unfortunately, effective drugs and vaccines to combat SARS-CoV-2 are still lacking. Convalescent plasma, a seemingly successful treatment for COVID-19 patients, proved to be of huge value in terms of saving severely ill patients. This review introduces the reported effects, potential mechanisms, and future uncertainties of convalescent plasma therapy in the treatment of COVID-19 patients, in the hopes that it will provide useful information for relevant physicians and researchers.
