36371983|a|BACKGROUND: Different methods for digestive tract reconstruction have a complex impact on the nutritional status of gastric cancer (GC) patients after radical gastrectomy. Previous studies reported that Roux-en-Y (R-Y) reconstruction resulted in obvious weight reduction and improvement in type 2 diabetes in obese patients. We investigated the relationship between R-Y reconstruction, gut microbiota, and the NLRP3 inflammasome in GC patients with poor basic nutrition. METHODS: Changes in the gut microbiota after radical gastrectomy accomplished by different methods of digestive tract reconstruction were investigated via fecal microbiota transplantation. The underlying mechanisms were also explored by analyzing the role of the microbiota, butyrate, and the NLRP3 inflammasome in the colon tissues of colitis model mice and GC patients after radical gastrectomy. FINDINGS: R-Y reconstruction effectively relieved intestinal inflammation and facilitated nutrient absorption. 16S rRNA analysis revealed that gavage transplantation with the fecal microbiota of R-Y reconstruction patients could reverse dysbacteriosis triggered by radical gastrectomy and elevate the relative abundance of some short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria. Subsequently, butyrate negatively regulated the NLRP3-mediated inflammatory signaling pathway to inhibit the activation of macrophages and the secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators such as caspase-1 and interleukin (IL)-1beta, decreasing the level of intestinal inflammation and promoting nutrient absorption. INTERPRETATION: R-Y reconstruction induced colonization with SCFA-producing bacteria to alleviate radical gastrectomy-induced colitis by down-regulating the NLRP3 signaling pathway. This can be a new strategy and theoretical basis for the management of the postoperative nutritional status of GC patients.
