35332198|a|Methionine restriction (MR) extends lifespan and improves several markers of health in rodents. However, the proximate mechanisms of MR on these physiological benefits have not been fully elucidated. The essential amino acid methionine plays numerous biological roles and limiting its availability in the diet directly modulates methionine metabolism. There is growing evidence that redox regulation of methionine has regulatory control on some aspects of cellular function but interactions with MR remain largely unexplored. We tested the functional role of the ubiquitously expressed methionine repair enzyme methionine sulfoxide reductase A (MsrA) on the metabolic benefits of MR in mice. MsrA catalytically reduces both free and protein-bound oxidized methionine, thus playing a key role in its redox state. We tested the extent to which MsrA is required for metabolic effects of MR in adult mice using mice lacking MsrA. As expected, MR in control mice reduced body weight, altered body composition, and improved glucose metabolism. Interestingly, lack of MsrA did not impair the metabolic effects of MR on these outcomes. Moreover, females had blunted MR responses regardless of MsrA status compared to males. Overall, our data suggests that MsrA is not required for the metabolic benefits of MR in adult mice.
