29442002|a|Damage caused by oxidative stress in cases of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's has been proven to be irreversible. However, diet supplementation of antioxidants can be beneficial to the total antioxidant status of the human body. Given that oxidative stress is a principal cause of neurodegenerative disease, effective natural antioxidants could provide therapeutic options for these disorders. Therefore we investigated the antioxidant properties of two natural extracts and five synthetic compounds in lipid rich environment of liposomes with oxidation induced by Fenton's reagent. Antioxidant activity has been quantified using the Klein peroxidation index and oxygen uptake. Both natural extracts from Acai berry and Ginseng as well as all synthetic compounds - N-acetyl-L-cysteine, tocopherol, huperzines, caffeic acid and lipoic acid displayed good antioxidants properties, which confirm their suitability as neuroprotective agents.
