39448944|a|BACKGROUND: Falls remain a persistent problem in residential aged care (RAC) facilities. Fall screening and assessment tools such as the Peninsula Health Falls Risk Assessment Tool (PHFRAT) are widely used to inform falls risk and guide fall prevention interventions. However, it is unclear how it is used in practice and whether clinicians believe it supports resident care. This study aimed to measure the extent of use of PHFRAT to understand clinicians' perceptions of its value and usefulness. METHODS: This mixed method study involved an analysis of PHFRAT assessment from 25 RAC facilities in New South Wales, Australia, and interviews with seven RAC staff about how PHFRAT information is used in practice. In the quantitative component, descriptive statistics were applied to PHFRAT data to summarise how RAC staff use the PHFRAT including the completeness and content of the three parts. In the qualitative component, thematic analysis techniques were applied to interview data. RESULTS: The sample included 215 RAC residents with 703 PHFRATs, of which 617 documented fall prevention interventions. Among these 617 PHFRATs, 593 (96.1%) included strategies related to staff assistance and 283 (45.9%) recorded strategies related to device provision. While nearly all residents (96.74%) received at least one PHFRAT assessment over the study period, many PHFRAT assessments were incomplete (part 1: 11.5% of information missing; part 2: 10.8%; part 3: 17.1%). There were few variations in fall interventions prescribed to individual residents by their fall risk level. Interviews with RAC staff indicated that PHFRAT assessments are the responsibility of registered nurses with limited input from other staff or residents. While the structured process was viewed positively in guiding risk assessment and intervention assessment, a lack of input from others prevented strategies from being tailored to residents' specific needs and preferences. A shortage of resources, lack of communication, and limited staff education were identified as the main barriers to PHFRAT guideline implementation. CONCLUSION: The PHFRAT provides a useful structure for clinicians to assess falls risk factors and plan falls prevention strategies. In the future, increased multidisciplinary input into fall prevention strategy development may improve the comprehensiveness of fall prevention plans.
