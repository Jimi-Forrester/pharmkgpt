39287471|t|Incidence and pattern of neurological emergencies in Ramadan.
39287471|a|BACKGROUND: The impact of Ramadan fasting on various neurological emergencies remains relatively unexplored. This study aimed to clarify the incidence and pattern of the different neurological emergencies in Ramadan compared to Shaaban. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, all adult patients attending the emergency room at two Egyptian centers with neurological emergencies during Shaaban and Ramadan were evaluated. Clinical, laboratory, and radiological assessments were made on an individual basis upon which the diagnosis of neurological disorder was made. IBM SPSS Version 25 was used to analyze the data. RESULTS: Seventy-twenty patients were included, 382 during Shaaban and 338 during Ramadan. Among causes of delirium, the frequency of dehydration was significantly higher, and the frequency of illicit drug abuse was significantly lower during Ramadan compared to Shaaban (P = 0.004, 0.030, respectively). The incidence of ICH was significantly reduced during Ramadan compared to Shaaban (10.8% vs 19.7%, P = 0.031). The incidence of cardioembolic strokes significantly increased during Ramadan than Shaaban (40.5% vs 26.4%, P = 0.014), whereas the incidence of small vessel disease (SVD) significantly decreased during Ramadan than Shaaban (21.6% vs. 42.1%, P < 0.001). The incidence of a single seizure was significantly higher in Ramadan than in Shaaban (69.4% vs. 34.6%, P = 0.007). The incidence of functional neurological disorders was significantly reduced in Ramadan than in Shaaban (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The incidence of delirium caused by illicit drug abuse, ICH, SVD, and functional neurological disorders declined during Ramadan, while the incidence of delirium triggered by dehydration, cardioembolic strokes, and a single seizure increased during Ramadan.
