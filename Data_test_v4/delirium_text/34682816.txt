34682816|a|Recent studies have highlighted the association between ocular diseases and microbiota profiles of the host intestinal tract and oral cavity. There is mounting evidence supporting the existence of a 'gut-eye axis', whereby changes in gut microbiome alter host immunity, with consequential implications for ocular health and disease. In this review, we examined recent published findings on the association between gut microbiome and ocular morbidity, based on 25 original articles published between 2011 to 2020. The review included both clinical and in vivo animal studies, with particular focus on the influence of the microbiome on host immunity and metabolism. Significant associations between altered intestinal microbiome and specific ocular diseases and pathological processes, including Behcet's syndrome, autoimmune uveitis, age-related macular degeneration, choroidal neovascularization, bacterial keratitis, and Sjogren-like lacrimal keratoconjunctivitis have been demonstrated. Furthermore, alterations in the gut microbiome resulted in quantifiable changes in the host immune response, suggesting immunopathogenesis as the basis for the link between intestinal dysbiosis and ocular disease. We also examined and compared different techniques used in the identification and quantification of gut microorganisms. With our enhanced understanding of the potential role of gut commensals in ophthalmic disease, the stage is set for further studies on the underlying mechanisms linking the gut microbiome, the host immune response, and the pathogenesis of ophthalmic disease.
