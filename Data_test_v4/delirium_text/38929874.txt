38929874|t|The Role of Oral Supplementation for the Management of Age-Related Macular Degeneration: A Narrative Review.
38929874|a|The majority of neurodegenerative eye disorders occur with aging and significantly impair quality of life. Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the third most common cause of visual impairment and blindness worldwide. One of the most important elements in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative eye disease is certainly oxidative stress, with neuroinflammation and ocular ischemia which may also be significant factors. Antioxidants, either by food or oral supplementation, may be able to mitigate the deleterious effects of reactive oxygen species that build as a result of oxidative stress, ischemia, and inflammation. Over the past few decades, a number of research works examining the potential adjuvant impact of antioxidants in AMD have been published. In fact, there is not only more and more interest in already known molecules but also in new molecules that can help clinicians in the management of this complex multifactorial disease, such as astaxanthin and melatonin. However, while some studies showed encouraging outcomes, others were conflicting. In addition, more and more attention is also being paid to nutrition, considered a pivotal key point, especially to prevent AMD. For this reason, the purpose of this review is to analyze the main antioxidant molecules currently used as oral supplements for AMD treatment, as well as the role of diet and food intake in this ocular disease, to better understand how all these factors can improve the clinical management of AMD patients.
