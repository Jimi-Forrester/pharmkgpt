METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in a neurology outpatient clinic. The TYM was administered to individuals of 50 years o more who came to the clinic for whatever the symptom. Their cognitive state was evaluated regardless of the outcome of TYM. They were categorized into 3 groups: 1) Cognitively normal (739), 2) with mild cognitive impairment (183), 3) with dementia (127). An analysis of items was made and the psychometric properties of the TYM were defined. There was a cross-validation, and the predictive validity of the TYM score, adjusted to the demographic variables, was determined by evaluating their performance in ROC curves. RESULTS: The internal consistency, interobserver reliability, short term and long-term test-retest reliability were adequate. The TYM correlated with the MMSE (r=0.779, P<.0001). The cross validation showed consistent results. With the TYM Score adjusted according to the educational level, a sensitivity of 0.86 with a specificity of 0.88 in the cut-off point of <=40/50 was obtained to identify subjects with cognitive impairment, and a sensitivity of 0.94 with a specificity of 0.89 in the cut-off point of <=36/50 to identify subjects with dementia. CONCLUSIONS: The TYM is a self-administered global cognitive test, possessing excellent psychometric properties and good predictive validity. It can be used as a cognitive screening test in subjects with 4 years or more of formal education.
