39582467|a|The identification of protective agents for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases is the mainstay therapeutic goal to modify the disease course and arrest the irreversible disability progression. Pharmacological therapies synergistically targeting multiple pathogenic pathways, including oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and inflammation, are prime candidates for neuroprotection. Combination or synergistic therapy with melatonin, whose decline correlates with altered sleep/wake cycle and impaired glymphatic "waste clearance" system in neurodegenerative diseases, has a great therapeutic potential to treat inflammatory neurodegenerative states. Despite the protective outcomes observed in preclinical studies, mild or poor outcomes were observed in clinical settings, suggesting that melatonin combinations promoting synergistic actions at appropriate doses might be more suitable to treat multifactorial neurodegenerative disorders. In this review, we first summarize the key melatonin actions and pathways contributing to cell protection and its therapeutic implication in Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and multiple sclerosis (MS). We remark the major controversies in the field, mostly generated by the lack of a common consensus for the optimal dosing, molecular targets, and toxicity. Then, we review the literature investigating the efficacy of melatonin combinations with approved or investigational neuroprotective agents and of melatonin-containing hybrid molecules, both in vitro and in animal models of AD, PD, and MS, as well as the efficacy of add-on melatonin in clinical settings. We highlight the rationale for such melatonin combinations with a focus on the comparison with single-agent treatment and on the assays in which an additive or a synergistic effect has been achieved. We conclude that a better characterization of the mechanisms underlying such melatonin synergistic actions under neuroinflammation at appropriate doses needs to be tackled to advance successful clinical translation of neuroprotective melatonin combination therapies or melatonin-based hybrid molecules.
