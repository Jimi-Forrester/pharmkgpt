37577456|t|The Role of C-to-U RNA Editing in Human Biodiversity.
37577456|a|Intra-organism biodiversity is thought to arise from epigenetic modification of our constituent genes and post-translational modifications after mRNA is translated into proteins. We have found that post-transcriptional modification, also known as RNA editing, is also responsible for a significant amount of our biodiversity, substantively expanding this story. The APOBEC (apolipoprotein B mRNA editing catalytic polypeptide-like) family RNA editing enzymes APOBEC3A and APOBEC3G catalyze the deamination of cytosines to uracils (C>U) in specific stem-loop structures. 1,2 We used RNAsee (RNA site editing evaluation), a tool developed to predict the locations of APOBEC3A/G RNA editing sites, to determine whether known single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in DNA could be replicated in RNA via RNA editing. About 4.5% of non-synonymous SNPs which result in C>U changes in RNA, and about 5.4% of such SNPs labelled as pathogenic, were identified as probable sites for APOBEC3A/G editing. This suggests that the variant proteins created by these DNA mutations may also be created by transient RNA editing, with the potential to affect human health. Those SNPs identified as potential APOBEC3A/G-mediated RNA editing sites were disproportionately associated with cardiovascular diseases, digestive system diseases, and musculoskeletal diseases. Future work should focus on common sites of RNA editing, any variant proteins created by these RNA editing sites, and the effects of these variants on protein diversity and human health. Classically, our biodiversity is thought to come from our constitutive genetics, epigenetic phenomenon, transcriptional differences, and post-translational modification of proteins. Here, we have shown evidence that RNA editing, often stimulated by environmental factors, could account for a significant degree of the protein biodiversity leading to human disease. In an era where worries about our changing environment are ever increasing, from the warming of our climate to the emergence of new diseases to the infiltration of microplastics and pollutants into our bodies, understanding how environmentally sensitive mechanisms like RNA editing affect our own cells is essential.
