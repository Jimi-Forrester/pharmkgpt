37107213|a|Morus bombycis has a long history of usage as a treatment for metabolic diseases, especially, diabetes mellitus (DM). Thus, we aimed to isolate and evaluate bioactive constituents derived from M. bombycis leaves for the treatment of DM. According to bioassay-guided isolation by column chromatography, eight compounds were obtained from M. bombycis leaves: two phenolic compounds, p-coumaric acid (1) and chlorogenic acid methyl ester (2), one stilbene, oxyresveratrol (3), two stilbene dimers, macrourin B (4) and austrafuran C (6), one 2-arylbenzofuran, moracin M (5), and two Diels-Alder type adducts, mulberrofuran F (7) and chalcomoracin (8). Among the eight isolated compounds, the anti-DM activity of 3-8 (which possess chemotaxonomic significance in Morus species) was evaluated by inhibition of alpha-glucosidase, protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), human recombinant aldose reductase (HRAR), and advanced glycation end-product (AGE) formation as well as by scavenging peroxynitrite (ONOO-), which are crucial therapeutic targets of DM and its complications. Compounds 4 and 6-8 significantly inhibited alpha-glucosidase, PTP1B, and HRAR enzymes with mixed-type and non-competitive-type inhibition modes. Furthermore, the four compounds had low negative binding energies in both enzymes according to molecular docking simulation, and compounds 3-8 exhibited strong antioxidant capacity by inhibiting AGE formation and ONOO- scavenging. Overall results suggested that the most active stilbene-dimer-type compounds (4 and 6) along with Diels-Alder type adducts (7 and 8) could be promising therapeutic and preventive resources against DM and have the potential to be used as antioxidants, anti-diabetic agents, and anti-diabetic complication agents.
