Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is regarded as a transitional stage in the progression from normal elderly individuals to patients with AD. While studies have identified abnormalities in brain connectivity in patients with MCI, including functional and structural connectivity, accurately identifying patients with MCI in clinical screening remains challenging. We hypothesized that utilizing machine learning (ML) based on both functional and structural connectivity could yield meaningful results in distinguishing between patients with MCI and normal elderly individuals, so as to provide valuable information for early diagnosis and precise evaluation of patients with MCI. METHODS: Following clinical criteria, we recruited 32 patients with MCI for the patient group, and 32 normal elderly individuals for the control group. All subjects underwent examinations for resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Subsequently, significant functional and structural connectivity features were selected and combined with a support vector machine for classification of the patient and control groups. RESULTS: We observed significantly different functional connectivity in the frontal lobe and putamen between the MCI group and normal controls. The results based on functional connectivity features demonstrated a classification accuracy of 71.88% and an area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.78. In terms of structural connectivity, we found that decreased fractional anisotropy in patients with MCI was significantly associated with Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores, specifically in regions such as the precuneus and cingulate gyrus. The classification results using the structural connectivity feature yielded an accuracy of 92.19% and an AUC value of 0.99. Lastly, combining functional and structural connectivity features resulted in a classification accuracy and AUC value of 93.75% and 0.99, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we demonstrated a high classification performance, underscoring the potential of both brain functional and structural connectivity in distinguishing patients with MCI from normal elderly individuals. Furthermore, the integration of functional connectivity and structural connectivity features indicated that utilizing rs-fMRI and DTI could enhance the accuracy and specificity of identifying patients with MCI compared with relying on a single neuroimaging technique.
