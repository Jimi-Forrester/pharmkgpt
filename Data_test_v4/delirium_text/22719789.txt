22719789|t|The Components of Flemingia macrophylla Attenuate Amyloid beta-Protein Accumulation by Regulating Amyloid beta-Protein Metabolic Pathway.
22719789|a|Flemingia macrophylla (Leguminosae) is a popular traditional remedy used in Taiwan as anti-inflammatory, promoting blood circulation and antidiabetes agent. Recent study also suggested its neuroprotective activity against Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, the effects of F. macrophylla on Abeta production and degradation were studied. The effect of F. macrophylla on Abeta metabolism was detected using the cultured mouse neuroblastoma cells N2a transfected with human Swedish mutant APP (swAPP-N2a cells). The effects on Abeta degradation were evaluated on a cell-free system. An ELISA assay was applied to detect the level of Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42. Western blots assay was employed to measure the levels of soluble amyloid precursor protein and insulin degrading enzyme (IDE). Three fractions of F. macrophylla modified Abeta accumulation by both inhibiting beta-secretase and activating IDE. Three flavonoids modified Abeta accumulation by activating IDE. The activated IDE pool by the flavonoids was distinctly regulated by bacitracin (an IDE inhibitor). Furthermore, flavonoid 94-18-13 also modulates Abeta accumulation by enhancing IDE expression. In conclusion, the components of F. macrophylla possess the potential for developing new therapeutic drugs for Alzheimer's disease.
