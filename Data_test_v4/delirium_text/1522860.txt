1522860|a|Delirium patients were often admitted to a psychiatric hospital in the past. This practise has to stop. Delirium is an illness which is caused by an organic factor, and in some cases, such as delirium tremens, there is a 5% mortality rate. If the causative factor is identified and rectified, and effective sedation is administered, the delirium patient should not be a problem for nursing staff to handle. A few simple, practical guidelines followed by the nursing staff can help the delirium patient recover within a week.
