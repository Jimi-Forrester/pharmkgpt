36089740|a|AIMS: We mainly evaluate retinal alterations in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, investigate the associations between retinal changes with AD biomarkers, and explore an optimal machine learning (ML) model for AD diagnosis based on retinal thickness. METHODS: A total of 159 AD patients and 299 healthy controls were enrolled. The retinal parameters of each participant were measured using optical coherence tomography (OCT). Additionally, cognitive impairment severity, brain atrophy, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers were measured in AD patients. RESULTS: AD patients demonstrated a significant decrease in the average, superior, and inferior quadrant peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer, macular retinal nerve fiber layer, ganglion cell layer (GCL), inner plexiform layer (IPL) thicknesses, as well as total macular volume (TMV) (all p < 0.05). Moreover, TMV was positively associated with Mini-Mental State Examination and Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores, IPL thickness was correlated negatively with the medial temporal lobe atrophy score, and the GCL thickness was positively correlated with CSF Abeta42 /Abeta40 and negatively associated with p-tau level. Based on the significantly decreased OCT variables between both groups, the XGBoost algorithm exhibited the best diagnostic performance for AD, whose four references, including accuracy, area under the curve, f1 score, and recall, ranged from 0.69 to 0.74. Moreover, the macular retinal thickness exhibited an absolute superiority for AD diagnosis compared with other enrolled variables in all ML models. CONCLUSION: We identified the retinal alterations in AD patients and found that macular thickness and volume were associated with AD severity and biomarkers. Furthermore, we confirmed that OCT combined with ML could serve as a potential diagnostic tool for AD.
