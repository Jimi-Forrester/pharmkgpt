10610719|t|Molecular characterization of zyme/protease M/neurosin (PRSS9), a hormonally regulated kallikrein-like serine protease.
10610719|a|The cDNA for the zyme/protease M/neurosin gene (HGMW-approved symbol PRSS9) has recently been identified. Zyme appears to play a role in Alzheimer disease as well as in breast cancer. In this paper, we describe the complete genomic organization of the zyme gene. Zyme spans 10.5 kb of genomic sequence on chromosome 19q13.3-q13.4. The gene consists of seven exons, the first two of which are untranslated. All splice junctions follow the GT/AG rule, and the intron phases are identical to those of many other genes belonging to the same family, i.e., the kallikreins, NES1, and neuropsin. Fine-mapping of the genomic locus indicates that zyme lies upstream of the NES1 gene and downstream from the PSA and KLK2 genes. Tissue expression studies indicate that zyme is expressed mainly in brain tissue, including spinal cord and cerebellum, in mammary gland, and in kidney and uterus. Zyme is regulated by steroid hormones in the breast carcinoma cell line BT-474. Estrogens and progestins, and to a lesser extent androgens, up-regulate the zyme gene in a dose-dependent manner.
