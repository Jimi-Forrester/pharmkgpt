15312961|t|Cognitive impairment in PDAPP mice depends on ApoE and ACT-catalyzed amyloid formation.
15312961|a|Biochemical and genetic studies indicate that the inflammatory proteins, apolipoprotein E (ApoE) and alpha(1)-antichymotrypsin (ACT) are important in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Using several lines of multiply transgenic/knockout mice we show here that murine ApoE and human ACT separately and synergistically facilitate both diffuse A beta immunoreactive and fibrillar amyloid deposition and thus also promote cognitive impairment in aged PDAPP(V717F) mice. The degree of cognitive impairment is highly correlated with the ApoE- and ACT-dependent hippocampal amyloid burden, with PDAPP mice lacking ApoE and ACT having little amyloid and little learning disability. A analysis of young mice before the onset of amyloid formation shows that steady-state levels of monomeric A beta peptide are unchanged by ApoE or ACT. These data suggest that the process or product of amyloid formation is more critical than monomeric A beta for the neurological decline in AD, and that the risk factors ApoE and ACT participate primarily in disease processes downstream of APP processing.
