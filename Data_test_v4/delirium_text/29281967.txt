29281967|a|BACKGROUND: Obesity induced brain inflammation is associated with cognitive disorders. We aimed to investigate the influence of vitamin D on hypothalamus and hippocampus inflammatory response in high-fat diet induced obese rats. METHODS: In the beginning of the study, 40 rats were divided into two groups: control diet and high fat diet (HFD) for 16 weeks; then each group subdivided into two groups including: N, ND + vitamin D, HFD and HFD + vitamin D. Vitamin D supplementation was done for 5 weeks at 500 IU/kg dosage. IL-6, IL-1beta, NF-Kbeta and acetylcholine (ACH) and brain derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) concentrations in hippocampus and hypothalamus homogenate samples were measured by commercial ELISA kits. RESULTS: Vitamin D administration, reduced food intake and weight gain in studied groups (P < 0.001). Vitamin D reduced hippocampus acetylcholine concentrations in ND + vitamin D group (P < 0.001). High fat diet increased hippocampus IL-6 concentrations significantly (P < 0.05) compared with normal diet receiving groups. Vitamin D could not have significant effects on IL-6 concentrations. Vitamin D administrations reduced IL-1beta, NF-Kbeta and acetylcholine concentration and BDNF concentrations in ND + vitamin D compared with ND group. These reductions were not significant in HFD + vitamin D versus HFD group. CONCLUSION: According to our results, vitamin D reduced food intake and weight gain and modulated the HFD induced inflammatory response in hippocampus and hypothalamus of high fat diet induced obesity. Therefore, this neurosteroid, can be suggested as a supplemental therapeutic tool in prevention of obesity related cognitive and neurodegenerative problems.
