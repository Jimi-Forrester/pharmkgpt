36474697|a|Objective: One of the most common complications in general anesthesia is the Emergence delirium (ED). Many agents have been studied for prevention of ED, among which propofol has been successfully used. However, there is no information about the optimal dosage of this agent considering the ultimate outcome and the adverse effects; therefore, aimed to assess in this study. Method : 70 children undergoing general anesthesia using propofol, fentanyl, and atracurium were assessed. Participants were allocated randomly to treatment with either propofol 1 mg/kg (n = 35) or 0.5 mg/kg (n = 35) by the end of the anesthesia. The Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium (PAED) Scale, Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability (FLACC) scale, and the University of Michigan Sedation Scale (UMSS) were assessed by 10-minute intervals. Post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) stay and adverse effects were registered and compared as well. Results: Duration of PACU stay (P < 0.001), PAED (P = 0.001), and UMSS (P = 0.003) were remarkably lower among low-dose propofol-treated children in the assessment at the 30th minute, while there were no significant differences in FLACC scores between the groups (P > 0.05). Apnea was found in a patient (2.85%) treated with high-dose propofol and decreased oxygen saturation was demonstrated in 5 (14.28%) and 2 (5.71%) participants in high- versus low-dose propofol. None of the patients experienced postoperative nausea and vomiting. Conclusion: Based on the current study, propofol 0.5 mg/kg by the end of anesthesia could efficiently prevent ED incidence and reduce time of PACU stay and adverse effects compared to a high dose of 1 mg/kg.
