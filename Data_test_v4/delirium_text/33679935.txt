33679935|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Subjective memory complaints (SMCs) are suggested to predict dementia at a very early stage. However, association of SMCs with known risk factors of dementia namely diabetes mellitus Type-2 diabetes and hypertension (HTN) remain unexplored which is the main aim of this study. The objective of the study was to investigate the association of SMC with diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2) and hypertension (HTN). METHODS: The associations of diabetes and hypertension, with SMCs has been tested in 500 participants from a tertiary care hospital of Karachi during 2017. Diagnosed cases of diabetes and hypertension were included through convenient sampling. Healthy attendants of patients were interviewed for the reference group. SMCs were assessed through a 14-item SMC questionnaire. RESULTS: Sample included 114 patients with only diabetes and hypertension each, 103 with both diabetes and hypertension and 169 healthy participants. Compared to healthy adults, persons with diabetes and hypertension had higher SMCs (difference, 0.88, 95% CI: 0.22, 1.54) (difference, 1.06, 95% CI: 0.40, 1.71) respectively, in fully adjusted models. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to healthy adults of working age-group, persons with diabetes and hypertension were more likely to have SMCs. Assessment and early detection of SMCs in persons with diabetes and hypertension might be informative to provide a window for effective interventions to maintain cognitive health.
