9833399|a|The number and distribution of Alzheimer type I and II cells (Alz I and II) as well as Opalski cells (Opl) were estimated in chosen brain regions of seven autopsied cases with Wilson's disease (WD). The authors of this study focused especially on the question whether the kind and intensity of astrocytes is linked to the clinical form of the disease and to the intensity of brain damage. Alz I and II cells were counted by the use of the HE method, whereas the number of Opl cells was calculated using the PAS method. The study revealed that among the three types of cells the number of Alz II cells was the highest and that of Alz I cells was the lowest. The distributional patterns of these three types of cells were different. Alz I cells were found mainly in the putamen. Alz II cells were observed diffusely, although they occurred in different numbers in the whole brain. The highest number of Opl cells was found in the putamen. Alz I cells were found only in the neurological type of the disease. The highest number of Alz II cells was seen in the hepatic type of the disease, whereas the highest number of Opl cells was observed in the neurological "mixed" forms. Moreover, intensity of tissue damage with presence of necroses was greatest in neurological WD. In the hepatic type dispersed areas of status spongiosus were observed, without presence of necroses. Our study revealed that the type and amount of the pathological astroglia may correlate both with the clinical form of WD and intensity of tissue damage. Alz II cells seem to be a characteristic feature of the early stage of astroglial response to the pathogenic factor whereas Alz I and Opl cells occur in WD only in the advanced stage of tissue damage.
