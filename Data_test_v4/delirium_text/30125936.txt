30125936|a|alpha-Synuclein is the major component of Lewy bodies and a candidate biomarker for neurodegenerative diseases in which Lewy bodies are common, including Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies. A large body of literature suggests that these disorders are characterized by reduced concentrations of alpha-synuclein in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), with overlapping concentrations compared to healthy controls and variability across studies. Several reasons can account for this variability, including technical ones, such as inter-assay and inter-laboratory variation (reproducibility). We compared four immunochemical methods for the quantification of alpha-synuclein concentration in 50 unique CSF samples. All methods were designed to capture most of the existing alpha-synuclein forms in CSF ('total' alpha-synuclein). Each of the four methods showed high analytical precision, excellent correlation between laboratories (R2 0.83-0.99), and good correlation with each other (R2 0.64-0.93), although the slopes of the regression lines were different between the four immunoassays. The use of common reference CSF samples decreased the differences in alpha-synuclein concentration between detection methods and technologies. Pilot data on an immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry (IP-MS) method is also presented. Our results suggest that the four immunochemical methods and the IP-MS method measure similar forms of alpha-synuclein and that a common reference material would allow harmonization of results between immunoassays.
