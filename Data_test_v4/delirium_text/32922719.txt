To investigate microbiota-gut-brain axis biochemical pathways, in this work we developed an innovative device to be used as modular unit in an engineered multi-organ-on-a-chip platform recapitulating in vitro the main players of the microbiota-gut-brain axis, and an innovative three-dimensional model of brain cells based on collagen/hyaluronic acid or collagen/poly(ethylene glycol) semi-interpenetrating polymer networks and beta-amyloid precursor protein-Swedish mutant-expressing H4 cells, to simulate the pathological scenario of Alzheimer's disease. We set up the culturing conditions, assessed cell response, scaled down the three-dimensional models to be hosted in the organ-on-a-chip device, and cultured them both in static and in dynamic conditions. The results suggest that the device and three-dimensional models are exploitable for advanced engineered models representing brain features also in Alzheimer's disease scenario.
