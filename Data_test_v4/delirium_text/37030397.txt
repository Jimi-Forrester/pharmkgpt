37030397|a|BACKGROUND: The present study aims to compare the hemodynamic profile of lidocaine and fentanyl during propofol induction of general anesthesia. METHODS: This randomized controlled trial included patients aged above 60 years undergoing elective non-cardiac surgery. The included patients either received 1 mg/kg lidocaine (n = 50) or 1 mcg/kg fentanyl (n = 50) based on total body weight with propofol induction of anesthesia. Patient's hemodynamics were recorded every minute for the first 5 min then every 2 min until 15 min after induction of anesthesia. Hypotension (mean arterial pressure [MAP] <65 mmHg or >30% reduction from baseline) was treated by intravenous 4 mcg bolus of norepinephrine. Outcomes included norepinephrine requirement (primary), the incidence of postinduction hypotension, MAP, heart rate, intubation condition, and postoperative delirium via the cognitive assessment method. RESULTS: Forty-seven patients in the lidocaine group and 46 patients in the fentanyl group were analyzed. None in the lidocaine group experienced hypotension, while 28/46 (61%) of patients in the fentanyl group developed at least one episode of hypotension requiring a median (25th and 75th quartiles) norepinephrine dose of 4 (0,5) mcg, p-value <0.001 for both outcomes. The average MAP was lower in the fentanyl group than in the lidocaine group at all time points after anesthesia induction. The average heart rate was comparable between the two groups nearly at all time points after anesthesia induction. The overall intubation condition was comparable between the two groups. None of the included patients developed postoperative delirium. CONCLUSION: Lidocaine-based regimen for induction of anesthesia reduced the risk of postinduction hypotension in older patients compared to the fentanyl-based regimen.
