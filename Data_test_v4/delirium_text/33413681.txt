33413681|a|BACKGROUND: Benign and malignant renal tumors share similar some imaging findings. METHODS: Sixty-six patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CCRCC), 13 patients with renal angiomyolipoma with minimal fat (RAMF) and 7 patients with renal oncocytoma (RO) were examined. For diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI), respiratory triggered echo-planar imaging sequences were acquired in axial plane (3 b-values: 0, 500, 1000s/mm2). Mean Diffusivity (MD), fractional Anisotropy (FA), mean kurtosis (MK), kurtosis anisotropy (KA) and radial kurtosis (RK) were performed. RESULTS: For MD, a significant higher value was shown in CCRCC (3.08 +- 0.23) than the rest renal tumors (2.93 +- 0.30 for RO, 1.52 +- 0.24 for AML, P < 0.05). The MD values were higher for RO than for AML (2.93 +- 0.30 vs.1.52 +- 0.24, P < 0.05), while comparable MD values were found between CCRCC and RO (3.08 +- 0.23 vs. 2.93 +- 0.30, P > 0.05). For MK, KA and RK, a significant higher value was shown in AML (1.32 +- 0.16, 1.42 +- 0.23, 1.41 +- 0.29) than CCRCC (0.43 +- 0.08, 0.57 +- 0.16, 0.37 +- 0.11) and RO (0.81 +- 0.08, 0.86 +- 0.16, 0.69 +- 0.08) (P < 0.05). The MK, KA and RK values were higher for RO than for CCRCC (0.81 +- 0.08 vs. 0.43 +- 0.08, 0.86 +- 0.16 vs. 0.57 +- 0.16, 0.69 +- 0.08 vs. 0.37 +- 0.11, P < 0.05). Using MD values of 2.86 as the threshold value for differentiating CCRCC from RO and AML, the best result obtained had a sensitivity of 76.1%, specificity of 72.6%. Using MK, KA and RK values of 1.19,1.13 and 1.11 as the threshold value for differentiating AML from CCRCC and RO, the best result obtained had a sensitivity of 91.2, 86.7, 82.1%, and specificity of 86.7, 83.2, 72.8%. CONCLUSION: DKI can be used as another noninvasive biomarker for benign and malignant renal tumors' differential diagnosis.
