35337125|t|Association between Proton Pump Inhibitor Use and Parkinson's Disease in a Korean Population.
35337125|a|Few studies have shown an increased risk of Parkinson's disease (PD) with the use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), and the pathophysiological mechanism for this association has not been unveiled. This study examined the relationship between PPI use and PD in a Korean population. We investigated 3026 PD patients and 12,104 controls who were matched by age, sex, income, and region of residence at a ratio of 1:4 in the Korean National Health Insurance Service, National Sample Cohort between 2002 and 2015. We estimated the associations between current and past use of PPIs and PD using odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) in a conditional/unconditional logistic regression after adjusting for probable confounders. Compared with PPI nonusers, both current users and past users had significantly greater odds of having PD, with ORs of 1.63 (95% CI = 1.44-1.84) and 1.12 (95% CI = 1.01-1.25), respectively. A significant association with PD was observed in individuals who used PPIs for 30-90 days and >=90 days (OR = 1.26 and 1.64, 95% CI = 1.12-1.43 and 1.43-1.89) but not among those who used PPIs for <30 days. Both current and past use of PPIs associated with a higher probability of PD in the Korean population. Our study provides evidence regarding the association between PPI exposure and PD, but further investigation and possible explanations are warranted.
