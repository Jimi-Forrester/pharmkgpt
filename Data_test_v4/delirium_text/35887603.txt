35887603|a|NAFLD is the most common cause of abnormality in liver function tests. NAFLD is considered a potential cardiovascular risk factor and is linked to cardiovascular risk factors such as obesity, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and dyslipidemia. Few previous studies have investigated whether NAFLD could be independently associated with cognitive impairment. The current study aims to find a possible role of NAFLD in the development of subcortical vascular dementia (sVaD). We considered NAFLD as a possible independent vascular risk factor or, considering its metabolic role, associated with other commonly accepted sVaD risk factors, i.e., lack of folate, vitamin B12, and vitamin D-OH25, and increased levels of homocysteine. We studied 319 patients diagnosed with sVaD. All patients underwent an abdominal ultrasound examination to classify steatosis into four levels (1-none up to 4-severe). sVaD patients were divided into two groups according to the presence or absence of NAFLD. Our results demonstrated a strong correlation between NAFLD and sVaD. Patients with the two comorbidities had worse neuropsychological outcomes and a worse metabolic profile. We also found a robust relationship between NAFLD and severe vitamin B12, folate, vitamin D hypovitaminosis, and higher hyperhomocysteinemia levels. This way, it is evident that NAFLD contributes to a more severe metabolic pathway. However, the strong relationship with the three parameters (B12, folate and vitamin D, and homocysteinemia) suggests that NAFLD can contribute to a proinflammatory condition.
