26270627|t|Resting state in Parkinson's disease dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies: commonalities and differences.
26270627|a|OBJECTIVE: Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) are two dementias with overlapping phenotypes. Clinically, these are differentiated by the one-year precedence rule between the onset of dementia with respect to Parkinsonism. In this report we aimed to find differences between DLB and PDD in functional connectivity (FC) using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging, which we hypothesised would reflect the underlying pathological differences between DLB and PDD. METHODS: The study cohort comprised of 18 patients with DLB, 12 with PDD and 17 healthy control (HC) groups. Eight cortical and four subcortical seeds were chosen, and time series extracted to estimate correlation maps. We also implemented a voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis to assess regional grey matter differences. FC analysis was corrected for age, sex and regional grey matter differences. RESULTS: The FC analysis showed greater alterations in DLB than in PDD for seeds placed within the fronto-parietal network (FPN), whilst in contrast, for the supplementary motor area seed FC alterations were more apparent in PDD than in DLB. However, when comparing DLB and PDD, no significant differences were found. In addition, VBM analysis revealed greater atrophy in PDD than HC and DLB in the bilateral motor cortices and precuneus respectively. CONCLUSIONS: PDD and DLB demonstrate similar FC alterations in the brain. However, attention- and motor-related seeds revealed subtle differences between both conditions when compared with HC, which may relate to the neuropathology and chronological precedence of core symptoms in the Lewy body dementias.
