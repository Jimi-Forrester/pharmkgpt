35206030|t|Vine Shoots as a Source of Trans-Resveratrol and epsilon-Viniferin: A Study of 23 Italian Varieties.
35206030|a|Stilbenes are a family of phenolic secondary metabolites that are known for their important roles in plant protection and human health. Numerous studies show that vine shoots, one of the most abundant winery wastes, could be used as a source of bioactive compounds such as stilbenes. The predominant stilbenoids in vine shoots are trans-resveratrol (Rsv) and epsilon-viniferin (Vf), whose content varies depending on numerous intrinsic and extrinsic factors. The present work investigates the influence of pre-treatment and variety on stilbene concentration in vine shoots. Vine shoots of the Primitivo and Negroamaro varieties were submitted to four different trials before stilbene extraction (untreated, dried at 50  C for 24 h, dried at 70  C for 15 min, and dried at 80  C for 10 min). The results showed that the heat pre-treatments had a slight impact on the total phenol and stilbene content. In contrast, the variety variable had a stronger impact on stilbene concentration, ranging from 2700 to 6400 mg kg-1 DW for untreated vine shoots of 23 Italian varieties. In all vine shoots, the most abundant stilbene compound was Rsv and the highest content was found in vine shoots of the Nero di Troia (5298.1 mg kg-1 DW) and Negroamaro (5249.4 mg kg-1 DW) varieties.
