8585436|t|[Time in neuropsychological examination of dementias: Alzheimer's disease versus Parkinson disease].
8585436|a|The importance of time factor studying specificity and sensitivity of neuropsychological tests was studied in two groups of patients with Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease with their respective control groups, through a discriminant analysis. The results indicate that patients with Parkinson's disease are detected with mor sensitivity and specificity applying tests that control time. These findings suggest to develop bradyphrenia and frontal syndrome terms in Parkinson's disease.
