37197461|t|Synthesis of Veliparib Prodrugs and Determination of Drug-Release-Dependent PARP-1 Inhibition.
37197461|a|Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) plays a key role in repairing DNA damage, and several PARP inhibitors have been approved as treatments in BRCA1/2 mutated breast and ovarian cancers. Mounting evidence also supports their application as neuroprotective agents since PARP overactivation compromises the mitochondrial homeostasis by consumption of NAD+ reserves, leading to an increase in reactive oxygen and nitrogen species and a spike in intracellular Ca2+ levels. Herein, we present the synthesis and preliminary evaluation of new mitochondria-targeting PARP inhibitor prodrugs of (+-)-veliparib, with the goal to advance potential neuroprotective properties without impairing the repair of damaged DNA in the nucleus.
