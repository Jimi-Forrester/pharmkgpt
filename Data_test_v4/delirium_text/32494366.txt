It is set to be the biggest killer among the growing elderly population. The aim of this study was to assess the knowledge of Alzheimer's disease among college students in Kathmandu metropolitan city. METHODS: This was a descriptive cross-sectional study among 385 randomly selected bachelor students of Kathmandu metropolitan city. The questionnaire included 2 sections. Section I addressed the sociodemographic characteristics of the participants. Section II addressed or covered the Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Scale (ADKS) test. ADKS contains a set of 30 items, with true and false options. 1 point was given for the correct answer and 0 for the incorrect answer. The final sum was then the total score of the participant. Frequency, percentage, mean, and standard deviation were calculated, and the chi-square test was used to measure the association between two categorical variables. RESULTS: The mean ADKS (Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Scale) score is 15.45 +- 2.95 with the lowest and highest mean total scores of 8 and 26, respectively. 49.5% of the respondents scored above the mean. The number of male and female respondents who scored above the mean is 68 and 95, respectively, with p value 0.71 and odds ratio 0.922. There is no association between gender and knowledge level. Gender seemed to have no effect on the knowledge about Alzheimer's disease on the basis of the Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Scale (ADKS). However, science students had comparatively better knowledge about disease than management students. The mean score of science and management is 15.9 and 15.04, respectively, with p value 0.004. There is association between knowledge score and faculty. CONCLUSION: This study concluded that the knowledge level of college students on Alzheimer's disease is below moderate. The findings concluded that there is association between faculty and knowledge score.
