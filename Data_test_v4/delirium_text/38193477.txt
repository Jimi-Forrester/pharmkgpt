38193477|a|INTRODUCTION: Monoclonal antibodies targeting amyloid-beta are the first disease-modifying treatments for Alzheimer disease to have received FDA-approval. There are three different drugs approved or pending FDA-approval: aducanumab, lecanemab, and donanemab. These three drugs are each in different stages of regulatory approval by the FDA. AREAS COVERED: We discuss the development of these drugs, the data regarding their clinical efficacy, their dosing regimens, and side effects. In addition, we examine pragmatic issues with their potential implementation as common treatments to slow the rate of decline in Alzheimer disease, and what unanswered questions remain regarding this new class of drugs. EXPERT OPINION: We conclude that these new monoclonal antibodies that target amyloid-beta represent a genuine advance in the treatment of Alzheimer disease. However, questions remain regarding their clinical significance. Additionally, it is presently unclear which patients would most benefit from these expensive drugs given the risk of side effects and the logistical difficulties concerning administration and the determination of eligibility.
