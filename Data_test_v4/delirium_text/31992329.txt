31992329|a|INTRODUCTION: In the USA, energy drinks are commonly consumed among adults. The side effects of these drinks are not well studied but consumers have reported multiple adverse events to the US Food and Drug Administration including acute kidney injury and acute hepatitis. CASE PRESENTATION: A 62-year-old white woman presented with progressive weakness, fatigue, confusion, and delirium secondary to acute kidney injury and acute hepatitis associated with excessive energy drink use. Clinical improvement occurred with supportive care and discontinuation of energy drinks, with resolution of acute kidney injury and progressive improvement of liver function. The defined mechanism of injury is unknown but thought due to energy drink ingredients. CONCLUSION: Multiple cases of energy drink-induced acute kidney injury or acute hepatitis are reported in the literature but this case is the first to report them simultaneously. Ingredients and presumed doses to cause these events are outlined in this case report.
