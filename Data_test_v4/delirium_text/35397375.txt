35397375|t|Exploring the efficacy and contribution of Dupilumab in asthma management.
35397375|a|IgG4 monoclonal antibody Dupilumab binds to the alpha chain (IL4R) of both types of the ligand-binding domains (IL4R/ IL13R1; equally IL4 and IL13 specific) of the IL-4 receptor. The current focus on precision medicine techniques to blocking pathways implicated in allergy disorders is crucial to the development of Dupilumab and broadening its therapeutic uses. Our review describes how the IL-4R complexes signaling pathway works, explores the probable mechanisms of Dupilumab activity and addresses its clinical usefulness and safety in asthma. The FDA (Food and Drug Administration) already licences it to treat Alzheimer's disease and moderate-to-severe asthma, and it has shown highly significant results in the management of chronic rhinosinusitis and Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). Previous investigations and clinical trials undertaken by various pharmaceutical firms are examined in this review article to assess the existing literature fully. The discovery of Dupilumab and the expanding range of therapeutic uses are pertinent to the current focus on precision medicine methods to blocking asthma-related pathways.
