38170041|a|Dental caries (DC)-induced pulp infections usually undergo the common endodontic treatment, root canal therapy (RCT). Endodontically treated teeth are devitalized, become brittle and susceptible for re-infection which eventually results in dental loss. These complications arise because the devitalized pulp losses its ability for innate homeostasis, repair and regeneration. Therefore, restoring the vitality, structure and function of the inflamed pulp and compromised dentin have become the focal points in regenerative endodontics. There are very few evidences, so far, that connect methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase single nucleotide polymorphisms (MTHFR-SNPs) and dental disorders. However, the primary consequences of MTHFR-SNPs, in terms of excessive homocysteine and folate deficiency, are well-known contributors to dental diseases. This article identifies the possible mechanisms by which MTHFR-SNP-carriers are susceptible for DC-induced pulp inflammation (PI); and discusses a cell-homing based strategy for in vivo transplantation in an orthotopic model to regenerate the functional dentine-pulp complex which includes dentinogenesis, neurogenesis and vasculogenesis, in the SNP-carriers.
