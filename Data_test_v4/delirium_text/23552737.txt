23552737|a|Carcinogenesis and cancer progression, driven by mutations in oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes, result in biological differences between normal and cancer cells in various cellular processes. Specific genes and signaling molecules involved in such cellular processes may be potential therapeutic targets of agents that specifically interact with the key factors in cancer cells. Increased glucose uptake is fundamental to many solid tumors and well associated with increases in glycolysis and the overexpression of glucose transporters (GLUTs) such as GLUT1 and GLUT3 at the plasma membrane. Here, we used cell-based screening to identify glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) inhibitors that selectively target GLUT3-expressing tumorigenic HeLa cell hybrids as compared with non-tumorigenic hybrids that express GLUT1 alone. The GSK-3 inhibitors as well as GSK-3beta RNAi suppressed GLUT3 expression at the level of transcription, leading to apoptosis. This suppression was associated with NF-kappaB in a p53-independent manner. Furthermore, GSK-3 inhibitors exhibited a synergistic effect with anticancer agents such as adriamycin and camptothecin in GULT3-overexpressing colon cancer cells, but little effect in non-producing A431 cells. These results suggest a potential use of GSK-3 inhibitors to selectively kill cancer cells that overexpress GLUT3.
