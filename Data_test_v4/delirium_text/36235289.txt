36235289|t|Highly Sensitive, Robust, and Recyclable TiO2/AgNP Substrate for SERS Detection.
36235289|a|Label-free biosensors provide an important platform for detecting chemical and biological substances without needing extra labeling agents. Unlike surface-based techniques such as surface plasmon resonance (SPR), interference, and ellipsometry, surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) possesses the advantage of monitoring analytes both on surfaces and in solutions. Increasing the SERS enhancement is crucial to preparing high-quality substrates without quickly losing their stability, sensitivity, and repeatability. However, fabrication methods based on wet chemistry, nanoimprint lithography, spark discharge, and laser ablation have drawbacks of waste of time, complicated processes, or nonreproducibility in surface topography. This study reports the preparation of recyclable TiO2/Ag nanoparticle (AgNP) substrates by using simple arc ion plating and direct-current (dc) magnetron sputtering technologies. The deposited anatase-phased TiO2 ensured the photocatalytic degradation of analytes. By measuring the Raman spectra of rhodamine 6G (R6G) in titrated concentrations, a limit of detection (LOD) of 10-8 M and a SERS enhancement factor (EF) of 1.01 x 109 were attained. Self-cleaning was performed via UV irradiation, and recyclability was achieved after at least five cycles of detection and degradation. The proposed TiO2/AgNP substrates have the potential to serve as eco-friendly SERS enhancers for label-free detection of various chemical and biological substances.
