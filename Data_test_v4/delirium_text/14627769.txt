14627769|t|Delirium in children and adolescents.
14627769|a|Rarely reported in pediatric patients, the characteristic symptoms and course of delirium are well known in adults. This retrospective study was undertaken to describe the clinical presentation, symptoms, and outcome of delirium in children and adolescents. Eighty-four patients age 6 months to 18 years were identified with delirium, from 1,027 consecutive psychiatric consultations during a 4-year period. Mortality was high (20%), and length of stay was prolonged. Symptoms of psychosis and disorientation were less characteristic, but overall the presentation and course of delirium were similar to adults, and the current Diagnostic and Standard Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) criteria were found applicable in the pediatric population.
