35086341|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether diagnostic agreement and concordance between non-psychiatric (medical and surgical) doctors and consultation-liaison psychiatry changes within junior doctors' terms. METHOD: This was a retrospective cohort analysis of referrals from medical and surgical units to a consultation-liaison psychiatry service. Diagnostic agreement was calculated across all diagnoses and expressed as a percentage. Diagnostic concordance (expressed using Cohen's Kappa) was calculated for the two most common diagnoses of depression and delirium. Diagnostic agreement and concordance in the first two weeks (Timepoint A) were compared to those in the last two weeks (Timepoint B) of junior doctors' terms. RESULTS: Around half the referrals (Timepoint A = 48.1%, Timepoint B = 54.0%) were excluded as no diagnosis was listed.Diagnostic agreement over all diagnoses was 31.7% (Timepoint A) and 29.9% (Timepoint B) and was not statistically different. Diagnostic concordance for depression increased from fair to moderate but was not statistically significant. Diagnostic concordance for delirium was substantial for both timepoints and were not statistically different. CONCLUSIONS: No statistically significant change in diagnostic accuracy over a junior doctors' term was found in this study.
