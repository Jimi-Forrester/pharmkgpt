36793951|a|Objective: 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF) is an important component of air pollution, confirmed to be a risk factor for pulmonary inflammation. However, its association with general health is unknown. This article aimed to clarify the effect and mechanism of 5-HMF in the occurrence and aggravation of frailty in mice by investigating whether exposure to 5-HMF was linked to the occurrence and aggravation of mice frailty. Methods: Twelve male C57BL/6 mice (12-month-old, 38 +- 1 g) were randomly divided into the control group and the 5-HMF group. The 5-HMF group was treated with 5-HMF (1 mg/kg/day, respiratory exposure) for 12 months, whereas the control group was treated with equal amounts of sterile water. After the intervention, the ELISA method was used to detect the serum inflammation level of the mice, and the physical performance and frail status were evaluated using a Fried physical phenotype-based assessment tool. The differences in the body compositions were calculated from their MRI images, and the pathological changes in their gastrocnemius muscle were revealed using the H&E staining. Furthermore, the senescence of skeletal muscle cells was evaluated by measuring the expression levels of senescence-related proteins by the western blotting. Results: In the 5-HMF group, serum inflammatory factors IL-6, TNF-alpha, and CRP levels were significantly raised (p < 0.01). Mice in this group had higher frailty scores and significantly reduced grip strength (p < 0.001), slower weight gains, less WVgastrocnemius muscle masses, and lower sarcopenia indices (SI). In addition, the cross-sectional areas of their skeletal muscles were reduced, and the levels of their cell senescence-related proteins (p53, p21, p16, SOD1, SOD2, SIRT1, SIRT3) were considerably altered (p < 0.01). Conclusion: 5-HMF may induce chronic and systemic inflammation, which in turn accelerates the progression of the frailty of mice through cell senescence.
