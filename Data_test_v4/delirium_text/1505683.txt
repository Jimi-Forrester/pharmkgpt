1505683|a|The paired helical filament, which comprises the major fibrous element of the neurofibrillary tangle in Alzheimer's disease, contains abnormally phosphorylated microtubule-associated protein tau as its principal constituent. The repeat region of tau protein, which represents the microtubule binding domain, forms the core of the filament. Here we show that an expressed fragment of tau protein spanning the repeat region can assemble in vitro into filaments like those found in Alzheimer's disease.
