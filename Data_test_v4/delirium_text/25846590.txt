25846590|t|[Differential diagnosis of dementia with lewy bodies].
25846590|a|Kosaka and colleagues first reported dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) in 1976. They have also established the concept of DLB. It is important to differentiate DLB from other dementia, especially Alzheimer disease (AD), because the medical treatment, management, and prognosis of DLB and AD are different. We have used several clinical features and imaging tools to differentiate between DLB and AD. With regard to clinical features, patients with DLB have relatively mild memory disturbances and fluctuating cognition. However, compared to patients with AD they have more severe disturbances of attention and executive, visuospatial functions, visual hallucination, depression, autonomic symptoms. In addition, they show the presence of REM sleep behavior disorder and idiopathic parkinsonism. On performing imaging analysis, patients with DLB showed milder atrophy in the medial temporal lobe on brain MRI, reduced occipital activity on SPECT or PET, reduced MIBG uptake on MIBG cardiac scintigraphy, and low dopamine transporter activity in the basal ganglia on SPECT or PET.
