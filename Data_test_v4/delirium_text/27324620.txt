27324620|t|The polysialic acid mimetics 5-nonyloxytryptamine and vinorelbine facilitate nervous system repair.
27324620|a|Polysialic acid (PSA) is a large negatively charged glycan mainly attached to the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM). Several studies have shown that it is important for correct formation of brain circuitries during development and for synaptic plasticity, learning and memory in the adult. PSA also plays a major role in nervous system regeneration following injury. As a next step for clinical translation of PSA based therapeutics, we have previously identified the small organic compounds 5-nonyloxytryptamine and vinorelbine as PSA mimetics. Activity of 5-nonyloxytryptamine and vinorelbine had been confirmed in assays with neural cells from the central and peripheral nervous system in vitro and shown to be independent of their function as serotonin receptor 5-HT1B/1D agonist or cytostatic drug, respectively. As we show here in an in vivo paradigm for spinal cord injury in mice, 5-nonyloxytryptamine and vinorelbine enhance regain of motor functions, axonal regrowth, motor neuron survival and remyelination. These data indicate that 5-nonyloxytryptamine and vinorelbine may be re-tasked from their current usage as a 5-HT1B/1D agonist or cytostatic drug to act as mimetics for PSA to stimulate regeneration after injury in the mammalian nervous system.
