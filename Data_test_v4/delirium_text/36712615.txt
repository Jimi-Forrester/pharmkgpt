36712615|a|Three copper(ii) tetraaza complexes [Cu(ii)LBr]Br (1a), [Cu(ii)L(CIO4)](CIO4) (2a) and [Cu(ii)L](CIO4)2 (2b), where L = 5,5,7,12,12,14-hexamethyl-1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradeca-7,14-diene were prepared and confirmed by FTIR, 1HNMR and 13CNMR. The binding interaction of complex (1a, 2a, 2b) with calf thymus DNA (CT-DNA) was investigated using UV-vis absorption, luminescence titrations, viscosity measurements and molecular docking. The findings suggested that complex 1a, 2a and 2b bind to DNA by electrostatic interaction, and the strengths of the interaction were arranged according to 2b > 1a > 2a. The differences in binding strengths were certainly caused by the complexes' dissimilar charges and counter anions. Complex 2b, with the biggest binding strength towards the DNA, was further applied in developing the porcine sensor. The developed sensor exhibits a broad linear dynamic range, low detection limit, good selectivity, and reproducibility. Analysis of real samples showed that the biosensor had excellent selectivity towards the pork meat compared to chicken and beef meat.
