27118305|t|Imipenem-cilastatin-induced psychosis: a case report.
27118305|a|BACKGROUND: Elderly patients, in particular, have been reported to develop psychiatric side effects from antibiotics. Clarithromycin, quinolones, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, isoniazid, penicillin, and cephalosporins have been reported to cause psychosis. This case report bridges a void in the medical literature with regards to the psychiatric adverse effects of imipenem-cilastatin. CASE PRESENTATION: A 64-year-old Hispanic man in septic shock due to urinary tract infection was initiated on imipenem-cilastatin and mechanically ventilated, following admission to hospital. His mentation was normal for 72 hours after extubation and discontinuation of sedatives and opioids, following which he was noted to be in acute psychosis. Our patient's imipenem-cilastatin dose had been increased 24 hours prior to his violent visual and auditory hallucinations because his renal function had improved. The physical examination and laboratory tests did not reveal evidence of a new central nervous infection or endocrinopathy. His mentation improved after his antibiotic was switched to ceftriaxone, based on culture and sensitivity testing. Similar psychiatric symptoms developed 2 months later when he was treated with imipenem for a recurrent urinary tract infection. His symptoms again resolved with modification of his antibiotic regimen. CONCLUSIONS: Endocrine dysfunctions (thyroid, adrenal, and pituitary disorders) and toxic ingestions are medical disorders known to cause brief psychotic episodes. Fluoroquinolones, penicillins, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole are common antibiotics associated with this rare adverse effect. Several pharmacokinetic hypotheses have been proposed for this adverse effect: (1) N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor hypofunctioning, (2) sequential blockade of folic acid production, (3) inhibition of prostaglandin E2 and proinflammatory cytokine production, (4) increased central dopamine turnover, and (5) accumulation of toxic levels of the drug. Pre-existing psychopathology, relevant comorbidities, slow acetylation status, and increased permeability of the blood-brain barrier have been suggested to make patients more prone to developing psychosis. According to the literature, this psychiatric manifestation resolves within 2 weeks of discontinuing the offending agent. There appears to be underreporting of the psychiatric manifestations of imipenem-cilastatin, contrary to post-marketing surveillance data. It is imperative that physicians recognize these psychiatric side effects of antibiotics, because they are a fundamental treatment option.
