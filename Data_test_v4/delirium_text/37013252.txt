37013252|a|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the factors that influence walking ability in patients hospitalized due to aspiration pneumonia. METHODS: This retrospective observational study evaluated patients hospitalized with aspiration pneumonia. The primary endpoint was preservation of walking ability. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed with the preservation of walking ability as the dependent variable. RESULTS: A total of 143 patients were enrolled in this study. The patients were divided into two groups: those whose walking ability decreased after hospitalization (n = 61) and those whose walking ability was maintained after hospitalization (n = 82). Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that A-DROP (odds ratio [OR] 3.006; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.452, 6.541; P < 0.01), the Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index (OR 0.919; 95% CI 0.875, 0.960; P < 0.001) and days to initial mobilization (OR 1.221; 95% CI 1.036, 1.531; P < 0.05) were the independent early predictors for preservation of walking ability. CONCLUSION: Nutritional status and early mobilization were important risk factors affecting the maintenance of walking ability in patients hospitalized due to aspiration pneumonia. Thus, a combination of nutrition and early rehabilitation is needed for these patients.
