34765231|t|Dysphagia Severity and Management in Patients with COVID-19.
34765231|a|COVID-19 has resulted in unprecedented numbers of patients treated at intensive care units (ICUs). Dysphagia is a key concern in critical illness survivors. We investigated the severity of dysphagia in COVID-19 and the need to adapt practices to provide efficient care. We reviewed the literature on COVID-19, post-critical-illness dysphagia, and dysphagia and tracheostomy guidelines during the pandemic. Critically ill COVID-19 patients present a high incidence of dysphagia, aggravated by respiratory distress, deconditioning, and neurological complications. Mechanical ventilation (MV), delirium, sedation and weakness are worse in COVID-19 than in other etiologies of critical care. In awake patients, respiratory compromise impairs breathing-swallowing-coughing coordination. Tracheostomy reduces laryngopharyngeal trauma, sedation, delirium, ICU stay and improves swallowing rehabilitation. Tracheostomy weaning and swallowing evaluation is complex in COVID-19 due to respiratory instability and a team discussion will guide adaptations. Patients assessed in the ICU were 67% recommended to be nil by mouth (were aspirating). Two months following hospital discharge, 83% of those who had undergone tracheostomy were managing a normal diet. Severely ill COVID-19 patients are expected to regain swallow function. Dysphagia care is based on adaptation of practices to the patients' multiple impairments.
