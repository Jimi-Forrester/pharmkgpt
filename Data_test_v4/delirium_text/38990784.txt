Accepted manuscripts have been peer-reviewed and copyedited, but are posted online before technical formatting and author proofing. These manuscripts are not the final version of record and will be replaced with the final article (formatted per AJHP style and proofed by the authors) at a later time. PURPOSE: Severe ADAMTS13 deficiency (activity <10%) is the diagnostic threshold for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and is associated with various clinical symptoms, abnormal laboratory results, and long-term complications. METHODS: This retrospective, noninterventional cohort study used the Premier Healthcare Database to identify patients with ADAMTS13 activity of <10% in US hospitals from January 1, 2016, through March 31, 2020. The objective was to describe patient characteristics, laboratory results, comorbidities (as measured by the Elixhauser comorbidity index), symptoms, length of stay, treatment patterns, mortality, inpatient costs, and readmission rates (summarized descriptively). Inpatient costs were calculated as total cost to the hospital. RESULTS: There were 211 patients with severe ADAMTS13 deficiency; 89% of patients had a TTP-related diagnosis, of whom 62% had a primary diagnosis of thrombotic microangiopathy. Over 80% of patients with available data had a decreased platelet count and elevated lactate dehydrogenase; schistocytes were detected in 99%. The most prevalent symptoms/complications were neurological, bleeding, and pain. Most patients (86%) had 2 or more Elixhauser comorbidities. Over 80% of patients received 1 or more TTP-related treatments, mostly plasma exchange. The mean length of stay was 11.5 days; 5% of patients died during their stay. Readmission rates at 30, 60, and 90 days were 20%, 26%, and 28%, respectively. The median (interquartile range) total inpatient cost to the hospital throughout the index admission was $33,221 ($19,431-$64,901). CONCLUSION: Patients with severe ADAMTS13 deficiency have substantial clinical burden, have high mortality and readmission rates, and generate high costs for hospitals. There is a high need for a therapy that replaces ADAMTS13, thus addressing the root cause of the symptoms and complications caused by this deficiency.
