16039064|a|The present study was conducted to determine the concentration of amino acids in the cerebrospinal spinal fluid (CSF) and the activities of two tramsaminases: glutamic oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT) and glutamic pyruvate transaminase (GPT) in human Alzheimer disease (AD) and normal brain. L-glutamic acid, L-glutamine and L-alanine are the most abundant amino acids in the CSF (50-55% of total amino acids). L-glutamine occurs at much higher levels in Alzheimer CSF compared to the normal CSF (229+/-91.8 nmol/ml in AD versus 107+/-47.2 nmol/ml in normal; P=0.0041). In contrast, L-aspartate occurs at significantly lower concentrations in Alzheimer CSF than normal CSF (46.1+/-25.7 nmol/ml in Alzheimer versus 95.2+/-52.6 nmol/ml in normal; P=0.020). In Alzheimer brain (frontal, parietal and occipital cortices) GOT is present at significantly higher activities than in normal brain cortices (about 1.5 times higher; P<0.01). No significant differences for GPT activity occurred between normal and AD brain. Since CSF receives amino acids from brain tissues, and since GOT catalyzes the conversion of L-aspartate to L-glutamate, the higher concentrations of L-glutamine (which is derived from L-glutamate), and the lower concentrations of L-aspartate found in Alzheimer CSF could be considered as a consequence of the higher activity of GOT that occurs in Alzheimer brain.
