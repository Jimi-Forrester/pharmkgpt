38853922|a|Although large-scale genetic association studies have proven opportunistic for the delineation of neurodegenerative disease processes, we still lack a full understanding of the pathological mechanisms of these diseases, resulting in few appropriate treatment options and diagnostic challenges. To mitigate these gaps, the Neurodegenerative Disease Knowledge Portal (NDKP) was created as an open-science initiative with the aim to aggregate, enable analysis, and display all available genomic datasets of neurodegenerative disease, while protecting the integrity and confidentiality of the underlying datasets. The portal contains 218 genomic datasets, including genotyping and sequencing studies, of individuals across ten different phenotypic groups, including neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Lewy body dementia, and Parkinson's disease. In addition to securely hosting large genomic datasets, the NDKP provides accessible workflows and tools to effectively utilize the datasets and assist in the facilitation of customized genomic analyses. Here, we summarize the genomic datasets currently included within the portal, the bioinformatics processing of the datasets, and the variety of phenotypes captured. We also present example use-cases of the various user interfaces and integrated analytic tools to demonstrate their extensive utility in enabling the extraction of high-quality results at the source, for both genomics experts and those in other disciplines. Overall, the NDKP promotes open-science and collaboration, maximizing the potential for discovery from the large-scale datasets researchers and consortia are expending immense resources to produce and resulting in reproducible conclusions to improve diagnostic and therapeutic care for neurodegenerative disease patients.
