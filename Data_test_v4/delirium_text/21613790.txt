21613790|t|Polymorphisms in the catechol-o-methyltransferase gene and delirium in the elderly.
21613790|a|BACKGROUND/AIMS: Catechol-O-methyltransferase, encoded by the COMT gene, is one of the enzymes that degrade dopamine. The aim of this study was to investigate whether polymorphisms in the COMT gene were associated with delirium. METHODS: Patients aged 65 years and older, acutely admitted to the medical department or to the surgical department following hip fracture, were included. rs4680, rs4818, and rs6269 were genotyped. RESULTS: Delirious patients were older, and more frequently had preexisting functional or cognitive impairment (p < 0.001). Polymorphisms in the COMT gene were not associated with the development of delirium. CONCLUSION: Although the COMT gene is a promising candidate gene for delirium in the elderly, functional genetic variations were not associated with delirium.
