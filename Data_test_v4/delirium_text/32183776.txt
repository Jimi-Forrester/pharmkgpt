32183776|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder featuring the behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia. Patients with early-onset AD that exhibits first as psychotic symptoms usually lack obvious cognitive impairment, so they may be misdiagnosed with late-onset schizophrenia. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a patient who had prominent psychotic symptoms at the age of 60 and was initially diagnosed with very-late-onset-schizophrenia-like psychosis. Psychotic symptoms disappeared rapidly after treatment with olanzapine, and the patient later showed extrapyramidal symptoms and decline in cognitive function. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed frontotemporal atrophy, and positron emission tomography (PET) showed extensive areas of hypometabolism in the frontal cortex and head of the caudate nucleus. The patient's SORL1 gene was found to carry a heterozygrous mutation (c.296A > G). The patient was eventually diagnosed with early-onset AD. CONCLUSIONS: Our case suggests that clinicians should consider the possibility of early-onset AD in middle-aged or elderly patients whose first symptoms are the behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia. To distinguish early-onset AD from late-onset schizophrenia, clinicians should evaluate cognitive function, perform MRI and PET, and search for SORL1 mutations.
