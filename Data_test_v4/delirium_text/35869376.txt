35869376|t|Ameliorative Effect of Palm Oil in Aluminum Lactate Induced Biochemical and Histological Implications in Rat Brain.
35869376|a|alpha-Tocotrienol is one of the major constituents of palm oil. It is a well-known antioxidant and cholesterol-lowering neuroprotectant. To prevent the initiation of Alzheimer's like symptoms, much attention has been shifted to the major role played by antioxidants. Previous epidemiological reports correlate the increasing incidence of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD), to the aluminum (Al) content in drinking water. Al, being a ubiquitous element, has a long history of being particularly reactive towards multiple aspects of neurobiology. So, the current study examines the effect of Al-induced behavioral, biochemical, and histopathological changes in rat brain; and the ameliorative effect of palm oil in reducing the resulting neurotoxicity. The experimental design consisted of 4 groups: control group which received rodent chow diet and water ad libitum; Al group received aluminum lactate (50 mg/kg bw); Al + palm oil group was administered with Al (50 mg/kg bw) and palm oil (60 mg/kg bw); and palm oil group received palm oil (60 mg/kg bw). Al was given by oral gavage once daily for 6 weeks and palm oil was administered intraperitoneally. After 6 weeks of supplementation, Al + palm oil group showed significantly lower malondialdehyde (MDA) content, but higher superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), GST, and GPx activity as compared to Al group. Al group has significantly higher level of MDA content, but lower SOD, CAT, GST, and GPx activity as compared to control group. In conclusion, this study suggested that palm oil was effective in preventing the Al-induced brain damage in rats.
