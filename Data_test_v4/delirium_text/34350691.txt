34350691|a|AIMS: This follow-up study aimed to examine the 8-year efficacy and safety of subthalamic nucleus (STN) deep brain stimulation (DBS) for patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) in southern China. METHODS: The follow-up data of 10 patients with PD undergoing STN-DBS were analyzed. Motor symptoms were assessed before and 1, 3, 5, and 8 years after the surgery with stimulation-on in both off-medication (off-med) and on-medication (on-med) status using the Unified Parkinson's disease Rating Scale Part III. The quality of life was assessed using the 39-item Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire. The sleep, cognition, and emotion were evaluated using a series of nonmotor scales. Levodopa equivalent daily dose (LEDD) and stimulation parameters were recorded at each follow-up. RESULTS: The motor symptoms were improved by 50.9%, 37.7%, 36.7%, and 37.3% in 1, 3, 5, and 8 years, respectively, in the off-med / stimulation-on status compared with the baseline. The quality of life improved by 39.7% and 56.1% in 1 and 3 years, respectively, but declined to the preoperative level thereafter. The sleep, cognition, and emotion were mostly unchanged. LEDD reduced from 708.1 +- 172.5 mg to 330 +- 207.8 mg in 8 years. The stimulation parameters, including amplitude, pulse width, and frequency, were 2.77 +- 0.49 V, 71.3 +- 12.8 mus, and 121.5 +- 21 Hz, respectively, in 8 years. CONCLUSION: Long-term therapeutic efficacy of STN-DBS could be achieved even with relatively low stimulation intensity and medication dosage for PD patients in southern China. Motor improvement and medication reduction were maintained through the 8-year follow-up, but improvement in quality of life lasted for only 3 years. No definite changes was found in nonmotor symptoms after STN-DBS.
