35211082|t|Clinical and Molecular Correlates of Abnormal Changes in the Cerebellum and Globus Pallidus in Fragile X Premutation.
35211082|a|BACKGROUND: Fragile X premutation carriers (55-200 CGG triplets) may develop a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), after the age of 50. The neuroradiologic markers of FXTAS are hyperintense T2-signals in the middle cerebellar peduncle-the MCP sign. We recently noticed abnormal T2-signals in the globus pallidus in male premutation carriers and controls but the prevalence and clinical significance were unknown. METHODS: We estimated the prevalence of the MCP sign and pallidal T2-abnormalities in 230 male premutation carriers and 144 controls (aged 8-86), and examined the associations with FXTAS symptoms, CGG repeat length, and iron content in the cerebellar dentate nucleus and globus pallidus. RESULTS: Among participants aged >=45 years (175 premutation carriers and 82 controls), MCP sign was observed only in premutation carriers (52 vs. 0%) whereas the prevalence of pallidal T2-abnormalities approached significance in premutation carriers compared with controls after age-adjustment (25.1 vs. 13.4%, p = 0.069). MCP sign was associated with impaired motor and executive functioning, and the additional presence of pallidal T2-abnormalities was associated with greater impaired executive functioning. Among premutation carriers, significant iron accumulation was observed in the dentate nucleus, and neither pallidal or MCP T2-abnormalities affected measures of the dentate nucleus. While the MCP sign was associated with CGG repeat length >75 and dentate nucleus volume correlated negatively with CGG repeat length, pallidal T2-abnormalities did not correlate with CGG repeat length. However, pallidal signal changes were associated with age-related accelerated iron depletion and variability and having both MCP and pallidal signs further increased iron variability in the globus pallidus. CONCLUSIONS: Only the MCP sign, not pallidal abnormalities, revealed independent associations with motor and cognitive impairment; however, the occurrence of combined MCP and pallidal T2-abnormalities may present a risk for greater cognitive impairment and increased iron variability in the globus pallidus.
