34188984|t|A Gut Feeling: Acute Liver Failure - An Unusual Manifestation of Malignant Catatonia.
34188984|a|We present a rare case in which malignant catatonia led to acute liver failure (ALF). A 19-year-old male was admitted for psychosis and developed ALF with a peak aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase of 5,728 U/L and 7,735 U/L, respectively, and a peak international normalized ratio of 7.1. Liver biopsy showed significant confluent necrosis involving >70% of the liver tissue. He was listed for a liver transplant but was ultimately taken off of because of significant improvement with treatment by N-acetylcysteine infusion. Through our research, we found that symptoms of hepatitis can be seen with psychotic disorders, but ALF is rare.
