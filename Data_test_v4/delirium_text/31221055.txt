31221055|a|Background and Purpose- The role of inflammation in ischemic white matter disease is increasingly recognized, and further understanding of the pathophysiology might inform future treatment strategies. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune condition in which inflammation plays a central role that also affects the white matter. We hypothesized that white matter injury might share common mechanisms and used statistical genetics techniques to assess whether having genetically elevated white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume was associated with increased MS risk. Methods- We investigated the genetic association in 2 cohorts with magnetic resonance imaging-quantified ischemic white matter lesion volume (WMH in stroke; n=2797 and UK Biobank; n=8353) and 14 802 cases of MS and 26 703 controls from the International Multiple Sclerosis Genetics Consortium. We further performed individual-level polygenic risk score calculations for MS and measures of structural white matter disease in UK Biobank. Finally, we looked for evidence of overlapping risk across the whole genome. Results- There was no association of genetic variants influencing MS with WMH volume using summary statistics in the WMH in stroke cohort (relative risk score =1.014; 95% CI, 0.936-1.110) or in the UK Biobank cohort (relative risk score =1.030; 95% CI, 0.932-1.117). Conversely, assessing the contribution of single nucleotide polymorphisms significantly associated with WMH on the risk of MS there was no significant association (relative risk score =0.930; 95% CI, 0.736-1.191). There were no significant associations between polygenic risk scores calculations; these results were robust to the selection of single nucleotide polymorphisms at a range of significance thresholds. Whole genome analysis did not reveal any overlap of risk between the traits. Conclusions- Our results do not provide evidence to suggest a shared mechanism of white matter damage in ischemia and MS. We propose that inflammation acts in distinct pathways because of the differing nature of the primary insult.
