36872256|a|The degeneration of monoaminergic system and the reduction of monoamine neurotransmitters(MNTs) are associated with the occurrence of a variety of neuropsychiatric diseases, becoming the key indicators for clinical diagnosis and treatment. Recent studies suggested gut microbiota could influence the occurrence, development, and treatment of neuropsychiatric diseases by directly or indirectly regulating the synthesis and metabolism of MNTs. Rich clinical experience has been accumulated in the amelioration and treatment of neuropsychiatric diseases by traditional Chinese medicines. The traditional oral administration method demonstrates obvious advantages in regulating gut microbiota. It provides a new idea for explaining the pharmacodynamic material basis and mechanism of traditional Chinese medicines in ameliorating neuropsychiatric disease by improving the levels of MNTs via gut microbiota regulation. Focusing on three common neuropsychiatric diseases including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and major depression, we summarized the pathways of gut microbiota in regulating the levels of MNTs and the paradigms of traditional Chinese medicines in ameliorating neuropsychiatric diseases via the &quot;bacteria-gut-brain axis&quot;, aiming to provide ideas for the development of drugs and treatment schemes.
