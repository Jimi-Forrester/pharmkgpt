34528182|t|Clinical study of central cholinergic pathway damage in two mild cognitive impairment patients.
34528182|a|OBJECTIVES: To explore the role of the central cholinergic system in amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and mild vascular cognitive impairment (vMCI). METHODS: Twenty-five aMCI patients and 25 vMCI patients were enrolled in this study, and 25 healthy people were chosen as a control group. All participants performed a set of cognitive function scales and were subjected to a brain MRI. We analyzed differences in neuropsychological damage between groups, as well as the degree of brain atrophy and changes in the microstructure of central cholinergic pathways (CCP) in relation to effects on neuropsychological scores. RESULTS: (1) Regarding neuropsychological characteristics of the three groups, scores on the MoCA scale, immediate memory, delayed recall, cued recall, long time prolonged recognition, and CDR-SB of the control group were significantly better than those of the aMCI and vMCI groups. Scores on immediate memory, delayed memory, cued recall, long time delayed recognition, and Forward of Digital Span Test (FDST) in the aMCI group were lower than those in the vMCI group. Compared with the aMCI group, the vMCI group was significantly delayed in Trail Making Test (TMA)-A, TMT-B, and TMT B-A. There were no significant differences in HAMA, HAMD, MMSE, MoCA, the Boston Naming Test (BNT), language fluency or visual scale of posterior atrophy (Koedam score) between the vMCI and aMCI groups. (2) As for microstructure changes in the central cholinergic pathway, vMCI group had a decreased FA value in the cingulum (Cing) of the medial pathway, but an increased MD value in the external capsule (Excap) of the lateral pathway when compared to other two groups. Furthermore, the CingMD value of the vMCI group was higher than that of the control group, but the difference was not obvious when compared to the aMCI group. (3) Last, we researched microstructural changes to CCP, degree of brain atrophy, and neuropsychological scores by using partial correlation analysis for all participants. CingFA was negatively correlated with TMT-B, B-A, and FDST. CingMD was negatively correlated with FDST. ExcapFA was positively correlated with MMSE and Backward of BDST, while ExcapMD was negatively correlated with MMSE and MoCA. Claustrum (Claus)FA was positively related to MoCA and FDST, but was negatively related to TMT-A. ClausMD was negatively correlated with MoCA and language fluency. Koedam score was positively correlated with CDR-SB, ExcapMD, and ClausMD, but negatively correlated with MMSE score and inverse BDST. CONCLUSION: The central cholinergic system is involved in the cognitive impairment of both aMCI and vMCI, and their mechanisms may be distinct. aMCI patients may present with primary CCP impairment while vMCI patients probably exhibit impairment secondary to vasogenic damage to the cholinergic system projection network. The lateral cholinergic pathway was more severely impaired than the medial pathway in vMCI patients, in addition to being associated with decreased executive and general cognitive functions. The damage to CCP was related to the degree of brain atrophy, and both may be involved in the development and progression of cognitive dysfunction.
