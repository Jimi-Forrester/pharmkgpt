33665742|a|Gliomas constitute the most frequent tumors of the brain. High-grade gliomas are characterized by a poor prognosis caused by a set of attributes making treatment difficult, such as heterogeneity and cell infiltration. Additionally, there is a subgroup of glioma cells with properties similar to those of stem cells responsible for tumor recurrence after treatment. Since proteasomal degradation regulates multiple cellular processes, any mutation causing disturbances in the function or expression of its elements can lead to various disorders such as cancer. Several studies have focused on protein degradation modulation as a mechanism of glioma control. The ubiquitin proteasome system is the main mechanism of cellular proteolysis that regulates different events, intervening in pathological processes with exacerbating or suppressive effects on diseases. This review analyzes the role of proteasomal degradation in gliomas, emphasizing the elements of this system that modulate different cellular mechanisms in tumors and discussing the potential of distinct compounds controlling brain tumorigenesis through the proteasomal pathway.
