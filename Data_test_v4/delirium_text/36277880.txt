36277880|t|Meta-Analysis of Matrix Metalloproteinases in the Risk of Cardiovascular and Neurodegenerative Diseases.
36277880|a|Objective: To investigate the risk of cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases induced by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) by meta-analysis. Methods: Relevant literature was searched from Wanfang Medical Center, CNQI, VIP, PubMed, and other domestic and foreign literature databases for the research direction, and the risk of cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases induced by MMPs was meta-analyzed using the fixed-effect model and random-effect model. Results: MMP-1 and MMP-9 were risk factors for cardiovascular diseases by fixed and random-effect model analysis, respectively, while MMP-2 and MMP-9 were risk factors for increased neurodegenerative diseases by random-effect model analysis. Conclusion: MMP-1 and MMP-9 are risk factors for cardiovascular diseases, and MMP-2 and MMP-9 are major factors for increased risk of neurodegenerative diseases. MMP-1, MMP-2, and MMP-9 can be used as new targets for clinical diagnosis, treatment, and research of subsequent cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases.
