39410590|t|Histopathological Analysis of Pseudoexfoliation Material in Ocular Surgeries: Clinical Implications.
39410590|a|BACKGROUND: Pseudoexfoliation syndrome (PEX) is a common age-related ocular condition characterized by the accumulation of a fibrillar, pseudoexfoliative material on the anterior segment of the eye. This study aims to investigate the histopathological characteristics of pseudoexfoliative material within different ocular structures, including the eyelid, conjunctiva, and anterior lens capsule. METHODS: A total of 32 anterior lens capsules, 3 eyelid fragments, and 12 conjunctival specimens were obtained from patients clinically diagnosed with PEX during ocular surgeries at the Onioptic Hospital of Ophthalmology. The tissue specimens were subsequently processed using the classical histological technique of paraffin embedding. This process enabled the production of serial sections with a thickness of 4 microns, facilitating the microscopic examination of fine details. The sections were stained with the hematoxylin-eosin (HE) method for the observation of microscopic structures. RESULTS: This study's findings reveal that PEX material, characterized by its fibrillar and amorphous components, is consistently present across multiple ocular structures, including the anterior lens capsule, eyelid, and conjunctiva. When stained with H&E, the PEX material typically appears as amorphous, eosinophilic deposits. Under higher magnification, these deposits exhibit a fibrillar structure, often appearing as irregular, granular, or filamentous aggregates. CONCLUSIONS: The deposit of fibrillar material in the eyelid and conjunctiva, though less commonly emphasized compared to other structures, is a significant finding that sheds light on the systemic nature of the syndrome. The consistent identification of fibrillar eosinophilic deposits across these structures highlights the systemic distribution of PEX material, reinforcing the notion that PEX syndrome is not confined to the anterior segment of the eye.
