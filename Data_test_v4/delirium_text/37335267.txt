37335267|t|Extrastriatal Accumulation of 18F-FP-CIT at Cerebral Infarction in a Patient With Suspected Parkinson Disease.
37335267|a|ABSTRACT: 18F-FP-CIT PET/CT is a useful diagnostic tool for differentiating between idiopathic Parkinson disease and atypical Parkinson syndrome by visualizing the striatum, where the nerve endings of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons are located. We present an unusual accumulation of 18F-FP-CIT in the infarct and peri-infarct brain area of an 83-year-old man who was referred for the management of suspected cerebral infarction due to sudden dysarthria and delirium.
