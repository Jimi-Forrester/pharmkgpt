36119942|a|This case describes a patient with a history of bariatric surgery who was admitted to our hospital with a severe venlafaxine intoxication. Due to the altered anatomy of the gastrointestinal tract, the use of oral activated charcoal and large volumes of laxatives to prevent further uptake of venlafaxine was hampered. This resulted in massive absorption and a severe serotonergic syndrome. The patient was successfully treated with intravenous lipid emulsion.
