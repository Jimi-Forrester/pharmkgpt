26341147|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative brain disorder that involves a plethora of molecular pathways. In the context of therapeutic treatment and biomarker profiling, the amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide constitutes an interesting research avenue that involves interactions within a complex mixture of Abeta alloforms and other disease-modifying factors. Here, we explore the potential of an ecosystem paradigm as a novel way to consider AD and Abeta dynamics in particular. We discuss the example that the complexity of the Abeta network not only exhibits interesting parallels with the functioning of complex systems such as ecosystems but that this analogy can also provide novel insights into the neurobiological phenomena in AD and serve as a communication tool. We propose that combining network medicine with general ecosystem management principles could be a new and holistic approach to understand AD pathology and design novel therapies.
