14501022|t|Acetylcholinesterase: a multifaceted target for structure-based drug design of anticholinesterase agents for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
14501022|a|The structure of Torpedo californica acetylcholinesterase is examined in complex with several inhibitors that are either in use or under development for treating Alzheimer's disease. The noncovalent inhibitors vary greatly in their structures and bind to different sites of the enzyme, offering many different starting points for future drug design.
