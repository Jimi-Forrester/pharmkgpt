2812325|t|Monozygotic twins discordant for Alzheimer's disease.
2812325|a|We identified 3 pairs of monozygotic twins discordant for probable Alzheimer's disease from a twin register and found no systematic differences in potential risk factor exposures between affected and unaffected twins. Such cases predict a role for environmental factors in the etiology or clinical onset of Alzheimer's disease.
