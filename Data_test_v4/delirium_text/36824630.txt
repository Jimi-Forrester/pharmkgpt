36824630|t|REGIONAL ANESTHESIA IN SPINAL SURGERY: COULD IT BE THE SOLUTION FOR DIFFICULT INTUBATION.
36824630|a|This article includes two topics - anesthesia for spinal surgery and difficult airway, both of them are linked with the same topic, which is regional anesthesia. In recent years, regional anesthesia for spinal surgery has gained a great popularity, where neuraxial blocks are the first choice. Regional anesthesia seems to have benefits against general anesthesia due to lower rate of perioperative and postoperative complications, lower cost and length of stay. This is more evident in elderly population or patients with comorbidities. On the other hand, difficult airway is the life threatening condition and requires increased attention. There are many methods and tools for managing difficult airways, but there are few supporters of regional anesthesia as an option or solution in these cases. Of course, special attention is required during regional anesthesia in a patient with difficult airway, the decision must be correct, and an anesthesiologist must have a preformulated strategy for airway management. However, does not the same happen even when we apply general anesthesia?
