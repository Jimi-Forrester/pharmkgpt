37876433|t|Mechanistic inhibition of gastric cancer-associated bacteria Helicobacter pylori by selected phytocompounds: A new cutting-edge computational approach.
37876433|a|Background: Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a persistent bacterial inhabitant in the stomachs of approximately half the global populace. This bacterium is directly linked to chronic gastritis, leading to a heightened risk of duodenal and gastric ulcer diseases, and is the predominant risk factor for gastric cancer - the second most common cause of cancer-related deaths globally. The increasing prevalence of antibiotic resistance necessitates the exploration of innovative treatment alternatives to mitigate the H. pylori menace. Methods: Initiating our study, we curated a list of thirty phytochemicals based on previous literature and subjected them to molecular docking studies. Subsequently, eight phytocompounds-Glabridin, Isoliquiritin, Sanguinarine, Liquiritin, Glycyrrhetic acid, Beta-carotin, Diosgenin, and Sarsasapogenin-were meticulously chosen based on superior binding scores. These were further subjected to an extensive computational analysis encompassing ADMET profiling, drug-likeness evaluation, principal component analysis (PCA), and molecular dynamic simulations (MDs) in comparison with the conventional drug, Mitomycin. Results: The natural compounds investigated demonstrated superior docking affinities to H. pylori targets compared to the standard Mitomycin. Notably, the phytocompounds Diosgenin and Sarsasapogenin stood out due to their exceptional binding affinities and pharmacokinetic properties, including favorable ADMET profiles. Conclusion: Our comprehensive and technologically-advanced approach showcases the potential of identified phytocompounds as pioneering therapeutic agents against H. pylori-induced gastric malignancies. In light of our promising in silico results, we recommend these natural compounds as potential candidates for advancing H. pylori-targeted drug development. Given their potential, we strongly advocate for subsequent in vitro and in vivo studies to validate their therapeutic efficacy against this formidable gastrointestinal bacterium.
