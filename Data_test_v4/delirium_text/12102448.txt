12102448|t|Association between neuropsychiatric and autonomic dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease.
12102448|a|We sought to determine whether there was an association between specific neuropsychiatric deficits and autonomic dysfunction in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). We studied 20 patients and 20 age-matched control subjects with neuropsychiatric tests (Blessed, Cornell depression and NPI scores) and autonomic tests (Deep breath (HRdb), 30:15 ratio and orthostatic hypotension (Bpoh)). The 30:15 ratio was consistently reduced in AD patients as compared to control subjects (1.05+/-0.07 for patients and 1.18+/-0.1 for controls, p 0.001). Whereas there were no significant differences in the HRdb and presence of Bpoh. In AD patients with an abnormal 30:15 ratio, there were significant abnormalities in the Blessed score and in the apathy, delusions and aberrant motor behavior items of the NPI. The other autonomic tests did not correlate with any neuropsychiatric score. The relationship between abnormal cortical function and impaired 30:15 ratio suggested that a lack of cortical modulation of autonomic circuits may underlie cardiovascular instability in these patients.
