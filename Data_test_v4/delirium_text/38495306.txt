38495306|a|Components that comprise our brain parenchymal and cerebrovascular structures provide a homeostatic environment for proper neuronal function to ensure normal cognition. Cerebral insults (e.g. ischaemia, microbleeds and infection) alter cellular structures and physiologic processes within the neurovascular unit and contribute to cognitive dysfunction. COVID-19 has posed significant complications during acute and convalescent stages in multiple organ systems, including the brain. Cognitive impairment is a prevalent complication in COVID-19 patients, irrespective of severity of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, overwhelming evidence from in vitro, preclinical and clinical studies has reported SARS-CoV-2-induced pathologies in components of the neurovascular unit that are associated with cognitive impairment. Neurovascular unit disruption alters the neurovascular coupling response, a critical mechanism that regulates cerebromicrovascular blood flow to meet the energetic demands of locally active neurons. Normal cognitive processing is achieved through the neurovascular coupling response and involves the coordinated action of brain parenchymal cells (i.e. neurons and glia) and cerebrovascular cell types (i.e. endothelia, smooth muscle cells and pericytes). However, current work on COVID-19-induced cognitive impairment has yet to investigate disruption of neurovascular coupling as a causal factor. Hence, in this review, we aim to describe SARS-CoV-2's effects on the neurovascular unit and how they can impact neurovascular coupling and contribute to cognitive decline in acute and convalescent stages of the disease. Additionally, we explore potential therapeutic interventions to mitigate COVID-19-induced cognitive impairment. Given the great impact of cognitive impairment associated with COVID-19 on both individuals and public health, the necessity for a coordinated effort from fundamental scientific research to clinical application becomes imperative. This integrated endeavour is crucial for mitigating the cognitive deficits induced by COVID-19 and its subsequent burden in this especially vulnerable population.
