29790068|t|Neuritin Attenuates Neuronal Apoptosis Mediated by Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress In Vitro.
29790068|a|Neuritin is an extracellular glycophosphatidylinositol-linked protein that promotes neuronal survival, differentiation, function, and repair, but the exact mechanism of this neuroprotective effect remains unclear. Meanwhile, endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) induced apoptosis is attracting increased attention. In this work, we hypothesized that neuritin inhibited ERS to protect cortical neurons. To check this hypothesis, we exposed primary cultured cortical neurons to oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) for 45 min followed by reperfusion (R) to activate ERS. We then performed resuscitation for 6, 12, 24, and 48 h. ERS-related factors such as glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), caspase-12 and CHOP were detected by Western blotting and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assay. Apoptosis was assessed by Annexin V binding and propidium iodide staining. Ultrastructural changes of endoplasmic reticulum were observed under a transmission electron microscope. Results showed that GRP78 expression significantly increased at 12, 24, and 48 h and peaked at 24 h. Caspase-12 and CHOP expression significantly increased in a time-dependent manner at 12, 24, and 48 h. GRP78, caspase-12 and CHOP expression as well as apoptosis rate of primary cultured neurons and the ultrastructural changes of endoplasmic reticulum in the OGD/R + neuritin group significantly improved compared with the OGD/R group. In conclusion, the neuroprotection function of neuritin may be involved in ERS pathways.
