34898932|t|Identifying the Needs Based on the Patients' Performance Status for Palliative Care Team: An Observational Study.
34898932|a|OBJECTIVES: The study aim was to determine the association between patient performance status (PS) and the contents of a palliative care team (PCT) intervention. Identifying intervention requirements for differing PS may help to provide appropriate palliative care in under-resourced facilities. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We collected data from medical records of inpatients (n = 496) admitted to PCT services at a centre for palliative care at Kindai University Hospital, Japan, from April 2017 to March 2019. We analysed the content of PCT activities according to each PS using Pearson's Chi-square test. RESULTS: The following PCT activities were provided in full regardless of PS: Gastrointestinal symptoms, depression, medical staff support, food and nutrition support and oral care. The following PCT responses were associated with PS: Pain, respiratory symptoms, fatigue, insomnia, anxiety, delirium, decision-making support, family support and rehabilitation. PS3 patients tended to receive those PCT interventions associated with PS, except for anxiety and fatigue. PS4 patients received PCT interventions for respiratory symptoms, delirium and family support. Patients with good PS (0-1) tended to receive PCT interventions for anxiety. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that there were different needs for different PS. The results may allow for efficient interventions even in facilities with limited resources.
