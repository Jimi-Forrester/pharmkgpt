33510058|a|Astrocytes play multifaceted and vital roles in maintaining neurophysiological function of the central nervous system by regulating homeostasis, increasing synaptic plasticity, and sustaining neuroprotective effects. Astrocytes become activated as a result of inflammatory responses during the progression of pathological changes associated with neurodegenerative disorders. Reactive astrocytes (neurotoxic A1 and neuroprotective A2) are triggered during disease progression and pathogenesis due to neuroinflammation and ischemia. However, only a limited body of literature describes morphological and functional changes of astrocytes during the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. The present review investigated the detrimental and beneficial roles of astrocytes in neurodegenerative diseases reported in recent studies, as these cells have promising therapeutic potential and offer new approaches for treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.
