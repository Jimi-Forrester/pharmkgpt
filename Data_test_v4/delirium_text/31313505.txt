31313505|a|PURPOSE: To analyze magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings and clinical diagnosis and treatment data relating to Angiostrongylus cantonensis infection to gain insight into the disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis and treatment data, imaging manifestations, and outcomes of 27 patients who were clinically diagnosed with angiostrongyliasis and who underwent contrast-enhanced brain MRI. RESULTS: Patients with A. cantonensis infection had a history of eating raw mollusks in the endemic area, and they mainly presented with dizziness and headache of varying degrees and vomiting (n = 7). Laboratory examinations revealed increased peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) eosinophils, as well as increased CSF protein levels. Brain MRI findings mainly included eosinophilic meningitis, whereas linear or nodular enhancement of the pia mater was observed in enhanced T1-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images, accompanied by encephalitis or vasculitis. Meningitis manifested as multiple, thickened flow voids around the meninges, and contrast-enhanced scans showed substantial enhancement in intracranial dilated and hyperplastic blood vessels. CONCLUSION: The possibility of A. cantonensis infection should be considered in the effective use of albendazole or mebendazole as a treatment. Combining clinical history with laboratory examination is helpful in diagnosing A. cantonensis infection. A final definite diagnosis can be confirmed by detecting larvae in the CSF. The administration of corticosteroids during pathogen therapy can substantially reduce the therapeutic response.
