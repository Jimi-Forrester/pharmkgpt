23486726|t|Unexpected Significantly Reduced FDG Uptake in the Cerebrum Compared Against Normal Liver Uptake in a Dying Patient.
23486726|a|UNLABELLED: F-18 FDG PET-CT scanning plays an important role in the management of fever of unknown origin (FUO). Some elderly patients with FUO can be in their terminal stage of life. An elderly woman was referred for a PET-CT scan to find the etiology of FUO. The scan was inconclusive but showed significantly reduced FDG uptake in the brain and heart, despite normal physiological uptake in the liver and bowel. The patient deceased within the hour post scan. Contrary to common belief, we have shown that cerebral glucose metabolism via cerebral perfusion may be compromised before hepatic and bowel perfusion in a dying patient. CONFLICT OF INTEREST: None declared.
