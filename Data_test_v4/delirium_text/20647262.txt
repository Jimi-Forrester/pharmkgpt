20647262|t|Predictive model for postoperative delirium in cardiac surgical patients.
20647262|a|Delirium is a common complication following cardiac surgery, and the predictors of delirium remain unclear. The authors performed a prospective observational analysis to develop a predictive model for postoperative delirium using demographic and procedural parameters. A total of 112 adult postoperative cardiac surgical patients were evaluated twice daily for delirium using the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) and Confusion Assessment Model for the ICU (CAM-ICU). The incidence of delirium was 34% (n = 38). Increased age (odds ratio [OR] = 2.5; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.6-3.9; P < .0001, per 10 years) and increased duration of surgery (OR = 1.3; 95% CI = 1.1-1.5; P = .0002, per 30 minutes) were independently associated with postoperative delirium. Gender, BMI, diabetes mellitus, preoperative ejection fraction, surgery type, length of cardiopulmonary bypass, intraoperative blood component administration, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, and Charlson Comorbidity Index, were not independently associated with postoperative delirium.
