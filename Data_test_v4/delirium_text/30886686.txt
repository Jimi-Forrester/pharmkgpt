30886686|t|Frequency of Depression-Related Symptoms in Caregivers of Patients with Silicosis.
30886686|a|Background: Few studies have evaluated depression in female caregivers of patients with silicosis. Thus, the aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of depression in such caregivers and to clarify the factors associated with symptoms of depression. Methods: Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). Results: A total of 561 participants met the inclusion criteria and were enrolled in the study. The mean CES-D score was 16.68, with a standard deviation (SD) of 8.57; the sex-classified analysis indicated that the mean CES-D score of female caregivers was 17.79 (SD: 10.17), while the mean score of male caregivers was 14.98 (SD: 8.36) (p < 0.05). 68.6% caregivers who were beyond the cutoff score (16) with the following factors were more likely to report depression-related symptoms: unemployed status (OR = 1.752, 95% CI: 1.35-2.01, p=0.032) and caregiver for more than 48 months (OR = 1.26, 95% CI: 1.61-2.43, p=0.027). Conclusions: Collectively, there is statistical difference between female caregivers of patients with silicosis and male ones. More effort is needed to meet the psychosocial needs of these caregivers.
