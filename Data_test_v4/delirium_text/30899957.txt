30899957|t|Nursing Understanding and Perceptions of Delirium: Assessing Current Knowledge, Attitudes, and Beliefs in a Burn ICU.
30899957|a|The number of delirium days in hospitalized patients directly correlates with mortality and long-term cognitive dysfunction. Burn patients are at greater risk for delirium due to prolonged mechanical ventilation, high sedative and analgesic medication requirements, and the common need for multiple operations. Limited research exists on nurses' understanding and comfort using delirium screening tools and preventive interventions. A process improvement project was developed in a single, regional burn intensive care unit (BICU) with the goal of increasing RN staff awareness of delirium, delirium assessment, and preventive interventions. A 10-question survey was developed and administered to the BICU RN staff before and after the educational intervention. Both quantitative and qualitative data analyses were performed. Twenty-seven (38%) anonymous surveys were returned. In pre- and postintervention surveys, respondents agreed that nursing interventions were important in preventing delirium. Despite educational intervention, 26% of the respondents reported that a tool is not needed to identify delirium. Survey analysis indicated strong support for nonpharmacologic nursing interventions in preventing delirium as well as reducing pharmacologic interventions, especially benzodiazepines. Mechanical ventilation was perceived as a barrier to performing the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) in both pre- and postsurveys. Staff compliance with documenting CAM-ICU assessments increased and CAM-positive days decreased over the project timeline. Overall, BICU nurses' awareness and general knowledge about delirium increased and specific knowledge deficits were discovered. Continued education about the CAM-ICU tool is still needed; additionally addressing barriers within the structure of the unit to provide nurses more resources to properly assess and prevent delirium.
