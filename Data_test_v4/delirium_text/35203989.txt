35203989|t|Stochasticity, Entropy and Neurodegeneration.
35203989|a|We previously suggested that stochastic processes are fundamental in the development of sporadic adult onset neurodegenerative disorders. In this study, we develop a theoretical framework to explain stochastic processes at the protein, DNA and RNA levels. We propose that probability determines random sequencing changes, some of which favor neurodegeneration in particular anatomical spaces, and that more than one protein may be affected simultaneously. The stochastic protein changes happen in three-dimensional space and can be considered to be vectors in a space-time continuum, their trajectories and kinetics modified by physiological variables in the manifold of intra- and extra-cellular space. The molecular velocity of these degenerative proteins must obey the second law of thermodynamics, in which entropy is the driver of the inexorable progression of neurodegeneration in the context of the N-body problem of interacting proteins, time-space manifold of protein-protein interactions in phase space, and compounded by the intrinsic disorder of protein-protein networks. This model helps to elucidate the existence of multiple misfolded proteinopathies in adult sporadic neurodegenerative disorders.
