36710158|a|BACKGROUND: Autopsy has benefited the practice of medicine for centuries; however, its use to advance the practice of oral health care is relatively limited. In the era of precision oral medicine, the research autopsy is poised to play an important role in understanding oral-systemic health, including infectious disease, autoimmunity, craniofacial genetics, and cancer. TYPES OF STUDIES REVIEWED: The authors reviewed relevant articles that used medical and dental research autopsies to summarize the advantages of minimally invasive autopsies of dental, oral, and craniofacial tissues and to outline practices for supporting research autopsies of the oral and craniofacial complex. RESULTS: The authors provide a historical summary of research autopsy in dentistry and provide a perspective on the value of autopsies for high-resolution multiomic studies to benefit precision oral medicine. As the promise of high-resolution multiomics is being realized, there is a need to integrate the oral and craniofacial complex into the practice of autopsy in medicine. Furthermore, the collaboration of autopsy centers with researchers will accelerate the understanding of dental, oral, and craniofacial tissues as part of the whole body. CONCLUSIONS: Autopsies must integrate oral and craniofacial tissues as part of biobanking procedures. As new technologies allow for high-resolution, multimodal phenotyping of human samples, using optimized sampling procedures will allow for unprecedented understanding of common and rare dental, oral, and craniofacial diseases in the future. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the oral cavity as a site for viral infection and transmission potential; this was only discovered via clinical autopsies. The realization of the integrated autopsy's value in full body health initiatives will benefit patients across the globe.
