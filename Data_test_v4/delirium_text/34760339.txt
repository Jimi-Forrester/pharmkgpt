34760339|a|Blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction is associated with an accumulation of neurotoxic molecules and increased infiltration of peripheral cells within the brain parenchyma. Accruing evidence suggests that microglia and astrocytes play a crucial role in the recovery of BBB integrity and the corralling of infiltrating cells into clusters after brain damage, but the mechanisms involved remain unclear. Intriguingly, the results of flow cytometry and immunofluorescence analyses have shown that BBB permeability to peripheral cells is substantially enhanced during normal aging at 12 months in mice. Thus, we used the SMART-seq2 method to perform RNA sequencing of microglia and astrocytes at five time points before and immediately after the BBB permeability change. Our comprehensive analyses revealed that microglia are characterized by marked alterations in the negative regulation of protein phosphorylation and phagocytic vesicles, whereas astrocytes show elevated enzyme or peptidase-inhibitor activity in the recovery of BBB function. Moreover, we identified a cassette of key genes that might ameliorate the insults of pathophysiological events in aging and neurodegenerative disease.
