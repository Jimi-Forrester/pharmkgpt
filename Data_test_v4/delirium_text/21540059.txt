21540059|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterizing by degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the nigrostriatal pathway. The discovery of levodopa revolutionized the treatment of PD however, after several years of treatment most patients develop involuntary movements which significantly impair the quality of life. 4-Aminopyridine (4-AP) and tetraethylammonium (TEA) are wide-spectrum potassium channel blockers which based on the animal model studies and clinical trials have beneficial effects in treatment of several neurological disorders such as ataxia, Alzheimer disease and multiple sclerosis. Current study investigates effect of these blockers in the treatment of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced Parkinsonism. After surgical injection of 6-OHDA into medial forebrain bundle, behavioral tests were performed in the 2nd and 3rd weeks post-surgery. Only animals which showed more than 100 apomorphine-induced rotations/1h in the 3rd week were selected for evaluation of the blocker effects. Statistical analysis of results from rotational test shows that application of high dose of 4-AP (1mg/kg) and moderate dose of TEA (2mg/kg) attenuate behavioral symptoms of the Parkinsonism while high dose of TEA (5mg/kg) and application both 4-AP and TEA exacerbates these symptoms. Results from elevated body swing test confirmed the effects of TEA but not 4-AP on the rotational test. However, experiments performed on the partial Parkinsonian rats show that application of high dose of TEA attenuates apomorphine-induced rotational asymmetry significantly. Our findings indicating TEA and 4-AP could have significant effects in attenuation of PD symptoms but these effects are sensitive to dose and degree of severity of PD.
