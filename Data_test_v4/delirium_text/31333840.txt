31333840|a|BACKGROUND: For parkinsonian disorders, progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) continues to be significant for differential diagnosis. PSP presents a range of ocular abnormalities that have been suggested as optional tools for its early detection, apart from the principal characteristic of postural unsteadiness. Nonetheless, such symptoms may be difficult to identify, particularly during the early onset stage of the disorder. It may also be problematic to recognize these symptoms for general practitioners who lack the required experience or physicians who are not specifically educated and proficient in ophthalmology or neurology. MAIN BODY: Thus, here, a methodical evaluation was carried out to identify seven oculomotor abnormalities occurring in PSP, comprising square wave jerks, the speed and range of saccades (slow saccades and vertical supranuclear gaze palsy), 'round the houses' sign, decreased blink rate, blepharospasm, and apraxia of eyelid opening. Inspections were conducted using direct visual observation. An approach to distinguish these signs during a bedside examination was also established. When presenting in a patient with parkinsonism or dementia, the existence of such ocular abnormalities could increase the risk of PSP. For the distinction between PSP and other parkinsonian disorders, these signs hold significant value for physicians. CONCLUSION: The authors urge all concerned physicians to check for such abnormalities with the naked eye in patients with parkinsonism. This method has advantages, including ease of application, reduced time-consumption, and requirement of minimal resources. It will also help physicians to conduct efficient diagnoses since many patients with PSP could intially present with ocular symptoms in busy outpatient clinics.
