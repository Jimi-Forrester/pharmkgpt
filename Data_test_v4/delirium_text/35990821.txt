35990821|a|Objective: To investigate the efficacy of donepezil hydrochloride plus olanzapine for senile dementia and its effect on the recovery of cognitive function. Methods: A total of 60 patients with senile dementia admitted to our hospital from April 2020 to July 2021 were recruited and assigned to receive either olanzapine alone (observation group) or donepezil hydrochloride plus olanzapine (experimental group) via the random number table method, with 30 patients in each group. Results: The combined therapy resulted in significantly higher clinical efficacy versus monotherapy of olanzapine (P < 0.05). Before treatment, the difference in the scores of cognitive function between the two groups did not come up to the statistical standard (P > 0.05). Donepezil hydrochloride plus olanzapine was associated with significantly higher scores of cognitive function in patients versus olanzapine alone (P < 0.05). The two groups had a similar incidence of adverse reactions (P > 0.05). Conclusion: Donepezil hydrochloride plus olanzapine substantially enhances the recovery of cognitive function of patients with senile dementia and features a manageable safety. Further trials are, however, required prior to clinical promotion.
