32997416|a|Glioma is the most common form of primary central nervous malignant tumors. Vasculogenic mimicry (VM) is a blood supply channel that is different from endothelial blood vessels in glioma. VM is related to tumor invasion and metastasis. Therefore, it plays an important role to target therapy for glioma VM. Our experimental results showed abnormal expression of UBE2I, PUM2, CEBPD, and DSG2 in glioma cells. The Co-IP and Immunofluorescence staining were used to detect that PUM2 can be modified by SUMO2/3. The interaction between PUM2 and CEBPD mRNA was detected by the RIP assays. The interaction between transcription factor CEBPD and promoter region of DSG2 was detected by the ChIP assays and luciferase assays. The capacity for migration in glioma cells was observed by the laser holographic microscope. The capacity for invasion in glioma cells was detected by Transwell method. The VM in glioma cells was detected by three-dimensional cell culture method. The experimental results found that the upregulation of UBE2I in glioma tissues and cells promotes the SUMOylation of PUM2, which decreases not only the stability of PUM2 protein but also decreases the inhibitory effect of PUM2 on CEBPD mRNA. The upregulation of CEBPD promotes the binding to the upstream promoter region of DSG2 gene, further upregulates the expression of DSG2, and finally promotes the development of glioma VM. In conclusion, this study found that the UBE2I/PUM2/CEBPD/DSG2 played crucial roles in regulating glioma VM. It also provides potential targets and alternative strategies for combined treatment of glioma.
