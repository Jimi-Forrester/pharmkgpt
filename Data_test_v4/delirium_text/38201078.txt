38201078|t|Fermented Tea as a Food with Functional Value-Its Microbiological Profile, Antioxidant Potential and Phytochemical Composition.
38201078|a|Kombucha is a fermented tea drink produced by a symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast, known as SCOBY. Its base has traditionally been black tea, which has been recognized for its health-promoting properties, particularly its antioxidant activity based on its high content of pol-yphenolic compounds. A number of previous studies have demonstrated the equally favourable biochemical and phytochemical composition of green tea. The aim of this study was to analyse and compare the basic biochemical composition, microbiological composition and antioxidant properties of black and green tea-based Kombucha. The green tea-based Kombucha showed a quantitatively more abundant microbial composition (Lactic Acid Bacteria, Acetobacter sp., Yeast), a higher reducing potential (FRAP-4326.58 Fe(II)microM/L) and a higher content of total polyphenols (23.84 mg GAE/100 mL, reducing sugars (3212.00 mg/100 mL) as well as free amino acids (849.00 mg GLY/mL). Kombucha made from black tea, on the other hand, showed a higher anti-oxidant potential (1.17 Trolox (mM) TEAC), neutralising the DPPH radical at 94.33% and ABTS at 97.74%. It also had a higher level of acetic acid (0.08 g/100 mL). Green tea kombucha had a higher scavenging capacity of 90.6% for superoxide radical (O2-) and 69.28% for hydroxyl radical ( OH) than black tea kombucha. In the present study, both kombucha drinks tested were shown to be source of potent antioxidants. In addition, green tea, as a kombucha base, has proven to be as beneficial a raw material that will provide full nutritional and health-promoting values as traditional kombucha.
