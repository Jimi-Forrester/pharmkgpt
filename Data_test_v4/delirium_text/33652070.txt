33652070|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease, in which the accumulation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptide in the extracellular space causes a progressive reduction in cognitive performance. Abeta stimulates active oxygen species generation leading to oxidative stress and neural cell death. Vanillic Acid (VA) is the oxidant form of vanillin widely found in vanilla beans. VA has many properties, such as suppressing apoptosis and eliminating the harmful effects of oxidative stress in animal models. The VA effects on impaired learning and memory in Abeta rats were assessed. Forty adults male Wistar rats were assigned to the following five groups in random: the control, sham (received saline (vehicle) via intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection), Abeta (received Abeta1-40 via ICV injection), VA (50 mg/kg by oral gavage once a day through four weeks), and Abeta + VA (50 mg/kg) groups. Open field test, novel object recognition (NOR) test, Morris water maze (MWM) test, and passive avoidance learning (PAL) task were performed, and finally, we determined the malondialdehyde (MDA), total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and total oxidant status (TOS) levels. Abeta decreased the cognitive memory in NOR, spatial memory in MWM, and passive avoidance memory in PAL tests. In contrast, VA improved learning and memory in the treated group. Abeta significantly increased MDA and TOS and decreased TAC levels, whereas VA treatment significantly reversed TAC, TOS and MDA levels. In conclusion, VA decreased the Abeta effects on learning and memory by suppressing oxidative stress and can be regarded as a neuroprotective substance in AD.
