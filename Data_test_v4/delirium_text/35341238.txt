35341238|t|Morphometry of Corpus Callosum in South Indian Population.
35341238|a|Background: The corpus callosum (CC) is a connecting bridge between two cerebral hemispheres and helps in interhemispheric integration of information. Purpose: The primary objective of the study is to explain the topographical position of CC in relation to the brain in the South Indian population, contributing to the reference values of measurements of CC, which helps in planning surgical interventions. Also, the reference values help in cross-referencing with other populations and ethnic group. Methods: In the study, 40 formalin fixed, full brain specimens were cut in midsagittal plane and CC was measured along with its relation to the brain. The major diameters considered were longitudinal dimension of corpus callosum (LC), distance of CC from frontal pole to genu (AS), distance of CC occipital pole to splenium (PS), and longitudinal dimension of brain (LB) from frontal pole to occipital pole. Results: Pearson's ratio showed a positive correlation between LB and PS (0.61), and also between LB and LC (0.59). The ratio of LC/LB was 0.45 and LC/CD was 0.69, which are stable in all brains studied. Conclusion: The study concludes that CC maintains a stable proportion with its parts (genu, rostrum, body, and splenium) and with the horizontal dimension of the brain. Further, measured values help in cross-referencing with other population.
