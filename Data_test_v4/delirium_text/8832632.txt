8832632|a|There is growing evidence that cytoskeletal instability of neuronal cells is an important step towards tangle formation and subsequent functional disconnection in the AD brain. Sabeluzole, a new drug in clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease (AD), has been shown to slow down the clinical progression of the disease. In a search for the mechanism of action of this compound, the effect of sabeluzole on the neuronal cytoskeleton was investigated. Previous studies have shown that in human TR14 neuroblastoma cells and in rat hippocampal neurons a hyperstimulating medium of kinase activators leads to induction of aberrant tau phosphorylation followed by neurotoxicity. This report documents the attenuation of this neurotoxicity by sabeluzole. By selective permeabilization procedures and quantitative immunocytochemistry we show that the compound is found to preferentially increase the fraction of polymerized tubulin. Evidence is presented that the compound differentially modulates a nocodazole-induced depolymerization in contrast to a cold-induced depolymerization. In the mouse, N4 neuroblastoma cells sabeluzole decreases the spontaneous retraction frequency of neurites and lowers the lateral mobility of the cells. We, therefore, propose that sabeluzole exerts its neuroprotective effect by a stabilization of the neuronal cytoskeleton and that this mechanism provides a completely new approach for treatment in Alzheimer's disease.
