29490466|t|Differences Between Moderate to Severely Cognitively Impaired Fallers Versus Nonfallers in Nursing Homes.
29490466|a|INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to test differences in psychotropic medication, function, physical activity, agitation, resistiveness to care, comorbidities, and depression among moderate to severely cognitively impaired nursing home residents who were fallers versus nonfallers. METHODS: This was a secondary data analysis using baseline data from a randomized controlled trial testing the Function and Behavior Focused Care intervention across 12 nursing homes. The sample included 336 older adults, the majority of whom were female and white. RESULTS: There was a significant difference in the total number of comorbidities, agitation, the total number of psychotropic medications, depressive symptoms, and physical activity between those who fell and those who did not fall (Pillai-Bartlett trace = 4.91; P < .001). DISCUSSION: Findings support prior work except with regard to medication use, cognition, and function. Due to inconsistent findings, additional research is recommended particularly with regard to the use of specific drug groups and medications.
