38678955|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease. Intestinal flora and its metabolism play a significant role in ameliorating central nervous system disorders, including AD, through bidirectional interactions between the gut-brain axis. A naturally occurring alkaloid compound called berberine (BBR) has neuroprotective properties and prevents Abeta-induced microglial activation. Additionally, BBR can suppress the synthesis of Abeta and decrease BACE1 expression. However, it is still unclear if BBR therapy can alleviate AD by changing the gut flora. PURPOSE: In this study, we examined whether a partial alleviation of AD could be achieved with BBR treatment and the molecular mechanisms involved. METHODS: We did this by analyzing alterations in Abeta plaques, neurons, and related neuroinflammation-related markers in the brain and the transcriptome of the mouse brain. The relationship between the intestinal flora of 5xFAD model mice and BBR treatment was investigated using high-throughput sequencing analysis of 16S rRNA from mouse feces. RESULTS: The findings demonstrated that treatment with BBR cleared Abeta plaques, alleviated neuroinflammation, and ameliorated spatial memory dysfunction in AD. BBR significantly alleviated intestinal inflammation, decreased intestinal permeability, and could improve intestinal microbiota composition in 5xFAD mice.
