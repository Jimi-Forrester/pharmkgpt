29968773|a|Sepsis is a systemic inflammatory disorder with organ dysfunction and represents the leading cause of mortality in non-coronary intensive care units. A key player in septic shock is Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Phospholipase (PL)D1 is involved in the regulation of TNF-alpha upon ischemia/reperfusion injury in mice. In this study we analyzed the impact of PLD1 in the regulation of TNF-alpha, inflammation and organ damage in experimental sepsis. PLD1 deficiency increased survival of mice and decreased vital organ damage after LPS injections. Decreased TNF-alpha plasma levels and reduced migration of leukocytes and platelets into lungs was associated with reduced apoptosis in lung and liver tissue of PLD1 deficient mice. PLD1 deficient platelets contribute to preserved outcome after LPS-induced sepsis because platelets exhibit an integrin activation defect suggesting reduced platelet activation in PLD1 deficient mice. Furthermore, reduced thrombin generation of PLD1 deficient platelets might be responsible for reduced fibrin formation in lungs suggesting reduced disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The analysis of Pld1fl/fl-PF4-Cre mice revealed that migration of neutrophils and cell apoptosis in septic animals is not due to platelet-mediated processes. The present study has identified PLD1 as a regulator of innate immunity that may be a new target to modulate sepsis.
