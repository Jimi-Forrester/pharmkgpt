37216434|t|Complications Associated with Preventive Management to Reduce the Risk of COVID-19 Spread After Surgery for Spinal Cord Injury.
37216434|a|BACKGROUND: Preventive management to reduce the risk of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) spread led to delays in active rehabilitation, which may have negatively impacted the outcomes of patients with traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI). Therefore, the aim of this study was to clarify the influence of preventive management on the rate of perioperative complications after surgical treatment for SCI. METHODS: This single-center retrospective study examined the cases of 175 patients who had SCI surgery between 2017 and 2021. We could not continue early rehabilitation interventions starting on April 30, 2020, because of our preventive management to reduce the risk of COVID-19 spread. Using a propensity score-matched model, we adjusted for age, sex, American Spinal Injury Association impairment scale score at admission, and risk factors for perioperative complications described in previous studies. Perioperative complication rates were compared between the COVID-19 pandemic and prepandemic groups. RESULTS: Of the 175 patients, 48 (the pandemic group) received preventive management. The preliminary analysis revealed significant differences between the unmatched pandemic and prepandemic groups with respect to age (75.0 versus 71.2 years, respectively; p = 0.024) and intraoperative estimated blood loss (152 versus 227 mL; p = 0.013). The pandemic group showed significant delays in visiting the rehabilitation room compared with the prepandemic group (10 versus 4 days from hospital admission; p < 0.001). There were significant differences between the pandemic and prepandemic groups with respect to the rates of pneumonia (31% versus 16%; p = 0.022), cardiopulmonary dysfunction (38% versus 18%; p = 0.007), and delirium (33% versus 13%; p = 0.003). With a propensity score-matched analysis (C-statistic = 0.90), 30 patients in the pandemic group and 60 patients in the prepandemic group were automatically selected. There were significant differences between the matched pandemic and prepandemic groups with respect to the rates of cardiopulmonary dysfunction (47% versus 23%; p = 0.024) and deep venous thrombosis (60% versus 35%; p = 0.028). CONCLUSIONS: Even with early surgical intervention, late mobilization and delays in active rehabilitation during the COVID-19 pandemic increased perioperative complications after SCI surgery.
