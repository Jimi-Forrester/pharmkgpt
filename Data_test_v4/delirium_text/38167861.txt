38167861|a|This study aimed to evaluate the effects of the enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) program on postoperative recovery of patients who underwent free fibula flap surgery for mandibular reconstruction. This retrospective study included 188 patients who underwent free fibula flap surgery for complex mandibular and soft tissue defects between January 2011 and December 2022. We divided them into two groups: the ERAS group, consisting of 36 patients who were treated according to the ERAS program introduced from 2021 to 2022. Propensity score matching was used for the non-ERAS group, which comprised 36 cases selected from 152 patients between 2011 and 2020, based on age, sex, and smoking history. After propensity score matching, the ERAS and non-ERAS groups included 36 patients each. The primary outcome was the length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay; the secondary outcomes were flap complications, unplanned reoperation, 30-day readmission, postoperative ventilator use length, surgical site infections, incidence of delirium within ICU, lower-limb comorbidities, and morbidity parameters. There were no significant differences in the demographic characteristics of the patients. However, the ERAS group showed the lower length of intensive care unit stay (ERAS vs non-ERAS: 8.66 +- 3.90 days vs. 11.64 +- 5.42 days, P = 0.003) and post-operative ventilator use days (ERAS vs non-ERAS: 1.08 +- 0.28 days vs. 2.03 +- 1.05 days, P < 0.001). Other secondary outcomes were not significantly different between the two groups. Additionally, patients in the ERAS group had lower postoperative morbidity parameters, such as postoperative nausea, vomiting, urinary tract infections, and pulmonary complications (P = 0.042). The ERAS program could be beneficial and safe for patients undergoing free fibula flap surgery for mandibular reconstruction, thereby improving their recovery and not increasing flap complications and 30-day readmission.
