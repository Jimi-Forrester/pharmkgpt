37576214|a|The structural properties and characteristics of date palm fiber-based low-cost carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and nanostructured powder activated carbon (DP-NPAC) are investigated. The DP-NPAC and CNTs are prepared using an environmentally friendly method, and characterized and analyzed using field emission-scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The results have showed that both DP-NPAC and CNTs possess crystallite structure, nano-scale, high capacity, cost-effective for multi-application that make them efficient for future fabrication and manufacturing. It is supposed that DP-NPAC biomass is to be used as potential and cost-effective precursor for synthesized CNTs.
