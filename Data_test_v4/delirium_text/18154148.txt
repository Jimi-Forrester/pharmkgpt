18154148|a|AIM: To specify clinical typology and develop therapeutic approaches to somatogenic psychoses (SP) in hematologic malignancy (HM). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Clinical assessment was made in 118 patients with SP corresponding to diagnostic rubric F05 or F06 in International Disease Classification 10. RESULTS: Three types of SP in HM were identified: delirium (n = 73, 61.9%), aberration and somatogenically provoked attacks of schizophrenia (n = 7, 5.9%). Clinical picture and conditions of the above diseases onset in HM patients are described. Delirium developing in HM is characterized by subclinical psychoses, endogenomorphic psychoses. Endogenomorphic psychoses in the sample were represented by hallucinative-paranoid and depressive- delirious psychoses. CONCLUSION: SP classification proposed directly influences the choice of treatment methods. Psychotropic drugs with known clinical activity with wide-spectrum therapeutic action are effective in the above patients.
