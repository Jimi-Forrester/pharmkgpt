25602932|t|Synthesis and pharmacological evaluation of benzannulated derivatives as potent and selective sigma-1 protein ligands.
25602932|a|The sigma1 proteins are considered to be a new class of target structures for several central nervous system disorders, including depression, anxiety, psychosis, and Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. Recently, the involvement of these receptors in neuropathic pain and cancer has also been observed. So far, only a few ligands are in clinical trials. In a continuation of our previous studies on the development of sigma1 ligands, a new series of benzannulated heterocycles was designed and synthesised. In vitro competition binding assays showed that many of them possessed high sigma1 receptor affinity (Ki = 0.6-10.3 nM), and good sigma2/sigma1 subtype selectivity, without cytotoxic effects on SY5Y cells (human neuroblastoma cell line).
