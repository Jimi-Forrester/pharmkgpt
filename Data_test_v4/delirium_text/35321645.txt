Despite the importance of ADL performance for the consequence of frailty, movement analyses based on kinematic markers during the performance of complex upper extremity-based manual ADL tasks in frail elderly is still pending. The main objective of this study was to evaluate if ADL task performance of two different tasks in frail elderlies can be assessed by an activity measurement based on an acceleration sensor integrated into a smartwatch, and further to what degree kinematic parameters would be task independent. METHODS: ADL data was obtained from twenty-seven elderly participants (mean age 81.6 +- 7.0 years) who performed two ADL tasks. Acceleration data of the dominant hand was collected using a smartwatch. Participants were split up in three groups, F (frail, n = 6), P (pre-frail, n = 13) and R (robust, n = 8) according to a frailty screening. A variety of kinematic measures were calculated from the vector product reflecting activity, agility, smoothness, energy, and intensity. RESULTS: Measures of agility, smoothness, and intensity revealed significant differences between the groups (effect sizes combined over tasks eta2p = 0.18 - 0.26). Smoothness was particularly affected by frailty in the tea making task, while activity, agility, a different smoothness parameter and two intensity measures were related to frailty in the gardening task. Four of nine parameters revealed good reliability over both tasks (r = 0.44 - 0.69). Multiple linear regression for the data combined across tasks showed that only the variability of the magnitude of acceleration peaks (agility) contributed to the prediction of the frailty score (R2 = 0.25). CONCLUSION: The results demonstrate that ADL task performance can be assessed by smartwatch-based measures and further shows task-independent differences between the three levels of frailty. From the pattern of impaired and preserved performance parameters across the tested tasks, we concluded that in persons with frailty ADL performance was more impaired by physiological deficiencies, i.e., physical power and endurance, than by cognitive functioning or sensorimotor control.
