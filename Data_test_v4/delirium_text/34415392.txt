34415392|t|Identification of volatile compounds from bacteria by spectrometric methods in medicine diagnostic and other areas: current state and perspectives.
34415392|a|Diagnosis of bacterial infections until today mostly relies on conventional microbiological methods. The resulting long turnaround times can lead to delayed initiation of adequate antibiotic therapy and prolonged periods of empiric antibiotic therapy (e.g., in intensive care medicine). Therewith, they contribute to the mortality of bacterial infections and the induction of multidrug resistances. The detection of species specific volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by bacteria has been proposed as a possible diagnostic approach with the potential to serve as an innovative point-of-care diagnostic tool with very short turnaround times. A range of spectrometric methods are available which allow the detection and quantification of bacterial VOCs down to a range of part per trillion. This narrative review introduces the application of spectrometric analytical methods for the purpose of detecting VOCs of bacterial origin and their clinical use for diagnosing different infectious conditions over the last decade. KEY POINTS:   Detection of VOCs enables bacterial differentiation in various medical conditions.   Spectrometric methods may function as point-of-care diagnostics in near future.
