38652478|t|Cognitive Training for Reduction of Delirium in Patients Undergoing Cardiac Surgery: A Randomized Clinical Trial.
38652478|a|IMPORTANCE: Postoperative delirium is a common and impactful neuropsychiatric complication in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting surgery. Cognitive training may enhance cognitive reserve, thereby reducing postoperative delirium. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether preoperative cognitive training reduces the incidence of delirium in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. DESIGN, SETTING, and PARTICIPANTS: This prospective, single-blind, randomized clinical trial was conducted at 3 university teaching hospitals in southeastern China with enrollment between April 2022 and May 2023. Eligible participants included those scheduled for elective coronary artery bypass grafting who consented and enrolled at least 10 days before surgery. INTERVENTIONS: Participating patients were randomly assigned 1:1, stratified by site, to either routine care or cognitive training, which included substantial practice with online tasks designed to enhance cognitive functions including memory, imagination, reasoning, reaction time, attention, and processing speed. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was occurrence of delirium during postoperative days 1 to 7 or until hospital discharge, diagnosed using the Confusion Assessment Method or the Confusion Assessment Method for Intensive Care Units. Secondary outcomes were postoperative cognitive dysfunction, delirium characteristics, and all-cause mortality within 30 days following the operation. RESULTS: A total of 218 patients were randomized and 208 (median [IQR] age, 66 [58-70] years; 64 female [30.8%] and 144 male [69.2%]) were included in final analysis, with 102 randomized to cognitive training and 106 randomized to routine care. Of all participants, 95 (45.7%) had only a primary school education and 54 (26.0%) had finished high school. In the cognitive training group, 28 participants (27.5%) developed delirium compared with 46 participants (43.4%) randomized to routine care. Those receiving cognitive training were 57% less likely to develop delirium compared with those receiving routine care (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.43; 95% CI, 0.23-0.77; P = .007). Significant differences were observed in the incidence of severe delirium (aOR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.25-0.82; P = .01), median (IQR) duration of delirium (0 [0-1] days for cognitive training vs 0 [0-2] days for routine care; P = .008), and median (IQR) number of delirium-positive days (0 [0-1] days for cognitive training vs 0 [0-2] days for routine care; P = .007). No other secondary outcomes differed significantly. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized trial of 208 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting, preoperative cognitive training reduced the incidence of postoperative delirium. However, our primary analysis was based on fewer than 75 events and should therefore be considered exploratory and a basis for future larger trials.
