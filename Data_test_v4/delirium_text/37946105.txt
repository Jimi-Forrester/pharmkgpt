37946105|t|Identification of ferroptosis-related genes in acute phase of temporal lobe epilepsy based on bioinformatic analysis.
37946105|a|BACKGROUND: Epilepsy is a prevalent neurological disorder, and while its precise mechanism remains elusive, a connection to ferroptosis has been established. This study investigates the potential clinical diagnostic significance of ferroptosis-related genes (FRGs) during the acute phase of temporal lobe epilepsy. METHODS: To identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs), we accessed data from the GEO database and performed an intersection analysis with the FerrDB database to pinpoint FRGs. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed. To assess the diagnostic utility of the discovered feature genes for the disease, ROC curve analysis was conducted. Subsequently, qRT-PCR was employed to validate the expression levels of these feature genes. RESULTS: This study identified a total of 25 FRGs. PPI network analysis revealed six feature genes: IL6, PTGS2, HMOX1, NFE2L2, TLR4, and JUN. ROC curve analysis demonstrated that the combination of these six feature genes exhibited the highest diagnostic potential. qRT-PCR validation confirmed the expression of these feature genes. CONCLUSION: We have identified six feature genes (IL6, PTGS2, HMOX1, NFE2L2, TLR4, and JUN) strongly associated with ferroptosis in epilepsy, suggesting their potential as biomarkers for the diagnosis of temporal lobe epilepsy.
