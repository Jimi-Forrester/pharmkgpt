35366803|a|BACKGROUND: The ABO and RhD blood group represent antigens on the surface of erythrocytes. The ABO blood group antigens are also present on multiple other cells. Interestingly, previous studies have demonstrated associations between the blood group and many types of disease. The present study aimed to identifying associations between the ABO blood group, the RhD blood group, and morbidity and mortality in a mixed cohort and in six pre-defined subgroups of critically ill patients. METHODS: Adult patients admitted to any of the five intensive care units (ICUs) in the Scania Region, Sweden, between February 2007 and April 2021 were eligible for inclusion. The outcomes were mortality analysed at 28- and 90-days as well as at the end of observation and morbidity measured using days alive and free of (DAF) invasive ventilation (DAF ventilation) and DAF circulatory support, including vasopressors or inotropes (DAF circulation), maximum Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score (SOFAmax) the first 28 days after admission and length of stay. All outcomes were analysed in separate multivariable regression models adjusted for age and sex. In addition, in a sensitivity analysis, five subgroups of patients with the main diagnoses sepsis, septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome, cardiac arrest and trauma were analysed using the same separate multivariable regression models. RESULTS: In total, 29,512 unique patients were included in the analyses. There were no significant differences for any of the outcomes between non-O blood groups and blood group O, or between RhD blood groups. In the sensitivity analysis of subgroups, there were no differences in mortality between non-O blood groups and blood group O or between the RhD blood groups. AB was the most common blood group in the COVID-19 cohort. CONCLUSIONS: The ABO and RhD blood group do not influence mortality or morbidity in a general critically ill patient population.
