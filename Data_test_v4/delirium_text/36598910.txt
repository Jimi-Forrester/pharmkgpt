36598910|a|PURPOSE: Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is the standard of care in advanced prostate cancer. We conducted a Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) study to evaluate the association between ADT and fracture risk in patient with prostate cancer in Taiwan. METHODS: Between 2001 and 2008, data from the Taiwan NHIRD was collected. We separated newly diagnosed prostate cancer patients into four groups: the injection of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists and antagonists group, the orchiectomy group, the oral antiandorgens group and the radical prostatectomy only group. A non-cancer matched control group was also assigned for comparison. T tests, chi-squared tests, multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression were performed. A subsequent fracture event was defined according to the appropriate diagnosis codes (ICD9-CM 800-829) with hospitalization. Patients with fracture before their diagnosis with prostate cancer were excluded. RESULTS: Overall, 22517 newly diagnosed patients with prostate cancer were enrolled in the study. After exclusion criteria were applied, 13321 patients were separated into the injection group (5020 subjects), the orchiectomy group (1193 subjects), the oral group (6059 subjects) and the radical prostatectomy only group (1049 subjects). The mean age of the overall study population was 74.4 years. Multi-variant analysis disclosed a significantly increased risk of fracture in the injection group, the orchiectomy group, and the oral group (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.55, 95%, confidence interval [CI] 1.36 to 1.76, p<0.001, HR = 1.95, 95%, CI 1.61 to 2.37, p<0.001, HR = 1.37, 95%, CI 1.22 to 1.53, p<0.001, respectively). In contrast, a significantly decreased fracture risk was noted in the radical prostatectomy only group (HR = 0.51, 95%, CI 0.35 to 0.74, p = 0.001). Patients receiving osteoporosis medication had a significantly decreased fracture risk (HR = 0.26, 95%, CI 0.19-0.37, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: ADT is associated with an increased risk of fracture. For patients receiving long-term prostate cancer castration therapy, doctors should always keep this complication in mind and arrange proper monitoring and provide timely osteoporosis medication.
