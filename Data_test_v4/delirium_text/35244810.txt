35244810|t|Strategies and tactics to perform safe pancreaticoduodenectomy for 94-year-old patient: report of a case.
35244810|a|BACKGROUND: Despite improvement of postoperative management, pancreatoduodenectomy still has a high rate of major complications. Therefore, careful assessment is critically important when we consider high risk surgery for extremely elderly patients. CASE PRESENTATION: A 94-year-old man, who suffered dark urine, epigastric pain, and loss of appetite, was diagnosed as bile duct cancer and underwent endoscopic retrograde biliary drainage. He has past history of hypertension and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Computed tomography (CT) showed a nodule in the lower bile duct, which was slowly enhanced by dynamic CT. The patient was evaluated whether he overcomes pancreatoduodenectomy by cardiac ultrasonography, brain magnetic resonance angiography, nutritional evaluation (rapid turnover proteins), and CT-based general assessment, including sarcopenia and osteopenia. The patient was independent in activities of daily living and has enough ejection fraction of 65%, and examinations revealed no impairment of cognitive function, sarcopenia, and osteopenia. With a diagnosis of bile duct cancer with no distant metastasis, the patient underwent subtotal stomach-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy with lymph node dissection. Operation time was 299 min and estimated blood loss was 100 ml. Pathological examination revealed papillary adenocarcinoma of the bile duct (pT3N1M0 Stage IIIB). Enteral nutrition was given through jejunostomy and then the patient started oral intake after an evaluation of swallowing function. Postoperative course was uneventful and all drains including pancreatic duct stent, biliary stent, and jejunostomy were removed by 3 weeks after operation. The levels of rapid turnover proteins dropped at postoperative day 7, but recovered at 1 month after operation via appropriate nutrition and rehabilitation. He remains well with no evidence of tumor recurrence as of 1 year after resection. CONCLUSIONS: We herein report successfully treated cases of bile duct cancer in 94-year-old patient by pancreatoduodenectomy with careful evaluation of osteopenia, sarcopenia and nutrition.
