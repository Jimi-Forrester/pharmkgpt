33185609|a|BACKGROUND: Hypertensive arteriopathy (HA) and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) may contribute to the development of mixed cerebral microbleeds (CMBs). Recently, the total small vessel disease (SVD) scores for HA and CAA were proposed, which are determined by a combination of MRI markers to reflect overall severity of these microangiopathies. OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether or not total HA-SVD and CAA-SVD scores could be used to predict overlap of HA and CAA in patients with mixed CMBs. METHODS: Fifty-three subjects with mixed CMBs were retrospectively analyzed. MRI markers (CMBs, lacunes, perivascular space, white matter hyperintensity [WMH] and cortical superficial siderosis [cSS]) were assessed. The HA-SVD score and CAA-SVD score were obtained for each subject. Anterior or posterior WMH was also assessed using the age-related white matter changes scale. RESULTS: The two scores were positively correlated (rho= 0.449, p < 0.001). The prevalence of lobar dominant CMB distribution (p < 0.001) and lacunes in the centrum semiovale (p < 0.001) and the severity of WMH in the parieto-occipital lobes (p = 0.004) were significantly higher in the high CAA-SVD score group. cSS was found in four patients with high CAA-SVD score who showed lobar-dominant CMB distribution and severe posterior WMH. CONCLUSION: Mixed CMBs are mainly due to HA. Assessing both two scores may predict the overlap of HA and CAA in individuals with mixed CMBs. Patients with a high CAA-SVD score may have some degree of advanced CAA, especially when lobar predominant CMBs, severe posterior WMH, lobar lacunes, or cSS are observed.
