10485571|a|Little is known about the person behind the eponymous dementia, Alois Alzheimer. We wished to study his life and contributions to the field of neuroscience. All cited articles about Alzheimer by his contemporaries and selected correspondence by him was translated from German. Additional personal information was obtained from his granddaughter. Alois Alzheimer made seminal contributions to the field of neuroscience, not only through his own research but also through the numerous scientists and physicians whom he taught. His contributions made a lasting impact not only in the area of Alzheimer disease but also other aspects of brain disease. In addition, he emerges as a complex person who coped successfully with numerous personal and career-related dilemmas that remain relevant in the academic environment today.
