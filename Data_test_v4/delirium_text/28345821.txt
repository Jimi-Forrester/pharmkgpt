28345821|a|Background: Excessive production of oxygen free radicals and imbalance in the mechanisms responsible forantioxidant protection may result in the onset of many diseases including breast cancer. Objective: To evaluateantiproliferative and antioxidant activity of an ethylacetate fraction (EAF) of Picria fel-terrae Lour. Herbs in the T47Dcell line. Methods: Phenolic and total flavonoid contents in EAF were determined. EAF was tested for cytotoxicity andeffects on the cell cycle and apoptosis, as well as antioxidant activity. Results: EAF was found to contain high levels ofphenolic agents (92.88 +- 0.50 mg GAE/g), total flavonoid (84.39 +- 0.07 mg QE/g). The EAF of Picria fel-terrae Lour.herbs was found to have an IC50 of 62.98mug/mL, caused accumulation in G0-G1 and S phase and increased early andlate apoptosis. Antioxidant activity in DPPH assays gave an IC50 of 166.90 +- 0.10 mug/mL. Conclusions: The resultsreveal that EAF of Picria fel-terrae Lour. herbs has antiproliferative activity and strong antioxidant potential. Furtherstudies are now needed to isolate the responsible antiproliferative and antioxidant components.
