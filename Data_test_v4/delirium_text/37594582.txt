37594582|a|Copper performs an important role in the brain, but in high levels it can be neurotoxic. Further, some authors have described that copper dyshomeostasis could be related with neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, this review was performed to observe whether high copper levels are related to Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases (AD and PD), using the literature published recently. Articles that measured copper levels in AD or PD patients was included, as well as they that measured copper levels in models used to mimic these diseases. Also, results about high copper levels effects and its relationship with AD and PD observed in laboratory animals are considered. In summary, 38 and 24 articles with AD and PD patients were included, respectively. Despite of the heterogeneity between the studies in humans, meta-analysis has demonstrated that there is an increase in free and total copper levels in the blood of AD patients compared to controls, and a decrease in copper levels in PD patients. A decrease in the metal content in postmortem brain tissue was observed in AD and PD. In manuscripts using animal models that mimic AD and PD, it was included seven and three articles, respectively. Two of them have reported an increase in copper concentrations in AD model, and one in PD model. Finally, studies with laboratory animals have concluded that high copper levels are related to oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, changes in neurotransmitter levels, cell death, and reduced both cognitive and locomotor activity, which are also described in AD or PD.
