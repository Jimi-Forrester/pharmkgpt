39436582|t|The Association Between Constipation and Positron Emission Tomography and Blood-Based Biomarkers in Older Cognitively Unimpaired Adults with Higher Amyloid-beta Burden.
39436582|a|INTRODUCTION: Constipation may be linked to cognitive decline and a higher risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We aimed to investigate the association between constipation and positron emission tomography (PET) and blood-based AD biomarkers in older cognitively unimpaired (CU) adults with higher Abeta burden. METHODS: Constipation was diagnosed according to Rome IV criteria and the severity of constipation was evaluated by using a validated self-reported questionnaire. The participants underwent the examination of plasma AD biomarkers and 18F-florbetapir PET and 18F-MK6240 PET scans; the latter was only performed in the validation cohort. Correlation and multiple linear regression analyses were used to investigate the association between constipation and AD biomarkers. RESULTS: Two cohorts were included in our study. A total of 404 older participants with 126 of whom Abeta-PET positive were enrolled in the development cohort. Multiple linear regression analysis showed constipation was associated with plasma t-Tau, p-Tau-181, and neurofilament light chain (NfL) in participants with Abeta-PET (+). Meanwhile, no/mild constipation was associated with lower Abeta-PET standard uptake value ratio. The association between constipation and plasma biomarkers was different in the subgroups stratified by age, sex and APOE epsilon4 genotype. The above associations were further validated in the validation cohort containing 36 Abeta-PET (+) participants. Importantly, no/mild constipation was associated with less Tau burden evaluated by 18F-MK6240 PET Braak stages. CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that no/mild constipation may be associated with lower plasma t-Tau, p-Tau-181, and NfL as well as less Abeta and Tau burden in older CU adults with Abeta deposition. Improving constipation and being away from defecation disorders may help reduce the risk of AD development.
