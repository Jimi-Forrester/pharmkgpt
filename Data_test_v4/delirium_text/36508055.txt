36508055|t|Inpatient GHB withdrawal management in an inner-city hospital in Sydney, Australia: a retrospective medical record review.
36508055|a|RATIONALE: Regular consumption of gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) may result in a dependence syndrome that can lead to withdrawal symptoms. There are limited data on medications to manage GHB withdrawal. OBJECTIVES: To examine characteristics associated with delirium and discharge against medical advice (DAMA), in the context of implementing a GHB withdrawal management protocol at an inner-city hospital in 2020. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed records (01 January 2017-31 March 2021), and included admissions that were >= 18 years of age, admitted for GHB withdrawal, and with documented recent GHB use. Admissions were assessed for demographics, medications administered, features of delirium, ICU admission, and DAMA. Exploratory analyses were conducted to examine factors associated (p < 0.2) with features of delirium and DAMA. RESULTS: We identified 135 admissions amongst 91 patients. Medications administered included diazepam (133 admissions, 98.5%), antipsychotics (olanzapine [70 admissions, 51.9%]), baclofen (114 admissions, 84%), and phenobarbital (8 admissions, 5.9%). Features of delirium were diagnosed in 21 (16%) admissions. Delirium was associated with higher daily GHB consumption prior to admission, while duration of GHB use, time from presentation to first dose of diazepam, and concomitant methamphetamine use were inversely associated with delirium. DAMA occurred amongst 41 (30%) admissions, and was associated with a longer time from presentation to first dose of baclofen, while being female and receiving a loading dose of diazepam were inversely associated. CONCLUSIONS: This study adds to the literature in support of the safety and feasibility of diazepam and baclofen for the management of GHB withdrawal. Prospective, randomised trials are required.
