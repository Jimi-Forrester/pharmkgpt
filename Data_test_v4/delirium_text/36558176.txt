36558176|t|Phytochemical Compounds and Nanoparticles as Phytochemical Delivery Systems for Alzheimer's Disease Management.
36558176|a|Alzheimer's disease remains one of the most widespread neurodegenerative reasons for dementia worldwide and is associated with considerable mortality and morbidity. Therefore, it has been considered a priority for research. Indeed, several risk factors are involved in the complexity of the therapeutic ways of this pathology, including age, traumatic brain injury, genetics, exposure to aluminum, infections, diabetes, vascular diseases, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and obesity. The pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease is mostly associated with hyperphosphorylated protein in the neuronal cytoplasm and extracellular plaques of the insoluble beta-amyloid peptide. Therefore, the management of this pathology needs the screening of drugs targeting different pathological levels, such as acetylcholinesterase (AchE), amyloid beta formation, and lipoxygenase inhibitors. Among the pharmacological strategies used for the management of Alzheimer's disease, natural drugs are considered a promising therapeutic strategy. Indeed, bioactive compounds isolated from different natural sources exhibit important anti-Alzheimer effects by their effectiveness in promoting neuroplasticity and protecting against neurodegeneration as well as neuroinflammation and oxidative stress in the brain. These effects involve different sub-cellular, cellular, and/or molecular mechanisms, such as the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AchE), the modulation of signaling pathways, and the inhibition of oxidative stress. Moreover, some nanoparticles were recently used as phytochemical delivery systems to improve the effects of phytochemical compounds against Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, the present work aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the key advances concerning nano-drug delivery applications of phytochemicals for Alzheimer's disease management.
