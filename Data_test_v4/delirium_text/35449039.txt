35449039|a|BACKGROUND: The use of standard screening methods could improve the detection rate of unhealthy alcohol use in patients admitted to psychiatric acute and emergency departments. The aim of the present study was to investigate the ability of the alcohol biomarker phosphatidylethanol (PEth) to identify patients with high levels of alcohol consumption prior to admission. METHODS: The data were prospectively collected at admittance to an acute psychiatric department in the period January 2016 to June 2017. A blood sample for the analysis of PEth was available from 177 patients. We compared the PEth concentrations with the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) scores during the hospital stay, and psychiatric diagnoses at discharge. RESULTS: A total of 45.8% of the patients had a PEth concentration >= 0.03 mumol/L, indicating significant alcohol consumption. AUDIT scores consistent with unhealthy alcohol use were present in 51.7%. There was a significant positive correlation between PEth concentrations and AUDIT scores (r = 0.631, p < 0.001). PEth was above the detection limit of 0.03 mumol/L in 19% of those reporting an average daily intake of zero alcohol units per day during the last week before admission. PEth concentrations were significantly higher among those with an alcohol diagnosis than among those without such a diagnosis (0.82 mumol/L vs. 0.09 mumol/L, p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: PEth provides supplementary information on recent alcohol consumption in a psychiatric population and would be particularly helpful in patients unable or unwilling to give such information at admission.
