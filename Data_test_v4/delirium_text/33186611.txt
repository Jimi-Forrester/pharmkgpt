33186611|a|Neuroinflammation is a complex response to brain injury involving the activation of glia, release of inflammatory mediators, such as cytokines and chemokines, and generation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. Even though it is considered an event secondary to neuronal death or dysfunction, neuro-inflammation comprises a majority of the non-neuronal contributors to the cause and progression of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Parkinson's Disease (PD), Multiple Sclerosis (MS), Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) and others. As a result of the lack of effectiveness of current treatments for neurodegenerative diseases, neuroinflammation has become a legitimate therapeutic target for drug discovery, leading to the study of various in vivo and in vitro models of neuroinflammation. Several molecules sourced from plants have displayed anti-inflammatory properties in the study of neurodegenerative diseases. A group of these anti-inflammatory compounds has been classified as cytokine-suppressive anti-inflammatory drugs (CSAIDs), which target the pro-inflammatory AP1 and nuclear factor-kappaB signaling pathways and inhibit the expression of many pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin IL-1, IL-6, TNF-alpha, or nitric oxide. Australian plants, thriving amid the driest inhabited continent of the world, are an untapped source of chemical diversity in the form of secondary metabolites. These compounds are produced in response to biotic and abiotic stresses that the plants are exposed to in the highly biodiverse environment. This review is an attempt to highlight anti-inflammatory compounds isolated from Australian plants.
