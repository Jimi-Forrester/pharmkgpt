15981904|a|People with MCI suffer from a moderate memory impairment, from deficits in attention and cognitive flexibility but do not fulfil the diagnostic criteria of dementia. These patients feel forgetful, and sometimes may have problems with their jobs and families because of their forgetfulness. In many cases (10-15% per year), MCI is leading to Alzheimer's disease. The sooner MCI is diagnosed and treated, the better the transition into Alzheimer's disease may perhaps be delayed. The diagnostic instruments are the same as for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease: biomarkers of the cerebrospinal fluid, neuroimaging and neuropsychological testing. Neuropsychological testing already shows deficits, even when neuroimaging findings still seem to be normal. Therapy of MCI is basically like the treatment of Alzheimer's disease: symptomatic treatment with cholinesterase-inhibitors or antioxidants, and compensatory psychological approaches.
