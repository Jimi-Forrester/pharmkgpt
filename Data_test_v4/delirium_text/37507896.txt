37507896|t|In Vitro Digestion of Peanut Skin Releases Bioactive Compounds and Increases Cancer Cell Toxicity.
37507896|a|Peanut skin is a rich source of bioactive compounds which may be able to reduce the risk factors associated with metabolic syndromes. This study aimed to characterize bio-compounds from peanut skin (Arachis hypogaea) and their bioactivity (antioxidant activity, inhibition of lipase, and carbohydrase enzymes) and to evaluate their anti-proliferative properties in colorectal cancer cells (HCT116) upon in vitro digestion. Peanut skin was digested in two sequential phases, and the final content, named phase-1 (P1) and phase-2 (P2) extracts, was evaluated. Several bioactive compounds were positively identified and quantified by liquid chromatography, including quinic acid, released especially after in vitro digestion. The total phenolic content and, regardless of the method, the antioxidant activity of P1 was higher than P2. P1 also showed a lower enzyme inhibitory concentration IC50 than P2, lipase, and alpha-glucosidase. For cell viability in HCT116 cells, lower concentrations of P1 were found for IC50 compared to P2. In conclusion, bioactive compounds were released mainly during the first phase of the in vitro digestion. The digested samples presented antioxidant activity, enzyme inhibitory activity, and cancer cell cytotoxicity, especially those from the P1 extract. The potential applications of such a by-product in human health are reported.
