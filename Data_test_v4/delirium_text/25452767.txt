25452767|t|Evaluating the relationship between amyloid-beta and alpha-synuclein phosphorylated at Ser129 in dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson's disease.
25452767|a|INTRODUCTION: Lewy body and Alzheimer-type pathologies often co-exist. Several studies suggest a synergistic relationship between amyloid-beta (Abeta) and alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) accumulation. We have explored the relationship between Abeta accumulation and the phosphorylation of alpha-syn at serine-129 (pSer129 alpha-syn), in post-mortem human brain tissue and in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells transfected to overexpress human alpha-syn. METHODS: We measured levels of Abeta40, Abeta42, alpha-syn and pSer129 alpha-syn by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, in soluble and insoluble fractions of midfrontal, cingulate and parahippocampal cortex and thalamus, from cases of Parkinson's disease (PD) with (PDD; n = 12) and without dementia (PDND; n = 23), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB; n = 10) and age-matched controls (n = 17). We also examined the relationship of these measurements to cognitive decline, as measured by time-to-dementia and the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score in the PD patients, and to Braak tangle stage. RESULTS: In most brain regions, the concentration of insoluble pSer129 alpha-syn correlated positively, and soluble pSer129 alpha-syn negatively, with the levels of soluble and insoluble Abeta. Insoluble pSer129 alpha-syn also correlated positively with Braak stage. In most regions, the levels of insoluble and soluble Abeta and the proportion of insoluble alpha-syn that was phosphorylated at Ser129 were significantly higher in the PD and DLB groups than the controls, and higher in the PDD and DLB groups than the PDND brains. In PD, the MMSE score correlated negatively with the level of insoluble pSer129 alpha-syn. Exposure of SH-SY5Y cells to aggregated Abeta42 significantly increased the proportion of alpha-syn that was phosphorylated at Ser129 (aggregated Abeta40 exposure had a smaller, non-significant effect). CONCLUSIONS: Together, these data show that the concentration of pSer129 alpha-syn in brain tissue homogenates is directly related to the level of Abeta and Braak tangle stage, and predicts cognitive status in Lewy body diseases.
