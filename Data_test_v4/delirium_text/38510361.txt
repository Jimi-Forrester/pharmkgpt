38510361|a|Background: Patients in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) are at high risk of developing delirium. Lack of early detection and the inability to provide prompt management of delirium remain challenges of ICU patient care. This study aimed to assess the level of knowledge, attitude, and associated factors toward delirium among healthcare providers working in ICU. Methods: A multicenter, cross-sectional survey was conducted in comprehensive specialized hospitals from 15 April to 5 June 2023. Data were collected using a pretested, self-administered questionnaire. Ordinal logistic regression analysis was performed at p < 0.05 with a 95% confidence interval (CI). The odds ratio with 95% CI was calculated to determine the strength of the association between independent and outcome variables. Results: A total of 202 health professionals were included in this study, with a response rate of 87%. The proportions of good, moderate, and poor knowledge about delirium in ICU were 29.21 (95% CI: 23-36), 52.48 (95% CI: 45.3-59.5) and 18.32 (95% CI:13.2-24.4), respectively. The overall proportion of negative, neutral and positive attitude were 13.9 (95% CI: 9.4-19.4), 65.8 (95% CI: 58.9-72.4) and 20.3 (95% CI: 15-26.5) respectively. Being an anesthetist and exposure to training were positively associated with a good knowledge while belief in screening tool to change care and reading, and using guidelines were positively associated with a positive attitude. However, believing the impossibility of changing the practice of delirium care, and negative attitudes were delaying factors for a good knowledge. Also, workload and poor knowledge were hindering factors for a positive attitude. Conclusion: More than half of health professionals had moderate knowledge and neutral attitude toward delirium. However, some of them had poor knowledge and a negative attitude. We recommend stakeholders prepare regular training for delirium care. Also, we urge health professionals to update themselves by reading guidelines and to use screening protocols for delirium.
