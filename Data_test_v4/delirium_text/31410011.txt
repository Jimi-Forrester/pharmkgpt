31410011|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Dopamine plays an important role in the disease pathology of Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia. These two neuropsychiatric disorders represent disease end points of the dopaminergic spectrum where Parkinson's disease represents dopamine deficit and schizophrenia represents dopamine hyperactivity in the mid-brain. Therefore, current treatment strategies aim to restore normal dopamine levels. However, during treatment patients develop adverse effects due to overshooting of physiological levels of dopamine leading to psychosis in Parkinson's disease, and extrapyramidal symptoms in schizophrenia. Absence of any laboratory tests hampers modulation of pharmacotherapy. Apolipoprotein E and alpha-synuclein have an important role in the neuropathology of these two diseases. The objective of this study was to evaluate cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of apolipoprotein E and alpha-synuclein in patients with these two diseases so that they may serve as biomarkers to monitor therapy in Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia. METHODS: Drug-naive Parkinson's disease patients and Parkinson's disease patients treated with dopaminergic therapy, neurological controls, schizophrenic patients treated with antidopaminergic therapy, and drug-naive schizophrenic patients were recruited for the study and CSF was collected. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were carried out to estimate the concentrations of apolipoprotein E and alpha-synuclein. Pathway analysis was done to establish a possible role of these two proteins in various pathways in these two dopamine dictated diseases. RESULTS: Apolipoprotein E and alpha-synuclein CSF concentrations have an inverse correlation along the entire dopaminergic clinical spectrum. Pathway analysis convincingly establishes a plausible hypothesis for their co-regulation in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia. Each protein by itself or as a combination has encouraging sensitivity and specificity values of more than 55%. CONCLUSION: The dynamic variation of these two proteins along the spectrum is ideal for them to be pursued as pharmacotherapeutic biomarkers in CSF to monitor pharmacological efficacy in Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia.
