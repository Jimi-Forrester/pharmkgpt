35717152|t|RCAN1-mediated calcineurin inhibition as a target for cancer therapy.
35717152|a|Cancer is the leading cause of mortality worldwide. Regulator of calcineurin 1 (RCAN1), as a patent endogenous inhibitor of calcineurin, plays crucial roles in the pathogenesis of cancers. Except for hypopharyngeal and laryngopharynx cancer, high expression of RCAN1 inhibits tumor progression. Molecular antitumor functions of RCAN1 are largely dependent on calcineurin. In this review, we highlight current research on RCAN1 characteristics, and the interaction between RCAN1 and calcineurin. Moreover, the dysregulation of RCAN1 in various cancers is reviewed, and the potential of targeting RCAN1 as a new therapeutic approach is discussed.
