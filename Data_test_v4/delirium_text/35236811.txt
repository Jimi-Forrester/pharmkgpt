35236811|a|Plasmalogens are a group of glycerophospholipids containing a vinyl-ether bond at the sn-1 position in the glycerol backbone. Cellular membrane plasmalogens are considered to have important roles in homeostasis as endogenous antioxidants, differentiation, and intracellular signal transduction pathways including neural transmission. Therefore, reduced levels of plasmalogens have been suggested to be associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Interestingly, although arachidonic acid is considered to be involved in learning and memory, it could be liberated and excessively activate neuronal activity to the excitotoxic levels seen in Alzheimer's disease patients. Here, we examined the protective effects of several kinds of plasmalogens against cellular toxicity caused by arachidonic acid in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. As a result, only phosphatidylcholine-plasmalogen-oleic acid (PC-PLS-18) showed protective effects against arachidonic acid-induced cytotoxicity based on the results of lactate dehydrogenase release and ATP depletion assays, as well as cellular morphological changes in SH-SY5Y cells. These results indicate that PC-PLS-18 protects against arachidonic acid-induced cytotoxicity, possibly via improving the stability of the cellular membrane in SH-SY5Y cells.
