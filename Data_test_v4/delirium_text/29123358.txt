29123358|t|Chronic Cancer Pain: Diagnostic Dilemma and Management Challenges.
29123358|a|A 32-year-old female, diagnosed case of neuroendocrine tumor of pancreas, was admitted to the pain and palliative care unit with complaints of diffuse abdominal pain which was severe in intensity with score on numerical rating scale-9/10. Pain was not relieved even after taking tablet morphine immediate release 360 mg every 4 hourly, paracetamol 500 mg 6 hourly, and gabapentin 300 mg 8 hourly. She had undergone distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy and also received multiple lines of chemotherapy. After making a diagnosis of opioid-induced hyperalgesia, opioid rotation from morphine to fentanyl was done. This case report reflects various conditions where strong opioids fail to relieve cancer pain, and a multimodal approach is needed for its management.
