39183563|t|Delirium Mediated the Association Between a History of Falls and Short-Term Mortality Risk in Critically Ill Ischemic Stroke Patients.
39183563|a|Patients with ischemic stroke have an increased propensity to fall, resulting in significant physical and psychological distress. This study examined the association between falls in the 3 months prior to intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mortality within 28 days among 2950 adult ICU patients diagnosed with ischemic stroke from 2008 to 2019, focusing on the potential mediating role of delirium. The primary outcomes were short-term mortality (28, 60, and 90 days) and the risk of delirium. Each patient was followed for at least 1 year. Delirium was primarily assessed using the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU and by reviewing nursing notes. Group differences between patients with and without a history of falls were compared using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test or the chi-squared test. Cox proportional risk or logistic regression models were used to explore the association between fall history and outcomes, and causal mediation analysis was performed. Results showed that patients with a recent fall history had a significantly increased risk of 28-day (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.62, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.35-1.94), 60-day (HR: 1.67, 95% CI: 1.42-1.98), and 90-day mortality (HR: 1.66, 95% CI: 1.41-1.95), as well as an increased risk of delirium (odds ratio: 2.00, 95% CI: 1.66-2.42). Delirium significantly mediated the association between fall history and 28-day mortality (total effect: HR: 1.77, 95% CI: 1.45-2.16; natural indirect effect: HR: 1.12, 95% CI: 1.05-1.21; proportion mediated: 24.6%). These findings suggest that ischemic stroke patients with a recent fall have an increased risk of short-term mortality, partly mediated by delirium. Strategies aimed at preventing delirium may potentially improve prognosis in this patient population.
