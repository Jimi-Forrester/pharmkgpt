28259697|a|OBJECTIVE: To determine if antipsychotic (AP) use in Parkinson disease (PD) patients is associated with increased physical morbidity. METHODS: Veterans Health Administration data (1999-2010) was used to examine physical morbidity risk associated with AP use in idiopathic PD patients with stable recent physical health. We compared 180-day morbidity rates in patients initiating an AP with matched non-AP users who survived for 180 days (matched on age, sex, race, index year, presence and duration of dementia, PD duration, delirium, hospitalization, Charlson Comorbidity Index, and new non-psychiatric medications; covarying for psychosis). Outcomes were 180-day emergency department (ED), and inpatient and outpatient visits. RESULTS: There were 6,679 matched PD pairs. Any AP use was associated with an increased risk of ED visit (HR: 1.64, 95% CI: 1.51, 1.77), inpatient care (HR: 1.58, 95% CI: 1.46, 1.71), and outpatient visits (IRR: 1.08, 95% CI: 1.05, 1.12). The risk was significantly higher for atypical AP use compared with nonuse for all three morbidity outcomes, and was similar for atypical and typical AP use. CONCLUSIONS: Any AP use, and atypical AP use, are associated with significantly increased physical morbidity risk in PD patients, as evidenced by increased ED, inpatient, and outpatient visits. These findings, which require replication, extend the risk associated with use of APs in this population from mortality to a broader range of adverse outcomes, and further highlight the need to use APs cautiously in PD patients.
