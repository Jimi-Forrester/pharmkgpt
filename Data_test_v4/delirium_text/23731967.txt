23731967|t|Medication adherence survey of drugs useful in prevention of dementia of Alzheimer's type among Indian patients.
23731967|a|BACKGROUND: Good medication adherence is the cornerstone of therapeutic success. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia and most patients are old and on multiple drugs, and good compliance therefore is even more important in this population. Dementia of Alzheimer's type (DAT) at present is yet to find a cure. Anticholinesterases and N-methyl-D-aspartate blockers are specific anti-AD therapies available. Hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia can contribute to cognitive worsening. Keeping hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia in control can therefore possibly prevent further cognitive decline. METHODS: Patients with subjective memory complaints (n = 75) were chosen randomly. Upon thorough neurological diagnostic work up for dementia, those with mild cognitive impairment/questionable dementia (Clinical Dementia Rating = 0.5) or those with AD were recruited in this study (n = 67). Those with hypertension, diabetes, and deranged lipid profile were further interviewed if they were able to take medicines regularly or not. An attempt was made to know causes of non-compliance. RESULTS: Forty-one percent of patients were not taking the drugs that have potential to prevent cardiovascular complications or ability to slow down cognitive decline in AD on regular basis. The lack of awareness, ignorance, medicines being "too expensive," and the pressure of taking medicines regularly were cited as the reasons for non-compliance. Being illiterate and having low education contributed majorly to poor compliance in this study. CONCLUSION: Compliance to drugs that have potential or real ability to slow down cognitive decline is low in elderly people with DAT.
