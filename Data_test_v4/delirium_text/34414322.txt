34414322|t|Limited Utility of Routine Tests Prior to Ophthalmologic Surgery: An Observational Study in a Japanese Hospital.
34414322|a|INTRODUCTION: Routine preoperative testing for low-risk surgeries without a clinical indication should be avoided; however, such tests are still frequently performed in Japan. This study was performed to assess the impact of routine preoperative tests in low-risk surgery in a Japanese medical setting. METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review to examine the utility of routine tests with respect to anesthetic management and postoperative complications in all patients aged >= 18 years whom ophthalmologists consulted with anesthesiologists before ophthalmologic surgery under general anesthesia. RESULTS: During the 10-year study period, 1,234 anesthetic consultations and 1,211 routine preoperative tests (laboratory tests, chest X-rays, and electrocardiograms) were performed in Toyama University Hospital. In total, 59 patients (4.8% of the study population) canceled surgery after a battery of preoperative evaluation. Among them, 10 patients had incidental abnormalities that necessitated additional tests, and only three patients (0.2%) canceled surgery. In-hospital postoperative complications developed in nine patients (0.7%) whose routine test results made it difficult to predict development of these adverse events. No severe life-threatening events were noted in this survey. CONCLUSIONS: Routine tests prior to eye surgery for adults were of low value for perioperative management and prediction of development of in-hospital complications in this Japanese medical setting. Anesthesiologists and ophthalmologists should selectively order preoperative tests based on the medical interview and physical examination.
