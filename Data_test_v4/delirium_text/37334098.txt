37334098|a|A 36-year-old pregnant woman with a prior history of depression and recent gunshot wounds presented with sudden deterioration in her mental status. Clinical examination revealed psychosis, hallucinations, and lack of orientation, with an otherwise normal neurological and cardiorespiratory examination. Computed tomographic scan of her head was normal, and she was diagnosed with acute psychosis and excited delirium. She did not respond to supraphysiologic dosages of antipsychotic therapy and needed physical restraints for combativeness and agitation. Her cerebrospinal fluid analysis was negative for an infectious etiology, but was positive for anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis antibodies. Abdominal imaging revealed a right-sided ovarian cyst. Subsequently she underwent right-sided oophorectomy. Postoperatively the patient continued to have intermittent episodes of agitation requiring antipsychotic medications. Later, she was safely transitioned to home care with family support.
