38249220|t|Intravascular Lymphoma-Associated Stroke: A Systematic Review of Case Studies.
38249220|a|Intravascular lymphoma (IVL) is an aggressive systemic large B-cell lymphoma that is a rare cause of stroke. The clinical characteristics of stroke associated with IVL remain underexplored, contributing to diagnostic complexities and a high mortality rate. This study endeavors to elucidate the salient clinical and investigative features of stroke linked to this condition. A systematic review was performed using the PubMed database from the incident to August 2023 including search categories for IVL and stroke. All studies, excluding review articles, were included in this study. There were 58 cases with a confirmed diagnosis of IVL associated with stroke, with a mean age of 62.9 +- 9.6 years (female 50%). Classical lateralizing stroke symptoms were noted in only 69% of cases. Other clinical syndromes included altered sensorium (31%), rapidly progressive cognitive impairment (23%), seizures (22%), and gait disturbances (19%). Common hematological abnormalities included elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH, 97%), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR, 79%), C-reactive protein (CRP, 61%), interleukin-2, microglobulins, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein. CSF flow cytometry was not diagnostic, and cytology was mostly negative. The dynamic pattern for DWI/T2 lesions was predominant and primarily located in the subcortical regions. Diffuse background slowing (64%) was a major finding in the electroencephalogram. Seventy-one percent of cases died (n=45) mostly due to delayed diagnosis. Only 31% were treated with first-line R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin hydrochloride, vincristine, prednisone) chemotherapy, among whom 25% died. This study suggests that IVL-associated strokes carry a high mortality rate, largely due to challenges in timely diagnosis and therapy. Unlike classical stroke syndrome, key indicators to aid in early diagnosis include a clinical syndrome of multiple non-lateralizing neurological symptoms, dynamic MRI DWI/T2-lesions primarily located in subcortical regions, elevated serum LDH, ESR, CRP, interleukins, microglobulin, CSF protein, and CSF polymerase chain reaction analysis, apart from tissue examination. Larger studies should be performed to establish diagnostic and predictive scores.
