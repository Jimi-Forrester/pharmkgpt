36088556|a|BACKGROUND: This study aimed to report an aortic pseudoaneurysm, a rare but lethal complication, after a spinal fracture in ankylosing spine. OBSERVATIONS: An 83-year-old obese woman presented with dementia and was nonambulatory after a fall. She was transported to the hospital, and imaging showed a hyperextension-type L1 fracture with diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH). After posterior fusion surgery using percutaneous pedicle screws, screw loosening was detected 10 days postoperatively. Fracture dislocation was reduced by changing to transdiscal screws and rodding while in the lateral position. However, the anterior opening persisted. Enhanced computed tomography performed at 6 weeks postoperatively showed a large aortic pseudoaneurysm extending into the vertebral fracture site without screw loosening. Neither endovascular aortic repair nor open surgery was applicable. The patient was transferred to a sanatorium and died of pneumonia 5 months postoperatively without aortic aneurysm rupture. LESSONS: An aortic pseudoaneurysm can occur in hyperextension-type spinal fractures in DISH, even after fusion surgery, when the edge of the fracture is in contact with the aortic wall. The anterior opening dislocation should be reduced as much as possible.
