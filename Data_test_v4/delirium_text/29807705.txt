29807705|t|The Way of Tau: Secretion and Synaptic Dysfunction.
29807705|a|Tau, a microtubule-associated protein, is linked to many neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). A recent study uncovered a new pathway for its secretion, leading to its transcellular uptake, while another study found that tau secreted from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) modeling trisomy 21-related AD caused synaptic impairment in rats. These findings could inform tau-directed therapies.
