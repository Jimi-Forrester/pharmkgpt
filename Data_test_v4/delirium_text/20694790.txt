20694790|t|[Neurological aspects of chronic heart failure].
20694790|a|Chronic heart failure (CHF) is one of the leading causes of hospitalization, morbidity and mortality. Moreover, there is a high rate of neurological as well as neuropsychological comorbidities, namely ischemic stroke, structural brain alterations, cognitive impairment, sleep apnea and possible side-effects of HF medication such as delirium or (intracerebral) hemorrhage. The higher stroke risk in patients with HF increases further with age, concomitant arterial hypertension or atrial fibrillation (AF). In women the stroke risk increases with reduced ejection fraction (EF). In general stroke in HF patients is associated with a poor outcome and higher mortality, which is increased more than 2-fold. Furthermore, approximately 25-80% of all patients with CHF experience cognitive impairments such as decreased attention and concentration, memory loss, diminished psychomotor reaction time and decreased executive functions. Cognitive impairment in patients with HF has been linked to losses in gray matter, (silent) ischemic strokes, decreased cerebral perfusion and higher mortality. Moreover, sleep apnea occurs in more than half of all patients with CHF and reduced EF. However, prospective studies are needed to test whether early detection and optimal treatment of HF reduces the burden of neurological and neuropsychological sequelae.
