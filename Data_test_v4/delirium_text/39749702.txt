39749702|t|Mitochondrial calcium uniporter complex: An emerging therapeutic target for cardiovascular diseases (Review).
39749702|a|Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is currently a major factor affecting human physical and mental health. In recent years, the relationship between intracellular Ca2+ and CVD has been extensively studied. Ca2+ movement across the mitochondrial inner membrane plays a vital role as an intracellular messenger, regulating energy metabolism and calcium homeostasis. It is also involved in pathological processes such as cardiomyocyte apoptosis, hypertrophy and fibrosis in CVD. The selective mitochondrial calcium uniporter complex (MCU complex) located in the inner membrane is essential for mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake. Therefore, the MCU complex is a potential therapeutic target for CVD. In this review, recent research progress on the pathophysiological mechanisms and therapeutic potential of the MCU complex in various CVDs was summarized, including myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury, pulmonary arterial hypertension, other peripheral vascular diseases, myocardial remodeling and arrhythmias. This review contributes to a deeper understanding of these mechanisms at the molecular level and highlights potential intervention targets for CVD treatment in clinical practice.
