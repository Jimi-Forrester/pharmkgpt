36505580|t|Hypertension among women in reproductive age in India: Can we predict the risk? An analysis from National Family Health Survey (2015-2016).
36505580|a|Background: Hypertension in women of reproductive age group is of special concern because of the vulnerability of women to pregnancy-induced hypertension apart from socio-cultural vulnerability. Aim: The objective of the study was to identify the predictors for hypertension among Indian women and to develop a risk score which would provide an opportunity for early detection and appropriate action. Material and Methods: This study was based on the data collected in National Family Health Survey in 2015-2016. Women in India of 15-49 years were the study population. Data were analysed using SPSS v17. Logistic regression analysis was carried and expressed as odds ratio with 95% confidence intervals to identify predictors of hypertension. The risk score for hypertension was developed after shrinkage of variables and by using regression coefficients obtained by standard Logistic Regression Model. Results: Among 6,87,230 women between 15 and 49 years, 77,788 (11.3%) were hypertensive. The study results revealed that there was an increasing trend in the prevalence of hypertension (26.5%) with increasing age, and with increasing weight (23.4%). Urban areas (12.3% vs 10.9%), alcoholics (19.2%) and various forms of tobacco users (14.8%) had more prevalence of hypertension. Conclusion: Age, residing in urban area, consuming tobacco products, consumption of alcohol, non-vegetarian diet and overweight, were found to be the significant predictor variables, and were used to develop the Risk Prediction score using logistic regression model.
