30308998|t|Sleep and Delirium in Pediatric Critical Illness: What Is the Relationship?
30308998|a|With growing recognition of pediatric delirium in pediatric critical illness there has also been increased investigation into improving recognition and determining potential risk factors. Disturbed sleep has been assumed to be one of the key risk factors leading to delirium and is commonplace in the pediatric critical care setting as the nature of intensive care requires frequent and invasive monitoring and interventions. However, this relationship between sleep and delirium in pediatric critical illness has not been definitively established and may, instead, reflect significant overlap in risk factors and consequences of underlying neurologic dysfunction. We aim to review the existing tools for evaluation of sleep and delirium in the pediatric critical care setting and review findings from recent investigations with application of these measures in the pediatric intensive care unit.
