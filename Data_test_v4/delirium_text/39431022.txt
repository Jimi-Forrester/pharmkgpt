39431022|a|Rationale: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is hallmarked by amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques and hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau) neurofibrillary tangles. While Abeta-centric therapies have shown promise, the complex pathology of AD requires a multifaceted therapeutic approach. The weak association between Abeta levels and cognitive decline highlights the need for alternative theranostic strategies. Currently, oxidative stress and tau hyperphosphorylation are now recognized as critical pathological events in AD. Thus, therapies that concurrently attenuate oxidative stress damage and inhibit tau pathology hold great potential for AD treatment. Methods: Herein, a multifunctional neuron-targeted nanocomposite is devised to realize dual imaging-guided AD therapy, integrating the inhibition of tau pathology and reactive oxygen species (ROS)-neutralizing biofunctions. The construction of the nanocomposite incorporates polyphenolic antioxidants tannic acid (TA)-based nanoparticles carrying manganese ions (Mn2+) and fluorescent dye IR780 iodide (IR780), coupled with a neuron-specific TPL peptide. The resulting IR780-Mn@TA-TPL nanoparticles (NPs) are comprehensively evaluated in both in vitro and in vivo AD models to assess their imaging capabilities and therapeutic efficacy. Results: The nanocomposite facilitates Mn-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging. It effectively neutralizes toxic ROS and reduces tau hyperphosphorylation and aggregation. In AD rat models, the nanocomposite restores neuronal density in the hippocampus and significantly improves spatial memory. Conclusions: Such a neuron-targeting multifunctional nanocomposite represents a potential theranostic strategy for AD, signifying a shift towards bimodal imaging-guided treatment approaches.
