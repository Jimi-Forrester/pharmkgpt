11037189|a|Neuropathological evidence suggests that the two fibril lesions of neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) and senile plaques are the major findings in brain tissue of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and that their occurrence is strongly associated with the symptoms of dementia. Genetic findings have indicated that the pathological molecules from the lesions function as causal agents. There is little evidence, however, to directly indicate that fibril lesions themselves kill neuronal cells in vivo. In spite of such limitations it is important to consider the molecular events involved in AD etiology. In this review of the contribution of Japanese neuropathologists to studies of AD, I will introduce briefly their work and highlight some current topics for consideration on the etiology of AD, and the basis of cell death, and will offer my perspective on outstanding conflicting issues.
