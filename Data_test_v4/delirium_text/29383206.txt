29383206|t|Association between Female Urinary Incontinence and Geriatric Health Problems: Results from Korean Longitudinal Study of Ageing (2006).
29383206|a|BACKGROUND: Urinary incontinence (UI) is highly prevalent in the aging population. UI is one of the most common geriatric syndromes and affects overall health, quality of life, and economical burden in patients. The aims of this study were to investigate the characteristics of patients with UI and to assess its association with other geriatric health problems. METHODS: We used data from the Korean Longitudinal Study of Ageing obtained in 2006. Among the 10,254 individuals aged 45 years and older, we analyzed data from 2,418 women aged 65 years and older. Data were obtained using questionnaires for UI, comorbidities, and lifestyle factors. RESULTS: Among the 2,418 women aged 65 years and older, 506 (20.9%) had UI. Cerebrovascular disease (odds ratio [OR], 2.02; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.26 to 3.23), arthritis (OR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.18 to 1.77), and fear of falling (OR, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.18 to 2.22) were significantly associated with UI, while chronic lung disease, psychiatric disease, difficulty in daily living due to visual and hearing problems, and experiencing a fall in the last 2 years were not associated with UI. CONCLUSION: Cerebrovascular disease, arthritis, and especially fear of falls were significantly associated with UI in elderly Korean women.
