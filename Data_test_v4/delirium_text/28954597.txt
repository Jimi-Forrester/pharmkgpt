28954597|t|A Meta-Analysis on the Relationship of the PON Genes and Alzheimer Disease.
28954597|a|AIM: This study aimed to evaluate the association of the paraoxonase (PON) gene variants and Alzheimer disease (AD) using meta-analysis. METHODS: Relevant studies were identified by searching English and Chinese databases extensively. Allele and genotype frequencies for each included study were extracted. Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) was employed to assess the quality of included studies. The odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) was calculated using a random-effects or fixed-effects model. A Q statistic was used to evaluate homogeneity, and Egger test and funnel plot were used to assess publication bias. RESULTS: A total of 15 studies (involving 5 polymorphisms) were included and identified for the current meta-analysis. The NOS scores ranged from 7 to 8, meaning good quality of studies. It was found that the SS genotype of PON2 S311C polymorphism had an significant association with AD in the studied population (OR = 0.82, 95% CI: 0.68-0.99, P = .04), and the A allele of PON1 rs705379 polymorphism was positively related to AD in Caucasian population (OR = 1.21, 95% CI: 1.05-1.39, P = .009) as well as the GG genotype decreased AD risk significantly in Caucasians (OR = 0.7, 95% CI: 0.56-0.88, P = .002). However, there was no significant relationship between other 3 genetic variants of PON genes (L55 M, Q192 R, and -161C/T of PON1 gene) and AD. CONCLUSION: Existing evidence indicates that the S311C polymorphism (SS genotype) and the rs705379 (the A allele and GG genotype) are associated with risk of AD in studied population. Future studies with larger sample sizes will be necessary to confirm the present results.
