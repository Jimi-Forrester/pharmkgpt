36629085|t|Risk of Four Geriatric Syndromes: A Comparison of Mental Health Care and General Hospital Inpatients.
36629085|a|An observational, cross-sectional study is conducted to compare elevated risk scores of four geriatric syndromes (falls, malnutrition, physical impairment, delirium) in older hospitalized psychiatric patients (n=178) with patients hospitalized in a general hospital (n=687). The median age of all patients was 78 years (IQR 73.3-83.3), 53% were female. After correction for age and gender, we found significantly more often an elevated risk in the mental health care group, compared to the general hospital group of falls (Odds Ratio (OR) = 1.75; 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 1.18-2.57), malnutrition (OR = 4.12; 95% CI 2.67-6.36) and delirium (OR = 6.45; 95% CI 4.23-9.85). The risk on physical impairment was not statistically significantly different in both groups (OR = 1.36; 95% CI .90-2.07). Older mental health care patients have a higher risk to develop geriatric syndromes compared to general hospital patients with the same age and gender, which might be explained by a higher level of frailty.
