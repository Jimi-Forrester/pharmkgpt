38681197|a|The Nicotiana tabacum L. plant, a medicinal resource, holds significant potential for benefiting human health, as evidenced by its use in Native American and ancient Chinese cultures. Modern medical and pharmaceutical studies have investigated that the abundant and distinctive function metabolites in tobacco including nicotine, solanesol, cembranoid diterpenes, essential oil, seed oil and other tobacco extracts, avoiding the toxic components of smoke, mainly have the anti-oxidation, anti-lipid production, pro-lipid oxidation, pro-insulin sensitivity, anti-inflammation, anti-apoptosis and antimicrobial activities. They showed potential pharmaceutical value mainly as supplements or substitutes for treating neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, inflammatory diseases including colitis, arthritis, sepsis, multiple sclerosis, and myocarditis, and metabolic syndrome including Obesity and fatty liver. This review comprehensively presents the research status and the molecular mechanisms of tobacco and its metabolites basing on almost all the English and Chinese literature in recent 20 years in the field of medicine and pharmacology. This review serves as a foundation for future research on the medicinal potential of tobacco plants.
