38910647|t|The Role of Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio in Predicting Outcomes of Acute Organophosphorus Poisoning: A Comprehensive Review.
38910647|a|Organophosphorus poisoning (OPP) poses a significant threat to human health, necessitating accurate prognostic markers for timely intervention and improved outcomes. This review evaluates the potential of the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) as a prognostic indicator in acute organophosphorus poisoning (AOPP). A comprehensive analysis of existing literature reveals that elevated NLR values correlate with increased severity of poisoning and adverse clinical outcomes, including mortality and morbidity. NLR assessment offers valuable prognostic information beyond traditional markers, aiding risk stratification and guiding clinical decision-making. Integration of NLR into clinical practice holds promise for optimizing patient care through the early identification of high-risk individuals and tailored therapeutic interventions. Further research is needed to validate the utility of NLR in larger patient cohorts and standardize its incorporation into clinical guidelines. Leveraging NLR as a prognostic tool can enhance risk stratification, optimize treatment strategies, and ultimately improve outcomes in AOPP.
