39387624|a|BACKGROUND: Little is known about what components geriatricians routinely incorporate into outpatient comprehensive geriatric assessments (CGAs). AIMS: This study explored what components of CGAs are routinely incorporated into geriatricians' letters and assessed their consistency with the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) and a recently published survey of geriatricians. METHODS: We completed a manual content analysis, supplemented by qualitative thematic analysis, of 34 letters from five geriatricians, collected as part of the GOAL Trial. RESULTS: While more than 80% of letters included each of the key clinical domains described in the Medicare Benefits Schedule and survey of geriatricians, only 62% included advanced care planning and 47% mentioned immunisations. Forty-seven percent of letters included goal setting. Few letters showed evidence of multidisciplinary working. Issues identified by the geriatrician centred around the themes of advance care planning, symptom identification and management, medical comorbidities, strategies to support quality of life and interventions to manage frailty. Patient concerns identified in the letters were cognition and mood, declining function, future planning and symptom management. CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of geriatricians' letters provides important and novel insights into usual CGA practice. The letters provide evidence of multidimensional assessments of physical, functional, social and psychological health, and most include use of standardised tools. However, less than 50% include evidence of goal setting or multidisciplinary working. The results allow consideration of how CGAs might be carried out in the outpatient setting, so that interventions focused on improving the quality and efficacy of this intervention can be implemented.
