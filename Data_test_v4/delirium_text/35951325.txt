35951325|a|Importance: The association between social support and dementia risk has been debated. Most previous prospective studies have not differentiated the subtypes of social support. Objective: To examine whether the association between social support and risk of dementia differs by subtype of social support and by sex. Design, Setting, and Participants: This nationwide prospective cohort study included randomly sampled South Korean adults 60 years or older. The study was launched November 1, 2010, with follow-up every 2 years until November 30, 2020. The 5852 participants who completed the assessment for social support and were not diagnosed as having dementia, severe psychiatric disorders including major depressive disorder, or major neurological disorders at the baseline assessment were included in the analysis. Exposures: Geriatric psychiatrists administered the structured diagnostic interviews and physical examinations to every participant based on the Korean version of the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer Disease (CERAD-K) Assessment Packet Clinical Assessment Battery. Main Outcomes and Measures: Baseline levels of emotional and tangible support using the Medical Outcomes Survey Social Support Survey. Results: Among the 5852 participants (mean [SD] age, 69.8 [6.6] years; 3315 women [56.6%]; mean [SD] follow-up duration, 5.9 [2.4] years), 237 (4.0%) had incident all-cause dementia and 160 (2.7%) had incident Alzheimer disease (AD) subtype of dementia. Compared with women who reported having emotional support, those with low emotional support had almost a 2-fold higher incidence of all-cause dementia (18.4 [95% CI, 13.6-23.2] vs 10.7 [95% CI, 9.0-12.5] per 1000 person-years) and AD (14.4 [95% CI, 10.2-18.6] vs 7.8 [95% CI, 6.3-9.3] per 1000 person-years). Adjusted Cox proportional hazard analysis revealed that low emotional support was associated with increased risk of all-cause dementia (hazard ratio, 1.61 [95% CI, 1.10-2.36]; P = .02) and AD (hazard ratio, 1.66 [95% CI, 1.07-2.57]; P = .02) only in women. Low tangible support was not associated with a risk of all-cause dementia or AD regardless of sex. Conclusions and Relevance: The findings of this cohort study suggest that older women with low emotional support constitute a population at risk for dementia. The level of emotional support should be included in risk assessments of dementia.
