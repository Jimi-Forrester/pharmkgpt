38612542|t|Virus-Induced Epilepsy vs. Epilepsy Patients Acquiring Viral Infection: Unravelling the Complex Relationship for Precision Treatment.
38612542|a|The intricate relationship between viruses and epilepsy involves a bidirectional interaction. Certain viruses can induce epilepsy by infecting the brain, leading to inflammation, damage, or abnormal electrical activity. Conversely, epilepsy patients may be more susceptible to viral infections due to factors, such as compromised immune systems, anticonvulsant drugs, or surgical interventions. Neuroinflammation, a common factor in both scenarios, exhibits onset, duration, intensity, and consequence variations. It can modulate epileptogenesis, increase seizure susceptibility, and impact anticonvulsant drug pharmacokinetics, immune system function, and brain physiology. Viral infections significantly impact the clinical management of epilepsy patients, necessitating a multidisciplinary approach encompassing diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of both conditions. We delved into the dual dynamics of viruses inducing epilepsy and epilepsy patients acquiring viruses, examining the unique features of each case. For virus-induced epilepsy, we specify virus types, elucidate mechanisms of epilepsy induction, emphasize neuroinflammation's impact, and analyze its effects on anticonvulsant drug pharmacokinetics. Conversely, in epilepsy patients acquiring viruses, we detail the acquired virus, its interaction with existing epilepsy, neuroinflammation effects, and changes in anticonvulsant drug pharmacokinetics. Understanding this interplay advances precision therapies for epilepsy during viral infections, providing mechanistic insights, identifying biomarkers and therapeutic targets, and supporting optimized dosing regimens. However, further studies are crucial to validate tools, discover new biomarkers and therapeutic targets, and evaluate targeted therapy safety and efficacy in diverse epilepsy and viral infection scenarios.
