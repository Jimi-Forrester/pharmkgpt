35592703|a|Aim: Tracheostomy is widely performed in critically ill patients who require prolonged mechanical ventilation. Long-term morbidity (post-intensive care syndrome) in tracheostomized patients is not widely reported, however, so we evaluate it here. Methods: This is a sub-analysis of a single center prospective longitudinal study, which assessed activities of daily living (ADL) and psychiatric symptoms in adult patients emergently admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). We evaluated association between these symptoms and tracheostomy by posting questionnaires at 3 and 12 months after ICU discharge. Results: We analyzed 107 patients (15 patients with tracheostomy) at 3 months and 74 patients (13 patients with tracheostomy) at 12 months after ICU discharge. ADL tended to be lower in patients with tracheostomy than in those without tracheostomy at 3 months after ICU discharge (65 [10-100] versus 95 [59-100]; P = 0.28, 7/15 [47%] versus 30/102 [30%] Barthel Index scored <= 60; P = 0.23), however there were no significant differences. Psychiatric symptoms were not different between the groups at 3 months and again at 12 months. Conclusion: Activities of daily living disability and psychiatric symptoms were not significantly worse in patients with tracheostomy at 3 and 12 months from ICU discharge compared with patients without tracheostomy. Despite the limited number in our cohort, our study may inform shared decision making concerning tracheostomy for critically ill patients and their families.
