39302378|t|Preventing Donepezil-Induced Adverse Effects Through N-acetylcysteine Co-Administration.
39302378|a|Background: Drug-induced adverse symptoms affect patients' quality of life (QoL) during treatment. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of drug-induced adverse effects could help prevent them. As current drugs have limited effects in halting the progress of Alzheimer's disease (AD), patients are required to take these drugs over a long period. The main obstacles to long-term compliance are drug-elicited side effects that deteriorate patient QoL. Objective: Donepezil, the most popular acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (AChEI) drug for AD, induces various side effects, especially at high doses. This study aimed to identify a drug that can attenuate the side effects of donepezil and investigate the underlying mechanisms. Methods: Five-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats received daily oral donepezil and N-acetylcysteine (NAC) for four weeks. General symptoms following administration were monitored daily to address drug-related adverse effects. Cytosolic calcium influx and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) after drug treatment were measured in vitro using C2C12 myotubes. Results: High-dose donepezil induced numerous adverse symptoms in male and female rats, which were markedly attenuated by co-treatment with NAC. NAC significantly reduced both acute and chronic muscle-related symptoms caused by donepezil. Additionally, in vitro studies showed that high-dose donepezil increased ROS and intracellular calcium ([Ca2 +]i) levels in muscle cells, contributing to these adverse effects. NAC co-treatment dramatically reduced ROS and [Ca2 +]i levels in muscle cells. Conclusions: Combined treatment with NAC effectively diminishes the adverse effects elicited by donepezil by regulating ROS and [Ca2 +]i levels in the skeletal muscle, which could contribute to improving donepezil treatment in patients.
