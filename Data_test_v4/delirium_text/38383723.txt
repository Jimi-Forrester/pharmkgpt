38383723|a|Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is the initial phase of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The cognitive decline is linked to abnormal connectivity between different regions of the brain. Most brain network studies fail to consider the changes in brain patterns and do not reflect the dynamic pathological characteristics of patients. Therefore, this paper proposes a method for constructing brain networks based on microstate sequences. It also analyzes the microstate temporal parameters and introduces a new feature, the brain homeostasis coefficient (Bhc), to quantify the stability of patient brain connections. The results showed that microstate class B parameters were higher in the MCI than in the HC group. Additionally, the Bhc values in most channels of the MCI and AD groups were lower than those of the HC group, with the most significant differences observed in the right frontal lobe. These differences were statistically significant (P < 0.05). The findings indicate that connectivity in the right frontal lobe may be most severely disrupted in patients with cognitive impairment. Furthermore, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment score showed a strong positive correlation with Bhc. This suggests that Bhc could be a novel biomarker for evaluating cognitive function in patients with cognitive impairment.
