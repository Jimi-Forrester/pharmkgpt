38221979|a|Chronic oxidative stress plays a critical role in the development of brain malignancies due to the high rate of brain oxygen utilization and concomitant production of reactive oxygen species. The nuclear factor-erythroid-2-related factor 2 (NRF2), a master regulator of antioxidant signaling, is a key factor in regulating brain physiology and the development of age-related neurodegenerative diseases. Also, NRF2 is known to exert a protective antioxidant effect against the onset of oxidative stress-induced diseases, including cancer, along with its pro-oncogenic activities through regulating various signaling pathways and downstream target genes. In glioblastoma (GB), grade 4 glioma, tumor resistance, and recurrence are caused by the glioblastoma stem cell population constituting a small bulk of the tumor core. The persistence and self-renewal capacity of these cell populations is enhanced by NRF2 expression in GB tissues. This review outlines NRF2's dual involvement in cancer and highlights its regulatory role in human brain physiology and diseases, in addition to the development of primary brain tumors and therapeutic potential, with a focus on GB.
