33667847|t|Design, synthesis and evaluation of novel dimethylamino chalcone-O-alkylamines derivatives as potential multifunctional agents against Alzheimer's disease.
33667847|a|A novel series of dimethylamino chalcone-O-alkylamines derivatives was designed and synthesized as multifunctional agents for the treatment of AD. All the target compounds exhibited significant abilities to inhibit and disaggregate Abeta aggregation, and acted as potential selective AChE inhibitors, biometal chelators and selective MAO-B inhibitors. Among these compounds, compound TM-6 showed the greatest inhibitory activity against self-induced Abeta aggregation (IC50 = 0.88 muM) and well disaggregation ability toward self-induced Abeta aggregation (95.1%, 25 muM), the TEM images, molecular docking study and molecular dynamics simulations provided reasonable explanation for its high efficiency, and it was also found to be a remarkable antioxidant (ORAC-FL values of 2.1eq.), the best AChE inhibitor (IC50 = 0.13 muM) and MAO-B inhibitor (IC50 = 1.0 muM), as well as a good neuroprotectant. UV-visual spectrometry and ThT fluorescence assay revealed that compound TM-6 was not only a good biometal chelator by inhibiting Cu2+-induced Abeta aggregation (95.3%, 25 muM) but also could disassemble the well-structured Abeta fibrils (88.1%, 25 muM). Further, TM-6 could cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in vitro. More importantly, compound TM-6 did not show any acute toxicity in mice at doses of up to 1000 mg/kg and improved scopolamine-induced memory impairment. Taken together, these data indicated that TM-6, an excellent balanced multifunctional inhibitor, was a potential lead compound for the treatment of AD.
