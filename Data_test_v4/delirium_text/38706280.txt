38706280|t|Who Benefited Most from the Internet-Based Conversational Engagement RCT (I-CONECT)? Application of the Personalized Medicine Approach to a Behavioral Intervention Study.
38706280|a|BACKGROUND: Many Alzheimer's Disease (AD) clinical trials have failed to demonstrate treatment efficacy on cognition. It is conceivable that a complex disease like AD may not have the same treatment effect due to many heterogeneities of disease processes and individual traits. OBJECTIVES: We employed an individual-level treatment response (ITR) approach to determine the characteristics of treatment responders and estimated time saved in cognitive decline using the Internet-based Conversational Engagement Clinical Trial (I-CONECT) behavioral intervention study as a model. DESIGN AND SETTING: I-CONECT is a multi-site, single-blind, randomized controlled trial aimed to improve cognitive functions through frequent conversational interactions via internet/webcam. The experimental group engaged in video chats with study staff 4 times/week for 6 months; the control group received weekly 10-minute check-in phone calls. PARTICIPANTS: Out of 186 randomized participants, current study used 139 participants with complete information on both baseline and 6-month follow-up (73 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 66 with normal cognition; 64 in the experimental group, and 75 in the control group). MEASUREMENTS: ITR scores were generated for the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) (global cognition, primary outcome) and Category Fluency Animals (CFA) (semantic fluency, secondary outcome) that showed significant efficacy in the trial. ITR scores were generated through 300 iterations of 3-fold cross-validated random forest models. The average treatment difference (ATD) curve and the area between the curves (ABC) were estimated to measure the heterogeneity of treatment responses. Responder traits were identified using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and decision tree models. The time saved in cognitive decline was explored to gauge clinical meaningfulness. RESULTS: ABC statistics showed substantial heterogeneity in treatment response with MoCA but modest heterogeneity in treatment response with CFA. Age, cognitive status, time spent with family and friends, education, and personality were important characteristics that influenced treatment responses. Intervention group participants in the upper 30% of ITR scores demonstrated potential delays of 3 months in semantic fluency (CFA) and 6 months in global cognition (MoCA), assuming a 5-fold faster natural cognitive decline compared to the control group during the post-treatment period. CONCLUSIONS: ITR-based analyses are valuable in profiling treatment responders for features that can inform future trial design and clinical practice. Reliably measuring time saved in cognitive decline is an area of ongoing research to gain insight into the clinical meaningfulness of treatment.
