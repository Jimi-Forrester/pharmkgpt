38263973|a|Intensive care unit-acquired weakness (ICU-AW) is a common complication in critically ill patients and is associated with a variety of adverse outcomes. These include the need for prolonged mechanical ventilation and ICU stay; higher ICU, in-hospital, and 1-year mortality; and increased in-hospital costs. ICU-AW is associated with multiple risk factors including age, underlying disease, severity of illness, organ failure, sepsis, immobilization, receipt of mechanical ventilation, and other factors related to critical care. The pathological mechanism of ICU-AW remains unclear and may be considerably varied. This review aimed to evaluate recent insights into ICU-AW from several aspects including risk factors, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment strategies; this provides new perspectives for future research.
