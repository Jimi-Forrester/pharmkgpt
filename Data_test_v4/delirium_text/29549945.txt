29549945|a|For successful theranosis of brain diseases, limited access of therapeutic molecules across blood-brain barrier (BBB) needs be overcome in brain delivery. Currently, peptide derivatives of rabies virus glycoprotein (RVG) have been exploited as delivery ligands to transport nanocarriers across BBB and specifically into the brain. The targeting peptides usually conjugate to the nanocarrier surface, and the cargoes, including siRNA, miRNA, DNA, proteins and small molecular chemicals, are complexed or encapsulated in the nanocarriers. The peptide ligand of the RVG-modified nanocarriers introduces the conjugated targeted-delivery into the brain, and the cargoes are involved in disease theranosis. The peptide-modified nanocarriers have been applied to diagnose and treat various brain diseases, such as glioma, Alzheimer's disease, ischemic injury, protein misfolding diseases etc. Since the targeting delivery system has displayed good biocompatibility and desirable therapeutic effect, it will raise a potential application in treating brain diseases.
