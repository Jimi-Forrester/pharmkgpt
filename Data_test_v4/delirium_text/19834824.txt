19834824|a|We previously reported that coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) could reduce intracellular deposition in an aged transgenic mouse model. Here, we further tested the effect of CoQ10 on amyloid plaque in an amyloid precursor protein/presenilin 1 transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD). By using immunohistochemistry and magnetic resonance imaging to determine the burden of amyloid plaque, we found that oral administration of CoQ10 can efficiently reduce the burden of the plaques in this mouse model. These data demonstrate that in addition to reducing intracellular deposition of Abeta, CoQ10 can also reduce plaque pathology. Our study further supports the use of CoQ10 as a therapeutic candidate for AD.
