35909|t|[Selection of therapeutic tactics in alcoholic delirium].
35909|a|The author analyzed the effectivity of the treatment in 602 patients with delirium tremens observed for three years. The first group, 395 patients, received along with the desintoxicational therapy-neuroleptics (aminazin, tizercin, haloperidol). In the second group (207 patients) the treatment was carried out without neuroleptics, the patients received massive desintoxication in the form of drop infusions of solutions with the inclusion of tranquilizers as well (seduxen). The indices of lethality and the average duration of the stay in hospitals were used as criteria of the treatment efficiency. In the second group these indices were much lower: lethality -- 4,4 times less, the duration of the treatment twice less. The data obtained testify against the use of neuroleptics in the treatment of delirium tremens.
