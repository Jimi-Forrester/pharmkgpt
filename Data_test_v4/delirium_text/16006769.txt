16006769|t|Pathological opening of the blood-brain barrier to horseradish peroxidase and amyloid precursor protein following ischemia-reperfusion brain injury.
16006769|a|This study was performed to test the hypothesis that fragments of amyloid precursor protein are able to enter the injured blood-brain barrier (BBB) following brain ischemia. We observed chronic disruption of the BBB after ischemia. The BBB changes did not increase in intensity and frequency with longer periods of recirculation. As an effect of BBB injury, we noted a visible connection of diffuse amyloid plaques with neurovasculature in rats. This pathology appears to have a similar distribution as in Alzheimer's disease, hippocampal and cortical changes being most severe.
