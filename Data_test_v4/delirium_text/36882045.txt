36882045|t|In vivo [18F]THK-5351 imaging detected reactive astrogliosis in argyrophilic grain disease with comorbid pathology: A clinicopathological study.
36882045|a|Quantification of in vivo reactive astrogliosis, which represents neural inflammation and remodeling in the brain, is an emerging methodology for the evaluation of patients with neurodegenerative diseases. [18F]THK-5351 is a positron emission tomography (PET) tracer for monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B), a molecular marker of reactive astrogliosis. We performed in vivo [18F]THK-5351 PET in a patient who at autopsy was found to have argyrophilic grain disease (AGD) with comorbid pathology to visualize reactive astrogliosis for the first time. We aimed to validate an imaging-pathology correlation using [18F]THK-5351 PET and the autopsy brain. The patient, a 78-year-old man, was pathologically diagnosed with AGD combined with limbic-predominant age-related transactive response DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa encephalopathy and Lewy body disease without Alzheimer disease-related neuropathological changes. Reactive astrogliosis in the postmortem brain was abundant in the inferior temporal gyrus, insular gyrus, entorhinal cortex, and ambient gyrus where premortem [18F]THK-5351 signals were high. We found a proportional correlation between the amount of reactive astrogliosis in the postmortem brain and the in vivo [18F]THK-5351 standardized uptake value ratio (r = 0.8535, p = 0.0004). These results indicated that reactive astrogliosis in AGD with comorbid pathology could be identified and quantified by in vivo MAO-B imaging.
