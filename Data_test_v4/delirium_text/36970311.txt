36970311|t|Melatonin's actions are not limited to sleep.
36970311|a|Melatonin is widely available as a supplement, usually for sleep disorders. The consumption of melatonin supplements has increased considerably in recent years. An overlooked aspect of melatonin's administration is the resulting increase in prolactin secretion, via its action on hypothalamic dopaminergic neurons. We believe that since the effect of melatonin on prolactin is tangible, the laboratory finding of hyperprolactinemia could be encountered more often, given the increase in melatonin's use. This is an issue that merits further study.
