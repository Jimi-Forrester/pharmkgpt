1707735|a|Tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) is the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of serotonin and a specific marker for serotonergic neurons. These neurons are affected in Alzheimer's disease (AD) in several ways: serotonin is decreased in axon terminals, serotonin neurons accumulate neurofibrillary protein, and these neurons are lost in AD brains. One subcellular mechanism which may underlie degeneration of neurons in AD is decreased axonal transport with accumulation of enzymes and their potentially toxic metabolites in the cell body. To determine whether there is a defect in axonal transport in serotonin neurons in AD we measured TPH activity, serotonin and its oxidative metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) in dorsal raphe cell bodies from Alzheimer and control cases. TPH activity is increased 4.7-fold in raphe neuron cell bodies in Alzheimer brains. Serotonin and 5-HIAA are increased by 4.0- and 2.0-fold, respectively in Alzheimer compared to control raphe cell bodies. In contrast, in synaptic terminals of the amygdala 5-HT and 5-HIAA were decreased by 41% and 50%, respectively in the same AD cases. We propose that the accumulation of TPH and its products in the raphe perikarya in AD results from a diminished transport of TPH to axon terminals. The accumulation of oxidative metabolites of serotonin may contribute to the degeneration of serotonergic neurons in AD.
