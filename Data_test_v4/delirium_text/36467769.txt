36467769|a|BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Platycodon grandiflorum (PG) has long been known as a medicinal herb effective in various diseases, including bronchitis and asthma, but is still more widely used for food. Fermentation methods are being applied to increase the pharmacological composition of PG extracts and commercialize them with high added value. This study examines the hydrolyzed and fermented PG extract (HFPGE) fermented with Lactobacillus casei in RAW 264.7 cells, and investigates the effect of amplifying the immune and the probable molecular mechanism. MATERIALS/METHODS: HFPGE's total phenolic, flavonoid, saponin, and platycodin D contents were analyzed by colorimetric analysis or high-performance liquid chromatography. Cell viability was measured by the MTT assay. Phagocytic activity was analyzed by a phagocytosis assay kit, nitric oxide (NO) production by a Griess reagent system, and cytokines by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. The mRNA expressions of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cytokines were analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, whereas MAPK and nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB activation were analyzed by Western blots. RESULTS: Compared to PGE, HFPGE was determined to contain 13.76 times and 6.69 times higher contents of crude saponin and platycodin D, respectively. HFPGE promoted cell proliferation and phagocytosis in RAW 264.7 cells and regulated the NO production and iNOS expression. Treatment with HFPGE also resulted in increased production of interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, C-X-C motif chemokine ligand10, granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and the mRNA expressions of these cytokines. HFPGE also resulted in significantly increasing the phosphorylation of NF-kappaB p65, extracellular signal-regulated kinase, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our results imply that fermentation and hydrolysis result in the extraction of more active ingredients of PG. Furthermore, we determined that HFPGE exerts immunostimulatory activity via the MAPK and NF-kappaB signaling pathways.
