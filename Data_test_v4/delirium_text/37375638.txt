37375638|a|Vitamin B12 plays a key role in DNA stability. Research indicates that vitamin B12 deficiency leads to indirect DNA damage, and vitamin B12 supplementation may reverse this effect. Vitamin B12 acts as a cofactor for enzymes such as methionine synthase and methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, which are involved in DNA methylation and nucleotide synthesis. These processes are essential for DNA replication and transcription, and any impairment can result in genetic instability. In addition, vitamin B12 has antioxidant properties that help protect DNA from damage caused by reactive oxygen species. This protection is achieved by scavenging free radicals and reducing oxidative stress. In addition to their protective functions, cobalamins can also generate DNA-damaging radicals in vitro that can be useful in scientific research. Research is also being conducted on the use of vitamin B12 in medicine as vectors for xenobiotics. In summary, vitamin B12 is an essential micronutrient that plays a vital role in DNA stability. It acts as a cofactor for enzymes involved in the synthesis of nucleotides, has antioxidant properties and has potential value as a generator of DNA-damaging radicals and drug transporters.
