30830576|t|A Close Look at BACE1 Inhibitors for Alzheimer's Disease Treatment.
30830576|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common cause of age-dependent dementia, is one of the most significant healthcare problems worldwide. Aggravating this situation, drugs that are currently US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for AD treatment do not prevent or delay disease progression. Therefore, developing effective therapies for AD patients is of critical urgency. Human genetic and clinical studies over the past three decades have indicated that abnormal generation or accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides is a likely culprit in AD pathogenesis. Abeta is generated from amyloid precursor protein (APP) via proteolytic cleavage by beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) (memapsin 2, beta-secretase, Asp 2 protease) and gamma-secretase. Mice deficient in BACE1 show abrogated production of Abeta. Therefore, pharmacological inhibition of BACE1 is being intensively pursued as a therapeutic approach to treat AD patients. Recent setbacks in clinical trials with BACE1 inhibitors have highlighted the critical importance of understanding how to properly inhibit BACE1 to treat AD patients. This review summarizes the recent studies on the role of BACE1 in synaptic functions as well as our views on BACE1 inhibition as an effective AD treatment.
