22665730|t|[Comparative evaluation of clinical efficacy of drugs remaxol and ademetionine in patients with acute ethanol poisoning complicated by the toxic damage of the liver].
22665730|a|As a result of survey in process of treatment of 100 patients with severe acute poisoning of ethanol on the background of the toxic damage of the liver set that the severity of poisoning depends on the duration abuse of alcohol (Binge drinking). Inclusion in the intensive care infusion hepatoprotector remaxol compared with ademetionine leads to a faster dynamics of improvement of the patients condition, evaluated by the scale assessing the severity APACHE II. Also found, Use of remaxol can reduce development of complications such is alcoholic delirium on the background of long-term abuse of alcohol in percentage from 31.9% to 16%, as well as reduces the time of stay of patients in the departments of the resuscitation and intensive care unit from 7,3+-0,6 to 5,6+-0,3 days and duration of treatment of patients in the hospital from 11,8+-1,1 to 9,0+-0,4 days.
