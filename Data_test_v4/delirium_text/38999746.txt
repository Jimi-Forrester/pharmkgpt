38999746|t|The Study of Myo-Inositol's Anxiolytic Activity on Zebrafish (Danio rerio).
38999746|a|INTRODUCTION: Myo-inositol (MI) is the most abundant inositol found in nature. To date MI supplementation is reported to be effective in the treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome, it is also suggested to alleviate the symptoms of diabetes and neurodegenerative disorders, but to date no statistically significant effects of inositol on depressive and anxiety symptoms were proven. In the study of anxiolytic effects in zebrafish, we often use the thigmotaxis index measuring the ratio of the amount of time the animal spends near the walls compared to the entire arena. AIM: The objective of this paper was to examine the effect of MI on zebrafish embryos' locomotor activity, as well as its potential anxiolytic activity in zebrafish larvae. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In the first part of the experiment, the embryos were incubated with 5, 10, 20, and 40 mg/mL MI. 1-day post fertilization, embryo mobility was evaluated and burst activity was calculated. In the next part of the study, the behavior of 5-day-old larvae was tested. RESULTS: Tests on embryo movement showed an increase in burst activity in the MI group at concentrations of 40 mg/mL (p < 0.0001) and a slight decrease in the group at concentrations of 10 mg/mL (p < 0.05). MI in the light/dark challenge had no impact on the thigmotaxis index. CONCLUSIONS: MI was shown to not affect stress reduction in zebrafish larvae. Further research on the potential of MI and other stereoisomers is needed.
