In the present study, we examined the genomic distribution of 5hmC, an indicator of DNA methylation, in the brain regions of non-human primates (rhesus monkey) at the ages of 2 (juvenile), 8 (young adult), and 17 (old) years. We found that genomic 5hmC distribution was accumulated in the monkey brain as age increased and displayed unique patterns in the cerebellum and striatum in an age-dependent manner. We also observed a correlation between differentially hydroxymethylated regions (DhMRs) and genes that contribute to brain region-related functions and diseases. Our studies revealed, for the first time, the brain-region and age-dependent 5hmC modifications in the non-human primate and the association of these 5hmC modifications with brain region-specific function and potentially aging-related brain diseases.
