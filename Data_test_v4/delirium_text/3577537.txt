3577537|t|[Endogenous blood ethanol in alcoholic patients and healthy subjects with and without a family history of alcoholism].
3577537|a|Levels of endogenous ethanol were studied in healthy males, 12-13-year-old boys (sons of alcoholics and normal fathers) and alcoholic patients (after discontinuation of all drugs). The results showed no significant differences between the groups. On the other hand endogenous ethanol concentrations were higher than normal in oligophrenic boys irrespective of whether their fathers were alcoholics or healthy subjects. In the abstinence period endogenic ethanol concentrations were the minimal in patients with delirium tremens and a severe abstinence syndrome, the dynamics of this parameter in the process of treatment being dependent on the severity of the abstinence syndrome and on the nature of treatment.
