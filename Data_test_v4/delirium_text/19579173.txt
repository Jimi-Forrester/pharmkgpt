19579173|a|This review discusses current knowledge of the complex interactions between amyloid-beta (A beta) peptide, the receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE), and inflammatory mediators, focusing on the roles of such interactions in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. As a ubiquitous cell-surface receptor, RAGE demonstrates enhanced expression in an A beta-rich environment; the effects of RAGE on microglia, the blood-brain barrier and neurons are mediated through various signaling pathways. Relevant preclinical models illustrate that the A beta-RAGE interaction amplifies neuronal stress and the accumulation of A beta, impairs memory and learning, and exaggerates neuroinflammation. These findings suggest that RAGE may mediate a common proinflammatory pathway in neurodegenerative disorders.
