38097566|t|Pre-clinical indications of brain stimulation treatments for non-affective psychiatric disorders, a status update.
38097566|a|Over the past two decades noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques have emerged as powerful therapeutic options for a range of psychiatric and neurological disorders. NIBS are hypothesized to rebalance pathological brain networks thus reducing symptoms and improving functioning. This development has been fueled by controlled studies with increasing size and rigor aiming to characterize how treatments induce clinically effective change. Clinical trials of NIBS for specific indications have resulted in federal approval for unipolar depression, bipolar depression, smoking cessation, and obsessive-compulsive disorder in the United States, and several other indications worldwide. As a rapidly emerging field, there are numerous pre-clinical indications currently in development using a variety of electrical and magnetic, non-convulsive, and convulsive approaches. This review discusses the state-of-the-science surrounding promising avenues of NIBS currently in pre-approval stages for non-affective psychiatric disorders. We consider emerging therapies for psychosis, anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and borderline personality disorder, utilizing transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), and magnetic seizure therapy (MST), with an additional brief section for early-stage techniques including transcranial focused ultrasound stimulation (tFUS) and transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS). As revealed in this review, there is considerable promise across all four psychiatric indications with different NIBS approaches. Positive findings are notable for the treatment of psychosis using tDCS, MST, and rTMS. While rTMS is already FDA approved for the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder, methodologies such as tDCS also demonstrate potential in this condition. Emerging techniques show promise for treating non-affective disorders likely leading to future regulatory approvals.
