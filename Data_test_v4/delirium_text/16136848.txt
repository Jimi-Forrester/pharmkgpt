16136848|t|One-trial 10-item free-recall performance in Taiwanese elderly and near-elderly: A potential screen for cognitive decline.
16136848|a|To explore a one-trial 10-item free-recall test as a potential dementia screening tool, we analyzed recall scores and individualized serial position effects in near-elderly (N = 2,336) and elderly (N = 2,371) participants in a population-based survey in Taiwan. Age and sex were significantly associated with recall score [younger > older (p < 0.001); men > women (p < 0.001)]; after controlling for gender and age group, weak association between recall and education was still observed. By contrast, serial position effects (SPEs), defined for each participant and analyzed aggregated over each age group, were not associated with education and tended not to be associated with sex. Primacy effects were observed in 67 to 80 percent, and recency effects were observed in 41 to 54 percent of respondents. Because SPEs were defined for each respondent, we could determine that loss of the primacy effect was associated with significantly larger losses in total recall score in elderly persons who had exhibited both SPEs at the first survey, as compared to those who maintained both SPEs at successive surveys (p < 0.01). Elderly subjects showed slight longitudinal decline in free recall. A one-trial 10-item free-recall test demonstrated age-related cognitive decline in this Taiwanese population survey cohort; SPEs at the individual level may be useful markers for important cognitive change and warrant further study and benchmarking against valid and reliable tests of memory and cognitive decline.
