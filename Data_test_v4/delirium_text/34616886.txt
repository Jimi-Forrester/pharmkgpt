34616886|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: This paper presents an in-depth review of the state-of-the-art genetic variations analysis to discover complex genes associated with the brain's genetic disorders. We first introduce the genetic analysis of complex brain diseases, genetic variation, and DNA microarrays. Then, the review focuses on available machine learning methods used for complex brain disease classification. Therein, we discuss the various datasets, preprocessing, feature selection and extraction, and classification strategies. In particular, we concentrate on studying single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) that support the highest resolution for genomic fingerprinting for tracking disease genes. Subsequently, the study provides an overview of the applications for some specific diseases, including autism spectrum disorder, brain cancer, and Alzheimer's disease (AD). The study argues that despite the significant recent developments in the analysis and treatment of genetic disorders, there are considerable challenges to elucidate causative mutations, especially from the viewpoint of implementing genetic analysis in clinical practice. The review finally provides a critical discussion on the applicability of genetic variations analysis for complex brain disease identification highlighting the future challenges. METHODS: We used a methodology for literature surveys to obtain data from academic databases. Criteria were defined for inclusion and exclusion. The selection of articles was followed by three stages. In addition, the principal methods for machine learning to classify the disease were presented in each stage in more detail. RESULTS: It was revealed that machine learning based on SNP was widely utilized to solve problems of genetic variation for complex diseases related to genes. CONCLUSIONS: Despite significant developments in genetic diseases in the past two decades of the diagnosis and treatment, there is still a large percentage in which the causative mutation cannot be determined, and a final genetic diagnosis remains elusive. So, we need to detect the variations of the genes related to brain disorders in the early disease stages.
