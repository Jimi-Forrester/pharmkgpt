32854348|t|Role of Phosphodiesterase 7 (PDE7) in T Cell Activity. Effects of Selective PDE7 Inhibitors and Dual PDE4/7 Inhibitors on T Cell Functions.
32854348|a|Phosphodiesterase 7 (PDE7), a cAMP-specific PDE family, insensitive to rolipram, is present in many immune cells, including T lymphocytes. Two genes of PDE7 have been identified: PDE7A and PDE7B with three or four splice variants, respectively. Both PDE7A and PDE7B are expressed in T cells, and the predominant splice variant in these cells is PDE7A1. PDE7 is one of several PDE families that terminates biological functions of cAMP-a major regulating intracellular factor. However, the precise role of PDE7 in T cell activation and function is still ambiguous. Some authors reported its crucial role in T cell activation, while according to other studies PDE7 activity was not pivotal to T cells. Several studies showed that inhibition of PDE7 by its selective or dual PDE4/7 inhibitors suppresses T cell activity, and consequently T-mediated immune response. Taken together, it seems quite likely that simultaneous inhibition of PDE4 and PDE7 by dual PDE4/7 inhibitors or a combination of selective PDE4 and PDE7 remains the most interesting therapeutic target for the treatment of some immune-related disorders, such as autoimmune diseases, or selected respiratory diseases. An interesting direction of future studies could also be using a combination of selective PDE7 and PDE3 inhibitors.
