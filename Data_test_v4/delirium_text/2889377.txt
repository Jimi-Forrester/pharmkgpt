2889377|t|CSF somatostatin in patients with Alzheimer's disease, older depressed patients, and age-matched control subjects.
2889377|a|Somatostatin-like immunoreactivity was measured in the CSF of 12 patients with Alzheimer's disease, 15 age-matched control subjects, and 20 older depressed subjects. Patients with dementia or depression were found to have lower CSF somatostatin concentrations than control subjects despite markedly different clinical presentations. Severity of depression was clearly different in all three groups but showed no significant correlation with CSF concentration of somatostatin. There was a significant positive correlation between CSF somatostatin-like immunoreactivity and cognitive functioning in all 47 subjects, but this association was not statistically significant within individual diagnostic groups. These data raise interesting questions about possible biological links between Alzheimer's disease and depression in older patients.
