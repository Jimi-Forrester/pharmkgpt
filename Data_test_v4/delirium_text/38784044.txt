38784044|t|Quantitative Assessment of Intracellular Effectors and Cellular Response in RAGE Activation.
38784044|a|The review delves into the methods for the quantitative assessment of intracellular effectors and cellular response of Receptor for Advanced Glycation End products (RAGE), a vital transmembrane receptor involved in a range of physiological and pathological processes. RAGE bind to Advanced Glycation End products (AGEs) and other ligands, which in turn activate diverse downstream signaling pathways that impact cellular responses such as inflammation, oxidative stress, and immune reactions. The review article discusses the intracellular signaling pathways activated by RAGE followed by differential activation of RAGE signaling across various diseases. This will ultimately guide researchers in developing targeted and effective interventions for diseases associated with RAGE activation. Further, we have discussed how PCR, western blotting, and microscopic examination of various molecules involved in downstream signaling can be leveraged to monitor, diagnose, and explore diseases involving proteins with unique post-translational modifications. This review article underscores the pressing need for advancements in molecular approaches for disease detection and management involving RAGE.
