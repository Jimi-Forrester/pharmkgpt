25514407|a|The reaction of 5-(1-adamantyl)-4-ethyl or allyl-1,2,4-triazoline-3-thione with formaldehyde solution and various 1-substituted piperazines yielded the corresponding N-Mannich bases. The newly synthesized N-Mannich bases were tested for in vitro inhibitory activities against a panel of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and the yeast-like pathogenic fungus Candida albicans. Six compounds showed potent antibacterial activity against one or more of the tested microorganisms, while two compounds exhibited moderate activity against the tested Gram-positive bacteria. None of the newly synthesized compounds were proved to possess marked activity against Candida albicans. The oral hypoglycemic activity of six compounds was determined in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. Four compounds produced significant strong dose-dependent reduction of serum glucose levels, compared to gliclazide at 10 mg/kg dose level (potency ratio > 75%).
