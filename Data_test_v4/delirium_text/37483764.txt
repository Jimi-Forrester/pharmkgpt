37483764|t|Clinical characteristics and reaction to dopaminergic treatment of drug-naive patients with Parkinson's disease in central China: A cross sectional study.
37483764|a|Background: The symptoms of early Parkinson's disease (PD) are complex and hidden. The aim of this study is to explore and summarize the characteristics of the symptoms of drug naive patients with PD. Objectives: and Methods Drug-naive patients with PD and age-matched healthy controls were recruited from the outpatient clinic of Wuhan Union Hospital. The motor and non-motor symptoms were evaluated for further analysis using Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) I, II, and III; Sniffin' Sticks Screening 12 test; Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE); Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA); Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA); and Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD) scores. The acute levodopa challenge test (ALCT) was adopted to assess the reaction to dopaminergic treatment. Results: We recruited 80 drug-naive patients with PD and 40 age-matched healthy controls (HCs). Approximately 53.7% of the patients were females. The mean onset age was 59.96 +- 10.40 years. The mean UPDRS I, II, and III were 2.01 +- 1.90, 6.18 +- 3.68, and 26.13 +- 12.09, respectively. Compared with HCs, PD patients had lower scores in MMSE and MoCA; and higher scores in HAMA and HAMD (p < 0.05). In ALCT, 54 patients showed good responses to levodopa while 26 patients did not. The mean improvement rate of UPDRS III was 34.09% at 120 min. Conclusion: The motor symptoms of patients with early PD were mild but virous. They also suffered from different non-motor symptoms. In ALCT, about two thirds of patients (54/80) with early PD showed good response to levodopa. Among four aspects of motor symptoms, bradykinesia reacted best to ALCT, while axial symptoms were the worst.
