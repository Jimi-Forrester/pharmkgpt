29984362|a|We report a case of a 35 year old woman with colon cancer metastatic to liver and lung who presented for exploratory laparotomy and/placement of hepatic arterial infusion pump for chemotherapy. Surgical course was notable for aberrant hepatic artery anatomy requiring extended dissection time, vascular surgery consultation, and use of substantial methylene blue to aid in visualization. Of note, patient's history was also significant for anxiety and depression, for which she was being treated with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) duloxetine (Cymbalta). The patient subsequently developed serotonin syndrome in the postoperative period but fully recovered. Our case highlights the need for close attention to methylene dosing recommendations and improved communication between perioperative care providers (surgery, anesthesia, nursing, and pharmacy) to prevent such occurrences.
