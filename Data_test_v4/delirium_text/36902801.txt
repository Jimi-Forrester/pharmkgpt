36902801|t|Identification of a Novel Cuproptosis-Related Gene Signature and Integrative Analyses in Thyroid Cancer.
36902801|a|Cuproptosis is a novel programmed cell death that depends on copper. The role and potential mechanism of cuproptosis-related genes (CRGs) in thyroid cancer (THCA) are still unclear. In our study, we randomly divided THCA patients from the TCGA database into a training set and a testing set. A cuproptosis-related signature consisting of six genes (SLC31A1, LIAS, DLD, MTF1, CDKN2A, and GCSH) was constructed using the training set to predict the prognosis of THCA and was verified with the testing set. All patients were classified into low- and high-risk groups according to risk score. Patients in the high-risk group had a poorer overall survival (OS) than those in the low-risk group. The area under the curve (AUC) values for 5 years, 8 years, and 10 years were 0.845, 0.885, and 0.898, respectively. The tumor immune cell infiltration and immune status were significantly higher in the low-risk group, which indicated a better response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). The expression of six cuproptosis-related genes in our prognostic signature were verified by qRT-PCR in our THCA tissues, and the results were consistent with TCGA database. In summary, our cuproptosis-related risk signature has a good predictive ability regarding the prognosis of THCA patients. Targeting cuproptosis may be a better alternative for THCA patients.
