38417951|a|INTRODUCTION: Postoperative sleep disturbances significantly impair postoperative recovery. The administration of intravenous esketamine has been shown to potentially improve postoperative sleep quality. However, the effectiveness of epidural esketamine in improving postoperative sleep quality remains to be elucidated. This study aims to explore the impact of both intraoperative and postoperative use of epidural esketamine on the postoperative sleep quality of patients undergoing minimally invasive lower abdominal surgeries. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial will be conducted at the Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Centre. A total of 128 adults undergoing minimally invasive lower abdominal surgeries will be randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to either the esketamine group or the placebo group. In the esketamine group, epidural esketamine will be administered intraoperatively (0.2 mg/kg) and postoperatively (25 mg). Postoperatively, all patients will receive epidural analgesia. The primary outcome of the study is the incidence of poor sleep quality on the third day after surgery. The sleep quality assessment will be conducted using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and a Numeric Rating Scale of sleep. The main secondary outcomes include postoperative pain and anxiety and depression scores. The postoperative pain, both rest pain and movement pain, will be assessed using a Numerical Rating Scale within 5 days after surgery. Anxiety and depression scores will be evaluated using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale both before and after the surgery. Safety outcomes will include delirium, fidgeting, hallucinations, dizziness and nightmares. The analyses will be performed in accordance with intention-to-treat principle ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval has been obtained from the Ethics Committee of the Shanghai Cancer Centre (2309281-9). Prior to participation, all patients will provide written informed consent. The results of the trial are intended to be published in a peer-reviewed journal. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ChiCTR2300076862.
