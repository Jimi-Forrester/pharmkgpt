35315205|t|The efficacy and safety of nurse-initiated sedation management in an intensive care unit: A two-phase prospective study in Japan.
35315205|a|AIM: This study aimed to evaluate whether nurse-initiated sedation management could provide more appropriate sedation compared to usual care in a Japanese intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS: We conducted a single-center, prospective observational study before and after implementing nurse-initiated sedation using instruction sheets. Patients who had been admitted to a general adult ICU were enrolled. Before our ICU started nurse-initiated sedation (pre-implementation care), adjustment of sedatives and analgesics was performed only by a physician's written or verbal order; however, after implementing nurse-initiated sedation, nurses titrated drugs using instruction sheets. The primary outcome was the efficacy of nurse-initiated sedation, evaluated by the proportion achieving the target Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) score. The analgesic status evaluated by Critical-Care Pain Observation Tool (CPOT), days of delirium, ventilator days, ICU mortality and hospital mortality were also evaluated. RESULTS: The study examined 30 patients in the pre-implementation care phase and 30 patients in the nurse-initiated sedation phase. The proportions achieving the target RASS were 68% in the nurse-initiated sedation group and 42% in the pre-implementation care group (mean difference, 25%; 95% confidence interval, 13.4%-37.5%; P <.001). Almost all measured CPOT were within the range of 0-3 during both phases. Days of delirium, ventilator days, ICU survival, and hospital survival did not differ significantly between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Nurse-initiated sedation management achieved a significantly higher degree of target sedation status and was incorporated as part of the care in our ICU. It is a safe approach in countries, such as Japan, where sedation protocols are not widely used.
