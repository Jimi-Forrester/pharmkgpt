39801125|a|BACKGROUND: Pharmacological treatment of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia is of limited benefit. The addition of non-pharmacological interventions is often essential for optimal symptom control. Music is a viable way to help patients communicate and improve their quality of life. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to find the most effective way to use music in a busy dementia ward. METHODS: 17 inpatients (aged 63-93 years) with a clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and dementia took part over five weeks. Music lyrics presented via free-field speakers were individualized to personal preferences. Instruments (e.g., maracas) were used in some group sessions. We used the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q) and Music in Dementia Assessment Scales (MiDAS) to evaluate patients' behavior before and after musical intervention. RESULTS: There was a significant difference in mean NPI-Q scores before and after the music intervention. Specifically, Delusion, Motor Disturbances, and Agitation scores were significantly reduced after music intervention. This was accompanied by significant improvements in Interest, Response, and Enjoyment of MiDAS items during specific intervals. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical professionals can successfully deliver music-based intervention to inpatients with advanced dementia to help manage their behavioral symptoms in the short term. Music-based interventions' use for inpatient wards must be further investigated as an economical and personalized non-pharmacological therapeutic tool for patients with dementia.
