39868491|t|A multi-cohort study of longitudinal and cross-sectional Alzheimer's disease biomarkers in cognitively unimpaired older adults.
39868491|a|INTRODUCTION: The generalizability of neuroimaging and cognitive biomarkers in their sensitivity to detect preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) and power to predict progression in large, multisite cohorts remains unclear. METHOD: Longitudinal demographics, T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and cognitive scores of 3036 cognitively unimpaired (CU) older adults (amyloid beta [Abeta]-negative/positive [A-/A+]: 1270/1558) were included. Cross-sectional and longitudinal cognition and medial temporal lobe (MTL) structural measures were extracted. Cross-sectional MTL tau burden (T) was computed from tau positron emission tomography (N = 1095). RESULTS: We found cross-sectional tau and longitudinal structural biomarkers best separated A+ CU from A- CU. A-T+ CU had significantly faster neurodegeneration rate compared to A-T- CU. MTL tau was significantly correlated with MRI and cognitive biomarkers regardless of Abeta status. MTL tau, MRI, and cognition provided complementary information about disease progression. DISCUSSION: This large multisite study replicates prior findings in CU older adults, supporting the utility of neuroimaging and cognitive biomarkers in preclinical AD clinical trials and normal aging studies. HIGHLIGHTS: We investigated neuroimaging and cognitive biomarkers in 3036 cognitively unimpaired (CU) participants. Medial temporal lobe (MTL) tau and longitudinal MTL atrophy best separate amyloid beta positive (A+) CU from amyloid beta negative (A-) CU. A- tau positive (T+) CU had a significantly faster neurodegeneration rate compared to A-T- CU. MTL tau correlated with structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and cognition regardless of amyloid beta status. Combined baseline MTL tau, MRI, and cognition best predict Alzheimer's disease progression.
