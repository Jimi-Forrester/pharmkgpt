35900595|a|Human heat-shock protein 90 (HSP90) has four functional domains, including NH2-terminal (N), charged linker region (LR), middle (M) and COOH-terminal (C) domains. In kidney stone disease (or nephrolithiasis/urolithiasis), HSP90 serves as a receptor for calcium oxalate monohydrate (COM), which is the most common crystal to form kidney stones. Nevertheless, roles of HSP90 and its four domains in kidney stone formation remained unclear and under-investigated. We thus examined and compared their effects on COM crystals during physical (crystallization, growth and aggregation) and biological (crystal-cell adhesion and crystal invasion through extracellular matrix (ECM)) pathogenic processes of kidney stone formation. The analyses revealed that full-length (FL) HSP90 obviously increased COM crystal size and abundance during crystallization and markedly promoted crystal growth, aggregation, adhesion onto renal cells and ECM invasion. Comparing among four individual domains, N and C domains exhibited the strongest promoting effects, whereas LR domain had the weakest promoting effects on COM crystals. In summary, our findings indicate that FL-HSP90 and its four domains (N, LR, M and C) promote COM crystallization, crystal growth, aggregation, adhesion onto renal cells and invasion through the ECM, all of which are the important physical and biological pathogenic processes of kidney stone formation.
