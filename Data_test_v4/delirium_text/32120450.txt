32120450|t|A nurse-driven enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) nursing program for geriatric patients following lung surgery.
32120450|a|Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) is a multiprofessional, multidisciplinary and evidence-based program that aims to reduce complications, improve overall prognosis, shorten hospital stays, and promote fast recovery following major surgery. Nurses play a crucial role in the successful implementation of the ERAS program. Therefore, this research focuses on the trajectory optimized and acquired by nurses in the enhanced recovery of elderly patients undergoing radical surgery for lung cancer. This study concludes that the implementation of the proposed ERAS preoperative point-of-care trajectory is highly beneficial for improved outcomes and enhanced recovery of geriatric patients following lung surgery.
