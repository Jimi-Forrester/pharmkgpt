9862635|a|Neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) form in a number of neurodegenerative disorders. In Alzheimer disease (AD), intracellular NFTs (iNFTs) develop along with extracellular beta-amyloid (Abeta) deposits. Reports on whether NFTs have Abeta associated with them are inconsistent. Here we study NFTs and their direct relationship with Abeta-like fragments in cases of AD, Down Syndrome, and the parkinsonism-dementia complex of Guam, using a panel of antibodies which recognize different epitopes of Abeta. In all diseases, as well as in the aged controls, the majority of extracellular NFTs (eNFTs) are stained with antibodies recognizing the 40 carboxy-terminal of Abeta, but not other epitopes. Such staining is morphologically distinguishable from the previously described Abeta positive 'tangle associated amyloid deposits' (TAADs), which surround some eNFTs, and are immunopositive for all epitopes of the Abeta molecule. Some iNFTs are immunoreactive with antibodies to the 42 carboxy-terminal epitope, and, to a lesser extent, with antibodies to midportions and more N-terminal epitopes of Abeta. These results may indicate a direct interaction between Abeta and NFTs, although secondary deposition or crossreactivity with other epitopes associated with NFTs cannot be ruled out.
