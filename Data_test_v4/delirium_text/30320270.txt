30320270|t|Effect of Urea, Arginine, and Ethanol Concentration on Aggregation of 179CVNITV184 Fragment of Sheep Prion Protein.
30320270|a|Understanding protein aggregation is of utmost importance as it is responsible for causing several neurodegenerative diseases and one of the serious impediments in large-scale biopharmaceutical production. The prion protein is responsible for pathological states in fatal transmissible spongiform conditions, such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and bovine spongiform encephalopathy. The peptide fragment 178-191 of Syrian hamster prion protein is known to be amyloidogenic. Here, we identified the fragment 179CVNITV184 as an aggregation-prone fragment in sheep prion protein. This fragment is conserved sequence among sheep and Syrian hamster prion protein and also falls in the previously identified amyloidogenic sequence. The mechanistic details of the aggregation behavior are analyzed in three different concentrations of urea, arginine, and ethanol. Urea and arginine are found to be aggregation suppressors, but ethanol enhances the protein aggregation through beta-sheet formation. We have also analyzed the influence of these osmolyte on water dynamics in the presence of the octamer of this aggregation-prone fragment and correlated this water dynamics with the aggregation behavior of the octamer.
