36482678|t|Enhancing Dementia Knowledge and Self-Efficacy of In-Home Supportive Services Caregivers Through Online Training.
36482678|a|California's In-Home Supportive Services (IHSS) program provides vital home care to low-income consumers, some of whom live with Alzheimer's disease or related dementias (ADRD). Yet, most IHSS caregivers receive little or no training in dementia care. We present preliminary descriptive results of the IHSS + ADRD Training Project, a 10-week, competency-based, dementia training program, delivered online, for IHSS caregivers, in Alameda County. Increase in dementia knowledge and self-efficacy at training completion supports the importance of continuing and expanding this work.
