37325452|t|Multidimensional futuristic approaches to address the pandemics beyond COVID-19.
37325452|a|Globally, the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been enormous and unrelenting with ~6.9 million deaths and ~765 million infections. This review mainly focuses on the recent advances and potentially novel molecular tools for viral diagnostics and therapeutics with far-reaching implications in managing the future pandemics. In addition to briefly highlighting the existing and recent methods of viral diagnostics, we propose a couple of potentially novel non-PCR-based methods for rapid, cost-effective, and single-step detection of nucleic acids of viruses using RNA mimics of green fluorescent protein (GFP) and nuclease-based approaches. We also highlight key innovations in miniaturized Lab-on-Chip (LoC) devices, which in combination with cyber-physical systems, could serve as ideal futuristic platforms for viral diagnosis and disease management. We also discuss underexplored and underutilized antiviral strategies, including ribozyme-mediated RNA-cleaving tools for targeting viral RNA, and recent advances in plant-based platforms for rapid, low-cost, and large-scale production and oral delivery of antiviral agents/vaccines. Lastly, we propose repurposing of the existing vaccines for newer applications with a major emphasis on Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG)-based vaccine engineering.
