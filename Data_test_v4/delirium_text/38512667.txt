38512667|t|Preparation of Tau Condensates by Liquid-Liquid Phase Separation to Study Tau Amyloid Aggregation.
38512667|a|Protein liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) has been associated with protein amyloid aggregation. Amyloid aggregation of tau is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases. This protocol provides steps to prepare tau condensates via LLPS, so that researchers can further study its driving forces and its relationship with tau amyloid aggregation.
