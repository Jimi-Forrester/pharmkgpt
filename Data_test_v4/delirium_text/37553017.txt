37553017|a|BACKGROUND: Numerous studies summarized in a recent meta-analysis have shown sleep deprivation rapidly improves depressive symptoms in approximately 50 % of individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD), however those studies were typically conducted in clinical settings. Here we investigated the effects of sleep deprivation utilizing a highly controlled experimental approach. METHODS: 36 antidepressant-free individuals with MDD and 10 healthy controls (HC) completed a 5 day/4-night protocol consisting of adaptation, baseline, total sleep deprivation (TSD), and recovery phases. Light was kept consistently dim (<=50 lx), meals were regulated, and activity was restricted. In-the-moment mood was assessed using a modified Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) at screening and each morning following the experimental nights. RESULTS: Day of study had a significant effect on mood in both groups. Post-hoc analyses revealed that significant effects were attributed to mood improvement in the MDD group following study initiation prior to beginning TSD, and in the HC group following recovery sleep, but were not due to mood improvement in the MDD group during TSD. No further improvement in mood occurred during 36 h of TSD. LIMITATIONS: Strict eligibility requirements may limit generalizability. The requirement to be medication free may have biased toward a less severely depressed sample. CONCLUSIONS: Results revealed that individuals with moderate MDD can experience a significant reduction in depressive symptoms upon entering a highly controlled laboratory environment. Environmental effects on mood can be substantial and need to be considered.
