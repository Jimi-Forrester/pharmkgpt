38947101|t|Therapeutic Potential of Nitrogen-Doped Rutin-Bound Glucose Carbon Dots for Alzheimer's Disease.
38947101|a|The blood-brain barrier (BBB) prevents the use of many drugs for the treatment of neurological disorders. Recently, nitrogen-doped carbon dots (NCDs) have emerged as promising nanocarriers to cross BBB. The primary focus of our study was to evaluate the effectiveness of NCDs for the symptomatic treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, we developed and characterized NCDs bound to rutin, a flavonoid with known benefits for AD. Despite its benefits, the transportation of rutin via NCDs for AD therapy has not been explored previously. We characterized the particles using FTIR and UV-visible spectroscopy followed by atomic force microscopy. Once the design was optimized and validated, we performed in vivo testing via a hemolytic assay to optimize the dosage. Preliminary in vitro testing was performed in AlCl3-induced rat models of AD whereby a single dose of 10 mg/kg NCDs-rutin was administered intraperitoneally. Interestingly, this single dose of 10 mg/kg NCDs-rutin produced the same behavioral effects as 50 mg/kg rutin administered intraperitoneally for 1 month. Similarly, histological and biomarker profiles (SOD2 and TLR4) also presented significant protective effects of NCDs-rutin against neuronal loss, inflammation, and oxidative stress. Hence, NCDs-rutin are a promising approach for the treatment of neurological diseases.
