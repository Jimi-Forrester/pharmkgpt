22790929|a|Oxidative stress is involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegeneration. Amyloid beta (Abeta) oligomer as an intermediate of aggregates causes memory loss in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We have suggested that oxidative stress plays an important role in Abeta oligomerization and cognitive impairment using a human amyloid precursor protein (hAPP) transgenic AD mice lacking cytoplasmic superoxide dismutase (hAPP/Sod1-/-). Recently, clinical trials revealed inhibitors of Abeta production from hAPP as promising therapeutics, but the relationship between oxidative stress and Abeta metabolism remains unclear. Here we found that Sod1 deficiency enhanced beta-cleavage of hAPP, suggesting that it increased Abeta production in hAPP/Sod1-/- mice. In contrast, Abeta degradation did not decrease in hAPP/Sod1-/- as compared with hAPP/Sod1+/+ mice. Furthermore, we successfully detected in situ superoxide radicals associated with increased protein carbonylation in hAPP/Sod1-/-. These results suggest that cytoplasmic oxidative stress is involved in Abeta production as well as aggregation during AD progression.
