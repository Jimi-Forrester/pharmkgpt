38555032|a|Accumulation of misfolded proteins and protein aggregates leading to degeneration of neurons is a hallmark of several neurodegenerative diseases. Therapy mostly relies on symptomatic relief. Immunotherapy offers a promising approach for the development of disease-modifying routes. Such strategies have shown remarkable results in oncology, and this promise is increasingly being realized for neurodegenerative diseases in advanced preclinical and clinical studies. This review highlights cases of passive and active immunotherapies in Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. The reasons for success and failure, wherever available, and strategies to cross the blood-brain barrier, are discussed. The need for conditional modulation of the immune response is also reflected on.
