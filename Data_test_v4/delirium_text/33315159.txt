33315159|t|Associating gene expressions with curcuminoid biosynthesis in turmeric.
33315159|a|BACKGROUND: Biologically important curcuminoids viz curcumin, demethoxycurcumin, and bisdemethoxycurcumin in turmeric rhizome have several health benefits. Pharmaceutical industries synthesize curcuminoids manipulating gene expressions in vitro or in vivo because of their medicinal importance. In this experiment, we studied the gene expressions involved in the curcuminoid biosynthesis pathway in association with curcuminoid yield in turmeric rhizome to study the impact of individual gene expression on curcuminoid biosynthesis. RESULTS: Gene expressions at the different growth stages of turmeric rhizome were association tested with respective curcuminoid contents. Gene expression patterns of diketide-CoA synthase (DCS) and multiple curcumin synthases (CURSs) viz curcumin synthase 1 (CURS1), curcumin synthase 2 (CURS2), and curcumin synthase 3 (CURS3) were differentially associated with different curcuminoid contents. Genotype and growth stages showed a significant effect on the gene expressions resulting in a significant impact on curcuminoid balance in turmeric rhizome. DCS and CURS3 expression patterns were similar but distinct from CURS1 and CURS2 expression patterns in turmeric rhizome. DCS expression had a significant positive and CURS3 expression had a significant negative association with curcumin, demethoxycurcumin, bisdemethoxycurcumin, and total curcuminoid in turmeric rhizome. CURS1 expression had a negative association with curcumin whereas CURS2 expression showed a positive association with demethoxycurcumin. CONCLUSIONS: The effects of DCS and CURS expressions are not always positive with different curcuminoid contents in turmeric rhizome. DCS expression has a positive and CURS3 expression has a negative association with curcuminoids. CURS1 and CURS2 are also associated with curcumin and demethoxycurcumin synthesis. This mechanism of co-expression of diketide-CoA synthase and multiple curcumin synthases in turmeric rhizome has a significant effect on curcuminoid balance in different turmeric cultivars. Further experiment will explore more insights; however, association-based test results from this experiment can be useful in improving curcuminoid yield in turmeric rhizome or in vitro through the application of genetic engineering and biotechnology.
