26178209|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the expression of Girdin and its significance in Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: Fifty-nine autopsy cases from Department of Pathology, Beijing Hospital from January 1988 to December 2013, including 35 AD cases and 24 non-AD cases as control. Girdin and amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) expression was evaluated immunohistochemically by EnVision method. The correlation between Girdin and Abeta was analyzed. RESULTS: Girdin expression was localized in the nucleus and/or cytoplasm. The expression rates of Girdin were 20.0% (7/35) in the AD group and 83.3% (20/24) in the non-AD group, respectively. The difference was significant (Yates's correction for continuity chi(2)=20.527, P<0.05). Girdin expression and Abeta deposition also correlated significantly (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Girdin shows reduced expression in AD, and is correlated positively with Abeta deposition. This suggests that Girdin may play an important role in the occurrence and development of AD.
