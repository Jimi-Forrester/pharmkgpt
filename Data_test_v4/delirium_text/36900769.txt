36900769|a|The aim of this study was to assess the patterns and trends of pharmacological treatment for outpatients with postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) in China in the period 2015-2019. Prescription data for outpatients with PHN were extracted from the database of the Hospital Prescription Analysis Program of China according to the inclusion criteria. The trends in yearly prescriptions and corresponding costs were analyzed and stratified by drug class and specific drugs. A total of 19,196 prescriptions from 49 hospitals in 6 major regions of China were included for analysis. The yearly prescriptions increased from 2534 in 2015 to 5676 in 2019 (p = 0.027), and the corresponding expenditures increased from CNY 898,618 in 2015 to CNY 2,466,238 in 2019 (p = 0.027). Gabapentin and pregabalin are the most commonly used drugs for PHN, and more than 30% of these two drugs were combined with mecobalamin. Opioids were the second most frequently prescribed drug class, and oxycodone accounted for the largest share of the cost. Topical drugs and TCAs are rarely used. The frequent use of pregabalin and gabapentin was in accordance with current guidelines; however, the use of oxycodone raised concerns about rationality and economic burden. The results of this study may benefit the allocation of medical resources and management for PHN in China and other countries.
