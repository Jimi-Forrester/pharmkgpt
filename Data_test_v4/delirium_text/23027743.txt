23027743|a|The Alzheimer's disease-associated protein tau is an intrinsically disordered protein with no preferred structure in solution. Under physiological conditions, tau binds to microtubules and regulates their dynamics, whereas during the development of neurodegeneration tau dissociates from microtubules, misfolds and creates highly insoluble deposits. To elucidate the determinants of tau-protein misfolding, tau peptides from microtubule-binding motifs were crystallized in complexes with Fab fragments of specific monoclonal antibodies. The crystals diffracted to 1.69 A resolution and gave complete data sets using a synchrotron X-ray source. Molecular replacement was used to solve the phase problem.
