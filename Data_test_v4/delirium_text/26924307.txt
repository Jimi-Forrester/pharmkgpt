26924307|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate electrophysiological parameters of swallowing in all stages of Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: Forty Alzheimer's disease patients, 20 age-matched normal controls and 20 young normal controls were included. Dysphagia limit (DL) and sequential water swallowing (SWS) tests were performed. Cardiac rhythm, respiration and sympathetic skin responses were concomitantly recorded. RESULTS: Dysphagia was found in 30/40 (75%) of Alzheimer's disease patients. Mean volume at the DL test was significantly reduced (16.5+-1.0mL) in the Alzheimer's disease group. Swallowing and apnea times in the SWS test were significantly prolonged in elderly controls, but even longer in Alzheimer's disease patients. CONCLUSIONS: Alzheimer's disease patients had electrophysiological features of dysphagia, even in the early period of disease. The cortical involvement and severity of cognitive disorder can increase swallowing problems, but subclinical signs of dysphagia may be observed even in patients with mild or moderate Alzheimer's disease.
