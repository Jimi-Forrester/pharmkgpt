37569829|t|Changes in the Mitochondria in the Aging Process-Can alpha-Tocopherol Affect Them?
37569829|a|Aerobic organisms use molecular oxygen in several reactions, including those in which the oxidation of substrate molecules is coupled to oxygen reduction to produce large amounts of metabolic energy. The utilization of oxygen is associated with the production of ROS, which can damage biological macromolecules but also act as signaling molecules, regulating numerous cellular processes. Mitochondria are the cellular sites where most of the metabolic energy is produced and perform numerous physiological functions by acting as regulatory hubs of cellular metabolism. They retain the remnants of their bacterial ancestors, including an independent genome that encodes part of their protein equipment; they have an accurate quality control system; and control of cellular functions also depends on communication with the nucleus. During aging, mitochondria can undergo dysfunctions, some of which are mediated by ROS. In this review, after a description of how aging affects the mitochondrial quality and quality control system and the involvement of mitochondria in inflammation, we report information on how vitamin E, the main fat-soluble antioxidant, can protect mitochondria from age-related changes. The information in this regard is scarce and limited to some tissues and some aspects of mitochondrial alterations in aging. Improving knowledge of the effects of vitamin E on aging is essential to defining an optimal strategy for healthy aging.
