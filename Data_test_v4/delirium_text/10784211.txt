10784211|a|Orphenadrine (N,N-dimethyl-2(o-methyl-alpha-phenylbenzyloxy)ethylamine) is an analog of diphenhydramine with central and peripheral anticholinergic properties. It is commonly prescribed both as a muscle relaxant and as an adjunct to antipsychotic medications to prevent parkinsonism. We report a case of orphenadrine poisoning in a 3-year-old boy following ingestion of no more than two 100-mg tablets. Central anticholinergic toxicity was prominent, manifested by hallucinations and severe agitation. Orphenadrine can cause profound toxicity in children after ingestion of small doses, and should be considered as a potential cause for acute delirium in childhood.
