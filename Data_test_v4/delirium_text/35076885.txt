35076885|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To present new findings in order to aid in the provision of high-quality symptom management and psychosocial care for adolescents and young adults with advanced cancer at the end of life. RECENT FINDINGS: Behavioral health providers support patients by teaching them symptom control skills, building legacies, and making meaning of their lives. Integration of cultural values is essential for comprehensive assessment and decision-making. Effective management of physiological symptoms and psychological distress begins with accurate communication about prognosis and goals of care that focus on patient preferences and priorities. Oncology teams promote quality of life and the successful management of fatigue, pain, decreased mobility, poor appetite, and dyspnea with the early inclusion of palliative care. While provision of end-of-life care in a young person with cancer presents challenges, multidisciplinary teams can effectively accompany patients in this journey by prioritizing patient and family preferences to promote quality of life.
