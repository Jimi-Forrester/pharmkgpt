35097067|a|BACKGROUND: Based on the results of some large randomized controlled trials (RCTs) confirmed the efficacy of corticosteroids in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), corticosteroids have been included in World Health Organization guidelines, but remain controversial. AIM: To investigate the efficacy and safety of low-to-moderate dose (30 to 40 mg/d) short-term methylprednisolone for COVID-19 patients. METHODS: The clinical data of 70 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 who received antiviral therapy with Arbidol for 7-10 d before admission but had no obvious absorption on chest computed tomography (CT) imaging were retrospectively analyzed. Arbidol (as the control group) and methylprednisolone (as the corticosteroid group) were given respectively after admission. After treatment, chest CT was reexamined to evaluate the absorption of pulmonary lesions. Additionally, we evaluated and compared the lymphocyte count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), interleukin-6(IL-6), serum ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), hypersensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and D-dimer levels, and also analyzed the incidence of toxic and side effects. RESULTS: All patients in the corticosteroid group had varying degrees of CT absorption, which was significantly better than that in the control group (CT obvious absorption rate: 89.47% vs 12.5%, P < 0.05). The average daily dose and course of methylprednisolone in the patients with significant improvement on chest CT was (38.55 +- 13.17) mg and (6.44 +- 1.86) d respectively. During the treatment, the lymphocyte count, ESR, IL-6, serum ferritin, LDH, CK-MB, hs-CRP and D-dimer levels all improved gradually, indicating that both Arbidol and methylprednisolone therapy were contributed to improving the condition of COVID-19 patients. The corticosteroid regimen did not prolong the clearance time of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. There were no severe adverse reactions such as gastrointestinal bleeding, secondary severe infection, hypertension, diabetic ketoacidosis, mental disorders or electrolyte disorders during the whole corticosteroid treatment process. CONCLUSION: Low-to-moderate dose short-term methylprednisolone can accelerate the chest CT imaging absorption of COVID-19 so as to improve symptoms and alleviate the condition in a short term, reduce the hospital stay, meanwhile avoid severe COVID-19 phases. The protocol has been proven to be effective and safe in clinical use.
