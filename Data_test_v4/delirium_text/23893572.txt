23893572|t|Context dependence of protein misfolding and structural strains in neurodegenerative diseases.
23893572|a|Vast arrays of structural forms are accessible to simple amyloid peptides and environmental conditions can direct assembly into single phases. These insights are now being applied to the aggregation of the Abeta peptide of Alzheimer's disease and the identification of causative phases. We extend use of the imaging agent Pittsburgh compound B to discriminate among Abeta phases and begin to define conditions of relevance to the disease state. Also, we specifically highlight the development of methods for defining the structures of these more complex phases.
