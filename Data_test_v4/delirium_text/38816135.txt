38816135|t|Characterization of self-templating catalytic amyloids.
38816135|a|Amyloid aggregates with unique periodic structures have garnered significant attention due to their association with numerous diseases, including systemic amyloidoses and the neurodegenerative diseases Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and Creutzfeld-Jakob. However, more recent investigations have expanded our understanding of amyloids, revealing their diverse functional biological roles. Amyloids have also been proposed to have played a significant role in prebiotic molecular evolution because of their exceptional stability, spontaneous formation in a prebiotic environment, catalytic and templating abilities, and cooperative interaction with fatty acids, polysaccharides, and nucleic acids. This chapter summarizes methods and techniques associated with studying short amyloidogenic peptides, including detailed procedures for investigating cross-templating and autocatalytic templating reactions. Since the work with amyloidogenic peptides and their aggregates present unique challenges, we have attempted to address these with essential details throughout the procedures. The lessons herein may be used in any amyloid-related research to ensure more reproducible results and reduce entrance barriers for researchers new to the field.
