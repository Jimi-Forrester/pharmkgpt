24555698|t|The burden and treatment of diabetes in France.
24555698|a|BACKGROUND: The objective of this review was to describe and situate the burden and treatment of diabetes within the broader context of the French health care system. METHODS: Literature review on the burden, treatment and outcomes of diabetes in France, complemented by personal communication with with diabetes experts in the Paris public hospital system. RESULTS: Prevalence of diabetes in the French population is estimated at 6%. Diabetes has the highest prevalence among all chronic conditions covered 100% by France's statutory health insurance (SHI), and the number of covered patients has doubled in the past 10 years. In 2010, the SHI cost for pharmacologically-treated diabetes patients amounted to $17.7 billion, including an estimated $2.5 billion directly related to diabetes treatment and prevention and $4.2 billion for treatment of diabetes-related complications. In 2007, the average annual SHI cost was $6 930 for patients with type 1 diabetes and $4 890 for patients with type 2 diabetes. Complications are associated with significantly increased costs. Diabetes is a leading cause of adult blindness, amputation and dialysis in France, which also has one of the highest rates of end-stage renal disease in Europe. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death among people with diabetes. Historically, the French health care system has been more oriented to curative acute care rather than preventive medicine and management of long-term chronic diseases. More recently, the government has focused on primary prevention as part of its national nutrition and health program, with the goal of reducing overweight and obesity in adults and children. It has also recognized the critical role of the patient in managing chronic diseases such as diabetes and has put into place a free patient support program called "sophia". Additional initiatives focus on therapeutic patient education (TPE) and the development of personalized patient pathways. CONCLUSIONS: While France has been successful in protecting patients from the financial consequences of diabetes through its SHI coverage, improvements are necessary in the areas of prevention, monitoring and reducing the incidence of complications. Systemic changes must be made to improve the coordination and delivery of chronic care.
