37781241|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in the world, and alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) abnormal aggregate and mitochondrial dysfunction play a crucial role in its pathological development. Recent studies have revealed that proteins can form condensates through liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), and LLPS has been found to be widely present in alpha-syn aberrant aggregate and mitophagy-related protein physiological processes. This review summarizes the occurrence of alpha-syn LLPS and its influencing factors, introduces the production and transformation of the related protein LLPS during PINK1-Parkin-mediated mitophagy, hoping to provide new ideas and methods for the study of PD pathology.
