28828226|a|OBJECTIVE: Inflammation correlates with delirium. Galectin-3 is a proinflammatory protein. This study aimed to determine relation of serum galectin-3 levels to delirium of postpartum intensive care unit (ICU) women. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective observational study, serum galectin-3, S100B, and C-reactive protein levels of 412 postpartum ICU women and 412 healthy women were measured. Delirium and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Care Evaluation II (APCHCE II) scores were recorded. RESULTS: Serum levels of galectin-3, S100B, and C-reactive protein were significantly elevated in the postpartum women than in the healthy women. Galectin-3 levels were highly associated with APCHCE II scores and S100B and C-reactive protein levels. Galectin-3, C-reactive protein, and S100B levels and APCHCE II scores were identified as independent predictors for delirium. Area under the curve (AUC) of serum galectin-3 levels was similar to that of S100B levels, and significantly exceeded those of C-reactive protein levels and APCHCE II scores. Moreover, galectin-3 significantly improved the AUCs of APCHCE II scores, S100B levels, and C-reactive protein levels. CONCLUSIONS: Galectin-3, involved in inflammatory process underlying delirium-related brain injury, might be a potential biomarker to predict delirium of postpartum ICU women.
