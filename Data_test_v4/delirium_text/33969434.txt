33969434|t|A phase I study assessing the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol-lowering activity of immunotherapeutics targeting PCSK9.
33969434|a|PURPOSE: AT04A and AT06A are two AFFITOPE  peptide vaccine candidates being developed for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia by inducing proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9)-specific antibodies. This study aimed to investigate safety, tolerability, antibody development, and reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLc) following four subcutaneous immunizations. METHODS: This phase I, single-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study was conducted in a total of 72 healthy subjects with a mean fasting LDLc level at baseline of 117.1 mg/dL (range 77-196 mg/dL). Each cohort enrolled 24 subjects to receive three priming immunizations at weeks 0, 4, and 8 and to receive a single booster immunization at week 60 of either AT04A, AT06A, or placebo. In addition to safety (primary objective), the antigenic peptide- and PCSK9-specific antibody response and the impact on LDLc were evaluated over a period of 90 weeks. RESULTS: The most common systemic treatment-related adverse events (AEs) reported were fatigue, headache, and myalgia in 75% of subjects in the AT06A group and 58% and 46% of subjects in the placebo and AT04A groups, respectively. Injection site reactions (ISR) representing 63% of all treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), were transient and mostly of mild or moderate intensity and rarely severe (3%). Both active treatments triggered a robust, long-lasting antibody response towards the antigenic peptides used for immunization that optimally cross-reacted with the target epitope on PCSK9. In the AT04A group, a reduction in serum LDLc was observed with a mean peak reduction of 11.2% and 13.3% from baseline compared to placebo at week 20 and 70 respectively, and over the whole study period, the mean LDLc reduction for the AT04A group vs. placebo was -7.2% (95% CI [-10.4 to -3.9], P < 0.0001). In this group, PCSK9 target epitope titers above 50 were associated with clinically relevant LDLc reductions with an individual maximal decrease of 39%. CONCLUSIONS: Although both AT04A and AT06 were safe and immunogenic, only AT04A demonstrated significant LDLc-lowering activity, justifying further development.
