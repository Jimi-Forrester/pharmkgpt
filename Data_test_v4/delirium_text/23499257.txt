23499257|a|It remains unclear whether monocyte infiltration plays a protective or detrimental role in neurodegenerative disease. The present study characterizes the inflammatory status of primary monocytes in a novel in vitro perfusion model. Monocytes under perfusion do not undergo elevated cell death. However, perfusion does lead to altered morphology, which can be counteracted by anti-inflammatory drugs. Functional studies indicate that cytokine levels are significantly reduced in perfusion compared to stationary conditions and enhanced with brain slices or capillary endothelial cells. Understanding monocyte properties could lead to refined treatment and new ways to interfere with inflammation in diseased brains.
