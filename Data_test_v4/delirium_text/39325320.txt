39325320|a|Recent advancements in the development of positron emission tomography (PET) tracers have significantly enhanced our ability to image neuroinflammatory processes and neurotransmitter systems, which are vital for understanding and treating neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders. Similarly, innovative tracers in oncology provide detailed images of the metabolic and molecular characteristics of tumors, which are crucial for tailoring targeted therapies and monitoring responses, including radiotherapy. Notable advancements include programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1)-targeting agents for lung cancer, prostate-specific membrane antigen-based tracers for prostate cancer, chemokine receptor-targeting agents for hematological malignancies, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-targeting tracers for various cancers, Claudin 18 based tracers for epithelial tumors, glutamine tracers for colorectal cancer, and ascorbic acid analogs for assessing cancer metabolism and therapy efficacy. Additionally, novel tracers have been developed for non-neurological and non-oncological applications, including adrenal imaging, amyloidosis, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. This overview focuses on the newly developed tracers, particularly those used in neurology and oncology.
