36750905|t|Behavioral, biochemical and histopathological toxic profiles induced by sub-chronic cannabimimetic WIN55, 212-2 administration in mice.
36750905|a|WIN55, 212-2 mesylate is a synthetic cannabinoid (SC) agonist of CB1 and CB2 receptors with much higher affinity to CB1 receptor than tetrahydrocannabinol and many potential therapeutic effects. Few studies have evaluated SCs effects on more complex animal behavior and sex differences in cannabinoids toxicology. The current study was undertaken for determination of behavioral (Open Field test), biochemical (liver and kidney function test plus GABA & Glutamate levels), histopathological and CB1 immunohistochemistry risks of sub-chronic administration of SC WIN55, 212-2 mesylate in male and female mice. A total of 40 healthy adult mice were randomly divided into four groups (5 mice each): a negative control group, a vehicle group, a low dose (0.05 mg/kg) group and a high dose group (0.1 mg/kg) for each gender.Open Field Test revealed dose and gender-dependent anxiogenic effect with reduced locomotor activity in both sexes especially the higher doses with female mice being less compromised. GABA and glutamate levels increased significantly in both dose groups compared to controls alongside female mice versus males. No significant biochemical alterations were found in all groups with minimal histopathological changes. The CB1 receptors immunohistochemistry revealed a significant increase in the number of CB1 positive neurons in both low and high dose groups against controls with higher expression in female brains.ConclusionsThere were sexual dimorphism effects induced by sub-chronic exposure to WIN55, 212-2 with lesser female mice affection and dose-dependent influences.
