34920170|t|Modulating physicochemical properties of tetrahydropyridine-2-amine BACE1 inhibitors with electron-withdrawing groups: A systematic study.
34920170|a|A common challenge for medicinal chemists is to reduce the pKa of strongly basic groups' conjugate acids into a range that preserves the desired effects, usually potency and/or solubility, but avoids undesired effects like high volume of distribution (Vd), limited membrane permeation, and off-target binding to, notably, the hERG channel and monoamine receptors. We faced this challenge with a 3,4,5,6-tetrahydropyridine-2-amine scaffold harboring an amidine, a key structural component of potential inhibitors of BACE1, the rate-limiting enzyme in the production of Abeta species that make up amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease. In our endeavor to balance potency with desirable properties to achieve brain penetration, we introduced a diverse set of groups in beta position of the amidine that modulate logD, PSA and pKa. Given the synthetic challenge to prepare these highly functionalized warheads, we first developed a design flow including predicted physicochemical parameters which allowed us to select only the most promising candidates for synthesis. For this we evaluated a set of commercial packages to predict physicochemical properties, which can guide medicinal chemists in their endeavors to modulate pKa values of amidine and amine bases.
