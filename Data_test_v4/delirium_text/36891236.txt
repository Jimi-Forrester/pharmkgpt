36891236|t|UPLC-MS based integrated plasma proteomic and metabolomic profiling of TSC-RAML and its relationship with everolimus treatment.
36891236|a|Aim: To profile the plasma proteomics and metabolomics of patients with renal cysts, sporadic angiomyolipoma (S-AML) and tuberous sclerosis complex related angiomyolipoma (TSC-RAML) before and after everolimus treatment, and to find potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers as well as reveal the underlying mechanism of TSC tumorigenesis. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively measured the plasma proteins and metabolites from November 2016 to November 2017 in a cohort of pre-treatment and post-treatment TSC-RAML patients and compared them with renal cyst and S-AML patients by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometer (UPLC-MS). The tumor reduction rates of TSC-RAML were assessed and correlated with the plasma protein and metabolite levels. In addition, functional analysis based on differentially expressed molecules was performed to reveal the underlying mechanisms. Results: Eighty-five patients with one hundred and ten plasma samples were enrolled in our study. Multiple proteins and metabolites, such as pre-melanosome protein (PMEL) and S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), demonstrated both diagnostic and prognostic effects. Functional analysis revealed many dysregulated pathways, including angiogenesis synthesis, smooth muscle proliferation and migration, amino acid metabolism and glycerophospholipid metabolism. Conclusion: The plasma proteomics and metabolomics pattern of TSC-RAML was clearly different from that of other renal tumors, and the differentially expressed plasma molecules could be used as prognostic and diagnostic biomarkers. The dysregulated pathways, such as angiogenesis and amino acid metabolism, may shed new light on the treatment of TSC-RAML.
