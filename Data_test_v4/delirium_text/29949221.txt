29949221|a|BACKGROUND: Age-related events, such as cardiopulmonary complications, delirium, transfer to a rehabilitation facility, and dependency are a major problem after hepatic resection in the elderly. This prospective multicenter study aimed to preoperatively evaluate frailty in the elderly according to a phenotypic frail index, named the "Kihon Checklist (KCL)," to predict "age-related events" after hepatic resection. METHODS: Between May 2016 and September 2017, 217 independently living patients who consented among all patients aged >=65 years who planned to undergo hepatic resection were included in the study. Preoperative frailty was defined as a total KCL score >=8. We analyzed clinical characteristics and outcomes, including age-related events (major respiratory and cardiac complications, delirium medication needed, transfer to rehabilitation facility, and dependency) between patients with and without frailty. RESULTS: Of the 217 patients, 63 and 154 were classified into the frail and non-frail groups, respectively. The incidences of age-related events (31.7% vs. 7.8%, P < 0.001) were higher in the frail group. Multivariate analysis indicated that frailty (P < 0.001, hazard ratio 5.16) and resection of >=2 sectors (P = 0.014, hazard ratio 2.98) were independent risk factors for age-related events. CONCLUSIONS: Frailty evaluated by KCL in the elderly can predict postoperative age-related events after hepatic resection.
