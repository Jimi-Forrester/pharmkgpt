38427249|t|Role of Amyloid Beta in Neurodegeneration and Therapeutic Strategies for Neuroprotection.
38427249|a|The gradual loss of neurons' structure and function in the central nervous system is known as neurodegeneration. It is a defining feature of several incapacitating illnesses, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease. The buildup of amyloid beta (Abeta) protein in the brain is one of the several variables linked to neurodegeneration. We shall delve into the fascinating realm of Abeta in this chapter and examine its role in the etiology of neurodegenerative illnesses. Insights into the processes through which Abeta exerts its toxicity are crucial for the creation of therapeutic approaches to treat these life-threatening diseases. Despite the presence of multiple obstacles, recent research shows promise for the development of some new anti-Abeta therapies that will help millions of people suffering from neurodegeneration. In this chapter, we discuss the role of Abeta in contributing to neurotoxicity and several anti-Abeta therapies for neuroprotection.
