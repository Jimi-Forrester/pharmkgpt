23612956|a|Vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) is a term used to capture the entire spectrum of cognitive impairment from mild to more severe forms and includes all forms of stroke (e.g., ischemic and hemorrhagic forms) associated and underlying cognitive impairment related with subclinical vascular brain injury. Vascular contributions to cognitive impairment are common, especially as one ages. Therefore, both stroke and Alzheimer's disease may be important causes of cognitive impairment in later life, and the concomitant occurrence of these disorders may synergize to increase the risk of poor cognition in later life. In this review we discuss the definition and clinical presentation, mechanisms, cardiovascular risk factors and possible prevention and treatment of VCI. VCI is a potentially treatable and preventable cause of cognitive impairment in later life, and familiarity with this condition will help the practitioner provide better care to patients.
