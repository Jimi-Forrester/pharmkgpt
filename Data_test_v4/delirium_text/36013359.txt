36013359|a|BACKGROUND: There are increasing data linking sleep apnea with cognitive impairment. We aimed to clarify the relationship between sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) and cognition. Detailed attention was assigned to the potential role of central versus obstructive apneic pauses in cognitive impairment. METHODS: Patients with suspected SDB were prospectively enrolled, and a complex sleep study was performed that included overnight polysomnography. A revised version of Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination (ACE-R) was used to assess cognition, evaluating overall cognition and individual subdomains. RESULTS: A total number of 101 participants were included in the study. In multivariate binary logistic regression analysis, obstructive apnea index ([OAI], 95% CI: 1.009-1.057, p = 0.008) was the only significant contributor to the model predicting attention deficit. The proportion of N1 stage of NREM sleep was the only significant contributor to the model predicting impaired verbal fluency (95% CI: 1.004-1.081, p = 0.029). No significant differences in sleep-related indices were observed in the remaining ACE-R subdomains. CONCLUSION: Except for verbal fluency and attention, we failed to find any significant association of sleep-related indices with the impairment in different cognitive subdomains. Our data suggest that impairment observed in verbal fluency is associated with a higher proportion of shallow NREM sleep, and attention deficit is associated with higher OAI. Obstructive respiratory episodes seem to play a more important role in cognitive impairment when compared to central ones.
