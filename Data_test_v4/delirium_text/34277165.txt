34277165|t|Characterizing Complications of Deep Brain Stimulation Devices for the Treatment of Parkinsonian Symptoms Without Tremor: A Federal MAUDE Database Analysis.
34277165|a|Introduction Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a modality of treatment for medication refractory Parkinson's disease (PD) in patients with debilitating motor symptoms. While potentially life-changing for individuals with Parkinson's disease, characterization of adverse events for these DBS devices have not yet been systematically organized. Therefore, the goal of this study was to characterize reported complications of DBS devices reported to the Food & Drug Administration over the last 10 years. Methods The Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database was utilized to retrieve entries reported under "Stimulator, Electrical, Implanted, For Parkinsonian Symptoms" between July 31, 2010 and August 1, 2020. After removing duplicate entries, each unique adverse event reported was sorted into complication categories based on the entries' provided narrative description. A final tabulation of complications was generated. Results The search query revealed 221 unique adverse events. The most common DBS devices were the Vercise Gevia, Vercise Cartesia and Vercise PC produced by Boston Scientific (Brian Walker, Boston Scientific, Marlborough, MA, USA). The most commonly reported complications were infection (16.2%) follow by lead migrations (8.6%). Other common causes of complications were circuit-related impedance (6.5%), cerebral bleeds (6.3%), device failure (6.3%) and device-related trauma (4.5%). Over a third (40%) of all devices reported with adverse events required returning to the operating room for explant or revision. Conclusion The most common complications of DBS systems are infections followed by lead migrations. Further research is needed to minimize infection rates associated with DBS systems and to reduce intrinsic device malfunctions for patients in the future.
