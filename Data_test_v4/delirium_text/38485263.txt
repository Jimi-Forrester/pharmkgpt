38485263|t|Erector spinae plane block (ESPB) for intractable, non-surgical abdominal pain: a scoping review.
38485263|a|Abdominal pain is one of the most common presenting chief complaints in the emergency department (ED). Erector spinae plane block (ESPB) is an ultrasound-guided nerve block with proven effectiveness in treating visceral and somatic abdominal pain. Despite the increasing popularity of ESPB, its role in the management of non-surgical abdominal pain has not yet been characterized. Our scoping review aims to review the current literature on the safety and efficacy of ESPB in the management of patients experiencing intractable, non-surgical abdominal pain. We searched PubMed and Scopus to evaluate the existing literature on ESPB for non-surgical abdominal pain. Reviewers screened 30 titles and abstracts that met the predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Following initial screening, 24 articles underwent full-text review. Two reviewers also screened references included in each study. A total of 14 journal articles were reviewed, including 12 case-based studies, one systematic review, and one narrative review of ESPB in the treatment of non-surgical abdominal pain. All cases described the successful use of ESPB in treating abdominal pain refractory to oral or intravenous analgesic medications, and each case reported no complications. This scoping review provides support for ESPB in the management of intractable, non-surgical abdominal pain. ESPB demonstrates efficacy in alleviating various conditions such as functional abdominal pain, renal colic, pancreatitis, herpetic pain, and cancer-related pain. Theoretical risks such as pneumothorax, bleeding, and infection are possible, although the studies reviewed did not report such complications.
