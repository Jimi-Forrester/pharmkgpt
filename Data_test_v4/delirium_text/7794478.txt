7794478|a|The pathologic diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) rests upon the identification of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) in brain tissue. Methods for staining these structures vary in their sensitivity. Six different silver stains and immunocytochemistry for the beta-amyloid (A beta) peptide were compared for sensitivity in staining of plaques and tangles. For staining of plaques, the silver stains fell into two groups: one group stained primarily large, distorted neurites in classic plaques, and the other stained primarily fine, filamentous elements in diffuse plaques and at the periphery of classic plaques. Our recently developed "quick silver" method demonstrated the highest number of plaques. Sensitivity of NFT staining also varied considerably. The quick silver and Yamamoto-Hirano methods were best for staining both plaques and NFT.
