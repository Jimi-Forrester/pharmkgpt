39522802|t|Protein tau phosphorylation in the proline rich region and its implication in the progression of Alzheimer's disease.
39522802|a|Tau has a wide variety of essential functions in the brain, but this protein also plays a determining role in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative diseases called tauopathies. This is due to its abnormal aggregation and the subsequent formation of neurofibrillary tangles. Tau hyperphosphorylation appears to be a critical step in its transformation into an aggregated protein. However, the exact process, including the cellular events that trigger it, remains unclear. In this study, we employed immunocytochemistry assays on hippocampal sections from AD cases and from tauopathy cases (Braak stage III) with no evidence of cognitive decline, and the P301S mouse model to investigate the colocalization patterns of Tau phosphorylated (p) at specific residues (S202-T205, S214, and T231) within the proline-rich region. Our results show pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus of P301S mice in which Tau is intensely phosphorylated at residues S202 and T205 (recognized by the AT8 antibody), but with no detectable phosphorylation at S214 or T231. These non-colocalizing neurons displayed intensely labeled aggregated pTau deposits distributed through the soma and dendritic processes. However, most of the hippocampal pyramidal neurons are labeled with pTauS214 or pTauT231 antibodies and typically showed a homogeneous and diffuse pTau distribution (not aggregated). This different labeling likely reflects a Tau conformational step, potentially related to the transition from a diffuse tau phosphorylation phenotype (Type 2) into an NFT-like or Type 1 phenotype. We further observed that dendrites of CA3 pyramidal cells are intensely labeled with pTau214 in the stratum lucidum, but not with AT8 or pTauT231. By contrast, analysis of tissue from AD patients or other human tauopathy cases (Braak stage III) with no evidence of cognitive decline revealed extensive colocalization with both antibody combinations in CA1. The complete or mature tangle development may follow a different mechanism in the P301S mouse model or may require more time to achieve the maturity state found in AD cases. Further studies would be necessary to address this question.
