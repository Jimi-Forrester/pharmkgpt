38012459|a|Recently, a global outbreak of COVID-19 has rapidly spread to various national regions. As the number of COVID-19 patients has increased, some of those infected with SARS-CoV-2 have developed a variety of psychiatric symptoms, including depression, cognitive impairment, and fatigue. A distinct storm of inflammatory factors that contribute to the initial disease but also a persistent post-acute phase syndrome has been reported in patients with COVID-19. Neuropsychological symptoms including depression, cognitive impairment, and fatigue are closely related to circulating and local (brain) inflammatory factors. Natural products are currently being examined for their ability to treat numerous complications caused by COVID-19. Among them, ginseng has anti-inflammatory, immune system stimulating, neuroendocrine modulating, and other effects, which may help improve psychiatric symptoms. This review summarizes the basic mechanisms of COVID-19 pneumonia, psychiatric symptoms following coronavirus infections, effects of ginseng on depression, restlessness, and other psychiatric symptoms associated with post-COVID syn-dromes, as well as possible mechanisms underlying these effects.
