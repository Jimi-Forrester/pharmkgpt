37607528|t|Evaluating the Clinical Significance of Diazepam Binding Inhibitor in Alzheimer's Disease: A Comparison with Inflammatory, Oxidative, and Neurodegenerative Biomarkers.
37607528|a|INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the pathologies that the scientific world is still desperate for. The aim of this study was the investigation of diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI) as a prognostic factor for AD prognosis. METHODS: A total of 120 participants were divided into 3 groups. Forty new diagnosed Alzheimer patients (NDG) who have been diagnosed but have not started AD treatment, 40 patients who diagnosed 5 years ago (D5YG), and 40 healthy control groups (CG) were included in the study. Levels of DBI, oxidative stress, inflammatory, and neurodegenerative biomarkers were compared between 3 groups. RESULTS: Plasma levels of DBI, oligomeric Abeta, total tau, glial fibrillary acidic protein, alpha-synuclein, interleukin (IL) 1beta, IL6, tumor necrosis factor alpha, oxidative stress index, high-sensitive C-reactive protein, and DNA damage were found higher in D5YG and NDG as compared to CG (p < 0.001). On the contrary, plasma levels of total thiol, native thiol, vitamin D and vitamin B12 were lower in D5YG and NDG as compared to CG (p < 0.001). DISCUSSION: DBI may be a potential plasma biomarker and promising drug target for AD. It could help physicians make a comprehensive evaluation with cognitive and neurodegenerative tests.
