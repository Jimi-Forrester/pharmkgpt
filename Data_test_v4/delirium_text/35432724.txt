This study was aimed at exploring molecular signatures and mechanistic pathways to improve the diagnosis and treatment of AD. Methods: Microarray datasets were collected to filter differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between AD and nondementia controls. Weight gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) was employed to analyze the correlation of coexpression modules with AD phenotype. A global regulatory network was established and then visualized using Cytoscape software to determine hub genes and their mechanistic pathways. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was conducted to estimate the diagnostic performance of hub genes in AD prediction. Results: A total of 2,163 DEGs from 13,049 background genes were screened in AD relative to nondementia controls. Among the six coexpression modules constructed by WGCNA, DEGs of the key modules with the strongest correlation with AD were extracted to build a global regulatory network. According to the Maximal Clique Centrality (MCC) method, five hub genes associated with mitochondrial complexes were chosen. Further pathway enrichment analysis of hub genes, such as oxidative phosphorylation and retrograde endocannabinoid signaling, was identified. According to the area under the curve (AUC) of about 70%, each hub gene exhibited a good diagnostic performance in predicting AD. Conclusions: Our findings highlight the perturbation of mitochondrial complexes underlying AD onset, which is mediated by molecular signatures involved in oxidative phosphorylation (COX5A, NDUFAB1, SDHB, UQCRC2, and UQCRFS1) and retrograde endocannabinoid signaling (NDUFAB1) pathways.
