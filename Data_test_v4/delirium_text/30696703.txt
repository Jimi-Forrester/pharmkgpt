30696703|t|Acyl-CoA: cholesterol acyltransferases-2 gene polymorphism is associated with increased susceptibility to coronary artery disease in Uygur population in Xinjiang, China.
30696703|a|BACKGROUND: Acyl-CoA: cholesterol acyltransferases (ACAT) is the only enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of cholesterol esters (CE) from free cholesterol and long-chain fatty acyl-CoA and plays a critical role in cellular cholesterol homeostasis. In the present study, our primary objective was to explore whether the single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ACAT-2 gene were associated with coronary artery disease (CAD) in Uygur subjects, in Xinjiang, China. METHODS: We designed a case-control study including 516 CAD patients and 318 age- and sex-matched control subjects. Using the improved multiplex ligation detection reaction (iMLDR) method, we genotyped two SNPs (rs28765985 and rs7308390) of ACAT-2 gene in all subjects. RESULTS: We found that the genotypes, the dominant model (CC + CT vs TT) and over-dominant model (CT vs CC + TT) of rs28765985 were significantly different between CAD patients and the controls (P=0.027, P=0.012 and P=0.035, respectively). The rs28765985 C allele was associated with a significantly elevated CAD risk [CC/CT vs TT: odds ratio (OR) = 1.48, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.02-2.16, P=0.04] after adjustment for confounders. The TC and LDL-C levels were significantly higher in rs28765985 CC/CT genotypes than that in TT genotypes (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Rs28765985 of ACAT-2 gene are associated with CAD in Uygur subjects. Subjects with CC/CT genotype or C allele of rs28765985 were associated with an increased risk of CAD.
