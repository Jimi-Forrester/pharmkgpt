26471241|t|Calcineurin B stimulates cytokine production through a CD14-independent Toll-like receptor 4 pathway.
26471241|a|The calcineurin B subunit (CnB) is the regulatory subunit of Cn, a Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine protein phosphatase. In this study, we demonstrate that extracellular CnB was effectively internalized through a CD14-independent Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) pathway, which led to the phosphorylation of nuclear factor (NF)-kappa-B inhibitor alpha (IkappaB-alpha) and upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines in human monocytes. CnB-induced IkappaB-alpha phosphorylation is completely dependent on TNF receptor-associated factor 3 (TRAF3) but not TRAF6, which is indispensable for IkappaB-alpha phosphorylation in response to lipopolysaccharide. The loss-of-function CnB mutants were able to induce IkappaB-alpha phosphorylation, further indicating that this novel role of CnB is completely independent of the phosphatase function of Cn. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that CnB is a novel host-derived immunostimulatory factor, having a role as an agonist in monocytes, and specificity in TLR4 signaling through TRAF3 and TRAF6, in response to various agonists.
