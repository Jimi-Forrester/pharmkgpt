16078972|a|The claim that aging itself is treatable or even preventable has repeatedly been made over the centuries. Antiaging medicine is the current leader of approaches that even claim that geriatrics as a discipline will become increasingly unnecessary. The concept of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) as a condition intermediate between normal cognitive aging and Alzheimer's disease highlights the conceptual and practical difficulty of differentiating aging from disease. What should geriatricians and their organizations make of scientifically mainstream attempts to decelerate, arrest, or compress aspects of the normal human aging, including the brain aging process? This article reviews the political, philosophical, practice-related, and economical implications of antiaging medicine for geriatrics using MCI as a practical example. It concludes by suggesting actions that geriatricians should consider to strengthen their profession and to improve patient care in response to the challenges of longevity medicine.
