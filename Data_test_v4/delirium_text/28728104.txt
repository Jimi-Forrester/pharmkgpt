28728104|t|Design, synthesis and evaluation of coumarin-pargyline hybrids as novel dual inhibitors of monoamine oxidases and amyloid-beta aggregation for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
28728104|a|A series of coumarin-pargyline hybrids (4a-x) have been designed, synthesized and evaluated as novel dual inhibitors of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Most of the compounds exhibited a potent ability to inhibit amyloid-beta (Abeta) aggregation and monoamine oxidases. In particular, compound 4x exhibited remarkable inhibitory activities against monoamine oxidases (IC50, 0.027 +- 0.004 muM for MAO-B; 3.275 +- 0.040 muM for MAO-A) and Abeta1-42 aggregation (54.0 +- 1.1%, 25 muM). Moreover, compound 4x showed low toxicity according to in vitro cell toxicity test. The results of the parallel artificial membrane permeability assay for blood-brain barrier indicated that compound 4x would be potent to cross the blood-brain barrier. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that compound 4x was an effective and promising candidate for AD therapy.
