39064085|t|Evaluation of Outcomes in Patients with Previous Stroke History following Cardiac Surgery: A Single-Center Study.
39064085|a|Background: The aim of the study to analyze the risk of complications, including neurological sequelae, alongside early and late mortality among patients with antecedent stroke subjected to cardiac surgical interventions with extracorporeal support. Material and methods: A single-center retrospective study was conducted on 10,685 patients who underwent cardiac surgery with extracorporeal circulation at the Department of Cardiac Surgery. The first group comprised all patients eligible for cardiac surgery with extracorporeal circulation. The second group consisted of patients with a preoperative history of stroke. Results: In the study, a statistically significant association was observed between preoperative stroke and the occurrence of postoperative pneumonia (OR = 1.482, p = 0.006), respiratory failure (OR = 1.497, p = 0.006), renal failure (OR = 1.391, p = 0.019), 30-day mortality (OR = 1.528, p = 0.026), 90-day mortality (OR = 1.658, p < 0.001), and one-year mortality (OR = 1.706, p < 0.001). Conclusions: Patients with a history of preoperative stroke more frequently experienced renal failure and respiratory-system complications such as pneumonia and respiratory failure. The survival time of patients with a history of preoperative stroke was shorter compared to that of the control group during the analyzed 30-day, 90-day, and one-year observation periods.
