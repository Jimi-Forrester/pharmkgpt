37612409|a|Mitochondria, ubiquitous double-membrane-bound organelles, regulate energy production, support cellular activities, harbor metabolic pathways, and, paradoxically, mediate cell fate. Evidence has shown mitochondria as points of convergence for diverse cell death-inducing pathways that trigger the various mechanisms underlying apoptotic and nonapoptotic programmed cell death. Thus, dysfunctional cellular pathways eventually lead or contribute to various age-related diseases, such as neurodegenerative, cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Thus, mitochondrion-associated programmed cell death-based treatments show great therapeutic potential, providing novel insights in clinical trials. This review discusses mitochondrial quality control networks with activity triggered by stimuli and that maintain cellular homeostasis via mitohormesis, the mitochondrial unfolded protein response, and mitophagy. The review also presents details on various forms of mitochondria-associated programmed cell death, including apoptosis, necroptosis, ferroptosis, pyroptosis, parthanatos, and paraptosis, and highlights their involvement in age-related disease pathogenesis, collectively suggesting therapeutic directions for further research.
