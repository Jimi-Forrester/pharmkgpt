38882989|t|Comparison of the Incidence of Post-intensive Care Syndrome (PICS) Between Elderly and Non-elderly Patients: A Subgroup Analysis of the Japan-PICS Study.
38882989|a|AIM: The aging society is expanding, and more elderly patients are admitted to intensive care units (ICUs). Elderly patients may have increased ICU mortality and are thought to have a high incidence of post-intensive care syndrome (PICS). There are few studies of PICS in the elderly. This study hypothesized that the elderly have an increased incidence of PICS compared to the non-elderly. METHODS: This is a subgroup analysis of a previous multicenter prospective observational study (Prevalence of post-intensive care syndrome among Japanese intensive care unit patients: The Japan-PICS study) conducted from April 2019 to September 2019. Ninety-six patients were included who were over 18 years old, admitted to the ICU, and expected to require mechanical ventilation for more than 48 hours. Physical component scales (PCS), mental component scales (MCS), and Short-Memory Questionnaire (SMQ) scores of included patients were compared before admission to the ICU and six months later. The diagnosis of PICS required one of the following: (1) the PCS score decreased  10 points, (2) the MCS score decreased  10 points, or (3) the SMQ score decreased by >40 points. Patients were classified as non-elderly (<65 years old) or elderly ( 65 years old), and the incidence of PICS was compared between these two groups. RESULTS: The non-elderly (N=27) and elderly (N=69) groups had incidences of PICS: 67% and 62% (p=0.69), respectively. CONCLUSION: There is no statistically significant difference in the incidence of PICS in the non-elderly and elderly.
