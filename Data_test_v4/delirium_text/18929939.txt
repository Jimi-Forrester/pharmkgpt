18929939|t|Delirium in the acute care setting: characteristics, diagnosis and treatment.
18929939|a|Delirium is a neurobehavioral syndrome caused by the transient disruption of normal neuronal activity secondary to systemic disturbances. It is also the most common psychiatric syndrome found in the general hospital setting, its prevalence surpassing better known psychiatric disorders. This article reviews the published literature on delirium and addresses the epidemiology, known etiologic factors, presentation and characteristics of delirium, while emphasizing what is known about treatment strategies and prevention. Given increasing evidence that delirium is not always reversible and the many sequelae associated with its development, physicians must do everything possible to prevent its occurrence or shorten its duration, by recognizing its symptoms early, correcting underlying contributing causes, and using treatment strategies proven to help recover functional status.
