38180956|a|BACKGROUND: Sarcopenia is a risk factor for pneumonia in the elderly, and the timed up-and-go test (TUG) can be used as a screening tool for sarcopenia in this population. This study aimed to evaluate the association between TUG test results and future pneumonia or ventilator care. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From the National Health Insurance Service-Senior Cohort database, we identified 19,804 people without neurological diseases who underwent the TUG test in the National Screening Program for Transitional Ages at the age of 66 years during 2007-2008. Gait abnormality was defined as taking 10 s or longer to perform the TUG test. Pneumonia occurrence was defined using the International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision (ICD-10) code for pneumonia (J12-J18, J69), and ventilator care was defined by procedure codes (M5830, M5850, M5867, M5858, M5860, M5859) according to the Healthcare Common Procedure Coding system codes from 2007 to 2015. RESULTS: The mean follow-up period was 7.4 years (standard error, SE 0.02). The incidence rates of pneumonia in the normal and slow TUG groups were 38 and 39.5/1000 person-years, respectively. The slow TUG group did not show a higher risk of pneumonia (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.042; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.988-1.107]). Regarding ventilator care, the incidence was 4.7 and 5.2 cases per 1,000 person-years in the normal and slow TUG groups, respectively. Slow TUG groups also did not show an increased risk of ventilator occurrence (aHR, 1.136, [95% CI = 0.947-1.363]). CONCLUSION: The TUG test result was not associated with future pneumonia or ventilator care and may not be useful for predicting pneumonia in community-dwelling elderly individuals. Further studies are needed to identify additional functional tools for sarcopenia associated with future pneumonia occurrences.
