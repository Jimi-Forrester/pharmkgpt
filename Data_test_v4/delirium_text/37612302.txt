37612302|a|Mortality from non cancer causes in patients with gallbladder cancer (GBC) still unclear. This study evaluated the causes and risk factors of non cancer death during different follow-up periods after GBC diagnosis. Non cancer causes of death for GBC patients diagnosed between 2000 and 2017 in Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database were analyzed and standardized mortality rates (SMR) for each non cancer death were calculated. Predictors for non cancer death were identified through multivariate competing risk analysis. A total 11,927 GBC patients were identified for further analysis, 9393 died during follow up. The largest proportion of non cancer deaths occurred > 3 years after diagnosis (39.4%). Most common non cancer cause were cardiovascular disease (43.3%), followed by other cause of death (34.4%) and infectious diseases (8.6%). Compared with US general population, GBC patients has higher risk of death from disease of heart (SMR, 1.58; 95%CI, 1.41-1.75), septicemia (SMR,3.21; 95%CI, 2.27-4.40), diabetes mellitus (SMR,1.97; 95%CI, 1.43-2.63), alone with other causes. Non cancer causes accounted for a significant proportion of deaths during the follow-up period after GBC diagnosis. The risk of non cancer death is higher in GBC patients than in the general population. Our study provides comprehensive assessment of death from non cancer cause in GBC patients, which has important implications for health management in GBC patients.
