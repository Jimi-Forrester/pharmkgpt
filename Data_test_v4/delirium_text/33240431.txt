33240431|a|Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common types of human cancer. However, there is still an urgent need to identify novel treatment strategies for CRC. The present study aimed to validate the potential antitumor effects of polyphyllin VII in CRC. The present study revealed that polyphyllin VII could significantly inhibit CRC proliferation and induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Moreover, the anti-metastatic effect of polyphyllin VII in CRC cells was implicated. Microarray analysis identified that polyphyllin VII could affect multiple protein coding genes and non-coding RNAs. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that polyphyllin VII regulated multiple pathways in CRC, including 'ER to Golgi vesicle-mediated transport', 'response to cAMP', 'Ras protein signal transduction', 'metabolic pathways', 'MAPK signaling pathway' and 'cell cycle'. Protein-Protein Interaction network analysis identified a series of key polyphyllin VII-regulating genes in CRC, including ribonucleoside-diphosphate reductase subunit M2, structural maintenance of chromosomes protein 4 and DNA replication licensing factor MCM4. Finally, the present results demonstrated that these key polyphyllin VII-regulating genes were dysregulated in CRC. Taken together, these results indicated that polyphyllin VII could be a novel antitumor drug for the treatment of CRC.
