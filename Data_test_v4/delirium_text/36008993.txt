36008993|t|Plasma P-Tau181 for the Discrimination of Alzheimer's Disease from Other Primary Dementing and/or Movement Disorders.
36008993|a|Blood phospho-tau181 may offer a useful biomarker for Alzheimer's disease. However, the use of either serum or plasma phospho-tau181 and their diagnostic value are currently under intense investigation. In a pilot study, we measured both serum and plasma phospho-tau181 (pT181-Tau) by single molecule array (Simoa) in a group of patients with Alzheimer's disease and a mixed group of patients with other primary dementing and/or movement disorders. Classical cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers were also measured. Plasma (but not serum) pT181-Tau showed a significant increase in Alzheimer's disease and correlated significantly with cerebrospinal fluid amyloid and pT181-Tau. Receiver operating curve analysis revealed a significant discrimination of Alzheimer's from non-Alzheimer's disease patients, with an area under the curve of 0.83 and an excellent sensitivity but a moderate specificity. Plasma pT181-Tau is not an established diagnostic biomarker for Alzheimer's disease, but it could become one in the future, or it may serve as a screening tool for specific cases of patients or presymptomatic subjects.
