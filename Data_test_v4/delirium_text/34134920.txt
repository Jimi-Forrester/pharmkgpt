34134920|a|BACKGROUND: The ongoing outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), as the latest threat to global health, causes overwhelming effects for the public healthcare systems worldwide. Of note, in addition to the respiratory complications, some patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) also develop serious cardiovascular injuries. Vasoactive peptides play an important role in a wide range of physiological and pathological conditions. AIM: With the urgent need for exploring the specific therapeutic targets and biomarkers for the emerging COVID-19, the general aim of this review is to discuss the potentials of the vasoactive peptides including Angiotensin II (Ang II), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), endothelin-1 (ET-1), calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), natriuretic peptides, substance P (SP) and bradykinin (BK) as therapeutic targets and/or prognostic indicators for the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: Based on various observations some authors conclude that the assessment of vasoactive peptides shall be considered a routine part of COVID-19 patient monitoring, and they can serve as potential therapeutic targets for the disease management.
