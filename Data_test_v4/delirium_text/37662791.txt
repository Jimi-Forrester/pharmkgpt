37662791|a|Organophosphorus Pesticides (OPPs) are among the extensively used pesticides throughout the world to boost agricultural production. However, persistent residues of these toxic pesticides in various vegetables, fruits, and drinking water poses detrimental health effects. Consequently, the rapid monitoring of these harmful chemicals through simple and cost-effective methods has become crucial. In such an instance, electrochemical methods offer simple, rapid, sensitive, reproducible, and affordable detection pathways. To overcome the limitations associated with electrochemical enzymatic sensors, non-enzymatic sensors have emerged as promising and simpler alternatives. The non-enzymatic sensors have demonstrated superior activity, reaching detection limit up to femto (10-15) molar concentration in recent years, leveraging higher selectivity obtained through the molecularly imprinted polymers, synergistic effects between carbonaceous nanomaterials and metals, metal oxide alloys, and other alternative approaches. Herein, this review paper provides an overview of the recent advancements in the development of non-enzymatic electrochemical sensors for the detection of commonly used OPPs, such as Chlorpyrifos (CHL), Diazinon (DZN), Malathion (MTN), Methyl parathion (MP) and Fenthion (FEN). The design method of the electrodes, electrode functioning mechanism, and their analytical performance metrics, such as limit of detection, sensitivity, selectivity, and linearity range, were reviewed and compared. Furthermore, the existing challenges within this rapidly growing field were discussed along with their potential solutions which will facilitate the fabrication of advanced and sustainable non-enzymatic sensors in the future.
