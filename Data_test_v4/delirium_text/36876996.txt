36876996|t|Anxiety in children: A review on how to address it in the perioperative setting post-pandemic.
36876996|a|In this paper, we review the psychological burden of SARS-CoV-2 on children and how health care workers can play a role in mitigating its mental health impact during anesthetic procedures. We evaluate the societal changes that have affected children over 2 years of the pandemic and the subsequent soaring rates of anxiety and depression reported. Unfortunately, the perioperative setting is a stressful experience at baseline and the addition of COVID-19 has only exacerbated the situation. Anxiety and depression are often linked to maladaptive behavior post-surgery, including increased rates of emergence delirium. Providers can utilize techniques based on developmental milestones, Certified Child Life Specialists, parental presence during induction, and medications to reduce anxiety. As health care workers, we need to recognize and address these concerns as untreated mental health issues can leave long-term consequences for children.
