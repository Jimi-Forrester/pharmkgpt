32013408|t|High-Efficiency Fluorescence through Bioinspired Supramolecular Self-Assembly.
32013408|a|Peptide self-assembly has attracted extensive interest in the field of eco-friendly optoelectronics and bioimaging due to its inherent biocompatibility, intrinsic fluorescence, and flexible modulation. However, the practical application of such materials was hindered by the relatively low quantum yield of such assemblies. Here, inspired by the molecular structure of BFPms1, we explored the "self-assembly locking strategy" to design and manipulate the assembly of metal-stabilized cyclic(l-histidine-d-histidine) into peptide material with the high-fluorescence efficiency. We used this bioorganic material as an emissive layer in photo- and electroluminescent prototypes, demonstrating the feasibility of utilizing self-assembling peptides to fabricate a biointegrated microchip that incorporates eco-friendly and tailored optoelectronic properties. We further employed a "self-encapsulation" strategy for constructing an advanced nanocarrier with integrated in situ monitoring. The strategy of the supramolecular capture of functional components exemplifies the use of bioinspired organic chemistry to provide frontiers of smart materials, potentially allowing a better interface between sustainable optoelectronics and biomedical applications.
