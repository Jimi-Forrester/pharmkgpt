16317256|t|Clinical features of frontotemporal dementia.
16317256|a|What was once called Pick's disease has three major anatomic variants. With all three, frontotemporal brain is selectively injured whereas posterior cortical regions are spared. These three clinical patterns include a bifrontal, slightly asymmetric subtype with more involvement of the right frontotemporal region called frontotemporal dementia or the frontal variant of FTD (fvFTD), a temporal-predominant subtype called the temporal variant of FTD or semantic dementia (SD), and a left frontal-predominant subtype called progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA). The three anatomic groups help to classify distinctive clinical syndromes with unique features. Careful study of these subtypes of frontotemporal dementia, using combinations of new quantitative neuroimaging, behavioral and physiological measures are yielding important information about the functioning of the brain's frontal and temporal regions. As we come to better understand the biologic basis for the three FTD clinical syndromes, new classification schemas may emerge, but our current clinical criteria serve as a strong guide to the diagnosis and separation of FTD from Alzheimer disease and other dementias.
