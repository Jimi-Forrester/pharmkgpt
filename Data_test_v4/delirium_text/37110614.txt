37110614|t|Canthin-6-Ones: Potential Drugs for Chronic Inflammatory Diseases by Targeting Multiple Inflammatory Mediators.
37110614|a|Chronic inflammatory disease (CID) is a category of medical conditions that causes recurrent inflammatory attacks in multiple tissues. The occurrence of CID is related to inappropriate immune responses to normal tissue substances and invading microbes due to many factors, such as defects in the immune system and imbalanced regulation of commensal microbes. Thus, effectively keeping the immune-associated cells and their products in check and inhibiting aberrant activation of the immune system is a key strategy for the management of CID. Canthin-6-ones are a subclass of beta-carboline alkaloids isolated from a wide range of species. Several emerging studies based on in vitro and in vivo experiments reveal that canthin-6-ones may have potential therapeutic effects on many inflammatory diseases. However, no study has yet summarized the anti-inflammatory functions and the underlying mechanisms of this class of compounds. This review provides an overview of these studies, focusing on the disease entities and the inflammatory mediators that have been shown to be affected by canthin-6-ones. In particular, the major signaling pathways affected by canthin-6-ones, such as the NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome and the NF-kappaB signaling pathway, and their roles in several CIDs are discussed. Moreover, we discuss the limitations in studies of canthin-6-ones and provide possible solutions. In addition, a perspective that may suggest possible future research directions is provided. This work may be helpful for further mechanistic studies and possible therapeutic applications of canthin-6-ones in the treatment of CID.
