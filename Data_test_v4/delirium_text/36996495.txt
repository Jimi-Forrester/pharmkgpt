36996495|t|Identification and validation of anoikis-associated gene SNCG as a prognostic biomarker in gastric cancer.
36996495|a|Anoikis is a newly discovered form of apoptosis that was originally identified in the extracellular matrix (ECM). Recent studies have reported that anoikis is central to cancer metastasis. Here, SNCG was identified as hub anoikis-associated gene in GC and associated with prognosis of patients with GC. To screen the hub anoikis-associated genes connected to GC, the database of Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) was employed. For further validating these identified genes, the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) dataset was applied, and Western blotting and quantitative Real-Time PCR were carried out. To identify hub genes, we conducted the analyses of univariate Cox regression, differential expression, and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). According to the identified hub genes, we constructed a model of prognosis. Following complex analysis, SNCG was finally identified as hub anoikis-associated gene in GC. Indeed, K-M and receiver operating characteristic analyses suggested that the expression patterns of SNCG can be used as prognostic factors for GC survival. The expression and survival trends of SNCG were verified in the validation cohort and in vitro experimental analyses. The analysis of immune cell infiltration showed that the infiltrated immune cells varied among patients with GC and gene SNCG. Furthermore, due to the significant association of the constructed risk signature with patient age and survival, this risk signature can be used to predict the prognosis of GC. We suggest that SNCG was served as hub anoikis-associated gene in GC. Meanwhile, SNCG may have prognostic potential for overall patient survival.
