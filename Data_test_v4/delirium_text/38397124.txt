38397124|t|Non-Targeted Metabolomics Investigation of a Sub-Chronic Variable Stress Model Unveils Sex-Dependent Metabolic Differences Induced by Stress.
38397124|a|Depression is twice as prevalent in women as in men, however, most preclinical studies of depression have used male rodent models. This study aimed to examine how stress affects metabolic profiles depending on sex using a rodent depression model: sub-chronic variable stress (SCVS). The SCVS model of male and female mice was established in discovery and validation sets. The stress-induced behavioral phenotypic changes were similar in both sexes, however, the metabolic profiles of female plasma and brain became substantially different after stress, whereas those of males did not. Four stress-differential plasma metabolites-beta-hydroxybutyric acid (BHB), L-serine, glycerol, and myo-inositol-could yield biomarker panels with excellent performance to discern the stressed individuals only for females. Disturbances in BHB, glucose, 1,5-anhydrosorbitol, lactic acid, and several fatty acids in the plasma of stressed females implied a systemic metabolic shift to beta-oxidation in females. The plasma levels of BHB and corticosterone only in stressed females were observed not only in SCVS but also in an acute stress model. These results collectively suggest a sex difference in the metabolic responses by stress, possibly involving the energy metabolism shift to beta-oxidation and the HPA axis dysregulation in females.
