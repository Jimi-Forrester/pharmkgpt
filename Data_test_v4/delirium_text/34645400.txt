34645400|t|The effects of preoperative alcohol, tobacco, and psychological stress on postoperative complications: a prospective observational study.
34645400|a|BACKGROUND: Postoperative complications occur frequently, despite progress in anesthetic pharmacology and surgical techniques. Although habits, such as alcohol and tobacco use, and mental health have been studied individually as modifying factors, few studies have examined the relationship between multiple lifestyle choices and postoperative complications in patients undergoing surgery. Hence, this study aimed to investigate the associations between unhealthy lifestyle choices and postoperative complications. METHODS: We included 730 patients who underwent surgery in our department between March 2015 and April 2016. Participants completed preoperative questionnaires, including the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test, Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence, and tests for psychological stress (6-item Kessler Psychological Distress Scale; Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale). Multivariable logistic analysis was used to analyze the association of preoperative drug dependence and psychological stress with postoperative complications. RESULTS: Of the 721 cases analyzed, 461 (64%) were women. The median age of patients was 62 years (interquartile range: 48-71). At the time of surgical decision-making, 429 out of 710 respondents (60%) had a drinking habit, and 144 out of 693 respondents (21%) had a smoking habit during the preceding year. Seventy-nine patients had developed complications. Multivariable analysis revealed that old age (p = 0.020), psychological stress (p = 0.041), and longer anesthesia time (p < 0.001) were significantly associated with postoperative complications. Drinking or smoking variables were not associated with postoperative complications. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative psychological stress, as evaluated with the 6-item Kessler Psychological Distress Scale, is associated with the risk of postoperative complications.
