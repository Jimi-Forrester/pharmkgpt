34436056|t|An Electrochemical Evaluation of Novel Ferrocene Derivatives for Glutamate and Liver Biomarker Biosensing.
34436056|a|Here, we present an evaluation of two new monosubstituted ferrocene (Fc) derivatives, 3-(1H-pyrrol-1-yl)propanamidoferrocene and 1-hydroxy-2-[2-(thiophen-3-yl)-ethylamino]ethylferrocene, as glutamate oxidase mediators, together with their preparation and characterisation. Taking into consideration the influence of the electronic effects of substituents on the redox potentials of the Fc species, two candidates with pyrrole or thiophene moieties were proposed for investigation. Film studies involved potential sweeping in the presence of pyrrole or 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene monomers resulting in stable electroactive films with % signal loss upon cycling ranging from 1 to 7.82% and surface coverage (Gamma) 0.47-1.15 x 10-9 mol/cm2 for films formed under optimal conditions. Construction of a glutamate oxidase modified electrode resulted in second-generation biosensing with the aid of both cyclic voltammetry and hydrodynamic amperometry, resulting in glutamate sensitivity of 0.86-1.28 muA/mM and Km&nbsp;(app) values over the range 3.67-5.01 mM. A follow-up enzyme assay for liver biomarker gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase realised unmediated and mediated measurement establishing reaction and incubation time investigations and a realising response over <100 U/L gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase with a sensitivity of 5 nA/UL-1.
