26260291|a|Pentacyclic triterpenic compounds including asiatic, betulinic, maslinic, oleanolic and ursolic acid occur naturally in many herbs and plant foods. It is well known that these triterpenoids possess anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory activities. Furthermore, recent in vitro and in vivo researches indicated that these compounds could inhibit the production of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs). The impact of these triterpenes upon the activity and protein expression of enzymes involved in polyol pathway including aldose reductase and sorbitol dehydrogenase has been examined, and positive results are reported. These studies suggest that certain triterpenes are potent anti-glycative agents, and may benefit the prevention and/or therapy of glycation-related diseases such as diabetes mellitus and Alzheimer's disease. In this review article, the anti-glycative activity and action mode of certain triterpenes are highlighted. These information may promote the anti-glycative application of these natural compounds.
