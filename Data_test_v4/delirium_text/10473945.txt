10473945|t|Delirium in clinical practice: experiences from a specialized delirium ward.
10473945|a|Geriatric patients with known dementia and suffering from an acute somatic disease are highly vulnerable to develop delirium. It is therefore essential to suspect and recognize delirium in these patients, especially in emergency wards. In the present study we evaluated activities on a dedicated delirium ward at a Swedish University Hospital. Over one and a half years 637 patients were treated for suspected delirium, the majority of patients being referred from the emergency ward at the same hospital. Infectious diseases were the main cause of delirium in 67% of cases. Other common causes were heart disease and stroke. Drug use as the only cause of delirium was found in less than 1% of cases. Approximately 70% of patients had cognitive disturbances, either dementia or mild cognitive impairment. The existence of multiple diseases as causative factors was frequent. Knowledge about delirium and how it is both diagnosed and treated is of great importance in all kinds of settings where acute somatic treatments are common.
