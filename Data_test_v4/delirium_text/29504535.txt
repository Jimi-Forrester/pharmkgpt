29504535|t|Crosstalk between Peripheral Small Vessel Properties and Anxious-like Profiles: Sex, Genotype, and Interaction Effects in Mice with Normal Aging and 3xTg-AD mice at Advanced Stages of Disease.
29504535|a|Cardiovascular disease resulting from oxidative stress and inflammation can exacerbate Alzheimer's disease. This brief report provides the first evidence of compromised small peripheral mesenteric resistance artery (MRA) properties in 15-month-old 3xTg-AD mice. Females showed worse physiologically relevant MRA structural (increased passive external and internal diameters, cross sectional area) and functional (increased active internal diameters) alterations suggesting sex-dependent dysfunctions. At both physiological and high intraluminal pressures, vascular alterations correlated with the anxious-like behavioral profile, in a sex-dependent manner. Finally, the results unveil a crosstalk between peripheral small vessel properties and behavior in both 3xTg-AD mice and age-matched counterparts with normal aging.
