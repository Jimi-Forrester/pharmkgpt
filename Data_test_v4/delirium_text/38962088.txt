38962088|t|Effect of near-infrared spectroscopy on postoperative delirium in cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
38962088|a|Background: Postoperative delirium (POD) is a common anesthetic side effect in cardiac surgery. However, the role of oxygen saturation monitoring in reducing postoperative delirium has been controversial. Therefore, this meta-analysis aimed to analyze whether NIRS monitoring during cardiac surgery under cardiopulmonary bypass could reduce the incidence of postoperative delirium. Methods: PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Embase and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) databases were systematically searched using the related keywords for randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) published from their inception to March 16, 2024. This review was conducted by the Preferred Reporting Project and Meta-Analysis Statement (PRISMA) guidelines for systematic review. The primary outcome was postoperative delirium, and the second outcomes included the length of ICU stay, the incidence of kidney-related adverse outcomes, and the incidence of cardiac-related adverse outcomes. Results: The incidence of postoperative delirium could be reduced under the guidance of near-infrared spectroscopy monitoring (OR, 0.657; 95% CI, 0.447-0.965; P = 0.032; I2 = 0%). However, there were no significant differences in the length of ICU stay (SMD, 0.005 days; 95% CI, -0.135-0.146; P = 0.940; I2 = 39.3%), the incidence of kidney-related adverse outcomes (OR, 0.761; 95% CI, 0.386-1.500; P = 0.430; I2 = 0%), and the incidence of the cardiac-related adverse outcomes (OR, 1.165; 95% CI, 0.556-2.442; P = 0.686; I2 = 0%) between the two groups. Conclusion: Near-infrared spectroscopy monitoring in cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass helps reduce postoperative delirium in patients.
