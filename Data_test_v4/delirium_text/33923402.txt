33923402|a|PURPOSE: To elucidate the effects of butyric acid (BA), a metabolite of bacteria involved in periodontitis, and a possible enhancer of the junctional epithelial cells. METHODS: A murine junctional epithelial cell line, JE-1, was used to assess the effects of sodium butyrate (NaB) as BA. Cell proliferation, migration and attachment were analyzed. Additionally, gene and promoter expression analysis was performed, i.e., cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) and gene ontology (GO) term enrichment analysis. RESULTS: NaB affected junctional epithelial cell proliferation, migration and attachment. A high concentration of NaB caused cell death and a low concentration tended to promote migration and adhesion. CAGE analysis revealed 75 upregulated and 96 downregulated genes in the cells after 0.2 mM NaB stimulation for 3 h. Regarding GO term enrichment, the genes upregulated >4-fold participated predominantly in cell migration and proliferation. The results of this study suggest that BA produced from periodontopathic bacteria is involved in periodontal tissue destruction at high concentrations. Furthermore, at low concentrations, BA potentially participates in periodontal disease progression by increasing proliferation, migration and attachment of the junctional epithelium and thereby increasing epithelial down-growth.
