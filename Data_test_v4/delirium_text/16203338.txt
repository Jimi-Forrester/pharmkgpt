16203338|t|Barbiturate withdrawal--a nomogram for supplementary dosing after the phenobarbitone loading technique.
16203338|a|A case of a woman who presented with a multiple drug overdose and then subsequently had a withdrawal syndrome complicated by seizures and delirium highlights the seriousness of the barbiturate withdrawal syndrome. The patient had a short elimination half-life for phenobarbitone and required supplementary phenobarbitone doses to prevent and treat these complications. We have devised a nomogram which in conjunction with serum levels allows a rapid determination of whether and how much supplementary doses are required during barbiturate withdrawal.
