36344743|a|The aim of this study was to describe the levels of depression, anxiety, stress, and distress in patients undergoing cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC). The 21-item Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) and Distress Thermometer were administered preoperatively, postoperatively day 10, and at hospital discharge to 169 patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis undergoing CRS and HIPEC. The mean preoperative values for DASS-21 subscale scores were 4.7 (depression), 4.2 (anxiety), and 8.4 (stress), and the mean preoperative Distress Thermometer rating was 4.0. No significant changes in levels of depression, stress, or distress were noted thereafter. The DASS-21 anxiety subscale score significantly increased at hospital discharge (p = .005). Higher levels of preoperative psychological depression, anxiety, stress and distress were associated with worse mental component scores. Higher preoperative depression levels were associated with the provision of more clinical psychologist occasions of service, and higher preoperative distress levels were associated with younger age. Preoperative psychological measures are important for ensuring CRS and HIPEC patients that require additional support are identified and provided with ongoing psychological interventions.
