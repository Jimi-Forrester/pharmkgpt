34465984|a|PURPOSE: Dyslipidemia is a major cardiovascular risk factor, and its control leads to less cardiovascular events. Many patients will need some medications to achieve ideal targets. Non-adherence to medications is a complex problem with high impact on their effectiveness. This study aims to identify the determinants of non-adherence to medications in patients with dyslipidemia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a systematic review. PubMed and Scopus databases were searched for original articles, published between 2000 and 2020, using the MeSH terms "Dyslipidemias" and "Medication Adherence". RESULTS: From the initial 3502 identified articles, we selected 46 to include in the final qualitative synthesis. The determinants associated with non-adherence were lower age (<=50 years), female sex, African American ethnicity, smoking habits, being a new user of lipid-lowering medications, reporting or having concerns about lipid-lowering medication side effects and some comorbidities (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Alzheimer's disease/dementia, depression and diabetes). On the contrary, adherence is higher in older patients, alcohol drinking habits, taking beta-blockers, having a higher number of comorbidities, having a history of cardiovascular events, cardiac interventions or revascularization procedures, having health insurance and having more provider follow-up visits. CONCLUSION: There are important identifiable determinants of non-adherence in patients with dyslipidemia. These patients benefit from a specific approach to minimize the problem and maximize the potential benefit of the prescription.
