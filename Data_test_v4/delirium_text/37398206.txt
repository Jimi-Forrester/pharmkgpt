37398206|a|Background Although most individuals recover from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) within a few weeks, some people continue to experience a wide range of symptoms known as post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC) or long COVID. Majority of patients with PASC develop neurological disorders like brain fog, fatigue, mood swings, sleep disorders, loss of smell and test among others collectively called neuro-PASC. While the people living with HIV (PWH) do not have a higher risk of developing severe disease and mortality/morbidity due to COVID-19. As a large section of PWH suffered from HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND), it is essential to understand the impact of neuro-PASC on people with HAND. In pursuit of this, we infected HIV/SARS-CoV-2 alone or together in primary human astrocytes and pericytes and performed proteomics to understand the impact of co-infection in the central nervous system. Methods Primary human astrocytes and pericytes were infected with SARS-CoV-2 or HIV or HIV + SARS-CoV-2. The concentration of HIV and SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA in the culture supernatant was quantified using reverse transcriptase quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). This was followed by a quantitative proteomics analysis of mock, HIV, SARS-CoV-2, and HIV + SARS-CoV-2 infected astrocytes and pericytes to understand the impact of the virus in CNS cell types. Results Both healthy and HIV-infected astrocytes and pericytes support abortive/low level of SARS-CoV-2 replication. In both mono-infected and co-infected cells, we observe a modest increase in the expression of SARS-CoV-2 host cell entry factors (ACE2, TMPRSS2, NRP1, and TRIM28) and inflammatory mediators (IL-6, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta and IL-18). Quantitative proteomic analysis has identified uniquely regulated pathways in mock vs SARS-CoV-2, mock vs HIV + SARS-CoV-2, and HIV vs HIV + SARS-CoV-2 infected astrocytes and pericytes. The gene set enrichment analysis revealed that the top ten enriched pathways are linked to several neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Conclusions Our study emphasizes the significance of long-term monitoring of patients co-infected with HIV and SARS-CoV-2 to detect and understand the development of neurological abnormalities. By unraveling the molecular mechanisms involved, we can identify potential targets for future therapeutic interventions.
