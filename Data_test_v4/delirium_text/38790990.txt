38790990|t|Understanding the Patient Landscape: A Ten-Year Retrospective Examination of Electroconvulsive Therapy in Romania's Largest Psychiatric Hospital.
38790990|a|The aim of this analysis was to investigate the socio-demographic and clinical profile, the effectiveness, and the association of pharmacological treatment in patients who underwent electroconvulsive therapy during the last 10 years in the largest psychiatric hospital in Romania. This study includes 249 patients aged between 18 and 73 years old. Recurrent depression was the most frequent diagnosis for which ECT was performed (T = 96, 38.55%), followed by schizophrenia (T = 72, 28.91%). The most frequent indication for ECT was treatment resistance (T = 154, 61.84%), followed by persistent suicidal ideation (T = 54, 21.68%) and catatonia (T = 42, 16.86%). In 111 (44.60%) cases included in this study, re-hospitalization was required after performing ECT, while 138 (55.40%) participants did not require any further hospital readmissions. Significant differences were found between these groups in terms of socio-demographic data, diagnosis, number of ECT sessions performed, and association of psychotropic medication during and after the procedure, therefore two separate patient profiles were found based on these characteristics. Patients necessitating re-hospitalization post-ECT were mainly males aged 25-44 diagnosed with schizophrenia and underwent a greater number of ECT sessions (7-12), whereas those not requiring re-hospitalization were predominantly females aged 45-64 with recurrent depressive disorder for which 4-6 ECT sessions were performed.
