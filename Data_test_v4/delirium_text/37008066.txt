37008066|t|Cardiac Troponin, Cognitive Function, and Dementia: A Systematic Review.
37008066|a|Elevated cardiac troponin, a biomarker of myocardial injury, has been found in individuals with brain damage and lower cognitive function. We conducted a systematic review to examine the association of troponin with cognitive function, incidence of dementia and dementia-related outcomes. PubMed, Web of Science and EMBASE were searched from inception to August 2022. Inclusion criteria were: (i) population-based cohort studies; (ii) troponin measured as determinant; and (iii) cognitive function in any metric or diagnosis of any type of dementia or dementia-related measures as outcomes. Fourteen studies were identified and included, with a combined total of 38,286 participants. Of these studies, four examined dementia-related outcomes, eight studies examined cognitive function, and two studies examined both dementia-related outcomes and cognitive function. Studies report higher troponin to be associated with higher prevalence of cognitive impairment (n=1), incident dementia (n=1), increased risk of dementia hospitalization (specifically due to vascular dementia) (n=1), but not with incident Alzheimer's Disease (n=2). Majority of studies on cognitive function found elevated troponin also associated with worse global cognitive function (n=3), attention (n=2), reaction time (n=1) and visuomotor speed (n=1), both cross-sectionally and prospectively. Evidence regarding the association between higher troponin and memory, executive function, processing speed, language and visuospatial function was mixed. This was the first systematic review on the association between troponin, cognitive function, and dementia. Higher troponin is associated with subclinical cerebrovascular damage and might act as a risk-marker of cognitive vulnerability.
