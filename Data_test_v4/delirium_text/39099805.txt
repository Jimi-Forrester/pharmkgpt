39099805|a|BACKGROUND: Dysfunction of the glymphatic system in the brain in different stages of altered glucose metabolism and its influencing factors are not well characterized. AIM: To investigate the function of the glymphatic system and its clinical correlates in patients with different glucose metabolism states, the present study employed diffusion tensor imaging along the perivascular space (DTI-ALPS) index. METHODS: Sample size was calculated using the pwr package in R software. This cross-sectional study enrolled 22 patients with normal glucose metabolism (NGM), 20 patients with prediabetes, and 22 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). A 3.0T magnetic resonance imaging was used to evaluate the function of the glymphatic system. The mini-mental state examination (MMSE) was used to assess general cognitive function. The DTI-ALPS index of bilateral basal ganglia and the mean DTI-ALPS index was calculated. Further, the correlation between DTI-ALPS and clinical features was assessed. RESULTS: The left-side, right-side, and mean DTI-ALPS index in the T2DM group were significantly lower than that in the NGM group. The right-side DTI-ALPS and mean DTI-ALPS index in the T2DM group were significantly lower than those in the prediabetes group. DTI-ALPS index lateralization was not observed. The MMSE score in the T2DM group was significantly lower than that in the NGM and prediabetes group. After controlling for sex, the left-side DTI-ALPS and mean DTI-ALPS index in the prediabetes group were positively correlated with 2-hour postprandial blood glucose level; the left-side DTI-ALPS index was negatively correlated with total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein level. The right-side DTI-ALPS and mean DTI-ALPS index were negatively correlated with the glycosylated hemoglobin level and waist-to-hip ratio in the prediabetes group. The left-side, right-side, and mean DTI-ALPS index in the T2DM group were positively correlated with height. The left-side and mean DTI-ALPS index in the T2DM group were negatively correlated with high-density lipoprotein levels. CONCLUSION: Cerebral glymphatic system dysfunction may mainly occur in the T2DM stage. Various clinical variables were found to affect the DTI-ALPS index in different glucose metabolism states. This study enhances our understanding of the pathophysiology of diabetic brain damage and provides some potential biological evidence for its early diagnosis.
