25815030|a|The main purpose of this study was to demonstrate the therapeutic effects and mechanism of TDJW, a modern Chinese medicine prescription developed based on the basic traditional Chinese medicine theory of "tonifying the kidney essence," on the Abeta 25-35-induced AD rats. The AD model was established by the intracerebroventricular administrations of Abeta 25-35 into the hippocampus CA1 tissue of SD male rats. 72 rats were randomly divided into six groups: sham operation, AD model, donepezil, high TDJW group, medium TDJW group, and low TDJW group. After oral administration of TDJW, the results of Morris water maze and step-down test showed that the learning and memory abilities of AD rats were significantly improved. And biochemical measurement demonstrated that Ach and Glu in hippocampus tissues of AD rats were increased as well. Moreover, the Abeta deposits and p-Tau aggregations in hippocampus CA1 tissues of AD rats were attenuated as observed in the micrographs of immunohistochemistry study, and the results of ELISA indicated that the expressions of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6 in hippocampus tissues were significantly decreased. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that TDJW could be used as a promising therapeutic agent for the clinical applications of AD treatment in patients.
