33274830|t|Prevalent intron retention fine-tunes gene expression and contributes to cellular senescence.
33274830|a|Intron retention (IR) is the least well-understood alternative splicing type in animals, and its prevalence and function in physiological and pathological processes have long been underestimated. Cellular senescence contributes to individual aging and age-related diseases and can also serve as an important cancer prevention mechanism. Dynamic IR events have been observed in senescence models and aged tissues; however, whether and how IR impacts senescence remain unclear. Through analyzing polyA+ RNA-seq data from human replicative senescence models, we found IR was prevalent and dynamically regulated during senescence and IR changes negatively correlated with expression alteration of corresponding genes. We discovered that knocking down (KD) splicing factor U2AF1, which showed higher binding density to retained introns and decreased expression during senescence, led to senescence-associated phenotypes and global IR changes. Intriguingly, U2AF1-KD-induced IR changes also negatively correlated with gene expression. Furthermore, we demonstrated that U2AF1-mediated IR of specific gene (CPNE1 as an example) contributed to cellular senescence. Decreased expression of U2AF1, higher IR of CPNE1, and reduced expression of CPNE1 were also discovered in dermal fibroblasts with age. We discovered prevalent IR could fine-tune gene expression and contribute to senescence-associated phenotypes, largely extending the biological significance of IR.
