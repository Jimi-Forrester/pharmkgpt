38540727|t|Untargeted and Oxylipin-Targeted Metabolomics Study on the Plasma Samples of Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma Patients.
38540727|a|Purpose: to determine the metabolomics profiles in the plasma samples of primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) patients. Methods: The plasma samples from 20 POAG patients under intraocular pressure (IOP)-lowering medication treatment and 20 control subjects were subjected to the untargeted metabolomics analysis, among which 10 POAG patients and 10 control subjects were further subjected to the oxylipin-targeted metabolomics analysis by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. The prediction accuracy of the differentially abundant metabolites was assessed by the receiver operating characteristic curves. Pathway analysis and correlation analysis on the differentially abundant metabolites and clinical and biochemical parameters were also conducted. Results: Untargeted metabolomics profiling identified 33 differentially abundant metabolites in the POAG patients, in which the metabolism of linoleic acid, alpha-linolenic acid, phenylalanine, and tricarboxylic acid cycle were enriched. The correlation analysis indicated that the differentially abundant metabolites were associated with central corneal thickness, peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness, visual field defects, and lymphocytes. The oxylipin-targeted metabolomics analysis identified 15-keto-Prostaglandin F2 alpha, 13,14-Dihydro-15-keto-prostaglandin D2, 11-Dehydro-thromboxane B2, 8,9-Epoxyeicosatrienoic acid, and arachidonic acid to be significantly decreased in the POAG patients and enriched in the arachidonic acid (AA) pathway. Conclusions: This study revealed that the metabolites in the arachidonic acid metabolism pathway are differentially abundant, suggesting high IOP may not be the only detrimental factor for optic nerve cell damage in this group of POAG patients. Lipid metabolism instability-mediated alterations in oxylipins and AA pathways may be important in POAG, suggesting that oxidative stress and immune-related inflammation could be valuable directions for future therapeutic strategies.
