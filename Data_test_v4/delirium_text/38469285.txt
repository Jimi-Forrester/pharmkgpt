38469285|t|Sleep disorders affect cognitive function in adults: an overview of systematic reviews and meta-analyses.
38469285|a|Sleep disorders frequently result in poor memory, attention deficits, as well as a worse prognosis for neurodegenerative changes, such as Alzheimer's disease. The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of sleep disorders on cognition. We screened four databases for all meta-analyses and systematic reviews from the establishment through March 2022. We have carried out quality evaluation and review the eligible systematic reviews. Evidence grading and quality assessment were performed on 22 eligible articles. Sleep deprivation primarily affects simple attention, complex attention, and working memory in cognition and alertness. The moderate-to-high-quality evidence proves optimal sleep time as 7-8 h. Sleep time outside this range increases the risk of impaired executive function, non-verbal memory, and working memory. Sleep-related breathing disorders is more likely to cause mild cognitive impairment and affects several cognitive domains. In older adults, insomnia primarily affects working memory, episodic memory, inhibitory control, cognitive flexibility, problem-solving, operational ability, perceptual function, alertness, and complex attention, and maintaining sensitivity. Sleep disturbances significantly impair cognitive function, and early detection and intervention may be critical steps in reducing poor prognosis. A simple neuropsychological memory test could be used to screen people with sleep disorders for cognitive impairment.
