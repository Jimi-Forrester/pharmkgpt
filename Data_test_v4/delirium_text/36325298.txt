36325298|t|Unique Morphometric Features of the Cerebellum and Cerebellocerebral Structural Correlation Between Autism Spectrum Disorder and Schizophrenia.
36325298|a|Background: Although cerebellar morphological involvement has been increasingly recognized in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and schizophrenia (SZ), the extent to which there are morphological differences between them has not been definitively quantified. Furthermore, although previous studies have demonstrated increased anatomical cerebellocerebral correlations in both conditions, differences between their associations have not been well characterized. Methods: We compared cerebellar volume between males with ASD (n = 31), males with SZ (n = 28), and typically developing males (n = 49). A total of 31 cerebellar subregions were investigated with the cerebellum segmented into their constituent lobules, in gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) separately. Additionally, structural correlations with the contralateral cerebrum were analyzed for each cerebellar lobule. Results: We found significantly larger WM volume in the bilateral lobules VI and Crus I in the ASD group than in other groups. While WM or GM volumes of these right lobules had positive associations with ASD symptoms, there was a negative association between GM volume of the right Crus I and SZ symptoms. We further observed, in the ASD group specifically, significant correlations between WM of the right lobule VI and WM of the left frontal pole (r = 0.67) and between GM of the right lobule VI and the left caudate (r = 0.60). Conclusions: Our findings support evidence that cerebellar morphology is involved in ASD and SZ with different mechanisms. Furthermore, this study showed that these biological differences require consideration when determining diagnostic criteria and treatment for these disorders.
