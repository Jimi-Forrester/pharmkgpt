28083879|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate effects of a novel dementia care coordination program on health services utilization. DATA SOURCES/STUDY SETTING: A total of 303 community-dwelling adults aged >=70 with a cognitive disorder in Baltimore, Maryland (2008-2011). STUDY DESIGN: Single-blind RCT evaluating efficacy of an 18-month care coordination intervention delivered through community-based nonclinical care coordinators, supported by an interdisciplinary clinical team. DATA COLLECTION/EXTRACTION METHODS: Study partners reported acute care/inpatient, outpatient, and home- and community-based service utilization at baseline, 9, and 18 months. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: From baseline to 18 months, there were no significant group differences in acute care/inpatient or total outpatient services use, although intervention participants had significantly increased outpatient dementia/mental health visits from 9 to 18 months (p = .04) relative to controls. Home and community-based support service use significantly increased from baseline to 18 months in the intervention compared to control (p = .005). CONCLUSIONS: While this dementia care coordination program did not impact acute care/inpatient services utilization, it increased use of dementia-related outpatient medical care and nonmedical supportive community services, a combination that may have helped participants remain at home longer. Future care model modifications that emphasize delirium, falls prevention, and behavior management may be needed to influence inpatient service use.
