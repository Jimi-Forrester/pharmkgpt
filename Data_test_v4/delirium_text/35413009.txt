35413009|t|The Potential Effects of a Compounded Methylcobalamin Nasal Spray on Short-term Memory Loss After Intracranial Hemorrhage: A Case Report.
35413009|a|Short-term memory loss is a common complication after intracranial hemorrhage or traumatic brain injury. FDA-approved cholinesterase inhibitors for memory symptoms of Alzheimer's disease have not been proven effective for improving memory impairment resulting from a hemorrhagic event. The purpose of this case study was to present the potential effectiveness of a compounded nasal spray containing methylcobalamin in improving short-term memory function in a patient post-intracranial hemorrhage. The patient started to administer the methylcobalamin nasal spray once daily after suffering from short-term memory loss for four years. His verbal memory, visual memory, and quality of life were assessed by the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised, Benton Visual Retention Test, and the 36-Item Short Form Survey, respectively, at baseline and 30 days after treatment. The delayed recall test was repeated after 60 days. After 30 days of treatment, the patient received improved scores in both verbal and visual memory tests, as well as improved self-reported quality of life. The patient became less dependent on phone reminders in daily life. The improvement in delayed recall remained significant after 60 days of treatment. This case report suggests a potentially safe and effective therapy for attenuating short-term memory impairment after intracranial hemorrhage.
