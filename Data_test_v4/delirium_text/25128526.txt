25128526|a|Abnormal hyperphosphorylation of Tau leads to the formation of neurofibrillary tangles, a hallmark of Alzheimer disease (AD), and related tauopathies. The phosphorylation of Tau is regulated by protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), which in turn is modulated by endogenous inhibitor 2 (I2 (PP2A)). In AD brain, I2 (PP2A) is translocated from neuronal nucleus to cytoplasm, where it inhibits PP2A activity and promotes abnormal phosphorylation of Tau. Here we describe the identification of a potential nuclear localization signal (NLS) in the C-terminal region of I2 (PP2A) containing a conserved basic motif, (179)RKR(181), which is sufficient for directing its nuclear localization. The current study further presents an inducible cell model (Tet-Off system) of AD-type abnormal hyperphosphorylation of Tau by expressing I2 (PP2A) in which the NLS was inactivated by (179)RKR(181)   AAA along with (168)KR(169)   AA mutations. In this model, the mutant NLS (mNLS)-I2 (PP2A) (I2 (PP2A)AA-AAA) was retained in the cell cytoplasm, where it physically interacted with PP2A and inhibited its activity. Inhibition of PP2A was associated with the abnormal hyperphosphorylation of Tau, which resulted in microtubule network instability and neurite outgrowth impairment. Expression of mNLS-I2 (PP2A) activated CAMKII and GSK-3beta, which are Tau kinases regulated by PP2A. The immunoprecipitation experiments showed the direct interaction of I2 (PP2A) with PP2A and GSK-3beta but not with CAMKII. Thus, the cell model provides insights into the nature of the potential NLS and the mechanistic relationship between I2 (PP2A)-induced inhibition of PP2A and hyperphosphorylation of Tau that can be utilized to develop drugs preventing Tau pathology.
