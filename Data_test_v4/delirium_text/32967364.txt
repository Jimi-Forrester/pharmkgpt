32967364|t|Hippocampal Impairment Triggered by Long-Term Lead Exposure from Adolescence to Adulthood in Rats: Insights from Molecular to Functional Levels.
32967364|a|Lead (Pb) is an environmental and occupational neurotoxicant after long-term exposure. This study aimed to investigate the effects of systemic Pb exposure in rats from adolescence to adulthood, evaluating molecular, morphologic and functional aspects of hippocampus. For this, male Wistar rats were exposed to 50 mg/kg of Pb acetate or distilled water for 55 days by intragastric gavage. For the evaluation of short-term and long-term memories, object recognition and step-down inhibitory avoidance tests were performed. At the end of the behavioral tests, the animals were euthanized and the hippocampus dissected and processed to the evaluation of: Pb content levels in hippocampal parenchyma; Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC), glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels as parameters of oxidative stress and antioxidant status; global proteomic profile and neuronal degeneration by anti-NeuN immunohistochemistry analysis. Our results show the increase of Pb levels in the hippocampus of adult rats exposed from adolescence, increased MDA and GSH levels, modulation of proteins related to neural structure and physiology and reduced density of neurons, hence a poor cognitive performance on short and long-term memories. Then, the long-term exposure to Pb in this period of life may impair several biologic organizational levels of the hippocampal structure associated with functional damages.
