24662099|a|Accumulation of neurotoxic amyloid-beta (Abeta) is a major hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology and an important player in its clinical manifestations. Formation of Abeta is controlled by the availability of an enzyme called gamma-secretase. Despite its blockers being attractive therapeutic tools for lowering Abeta, this approach has failed because of their serious toxic side-effects. The discovery of the gamma-secretase activating protein (GSAP), a co-factor for this protease which facilitates Abeta production without affecting other pathways responsible for the toxicity, is giving us the opportunity to develop a safer anti-Abeta therapy. In this study we have characterized the effect of Imatinib, an inhibitor of GSAP, in the 3xTg mice, a mouse model of AD with plaques and tangles. Compared with controls, mice receiving the drug had a significant reduction in brain Abeta levels and deposition, but no changes in the steady state levels of AbetaPP, BACE-1, ADAM-10, or the four components of the gamma-secretase complex. By contrast, Imatinib-treated animals had a significant increase in CTF-beta and a significant reduction in GSAP expression levels. Additionally, we observed that tau phosphorylation was reduced at specific epitopes together with its insoluble fraction. In vitro studies confirmed that Imatinib prevents Abeta formation by modulating gamma-secretase activity and GSAP levels. Our findings represent the first in vivo demonstration of the biological role that GSAP plays in the development of the AD-like neuropathologies. They establish this protein as a viable target for a safer anti-Abeta therapeutic approach in AD.
