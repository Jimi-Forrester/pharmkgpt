37840824|t|Can Patients with Asymptomatic/Mild Illness and Moderate Illness COVID-19 Have White Matter Damage?
37840824|a|Background and Purpose: Studies have shown that severe coronavirus pandemic 2019 infection could lead to white matter hyperintensities, but the relationship between asymptomatic/mild illness and moderate illness coronavirus pandemic 2019 and white matter hyperintensities remains largely unknown. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between asymptomatic/mild illness and moderate illness coronavirus pandemic 2019 and the risk of white matter hyperintensities. Methods: Hospitalized patients who were confirmed to have coronavirus pandemic 2019 for the first time were enrolled. Fazekas scores were used for assessment of the severity of white matter hyperintensities. We also rated the 90-day functional outcome after discharge. Results: Of the 157 enrolled patients, 124 (78.98%) coronavirus pandemic 2019 patients were classified as having asymptomatic or mild illness, and 33 (21.02%) were classified as having moderate illness. The results showed that the Fazekas scale scores at baseline (periventricular white matter hyperintensities, 1.31+-1.16 vs 2.06+-1.20; Deep white matter hyperintensities, 1.04+-0.97 vs 1.73+-1.13 P <0.01) and at follow-up (periventricular white matter hyperintensities, 1.38+-1.21 vs 2.09+-1.21; Deep white matter hyperintensities, 1.13+-1.04 vs 1.79+-1.14 P <0.01) were lower in patients with symptomatic or mild illness than in those with moderate illness. Moreover, no significant difference (7.26% vs 3.03%; P =0.377) was observed between the two divided groups in terms of white matter hyperintensities progression. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that moderate COVID-19 is related to severe white matter hyperintensities compared with asymptomatic/mild illness but not to the progression of white matter hyperintensities.
