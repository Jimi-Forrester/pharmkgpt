36291595|t|Selecting Multitarget Peptides for Alzheimer's Disease.
36291595|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifactorial disease with a complex pathogenesis. Developing multitarget drugs could be a powerful strategy to impact the progressive loss of cognitive functions in this disease. The purpose of this study is to select a multitarget lead peptide candidate among a series of peptide variants derived from the neutrophil granule protein cathepsin G. We screened eight peptide candidates using the following criteria: (1) Inhibition and reversion of amyloid beta (Abeta) oligomers, quantified using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); (2) direct binding of peptide candidates to the human receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE), the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and the S100 calcium-binding protein A9 (S100A9), quantified by ELISA; (3) protection against Abeta oligomer-induced neuronal cell death, using trypan blue to measure cell death in a murine neuronal cell line; (4) inhibition of TLR4 activation by S100A9, using a human TLR4 reporter cell line. We selected a 27-mer lead peptide that fulfilled these four criteria. This lead peptide is a privileged structure that displays inherent multitarget activity. This peptide is expected to significantly impact cognitive decline in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease, by targeting both neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration.
