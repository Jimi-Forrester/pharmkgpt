38829609|t|Comparison of the HugeMed video laryngoscope with the Macintosh direct laryngoscope for nasotracheal tracheal intubation in children undergoing dental treatment: a randomized controlled clinical study.
38829609|a|OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to compare the performance of the HugeMed  videolaryngoscope with a direct Macintosh laryngoscope for nasotracheal intubation. METHODS: Eighty-eight children aged 4-10 years were randomly assigned to either the HugeMed  videolaryngoscope (HVL) or the Macintosh direct laryngoscope (MDL) group. Intubation difficulty, glottic view grade, time-to-intubation, number of tracheal intubation attempts, use of external laryngeal manipulation and Magill forceps, recovery time, pediatric-anesthesia-delirium-scale (PAEDS) scores, pain due to tracheal intubation, and laryngeal bleeding were evaluated. RESULTS: Easy tracheal intubation incidence was higher in the HVL group than that in the MDL group (p = 0.001). Glottic view was better in the HVL group as compared to the MDL group (p = 0.027). There was no difference between the groups in terms of time-to-tracheal intubation, number of tracheal intubation attempts, Magill forceps usage, pain, and bleeding due to tracheal intubation. The need for external laryngeal manipulation (p = 0.004) and PAEDS scores (p = 0.006) were higher in the MDL group than those in the HVL group. CONCLUSION: HugeMed  videolaryngoscope may provide easier tracheal intubation, create a better glottic view, and significantly reduce the need for additional manipulation compared to the Macintosh direct laryngoscope, for nasotracheal intubation.
