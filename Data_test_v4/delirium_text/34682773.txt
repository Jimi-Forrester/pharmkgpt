34682773|t|The Interplay between Anticholinergic Burden and Anemia in Relation to 1-Year Mortality among Older Patients Discharged from Acute Care Hospitals.
34682773|a|Anticholinergic burden (ACB) and anemia were found associated with an increased risk of death among older patients. Additionally, anticholinergic medications may contribute to the development of anemia. Therefore, we aimed at investigating the prognostic interplay of ACB and anemia among older patients discharged from hospital. Our series consisted of 783 patients enrolled in a multicenter observational study. The outcome of the study was 1 year mortality. ACB was assessed by an Anticholinergic Cognitive Burden score. Anemia was defined as hemoglobin < 13 g/dL in men and <12 g/dL in women. The association between study variables and mortality was investigated by Cox regression analysis. After adjusting for several potential confounders, ACB score = 2 or more was significantly associated with the outcome in anemic patients (HR = 1.93, 95%CI = 1.13-3.40), but not non anemic patients (HR = 1.51, 95%CI = 0.65-3.48). An additive prognostic interaction between ACB and anemia was observed (p = 0.02). Anemia may represent a relevant effect modifier in the association between ACB and mortality.
