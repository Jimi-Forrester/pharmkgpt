17925895|a|This Society for Medicines Research symposium was held on June 6, 2007, at the Eli Lilly Research Centre in Windlesham, Surrey, United Kingdom. The meeting, organized by Eric Karran and Alan Palmer, reviewed the progress made, and the challenges still to be overcome, in discovering safe and effective therapies for the most common chronic neurodegenerative diseases: Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis. Progress in establishing effective pharmacotherapy for acute neurodegenerative disorders (stroke and traumatic brain injury) was also reviewed.
