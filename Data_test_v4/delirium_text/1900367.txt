1900367|t|Expression of the amyloid precursor protein gene in mouse oocytes and embryos.
1900367|a|The amyloid precursor protein (APP) is thought to be processed aberrantly to yield the major constituent of the amyloid plaques observed in the brains of patients with Alzheimer disease and Down syndrome. However, the gene encoding APP is expressed widely in normal human tissues and in adult and fetal mouse tissues and is alternatively spliced in a tissue-specific pattern in the adult. There is evidence that APP may function as a growth factor and as a mediator of cell adhesion and in these roles could be important in morphogenesis. As a step toward determining the role of APP in development and in determining how the adult pattern of tissue-specific splicing is established, we have used reverse transcription and the polymerase chain reaction to demonstrate APP expression in mouse oocytes, preimplantation embryos, and postimplantation embryonic stages to the late embryonic period. All three splicing forms described in mouse were present at each stage, although there were changes in the ratios of the splicing forms at different stages. Screens for APP clones in embryonic cDNA libraries from the egg cylinder stage and the early somite stage were used to confirm the results of the polymerase chain reaction, and APP clone abundance was found to increase 10-fold between the two stages.
