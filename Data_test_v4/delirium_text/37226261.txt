37226261|a|BACKGROUND: Prevalence, risk factors and medical management of persistent pain symptoms after critical care illness have not been thoroughly investigated. METHODS: We performed a prospective multicentric study in patients with an intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay >= 48 h. The primary outcome was the prevalence of significant persistent pain, defined as a numeric rating scale (NRS) >= 3, 3 months after admission. Secondary outcomes were the prevalence of symptoms compatible with neuropathic pain (ID-pain score > 3) and the risk factors of persistent pain. RESULTS: Eight hundred fourteen patients were included over a 10-month period in 26 centers. Patients had a mean age of 57 (+- 17) years with a SAPS 2 score of 32 (+- 16) (mean +- SD). The median ICU length of stay was 6 [4-12] days (median [interquartile]). At 3 months, the median intensity of pain symptoms was 2 [1-5] in the entire population, and 388 (47.7%) patients had significant pain. In this group, 34 (8.7%) patients had symptoms compatible with neuropathic pain. Female (Odds Ratio 1.5 95% CI [1.1-2.1]), prior use of anti-depressive agents (OR 2.2 95% CI [1.3-4]), prone positioning (OR 3 95% CI [1.4-6.4]) and the presence of pain symptoms on ICU discharge (NRS >= 3) (OR 2.4 95% CI [1.7-3.4]) were risk factors of persistent pain. Compared with sepsis, patients admitted for trauma (non neuro) (OR 3.5 95% CI [2.1-6]) were particularly at risk of persistent pain. Only 35 (11.3%) patients had specialist pain management by 3 months. CONCLUSIONS: Persistent pain symptoms were frequent in critical illness survivors and specialized management remained infrequent. Innovative approaches must be developed in the ICU to minimize the consequences of pain. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT04817696. Registered March 26, 2021.
