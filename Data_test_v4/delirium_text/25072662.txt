25072662|a|PATIENT: Male, 23. FINAL DIAGNOSIS: Thyroid storm. SYMPTOMS: Delirium   diarrhea   fever   hypertension   hyperventilation   tachycardia   weight loss. MEDICATION: -. CLINICAL PROCEDURE: -. SPECIALTY: Endocrinology and Metabolic. OBJECTIVE: Unusual clinical course. BACKGROUND: The clinical presentation of thyroid storm includes fever, tachycardia, hypertension, and neurological abnormalities. It is a serious condition with a high mortality rate. Furthermore, some other complications affect the clinical course of thyroid storm. Although it is reported that prognosis is poor when thyroid storm is complicated by disseminated intravascular coagulation syndrome (DIC) and leukopenia, reports of such cases are rare. CASE REPORT: A 23-year-old man presented with delirium, high pyrexia, diarrhea, and weight loss of 18 kg over 2 months. According to the criteria of Burch and Wartofsky, he was diagnosed with thyroid storm on the basis of his symptom-complex and laboratory data that confirmed the presence of hyperthyroidism. Investigations also found leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and disseminated intravascular coagulation, all of which are very rare complications of thyroid storm. We successfully treated him with combined therapy including anti-thyroid medication, despite leukopenia. CONCLUSIONS: Early diagnosis and treatment are essential in ensuring a good outcome for patients with this rare combination of medical problems.
