38814061|t|Longitudinal Trajectories of Stress and Positive Aspects of Dementia Caregiving: Findings From the IDEAL Programme.
38814061|a|OBJECTIVES: Understanding what influences changes over time in caregiver well-being is important for the development of effective support. This study explores differences in trajectories of caregiver stress and positive aspects of caregiving (PAC). METHODS: Caregivers of community-dwelling individuals with mild-to-moderate dementia at baseline from the IDEAL cohort were interviewed at baseline (n = 1,203), 12 months (n = 917), and 24 months (n = 699). Growth mixture models identified multiple growth trajectories of caregiver stress and PAC in the caregiver population. Associations between study measures and trajectory classes were examined using multinomial logistic regression and mixed-effects models. RESULTS: Mean stress scores increased over time. A 4-class solution was identified: a "high" stable class (8.3%) with high levels of stress, a "middle" class (46.1%) with slightly increasing levels of stress, a "low" class (39.5%) with initial low levels of stress which slightly increased over time, and a small "increasing" class (6.1%) where stress level started low but increased at a steeper rate. Mean PAC scores remained stable over time. A 5-class solution was identified: 3 stable classes ("high," 15.2%; "middle," 67.6%; "low" 9.3%), a small "increasing" (3.4%) class, and 1 "decreasing" class (4.5%). For stable classes, positive ratings on study measures tended to be associated with lower stress or higher PAC trajectories and vice versa. Those with "increasing" stress also had worsening trajectories of several study measures including depression, relationship quality, competence, and ability to cope. DISCUSSION: The findings highlight the importance of identifying caregivers at risk of increased stress and declining PAC and offering them targeted support.
