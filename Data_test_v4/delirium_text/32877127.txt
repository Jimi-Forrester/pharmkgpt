32877127|a|Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (with the announcement of the diagnosis). The number of patients consulting to find out if they have Alzheimer's disease continues to grow. Reasons to consult most often include anxiety about being affected by this disease, confidence in medical and therapeutic advances relayed in the media and the desire to plan for the future, taking into account a possible deterioration. Advances in the knowledge of the natural history of the disease and the technical progress currently allow an early diagnosis, before the stage of dementia. Although the clinical use of biomarkers is justified in patients who have attended a Memory Clinic, ethical issues remain. The disclosure of the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease to the person who is not yet suffering from dementia remains a sensitive subject. In this context, it seems appropriate at this stage to restrict the use of these methods to centers specializing in early diagnosis.
