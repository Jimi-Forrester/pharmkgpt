34002143|a|BACKGROUND: Bone cement implantation syndrome (BCIS) is characterized by hypotension, arrhythmia, diffuse pulmonary microvascular embolism, shock, cardiac arrest, any combination of these factors, or even death following bone cement implantation. CASE SUMMARY: An 80-year-old patient with pemphigus and Parkinson's disease underwent total hip replacement under spinal subarachnoid block and developed acute pulmonary embolism after bone cement implantation. The patient received mask mechanical ventilation with a continuous intravenous infusion of adrenaline (2 mug/mL) at a rate of 30 mL/h. Subsequently, the symptoms of BCIS were markedly alleviated, and the infusion rate of adrenaline was gradually reduced until the infusion was completely stopped 45 min later. The patient was then transferred to the Department of Orthopedics, and anticoagulation therapy began at 12 h postoperatively. No other complications were observed. CONCLUSION: This is a rare case of BCIS in a high-risk patient with pemphigus and Parkinson's disease.
