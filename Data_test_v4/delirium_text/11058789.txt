11058789|a|Recent reports have suggested that genetic polymorphisms in the alpha-2 macroglobulin (A2M) gene are associated with an increased risk for Alzheimer's disease. In the present study we tested two polymorphisms in the alpha-2 macroglobulin gene, a 5 bp deletion at the 5' splice site of exon 18 and a G/A point mutation (V1000I) in exon 24, in a sample of 118 healthy, non demented controls and 238 consecutively recruited gerontopsychiatric patients, diagnosed as: Alzheimer's disease (N=88), mild cognitive impairment (N=32), subjective cognitive complaints (N=54) and depression/other psychiatric disorders (N=64). The aim of this study was to test whether the investigated polymorphisms has a high enough selectivity and specificity to distinguish between the different gerontopsychiatric disorders or to differentiate genetically AD from other forms of dementia, respectively. Also a possible relation to the APOE varepsilon4 polymorphism was examined. Our study failed to show an association between the two investigated polymorphisms in the alpha-2 macroglobulin gene and any of the four different psychogeriatric patient subgroups, either alone or in combination with the APOE varepsilon4 genotype.
