37885898|t|Predictors of Survival Among the Oldest Old Following Acute Hospital Admission: Insights From Clinical and Biochemical Factors.
37885898|a|Understanding the factors influencing survival in oldest old population is crucial for providing appropriate care and improving outcomes. This prospective observational study aimed to investigate the determinants of survival in acutely ill oldest old patients during acute hospitalization and 1-month follow-up. Various geriatric domains and biochemical markers were assessed. Among the 70 included patients with a median age of 87 (Inter quartile range: 85-90), the presence of diabetes, delirium, tachypnea, and high sirtuin-5 levels were associated with reduced in-hospital survival. Non-survivors had raised levels of Sirtuin 1 and Sirtuin 5, with an increase of 43% and 70%, respectively. At 1 month, delirium and diabetes were still associated with reduced survival. These findings suggest that type-2 diabetes, delirium, tachypnea, and high sirtuin-5 levels could serve as predictors of reduced survival in acutely ill, hospitalized oldest old patients.
