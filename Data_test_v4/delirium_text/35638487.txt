35638487|a|BACKGROUND: Acute illness and hospitalisation detriment the nutritional status of older patients. This study aimed to describe the prevalence of malnutrition, characteristics and in-hospital outcomes associated with malnutrition, and nutritional management among patients who were admitted to the Subacute Geriatric Ward. METHODS: This is a retrospective study of older patients (age >= 60) who were admitted to the Subacute Geriatric Ward of Kuala Lumpur Hospital from 1 March 2021 to 31 May 2021. Malnutrition was identified using the Mini Nutritional Assessment-Short Form (MNA-SF). The in-hospital outcomes evaluated were hospital-associated complications, namely delirium, functional decline, incontinence, inpatient falls, inpatient pressure injuries, hospital-acquired infection, institutionalisation, and inpatient mortality. RESULTS: Seventy-three patients were included (mean age 74.7, female 58.9%), of which 28 (38.4%) and 27 (37.0%) were malnourished and at risk of malnutrition, respectively. Poorer nutritional status was associated with increased age, comorbidity burden, frailty, immobility, impaired basic activities of daily living, history of falls, cognitive impairment, incontinence, and arthritis. About 71.2% and 60.3% of patients were offered dietitian review and oral nutritional supplements, respectively. The in-hospital outcome rates were higher among malnourished patients, but the differences were not statistically significant. However, multiple hospital-associated complications were more common with poorer nutritional status (p = 0.018). CONCLUSION: Hospital malnutrition is prevalent among older patients, and unidentified malnutrition is not justified due to its association with multiple adverse outcomes.
