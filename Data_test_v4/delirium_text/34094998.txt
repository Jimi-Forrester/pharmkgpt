34094998|a|Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a common cause of liver cirrhosis. To identify the characteristics of the oral microbiome in patients with AIH, we collected 204 saliva samples including 68 AIH patients and 136 healthy controls and performed microbial MiSeq sequencing after screening. All samples were randomly divided into discovery cohorts (46 AIH and 92 HCs) and validation cohorts (22 AIH and 44 HCs). Moreover, we collected samples of 12 AIH patients from Hangzhou for cross-regional validation. We described the oral microbiome characteristics of AIH patients and established a diagnostic model. In the AIH group, the oral microbiome diversity was significantly increased. The microbial communities remarkably differed between the two groups. Seven genera, mainly Fusobacterium, Actinomyces and Capnocytophaga, were dominant in the HC group, while 51 genera, Streptococcus, Veillonella and Leptotrichia, were enriched in the AIH group. Notably, we found 23 gene functions, including Membrane Transport, Carbohydrate Metabolism, and Glycerolipid metabolism that were dominant in AIH and 31 gene functions that prevailed in HCs. We further investigated the correlation between the oral microbiome and clinical parameters. The optimal 5 microbial markers were figured out through a random forest model, and the distinguishing potential achieved 99.88% between 46 AIH and 92 HCs in the discovery cohort and 100% in the validation cohort. Importantly, the distinguishing potential reached 95.55% in the cross-regional validation cohort. In conclusion, this study is the first to characterize the oral microbiome in AIH patients and to report the successful establishment of a diagnostic model and the cross-regional validation of microbial markers for AIH. Importantly, oral microbiota-targeted biomarkers may be able to serve as powerful and noninvasive diagnostic tools for AIH.
