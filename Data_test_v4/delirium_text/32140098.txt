32140098|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder and the main cause of dementia among the elderly worldwide. Unfortunately, the mechanism of AD remains unclear, and no effective therapies are available yet. An increasing amount of studies have demonstrated that long non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs) play a notable role in the pathogenesis of plenty of human diseases, and they have served as biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets. However, the function of LncRNAs in AD remains unclear. This study aimed to explore the potential role of LncRNA nuclear enriched abundant transcript 1 (NEAT1) in AD. We found that LncRNA NEAT1 was upregulated in the AD animal models. Furthermore, we demonstrated that NEAT1 could interact with NEDD4L and promote PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1)'s ubiquitination and degradation and then impaired PINK1-dependent autophagy. Collectively, the lncRNA NEAT1 promotes the pathogenesis of AD and serves as a promising novel target for pharmacological intervention.
