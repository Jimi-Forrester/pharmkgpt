21741455|t|Alzheimer's disease: cholesterol a menace?
21741455|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease manifested by cognitive and memory deterioration, culminating in a spectrum of neuropsychiatric disturbances and the impairment of daily activities. AD is a multifactorial disease with a range of contributing factors which includes genes and diet. The magnitude of AD is reflected in the loss of individuality of the affected person and in the terminal course through which the disease develops. In this review, we aim to provide a background on AD and the contribution of cholesterol in the etiology of Alzheimer's. Cholesterol seems to be intimately linked with the generation of amyloid plaques, which is central to the pathogenesis of AD. Although there are conflicting reports on the role of cholesterol in AD, majority of the studies point out the positive association of cholesterol with AD.
