37238714|t|Overview of the Impact of Pathogenic LRRK2 Mutations in Parkinson's Disease.
37238714|a|Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) is a large protein kinase that physiologically phosphorylates and regulates the function of several Rab proteins. LRRK2 is genetically implicated in the pathogenesis of both familial and sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD), although the underlying mechanism is not well understood. Several pathogenic mutations in the LRRK2 gene have been identified, and in most cases the clinical symptoms that PD patients with LRRK2 mutations develop are indistinguishable from those of typical PD. However, it has been shown that the pathological manifestations in the brains of PD patients with LRRK2 mutations are remarkably variable when compared to sporadic PD, ranging from typical PD pathology with Lewy bodies to nigral degeneration with deposition of other amyloidogenic proteins. The pathogenic mutations in LRRK2 are also known to affect the functions and structure of LRRK2, the differences in which may be partly attributable to the variations observed in patient pathology. In this review, in order to help researchers unfamiliar with the field to understand the mechanism of pathogenesis of LRRK2-associated PD, we summarize the clinical and pathological manifestations caused by pathogenic mutations in LRRK2, their impact on the molecular function and structure of LRRK2, and their historical background.
