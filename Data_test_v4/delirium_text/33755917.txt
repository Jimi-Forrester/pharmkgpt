33755917|a|BACKGROUND: Reminiscence therapy is revealed to improve cognitive function and attenuate psychological disorders in neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's disease patients, while its application in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is seldom reported. So, the current study aimed to explore the effect of reminiscence therapy on cognitive impairment, anxiety, depression, and disease recurrence in AIS patients. METHODS: A total of 216 first-ever AIS patients were enrolled and randomized into reminiscence therapy group or control group in 1:1 ratio. MMSE, HADS, and Zung SAS/SDS scales were evaluated at the discharge from hospital (M0), 3 months (M3), 6 months (M6), 9 months (M9), and 12 months (M12), respectively. Besides, patients were further followed up to 36 months for recurrence-free survival (RFS) calculation. RESULTS: Reminiscence therapy group showed higher MMSE score at M9 and M12, lower cognitive impairment rate by MMSE at M12 compared to control group. As to anxiety, HADS-anxiety score and anxiety rate by HADS were of no difference at each time point, while SAS score and anxiety rate by SAS were lower at M12 in reminiscence therapy group compared with control group. Regarding depression, HADS-depression score and depression rate by HADS at M12, SDS score at M9 and M12, and depression rate by SDS at M12 were all lower in reminiscence therapy group compared with control group. In terms of RFS, it was similar between reminiscence therapy group and control group. CONCLUSION: Reminiscence therapy cripples cognitive impairment, anxiety, and depression, but does not affect RFS in AIS patients, indicating its potential for post-stroke management.
