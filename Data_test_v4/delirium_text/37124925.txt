37124925|a|Mitochondria are the primary cellular energy generators, supplying the majority of adenosine triphosphate through oxidative phosphorylation, which is necessary for neuron function and survival. Mitophagy is the metabolic process of eliminating dysfunctional or redundant mitochondria. It is a type of autophagy and it is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial and neuronal health. Impaired mitophagy leads to an accumulation of damaged mitochondria and proteins leading to the dysregulation of mitochondrial quality control processes. Recent research shows the vital role of mitophagy in neurons and the pathogenesis of major neurodegenerative diseases. Mitophagy also plays a major role in the process of aging. This review describes the alterations that are being caused in the mitophagy process at the molecular level in aging and in neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's diseases and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also looks at how mitophagy can be exploited as a therapeutic target for these diseases.
