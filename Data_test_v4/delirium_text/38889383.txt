38889383|t|Association of Cardiovascular Health With Brain Age Estimated Using Machine Learning Methods in Middle-Aged and Older Adults.
38889383|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Cardiovascular health (CVH) has been associated with cognitive decline and dementia, but the extent to which CVH affects brain health remains unclear. We investigated the association of CVH, assessed using Life's Essential 8 (LE8), with neuroimaging-based brain age and brain-predicted age difference (brain-PAD). METHODS: This longitudinal community-based study was based on UK Biobank participants aged 40-69 years who were free from dementia and other neurologic diseases at baseline. LE8 score at baseline was assessed with 8 measures and tertiled as low, moderate, and high CVH. Structural and functional brain MRI scans were performed approximately 9 years after baseline, and 1,079 measures from 6 neuroimaging modalities were used to model brain age. A Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator regression model was trained in 4,355 healthy participants and then used to calculate brain age and brain-PAD in the whole population. Data were analyzed using linear regression models. RESULTS: The study included 32,646 participants (mean age at baseline 54.74 years; 53.44% female; mean LE8 score: 71.90). In multivariable-adjusted linear regression, higher LE8 score was associated with younger brain age (beta [95% CI] -0.037 [-0.043 to -0.031]) and more negative brain-PAD (beta [95% CI] -0.043 [-0.048 to -0.038]) (brain looks younger for chronological age). Compared with high CVH, low/moderate CVH was associated with older brain age (beta [95% CI] 1.030 [0.852-1.208]/0.475 [0.303-0.647]) and increased brain-PAD (beta [95% CI] 1.193 [1.029-1.357]/0.528 [0.370-0.686]). The associations between low CVH and older brain age/brain-PAD remained similar and significant in both middle-aged (beta [95% CI] 1.199 [0.992-1.405]/1.351 [1.159-1.542]) and older adults (beta [95% CI] 0.764 [0.417-1.110]/0.948 [0.632-1.263]). DISCUSSION: Low CVH is associated with older brain age and greater brain-PAD, even among middle-aged adults. Our findings suggest that optimizing CVH could support brain health. The main limitation of our study is that the study sample was healthier than the general population, thus caution is required when generalizing our findings to other populations.
