27272100|t|Peri- and postoperative cognitive and consecutive functional problems of elderly patients.
27272100|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: From an elderly patient's perspective, acute and chronic cognitive disturbances are among the most harmful complications that can occur following surgery. For elderly patients, these complications often mean the end of an independent life. This article focuses on this serious aspect, which is increasingly prevalent in our aging society. Cognitive disturbances are associated with severe outcome impairments and increased mortality. This article aims to provide a current overview regarding the diagnosis, pathophysiology, prevention, and treatment of this severe social problem. RECENT FINDINGS: The current knowledge of risk factors, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of postoperative delirium and postoperative cognitive dysfunction should help to raise awareness and improve the outcome of delirious patients, particularly in the elderly population. SUMMARY: Especially in elderly patients, postoperative delirium constitutes a common, severe complication. Early diagnosis and supportive treatment are essential to improve outcome. To date, no pharmacological treatment strategy was effective, so that further research about the underlying pathophysiology and the development of treatment strategies are urgently required.
