37828946|t|Sleep and critical illness: a review.
37828946|a|Critical illness and stays in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) have significant impact on sleep. Poor sleep is common in this setting, can persist beyond acute critical illness, and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. In the past 5 years, intensive care clinical practice guidelines have directed more focus on sleep and circadian disruption, spurring new initiatives to study and improve sleep complications in the critically ill. The global SARS-COV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic and dramatic spikes in patients requiring ICU level care also brought augmented levels of sleep disruption, the understanding of which continues to evolve. This review aims to summarize existing literature on sleep and critical illness and briefly discuss future directions in the field.
