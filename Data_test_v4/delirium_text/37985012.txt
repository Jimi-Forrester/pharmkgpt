37985012|a|AIM: This review aimed to evaluate factors associated with anaesthesia-related postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) among adults younger than 65 years who underwent cardiothoracic surgeries. STUDY DESIGN: A systematic keyword search, following the scoping review framework, was performed in the PubMed and CINAHL databases. Original English-language studies that included adults younger than 65 years and addressed cognitive function after surgery along with anaesthesia management were included. Retrospective studies, animal research and in vitro and in vivo studies were excluded. RESULTS: Twenty-three articles were included (65.2% interventional studies). All studies lacked theoretical or conceptual frameworks. Ketamine's neuroprotective potential is questionable, and intravenous lidocaine may be considered a possible early agent for preventing POCD, but long-term effectiveness is uncertain. Compared to inhalational anaesthesia, total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) may be related to a decreased incidence of POCD. Variation in POCD assessment impacted the lack of homogeneity in obtained data. Moreover, the shorter-term timing of POCD evaluation such as in early days after surgery could be greatly influenced by medication and delirium. CONCLUSION: Although strategies such as TIVA, the use of neuroprotective anaesthetics and comprehensive preoperative assessments are suggested to prevent POCD, this multifactorial phenomenon cannot be explicitly attributed solely to anaesthetics or anaesthesia-related techniques. Use of standardized, reliable and valid tools for POCD assessment is encouraged for cross-study comparison. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Nurses and certified nurse anaesthetists must be aware of risk factors for postoperative delirium and POCD so they can assess patients before and after surgery. Patients and caregivers need to be educated about cognitive changes after surgery and advised to report them to their health care provider if they occur.
