MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty-three patients with paranoid schizophrenia and 18 patients with AD were included in the study. Patients with schizophrenia were stratified into two subgroups by response to therapy. The indicators of the antioxidant profile were determined using methods based on chemiluminometry and spectrofluorimetry. RESULTS: Systemic oxidative stress due to insufficiency of low molecular weight plasma antioxidants is not determined neither in AD nor in treatment resistant schizophrenia. At the same time, a <<thiol>> oxidative stress, which indirectly indicates a deficiency of the glutathione system, is present in both groups. In patients with paranoid schizophrenia responsive to treatment, systemic oxidative stress is more pronounced and <<thiol>> oxidative stress is less significant. Among the antipsychotics studied, haloperidol, zuclopenthixol, risperidone and ziprasidone do not exhibit antioxidant properties, but periciazine, clozapine and especially chlorpromazine exhibit strong antioxidant properties, but they unlikely affect the antioxidant potential of blood plasma. CONCLUSIONS: The glutathione part of the antioxidant system is mostly affected, but systemic oxidative stress is not significant in patients with treatment resistant paranoid schizophrenia and AD. Oxidative disorders are more pronounced in treatment responsive paranoid schizophrenia.
