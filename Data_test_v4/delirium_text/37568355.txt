37568355|t|Cognitive Impairment in Cardiovascular Patients after Myocardial Infarction: Prospective Clinical Study.
37568355|a|(1) Background: Assessment of cognitive function is not routine in cardiac patients, and knowledge on the subject remains limited. The aim of this study was to assess post-myocardial infarction (MI) cognitive functioning in order to determine the frequency of cognitive impairment (CI) and to identify factors that may influence it. (2) Methods: A prospective study included 468 patients hospitalized for MI. Participants were assessed twice: during the first hospitalization and 6 months later. The Mini-Mental State Examination was used to assess the occurrence of CI. (3) Results: Cognitive dysfunction based on the MMSE was found in 37% (N-174) of patients during the first hospitalization. After 6 months, the prevalence of deficits decreased significantly to 25% (N-91) (p < 0.001). Patients with CI significantly differed from those without peri-infarction deficits in the GFR, BNP, ejection fraction and SYNTAX score, while after 6 months, significant differences were observed in LDL and HCT levels. There was a high prevalence of non-cognitive mental disorders among post-MI patients. (4) Conclusions: There is a high prevalence of CI and other non-cognitive mental disorders, such as depression, sleep disorders and a tendency to aggression, among post-MI patients. The analysis of the collected material indicates a significant impact of worse cardiac function expressed as EF and BNP, greater severity of coronary atherosclerosis expressed by SYNTAX results, and red blood cell parameters and LDL levels on the occurrence of CI in the post-MI patient population.
