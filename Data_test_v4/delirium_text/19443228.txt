19443228|t|Synthesis and structure-activity relationship of a novel series of heterocyclic sulfonamide gamma-secretase inhibitors.
19443228|a|gamma-Secretase inhibitors have been shown to reduce the production of beta-amyloid, a component of the plaques that are found in brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease. A novel series of heterocyclic sulfonamide gamma-secretase inhibitors that reduce beta-amyloid levels in cells is reported. Several examples of compounds within this series demonstrate a higher propensity to inhibit the processing of amyloid precursor protein compared to Notch, an alternative gamma-secretase substrate.
