35143668|t|Effect of Glucocorticoid and 11beta-Hydroxysteroid-Dehydrogenase Type 1 (11beta-HSD1) in Neurological and Psychiatric Disorders.
35143668|a|11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11beta-HSD1) activity is implicated as a moderator of the progression of multiple diseases and disorders in medicine and is actively subject to investigation as a therapeutic target. Here we summarize the mechanisms of the enzyme and detail the novel agents under investigation. Such agents modulate peripheral cortisol and cortisone levels in hypertension, type 2 diabetes, metabolic disorders, and Alzheimer's disease models, but there is mixed evidence for transduction into symptom management. There is inchoate evidence that 11beta-HSD1 modulators may be useful pharmacotherapies for clinical improvement in psychiatry and neurology; however, more research is required.
