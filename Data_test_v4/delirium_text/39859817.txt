39859817|a|The dynamically developing field of implantology requires researchers to search for new materials and solutions. In this study, TiNbZr samples were investigated as an alternative for popular, but potentially hazardous TiAl6V4. Samples were etched, sandblasted, subjected to PEO, and covered in AgNP suspension. Simultaneously, SEM images were taken, and the wettability and roughness of the surface were measured. Samples covered in AgNPs were subjected to biological trials. A six-day measurement of human fibroblast proliferation was conducted to assess biocompatibility, and the population of E. coli and S. aureus was measured over eight hours. Results showed that the TiNbZr PEO surface is biocompatible with human fibroblast cells and promotes growth. However, deposited AgNPs exhibited only slight effectiveness in decreasing bacterial growth over the first two hours. The results suggest that the method of surface preparation is sufficient and might promote osseointegration. On the other hand, more efficient and reliable methods of application of AgNPs should be researched.
