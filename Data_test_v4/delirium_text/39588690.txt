Here, we assessed the effects of restrictions on the cognitive function of the patients by comparing control group. METHODS: We examined the impact on cognitive function using the Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale (Japanese version) cognitive subscale (ADAS-JCOG), in patients with mild to moderate ADRD by a post hoc subgroup analysis of double-blinded, noninferiority study of donepezil 27.5 mg patches and donepezil hydrochloride 5 mg tablets (JapicCTI-194582). After demonstrating the noninferiority of both treatments, we used combined data for this analysis. RESULTS: The analyzed subpopulation of the per-protocol set groups was balanced (n=126 and 135, respectively). Patient demographics were similar between subgroups. The difference of ADAS-JCOG scores [least-squares mean (95%CI)] between the groups was 0.388 (-0.377 to 1.152, not statistically significant). CONCLUSION: Social isolation affects cognitive function on ADRD and this knowledge should be considered in future.
