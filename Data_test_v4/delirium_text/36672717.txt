36672717|a|The purpose of this study was to determine whether the age-related decline in a-series gangliosides (especially GM1), shown to be a factor in the brain-related etiology of Parkinson's disease (PD), also pertains to the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and aspects of PD unrelated to the central nervous system (CNS). Following Svennerholm's demonstration of the age-dependent decline in a-series gangliosides (both GM1 and GD1a) in the human brain, we previously demonstrated a similar decline in the normal mouse brain. The present study seeks to determine whether a similar a-series decline occurs in the periphery of normal mice as a possible prelude to the non-CNS symptoms of PD. We used mice of increasing age to measure a-series gangliosides in three peripheral tissues closely associated with PD pathology. Employing high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC), we found a substantial decrease in both GM1 and GD1a in all three tissues from 191 days of age. Motor and cognitive dysfunction were also shown to worsen, as expected, in synchrony with the decrease in GM1. Based on the previously demonstrated parallel between mice and humans concerning age-related a-series ganglioside decline in the brain, we propose the present findings to suggest a similar a-series decline in human peripheral tissues as the primary contributor to non-CNS pathologies of PD. An onset of sporadic PD would thus be seen as occurring simultaneously throughout the brain and body, albeit at varying rates, in association with the decline in a-series gangliosides. This would obviate the need to postulate the transfer of aggregated alpha-synuclein between brain and body or to debate brain vs. body as the origin of PD.
