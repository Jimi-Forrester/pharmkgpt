21648320|a|The role of lipids in the aetiology and progress of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is still unclear High lipid levels could be one of the risk factors for AD, but no association or even protective effects of high cholesterol levels in the development of the AD were also found. The aim of the study was to determine serum levels of total cholesterol, high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and triglycerides (TG) in female patients with AD and in healthy elderly controls. The 50 patients met the diagnostic criteria of probable AD according to the NINDS-ADRDA and DSM-IV criteria. Cognitive impairment was evaluated using the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE). Patients were subdivided into two groups of 19 patients in the middle (MMSE 10-19) and 31 patients in the late (MMSE 0-9) phase ofAD. Psychotic and non-psychotic features, evaluated by means of Neuropsychiatric Inventory, were presented in 13 and 37patients with AD, respectively. Control group consisted of 58 subjects without cognitive impairment (MMSE >27) and with lipid levels within normal range. Serum lipid levels were determined by the enzymatic colour tests and by the enzymatic clearance assay. Significantly lower lipid levels were found in patients with AD, than in controls. Patients in the late phase of AD had significantly lower entire lipid profile than controls and significantly lower cholesterol and LDL-C levels than patients in the middle stage ofAD. There was no difference in lipid levels between patients with and without psychotic features. The significant positive correlations were found between MMSE scores and cholesterol, LDL-C levels and age in all AD patients. The results support the presumption that lipid profile might be connected with the aetiology and progress of AD and showed the association between low serum cholesterol and LDL-C levels and cognitive decline in patients with AD. Further studies are needed to confirm the relationship between lipid levels and cognition, and to validate the lipid profile as a biological marker for the progress of AD.
