34198485|t|LncRSPH9-4 Facilitates Meningitic Escherichia coli-Caused Blood-Brain Barrier Disruption via miR-17-5p/MMP3 Axis.
34198485|a|Brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) constitute the structural and functional basis for the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and play essential roles in bacterial meningitis. Although the BBB integrity regulation has been under extensive investigation, there is little knowledge regarding the roles of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in this event. The present study aimed to investigate the roles of one potential lncRNA, lncRSPH9-4, in meningitic E. coli infection of BMECs. LncRSPH9-4 was cytoplasm located and significantly up-regulated in meningitic E. coli-infected hBMECs. Electrical cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) measurement and Western blot assay demonstrated lncRSPH9-4 overexpression in hBMECs mediated the BBB integrity disruption. By RNA-sequencing analysis, 639 mRNAs and 299 miRNAs were significantly differentiated in response to lncRSPH9-4 overexpression. We further found lncRSPH9-4 regulated the permeability in hBMECs by competitively sponging miR-17-5p, thereby increasing MMP3 expression, which targeted the intercellular tight junctions. Here we reported the infection-induced lncRSPH9-4 aggravated disruption of the tight junctions in hBMECs, probably through the miR-17-5p/MMP3 axis. This finding provides new insights into the function of lncRNAs in BBB integrity during meningitic E. coli infection and provides the novel nucleic acid targets for future treatment of bacterial meningitis.
