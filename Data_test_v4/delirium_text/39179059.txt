39179059|t|Harmony of Wnt Pathway in Alzheimer's: Navigating the Multidimensional progression from preclinical to clinical stages.
39179059|a|The Wnt pathway stands out as a pivotal signal transduction pathway, operating through two distinct modes of signaling: the canonical/beta-catenin pathway and the non-canonical pathway. Among these, the canonical pathway assumes a paramount role in various physiological and pathological processes within the human body. Particularly in the brain, Wnt exhibits involvement in fundamental physiological events including neuronal differentiation/survival, axonogenesis, neural stem cell regulation, synaptic plasticity, and cell cycle modulation. Notably, scientific evidence underscores the critical role of the Wnt pathway in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), correlating with its involvement in key pathological features such as tau tangles, Amyloid-beta plaques, synaptic dysfunction, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, cognitive impairments, and disruption of the blood-brain barrier integrity. This review aims to comprehensively explore the involvement and significance of Wnt signaling in Alzheimer's. Furthermore, it delves into recent advancements in research on Wnt signaling, spanning from preclinical investigations to clinical trials.
