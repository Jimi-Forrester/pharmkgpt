38429778|a|BACKGROUND: Inflammation has an important role in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. The aim of this study was to investigate the levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) in male patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS) and chronic medicated schizophrenia (CMS), and the relationship with psychopathology. METHODS: The study enrolled 31 TRS and 49 cm male patients, and 53 healthy controls. Serum MMP-2 and TNF-alpha levels were measured by the Luminex liquid suspension chip detection method. Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) scores were used to evaluate symptom severity and Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status was used to assess cognitive function. RESULTS: Serum TNF-alpha and MMP-2 levels differed significantly between TRS, CMS and healthy control patients (F = 4.289, P = 0.016; F = 4.682, P = 0.011, respectively). Bonferroni correction demonstrated that serum TNF-alpha levels were significantly elevated in CMS patients (P = 0.022) and MMP-2 levels were significantly higher in TRS patients (P = 0.014) compared to healthy controls. In TRS patients, TNF-alpha was negatively correlated with age (r=-0.435, P = 0.015) and age of onset (r=-0.409, P = 0.022). In CMS patients, MMP-2 and TNF-alpha were negatively correlated with PANSS negative and total scores, and TNF-alpha was negatively correlated with PANSS general psychopathology scores (all P < 0.05). MMP-2 levels were positively correlated with TNF-alpha levels (P < 0.05), but not with cognitive function (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: The results indicate the involvement of inflammation in the etiology of TRS and CMS. Further studies are warranted.
