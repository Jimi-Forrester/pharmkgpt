28619181|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, ranking only behind Alzheimer's disease and affecting 2% of the population over the age of 65. Pathophysiologically, PD is characterized by selective degeneration of the dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and striatal dopamine depletion. Patients may also exhibit mild-to-severe degeneration of other central and peripheral nervous tissues. The most dramatic symptoms of the disease are profound dopamine-responsive motor disturbances, including bradykinesia, akinesia, rigidity, resting tremor, and postural instability. PD patients commonly present with debilitating non-motor symptoms, including cognitive impairment, autonomic nervous system dysfunction, and sleep disturbance. Of these, sleep disturbance is the most consistently reported, and likely represents a disorder integrative of PD-related motor impairment, autonomic nervous system dysfunction, iatrogenic insult, and central neurodegeneration. The pathophysiology of PD may also indirectly disrupt sleep by increasing susceptibility to sleep disorders, including sleep disordered breathing, periodic limb movements, and REM behavior disorder. In this review, we will discuss these systems representing a multifactorial etiology in PD sleep disturbance.
