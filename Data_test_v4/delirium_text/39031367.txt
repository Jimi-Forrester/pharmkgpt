39031367|a|Background: The Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination-Revised (ACE-R) is an accessible cognitive tool that supports the early detection of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD). Objective: To investigate the diagnostic efficacy of the ACE-R in MCI, AD, and bvFTD through the identification of novel coefficients for differentiation between these diseases. Methods: We assessed 387 individuals: 102 mild AD, 37 mild bvFTD, 87 with amnestic MCI patients, and 161 cognitively unimpaired controls. The Mokken scaling technique facilitated the extraction out of the 26 ACE-R items that exhibited a common latent trait, thereby generating the Mokken scales for the AD group and the MCI group. Subsequently, we performed logistic regression, integrating each Mokken scales with sociodemographic factors, to differentiate between AD and bvFTD, as well as between AD or MCI and control groups. Ultimately, the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve analysis was employed to assess the efficacy of the coefficient's discrimination. Results: The AD-specific Mokken scale (AD-MokACE-R) versus bvFTD exhibited an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.922 (88% sensitivity and specificity). The AD-MokACE-R versus controls achieved an AUC of 0.968 (93% sensitivity, 94% specificity). The MCI-specific scale (MCI-MokACE-R) versus controls demonstrated an AUC of 0.859 (78% sensitivity, 79% specificity). Conclusions: The ACE-R's capacity is enhanced through statistical methods and demographic integration, allowing for accurate differentiation between AD and bvFTD, as well as between MCI and controls. This new method not only reinforces its clinical value in early diagnosis but also surpasses traditional approaches noted in prior studies.
