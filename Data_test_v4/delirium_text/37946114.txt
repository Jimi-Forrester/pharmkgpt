37946114|a|The latest clinical trials have reported conflicting outcomes regarding the effectiveness of xenon anesthesia in preventing postoperative neurocognitive dysfunction; thus, this study assessed the existing evidence. We searched the PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases from inception to April 9, 2023, for randomized controlled trials of xenon anesthesia in postoperative patients. We included English-language randomized controlled studies of adult patients undergoing surgery with xenon anesthesia that compared its effects to those of other anesthetics. Duplicate studies, pediatric studies, and ongoing clinical trials were excluded. Nine studies with 754 participants were identified. A forest plot revealed that the incidence of postoperative neurocognitive dysfunction did not differ between the xenon anesthesia and control groups (P = 0.43). Additionally, xenon anesthesia significantly shortened the emergence time for time to opening eyes (P < 0.001), time to extubation (P < 0.001), time to react on demand (P = 0.01), and time to time and spatial orientation (P = 0.04). However, the Aldrete score significantly increased with xenon anesthesia (P = 0.005). Postoperative complications did not differ between the anesthesia groups. Egger's test for bias showed no small-study effect, and a trim-and-fill analysis showed no apparent publication bias. In conclusion, xenon anesthesia probably did not affect the occurrence of postoperative neurocognitive dysfunction. However, xenon anesthesia may effectively shorten the emergence time of certain parameters without adverse effects.
