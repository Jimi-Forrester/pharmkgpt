Over 50% suffer sleep-wake disturbances (SWDs) months after discharge. Given the importance of sleep to brain repair, we hypothesized that SWD would be associated with poorer health-related quality of life (HRQOL). METHODS: Cross-sectional analysis of prospectively collected data in children with ABI aged 3 to 18 years evaluated 1 to 3 months after critical care hospitalization (N = 151). SWD measured by Sleep Disturbances Scale for Children and defined as T-score >=60 signifying moderate-severe risk of sleep disorders. HRQOL measured by Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory, which defines minimal clinically important difference as 4.5 points in total score. Secondary outcomes included scores for Physical, Emotional, Social, and School Function domains. SWD groups were compared with Mann-Whitney tests. Multiple linear regression evaluated association between SWD and HRQOL controlling for patient and ABI characteristics. Significance was defined as P < 0.05. RESULTS: SWDs were present in 66% (n = 100). HRQOL total score was significantly lower in children with SWD (median = 70; interquartile range [IQR] = 54, 80) versus without (median = 85; IQR = 67, 94; P < 0.001). Median scores in emotional, social, and school domains were significantly lower in SWD group (all P < 0.01). When controlling for age, sex, critical care interventions, preadmission comorbidities, and decline from preadmission Functional Status Scale, presence of SWD significantly reduced HRQOL total score nearly three times minimal clinically important difference (beta-coefficient = -12.1; 95% confidence Interval = -17.9, -6.2). CONCLUSIONS: SWD following ABI significantly decreased HRQOL overall and across multiple health domains. Sleep is potentially modifiable. Our data support future studies targeting sleep to improve outcomes after ABI.
