39422937|t|Advances and Challenges in Gene Therapy for Alzheimer's Disease.
39422937|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline, memory loss, and behavioral impairments. Despite extensive research efforts, effective treatment options for AD remain limited. Recently, gene therapy has emerged as a promising avenue for targeted intervention in the pathogenesis of AD. This review will provide an overview of clinical and preclinical studies where gene therapy techniques have been utilized in the context of AD, highlighting their potential as novel therapeutic strategies. While challenges remain, ongoing research and technological advancement continue to enhance the potential of gene therapy as a targeted and personalized therapeutic approach for AD.
