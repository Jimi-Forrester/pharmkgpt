38577607|t|Safety and Efficacy Analysis of Radical Surgery for 403 Patients with Colon Cancer over 80 Years Old.
38577607|a|Aim: To investigate the safety and efficacy of radical surgery in colon cancer patients over 80 years old. Methods: Data from colon cancer patients aged >=80 years who underwent radical surgery at the Cancer Hospital of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and affiliated Heji Hospital of Changzhi Medical College from January 2011 to December 2022 were retrospectively analysed. Data on clinical characteristics, pathological features, perioperative data, and long-term prognosis were collected. Severe complications were classified as grade III-V. Logistic regression models were used to identify the risk factors for severe postoperative complications, and a Cox regression model was used to determine prognostic variables. Results: A total of 403 eligible patients were included in the study. A total of 118 (29.3%) patients developed postoperative complications, of which 51 (12.7%) experienced grade 3-5 severe complications. Two (0.5%) patients died of pulmonary embolism and myocardial infarction during the perioperative period. The multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that preoperative albumin levels <35 g/L and right colon cancer were independent risk factors for grade 3-5 postoperative complications. In terms of prognosis, multivariate analysis revealed that overall survival was significantly affected by TNM stage III and grade 3-4 postoperative complications. In addition, TNM stage III and perineural invasion were the independent prognostic factors for disease-free survival. Conclusion: Radical surgery can be performed safely in elderly colon cancer patients aged over 80 years, with an acceptable morbidity and mortality. Patients with preoperative albumin levels <35 g/L or tumors in the right colon should be alerted to the development of severe postoperative complications. In addition, the occurrence of severe complications can significantly affect the prognosis of elderly colon cancer patients.
