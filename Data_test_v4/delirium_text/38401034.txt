38401034|a|BACKGROUND: Prolonged intensive care unit (ICU) stay is associated with physical, cognitive, and psychological disabilities. The impact of baseline frailty on long-stay ICU patients remains uncertain. This study aims to investigate how baseline frailty influences mortality and post-ICU disability 6 months after critical illness in long-stay ICU patients. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we assessed patients hospitalized for >= 7 days in the ICU between May 2018 and May 2021, following them for up to 6 months or until death. Based on the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) at ICU admissions, patients were categorized as frail (CFS >= 5), pre-frail (CFS 3-4) and non-frail (CFS 1-2). Kaplan-Meier curves and a multivariate Cox model were used to examine the association between frailty and mortality. At the 6 month follow-up, we assessed psychological, physical, cognitive outcomes, and health-related quality of life (QoL) using descriptive statistics and linear regressions. RESULTS: We enrolled 531 patients, of which 178 (33.6%) were frail, 200 (37.6%) pre-frail and 153 (28.8%) non-frail. Frail patients were older, had more comorbidities, and greater disease severity at ICU admission. At 6 months, frail patients presented higher mortality rates than pre-frail and non-frail patients (34.3% (61/178) vs. 21% (42/200) vs. 13.1% (20/153) respectively, p < 0.01). The rate of withdrawing or withholding of care did not differ significantly between the groups. Compared with CFS 1-2, the adjusted hazard ratios of death at 6 months were 1.7 (95% CI 0.9-2.9) for CFS 3-4 and 2.9 (95% CI 1.7-4.9) for CFS >= 5. At 6 months, 192 patients were seen at a follow-up consultation. In multivariate linear regressions, CFS >= 5 was associated with poorer physical health-related QoL, but not with poorer mental health-related QoL, compared with CFS 1-2. CONCLUSION: Frailty is associated with increased mortality and poorer physical health-related QoL in long-stay ICU patients at 6 months. The admission CFS can help inform patients and families about the complexities of survivorship during a prolonged ICU stay.
