15337114|a|Disorders of taste and smell can present a challenge to the facial plastic surgeon. Obtaining a detailed history and examination is the key to the diagnosis and work-up of olfactory and gustatory dysfunction. Easy-to-administer tests are available for olfactory evaluation(University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test) and gustatory (taste sticks, tasting tablets) evaluation. The prognosis and management of olfactory and gustatory disease depend on its etiology. Despite ongoing research, the treatment of the disorders of smell and taste is limited.
