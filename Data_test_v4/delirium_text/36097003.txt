36097003|a|One of the major challenges for discovering protein-protein interaction inhibitors is identifying selective and druggable binding sites at the protein surface. Here, we report an approach to identify a small molecular binding site to selectively inhibit the interaction of soluble RANKL and RANK for designing anti-osteoporosis drugs without undesirable immunosuppressive effects. Through molecular dynamic simulations, we discovered a binding site that allows a small molecule to selectively interrupt soluble RANKL-RANK interaction and without interfering with the membrane RANKL-RANK interaction. We describe a highly potent inhibitor, S3-15, and demonstrate its specificity to inhibit the soluble RANKL-RANK interaction with in vitro and in vivo studies. S3-15 exhibits anti-osteoporotic effects without causing immunosuppression. Through in silico and in vitro experiments we further confirm the binding model of S3-15 and soluble RANKL. This work might inspire structure-based drug discovery for targeting protein-protein interactions.
