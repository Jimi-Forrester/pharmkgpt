31243597|t|Diffusion tensor imaging reveals abnormal brain networks in elderly subjects with subjective cognitive deficits.
31243597|a|PURPOSE: Some elders with subjective cognitive deficits (SCD) develop prodromal phase of dementia over time; however, little is known about how they differ from those with normal cognition (NC). Thus, we aim to distinguish the differences in the brain network of elders with SCD and NC. METHODS: Multiple diffusion-weighted images (DWI) and T1-weighted images were obtained from 18 subjects with NC and 26 subjects with SCD. Using network-based statistics (NBS) analysis, we extracted abnormal brain subnetworks and localized abnormal brain connectivity. We also ran correlation analysis to compare the affected regions and the results of the neurocognitive assessments. RESULTS: Altered subnetworks were found in the superior parietal gyrus, angular gyrus, precuneus, posterior cingulum, putamen, precentral gyrus, postcentral gyrus, and paracentral lobule. They were also associated with scores on the word list recall, word list recognition, and Boston naming test. CONCLUSIONS: Elders with SCD had distinctive brain network alterations when compared with those of elders with NC. The results are also in line with the previously identified characteristics of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in a milder form. We speculate that it may be possible to predict AD progression early in the SCD stage using NBS analysis.
