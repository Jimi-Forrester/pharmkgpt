34067629|t|Tissue-Nonspecific Alkaline Phosphatase in Central Nervous System Health and Disease: A Focus on Brain Microvascular Endothelial Cells.
34067629|a|Tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP) is an ectoenzyme bound to the plasma membranes of numerous cells via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) moiety. TNAP's function is well-recognized from earlier studies establishing its important role in bone mineralization. TNAP is also highly expressed in cerebral microvessels; however, its function in brain cerebral microvessels is poorly understood. In recent years, few studies have begun to delineate a role for TNAP in brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs)-a key component of cerebral microvessels. This review summarizes important information on the role of BMEC TNAP, and its implication in health and disease. Furthermore, we discuss current models and tools that may assist researchers in elucidating the function of TNAP in BMECs.
