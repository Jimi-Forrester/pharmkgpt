35083455|t|Mouse modeling for anxiety disorders in older adults.
35083455|a|Anxiety disorders are common in older adults and are strongly associated with increased risk for numerous age-related conditions. Preclinical mechanistic data are needed to identify more specific therapeutic targets for treating and preventing these disorders. Mice serve as excellent preclinical models as they have been used extensively in aging studies, and behavioral tests have been developed. A panel of tests would capture the important clinical aspects of apathy, anxiety, and psychomotor behavior and allow longitudinal testing strategies in a rigorous and minimally stressful manner.
