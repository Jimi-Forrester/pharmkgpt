37575825|t|Extensive Soft Tissue Swelling in the Larynx and Hypopharynx of a Young Female Patient After Haloperidol Use: A Case Report on Angioneurotic Edema.
37575825|a|Angioneurotic edema is a potentially life-threatening condition characterized by the rapid swelling of subcutaneous and submucosal tissues of the upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. It may result in laryngeal edema, thus obstructing the airway, with a potentially fatal outcome if not diagnosed early. An allergic reaction typically causes it, but certain drugs can induce or contribute to the development of angioneurotic edema in rare cases. Haloperidol is one of the most commonly used antipsychotics to treat psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and, in the emergency room, acute delirium and acute psychosis. While it is generally well tolerated, in rare cases, individuals may experience a severe reaction in response to haloperidol administration. Here, we present the case of angioneurotic edema associated with intramuscular haloperidol use in a 29-year-old female patient with a history of bipolar disorder and no previous history of allergy. This case report aims to raise awareness among clinicians about this rare adverse reaction associated with haloperidol use.
