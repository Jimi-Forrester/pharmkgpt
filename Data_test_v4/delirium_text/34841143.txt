34841143|t|Quench-Release-Based Fluorescent Immunosensor for the Rapid Detection of Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha.
34841143|a|Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) is used as a biomarker for the diagnosis of various inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. In recent years, numerous approaches have been used for the qualitative and quantitative analyses of TNF-alpha. However, these methods have several drawbacks, such as a tedious and time-consuming process, high pH and temperature sensitivity, and increased chances of denaturation in vitro. Quenchbody (Q-body) is a fluorescence immunoprobe that functions based on the principle of photoinduced electron transfer and has been successful in detecting various substances. In this study, we constructed two Q-bodies based on a therapeutic antibody, adalimumab, to rapidly detect human TNF-alpha. Both sensors could detect TNF-alpha within 5 min. The results showed that the limit of detection (LOD) of TNF-alpha was as low as 0.123 ng/mL with a half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) of 25.0 ng/mL using the TAMRA-labeled Q-body, whereas the ATTO520-labeled Q-body had a LOD of 0.419 ng/mL with an EC50 of 65.6 ng/mL, suggesting that the Q-bodies could rapidly detect TNF-alpha with reasonable sensitivity over a wide detection range. These biosensors will be useful tools for the detection and monitoring of inflammatory biomarkers.
