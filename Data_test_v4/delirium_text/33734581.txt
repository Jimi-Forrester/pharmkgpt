33734581|a|INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating condition with no effective treatments, with promising findings in rodents failing to translate into successful therapies for patients. METHODS: Targeting the vulnerable entorhinal cortex (ERC), rhesus monkeys received two injections of an adeno-associated virus expressing a double tau mutation (AAV-P301L/S320F) in the left hemisphere, and control AAV-green fluorescent protein in the right ERC. Noninjected aged-matched monkeys served as additional controls. RESULTS: Within 3 months we observed evidence of misfolded tau propagation, similar to what is hypothesized to occur in humans. Viral delivery of human 4R-tau also coaptates monkey 3R-tau via permissive templating. Tau spreading is accompanied by robust neuroinflammatory response driven by TREM2+ microglia, with biomarkers of inflammation and neuronal loss in the cerebrospinal fluid and plasma. DISCUSSION: These results highlight the initial stages of tau seeding and propagation in a primate model, a more powerful translational approach for the development of new therapies for AD.
