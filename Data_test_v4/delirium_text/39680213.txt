39680213|t|Whole exome sequencing reveals heparan sulfate proteoglycan 2 (HSPG2) as a potential causative gene for kidney stone disease in a Thai family.
39680213|a|Kidney stone disease (KSD) is a prevalent and complex condition, with an incidence of 85 cases per 100,000 individuals in Thailand. Notably, over 40% of cases are concentrated in the northeastern region, indicating a potential genetic influence, which is supported by genetic mutations reported in several families by our research group. Despite this, the genetic basis of KSD remains largely unknown for many Thai families. This study aimed to identify the genetic mutation responsible for KSD in a specific Thai family, the UBRS131 family, which includes four affected individuals. Whole exome sequencing was performed, and variant filtering using the VarCards2 program identified 10 potentially causative mutations across 9 genes. These mutations were subjected to segregation analysis among family members and screened in 180 control and 179 case samples using real-time PCR-HRM or PCR-RFLP techniques. Prioritization of these variants using GeneDistiller identified the p.Asp775Glu mutation in the heparan sulfate proteoglycan 2 (HSPG2) gene as the likely causative mutation for KSD in this family. The Asp775 residue is highly conserved across vertebrates, and structural analysis suggests that the Glu775 substitution may disrupt the formation of two crucial hydrogen bonds, potentially altering the mutant protein's configuration. Immunohistochemistry confirmed the presence of perlecan (HSPG2 protein) in the proximal tubules in nephrons. These findings highlight the significant role of the HSPG2 gene in familial KSD within this study family.
