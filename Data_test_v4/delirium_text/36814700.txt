36814700|t|The Seoul Neuropsychological Screening Battery (SNSB) for Comprehensive Neuropsychological Assessment.
36814700|a|The Seoul Neuropsychological Screening Battery (SNSB) is known as a representative comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation tool in Korea since its first standardization in 2003. It was the main neuropsychological evaluation tool in the Clinical Research Center for Dementia of South Korea, a large-scale multi-center cohort study in Korea that was started in 2005. Since then, it has been widely used by dementia clinicians, and further solidified its status as a representative dementia evaluation tool in Korea. Many research results related to the SNSB have been used as a basis for the diagnosis and evaluation of patients in various clinical settings, especially, in many areas of cognitive assessment, including dementia evaluation. The SNSB version that was updated in 2012 provides psychometrically improved norms and indicators through a model-based standardization procedure based on a theoretical probability distribution in the norm's development. By providing a score for each cognitive domain, it is easier to compare cognitive abilities between domains and to identify changes in cognitive domain functions over time. Through the development of the SNSB-Core, a short form composed of core tests, which also give a composite score was provided. The SNSB is a useful test battery that provides key information on the evaluation of early cognitive decline, analysis of cognitive decline patterns, judging the severity of dementia, and differential diagnosis of dementia. This review will provide a broad understanding of the SNSB by describing the test composition, contents of individual subtests, characteristics of standardization, analysis of the changed standard score, and related studies.
