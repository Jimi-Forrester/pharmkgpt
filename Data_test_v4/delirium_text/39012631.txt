39012631|t|Alzheimer Disease and Related Dementia Following Hormone-Modulating Therapy in Patients With Breast Cancer.
39012631|a|Importance: Hormone-modulating therapy (HMT) is a widely accepted treatment for hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, although its cognitive effects, including a potential link to Alzheimer disease and related dementias (ADRD), remain understudied. Objective: To investigate the association between HMT for breast cancer treatment and risk of developing ADRD in women aged 65 years or older. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study used a comprehensive dataset from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare linked database to identify patients who did and did not receive HMT treatment within 3 years after the initial diagnosis of breast cancer and assessed their risk of developing ADRD in later life. Individuals with a preexisting diagnosis of ADRD or receiving HMT before the diagnosis of breast cancer were excluded. This study was performed from June 2022 through January 2024. Exposure: Receipt of HMT. Main Outcomes and Measures: Risk of ADRD associated with HMT; associations of risk with age, self-identified race, and HMT type. Risk was measured using hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs and adjusted for potential confounders such as demographic, sociocultural, and clinical variables. Results: Among 18 808 women aged 65 years and older diagnosed with breast cancer between 2007 and 2009 (1266 Black [6.7%], 16 526 White [87.9%], 1016 other [5.4%]), 12 356 (65.7%) received HMT within 3 years after diagnosis, while 6452 (34.3%) did not. The most common age group in both samples was the 75 to 79 years age group (HMT, 2721 women [22.0%]; no HMT, 1469 women [22.8%]), and the majority of women in both groups self-identified as White (HMT, 10 904 women [88.3%]; no HMT, 5622 women [87.1%]). During an average of 12 years of follow-up, 2926 (23.7%) of HMT users and 1802 (27.9%) of non-HMT users developed ADRD. HMT was associated with a 7% lower relative risk of ADRD overall (HR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.88-0.98; P = .005). The association decreased with age and varied by race. The reduction in ADRD risk associated with HMT was greatest for women aged 65 to 74 years who self-identified as Black (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.62-0.92). This association decreased among women aged 75 years or older (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.67-0.98). Women aged 65 to 74 years who self-identified as White had an 11% relative risk reduction (HR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.81-0.97), but the association disappeared for women aged 75 years or older (HR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.90-1.02). Other races showed no significant association between HMT and ADRD. Age- and race-based associations also varied by HMT type. Conclusions and Relevance: In this retrospective cohort study, hormone therapy was associated with protection against ADRD in women aged 65 years or older with newly diagnosed breast cancer; the decrease in risk was relatively greater for Black women and women under age 75 years, while the protective effect of HMT diminished with age and varied by race in women. When deciding to use HMT for breast cancer in women aged 65 years or more, clinicians should consider age, self-identified race, and HMT type in treatment decisions.
