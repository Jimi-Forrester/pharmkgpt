33030131|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Hypoxic Preconditioning (HPC) has been well established to trigger endogenous mechanisms of neuroprotection basing on models of hypoxic and ischemic diseases in the Central Nervous System (CNS). However, its effects against Alzheimer's Disease (AD) still lack substantial evidence and in-depth exploration. The present study aimed to investigate the impacts of HPC on AD-related memory decline and amyloid-beta (Abeta) pathology in AbetaPP/PS1 transgenic mice. METHODS: Seven-week-old AbetaPP/PS1 transgenic mice were randomized into HPC and non-HPC groups. The HPC groups were treated with early and repetitive HPC for four weeks, while the non-HPC group was raised under normoxia condition. All the animals were then raised until the age of 28 weeks when Morris water maze tests were conducted to examine the animals' spatial memory. Indicators for Abeta pathology (soluble Abeta levels and numbers of Abeta plaques) and the expression of relevant proteins were measured to explore potential mechanisms. RESULTS: The results showed that HPC ameliorated memory decline and Abeta pathology in AbetaPP/PS1 mice. The protein levels of Amyloid-beta Precursor Protein (AbetaPP) and beta-site APP Cleaving Enzyme 1 (BACE1) were reduced while that of Hypoxic inducible factor 1alpha (HIF-1alpha) was elevated in HPC groups. CONCLUSION: HPC might be a promising strategy for AD intervention. Its potential protection might be realized via downregulating the expressions of AbetaPP and BACE1 and hence inhibiting Abeta pathology. Notably, HIF-1alpha might play a key role in mediating subsequent neuroadaptive changes following HPC.
