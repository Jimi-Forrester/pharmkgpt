39063135|t|Nucleic Acids-Based Biomarkers for Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis and Novel Molecules to Treat the Disease.
39063135|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) represents the most common form of dementia and affects million people worldwide, with a high social burden and considerable economic costs. AD diagnosis benefits from a well-established panel of laboratory tests that allow ruling-in patients, along with FDG and amyloid PET imaging tools. The main laboratory tests used to identify AD patients are Abeta40, Abeta42, the Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio, phosphorylated Tau 181 (pTau181) and total Tau (tTau). Although they are measured preferentially in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), some evidence about the possibility for blood-based determination to enter clinical practice is growing up. Unfortunately, CSF biomarkers for AD and, even more, the blood-based ones, present a few flaws, and twenty years of research in this field did not overcome these pitfalls. The tale even worsens when the issue of treating AD is addressed due to the lack of effective strategies despite the many decades of attempts by pharmaceutic industries and scientists. Amyloid-based drugs failed to stop the disease, and no neuroinflammation-based drugs have been demonstrated to work so far. Hence, only symptomatic therapy is available, with no disease-modifying treatment on hand. Such a desolate situation fully justifies the active search for novel biomarkers to be used as reliable tests for AD diagnosis and molecular targets for treating patients. Recently, a novel group of molecules has been identified to be used for AD diagnosis and follow-up, the nuclei acid-based biomarkers. Nucleic acid-based biomarkers are a composite group of extracellular molecules consisting of DNA and RNA alone or in combination with other molecules, including proteins. This review article reports the main findings from the studies carried out on these biomarkers during AD, and highlights their advantages and limitations.
