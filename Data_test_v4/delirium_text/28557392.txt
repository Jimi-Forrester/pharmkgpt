28557392|a|The review has described melatonin as a prognostic marker of invasive and non-invasive diagnostic of organism aging time and age-related pathology. Decreasing of melatonin level in buccal cells has correlated with patient age. Melatonin level in patients with Alzheimer disease has decreased. Melatonin level in blood plasma has correlated with severity of menopausal syndrome. Melatonin secretion in enterocytes increased during gastric ulcer. In oncology patients was described changes of 6-COMT - metabolite of melatonin in urine in dependent of histology type and stage of disease. Thus, melatonin is the molecular marker, which characterized integral processes in neuro-immuno-endocrine system and can be verified by non-invasive methods in peripheral tissues and biological fluids of organism.
