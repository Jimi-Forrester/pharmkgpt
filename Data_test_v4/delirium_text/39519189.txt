39519189|a|Neuroinflammation, characterised by the activation of immune cells in the central nervous system (CNS), plays a dual role in both protecting against and contributing to the progression of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and multiple sclerosis (MS). This review explores the role of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), a key enzyme involved in cellular survival, proliferation, and inflammatory responses, within the context of neuroinflammation. Two PI3K isoforms of interest, PI3Kgamma and PI3Kdelta, are specific to the regulation of CNS cells, such as microglia, astrocytes, neurons, and oligodendrocytes, influencing pathways, such as Akt, mTOR, and NF-kappaB, that control cytokine production, immune cell activation, and neuroprotection. The dysregulation of PI3K signalling is implicated in chronic neuroinflammation, contributing to the exacerbation of neurodegenerative diseases. Preclinical studies show promise in targeting neuronal disorders using PI3K inhibitors, such as AS605240 (PI3Kgamma) and idelalisib (PI3Kdelta), which have reduced inflammation, microglial activation, and neuronal death in in vivo models of AD. However, the clinical translation of these inhibitors faces challenges, including blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, isoform specificity, and long-term safety concerns. This review highlights the therapeutic potential of PI3K modulation in neuroinflammatory diseases, identifying key gaps in the current research, particularly in the need for brain-penetrating and isoform-specific inhibitors. These findings underscore the importance of future research to develop targeted therapies that can effectively modulate PI3K activity and provide neuroprotection in chronic neurodegenerative disorders.
