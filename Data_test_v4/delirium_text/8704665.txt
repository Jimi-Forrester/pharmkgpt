8704665|a|The immediate post-hospitalization outcomes for elderly individuals who received home health services after discharge were compared with those who did not receive home health services. The needs of individuals with cognitive impairment and the "old-old" were major foci of interest. Assessment instruments included the Mini-Mental State Exam, the Delirium Symptom Interview, and the Everyday Problem Solving Test. Data on the use of health services after hospital discharge were collected. Results showed that patients age 80 and older, who received skilled nursing services, were less likely to report health problems or complications than those who had not received skilled nursing services. Because the old-old elderly are more likely to have problems during the immediate post-hospitalization period, this group of patients should be targeted for needs assessment and discharge planning.
