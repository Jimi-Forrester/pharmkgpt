35897906|t|Neocornuside A-D, Four Novel Iridoid Glycosides from Fruits of Cornus officinalis and Their Antidiabetic Activity.
35897906|a|Four previously undescribed iridoid glycosides neocornuside A-D (1-4), along with six known ones (5-10), were isolated from Cornus officinalis fruit. Their structures were elucidated by extensive spectroscopic (NMR, UV, IR, and MS) analysis and comparison with data reported in the literature. All isolates were assessed for their antidiabetic activity on the relative glucose consumption in insulin-induced insulin-resistant HepG2 cells. The results showed that compounds 1, 3, and 7 exhibited significant antidiabetic activities with EC50 values of 0.582, 1.275, and 0.742 muM, respectively. Moreover, compounds 1, 3, and 7 could improve the ability of 2-NBDG uptake of insulin-induced HepG2 cells.
