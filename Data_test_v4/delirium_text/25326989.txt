25326989|a|Severe burns and their treatment are among the most painful experiences a person can have. Emotional needs of burn patients have long been overshadowed by the focus on survival. Today, when the survival rate is much higher than in the past, the need of psychological and psychosocial engagement in working with victims of severe burns has emerged. A patient undergoing various stages of adjustment is faced with emotional challenges that accompany physical recovery. Adapting to burn injury involves a complex interplay between patient characteristics before the occurrence of burn, environmental factors, and the nature of the burns and medical care required. Adaptation implies adoption of new ideas about themselves and their body, new body image and new self image. Psychiatric and psychological treatment must be incorporated in burn treatment centers within a multidisciplinary treatment team. Psychology and psychotherapy should address the problem of loss, grief, acceptance of body image and self image, in terms of psychiatric conditions of delirium, acute stress disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, anxiety, depression and other psychiatric disorders. Technical assistance and support should be provided to the patient family members. In some cases, psychosocial treatment never ends; it takes years, later related to rehabilitated burns.
