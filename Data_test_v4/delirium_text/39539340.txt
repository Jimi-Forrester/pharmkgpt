39539340|t|Circadian rhythm disruption: a potential trigger in Parkinson's disease pathogenesis.
39539340|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the gradual loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc), abnormal accumulation of alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn), and activation of microglia leading to neuroinflammation. Disturbances in circadian rhythm play a significant role in PD, with most non-motor symptoms associated with disruptions in circadian rhythm. These disturbances can be observed years before motor symptoms appear and are marked by the emergence of non-motor symptoms related to PD, such as rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD), restless leg syndrome (RLS), excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), depression and anxiety, changes in blood pressure, gastrointestinal dysfunction, and urinary problems. Circadian rhythm disruption precedes the onset of motor symptoms and contributes to the progression of PD. In brief, this article outlines the role of circadian rhythm disruption in triggering PD at cellular and molecular levels, as well as its clinical manifestations. It also explores how circadian rhythm research can contribute to preventing the onset and progression of PD from current and future perspectives.
