29971141|t|Standardised Neuropsychological Assessment for the Selection of Patients Undergoing DBS for Parkinson's Disease.
29971141|a|DBS is an increasingly offered advanced treatment for Parkinson's disease (PD). Neuropsychological assessment is considered to be an important part of the screening for selection of candidates for this treatment. However, no standardised screening procedure currently exists. In this study, we examined the use of our standardised neuropsychological assessment for the evaluation of surgical candidates and to identify risk factors for subsequent decline in cognition and mood. A total of 40 patients were assessed before and after DBS. Evaluation of mood and case notes review was also undertaken. Before DBS, patients with PD demonstrated frequent impairments in intellectual functioning, memory, attention, and executive function, as well as high rates of mood disorder. Post-DBS, there was a general decline in verbal fluency only, and in one patient, we documented an immediate and irreversible global cognitive decline, which was associated with older age and more encompassing cognitive deficits at baseline. Case note review revealed that a high proportion of patients developed mood disorder, which was associated with higher levels of depression at baseline and greater reduction in levodopa medication. We conclude that our neuropsychological assessment is suitable for the screening of candidates and can identify baseline risk factors, which requires careful consideration before and after surgery.
