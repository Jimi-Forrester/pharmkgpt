In the period between September 2020 and June 2021, a weekly average of 114 SARS-CoV-2 infections were recorded in Forli-Cesena province (north of Italy), with a maximum of 330 cases per week in March 2021; in the same months, the Internal Medicine Unit of Cesena M. Bufalini Hospital managed 954 COVID-19 patients. To allow the management of these patients, the ward was divided into areas at different intensity of care, with a maximum of 39-47 beds and 19-24 in ordinary and sub-intensive area, respectively. Patients had an average age of 66 years, and 62% of the total was female; prevalent comorbidities were arterial hypertension (53%), smoking habit (28.7%), obesity (27.9%), uncomplicated (10%), and complicated diabetes (9%). On the total, 339 patients were hospitalized in sub-intensive area, subjected to non-invasive ventilatory support. Hospitalization lasted about 7 days in the ordinary ward and 13 days in the sub-intensive area. One hundred six patients died. In the considered period, the mean percentage of deaths compared to hospitalizations in Italy was equal to 22.21%; in our experience, the overall mortality rate was 11%. Our organizational model, which included different intensity areas in the same ward and various specialist skills, as the ability to manage non-invasive ventilation and bedside ultrasound, allowed flexible management of the "complex" COVID patient. Even the mortality rate may be the result of this model. These features mark what modern Internal Medicine should be like.
