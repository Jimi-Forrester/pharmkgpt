24961930|t|Modulation of amyloid-beta aggregation by histidine-coordinating Cobalt(III) Schiff base complexes.
24961930|a|Oligomers of the Abeta42 peptide are significant neurotoxins linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Histidine (His) residues present at the N terminus of Abeta42 are believed to influence toxicity by either serving as metal-ion binding sites (which promote oligomerization and oxidative damage) or facilitating synaptic binding. Transition metal complexes that bind to these residues and modulate Abeta toxicity have emerged as therapeutic candidates. Cobalt(III) Schiff base complexes (Co-sb) were evaluated for their ability to interact with Abeta peptides. HPLC-MS, NMR, fluorescence, and DFT studies demonstrated that Co-sb complexes could interact with the His residues in a truncated Abeta16 peptide representing the Abeta42 N terminus. Coordination of Co-sb complexes altered the structure of Abeta42 peptides and promoted the formation of large soluble oligomers. Interestingly, this structural perturbation of Abeta correlated to reduced synaptic binding to hippocampal neurons. These results demonstrate the promise of Co-sb complexes in anti-AD therapeutic approaches.
