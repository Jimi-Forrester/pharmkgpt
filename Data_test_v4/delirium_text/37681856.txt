37681856|t|Mitochondria in the Spotlight: C. elegans as a Model Organism to Evaluate Xenobiotic-Induced Dysfunction.
37681856|a|Mitochondria play a crucial role in cellular respiration, ATP production, and the regulation of various cellular processes. Mitochondrial dysfunctions have been directly linked to pathophysiological conditions, making them a significant target of interest in toxicological research. In recent years, there has been a growing need to understand the intricate effects of xenobiotics on human health, necessitating the use of effective scientific research tools. Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans), a nonpathogenic nematode, has emerged as a powerful tool for investigating toxic mechanisms and mitochondrial dysfunction. With remarkable genetic homology to mammals, C. elegans has been used in studies to elucidate the impact of contaminants and drugs on mitochondrial function. This review focuses on the effects of several toxic metals and metalloids, drugs of abuse and pesticides on mitochondria, highlighting the utility of C. elegans as a model organism to investigate mitochondrial dysfunction induced by xenobiotics. Mitochondrial structure, function, and dynamics are discussed, emphasizing their essential role in cellular viability and the regulation of processes such as autophagy, apoptosis, and calcium homeostasis. Additionally, specific toxins and toxicants, such as arsenic, cadmium, and manganese are examined in the context of their impact on mitochondrial function and the utility of C. elegans in elucidating the underlying mechanisms. Furthermore, we demonstrate the utilization of C. elegans as an experimental model providing a promising platform for investigating the intricate relationships between xenobiotics and mitochondrial dysfunction. This knowledge could contribute to the development of strategies to mitigate the adverse effects of contaminants and drugs of abuse, ultimately enhancing our understanding of these complex processes and promoting human health.
