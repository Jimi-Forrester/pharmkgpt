36269366|a|Despite the high prevalence and the enormous medical and health economic impact, delirium syndromes are often underdiagnosed, which is mainly attributable to the high frequency of hypoactive delirium and to the frequently subtle and fluctuating psychopathology in the initial phase of delirium. These aspects also justify the need for a consequent and continuous application of standardized screening tools to detect delirium as early as possible. A multidimensional, nonpharmacological prevention of delirium is effective and still underutilized in the clinical practice. So far, there are no consensus recommendations regarding the pharmacological prevention of delirium. From a therapeutic perspective a causal approach is prioritized. Pharmacological treatment of delirium can only be considered under strict observance of specific indicators. When treating non-withdrawal-related delirium benzodiazepines should be avoided.
