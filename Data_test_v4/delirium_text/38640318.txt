38640318|a|BACKGROUND: Thoracic surgery without general anesthesia can be traced back to the First World War, and thoracic epidural block was used to complete the operation due to a large number of patients with gunshot wounds who needed emergency thoracic surgery. By reducing the intraoperative opioid dose, intraoperative and postoperative opioid-related adverse events such as respiratory depression, nausea and vomiting, delirium, hyperalgesia, and other side effects can be reduced to the benefit of patients. METHODS: A 72-year-old male patient was admitted to the hospital with a 5-day history of multifocal pain throughout the body caused by a fall. The injury was not treated at that time, and the pain gradually increased, accompanied by cough with difficulty expelling sputum. DIAGNOSES: Left lung contusion; traumatic pneumonia; multiple left rib fractures; left fluid pneumothorax; thyroid tumor of unknown nature, possibly malignant. Grade I tracheal stenosis; Sequelae of cerebral infarction. Because of goiter and severe tracheal compression, the patient was not intubated and received deopiated general anesthesia combined with epidural anesthesia to preserve spontaneous breathing. OUTCOMES: At the end of the video-assisted thoracoscopic exploration, the patient was immediately conscious and returned directly to the ward 6 min later. The patient was able to move freely after surgery and eat normally within 6 h of surgery. The postoperative visual analog scale score was 2 points, and there were no anesthetic complications during the follow-up. CONCLUSION: The opioid-free anesthesia strategy of tubeless general anesthesia, allowing spontaneous breathing combined with epidural anesthesia in elderly patients with tracheal stenosis undergoing video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery can not only avoid accidents and injuries caused by tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation, but can also significantly reduce postoperative respiratory complications, optimize postoperative analgesia, and help achieve enhanced recovery after surgery.
