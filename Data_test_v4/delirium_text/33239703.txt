33239703|t|Label-free X-ray estimation of brain amyloid burden.
33239703|a|Amyloid plaque deposits in the brain are indicative of Alzheimer's and other diseases. Measurements of brain amyloid burden in small animals require laborious post-mortem histological analysis or resource-intensive, contrast-enhanced imaging techniques. We describe a label-free method based on spectral small-angle X-ray scattering with a polychromatic beam for in vivo estimation of brain amyloid burden. Our findings comparing 5XFAD versus wild-type mice correlate well with histology, showing promise for a fast and practical in vivo technique.
