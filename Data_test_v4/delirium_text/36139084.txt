36139084|t|Iron in Alzheimer's Disease: From Physiology to Disease Disabilities.
36139084|a|Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a key role in the neurodegeneration processes. Increased oxidative stress damages lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids in brain tissue, and it is tied to the loss of biometal homeostasis. For this reason, attention has been focused on transition metals involved in several biochemical reactions producing ROS. Even though a bulk of evidence has uncovered the role of metals in the generation of the toxic pathways at the base of Alzheimer's disease (AD), this matter has been sidelined by the advent of the Amyloid Cascade Hypothesis. However, the link between metals and AD has been investigated in the last two decades, focusing on their local accumulation in brain areas known to be critical for AD. Recent evidence revealed a relation between iron and AD, particularly in relation to its capacity to increase the risk of the disease through ferroptosis. In this review, we briefly summarize the major points characterizing the function of iron in our body and highlight why, even though it is essential for our life, we have to monitor its dysfunction, particularly if we want to control our risk of AD.
