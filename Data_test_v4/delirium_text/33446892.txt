33446892|a|Pericytes apposed to the capillary endothelium are known to stabilize and promote endothelial integrity. Recent studies indicate that lung pericytes play a prominent role in lung physiology, and they are involved in the development of various lung diseases including lung injury in sepsis, pulmonary fibrosis, asthma, and pulmonary hypertension. Accordingly, human lung pericyte studies are important for understanding the mechanistic basis of lung physiology and pathophysiology; however, human lung pericytes can only be cultured for a few passages and no immortalized human lung pericyte cell line has been established so far. Thus, our study aims to establish an immortalized human lung pericyte cell line. Developed using SV40 large T antigen lentivirus, immortalized pericytes exhibit stable SV40T expression, sustained proliferation, and have significantly higher telomerase activity compared to normal human lung pericytes. In addition, these cells retained pericyte characteristics, marked by similar morphology, and expression of pericyte cell surface markers such as PDGFRbeta, NG2, CD44, CD146, CD90, and CD73. Furthermore, similar to that of primary pericytes, immortalized pericytes promoted endothelial cell tube formation and responded to different stimuli. Our previous data showed that friend leukemia virus integration 1 (Fli-1), a member of the ETS transcription factor family, is a key regulator that modulates inflammatory responses in mouse lung pericytes. We further demonstrated that Fli-1 regulates inflammatory responses in immortalized human lung pericytes. To summarize, we successfully established an immortalized human lung pericyte cell line, which serves as a promising tool for in vitro pericyte studies to understand human lung pericyte physiology and pathophysiology.
