39065339|t|Polyamidoamine Dendrimers: Brain-Targeted Drug Delivery Systems in Glioma Therapy.
39065339|a|Glioma is the most common primary intracranial tumor, which is formed by the malignant transformation of glial cells in the brain and spinal cord. It has the characteristics of high incidence, high recurrence rate, high mortality and low cure rate. The treatments for glioma include surgical removal, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Due to the obstruction of the biological barrier of brain tissue, it is difficult to achieve the desired therapeutic effects. To address the limitations imposed by the brain's natural barriers and enhance the treatment efficacy, researchers have effectively used brain-targeted drug delivery systems (DDSs) in glioma therapy. Polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimers, as branched macromolecular architectures, represent promising candidates for studies in glioma therapy. This review focuses on PAMAM-based DDSs in the treatment of glioma, highlighting their physicochemical characteristics, structural properties as well as an overview of the toxicity and safety profiles.
