36979505|t|Relationship between Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor and Cognitive Decline in Patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment and Dementia.
36979505|a|In the last decade, increasing evidence has emerged linking alterations in the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression with the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Because of the important role of BDNF in cognition and its association with AD pathogenesis, the aim of this study was to evaluate the potential difference in plasma BDNF concentrations between subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI; N = 209) and AD patients (N = 295) and to determine the possible association between BDNF plasma levels and the degree of cognitive decline in these individuals. The results showed a significantly higher (p < 0.001) concentration of plasma BDNF in subjects with AD (1.16; 0.13-21.34) compared with individuals with MCI (0.68; 0.02-19.14). The results of the present study additionally indicated a negative correlation between cognitive functions and BDNF plasma concentrations, suggesting higher BDNF levels in subjects with more pronounced cognitive decline. The correlation analysis revealed a significant negative correlation between BDNF plasma levels and both Mini-Mental State Examination (p < 0.001) and Clock Drawing test (p < 0.001) scores. In conclusion, the results of our study point towards elevated plasma BDNF levels in AD patients compared with MCI subjects, which may be due to the body's attempt to counteract the early and middle stages of neurodegeneration.
