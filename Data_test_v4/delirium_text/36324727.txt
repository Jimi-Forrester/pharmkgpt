36324727|a|Objective: To show a patient with a diagnosis of primary vasculitis of the nervous system and review this entity's literature. Clinical case: Male 32 years, with two events; first, with a transient monoparesis of the right upper extremity, improve with steroids in days. Now, with a motor Jacksonian progression from the upper to the lower right extremities and generalized seizures. After; aphasia, right hemiparesis, and delirium. In the antiresonance, the finding of multiple arterial cerebral "beading." With an in-depth study, the diagnosis of primary cerebral vasculitis was made. The management with levetiracetam, steroids, and Azathioprine offers a satisfactory evolution. Discussion: The primary CNS vasculitis is an exclusion diagnosis, with angio-MRI is possible to suspect it, but it is always obligate to discard a secondary etiology by infection, systemic diseases, neoplasia, and drugs. Conclusion: Although this problem is infrequent, we must consider this possibility. Opportune treatment can restore the quality of life.
