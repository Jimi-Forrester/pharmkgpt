30178864|a|OBJECTIVE: Delirium Tremens (DT) is the most severe complication of alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS), and has a mortality rate of 1-5%. Baclofen is recommended for spasticity treatment, but it has recently been used for alcohol withdrawal symptoms reduction and alcohol abstinence. CASE REPORT: A cervical spinal cord injury patient was treated for two years with oral baclofen 80 mg/day for spasticity. He is alcohol-dependent and a cannabis user and required an intrathecal baclofen (ITB) pump implant. A week after the implant, he stopped drinking, as "he didn't felt the urge anymore". The AWS appeared five days after the last alcohol intake and DT at 7 days. Diazepam 20 mg was used up to three times per day, but didn't seem to improve or reduce the anxiety, agitation, visual or auditory hallucinations. Two years later the patient remains alcohol abstinent and still on intrathecal baclofen. CONCLUSIONS: Alcohol-dependent patients can abruptly stop their alcohol intake, while in continuous infusion of intrathecal baclofen. Baclofen can be useful in the acute treatment of AWS as it seems to reduce diazepam requirements and in long-term alcohol abstinence. In the presence of AWS, while on chronic baclofen, no dose reduction should be attempted, as it can worsen the AWS or trigger baclofen withdrawal.
