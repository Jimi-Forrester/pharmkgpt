37461266|t|Single-cell landscape analysis reveals systematic senescence in mammalian Down syndrome.
37461266|a|BACKGROUND: Down syndrome (DS), which is characterized by various malfunctions, is the most common chromosomal disorder. As the DS population continues to grow and most of those with DS live beyond puberty, early-onset health problems have become apparent. However, the cellular landscape and molecular alterations have not been thoroughly studied. METHODS: This study utilized single-cell resolution techniques to examine DS in humans and mice, spanning seven distinct organs. A total of 71 934 mouse and 98 207 human cells were analyzed to uncover the molecular alterations occurring in different cell types and organs related to DS, specifically starting from the fetal stage. Additionally, SA-beta-Gal staining, western blot, and histological study were employed to verify the alterations. RESULTS: In this study, we firstly established the transcriptomic profile of the mammalian DS, deciphering the cellular map and molecular mechanism. Our analysis indicated that DS cells across various types and organs experienced senescence stresses from as early as the fetal stage. This was marked by elevated SA-beta-Gal activity, overexpression of cell cycle inhibitors, augmented inflammatory responses, and a loss of cellular identity. Furthermore, we found evidence of mitochondrial disturbance, an increase in ribosomal protein transcription, and heightened apoptosis in fetal DS cells. This investigation also unearthed a regulatory network driven by an HSA21 gene, which leads to genome-wide expression changes. CONCLUSION: The findings from this study offer significant insights into the molecular alterations that occur in DS, shedding light on the pathological processes underlying this disorder. These results can potentially guide future research and treatment development for DS.
