32821694|t|Intermittent Fasting: a Promising Approach for Preventing Vascular Dementia.
32821694|a|Vascular dementia is the most common neuropsychiatric syndrome and is characterized by synaptic dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and cognitive dysfunction. Vascular dementia is associated with various environmental, genetic, and lifestyle risk factors. Recent research has focused on the association between vascular dementia and dietary patterns, suggesting that dietary regulation leads to better control of energy metabolism, improvements in brain insulin resistance, and the suppression of neuroinflammation. Intermittent fasting is a calorie-restriction method known to be more effective in promoting fat loss and regulating the impairment of glucose metabolism as compared with other dietary restriction regimens. Herein, the authors review the effects of intermittent fasting with regard to vascular dementia based on recent evidence and propose that intermittent fasting could be a therapeutic approach for ameliorating vascular dementia pathology and preventing its onset.
