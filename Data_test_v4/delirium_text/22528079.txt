22528079|a|There is a great interest in the role of free radicals and oxidative stress in Alzheimer's disease and for the role of transition metals in the generation of oligomers of Abeta peptides. In the literature, there are a multitude of varying methods that can be used to create soluble oligomers of Abeta, however, the processes that create these oligomers are often stochastic by nature and thus reproducibility is an issue. Here we report a simple and reproducible method for the production of radically derived dityrosine cross-linked oligomers of Abeta, through reaction with copper and ascorbic acid.
