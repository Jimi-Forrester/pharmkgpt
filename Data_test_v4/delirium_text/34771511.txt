34771511|t|Do Lipid-based Nanoparticles Hold Promise for Advancing the Clinical Translation of Anticancer Alkaloids?
34771511|a|Since the commercialization of morphine in 1826, numerous alkaloids have been isolated and exploited effectively for the betterment of mankind, including cancer treatment. However, the commercialization of alkaloids as anticancer agents has generally been limited by serious side effects due to their lack of specificity to cancer cells, indiscriminate tissue distribution and toxic formulation excipients. Lipid-based nanoparticles represent the most effective drug delivery system concerning clinical translation owing to their unique, appealing characteristics for drug delivery. To the extent of our knowledge, this is the first review to compile in vitro and in vivo evidence of encapsulating anticancer alkaloids in lipid-based nanoparticles. Alkaloids encapsulated in lipid-based nanoparticles have generally displayed enhanced in vitro cytotoxicity and an improved in vivo efficacy and toxicity profile than free alkaloids in various cancers. Encapsulated alkaloids also demonstrated the ability to overcome multidrug resistance in vitro and in vivo. These findings support the broad application of lipid-based nanoparticles to encapsulate anticancer alkaloids and facilitate their clinical translation. The review then discusses several limitations of the studies analyzed, particularly the discrepancies in reporting the pharmacokinetics, biodistribution and toxicity data. Finally, we conclude with examples of clinically successful encapsulated alkaloids that have received regulatory approval and are undergoing clinical evaluation.
