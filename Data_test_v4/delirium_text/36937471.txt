36937471|t|Plasma tau and neurofilament light chain as biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease and their relation to cognitive functions.
36937471|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia is the most frequent cause of neurodegenerative dementia. The cognitive and behavioral symptoms associated with this disorder often have overlapping characteristics, potentially resulting in delayed diagnosis or misdiagnosis. This study aimed to assess the level of peripheral blood neurofilament light chain (NfL) and total tau (t-tau) protein in AD patients and investigate their relationship with cognitive impairment. The study included 80 participants of both sexes between the ages of 60 to 85 years. The participants were divided into two groups, consisting of 40 individuals in the control group (mean age 75+-6.6 years) who had no cognitive or functional impairments and 40 AD patients (mean age 74.98+-5.03 years). This study utilized the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for major or mild neurocognitive disorder attributed to Alzheimer's disease (AD). The clinical and biochemical features of all participants were documented, and the Alzheimer's disease Assessment Scale cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog) scores were evaluated. Sandwich ELISA was employed to determine serum NfL and t-tau protein levels. The median serum NfL and t-tau protein levels in AD patients were significantly higher than those of the controls (47.84 pg/ml versus 17.66 pg/ml and 12.05 pg/ml versus 11.13 pg/ml, respectively). Age was positively correlated with NfL, t-tau levels, and ADAS-cog. Although elevated NfL and t-tau protein levels may play a role in disease progression, their diagnostic value for AD was limited.
