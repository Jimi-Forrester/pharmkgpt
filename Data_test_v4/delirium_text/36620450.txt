36620450|t|Research trends and hotspots on connectomes from 2005 to 2021: A bibliometric and latent Dirichlet allocation application study.
36620450|a|Background: This study aimed to conduct a bibliometric analysis of publications on connectomes and illustrate its trends and hotspots using a machine-learning-based text mining algorithm. Methods: Documents were retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) and Scopus databases and analyzed in Rstudio 1.3.1. Through quantitative and qualitative methods, the most productive and impactful academic journals in the field of connectomes were compared in terms of the total number of publications and h-index over time. Meanwhile, the countries/regions and institutions involved in connectome research were compared, as well as their scientific collaboration. The study analyzed topics and research trends by R package "bibliometrix." The major topics of connectomes were classified by Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). Results: A total of 14,140 publications were included in the study. NEUROIMAGE ranked first in terms of publication volume (1,427 articles) and impact factor (h-index:122) among all the relevant journals. The majority of articles were published by developed countries, with the United States having the most. Harvard Medical School and the University of Pennsylvania were the two most productive institutions. Neuroimaging analysis technology and brain functions and diseases were the two major topics of connectome research. The application of machine learning, deep learning, and graph theory analysis in connectome research has become the current trend, while an increasing number of studies were concentrating on dynamic functional connectivity. Meanwhile, researchers have begun investigating alcohol use disorders and migraine in terms of brain connectivity in the past 2 years. Conclusion: This study illustrates a comprehensive overview of connectome research and provides researchers with critical information for understanding the recent trends and hotspots of connectomes.
