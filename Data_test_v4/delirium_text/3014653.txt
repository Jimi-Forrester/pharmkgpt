3014653|t|Human prion protein cDNA: molecular cloning, chromosomal mapping, and biological implications.
3014653|a|A human complementary DNA whose protein product is considered to be the major component of scrapie-associated fibrils in Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, kuru, and Gerstmann-Straussler syndrome has been identified and characterized. The extensive homology of this gene sequence to the hamster PrP 27- to 30-kilodalton prion protein complementary DNA clone, and its existence as a single copy in the human genome, leads to the conclusion that this is the human prion gene. This human prion gene has been mapped to human chromosome 20, negating a direct link between the prion protein and Down's syndrome or the amyloid of Alzheimer's disease.
