31213143|t|Age-Related Hearing Loss Associations With Changes in Brain Morphology.
31213143|a|Age-related hearing loss has been associated with varied auditory cortex morphology in human neuroimaging studies. These findings have suggested that peripheral auditory system declines cause changes in brain morphology but could also be due to latent variables that affect the auditory periphery and brain. The current longitudinal study was designed to evaluate these explanations for pure-tone threshold and brain morphology associations. Thirty adults (mean age at Time 1 = 64.12 +- 10.32 years) were studied at two time points (average duration between visits = 2.62 +- 0.81 years). Small- to medium-effect size associations were observed between high-frequency pure-tone thresholds and auditory cortex gray matter volume at each time point. Although there were significant longitudinal changes in low- and high-frequency hearing measures and brain morphology, those longitudinal changes were not significantly correlated across participants. High-frequency hearing measures at Time 1 were significantly related to more lateral ventricle expansion, such that participants with higher measures exhibited larger increases in ventricle size. This ventricle effect was statistically independent of high-frequency hearing associations with auditory cortex morphology. Together, these results indicate that there are at least two mechanisms for associations between age-related hearing loss and brain morphology. Potential explanations for a direct hearing loss effect on brain morphology, as well as latent variables that likely affect both the inner ear and brain, are discussed.
