35434801|t|Amyloid beta induces Fmr1-dependent translational suppression and hyposynchrony of neural activity via phosphorylation of eIF2alpha and eEF2.
35434801|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, with the accumulation of amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) being one of the main causes of the disease. Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), encoded by fragile X mental retardation 1 (Fmr1), is an RNA-binding protein that represses translation of its bound mRNAs or exerts other indirect mechanisms that result in translational suppression. Because the accumulation of Abeta has been shown to cause translational suppression resulting from the elevated cellular stress response, in this study we asked whether and how Fmr1 is involved in Abeta-induced translational regulation. Our data first showed that the application of synthetic Abeta peptide induces the expression of Fmr1 in cultured primary neurons. We followed by showing that Fmr1 is required for Abeta-induced translational suppression, hyposynchrony of neuronal firing activity, and loss of excitatory synapses. Mechanistically, we revealed that Fmr1 functions to repress the expression of phosphatases including protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), leading to elevated phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2-alpha (eIF2alpha) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2), and subsequent translational suppression. Finally, our data suggest that such translational suppression is critical to Abeta-induced hyposynchrony of firing activity, but not the loss of synapses. Altogether, our study uncovers a novel mechanism by which Abeta triggers translational suppression and we reveal the participation of Fmr1 in altered neural plasticity associated with Abeta pathology. Our study may also provide information for a better understanding of Abeta-induced cellular stress responses in AD.
