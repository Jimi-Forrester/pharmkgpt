38645131|a|Objectives: Apraxia is a core feature of Alzheimer's disease, but the pathomechanism of this characteristic symptom is not well understood. Here, we systematically investigated apraxia profiles in a well-defined group of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD; N=32) who additionally underwent PET imaging with the second-generation tau PET tracer [18F]PI-2620. We hypothesized that specific patterns of tau pathology might be related to apraxic deficits. Methods: Patients (N=32) with a biomarker-confirmed diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease were recruited in addition to a sample cognitively unimpaired controls (CU 1 ; N=41). Both groups underwent in-depth neuropsychological assessment of apraxia (Dementia Apraxia Screening Test; DATE and the Cologne Apraxia Screening; KAS). In addition, static PET imaging with [18F]PI-2620 was performed to assess tau pathology in the AD patients. To specifically investigate the association of apraxia with regional tau-pathology, we compared the PET-data from this group with an independent sample of amyloid-negative cognitively intact participants (CU 2; N=54) by generation of z-score-deviation maps as well as voxel- based multiple regression analyses. Results: We identified significant clusters of tau-aggregation in praxis-related regions (e.g., supramarginal gyrus, angular gyrus, temporal, parietal and occipital regions) that were associated with apraxia. These regions were similar between the two apraxia assessments. No correlations between tau-tracer uptake in primary motor cortical or subcortical brain regions and apraxia were observed. Conclusions: These results suggest that tau deposition in specific cortical brain regions may induce local neuronal dysfunction leading to a dose-dependent functional decline in praxis performance.
