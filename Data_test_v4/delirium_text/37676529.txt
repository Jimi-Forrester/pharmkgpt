37676529|a|Heat stress (HS) can cause a series of stress responses, resulting in numerous negative effects on the body, such as the diminished food intake, carcass quality and reproductive capacity. In addition to the negative effects on the peripheral system, HS leads to central nervous system (CNS) disorders given its toll on neuroinflammation. This neuroinflammatory process is mainly mediated by microglia and astrocytes, which are involved in the activation of glial cells and the secretion of cytokines. While the regulation of inflammatory signaling has a close relationship with the expression of heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70), HS-induced neuroinflammation is closely related to the activation of the TLR4/NF-kappaB pathway. Moreover, oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress are key players in the development of neuroinflammation. Chromium (Cr) has been widely shown to have neuroprotective effects in both humans and animals, despite the lack of mechanistic evidence. Evidence has shown that Cr supplementation can increase the levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), a major neurotrophic factor with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. This review highlights recent advances in the attenuating effects and potential mechanisms of Cr-mediated IGF-1 actions on HS-induced neuroinflammation, providing presently existing evidence supporting the neuroprotective role of Cr.
