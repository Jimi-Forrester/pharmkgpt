33916409|a|An increasing number of clinical studies worldwide are investigating the repurposing of antiviral, immune-modulatory, and anti-inflammatory agents to face the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic. Nevertheless, few effective therapies exist to prevent or treat COVID-19, which demands increased drug discovery and repurposing efforts. In fact, many currently tested drugs show unknown efficacy and unpredictable drug interactions, such that interventions are needed to guarantee access to effective and safe medicines. Anti-inflammatory therapy has proven to be effective in preventing further injury in COVID-19 patients, but the benefit comes at a cost, as targeting inflammatory pathways can imply an increased risk of infection. Thus, optimization of the risk/benefit ratio is required in the anti-inflammatory strategy against COVID-19, which accounts for drug formulations and delivery towards regionalization and personalization of treatment approaches. In this perspective, we discuss how better knowledge of endogenous immunomodulatory pathways may optimize the clinical use of novel and repurposed drugs against COVID-19 in inpatient, outpatient, and home settings through innovative drug discovery, appropriate drug delivery systems and dedicated molecular pharmaceutics.
