21629705|t|Mitochondria and PGC-1alpha in Aging and Age-Associated Diseases.
21629705|a|Aging is the most significant risk factor for a range of degenerative disease such as cardiovascular, neurodegenerative and metabolic disorders. While the cause of aging and its associated diseases is multifactorial, mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in the aging process and the onset and progression of age-associated disorders. Recent studies indicate that maintenance of mitochondrial function is beneficial in the prevention or delay of age-associated diseases. A central molecule seems to be the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator alpha (PGC-1alpha), which is the key regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis. Besides regulating mitochondrial function, PGC-1alpha targets several other cellular processes and thereby influences cell fate on multiple levels. This paper discusses how mitochondrial function and PGC-1alpha are affected in age-associated diseases and how modulation of PGC-1alpha might offer a therapeutic potential for age-related pathology.
