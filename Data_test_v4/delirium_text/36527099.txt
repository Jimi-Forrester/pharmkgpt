36527099|a|BACKGROUND: Considerable evidence indicates that a signaling crosstalk between the brain and periphery plays important roles in neurological disorders, and that both acute and chronic peripheral inflammation can produce brain changes leading to cognitive impairments. Recent clinical and epidemiological studies have revealed an increased risk of cognitive impairment and dementia in individuals with impaired pulmonary function. However, the mechanistic underpinnings of this association remain unknown. Exposure to SiO2 (silica) particles triggers lung inflammation, including infiltration by peripheral immune cells and upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines. We here utilized a mouse model of lung silicosis to investigate the crosstalk between lung inflammation and memory. METHODS: Silicosis was induced by intratracheal administration of a single dose of 2.5 mg SiO2/kg in mice. Molecular and behavioral measurements were conducted 24 h and 15 days after silica administration. Lung and hippocampal inflammation were investigated by histological analysis and by determination of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Hippocampal synapse damage, amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide content and phosphorylation of Akt, a proxy of hippocampal insulin signaling, were investigated by Western blotting and ELISA. Memory was assessed using the open field and novel object recognition tests. RESULTS: Administration of silica induced alveolar collapse, lung infiltration by polymorphonuclear (PMN) cells, and increased lung pro-inflammatory cytokines. Lung inflammation was followed by upregulation of hippocampal pro-inflammatory cytokines, synapse damage, accumulation of the Abeta peptide, and memory impairment in mice. CONCLUSION: The current study identified a crosstalk between lung and brain inflammatory responses leading to hippocampal synapse damage and memory impairment after exposure to a single low dose of silica in mice.
