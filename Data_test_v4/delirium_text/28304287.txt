28304287|a|BACKGROUND: The relationship of obesity with risk for dementia is complex and may change with age. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the relationship between measures of obesity at age 40-65 and dementia prevalence in survivors 36 years later. METHODS: Obesity-related measures of triceps and subscapular skinfold thickness were assessed in 1963 in n = 9,760 men aged 40-65 participating in the Israel Ischemic Heart Disease study. Cognitive evaluation and assessment of dementia prevalence were performed in n = 1,643 participants of the original cohort who survived until 1999/2000 (age >=76 years) and had anthropometric measures in 1963. RESULTS: Age-adjusted prevalence of dementia in survivors in 1999/2000 by baseline triceps skinfold quintile was 20.5%, 21.2%, 17.6%, 15.6%, and 14.5%, respectively, from lowest to highest (p = 0.006 in trend test). Using logistic regression, a 6-mm increment of triceps skinfold was associated with an age and BMI-adjusted odds ratio of 0.81 (95% CI, 0.70-0.94) for dementia prevalence among survivors. Age-adjusted risk for dementia by subscapular skinfold quintile demonstrated 20.5%, 17.1%, 15.7%, 19.4%, and 18.1%, respectively, in groups of subjects by subscapular skinfold quintile from lowest to highest (p = 0.6 in trend test). CONCLUSIONS: Lower triceps skinfold at age 40-65, reflecting diminished peripheral fat, was associated with higher dementia prevalence in late life, potentially suggesting a protective role of peripheral fat to brain health.
