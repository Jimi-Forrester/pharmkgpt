28098506|a|The deposition of amyloid protein as senile plaques is the major signature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). It is produced by the sequential cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein by secretases. Moreover, peppers are noted for their antiaging and cognitive enhancing properties. Thus, in this study, the effects of polyphenol-rich extracts from bell pepper on amyloid production and aggregation in vitro were investigated. Bell pepper (ripe and unripe) was extracted with methanol-1 N HCl (1:1 v/v). Thereafter, the inhibitory potentials of the extracts on beta-secretase and beta-amyloid1-40 aggregation were determined. Phenolic composition of the pepper fruits was further determined by HPLC-DAD (high performance liquid chromatography-diode array detector). There was a dose-dependent inhibition of beta-secretase by the pepper fruits with the ripe fruits (2.17 +- 0.17 mug/L) showing a significantly (P < .05) higher inhibitory effect than the unripe (3.44 +- 0.11 mug/L). Furthermore, Thioflavin-T and transmission electron microscopy analyses revealed that phenolic extracts from pepper fruits (1 and 10 mug/L) could counteract the initial aggregation of Abeta1-40, as well as prevent further aggregation preformed fibrils. These inhibitory activities could be attributed to the predominant presence of phenolic constituents in the pepper fruits. It is possible to conclude that bell pepper could be a possible dietary intervention into the management of AD.
