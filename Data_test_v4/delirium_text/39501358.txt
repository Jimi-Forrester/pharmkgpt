39501358|a|Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy demonstrates substantial efficacy in various hematological malignancies. However, its application in solid tumors is still limited. Clinical studies report suboptimal outcomes such as reduced cytotoxicity of CAR-T cells and tumor evasion, underscoring the need to address the challenges of sliding cytotoxicity in CAR-T cells. Despite improvements from fourth and next-generation CAR-T cells, new challenges include systemic toxicity from continuously secreted proteins, low productivity, and elevated costs. Recent research targets genetic modifications to boost killing potential, metabolic interventions to hinder tumor progression, and diverse combination strategies to enhance CAR-T cell therapy. Efforts to reduce the duration and cost of CAR-T cell therapy include developing allogenic and in-vivo approaches, promising significant future advancements. Concurrently, innovative technologies and platforms enhance the potential of CAR-T cell therapy to overcome limitations in treating solid tumors. This review explores strategies to optimize CAR-T cell therapies for solid tumors, focusing on enhancing cytotoxicity and overcoming application restrictions. We summarize recent advances in T cell subset selection, CAR-T structural modifications, infiltration enhancement, genetic and metabolic interventions, production optimization, and the integration of novel technologies, presenting therapeutic approaches that could improve CAR-T cell therapy's efficacy and applicability in solid tumors.
