28790417|a|The role of microglia in the pathophysiology of ischemic retinal diseases has been extensively studied. Retinal microglial activation may be correlated with retinal neovascularization in oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR), an animal model that has been widely used in retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) research. Minocycline is an antibiotic that decreases microglial activation following hyperoxic and hypoxic-ischemic phases in neonatal rodents. Here, we investigated the effects of minocycline on vascularization and visual function. In our results, we found that after the administration of minocycline, microglial reactivity was reduced in the retina, which was accompanied by an increase in the avascular area at P12, P14 and P17. Although microglial reactivity was reduced at P17, minocycline treatment did not attenuate retinal neovascularization. A changing trend in microglial number was observed, and the apoptosis and proliferation states on different days partly contributed to this change. Further study also revealed that although minocycline downregulated the levels of proinflammatory factors, visual function appeared to be significantly worsened. Collectively, we demonstrated that minocycline disturbed the physiological vascularization of the avascular area and exacerbated visual dysfunction, indicating that minocycline may not be an effective drug and may even be detrimental for the treatment of ischemic retinopathy in immature mammals.
