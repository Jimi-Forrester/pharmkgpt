38216388|t|Long term opioid use after burn injury: a retrospective cohort study.
38216388|a|BACKGROUND: Patients who have survive a burn injury might be at risk of opioid dependence after discharge. This study examined the use of opioids in patients who suffer burn injury and explored factors associated with persistent opioid use after hospital discharge. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study compared adults admitted with a burn injury from 2009 to 2019 with two matched comparison cohorts from the general population and adults with a diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. Pre-admission prescription opioid use was determined, and a multivariable negative binomial regression analysis used to explore post-discharge opioid use. RESULTS: A total of 7147 burn patients were matched with 6810 pancreatitis patients and with 28 184 individuals from the general population. Pre-admission opioid use was higher in the burn and pancreatitis cohorts (29% and 40%, respectively) compared with the general population (17%). Opioid use increased in both burn and pancreatitis cohorts after discharge (41% and 53%, respectively), although patients with pancreatitis were at even higher risk of increased opioid use in an adjusted analysis (incidence rate ratio 1.43). Female sex, lower socioeconomic status, ICU admission, pre-injury opioid use, and a history of excess alcohol use were all associated with an increase in opioid prescriptions after discharge. CONCLUSIONS: Opioid use is high in those admitted with a burn injury or acute pancreatitis when compared with the general population, increasing further after hospital discharge. Female sex and socioeconomic deprivation are among factors that make increased opioid use more likely, although this phenomenon seems even more pronounced in those with acute pancreatitis compared with burn injuries.
