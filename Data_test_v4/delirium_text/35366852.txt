35366852|a|BACKGROUND: In regard to central nervous system tumour resection, preserving vital venous structures to avoid devastating consequences such as brain oedema and haemorrhage is important. However, in clinical practice, it is difficult to obtain clear and vivid intraoperative venous visualization and blood flow analyses. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed patients who underwent brain tumour resection with the application of indocyanine green videoangiography (ICG-VA) integrated with FLOW 800 from February 2019 to December 2020 and present our clinical cases to demonstrate the process of venous preservation. Galen, sylvian and superior cerebral veins were included in these cases. RESULTS: Clear documentation of the veins from different venous groups was obtained via ICG-VA integrated with FLOW 800, which semiquantitatively analysed the flow dynamics. ICG-VA integrated with FLOW 800 enabled us to achieve brain tumour resection without venous injury or obstruction of venous flux. CONCLUSIONS: ICG-VA integrated with FLOW 800 is an available method for venous preservation, although further comparisons between ICG-VA integrated with FLOW 800 and other techniques of intraoperative blood flow monitoring is needed.
