18284028|a|PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: Body composition and obesity-related lifestyle factors are associated with increased risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Amyloid beta (Abeta) is a peptide integral in the pathogenesis of AD. Abeta has been shown to be related to body fat and exercise in younger adults; however, no study to date has examined the possible relationship among Abeta, body composition and fitness indices in older adults. METHODS AND PROCEDURES: Thirty-five older adults without significant neurological or psychiatric history, underwent fasting blood draw and completed cognitive testing and body composition and physical fitness assessments. RESULTS: Partial correlations showed Abeta levels were inversely related to cognitive function, body fat and physical fitness measures. CONCLUSIONS: Findings indicate Abeta is associated with cognitive function, body fat and physical fitness in neurologically healthy older adults. Further work is needed to clarify possible mechanisms, particularly longitudinal studies.
