38596059|a|The amyloid plaque is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. The accumulation of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) in the neuronal structure is assumed to lead to amyloid plaque formation through the excessive production of beta-amyloid protein. To study the relationship between the neuronal accumulation of APP and amyloid plaque formation, we histologically analyzed their development in the different brain regions in 3xTg-AD mice, which express Swedish mutated APP (APPSWE) in the neurons. Observation throughout the brain revealed APPSWE-positive somata in the broad regions. Quantitative model analysis showed that the somatic accumulation of APPSWE developed firstly in the hippocampus from a very early age (<1 month) and proceeded slower in the isocortex. In line with this, the hippocampus was the first region to form amyloid plaques at the age of 9-12 months, while amyloid plaques were rarely observed in the isocortex. Females had more APPSWE-positive somata and plaques than males. Furthermore, amyloid plaques were observed in the lateral septum and pontine grey, which did not contain APPSWE-positive somata but only the APPSWE-positive fibers. These results suggested that neuronal accumulation of APPSWE, both in somatodendritic and axonal domains, is closely related to the formation of amyloid plaques.
