29246979|a|The thalamic nuclei are thought to play a critical role in recognition memory. Specifically, the anterior thalamic nuclei and medial dorsal nuclei may serve as critical output structures in distinct hippocampal and perirhinal cortex systems, respectively. Existing evidence indicates that damage to the anterior thalamic nuclei leads to impairments in hippocampal-dependent tasks. However, evidence for the opposite pattern following medial dorsal nuclei damage has not yet been identified. In the present study, we investigated recognition memory in NC, a patient with relatively selective medial dorsal nuclei damage, using two object recognition tests with similar foils: a yes/no (YN) test that requires the hippocampus, and a forced choice corresponding test (FCC) that is supported by perirhinal cortex. NC performed normally in the YN test, but was impaired in the FCC test. Critically, FCC performance was impaired only when the study-test delay period was filled with interference. We interpret these results in the context of the representational-hierarchical model, which predicts that memory deficits following damage to the perirhinal system arise due to increased vulnerability to interference. These data provide the first evidence for selective deficits in a task that relies on perirhinal output following damage to the medial dorsal nuclei, providing critical evidence for dissociable thalamic contributions to recognition memory.
