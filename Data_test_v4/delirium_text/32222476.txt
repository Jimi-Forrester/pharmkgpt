32222476|a|Blood-based biomarker assays of plasma beta-amyloid (Abeta) and tau have the advantages of cost-effective and less invasive for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We used two independent cohorts to cross-validate the clinical use of the nanoparticle-based immunomagnetic assay of plasma biomarkers to assist in the differential diagnosis of early AD. There were in total 160 subjects in the derivation cohort, and 242 in the validation cohort both containing controls, mild cognitive impairment due to AD and AD dementia diagnosed according to the 2011 NIA-AA guidelines. The cutoff value for plasma Abeta1-42 (16.4 pg/ml) performed the best in differentiating between controls and patients with prodromal or clinical AD, with 92.5% for positive percent agreement (PPA), negative percent agreement (NPA), and overall rate of agreement (ORA). Abeta1-42 x tau (642.58) was useful for separating patients with dementia and prodromal states of AD, with 84.9% PPA, 78.8% NPA and 83% ORA.
