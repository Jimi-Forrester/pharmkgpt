39627617|a|Neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Parkinson's disease (PD) affect millions of people worldwide. Curative treatment for these neurodegenerative disorders is still lacking and therefore a further understanding of their cause and progression is urgently needed. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are nanosized vesicles loaded with cargo, such as proteins and miRNAs, that are released by cells and play an important role in intercellular communication. Intercellular communication through EVs can contribute to the spread of pathological proteins, such as amyloid-beta and tau, or cause pathogenesis through other mechanisms. In addition, EVs may serve as potential biomarkers for diagnosis and for monitoring disease progression. In this review, we summarize and discuss recent advances in our understanding of the role of EVs in AD, ALS an PD with an emphasis on dysregulated cargo in each disease. We highlight shared dysregulated cargo between these diseases, discuss underlying pathways, and outline future implications for therapeutic strategies.
