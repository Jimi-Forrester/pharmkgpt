37370950|a|Since the outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19) in 2019, various rare movement disorders and cognitive changes have been recognized as potential neurological complications. The early treatment of some of these allows rapid recovery; therefore, we must diagnose these manifestations in a timely way. We describe the case of a 76-year-old man infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 who presented with confusion and hallucinations and was admitted to our hospital 14 days after the onset of symptoms. One day later, he developed generalized myoclonus, dysarthria and ataxia, and tonic clonic seizures and was admitted to the intensive care unit. A diagnosis of COVID-19-associated autoimmune encephalitis with characteristics of limbic encephalitis and immune-mediated acute cerebellar ataxia and myoclonus syndrome was supported by alterations in the limbic system shown in magnetic resonance imaging, lateralized discharges shown in electroencephalography, a slightly elevated protein level in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and indirect immunofluorescence in the CSF with autoantibody binding to anatomical structures of the cerebellum and hippocampus. The patient improved with 2 weeks of corticosteroid treatment and four sessions of plasmapheresis. Our current case study describes a rare case of COVID-19-related limbic encephalitis with immune-mediated acute cerebellar ataxia and myoclonus syndrome (ACAM syndrome) and strengthens the need for tissue-based assays (TBAs) to screen the serum and/or CSF of patients highly suspected to have autoimmune encephalitis. We believe that the timely diagnosis and targeted aggressive immunotherapy were mainly responsible for the patient's total recovery.
