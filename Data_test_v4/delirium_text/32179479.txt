32179479|a|The SUSD4 (Sushi domain-containing protein 4) gene encodes a complement inhibitor that is frequently deleted in 1q41q42 microdeletion syndrome, a multisystem congenital disorder that includes neurodevelopmental abnormalities. To understand SUSD4's role in the mammalian nervous system, we analyzed Susd4 knockout (KO) mice. Susd4 KO mice exhibited significant defects in motor performance and significantly higher levels of anxiety-like behaviors. Susd4 KO brain had abnormal "hairy" basket cells surrounding Purkinje neurons within the cerebellum and significantly reduced dendritic spine density in hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Neurons and oligodendrocyte lineage cells of wild-type mice were found to express Susd4 mRNA. Protein expression of the complement component C1q was increased in the brains of Susd4 KO mice. Our data indicate that SUSD4 plays an important role in neuronal functions, possibly via the complement pathway, and that SUSD4 deletion may contribute to the nervous system abnormalities in patients with 1q41q42 deletions.
