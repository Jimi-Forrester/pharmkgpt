37773120|t|Mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles for treatment of bone loss within periodontitis in pre-clinical animal models: a meta-analysis.
37773120|a|BACKGROUND: Mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) represent an effective and promising strategy for periodontitis, although studies remain pre-clinical. Herein, a meta-analysis was conducted to assess the efficacy of MSC-EVs in animal models of periodontitis. METHODS: The PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase electronic databases were searched up to Dec 2022 to retrieve preclinical studies examining the use of MSC-EVs for periodontitis treatment. Meta-analyses and sub-group analyses were performed to assess the effect of MSC-EVs on Bone Volume/Total Volume (BV/TV) or the distance between the cementoenamel junction and alveolar bone crest (CEJ-ABC) in pre-clinical animal models of periodontitis. RESULTS: 11 studies published from Mar 2019 to Oct 2022 met the inclusion criteria. Overall, MSC-EVs contributed to periodontal bone regeneration in the inflammatory bone loss area due to periodontitis, as represented by a weighted mean difference (WMD) of 14.07% (95% CI = 6.73, 21.41%, p < 0.001) for BV/TV and a WMD of -0.12 mm (95% CI= -0.14, -0.11 mm, p < 0.001) for CEJ-ABC. However, sub-analysis suggested that there was no significant difference in CEJ-ABC between studies with bioactive scaffolds and studies without bioactive scaffolds (p = 0.60). CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggests that MSC-EVs may represent an attractive therapy for the treatment of inflammatory bone loss within periodontitis.
