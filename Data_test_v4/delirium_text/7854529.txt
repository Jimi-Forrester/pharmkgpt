7854529|a|We examined gender differences in probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients on language measures at four data collections (entry, 6, 12, and 18 months) and a normal elderly (NE) comparison group at entry and 18 months. Comparison of gender differences in language abilities of 60 (29 men, 31 women) early (Clinical Dementia Ratings I and II) AD subjects at entry revealed significant effects for gender on the Boston Naming Test (BNT) and Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-Revised (PPVT-R) but not on the Word Fluency Test, shortened Token Test, or modified Reporter's Test. The 37 subjects (18 men, 19 women) who completed less than four data collection sessions compared with the 23 subjects (11 men, 12 women) who completed all four sessions differed on education and Reporter's Test scores. Longitudinal analysis of measures showed that gender differences persisted for the BNT and PPVT-R and that time differences were found on all measures. Gender differences remained after correcting for age, education, duration of illness, and mental status. We found no differences for the NE comparison group for gender or time. All AD subject trends were downward, suggesting that (1) language is affected over time in AD, (2) both men and women decline at similar rates, and (3) language abilities of women are more severely impaired at all time points.
