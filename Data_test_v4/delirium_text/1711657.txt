1711657|a|The trisomy 16 mouse is considered to be a model of human trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) due to genetic homology between parts of human chromosome 21 and mouse chromosome 16. Additionally, and because older Down syndrome individuals develop neuropathology indistinguishable from that of Alzheimer's disease, trisomy 16 tissue may provide a model of some pathological processes occurring in Alzheimer's disease. However, trisomy 16 fetuses die in utero or shortly after birth, preventing exploitation of this model. We therefore sought to examine trisomy 16 brain tissue over an extended period of time. We report that neural transplantation to normal hosts allows the maintenance of cortical and hippocampal neurons for at least 8 months, thus providing a model in which to examine pathological processes related to Down syndrome, and perhaps to Alzheimer's disease.
