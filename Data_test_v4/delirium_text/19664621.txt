19664621|a|Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors, have been unsuccessful in slowing or reversing Alzheimer's disease (AD). Thus, understanding the expression patterns of the downstream effectors for the regulation of prostaglandin synthesis may be important for understanding the pathological processes involved in AD and formulating more effective pharmacotherapeutics for this disease. In this study, we used immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry, and Western blot analysis to compare patterns of microsomal prostaglandin E synthase (mPGES)-2 expression in the middle frontal gyrus (MFG) of AD patients and age-matched controls. In control human brain sections, mPGES-2 immunoreactivity was observed in neurons, activated microglia, and endothelium, but not in resting microglia, astrocytes, or smooth muscle cells. Microsomal PGES-2 immunoreactivity was particularly elevated in the pyramidal neurons of brains from three of five sporadic and four of five familial AD patients compared with four of five age-matched control brains that showed minimal immunoreactivity. In contrast, Western blot analysis revealed no difference in mPGES-2 levels between end-stage AD brain tissue and control brain tissue. These results suggest that in human cortex, mPGES-2 is constitutive in neurons and endothelium and induced in activated microglia. Furthermore, the high immunoreactivity of mPGES-2 in pyramidal neurons of AD brains indicates that it might have a potential role in the functional replacement of cytosolic PGES or inactive mPGES-1 in later stages of AD.
