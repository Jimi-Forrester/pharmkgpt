38301091|t|Celecoxib in Treatment of Postpartum Depression: A Case Report.
38301091|a|Postpartum depression (PPD) impairs mother-infant interaction and has negative effects on the child's emotional, behavioral, and cognitive skills. There is considerable evidence to suggest that inflammation plays a role in the pathogenesis of depression. Controlled trials indicate that celecoxib has antidepressant effects in patients with major depressive disorder. A 34-year-old woman with mild to moderate PPD received a celecoxib capsule twice a day. This treatment has not been reported in previous studies and is novel in clinical practice. The patient was assessed using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS). Moreover, levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and inflammatory cytokines were measured at baseline and at the end of celecoxib therapy. This case suggests that celecoxib can improve depressive symptoms in patients with mild to moderate PPD. No adverse effects occurred during follow-up.
