23294326|a|The deposition of amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) is a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We previously found that the ganglioside-enriched microdomains (ganglioside clusters) in presynaptic neuronal membranes play a key role in the initiation of the Abeta assembly process. However, not all ganglioside clusters accelerate Abeta assembly. In the present study, we directly observed a spherical Abeta in an atomic force microscopic study on the morphology of a reconstituted lipid bilayer composed of lipids that were extracted from a detergent-resistant membrane microdomain (DRM) fraction of synaptosomes prepared from aged mouse brain. The Abeta assembly was generated on a distinctive GM1 domain, which was characterized as the Abeta-sensitive ganglioside nanocluster (ASIGN). By using an artificial GM1 cluster-binding peptide, ASIGN was found to have a high density of GM1; therefore, there would be a critical density of GM1 in nanoclusters to induce Abeta binding and assembly. These results suggest that ganglioside-bound Abeta (GAbeta), which acts as an endogenous seed for Abeta fibril formation in AD brains, is generated on ASIGN on synaptosomal membranes.
