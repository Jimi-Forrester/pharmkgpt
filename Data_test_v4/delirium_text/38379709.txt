38379709|t|Association of peripheral B cells and delirium: combined single-cell sequencing and Mendelian randomization analysis.
38379709|a|Background: Delirium seriously affects the prognosis of patients and greatly reduces the ability to work and live. Peripheral inflammatory events may contribute to the development of delirium, the mechanism of which is still unclear. There is a lack of effective diagnostic and treatments for delirium in clinical practice. The study aims to investigate alterations in peripheral immune cell subsets under inflammatory stress and to explore causal associations with delirium. Methods: Single-cell transcriptional sequencing data of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) before and after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) intervention were processed by the Seurat package in R software. PBMC subsets and cellular markers were defined after downscaling and clustering by the Harmony algorithm to identify characteristic subsets in the context of inflammatory stress. Subsequently, a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study was used to explore the causal associations of these inflammation-related PBMC subsets and their molecular phenotypes with delirium. Based on publicly available genetic data, the study incorporated 70 PBMC-associated immune traits, including 8 types of circulating immune cells, 33 B cell subsets and molecular phenotypes, 13 T cell subsets, and 16 B cell-associated cytokines. The results were also validated for robustness, heterogeneity, and horizontal pleiotropy. Results: Under LPS-induced inflammatory stress, B cells, T cells, monocytes, and dendritic cells in human PBMC showed significant activation and quantitative changes. Of these, only lymphocyte and B cell counts were causally associated with delirium risk. This risk link is also seen in the TNF pathway. Further studies of B cells and their subsets revealed that this association may be related to unswitched memory B cells and CD27 expressed on memory B cells. Annotation of the screened SNPs revealed significant polymorphisms in CD27 and CD40 annotated by rs25680 and rs9883798, respectively. The functions of the key annotated genes may be related to the regulation of immune responses, cell differentiation, proliferation, and intercellular interactions. Conclusion: The present study revealed the potential possibility that B cell, memory B cell subset, and TNF-related molecules may be involved in the development of delirium due to peripheral inflammation, which can provide clues for further investigation of delirium prevention and treatment strategies.
