38474867|a|The effectiveness of rehabilitation programs (RP) for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation remains controversial. However, few studies have investigated the combined effects of exercise and nutritional therapy. This study aimed to determine the effects of combined nutritional therapy on the physical function and nutritional status of patients with COPD exacerbation who underwent early RP. A randomized controlled trial was conducted in patients hospitalized for COPD exacerbations. Patients were assigned to receive a regular diet in addition to RP (control group) or RP and nutrition therapy (intervention group). Physical function, including quadricep strength and body composition, was assessed. The intervention group was administered protein-rich oral nutritional supplements. A total of 38 patients with negligible baseline differences were included in the analysis. The intervention group showed a notably greater change in quadriceps strength. Lean body mass and skeletal muscle indices markedly decreased in the control group but were maintained in the intervention group. Logistic regression analysis identified nutritional therapy as a significant factor associated with increased muscle strength. No serious adverse events were observed in either group. Therefore, nutritional therapy combined with RP is safe and effective for improving exercise function while maintaining body composition in patients with COPD exacerbation.
