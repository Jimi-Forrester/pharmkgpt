36004290|a|Objectives: Covert stroke is a complication of coronary artery bypass graft surgery that is increasingly recognized as a serious problem. In noncardiac surgery settings, covert stroke is associated with the development of delirium, long-term cognitive decline, and future clinical stroke. Therefore, we sought to determine the feasibility of conducting a large, prospective cohort study of the influence of covert stroke on neurocognitive outcomes in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Methods: NeuroVISION Cardiac pilot was a prospective cohort study enrolling patients aged >=21 years undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass graft surgery to receive diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging of the brain after surgery to identify patients with covert stroke. Patients were screened for postoperative delirium in-hospital and were administered questionnaires of cognitive and global function (once before and twice after surgery). Regional cerebral oxygen saturation was recorded during surgery using near-infrared spectroscopy. Results: Between March 27, 2017, and February 11, 2018, 50 of 66 patients enrolled (76%) completed the brain magnetic resonance imaging (1 patient per week). Among the 49 patients included in the analysis, 19 (39%; 95% confidence interval, 26%-53%) experienced perioperative covert stroke and 3 (6%) had a clinical stroke within 30 days of surgery. Postoperative delirium occurred in 5 (26%) patients with covert stroke and in 3 (10%) patients who did not experience covert stroke. Conclusions: The NeuroVISION Cardiac pilot study established the feasibility of conducting a large, prospective cohort study of the determinants and consequences of covert stroke in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery.
