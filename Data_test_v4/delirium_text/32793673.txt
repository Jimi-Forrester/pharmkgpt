32793673|a|Despite progress in the medical and device therapy for heart failure (HF), the prognosis for those with advanced HF remains poor. Acute heart failure (AcHF) is the rapid development of, or worsening of symptoms and signs of HF typically leading to hospitalization. Whilst many HF decompensations are managed at a ward-based level, a proportion of patients require higher acuity care in the intensive care unit (ICU). Admission to ICU is associated with a higher risk of in-hospital mortality, and in those who fail to respond to standard supportive and medical therapy, a proportion maybe suitable for mechanical circulatory support (MCS). The optimal pre-operative management of advanced HF patients awaiting durable MCS or cardiac transplantation (CTx) is vital in improving both short and longer-term outcomes. This review will summarize the clinical assessment, hemodynamic profiling and management of the patient with AcHF in the ICU. The general principles of pre-surgical optimization encompassing individual systems (the kidneys, the liver, blood and glycemic control) will be discussed. Other factors impacting upon post-operative outcomes including nutrition and sarcopenia and pre-surgical skin decolonization have been included. Issues specific to durable MCS including the assessment of the right ventricle and strategies for optimization will also be discussed.
