Around (77%) of these patients suffer from pain during their stay in critical care units. Undertreated pain aggravates anxiety, sleep deprivation, agitation, delirium, and depression that often lead to a chronic condition. There are various barriers toward recognition and proper management of pain such as sedation, the presence of endotracheal tube, healthcare providers lack of knowledge etc. Therefore, it becomes essential for the nurses to have the required knowledge related to pain, valid pain assessment tools, and proper management.
