36319677|a|This investigation aimed to quantitatively measure the changes in inflammation of subjects with healthy and unhealthy gums during a period of induced gingivitis. A total of 30 subjects (15 healthy, 15 with gum inflammation) were enlisted and given oral exams by a dental hygienist. Baseline measurements were acquired before a 3-week period of oral hygiene abstinence. The lobene modified gingival index scoring was used for inflammation scoring and hyperspectral spatial frequency domain imaging was used to quantitatively measure oxy- and deoxygenated blood volume fraction at two time points: at Baseline and after 3 weeks of oral hygiene abstinence. We found that abstaining from oral hygiene causes a near proportional increase in oxygenated and deoxygenated blood volume fraction for healthy individuals. For individuals who started the study with mild to moderate gingivitis, increases in blood volume were mainly due to deoxygenated blood.
