11765860|a|PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to reveal risk factors contributing to the development of depression among caregivers of Alzheimer's disease patients. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, all caregivers of consecutive Alzheimer's disease patients were asked to participate in the study. Patient and caregiver depression was evaluated by using the Yesavage Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). Information regarding patients' functional status, driving status, and type of behavioral abnormalities was obtained from caregivers. Patients' functional status was evaluated by using the Katz Activity of Daily Living (ADL) scale. The Folstein Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) was used to evaluate cognition. Risk factors for Alzheimer's caregiver depression were assessed by means of logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: A total of 92 patients and caregivers were evaluated. Fifteen were excluded due to incomplete data. A total of 77 pairs were included in this analysis. The age of caregivers ranged from 28 to 88 years. Mean (standard deviation [SD]) age was 63.1 (SD = 16.3) years old. Husbands and wives (caregivers) accounted for 49.4 percent; daughters or sons (or daughters- or sons-in-law) accounted for 42.9 percent. There were 29 caregivers (38 percent) found to be depressed. By using multivariate analysis, the following factors have been identified as risk factors for depression in Alzheimer 's caregivers: depression in the dementia patient; ADL functional scores of 12 or greater; and the presence of hallucinations. CONCLUSION: Three risk factors were found to have a strong association with Alzheimer's caregiver depression. Early recognition of such risk factors may help to identify Alzheimer's caregivers with depression.
