33800674|t|Nanoscale Metal-Organic Frameworks as Fluorescence Sensors for Food Safety.
33800674|a|Food safety has attracted attention worldwide, and how to detect various kinds of hazardous substances in an efficient way has always been a focus. Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) are a class of hybrid porous materials formed by organic ligand and metal ions. Nanoscale MOFs (NMOFs) exhibit great potential in serving as fluorescence sensors for food safety due to their superior properties including high accuracy, great stability, fast response, etc. In this review, we focus on the recent development of NMOFs sensing for food safety. Several typical methods of NMOFs synthesis are presented. NMOFs-based fluorescence sensors for contaminants and adulterants, such as antibiotics, food additives, ions and mycotoxin etc. are summarized, and the sensing mechanisms are also presented. We explore these challenges in detail and provide suggestions about how they may be surmounted. This review could help the exploration of NMOFs sensors in food related work.
