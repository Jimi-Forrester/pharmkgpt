652900|t|A reappraisal of alcoholic psychoses.
652900|a|A retrospective study of alcoholic psychoses is reported. The phenomena of the illnesses corresponded poorly with classical descriptions of alcoholic hallucinosis, delirium tremens and alcoholic paranoia. Alternative diagnostic approaches were tried (Catego, restrictive definition of alcoholic hallucinosis). The problems of distinguishing psychoses with associated organic factors from 'idiopathic' forms are discussed.
