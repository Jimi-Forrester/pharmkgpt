22897394|t|Administration of donepezil does not rescue galanin-induced spatial learning deficits.
22897394|a|The neuropeptide galanin inhibits the evoked release of several neurotransmitters including acetylcholine and modulates adenylate cyclase (AC) activity. Galanin has also been established to impair various forms of learning and memory in rodents. However, whether galanin produces learning deficits by inhibiting cholinergic activity or decreasing AC function has not been clearly established. The current study investigated if donepezil, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor utilized in Alzheimer's disease, could rescue galanin-induced Morris water task deficits in rats. The results demonstrated that donepezil did not alter the previously established deficits induced by galanin. These findings suggest that galanin-mediated spatial learning deficits may be unrelated to its modulation of the cholinergic system.
