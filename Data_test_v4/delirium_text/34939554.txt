34939554|t|Nanotechnological Advances in the Treatment of Epilepsy.
34939554|a|Epilepsy is known as one of the major challenges for medical science. The sudden appearance of a seizure has been a significant health emergency as it may lead to further complications. Although key advancements have been achieved in terms of pharmacological approaches for epilepsy, many issues remain uncertain. Lipid carriers have been at the forefront, especially in neurodegenerative diseases, such as epilepsy, Alzheimer's, dementia, etc. The blood-brain barrier still appears to be a major impediment in the successful treatment of epileptic seizures. This is mainly due to the limited bioavailability of most anti-convulsant drugs. The present review encompasses the issues underlying the current approach for epilepsy drug treatment and highlights the newer, novel, and more precise drug delivery system to manage seizures. The advantage of using a lipidbased delivery system is its superior absorption in the brain cells. Ample evidence shows that reducing the particle size also infuses the drug easily through the blood-brain barrier. The application of liposomes, polymeric nanoparticles, metallic nanoparticles, and solid lipid nanoparticles for the treatment and management of epilepsy has been highlighted in the present review. This review provides an overview of the current status of the treatment and recent advances in the treatment of epilepsy.
