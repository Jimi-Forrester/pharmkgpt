37515456|a|BACKGROUND: Exposure to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen (IBU) and naproxen (NAP) is associated with idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury (DILI). Carboxylate bioactivation into reactive metabolites (e.g., acyl glucuronides, AG) and resulting T-cell activation is hypothesized as causal for this adverse event. However, conclusive evidence supporting this is lacking. METHODS: In this work, we identify CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell hepatic infiltration in a biopsy from an IBU DILI patient. Lymphocyte transformation test and IFN-gamma ELIspot, conducted on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients with NAP-DILI, were used to explore drug-specific T-cell activation. T-cell clones (TCC) were generated and tested for drug specificity, phenotype/function, and pathways of T-cell activation. Cells were exposed to NAP, its oxidative metabolite 6-O-desmethyl NAP (DM-NAP), its AG or synthesized NAP-AG human-serum albumin adducts (NAP-AG adduct). RESULTS: CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells from patients expressing a range of different Vbeta receptors were stimulated to proliferate and secrete IFN-gamma and IL-22 when exposed to DM-NAP, but not NAP, NAP-AG or the NAP-AG adduct. Activation of the CD4+ TCC was HLA-DQ-restricted and dependent on antigen presenting cells (APC); most TCC were activated with DM-NAP-pulsed APC, while fixation of APC blocked the T-cell response. Cross-reactivity was not observed with structurally-related drugs. CONCLUSION: Our results confirm hepatic T-cell infiltrations in NSAID-induced DILI, and show a T-cell memory response toward DM-NAP indicating an immune-mediated basis for the adverse event. Whilst bioactivation at the carboxylate group is widely hypothesized to be pathogenic for NSAID associated DILI, we found no evidence of this with NAP.
