37399991|t|Identification of Tau-Tubulin Kinase 1 Inhibitors by Microfluidics-based Mobility Shift Assay from a Kinase Inhibitor Library.
37399991|a|Tau tubulin kinase 1 (TTBK1) is a serine/threonine/tyrosine kinase that phosphorylates multiple residues in tau protein. Hyperphosphorylated tau is the main cause of tauopathy, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Therefore, preventing tau phosphorylation by inhibiting TTBK1 has been proposed as a therapeutic strategy for AD. However, few substrates of TTBK1 are reported for a biochemical assay and few inhibitors targeting TTBK1 have been reported so far. In this study, we identified a fluorescein amidite (FAM)-labeled peptide 15 from a small peptide library as the optimal peptide substrate for human TTBK1 (hTTBK1). We then developed and validated a microfluidics-based mobility shift assay (MMSA) with peptide 15. We further confirmed that peptide 15 could also be used in the ADP-Glo kinase assay. The established MMSA was applied for screening of a 427-compound kinase inhibitor library, yielding five compounds with IC50s of several micro molars against hTTBK1. Among them, three compounds, AZD5363, A-674563 and GSK690693 inhibited hTTBK1 in an ATP competitive manner and molecular docking simulations revealed that they enter the ATP pocket and form one or two hydrogen bonds to the hinge region with hTTBK1. Another hit compound, piceatannol, showed non-ATP competitive inhibitory effect on hTTBK1 and may serve as a starting point to develop highly selective hTTBK1 inhibitors. Altogether, this study provided a new in vitro platform for the development of novel hTTBK1 inhibitors that might have potential applications in AD prevention.
