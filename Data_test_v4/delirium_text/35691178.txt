35691178|t|Are there morphological differences between Parkinson's disease-dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies?
35691178|a|Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) are two major neurocognitive disorders in the spectrum of Lewy body diseases that overlap in many clinical and neuropathological features, although they show several differences. Clinically distinguished mainly based on the duration of parkinsonism prior to development of dementia, their morphology is characterized by a variable combination of Lewy body (LB) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathologies, the latter usually being more frequent and severe in DLB. OBJECTIVE: The aims of the study were to investigate essential neuropathological differences between PDD and DLB in a larger cohort of autopsy cases. METHODS: 110 PDD autopsy cases were compared with 78 DLB cases. The major demographic, clinical (duration of illness, final MMSE) and neuropathological data were assessed retrospectively. Neuropathological studies used standardized methods and immunohistochemistry for phospho-tau, beta-amyloid (Ass) and alpha-synuclein, with semiquantitative assessment of the major histological lesions. RESULTS: PDD patients were significantly older at death than DLB ones (mean 83.9 vs. 79.8 years), with a significantly longer disease duration (mean 9.2 vs. 6.7 years). Braak LB scores and particularly neuritic Braak stages were significantly higher in the DLB group (mean 5.1and 5.1 vs. 4.2 and 4.4, respectively), as were Thal Abeta phases (mean 4.1 vs. 3.0). Diffuse striatal Abeta plaques were considerable in 55% and moderate in 45% of DLB cases, but were extremely rare in PDD. The most significant differences concerned the frequency and degree of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), being significantly higher in DLB (98.7 vs. 50%, and mean degree of 2.9 vs. 0.72, respectively). Worse prognosis in DLB than in PDD was linked to both increased Braak neuritic stages and more severe CAA. INTERPRETATION: These and other recent studies imply the association of CAA, more severe concomitant AD pathology, and striatal Abeta load with cognitive decline and more rapid disease process that distinguishes DLB from PDD, while the influence of other cerebrovascular diseases or co-pathologies in both disorders was not specifically examined. The importance of both CAA and tau pathology in DLB and much less in PDD supports the concept of a pathogenetic continuum from Parkinson's disease (PD) - > PDD - > DLB - > DLB + AD and subtypes of AD with LB pathology within the spectrum of age-related proteinopathies.
