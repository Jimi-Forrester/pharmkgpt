38068731|t|Oxidative Status of Ultra-Processed Foods in the Western Diet.
38068731|a|Ultra-processed foods (UPFs) have gained substantial attention in the scientific community due to their surging consumption and potential health repercussions. In addition to their well-established poor nutritional profile, UPFs have been implicated in containing various dietary oxidized sterols (DOxSs). These DOxSs are associated with a spectrum of chronic diseases, including cardiometabolic conditions, cancer, diabetes, Parkinson's, and Alzheimer's disease. In this study, we present a comprehensive database documenting the presence of DOxSs and other dietary metabolites in >60 UPFs commonly consumed as part of the Western diet. Significant differences were found in DOxS and phytosterol content between ready-to-eat (RTE) and fast foods (FFs). Biomarker analysis revealed that DOxS accumulation, particularly 25-OH and triol, can potentially discriminate between RTEs and FFs. This work underscores the potential utility of dietary biomarkers in early disease detection and prevention. However, an essential next step is conducting exposure assessments to better comprehend the levels of DOxS exposure and their association with chronic diseases.
