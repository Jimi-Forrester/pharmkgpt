36556373|t|Promiscuous Receptors and Neuroinflammation: The Formyl Peptide Class.
36556373|a|Formyl peptide receptors, abbreviated as FPRs in humans, are G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) mainly found in mammalian leukocytes. However, they are also expressed in cell types crucial for homeostatic brain regulation, including microglia and blood-brain barrier endothelial cells. Thus, the roles of these immune-associated receptors are extensive, from governing cellular adhesion and directed migration through chemotaxis, to granule release and superoxide formation, to phagocytosis and efferocytosis. In this review, we will describe the similarities and differences between the two principal pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory FPRs, FPR1 and FPR2, and the evidence for their importance in the development of neuroinflammatory disease, alongside their potential as therapeutic targets.
