39075445|t|Bioelectrical impedance phase angle combined with physical function predicts pre-frailty in maintenance hemodialysis patients: a prospective study.
39075445|a|BACKGROUND: The prevalence of pre-frailty is notably high among maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients. Pre-frailty, an early and reversible condition between non-frailty and frailty, can lead to adverse outcomes such as increased unplanned hospital admissions and a higher risk of other chronic diseases. Early identification and intervention of pre-frailty in MHD patients are crucial. This study aimed to establish a simple and effective model for screening and identifying MHD patients at high risk of pre-frailty by using 50 kHz-Whole Body Phase Angle (PhA) measured by bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), hand grip strength (HGS), the Five-Times-Sit-to-Stand Test (FTSST), and laboratory parameters, with a specific focus on gender differences. METHODS: This prospective cross-sectional study was conducted from September to December 2023 at the Wenjiang Hemodialysis Center in the Department of Nephrology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China. A total of 244 MHD patients, including 130 males and 114 females, were enrolled, comprising 128 non-frail and 116 pre-frail individuals. Data were collected prospectively, including demographic information, physical measurements, and laboratory test results. All participants provided informed consent before enrollment. The FRAIL scale (FS) was used to assess pre-frailty in MHD patients. Grip strength was measured using an electronic grip strength tester, physical function was assessed using the Five-Times-Sit-to-Stand Test, and whole-body phase angle was measured using the InBody S10 device. RESULTS: A total of 244 MHD patients with a mean age of 53.75 +- 0.90 years were enrolled, including 130 males with a mean age of 54.12 +- 1.26 years and 114 females with a mean age of 53.32 +- 1.29 years. ROC curve analysis showed that in male patients, the AUC of PhA for predicting pre-frailty was 0.919, with a sensitivity of 94.5% and specificity of 91.3%, and a cutoff value of 6.05 ; in female patients, the AUC of PhA was 0.870, with a sensitivity of 70.5% and specificity of 90.6%, and a cutoff value of 5.25 . The AUC of FTSST for screening pre-frailty in male patients was 0.827, with a sensitivity of 62.3% and specificity of 96.2%, and a cutoff value of 12.95 s; in female patients, the AUC of FTSST was 0.784, with a sensitivity of 67.3% and specificity of 84.0%, and a cutoff value of 12.95 s. Additionally, in male patients, the combination of PhA and FTSST resulted in an AUC of 0.930, with a sensitivity of 96.4% and specificity of 81.3%; in female patients, the AUC was 0.911, with a sensitivity of 78.7% and specificity of 92.5%. CONCLUSION: PhA measured by BIA, in combination with the Five-Times-Sit-to-Stand Test, serves as an effective screening tool and predictor of pre-frailty in MHD patients. The combination of PhA and FTSST shows enhanced diagnostic value in female patients, while PhA alone is sufficient for predicting pre-frailty in male patients.
