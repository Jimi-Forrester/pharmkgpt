1749211|a|Enzymes involved with the metabolic transformation of xenobiotics have recently been studied in patients with the neurodegenerative diseases, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and motor neurone disease. Defects were detected in sulphur pathways and also, in the case of Parkinson's disease, in monoamine oxidase B. The possibility exists that the ability to cope safely with endogenous and exogenous substances which have neurotoxic properties is important in the pathogenesis of these diseases. Potentially such individuals could be identified preclinically and these diseases postponed by reduction in the load of toxin or modification of the relevant enzymic activity.
