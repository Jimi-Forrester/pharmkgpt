24669873|t|Interaction between prion protein and Abeta amyloid fibrils revisited.
24669873|a|Recent studies indicate that the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease may be related to the interaction between prion protein (PrP) and certain oligomeric species of Abeta peptide. However, the mechanism of this interaction remains unclear and controversial. Here we provide direct experimental evidence that, in addition to previously demonstrated binding to Abeta oligomers, PrP also interacts with mature Abeta fibrils. However, contrary to the recent claim that PrP causes fragmentation of Abeta fibrils into oligomeric species, no evidence for such a disassembly could be detected in the present study. In contrast, our data indicate that the addition of PrP to preformed Abeta fibrils results in a lateral association of individual fibrils into larger bundles. These findings have potentially important implications for understanding the mechanism by which PrP might impact Abeta toxicity as well as for the emerging efforts to use PrP-derived compounds as inhibitors of Abeta-induced neurodegeneration.
