33518384|a|Various autoimmune diseases are associated with defects in protein degradation and NETosis. This review aims to examine defects in ubiquitination and NETosis and their associations with human disease. This study involved a systematic search of electronic databases, including PubMed, EBSCO, and LILACS, to locate articles on the relationship between human disease and defects in protein degradation and NETosis. Ubiquitination and NETosis can trigger a cascade of events that affect immune system function and impact the body's ability to fight disease. Ubiquitination is implicated in various disorders, such as Liddle's syndrome, Alzheimer's disease, and other neurodegenerative disorders, whereas NETosis has been linked to antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody associated vasculitis, accelerated atherosclerosis, thrombosis, rheumatoid arthritis, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, type 1 diabetes mellitus, and renal inflammatory complications. Researchers have attempted for years to identify the link between neurodegenerative disease and ubiquitination. Previous studies analysed the relationships between different autoimmune disorders and NETosis and identified various ubiquitin conjugates and NET remnants that trigger disease development and progression. Ubiquitination and NETosis play key roles in the emergence and progression of neurodegenerative and autoimmune disorders. Further investigation is needed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the relationships between these disorders and biological processes.
