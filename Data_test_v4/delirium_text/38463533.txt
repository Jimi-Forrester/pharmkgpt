38463533|t|Evaluating the effectiveness and underlying mechanisms of incretin-based treatments for hypothalamic obesity: A narrative review.
38463533|a|Background: Hypothalamic obesity represents a clinical condition within the broader spectrum of obesity that frequently eludes detection and appropriate diagnosis. This subset of obesity is characterized by a dearth of established predictive markers and a paucity of standardized therapeutic protocols. The advent and rising prominence of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists in the obesity treatment landscape present novel therapeutic avenues for hypothalamic obesity management. Nonetheless, critical inquiries persist concerning the efficacy of GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists in this context, particularly regarding their central mechanisms of action and specific impact on hypothalamic obesity. Methods: In this narrative review, we concentrate on analyzing research papers that delineate the detection and function of GLP-1 receptors across various hypothalamic and cerebral regions. Additionally, we examine clinical research papers and reports detailing the application of GLP-1 receptor agonists in treating hypothalamic obesity. Furthermore, we include a concise presentation of a clinical case from our unit for contextual understanding. Results: Currently, the clinical evidence supporting the efficacy of GLP-1 receptor agonists in hypothalamic obesity, as well as the diverse characteristics of this obesity subtype, remains insufficient. Preliminary data suggest that GLP-1R agonists might offer an effective treatment option, albeit with variable outcomes, particularly in younger patient cohorts. From a mechanistic perspective, the presence of GLP-1 receptors in various hypothalamic and broader brain regions potentially underpins the efficacy of GLP-1R agonists, even in instances of hypothalamic damage. Nevertheless, additional research is imperative to establish the functional relevance of these receptors in said brain regions. Conclusion: GLP-1R agonists represent a potential therapeutic option for patients with hypothalamic obesity. However, further clinical and basic/translational research is essential to validate the efficacy of these drugs across different presentations of hypothalamic obesity and to understand the functionality of GLP-1R in the diverse brain regions where they are expressed.
