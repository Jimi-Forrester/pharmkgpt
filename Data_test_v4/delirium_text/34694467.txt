34694467|a|The devastating COVID-19 pandemic is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. It primarily affects the lung and induces acute respiratory distress leading to a decrease in oxygen supply to the cells. This lung insufficiency caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus contributes to hypoxia which can affect the brain and other organ systems. The heightened cytokine storm in COVID-19 patients leads to an immune reaction in the vascular endothelial cells that compromise the host defenses against the SARS-CoV-2 virus in various organs. The vascular endothelial cell membrane breach allows access for SARS-CoV-2 to infect multiple tissues and organs. The neurotropism of spike protein in SARS-CoV-2 rendered by furin site insertion may increase neuronal infections. These could result in encephalitis and encephalopathy. The COVID-19 patients suffered severe lung deficiency often showed effects in the brain and neural system. The early symptoms include headache, loss of smell, mental confusion, psychiatric disorders and strokes, and rarely encephalitis, which indicated the vulnerability of the nervous system to SARS-CoV-2. Infection of the brain and peripheral nervous system can lead to the dysfunction of other organs and result in multi-organ failure. This review focuses on discussing the vulnerability of the nervous system based on the pattern of expression of the receptors for the SARS-CoV-2 and the mechanisms of its cell invasion. The SARS-CoV-2 elicited immune response and host immune response evasion are further discussed. Then the effects on the nervous system and its consequences on neuro-sensory functions are discussed. Finally, the emerging information on the overall genetic susceptibility seen in COVID-19 patients and its implications for therapy outlook is discussed.
