37545321|a|AIMS: Adult hippocampal neurogenesis is an important player in brain homeostasis and its impairment participates in neurological diseases. Iron overload has emerged as an irreversible factor of brain aging, and is also closely related to degenerative disorders, including cognitive dysfunction. However, whether brain iron overload alters hippocampal neurogenesis has not been reported. We investigated the effect of elevated iron content on adult hippocampal neurogenesis and explored the underlying mechanism. METHODS: Mouse models with hippocampal iron overload were generated. Neurogenesis in hippocampus and expression levels of related molecules were assessed. RESULTS: Iron accumulation in hippocampus remarkably impaired the differentiation of neural stem cells, resulting in a significant decrease in newborn neurons. The damage was possibly attributed to iron-induced downregulation of proprotein convertase furin and subsequently decreased maturation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), thus contributing to memory decline and anxiety-like behavior of mice. Supportively, knockdown of furin indeed suppressed hippocampal neurogenesis, while furin overexpression restored the impairment. CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrated that iron overload damaged hippocampal neurogenesis likely via iron-furin-BDNF pathway. This study provides new insights into potential mechanisms on iron-induced neurotoxicity and the causes of neurogenesis injury and renders modulating iron homeostasis and furin expression as novel therapeutic strategies for treatment of neurological diseases.
