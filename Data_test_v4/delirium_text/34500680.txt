34500680|a|The pharmacokinetic (PK) change in a drug by co-administered herbal products can alter the efficacy and toxicity. In the circumstances that herb-drug combinations have been increasingly attempted to alleviate Alzheimer's disease (AD), the PK evaluation of herb-drug interaction (HDI) is necessary. The change in systemic exposure as well as target tissue distribution of the drug have been issued in HDIs. Recently, the memory-enhancing effects of water extract of mangosteen pericarp (WMP) has been reported, suggesting a potential for the combination of WMP and donepezil (DNP) for AD treatment. Thus, it was evaluated how WMP affects the PK change of donepezil, including systemic exposure and tissue distribution in mice after simultaneous oral administration of DNP with WMP. Firstly, co-treatment of WMP and donepezil showed a stronger inhibitory effect (by 23.0%) on the neurotoxicity induced by Abeta(25-35) in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells than donepezil alone, suggesting that the combination of WMP and donepezil may be more effective in moderating neurotoxicity than donepezil alone. In PK interaction, WMP increased donepezil concentration in the brain at 4 h (by 63.6%) after administration without affecting systemic exposure of donepezil. Taken together, our results suggest that WMP might be used in combination with DNP as a therapy for AD.
