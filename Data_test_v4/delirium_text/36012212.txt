36012212|t|Immunofluorescent Evidence for Nuclear Localization of Aromatase in Astrocytes in the Rat Central Nervous System.
36012212|a|Estrogens regulate a variety of neuroendocrine, reproductive and also non-reproductive brain functions. Estradiol biosynthesis in the central nervous system (CNS) is catalyzed by the enzyme aromatase, which is expressed in several brain regions by neurons, astrocytes and microglia. In this study, we performed a complex fluorescent immunocytochemical analysis which revealed that aromatase is colocalized with the nuclear stain in glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) positive astrocytes in cell cultures. Confocal immunofluorescent Z-stack scanning analysis confirmed the colocalization of aromatase with the nuclear DAPI signal. Nuclear aromatase was also detectable in the S100beta positive astrocyte subpopulation. When the nuclear aromatase signal was present, estrogen receptor alpha was also abundant in the nucleus. Immunostaining of frozen brain tissue sections showed that the nuclear colocalization of the enzyme in GFAP-positive astrocytes is also detectable in the adult rat brain. CD11b/c labelled microglial cells express aromatase, but the immunopositive signal was distributed only in the cytoplasm both in the ramified and amoeboid microglial forms. Immunostaining of rat ovarian tissue sections and human granulosa cells revealed that aromatase was present only in the cytoplasm. This novel observation suggests a new unique mechanism in astrocytes that may regulate certain CNS functions via estradiol production.
