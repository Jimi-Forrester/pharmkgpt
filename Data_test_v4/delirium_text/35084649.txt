35084649|a|PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to determine the influence of postanesthesia care unit (PACU) delirium on self-reported cognitive function and perceived health status 3 months after surgery. METHODS: This prospective observational cohort study was performed in a PACU at a high-volume prostate cancer center. We used a convenience sample of patients > 60 years undergoing elective radical prostatectomy. Patients with a history of cerebrovascular or neurodegenerative disease were excluded. Fifteen, 30, 45, and 60 following extubation, patients were screened for signs of delirium with the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit. Three months after surgery self-reported cognitive function was assessed with the Cognitive Failures Questionnaire, and health status was evaluated with the 36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36). RESULTS: Signs of PACU delirium were present in 32.4% (n = 72/222) of patients, and 80.2% (n = 178/222) completed the 3-month follow-up. The presence of PACU delirium signs was not significantly associated with self-reported cognitive failures (B = 0.60, 95% CI: -1.72; 2.92, p = 0.61) or SF-36 physical component scores (B = 0.19, 95% CI: 0.02; 0.36, p = 0.03) or SF-36 mental component scores (B =  -0.03, 95% CI: -0.18, 0.11, p = 0.66) 3 months after radical prostatectomy. CONCLUSIONS: In a cohort of educated, highly functioning, elderly male patients who were assessed immediately after surgery and at a 3-month follow-up, we found no association between PACU delirium and self-reported cognitive failures or perceived health status, which implies that PACU delirium may be an event of limited duration and impact. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier: NCT04168268, Date of registration: November 19, 2019).
