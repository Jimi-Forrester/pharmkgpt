29782323|t|Role of Blood-Brain Barrier in Alzheimer's Disease.
29782323|a|The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). BBB is a highly selective semipermeable structural and chemical barrier which ensures a stable internal environment of the brain and prevents foreign objects invading the brain tissue. BBB dysfunction induces the failure of Abeta transport from brain to the peripheral circulation across the BBB. Especially, decreased levels of LRP-1 (low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1) and increased levels of RAGE (receptor for advanced glycation endproducts) at the BBB can cause the failure of Abeta transport. The pathogenesis of AD is related to the BBB structural components, including pericytes, astrocytes, vascular endothelial cells, and tight junctions. BBB dysfunction will trigger neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, then enhance the activity of beta-secretase and gamma-secretase, and finally promote Abeta generation. A progressive accumulation of Abeta in brain and BBB dysfunction may become a feedback loop that gives rise to cognitive impairment and the onset of dementia. The correlation between BBB dysfunction and tau pathology has been well-reported. Therefore, regulating BBB function may be a new therapeutic target for treating AD.
