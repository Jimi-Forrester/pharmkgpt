35629488|t|Flake Graphene-Based Nanomaterial Approach for Triggering a Ferroptosis as an Attractive Theranostic Outlook for Tackling Non-Small Lung Cancer: A Mini Review.
35629488|a|Lung cancer is a highly aggressive neoplasm that is now a leading cause of cancer death worldwide. One of the major approaches for killing cancer cells is related with activation of apoptotic cell death with anti-cancer drugs. However, the efficiency of apoptosis induction in tumors is limited. Consequently, the development of other forms of non-apoptotic cell death is up to date challenge for scientists worldwide. This situation motivated us to define the aim of this mini-review: gathering knowledge regarding ferroptosis-newly defined programmed cell death process characterized by the excessive accumulation of iron-and combining it with yet another interesting nanomaterial-based graphene approach. In this manuscript, we presented brief information about non-small lung cancer and ferroptosis, followed by a section depicting the key-features of graphene-based nanomaterials influencing their biologically relevant properties.
