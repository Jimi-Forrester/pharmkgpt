Further, it remains unclear whether neurological manifestations are primarily due to neurotropism of the virus, or indirect effects, like cerebral hypoxia. METHODS: We analysed the electroencephalograms (EEGs) of 19 consecutive patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, performed at peak disease severity as part of their clinical management. Disease severity, respiratory failure, immune and metabolic dysfunction, sedation status, and neurological examination on the day of the EEG were noted. RESULTS: Severe encephalopathy was confirmed in 13 patients, all with severe COVID-19; 10 remained comatose off sedation, and five of them had alpha coma (AC). Disease severity, sedation, immune and metabolic dysfunction were not different between those with AC and those without. CONCLUSIONS: Severe COVID-19 encephalopathy is a principal cause of persisting coma after sedation withdrawal. The relatively high incidence of the rare AC pattern may reflect direct SARS-CoV-2 neurotropism with a predilection for the brainstem ascending reticular system. SIGNIFICANCE: Systematic early EEG detection of encephalopathy related to severe COVID-19 is important for the acute care and the management of long-term neurological and cognitive sequelae, and may help our better understanding of its pathophysiology.
