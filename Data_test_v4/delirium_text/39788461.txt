39788461|t|C/EBPbeta in Alzheimer's Disease: An Integrative Regulator of Pathological Mechanisms.
39788461|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) stands as one of the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorders, characterized by a progressive decline in cognitive function, neuroinflammation, amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques, and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). With the global aging population, the incidence of AD continues to rise, yet current therapeutic strategies remain limited in their ability to significantly alleviate cognitive impairments. Therefore, a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying AD is imperative for the development of more effective treatments. In recent years, the transcription factor C/EBPbeta has emerged as a pivotal regulator in several pathological processes of AD, including neuroinflammation, lipid metabolism, Abeta processing, and tau phosphorylation. Through intricate post-translational modifications, C/EBPbeta modulates these processes and may influence the progression of AD on multiple fronts. This review systematically explores the multifaceted roles of C/EBPbeta in the pathogenesis of AD, delving into its crucial involvement in neuroinflammation, Abeta production, tau pathology, and lipid metabolism dysregulation. Furthermore, we critically assess therapeutic strategies targeting C/EBPbeta, examining the challenges and opportunities in regulating this factor. By synthesizing the latest research findings, we offer a more comprehensive understanding of the role of C/EBPbeta in AD and discuss its potential as a therapeutic intervention target.
