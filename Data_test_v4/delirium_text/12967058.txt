12967058|a|Recent work on high plasma homocysteine levels in patients at risk for developing Alzheimer's disease has led to the hypothesis that folic acid supplementation might reduce risk in such patients. The authors report on the effects of folic acid 10 mg/day versus placebo on 11 patients (only 7 completers) with dementia and low-normal folic acid levels. This is the first study evaluating folic acid or placebo in patients with dementia. Subjects had low-normal baseline folic acid levels. The magnitude of change between baseline and second testing was not statistically significant between the 2 groups. However, there was a trend for the folate group to perform worse on two specific cognitive measures, suggesting a possible trend toward worsening of some cognitive abilities after the folic acid. The folic acid in very high doses was well tolerated. Larger studies are necessary before empirically administering folic acid to patients already suffering from dementia.
