The KP accounts for ~95% of dietary Trp degradation, of which 90% is attributed to the hepatic KP. During immune activation, the minor extrahepatic KP plays a more active role. The KP is rate-limited by its first enzyme, Trp 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO), in liver and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) elsewhere. TDO is regulated by glucocorticoid induction, substrate activation and stabilization by Trp, cofactor activation by heme, and end-product inhibition by reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate). IDO is regulated by IFN-gamma and other cytokines and by nitric oxide. The KP disposes of excess Trp, controls hepatic heme synthesis and Trp availability for cerebral serotonin synthesis, and produces immunoregulatory and neuroactive metabolites, the B3 \"vitamin\" nicotinic acid, and oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. Various KP enzymes are undermined in disease and are targeted for therapy of conditions ranging from immunological, neurological, and neurodegenerative conditions to cancer.\\n\\npmid: pmid36409557\\nDocument Text: BACKGROUNDThe kynurenine pathway (KP) has been identified as a potential mediator linking acute illness to cognitive dysfunction by generating neuroactive metabolites in response to inflammation. Delirium (acute confusion) is a common complication of acute illness and is associated with increased risk of dementia and mortality. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying delirium, particularly in relation to the KP, remain elusive.METHODSWe undertook a multicenter observational study with 586 hospitalized patients (248 with delirium) and investigated associations between delirium and KP metabolites measured in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum by targeted metabolomics. We also explored associations between KP metabolites and markers of neuronal damage and 1-year mortality.RESULTSIn delirium, we found concentrations of the neurotoxic metabolite quinolinic acid in CSF (CSF-QA) (OR 2.26 [1.78, 2.87], P < 0.001) to be increased and also found increases in several other KP metabolites in serum and CSF. In addition, CSF-QA was associated with the neuronal damage marker neurofilament light chain (NfL) (beta 0.43, P < 0.001) and was a strong predictor of 1-year mortality (HR 4.35 [2.93, 6.45] for CSF-QA >= 100 nmol/L, P < 0.001). The associations between CSF-QA and delirium, neuronal damage, and mortality remained highly significant following adjustment for confounders and multiple comparisons.CONCLUSIONOur data identified how systemic inflammation, neurotoxicity, and delirium are strongly linked via the KP and should inform future delirium prevention and treatment clinical trials that target enzymes of the KP.FUNDINGNorwegian Health Association and South-Eastern Norway Regional Health Authorities.\\n\\npmid: pmid36647830\\nDocument Text: Tryptophan (Trp) metabolism plays a central role in sleep, mood, and immune system regulation.

Based on psychomotor presentations, delirium has three main subtypes, such as hypoactive, hyperactive, and mixed subtype.

The KP accounts for ~95% of dietary Trp degradation, of which 90% is attributed to the hepatic KP. During immune activation, the minor extrahepatic KP plays a more active role. The KP is rate-limited by its first enzyme, Trp 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO), in liver and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) elsewhere. TDO is regulated by glucocorticoid induction, substrate activation and stabilization by Trp, cofactor activation by heme, and end-product inhibition by reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate). IDO is regulated by IFN-gamma and other cytokines and by nitric oxide. The KP disposes of excess Trp, controls hepatic heme synthesis and Trp availability for cerebral serotonin synthesis, and produces immunoregulatory and neuroactive metabolites, the B3 \"vitamin\" nicotinic acid, and oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. Various KP enzymes are undermined in disease and are targeted for therapy of conditions ranging from immunological, neurological, and neurodegenerative conditions to cancer.',\n",

       " 'pmid36409557': {'abstract': 'BACKGROUNDThe kynurenine pathway (KP) has been identified as a potential mediator linking acute illness to cognitive dysfunction by generating neuroactive metabolites in response to inflammation. Delirium (acute confusion) is a common complication of acute illness and is associated with increased risk of dementia and mortality. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying delirium, particularly in relation to the KP, remain elusive.METHODSWe undertook a multicenter observational study with 586 hospitalized patients (248 with delirium) and investigated associations between delirium and KP metabolites measured in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum by targeted metabolomics. We also explored associations between KP metabolites and markers of neuronal damage and 1-year mortality.RESULTSIn delirium, we found concentrations of the neurotoxic metabolite quinolinic acid in CSF (CSF-QA) (OR 2.26 [1.78, 2.87], P < 0.001) to be increased and also found increases in several other KP metabolites in serum and CSF. In addition, CSF-QA was associated with the neuronal damage marker neurofilament light chain (NfL) (beta 0.43, P < 0.001) and was a strong predictor of 1-year mortality (HR 4.35 [2.93, 6.45] for CSF-QA >= 100 nmol/L, P < 0.001). The associations between CSF-QA and delirium, neuronal damage, and mortality remained highly significant following adjustment for confounders and multiple comparisons.CONCLUSIONOur data identified how systemic inflammation, neurotoxicity, and delirium are strongly linked via the KP and should inform future delirium prevention and treatment clinical trials that target enzymes of the KP.FUNDINGNorwegian Health Association and South-Eastern Norway Regional Health Authorities.',\n",

       " 'pmid36647830': {'abstract': 'Tryptophan (Trp) metabolism plays a central role in sleep, mood, and immune system regulation. The kynurenine pathway (KP), which is regulated by the enzymes tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO) and indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase (IDO), which catalyze the conversion of Trp to kynurenine (Kyn), facilitates immune regulation and influences neurocognition. Notably, Kyn metabolites bind the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR), essential for memory encoding, and in turn, cognition. Aberrant NMDAR activity through agonist binding influences excitability and cell death. In this issue of the JCI, Watne and authors demonstrate that KP pathway end products were elevated in the serum and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of subjects with delirium. This observation provides insight regarding the basis of a variety of commonly observed clinical conditions including sundowning, abnormal sleep-wake cycles in hospitalized patients, neurodegenerative cognitive impairment, radiation-induced cognitive impairment, neurocognitive symptomatology related to COVID-19, and clinical outcomes observed in patients with CNS tumors, such as gliomas.',\n",

       " 'pmid36982655': {'abstract': 'Delirium, a common form of acute brain dysfunction, is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, especially in older patients. The underlying pathophysiology of delirium is not clearly understood, but acute systemic inflammation is known to drive delirium in cases of acute illnesses, such as sepsis, trauma, and surgery. Based on psychomotor presentations, delirium has three main subtypes, such as hypoactive, hyperactive, and mixed subtype. There are similarities in the initial presentation of delirium with depression and dementia, especially in the hypoactive subtype. Hence, patients with hypoactive delirium are frequently misdiagnosed. The altered kynurenine pathway (KP) is a promising molecular pathway implicated in the pathogenesis of delirium. The KP is highly regulated in the immune system and influences neurological functions. <mark>The activation of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, and specific KP neuroactive metabolites, such as quinolinic acid and kynurenic acid, could play a role in the event of delirium.</mark> Here, we collectively describe the roles of the KP and speculate on its relevance in delirium.',\n",
