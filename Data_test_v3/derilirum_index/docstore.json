Animation-based learning has shown promise in patient education. We collaborated with educators and support staff at Alzheimer's Association Connecticut (AACT) to conduct a mixed-methods study and develop an animated e-curriculum addressing pandemic related challenges. METHODS: We conducted focus groups and surveys with dementia and caregiver educators and support staff at AACT for the initial needs assessment and the later e-curriculum evaluation. An interdisciplinary team of educators followed a step-wise process to transform the needs assessment results into an animation based e-curriculum. RESULTS: Participants identified the following pandemic challenges: 1) social isolation, 2) caregiver fatigue, 3) safety, and 4) difficulty navigating the healthcare system. The overall quality and usefulness of the e-curriculum was \"very good\" or \"excellent\". CONCLUSIONS: An animated e-curriculum addressing pandemic related issues relevant to adults with dementia and caregivers had positive reviews and was associated with improvement in self-reported ability to perform curriculum objectives among community dementia educators. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: The pandemic challenges identified may facilitate the development of further resources. Additionally, this project may serve as a guide for clinicians interested in incorporating animation into education efforts.\n.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cognitive impairment": {"__data__": {"id_": "cognitive impairment", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "cognitive impairment", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "pmid28207841": {"__data__": {"id_": "pmid28207841", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "pmid28207841: Title: Barriers and enablers to the implementation of the 6-PACK falls prevention program: A pre-implementation study in hospitals participating in a cluster randomised controlled trial.\n Abstract: Evidence for effective falls prevention interventions in acute wards is limited. One reason for this may be suboptimal program implementation. This study aimed to identify perceived barriers and enablers of the implementation of the 6-PACK falls prevention program to inform the implementation in a randomised controlled trial. Strategies to optimise successful implementation of 6-PACK were also sought. A mixed-methods approach was applied in 24 acute wards from 6 Australian hospitals. Participants were nurses working on participating wards and senior hospital staff including Nurse Unit Managers; senior physicians; Directors of Nursing; and senior personnel involved in quality and safety or falls prevention. Information on barriers and enablers of 6-PACK implementation was obtained through surveys, focus groups and interviews. Questions reflected the COM-B framework that includes three behaviour change constructs of: capability, opportunity and motivation. Focus group and interview data were analysed thematically, and survey data descriptively. The survey response rate was 60% (420/702), and 12 focus groups (n = 96 nurses) and 24 interviews with senior staff were conducted. Capability barriers included beliefs that falls could not be prevented; and limited knowledge on falls prevention in patients with complex care needs (e.g. cognitive impairment). Capability enablers included education and training, particularly face to face case study based approaches. Lack of resources was identified as an opportunity barrier. Leadership, champions and using data to drive practice change were recognised as opportunity enablers. Motivation barriers included complacency and lack of ownership in falls prevention efforts. Motivation enablers included senior staff articulating clear goals and a commitment to falls prevention; and use of reminders, audits and feedback. The information gained from this study suggests that regular practical face-to-face education and training for nurses; provision of equipment; audit, reminders and feedback; leadership and champions; and the provision of falls data is key to successful falls prevention program implementation in acute hospitals.\n.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "falls": {"__data__": {"id_": "falls", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "falls", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fto": {"__data__": {"id_": "fto", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "fto", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "tcf7l2": {"__data__": {"id_": "tcf7l2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "tcf7l2", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "type 2 diabetes mellitus": {"__data__": {"id_": "type 2 diabetes mellitus", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "type 2 diabetes mellitus", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "hypothyroidism": {"__data__": {"id_": "hypothyroidism", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "hypothyroidism", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "hla drb1": {"__data__": {"id_": "hla drb1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "hla drb1", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "pmid32974638": {"__data__": {"id_": "pmid32974638", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "pmid32974638: Title: PheMap: a multi-resource knowledge base for high-throughput phenotyping within electronic health records.\n Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Developing algorithms to extract phenotypes from electronic health records (EHRs) can be challenging and time-consuming. We developed PheMap, a high-throughput phenotyping approach that leverages multiple independent, online resources to streamline the phenotyping process within EHRs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: PheMap is a knowledge base of medical concepts with quantified relationships to phenotypes that have been extracted by natural language processing from publicly available resources. PheMap searches EHRs for each phenotype's quantified concepts and uses them to calculate an individual's probability of having this phenotype. We compared PheMap to clinician-validated phenotyping algorithms from the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), dementia, and hypothyroidism using 84 821 individuals from Vanderbilt Univeresity Medical Center's BioVU DNA Biobank. We implemented PheMap-based phenotypes for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for T2DM, dementia, and hypothyroidism, and phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) for variants in FTO, HLA-DRB1, and TCF7L2. RESULTS: In this initial iteration, the PheMap knowledge base contains quantified concepts for 841 disease phenotypes. For T2DM, dementia, and hypothyroidism, the accuracy of the PheMap phenotypes were >97% using a 50% threshold and eMERGE case-control status as a reference standard. In the GWAS analyses, PheMap-derived phenotype probabilities replicated 43 of 51 previously reported disease-associated variants for the 3 phenotypes. For 9 of the 11 top associations, PheMap provided an equivalent or more significant P value than eMERGE-based phenotypes. The PheMap-based PheWAS showed comparable or better performance to a traditional phecode-based PheWAS. PheMap is publicly available online. CONCLUSIONS: PheMap significantly streamlines the process of extracting research-quality phenotype information from EHRs, with comparable or better performance to current phenotyping approaches.\n.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "pmid28042767": {"__data__": {"id_": "pmid28042767", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "pmid28042767: Title: Advantages of Structure-Based Drug Design Approaches in Neurological Disorders.\n Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the review is to portray the theoretical concept on neurological disorders from research data.

In Europe, factors associated with readmissions have not yet been extensively investigated. This study aimed to discover factors associated with readmissions in both young and older adult internal medicine patients. Furthermore, we explored the role of healthcare-related adverse events (AEs) in readmissions. METHODS: All patients admitted through the emergency department to the internal medicine department in the last 2 weeks of each month (2011) were included. Information on index admissions and readmissions, defined as an unplanned admission within 30 days after discharge, was obtained from the electronic patient record system. Demographic, clinical, and organizational factors were evaluated for their association with readmissions. RESULTS: Of all patients (n = 940), 17.3 % were readmitted; 16.9 % of the younger (<65 years, n = 485), and 17.8 % of the older patients (>=65 years, n = 455). Dependency in activities of daily living (ADL) was the only factor associated with readmissions in both all ages (OR 2.43) and in older patients (OR 3.19), while age was associated with readmissions in younger patients (OR 1.03 per year). AEs leading to 35.4 % of all index admissions were not associated with readmissions. CONCLUSIONS: Readmissions are common in medical patients, and, thus, remain a reason for concern in terms of patient safety and quality of care. AEs, responsible for to the index admission, were not associated with readmissions. ADL dependency was the only factor associated with readmission in patients of all ages and older patients, indicating that determining which patients are at risk for readmissions is not easy.\n.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cancer": {"__data__": {"id_": "cancer", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "cancer", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "haloperidol": {"__data__": {"id_": "haloperidol", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "haloperidol", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "delirium": {"__data__": {"id_": "delirium", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "delirium", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "mental disorder": {"__data__": {"id_": "mental disorder", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "mental disorder", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "death": {"__data__": {"id_": "death", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "death", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "pmid17443600": {"__data__": {"id_": "pmid17443600", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "pmid17443600: Title: Interventions for preventing delirium in hospitalised patients.\n Abstract: BACKGROUND: Delirium is a common mental disorder with serious adverse outcomes in hospitalised patients. It is associated with increases in mortality, physical morbidity, length of hospital stay, institutionalisation and costs to healthcare providers. A range of risk factors has been implicated in its aetiology, including aspects of the routine care and environment in hospitals. Prevention of delirium is clearly desirable from patients' and carers' perspectives, and to reduce hospital costs. Yet it is currently unclear whether interventions for prevention of delirium are effective, whether they can be successfully delivered in all environments, and whether different interventions are necessary for different groups of patients. OBJECTIVES: Our primary objective was to determine the effectiveness of interventions designed to prevent delirium in hospitalised patients. We also aimed to highlight the quality and quantity of research evidence to prevent delirium in these settings. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group on 28th September, 2005. As the searches in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and PsycINFO for the Specialized Register would not necessarily have picked up all delirium prevention trials, these databases were searched again on 28th October, 2005. We also examined reference lists of retrieved articles, reviews and books. Experts in this field were contacted and the Internet searched for further references and to locate unpublished trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials evaluating any interventions to prevent delirium in hospitalised patients. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data collection and quality assessment were performed by three reviewers independently and agreement reached by consensus. MAIN RESULTS: Six studies with a total of 833 participants were identified for inclusion. All were conducted in surgical settings, five in orthopaedic surgery and one in patients undergoing resection for gastric or colon cancer. Only one study of 126 hip fracture patients comparing proactive geriatric consultation with usual care was sufficiently powered to detect a difference in the primary outcome, incident delirium. Total cumulative delirium incidence during admission was reduced in the intervention group (OR 0.48 [95% CI 0.23, 0.98]; RR 0.64 [95% CI 0.37, 0.98]), suggesting a 'number needed to treat' of 5.6 patients to prevent one case. The intervention was particularly effective in preventing severe delirium. In logistic regression analyses adjusting for pre fracture dementia and Activities of Daily Living impairment, there was no reduction in effect size, OR 0.6, but this no longer remained significant [95% CI 0.3,1.3]. There was no effect on the duration of delirium episodes, length of hospital stay, and cognitive status or institutionalisation at discharge. There was also no significant difference in cumulative delirium incidence between treatment and control groups in a sub-group of 50 patients with dementia (RR 0.9 [95% CI 0.59, 1.36]). In another trial of low dose haloperidol prophylaxis, there was no difference in delirium incidence but the severity and duration of a delirium episode, and length of hospital stay were all reduced. We identified no completed studies in hospitalised medical, care of the elderly, general surgery, cancer or intensive care patients. In outcomes, no studies examined for death, use of psychotropic medication, activities of daily living, psychological morbidity, quality of life, carers or staff psychological morbidity, cost of intervention and cost to health care services. Outcomes were only reported up to discharge, with no studies reporting medium or longer-term effects. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Research evidence on effectiveness of interventions to prevent delirium is sparse. Based on a single study, a programme of proactive geriatric consultation may reduce delirium incidence and severity in patients undergoing surgery for hip fracture. Prophylactic low dose haloperidol may reduce severity and duration of delirium episodes and shorten length of hospital admission in hip surgery. Further studies of delirium prevention are needed.\n.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "hip fracture": {"__data__": {"id_": "hip fracture", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "hip fracture", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fractures": {"__data__": {"id_": "fractures", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "fractures", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "mortality": {"__data__": {"id_": "mortality", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "mortality", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "pmid30204859": {"__data__": {"id_": "pmid30204859", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "pmid30204859: Title: Efficacy of Nutritional Intervention in Elderly After Hip Fracture: A Multicenter Randomized Controlled Trial.\n Abstract: Background: Malnutrition after hip fracture is associated with increased rehabilitation time, complications, and mortality. We assessed the effect of intensive 3 month nutritional intervention in elderly after hip fracture on length of stay (LOS). Methods: Open-label, randomized controlled trial. Exclusion criteria: age < 55 years, bone disease, life expectancy < 1 year, bedridden, using oral nutritional supplements (ONS) before hospitalization, and cognitive impairment. Intervention: weekly dietetic consultation, energy-protein-enriched diet, and ONS (400 mL per day) for 3 months. Control: usual nutritional care. Primary outcome: total LOS in hospital and rehabilitation clinic, including readmissions over 6 months (Cox regression adjusted for confounders); hazard ratio (HR) < 1.0 reflects longer LOS in the intervention group. Secondary outcomes: nutritional and functional status, cognition, quality of life, postoperative complications (6 months); subsequent fractures and all-cause mortality (1 and 5 years). Effect modification by baseline nutritional status was also tested. Results: One hundred fifty-two patients were randomized (73 intervention, 79 control). Median total LOS was 34.0 days (range 4-185 days) in the intervention group versus control 35.5 days (3-183 days; plogrank = .80; adjusted hazard ratio (adjHR): 0.98; 95% CI: 0.68-1.41). Hospital LOS: 12.0 days (4-56 days) versus 11.0 days (3-115 days; p = .19; adjHR: 0.75; 95% CI: 0.53-1.06) and LOS in rehabilitation clinics: 19.5 days (0-174 days) versus 18.5 days (0-168 days; p = .82; adjHR: 1.04; 95% CI: 0.73-1.48). The intervention improved nutritional intake/status at 3, but not at 6 months, and did not affect any other outcome.

However, sedation for intractable distress has raised considerable medical and ethical concerns. In our study we provide a critical analysis of seven years experience with the application of sedation in the final phase of life in our palliative care unit. METHODS: Medical records of 548 patients, who died in the Palliative Care Unit of GK Havelhoehe between 1995-2002, were retrospectively analysed with regard to sedation in the last 48 hrs of life. The parameters of investigation included indication, choice and kind of sedation, prevalence of intolerable symptoms, patients' requests for sedation, state of consciousness and communication abilities during sedation. Critical evaluation included a comparison of the period between 1995-1999 and 2000-2002. RESULTS: 14.6% (n = 80) of the patients in palliative care had sedation given by the intravenous route in the last 48 hrs of their life according to internal guidelines. The annual frequency to apply sedation increased continuously from 7% in 1995 to 19% in 2002. Main indications shifted from refractory control of physical symptoms (dyspnoea, gastrointestinal, pain, bleeding and agitated delirium) to more psychological distress (panic-stricken fear, severe depression, refractory insomnia and other forms of affective decompensation). Patients' and relatives' requests for sedation in the final phase were significantly more frequent during the period 2000-2002. CONCLUSION: Sedation in the terminal or final phase of life plays an increasing role in the management of intractable physical and psychological distress. Ethical concerns are raised by patients' requests and needs on the one hand, and the physicians' self-understanding on the other hand. Hence, ethically acceptable criteria and guidelines for the decision making are needed with special regard to the nature of refractory and intolerable symptoms, patients' informed consent and personal needs, the goals and aims of medical sedation in end-of-life care.\n.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bleeding": {"__data__": {"id_": "bleeding", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "bleeding", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "hypotension": {"__data__": {"id_": "hypotension", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "hypotension", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cerebral hypoperfusion": {"__data__": {"id_": "cerebral hypoperfusion", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "cerebral hypoperfusion", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "postoperative delirium": {"__data__": {"id_": "postoperative delirium", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "postoperative delirium", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "intracranial hypertension": {"__data__": {"id_": "intracranial hypertension", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "intracranial hypertension", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "pmid24749254": {"__data__": {"id_": "pmid24749254", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "pmid24749254: Title: [Effect of anaesthesia on incidence of postoperative delirium after major abdominal surgery in elderly patients].\n Abstract: Delirium can be caused by haemodynamics abnormalities during anaesthesia. The main role in delirium appearance is given to decreasing of cerebral perfusion pressure. Especially it can happen in patients with underlying intracranial hypertension. Anaesthetics effects on intracranial pressure are different therefore cerebral hypoperfusion can happens in these patients even without systemic hypotension. Purpose of the study was to define an effect of cerebral perfusion pressure decreasing during different technics of anaesthesia on frequency of delirium in elderly patients after major abdominal surgery. The article deals with results of study of 182 patients (medium age 69 y.o.) underwent elective major abdominal surgery. Delirium frequency was 11%, continuing of delirium was 3 days. The frequency of delirium was higher in patients who had got anaesthesia based on sevoflurane. Additionally these patients had higher frequency of cerebral perfusion pressure decreasing.

We investigated the associated risk factors and consequences. METHODS: We selected constrictive pericarditis patients undergoing isolated pericardiectomy from January 2013 to January 2021. Postoperative low cardiac output was defined as requiring mechanical circulatory support or more than one inotrope to maintain a cardiac index > 2.2 L  min-1  m-2 without hypoperfusion, despite adequate filling status. Uni- and multivariable analysis were used to identify factors associated with low cardiac output. Cox regression was used to identify factors associated with length of hospital stay. RESULTS: Among 212 patients with complete data, 55 (25.9%) developed low cardiac output within postoperative day 1 (quartiles 1 and 2), which caused seven of the nine perioperative deaths. The rates of atrial arrhythmia, renal dysfunction, hypoalbuminemia, modest-to-severe hyponatremia, and hyperbilirubinemia caused by constrictive pericarditis were 9.4%, 12.3%, 49.1%, 10.4%, and 81.6%. The mean preoperative central venous pressure and cardiac index were 18 +- 5 cmH2O and 1.87 +- 0.45 L min-1 m-2. Univariable analysis showed that low cardiac output patients had higher rates of atrial arrhythmia (OR 3.32 [1.35, 8.17], P = 0.007), renal dysfunction (OR 4.24 [1.94, 9.25], P < 0.001), hypoalbuminemia (OR 1.99 [1.06, 3.73], P = 0.031) and hyponatremia (OR 6.36 [2.50, 16.20], P < 0.001), greater E peak velocity variation (difference 2.8 [0.7, 5.0], P = 0.011), higher central venous pressure (difference 3 [2,5] cmH2O, P < 0.001) and lower cardiac index (difference - 0.27 [- 0.41, - 0.14] L min-1 m-2, P < 0.001) than patients without low cardiac output. Multivariable regression showed that atrial arrhythmia (OR 4.04 [1.36, 12.02], P = 0.012), renal dysfunction (OR 2.64 [1.07, 6.50], P = 0.035), hyponatremia (OR 3.49 [1.19, 10.24], P = 0.023), high central venous pressure (OR 1.17 [1.08, 1.27], P < 0.001), and low cardiac index (OR 0.36 [0.14, 0.92], P = 0.032) were associated with low cardiac output (AUC 0.79 [0.72-0.86], P < 0.001). Cox regression analysis showed that hyperbilirubinemia (HR 0.66 [0.46, 0.94], P = 0.022), renal dysfunction (HR 0.51 [0.33, 0.77], P = 0.002), and low cardiac output (HR 0.42 [0.29, 0.59], P < 0.001) were associated with length of hospital stay.

hypernatraemia (ICU-AH) is a serious complication of critical illness. However, there is no detailed information on how this condition develops. Objectives: The objective of this study was to study the prevalence, risk factors, trajectory, management, and outcome of severe ICU-AH (>=155 mmol L-1). Methods: A retrospective study was conducted in a 40-bed ICU in a university-affiliated hospital. Assessment of sodium levels, factors associated with severe ICU-AH, urinary electrolyte measurements, water therapy, fluid balance, correction rate, and delirium was made. Results: We screened 11,642 ICU admissions and identified 109 patients with severe ICU-AH. The median age was 57 years, 63% were male, and the median Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation III score was 64 (52; 80). On the day of ICU admission, 64% of patients were ventilated; 71% received vasopressors, and 22% had acute kidney injury. The median peak sodium level was 158 (156; 161) mmolL-1 at a median of 4 (1; 11) days after ICU admission. Only eight patients (7%) had urine sodium measurement (median concentration: 17 mmol L-1). On the day of peak hypernatraemia, 80% of patients were unable to drink due to invasive ventilation; 34% were on diuretics; 25% had fever, and 50% did not receive hypotonic fluids. When available, the median electrolyte-free water clearance was -1.1 L (-1.7; -0.5), representing half of the urine output.

Data in the literature pertaining to the very elderly remains scarce. OBJECTIVES: This study was conducted to evaluate whether older patients require lower opioid doses than their younger counterparts after undergoing an elective or urgent orthopaedic procedure, and to assess the cumulative incidence of adverse events and length of stay for each age group. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed to compare the mean opioid use and pain control between two groups of elderly patients (65-79 years and >= 80 years of age). The study included 250 patients who underwent either an elective arthroplasty or urgent orthopaedic surgery following a fracture. Data were collected during the 7 days following surgery. RESULTS: No significant difference was found in mean and maximal pain scores between the two groups. Opioid use (expressed in intravenous morphine equivalents) was higher in the younger group. The difference reached statistical significance on the first postoperative day (subjects 65-79 years of age taking 21.3 mg, vs. 10.9 mg for the group over 80 years of age; mean difference 10.3 mg, 95% confidence interval 1.3-19.4). This was also observed in patients undergoing elective surgery on postoperative days 1, 5, 6 and 7. No difference in opioid use was observed between age groups in patients undergoing urgent surgery. Acute cognitive status deterioration, delirium, oxygen desaturation and constipation were observed more frequently in the older group, while mean length of stay was higher in the older group undergoing urgent surgery (8 vs. 17 days, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings further support age-related differences in opioid requirements during the postoperative context after elective orthopaedic surgery, while no difference was found between age groups after urgent surgery.\n.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "pain": {"__data__": {"id_": "pain", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "pain", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "postoperative pain": {"__data__": {"id_": "postoperative pain", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "postoperative pain", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "pmid16184559": {"__data__": {"id_": "pmid16184559", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "pmid16184559: Title: Transmission of rabies virus from an organ donor to four transplant recipients.\n Abstract: BACKGROUND: In 2004, four recipients of kidneys, a liver, and an arterial segment from a common organ donor died of encephalitis of an unknown cause. METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of the organ donor and the recipients. Blood, cerebrospinal fluid, and tissues from the recipients were tested with a variety of assays and pathological stains for numerous causes of encephalitis. Samples from the recipients were also inoculated into mice. RESULTS: The organ donor had been healthy before having a subarachnoid hemorrhage that led to his death. Encephalitis developed in all four recipients within 30 days after transplantation and was accompanied by rapid neurologic deterioration characterized by agitated delirium, seizures, respiratory failure, and coma. They died an average of 13 days after the onset of neurologic symptoms. Mice inoculated with samples from the affected patients became ill seven to eight days later, and electron microscopy of central nervous system (CNS) tissue demonstrated rhabdovirus particles. Rabies-specific immunohistochemical and direct fluorescence antibody staining demonstrated rabies virus in multiple tissues from all recipients. Cytoplasmic inclusions consistent with Negri bodies were seen in CNS tissue from all recipients. Antibodies against rabies virus were present in three of the four recipients and the donor. The donor had told others of being bitten by a bat.

However, axillary artery cannulation has not been established as a routine procedure because there is controversy about its clinical advantage. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We examined 111 patients diagnosed with acute type A aortic dissection between January 2000 and December 2009. The right axillary artery was cannulated in 58 patients (group A) and the femoral artery was cannulated in 53 (group F). The postoperative outcomes were retrospectively reviewed and compared between the two groups. RESULTS: There were 46 male and 65 female patients with a mean age of 58.9+-13.1 years (range, 26 to 84 years). The extent of aortic replacement in both groups did not differ. There were 8 early deaths (7.2%) and 2 late deaths (1.8%). The mean follow-up duration was 46.0+-32.6 months (range, 1 month to 10 years). Transient neurologic dysfunction was observed in 11 patients (19.0%) in group A and 14 patients (26.4%) in group F. A total of 11 patients (9.9%) suffered from a permanent neurologic dysfunction. Early and delayed stroke were observed in 6 patients (10.3%) and 2 patients (3.4%), respectively, in group A as well as 2 patients (3.8%) and 1 patient (1.9%), respectively, in group F. There were no statistical differences in the cannulation-related complications between both groups (3 in group A vs. 0 in group F). CONCLUSION: There were no differences in postoperative neurologic outcomes and cannulation-related complications according to the cannulation sites. The cannulation site in an aortic dissection should be carefully chosen on a case-by-case basis. It is important to also pay attention to the possibility of intraoperative malperfusion syndrome occurring and the subsequent need to change the cannulation site.\n.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cerebral embolization": {"__data__": {"id_": "cerebral embolization", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "cerebral embolization", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "neurologic dysfunction": {"__data__": {"id_": "neurologic dysfunction", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "neurologic dysfunction", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "aortic dissection": {"__data__": {"id_": "aortic dissection", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "aortic dissection", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "pmid34670594": {"__data__": {"id_": "pmid34670594", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "pmid34670594: Title: Antimicrobial stewardship measures in cardiac surgery and its impact on surgical site infections.\n Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to monitor the compliance and impact on a protocol change of surgical antimicrobial prophylaxis in cardiac surgery favouring cefazolin instead cefuroxime, initiated by the hospital's antimicrobial stewardship team. METHODS: This quality improvement study was performed in a tertiary care hospital in collaboration with the department of cardiothoracic surgery and the hospitals antimicrobial stewardship team following a revision of the standard for surgical antimicrobial prophylaxis including 1029 patients who underwent cardiac surgery. 582 patients receiving cefuroxime and 447 patients receiving cefazolin respectively were compared without altering any other preventative perioperative measures including its postoperative duration of less than 24 h. Adherence and surgical site infections were compiled and analysed. RESULTS: A complete adherence was achieved. Overall surgical site infections occurred in 37 (3.6%) of the cases, 20 (3.4%) in cefuroxime patients and 17 (3.8%) in cefazolin patients (p value = 0.754). No statistically significant differences could be found in any of the primary endpoints, but there was a trend towards less deep sternal wound infections in the cefazolin group.

"pmid27245661: Title: Activated brain mast cells contribute to postoperative cognitive dysfunction by evoking microglia activation and neuronal apoptosis.\n Abstract: BACKGROUND: Neuroinflammation plays a key role in the occurrence and development of postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD). Microglia, the resident immune cells in the brain, has been increasingly recognized to contribute to neuroinflammation. Although brain mast cells (MCs) are the \"first responder\" in the brain injury rather than microglia, little is known about the functional aspects of MCs-microglia interactions. METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were injected intracerebroventricular with MC stabilizer Cromolyn (100 mug/mul), MC stimulator C48/80 (1 mug/mul), or sterile saline 30 min before open tibial fracture surgery, and the levels of neuroinflammation and memory dysfunction were tested 1 and 3 days after surgery. In addition, the effect of activated MCs on microglia and neurons was determined in vitro. RESULTS: Tibial fracture surgery induced MCs degranulation, microglia activation, and inflammatory factors production, which initiated the acute brain inflammatory response and neuronal death and exhibited cognitive deficit. Site-directed preinjection of the \"MCs stabilizer\" disodium cromoglycate (Cromolyn) inhibited this effect, including decrease of inflammatory cytokines, reduced MCs degranulation, microglia activation, neuronal death, and improved cognitive function 24 h after the surgery. In vitro study, we found that the conditioned medium from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated mast cells line (P815) could induce primary microglia activation through mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway signaling and subsequent production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). In addition, the activated P815 could directly induce neuronal apoptosis and synapse injury with microglia independently. Cromolyn could inhibit P815 activation following improved microglia activation and neuronal loss. CONCLUSIONS: These results implicate that activated MCs could trigger microglia activation and neuronal damage, resulting in central nervous system (CNS) inflammation, and communications of MCs with microglia and neuron could constitute a new and unique therapeutic target for CNS immune inflammation-related diseases.\n.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "postoperative cognitive dysfunction": {"__data__": {"id_": "postoperative cognitive dysfunction", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "postoperative cognitive dysfunction", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "synapse injury": {"__data__": {"id_": "synapse injury", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "synapse injury", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "il 6": {"__data__": {"id_": "il 6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "il 6", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "disodium cromoglycate": {"__data__": {"id_": "disodium cromoglycate", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "disodium cromoglycate", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "neuronal apoptosis": {"__data__": {"id_": "neuronal apoptosis", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "neuronal apoptosis", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "monoamines": {"__data__": {"id_": "monoamines", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "monoamines", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "monoamine oxidase a": {"__data__": {"id_": "monoamine oxidase a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "monoamine oxidase a", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "tumor": {"__data__": {"id_": "tumor", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "tumor", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "pmid38349393": {"__data__": {"id_": "pmid38349393", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "pmid38349393: Title: Targeting monoamine oxidase A: a strategy for inhibiting tumor growth with both immune checkpoint inhibitors and immune modulators.\n Abstract: Monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) is a membrane-bound mitochondrial enzyme present in almost all vertebrate tissues that catalyzes the degradation of biogenic and dietary-derived monoamines. MAOA is known for regulating neurotransmitter metabolism and has been implicated in antitumor immune responses. In this review, we retrospect that MAOA inhibits the activities of various types of tumor-associated immune cells (such as CD8+ T cells and tumor-associated macrophages) by regulating their intracellular monoamines and metabolites. Developing novel MAOA inhibitor drugs and exploring multidrug combination strategies may enhance the efficacy of immune governance. Thus, MAOA may act as a novel immune checkpoint or immunomodulator by influencing the efficacy and effectiveness of immunotherapy. In conclusion, MAOA is a promising immune target that merits further in-depth exploration in preclinical and clinical settings.\n.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ps": {"__data__": {"id_": "ps", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "ps", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ketamin": {"__data__": {"id_": "ketamin", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "ketamin", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "lorazepam": {"__data__": {"id_": "lorazepam", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "lorazepam", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "pmid29534713": {"__data__": {"id_": "pmid29534713", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "pmid29534713: Title: Palliative sedation in Germany: factors and treatment practices associated with different sedation rate estimates in palliative and hospice care services.\n Abstract: BACKGROUND: Clinical practice of Palliative Sedation (PS) varies between institutions worldwide and sometimes includes problematic practices. Little available research points at different definitions and frameworks which may contribute to uncertainty of healthcare professionals in the application of PS. This analysis investigates what demographic factors and characteristics of treatment practices differ between institutions with high versus low sedation rates estimates in Palliative and Hospice Care in Germany. METHODS: Data sets from 221 organisations from a prior online survey were separated into two sub-groups divided by their estimated sedation rate A) lower/equal to 16% (n = 187; 90.8%) and B) higher than 16% (n = 19; 9.2%) for secondary analysis. Demographic factors and characteristics of PS treatment practices between the two groups were compared using T-Tests and Chi2/ Fisher Exact Tests and considered significant (*) at two-sided p < .05. RESULTS: Organisations in group B report that they discuss PS for a higher proportion of patients (38.5%/10.2%, p < 0.000**), rate agitation more often as an indications for PS (78.9%/ 53.5%, p = 0.050*), and are more likely to use Lorazepam (63.2%/ 37.4%, p = 0.047*), Promethazin (26.3%/ 9.6%, p = 0.044*), and (Es-)Ketamin (31.6%/ 12.8%, p = 0.039*) than representatives in group A. Both groups differ significantly in their allocation of three case scenarios to different types of PS. CONCLUSIONS: Both definitions and patterns of clinical practice between palliative and hospice care representatives show divergence, which may be influenced one by another. A comprehensive framework considering conceptual, clinical, ethical, and legal aspects of different definitions of PS could help to better distinguish between different types and nuances of PS.\n.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "agitation": {"__data__": {"id_": "agitation", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "agitation", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "pulmonary embolism": {"__data__": {"id_": "pulmonary embolism", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "pulmonary embolism", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "urinary tract infection": {"__data__": {"id_": "urinary tract infection", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "urinary tract infection", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "respiratory complications": {"__data__": {"id_": "respiratory complications", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "respiratory complications", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "pmid30095800": {"__data__": {"id_": "pmid30095800", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "pmid30095800: Title: Can Elective Spine Surgery Be Performed Safely Among Nonagenarians?: Analysis of a National Inpatient Database in Japan.\n Abstract: STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. OBJECTIVE: To compare morbidity and mortality between nonagenarians and other older adult patients who underwent elective spine surgery. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: There is a lack of information of the perioperative risks of nonagenarians undergoing spine surgery. METHODS: Data of patients aged >=65 years who underwent elective spine surgery from July 2010 to March 2013 were extracted from the Diagnosis Procedure Combination database, a nationwide administrative inpatient database in Japan. Clinical outcomes included mortality, occurrence of major complications (cardiac events, respiratory complications, pulmonary embolism, stroke, and acute renal failure), urinary tract infection, and postoperative delirium. These clinical outcomes in nonagenarians were compared with those in patients aged 65 to 79 years and octogenarians. A multivariate logistic regression model fitted with a generalized estimation equation was used to evaluate the influence of advanced age on 90-day mortality and postoperative major complications. RESULTS: Of 88,370 patients identified in the database, 418 were nonagenarians. Compared with patients aged 65 to 79 years and octogenarians, nonagenarians had the highest rates of 90-day mortality (0.2%, 0.3%, and 1.7%, respectively; P < 0.001) and at least one major complication (3.7%, 5.0%, and 7.4%, respectively; P < 0.001). Nonagenarians had the highest proportions of cardiac events, respiratory complications, urinary tract infections, and delirium. The multivariable logistic regression analyses revealed that nonagenarians had increased risks of both 90-day mortality (odds ratio, 8.65; 95% confidence interval, 3.62-20.6) and postoperative major complications (odds ratio, 2.32; 95% confidence interval, 1.61-3.36) compared with patients aged 65 to 79 years. CONCLUSION: Nonagenarians had increased morbidity and mortality following elective spine surgery compared with other older adult patients. Among the complications, cardiac events, respiratory complications, urinary tract infection, and delirium were more likely to occur in nonagenarians.

We investigated the association between kidney function and cognitive impairment severity in oldest-old people with a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: A cross-sectional study of patients aged 80 years and older was conducted at a veterans' home in Taiwan between 2012 and 2016. Their estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was determined using the Modification of Diet in Renal Diseases (MDRD) equation. Cognitive function was evaluated with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR). RESULTS: A total of 84 patients (age mean +- SD, 86.6 +- 3.9 years) had MMSE scores of 10.1 +- 6.7, and CDR scores of 1.6 +- 0.7. The average eGFR was 61.7 +- 21.5 mL/min/1.73m2. The mean hemoglobin concentration was 12.7 +- 1.7 g/dl, and the mean albumin concentration was 4.5 +- 4.8 g/dl. Multivariate regression analyses showed that scores of CDR were significantly correlated with eGFR after adjustment for potential confounders. The scores of MMSE were significantly correlated with serum albumin and hemoglobin after adjustment for potential confounders. CONCLUSIONS: We found dementia severity was significantly associated with kidney function, serum albumin, and hemoglobin in the oldest-old with AD. We recommend that oldest-old people with a diagnosis of AD be evaluated to determine kidney function, as well as nutritional and hematological status. Further study is needed to establish whether prevention of CKD deterioration, and correction of malnutrition and anemia may help to slow cognitive decline in oldest-old people with dementia.\n.",

Abstract: As patients with critical respiratory diseases suffer from the discomfort of disease, frequent medical and nursing procedures, and the noise disturbance of the ICU environment, it is necessary to implement analgesia and sedation to reduce their negative stress and oxygen consumption. Special emphasis will be placed on the clinical practice of analgesia, sedation and rehabilitation in critically ill patients with respiratory diseases, as different pathophysiological features of the respective pulmonary diseases are presented, such as severe asthma and acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, as well as the exclusive situations during respiratory therapy, such as recruitment maneuvers, bedside bronchoscopy and operation of extracorporeal membrane oxygenators. To standardize the prevention and management of pain, agitation, delirium, immobility, and sleep disturbance in adult patients with critical respiratory diseases, the Chinese Thoracic Society and Critical Care Medicine Group of Chinese Association of Chest Physicians, Chinese Medical Doctor Association organized pulmonary and critical care experts to discuss 19 important issues and ultimately provided 20 recommendations based on the best available evidence.Assessment, prevention and management of pain should be prioritized before the administration of continuous infused sedatives in all patients with critical respiratory diseases. Bundles that include multiple strategies of non-pharmacological interventions to prevent and manage delirium and sleep disruption are encouraged. For the patients with stable respiratory and hemodynamic status, early mobility and exercise could be safe and beneficial. Respiratory drive control by addressing patient and ventilator factors should be the priority before administration of analog-sedation protocol in the ARDS patients. Deep sedation could be necessary in the early stage of ARDS with high respiratory drive, and during the recruitment maneuver, prone position and measurement of the respiratory mechanics. Maintaining spontaneous breathing with a lower level of sedation is recommended in COPD patients on invasive mechanical ventilation, while a deeper level of sedation, even with a short course of neuromuscular blockade, may be beneficial among severe asthma patients with high peak airway pressure. Pharmacokinetic alterations in patients with critical respiratory diseases during ECMO support are complicated as varied factors are involved, including ECMO circuit factors, drug factors, and patient factors. Therefore, the dosage of analgesics and sedatives should be adjusted according to the target of analog-sedation protocol in the respective disease.\n.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "neuromuscular blockade": {"__data__": {"id_": "neuromuscular blockade", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "neuromuscular blockade", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "chronic obstructive pulmonary disease": {"__data__": {"id_": "chronic obstructive pulmonary disease", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "chronic obstructive pulmonary disease", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "sleep disruption": {"__data__": {"id_": "sleep disruption", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "sleep disruption", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "clozapine": {"__data__": {"id_": "clozapine", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "clozapine", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "pmid26467781": {"__data__": {"id_": "pmid26467781", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "pmid26467781: Title: Functional mental capacity, treatment as usual and time: magnitude of change in secure hospital patients with major mental illness.\n Abstract: BACKGROUND: Decision making ability can change with time, depending on mental or physical health. Little is known about the factors that determine this change and the relationship of capacity to time. As a pilot for studies using functional mental capacities as an outcome measure, we sought to quantify this relationship measuring change over time using competence assessment tools, and rating scales for symptoms and global function. METHODOLOGY: We assessed 37 inpatients in a secure psychiatric hospital. All patients met the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders-fourth edition and International classification of diseases, 10th edition criteria for an Axis 1 mental illness, all with psychosis. Patients were interviewed twice a mean of 323 days apart (median 176 days range 17-1221 days). The MacArthur competence assessment tools for consent to treatment (MacCAT-T) and fitness to plead (MacCAT-FP) were used to quantify functional capacity along with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and global assessment of function (GAF) scale. A comparison was also made between those patients prescribed clozapine in comparison to other antipsychotics. RESULTS: The number judged by treating psychiatrists to lack capacity either to make a treatment choice or to plead in court fell from 35 to 8%. Change was greatest for those admitted within the previous 9 months. The measures of capacity improved between time 1 and time 2 for both consent to treatment and fitness to plead. The measures of capacity improved with positive symptoms within the PANSS and with GAF scores. Those with shorter lengths of stay at baseline had the greatest improvements in the MacCAT-FP scores. Effect sizes were medium or large (0.3-0.7+). As expected, patients prescribed clozapine had larger changes in functional mental capacities and larger effect sizes than those prescribed other psychotropics. The results show a strong relationship between the clinicians' assessment of capacity and structured rating scales. CONCLUSIONS: We have shown that there is an improvement in capacity scores with time. More research is needed to compare the effect of treatment on capacity at fixed time intervals. It would also be helpful to look at a more general patient population.\n.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "psychosis": {"__data__": {"id_": "psychosis", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "psychosis", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "pmid20920220": {"__data__": {"id_": "pmid20920220", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "pmid20920220: Title: An interdisciplinary intervention for older Taiwanese patients after surgery for hip fracture improves health-related quality of life.\n Abstract: BACKGROUND: The effects of intervention programs on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of patients with hip fracture have not been well studied. We hypothesized that older patients with hip fracture who received our interdisciplinary intervention program would have better HRQOL than those who did not. METHODS: A randomized experimental design was used. Older patients with hip fracture (N = 162), 60 to 98 years old, from a medical center in northern Taiwan were randomly assigned to an experimental (n = 80) or control (n = 82) group. HRQOL was measured by the SF-36 Taiwan version at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after discharge. RESULTS: The experimental group had significantly better overall outcomes in bodily pain (beta = 9.38, p = 0.002), vitality (beta = 9.40, p < 0.001), mental health (beta = 8.16, p = 0.004), physical function (beta = 16.01, p < 0.001), and role physical (beta = 22.66, p < 0.001) than the control group at any time point during the first year after discharge. Physical-related health outcomes (physical functioning, role physical, and vitality) had larger treatment effects than emotional/mental- and social functioning-related health outcomes.

This study investigates the regulatory network of exosomal non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), including miRNAs, circRNAs, and lncRNAs, in ferroptosis modulation. The primary goal is to examine the pathological roles of ferroptosis-related exosomal ncRNAs, particularly in ischemic reperfusion injuries. The research reveals intricate molecular interactions governing the regulatory interplay between exosomal ncRNAs and ferroptosis, elucidating their diverse roles in different non-malignant pathological contexts. Attention is given to their impact on diseases, including cardiac, cerebral, liver, and kidney ischemic injuries, as well as lung, wound, and neuronal injuries. Beyond theoretical exploration, the study provides insights into potential therapeutic applications, emphasizing the significance of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)-derived exosomes. Findings underscore the pivotal role of MSC-derived exosomal ncRNAs in modulating cellular responses related to ferroptosis regulation, introducing a cutting-edge dimension. This recognition emphasizes the importance of MSC-derived exosomes as crucial mediators with broad therapeutic implications.

Treatment with one or more psychotropic drug is often without explicit clinical indication, despite low treatment efficacy, and potential side effects. We aim to investigate the multi-psychotropic drug use to identify factors and patient characteristics associated with multi-use. METHODS: We analysed three cohorts from 129 Norwegian nursing homes, collected between 2004 and 2011. Patients (N = 4739) were assessed with the Neuropsychiatric Inventory - Nursing Home version (NPI-NH), Clinical Dementia Rating scale, and Physical Self Maintenance Scale. We used ordinal logistic regression to analyse associations between psychotropics (antidepressants, antipsychotics, anxiolytics, hypnotics, and anti-dementia drugs), patient characteristics, and neuropsychiatric symptoms. RESULTS: Patients used on average 6.6 drugs; 27 % used no psychotropics, 32 % one, and 41 % multiple psychotropic drugs (24 % two, 17 % >=3). Thirty-nine percent were prescribed antidepressants, 30 % sedatives, 24 % anxiolytics, and 20 % antipsychotics. The total NPI-NH score was associated with multi-use (OR 1.02, 95 % CI 1.02-1.03), and increased from a mean of 13.5 (SD 16.3) for patients using none, to 25.5 (21.8) for patients using >=3 psychotropics. Affective symptoms (depression and anxiety) were most strongly associated with multi-psychotropic drug use (OR 1.10, 95 % CI: 1.09-1.12). Female gender, independency in daily living, younger age, dementia, and many regular drugs were also associated with multi-use.

This study aimed to assess whether ventilation strategies, cardiovascular support and sedation in BICU patients have changed over time, and whether this affects outcome. A retrospective observational study comparing two 12-patient BICU cohorts (2005/06 and 2010/11) was undertaken. Demographic and admission characteristics, ventilation parameters, sedation, fluid resuscitation, cardiovascular support and outcome (length of stay, mortality) data were collected from patient notes. Data was analysed using T-tests, Fisher's exact and Mann-Whitney U tests. In our study cohort groups were equivalent in demographic and admission parameters. There were equal ventilator-free days in the two cohorts 10 +- 12.7 vs. 13.3 +- 12.2 ventilator free days; P = 0.447). The 2005/06 cohort were mechanically ventilated more often than in 2010/11 cohort (568 ventilator days/1000 patient BICU days vs. 206 ventilator days/1000 patient BICU days; P = 0.001). The 2005/06 cohort were ventilated less commonly in tracheostomy group/endotracheal tube spontaneous (17.8% vs. 26%; P = 0.001) and volume-controlled modes (34.4% vs. 40.8%; P = 0.001). Patients in 2010/11 cohort were more heavily sedated (P = 0.001) with more long-acting sedative drug use (P = 0.001) than the 2005/06 cohort, fluid administration was equivalent.

Inhalational injury patients were ventilated in volume-controlled (44.5% vs. 28.1%; P = 0.001) and pressure-controlled modes (18.2% vs. 9.5%; P = 0.001) more frequently than those without. Outcome did not vary. This study showed there has been shift away from mechanical ventilation, with increased use of tracheostomy/tracheal tube airway spontaneous ventilation. Inhalation injury patients require more ventilatory support though patient outcomes do not differ.

The kynurenine pathway (KP), which is regulated by the enzymes tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO) and indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase (IDO), which catalyze the conversion of Trp to kynurenine (Kyn), facilitates immune regulation and influences neurocognition. Notably, Kyn metabolites bind the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR), essential for memory encoding, and in turn, cognition.

METHODS: The study was based on a sample of 283 ICU nurses from eight hospitals in Chongqing selected using a convenience sampling method between July 2023 and September 2023. The tools used included a general information questionnaire, the Chinese version of the Delirium Care Self-Efficacy of ICU Nurses Scale, and the Chinese version of the ICU Delirium Knowledge Level Questionnaire. RESULTS: The self-efficacy score (47.84 +- 9.93) of ICU nurses was positively correlated with the delirium knowledge level score (12.32 +- 3.47, r = 0.591, P < 0.001). Multivariate linear regression analysis identified the gender of the nurse, hospital level (tier), duration of ICU work experience, whether the nurse was a specialized ICU nurse, whether the nurse received delirium-related training, and the level of knowledge about delirium (all P < 0.05) as the influencing factors for the delirium care self-efficacy of ICU nurses. CONCLUSION: It is recommended that ICU nursing managers offer targeted interventions based on the influencing factors to improve the delirium care self-efficacy of ICU nurses and their delirium knowledge levels, thereby reducing the incidence of delirium and improving the quality of care provided for patients with delirium in the ICU.\n.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "gait apraxia": {"__data__": {"id_": "gait apraxia", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "gait apraxia", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "unsteadiness": {"__data__": {"id_": "unsteadiness", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "unsteadiness", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "pressure ulcers": {"__data__": {"id_": "pressure ulcers", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "pressure ulcers", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "asphyxiation": {"__data__": {"id_": "asphyxiation", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "asphyxiation", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "incontinence": {"__data__": {"id_": "incontinence", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "incontinence", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cardiac arrest": {"__data__": {"id_": "cardiac arrest", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "cardiac arrest", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "language": {"__data__": {"id_": "language", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "language", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "impaired memory": {"__data__": {"id_": "impaired memory", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "impaired memory", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "pmid16077257": {"__data__": {"id_": "pmid16077257", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "pmid16077257: Title: Restraint free care in older adults with dementia.\n Abstract: During the past two decades, significant research and several government and health care quality groups have advised against the use of physical restraints in hospitals and nursing homes, yet older adults are continuing to die, become injured or experience the iatrogenic complications associated with this practice. Deaths are usually caused by asphyxiation, but also occur from strangulation, or cardiac arrest. Older adults with dementia are at high risk for restraint use because of impaired memory, language, judgment and visual perception. In moderate to severe dementia, the risk of falls is greater because of gait apraxia and unsteadiness. Agitation, disorientation, and pacing behaviors from delirium or dementia can precipitate staff to use restraints to prevent harm to the older adult or to others. Physical restraints should be eliminated as an intervention in older adults with dementia because they are also very likely to cause acute functional decline, incontinence, pressure ulcers and regressive behaviors in a short period of time. The purpose of this paper is to disseminate the dangers of this clinical practice and to summarize the latest research in restraint free care and restraint alternatives in the United States.\n.",

neurocognitive dysfunction (PND) is a prevalent and debilitating complication in elderly surgical patients, characterized by persistent cognitive decline that negatively affects recovery and quality of life. As the aging population grows, the rising number of elderly surgical patients has made PND an urgent clinical challenge. Despite increasing research efforts, the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying PND remain inadequately characterized, underscoring the need for a more integrated framework to guide targeted interventions. To better understand the molecular mechanisms and therapeutic targets of PND, this narrative review synthesized evidence from peer-reviewed studies, identified through comprehensive searches of PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science. Key findings highlight neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, neurotransmitter imbalances, microvascular changes, and white matter lesions as central to PND pathophysiology, with particular parallels to encephalocele- and sepsis-associated cognitive impairments. Among these, neuroinflammation, mediated by pathways such as the NLRP3 inflammasome and blood-brain barrier disruption, emerges as a pivotal driver, triggering cascades that exacerbate neuronal injury. Oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction synergistically amplify these effects, while neurotransmitter imbalances and microvascular alterations, including white matter lesions, contribute to synaptic dysfunction and cognitive decline. Anesthetic agents modulate these interconnected pathways, exhibiting both protective and detrimental effects. Propofol and dexmedetomidine demonstrate neuroprotective properties by suppressing neuroinflammation and microglial activation, whereas inhalational anesthetics like sevoflurane intensify oxidative stress and inflammatory responses. Ketamine, with its anti-inflammatory potential, offers promise but requires further evaluation to determine its long-term safety and efficacy. By bridging molecular insights with clinical practice, this review highlights the critical role of personalized anesthetic strategies in mitigating PND and improving cognitive recovery in elderly surgical patients. It aims to inform future research and clinical decision-making to address this multifaceted challenge.\n.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "white matter lesions": {"__data__": {"id_": "white matter lesions", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "white matter lesions", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "propofol": {"__data__": {"id_": "propofol", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "propofol", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "nlrp3": {"__data__": {"id_": "nlrp3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "nlrp3", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "postoperative neurocognitive dysfunction": {"__data__": {"id_": "postoperative neurocognitive dysfunction", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "postoperative neurocognitive dysfunction", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "non hodgkin lymphomas": {"__data__": {"id_": "non hodgkin lymphomas", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "non hodgkin lymphomas", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "multi organ failure": {"__data__": {"id_": "multi organ failure", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "multi organ failure", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "car t": {"__data__": {"id_": "car t", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "car t", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "pmid32839196": {"__data__": {"id_": "pmid32839196", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "pmid32839196: Title: How I treat adverse effects of CAR-T cell therapy.\n Abstract: Chimeric antigenreceptor (CAR) T cell therapy has demonstrated efficacy in B cell malignancies, particularly for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and non-Hodgkin lymphomas.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is prevalent in surgical patients, and has been suggested to be a risk factor for postoperative delirium and pain. OSA also might impact pain perception, and alter pain medication requirements. This protocol describes an observational study, with the primary aim of testing whether OSA is an independent predictor of postoperative complications, focusing on (i) postoperative incident delirium and (ii) acute postoperative pain severity. We secondarily hypothesize that compliance with prescribed treatment for OSA (typically continuous positive airway pressure or CPAP) might decrease the risk of delirium and the severity of pain. Methods and analysis: We will include data from patients who have been enrolled into three prospective studies: ENGAGES, PODCAST, and SATISFY-SOS. All participants underwent general anesthesia for a non-neurosurgical inpatient operation, and had a postoperative hospital stay of at least one day at Barnes Jewish Hospital in St. Louis, Missouri, from February 2013 to May 2018.  Patients included in this study have been assessed for postoperative delirium and pain severity as part of the parent studies. In the current study, determination of delirium diagnosis will be based on the Confusion Assessment Method, and the Visual Analogue Pain Scale will be used for pain severity. Data on OSA diagnosis, OSA risk and compliance with treatment will be obtained from the preoperative assessment record.

This study was to investigate whether there would be an association between the four major ABO blood groups and postoperative pain, as indicated by the differences in pain scores and rescue fentanyl requirements among blood groups in children after adenotonsillectomy. METHODS: A total of 124 children, aged 3-7 years, ASA I or II, and undergoing elective adenotonsillectomy were enrolled in the study. Postoperative pain was evaluated using the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Pain Scale (CHEOPS) and the rescue fentanyl requirement in post anesthesia care unit (PACU) was analyzed. Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium (PAED) score and the duration of PACU were recorded. The postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) within 24 h were documented. RESULTS: Among four blood type groups, no significant differences were observed regarding surgery time, and the gaps of fentanyl given at the anesthesia induction and the first rescue fentanyl injection in PACU. However, patients from AB and B blood groups had significantly higher pain score at initial CHEOPS assessment and consequently, higher consumption of rescue fentanyl during PACU stay. A significantly higher percentage of patients had received > 1 mug/kg rescue fentanyl. Higher PAED scores were also observed in AB and B blood groups. CONCLUSION: Paediatric patients with AB and B blood type had higher postoperative CHEOPS pain score and required significantly more fentanyl for pain control than those with A and O blood type after T&A. The initial scores of PAED in patients with AB and B blood type were also higher than that in patients with A and O blood type.\n.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ab": {"__data__": {"id_": "ab", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "ab", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "depressive mood": {"__data__": {"id_": "depressive mood", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "depressive mood", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "pmid22301203": {"__data__": {"id_": "pmid22301203", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "pmid22301203: Title: Low social support is associated with an increased risk of postoperative delirium.\n Abstract: STUDY OBJECTIVE: To examine the predictive value of social support in postoperative delirium.

PATIENTS: 106 consecutive patients undergoing a planned orthopedic surgery with general anesthesia. MEASUREMENTS: All patients completed questionnaires to assess depressive mood (the Beck Depression Inventory) and social support (Sarason's Social Support Questionnaire) during the preanesthesia visit. Postoperative delirium symptoms were assessed daily using the Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale. Demographic, clinical, and biological data, including anesthesia procedure, were recorded. MAIN RESULTS: Controlling for various potential confounders through multivariate binary logistic regression, postoperative delirium was independently predicted by satisfaction with social support, but neither by depressive mood nor the number of supportive persons. Other significant predictors were the preoperative use of benzodiazepines, age, and type of surgery. CONCLUSION: Patients who report low satisfaction with social support may present with a particular vulnerability to postoperative delirium, even after controlling for physical confounding variables and depressive mood.\n.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "benzodiazepines": {"__data__": {"id_": "benzodiazepines", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "benzodiazepines", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "chronic back pain": {"__data__": {"id_": "chronic back pain", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "chronic back pain", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "baclofen": {"__data__": {"id_": "baclofen", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "baclofen", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "midazolam": {"__data__": {"id_": "midazolam", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "midazolam", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "spinal stenosis": {"__data__": {"id_": "spinal stenosis", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "spinal stenosis", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "pmid31930325": {"__data__": {"id_": "pmid31930325", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "pmid31930325: Title: Enteral baclofen withdrawal managed with intravenous dexmedetomidine: A case report.\n Abstract: PURPOSE: Acute enteral baclofen withdrawal can be clinically severe if not identified and managed appropriately. Treatment of baclofen withdrawal includes supportive care and reinitiation of baclofen. There are limited pharmacotherapeutic interventions available to manage symptoms of acute enteral baclofen withdrawal, especially in nonintubated patients. SUMMARY: We describe a 61-year-old Caucasian male with a past medical history of chronic back pain and spinal stenosis who was admitted to the medical intensive care unit with confusion, insomnia, agitation, delirium, and auditory and visual hallucinations. For control of agitation, the patient was administered 10 mg of i.v. haloperidol, 1 mg of i.v. lorazepam, and 14 mg of i.v. midazolam, with minimal improvement noted; therefore, dexmedetomidine was initiated, which led to clinical resolution of his symptoms. Upon further investigation it was determined that the patient was taking approximately 10 baclofen 20-mg tablets a day. According to his pharmacy records, he had filled prescriptions for a total of 738 baclofen tablets in the previous 12 weeks. The patient's presentation and sudden discontinuation of high-dose baclofen led to a diagnosis of baclofen withdrawal. Baclofen was subsequently restarted, and dexmedetomidine was weaned over 36 hours. CONCLUSION: Dexmedetomidine controlled this patient's agitation and delirium without suppressing his respiratory drive and should be considered for management of acute enteral baclofen withdrawal.\n.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "auditory and visual hallucinations": {"__data__": {"id_": "auditory and visual hallucinations", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "auditory and visual hallucinations", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "pmid7145182": {"__data__": {"id_": "pmid7145182", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "pmid7145182: Title: [Hypopotassemia during delirium tremens.

Thus, we derived a novel predicted probability of death model (PDeathDx) upon all diagnostic codes documented in the Department of Veterans Affairs. We present the conceptual underpinnings and analytic approach in estimating the independent contribution of pre-existing conditions. This is the largest study to-date following patients with COVID-19 to predict mortality. Cases were identified with at least one positive nucleic acid amplification test. Starting in 1997, we use diagnoses from the first time a patient sought care until 14 days before a positive nucleic acid amplification test. We demonstrate the clear advantage of using an unrestricted set of pre-existing conditions to model COVID-19 mortality, as models using conventional comorbidity indices often assign little weight or usually do not include some of the highest risk conditions; the same is true of conditions associated with COVID-19 severity. Our findings suggest that it is risky to pick comorbidities for analysis without a systematic review of all those experienced by the cohort. Unlike conventional approaches, our comprehensive methodology provides the flexibility that has been advocated for comorbidity indices since 1993; such an approach can be readily adapted for other diseases and outcomes. With our comorbidity risk adjustment approach outperforming conventional indices for predicting COVID-19 mortality, it shows promise for predicting outcomes for other conditions of interest.\n.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "coronavirus disease 2019": {"__data__": {"id_": "coronavirus disease 2019", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "coronavirus disease 2019", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "abdominal pain": {"__data__": {"id_": "abdominal pain", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "abdominal pain", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "magnesium chloride": {"__data__": {"id_": "magnesium chloride", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "magnesium chloride", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "neurological hyperexcitability": {"__data__": {"id_": "neurological hyperexcitability", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "neurological hyperexcitability", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ischemic": {"__data__": {"id_": "ischemic", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "ischemic", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "renal magnesium wasting": {"__data__": {"id_": "renal magnesium wasting", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "renal magnesium wasting", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "pmid27117800": {"__data__": {"id_": "pmid27117800", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "pmid27117800: Title: Primary renal magnesium wasting: an unusual clinical picture of exercise-induced symptoms.\n Abstract: Magnesium is one of the most abundant cations in the human body and plays a key role as a metabolic enzyme cofactor and regulatory ion for neurons and cardiomyocytes. Hypomagnesemia due to isolated primary renal magnesium wasting is a rare clinical condition typically associated with neurological hyperexcitability. Exercise-related gastrointestinal symptoms are caused by ischemic, mechanical, or neurohormonal changes. The role of hypomagnesemia in gastrointestinal symptoms is not well understood. We present a case of a 15-year-old male who presented with exercise-induced abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, who was found to have profound hypomagnesemia and inappropriately elevated fractional excretion of magnesium (FEMg). Testing for multiple intrinsic and extrinsic etiologies of renal magnesium wasting was inconclusive. He was diagnosed with primary renal magnesium wasting and his symptoms resolved acutely with intravenous magnesium sulfate and with long-term oral magnesium chloride. Primary renal magnesium wasting is a rare clinical entity that can cause extreme hypomagnesemia. It has not been associated previously with exercise-induced gastrointestinal symptoms. The effects of hypomagnesemia on the human gastrointestinal tract are not well established. This case offers unique insights into the importance of magnesium homeostasis in the gastrointestinal tract. Exercise-induced splanchnic hypoperfusion may contribute to gastrointestinal symptoms observed in this chronically hypomagnesemic patient. \n.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null,

coenzyme A binding protein (ACBP): An aging- and disease-relevant \"autophagy checkpoint\".\n Abstract: Acyl coenzyme A binding protein (ACBP), also known as diazepam-binding inhibitor (DBI), is a phylogenetically ancient protein present in some eubacteria and the entire eukaryotic radiation. In several eukaryotic phyla, ACBP/DBI transcends its intracellular function in fatty acid metabolism because it can be released into the extracellular space. This ACBP/DBI secretion usually occurs in response to nutrient scarcity through an autophagy-dependent pathway. ACBP/DBI and its peptide fragments then act on a range of distinct receptors that diverge among phyla, namely metabotropic G protein-coupled receptor in yeast (and likely in the mammalian central nervous system), a histidine receptor kinase in slime molds, and ionotropic gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A receptors in mammals. Genetic or antibody-mediated inhibition of ACBP/DBI orthologs interferes with nutrient stress-induced adaptations such as sporulation or increased food intake in multiple species, as it enhances lifespan or healthspan in yeast, plant leaves, nematodes, and multiple mouse models. These lifespan and healthspan-extending effects of ACBP/DBI suppression are coupled to the induction of autophagy. Altogether, it appears that neutralization of extracellular ACBP/DBI results in \"autophagy checkpoint inhibition\" to unleash the anti-aging potential of autophagy. Of note, in humans, ACBP/DBI levels increase in various tissues, as well as in the plasma, in the context of aging, obesity, uncontrolled infection or cardiovascular, inflammatory, neurodegenerative, and malignant diseases.\n.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "coronis": {"__data__": {"id_": "coronis", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "coronis", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ischemic stroke": {"__data__": {"id_": "ischemic stroke", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "ischemic stroke", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "thrombo embolic events": {"__data__": {"id_": "thrombo embolic events", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "thrombo embolic events", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cerebral ischemia": {"__data__": {"id_": "cerebral ischemia", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "cerebral ischemia", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "pmid35647315": {"__data__": {"id_": "pmid35647315", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "pmid35647315: Title: Prevalence, risk factors, and long-term outcomes of cerebral ischemia in hospitalized COVID-19 patients - study rationale and protocol of the CORONIS study: A multicentre prospective cohort study.\n Abstract: Background: COVID-19 is often complicated by thrombo-embolic events including ischemic stroke. The underlying mechanisms of COVID-19-associated ischemic stroke, the incidence and risk factors of silent cerebral ischemia, and the long-term functional outcome in these patients are currently unknown. Patients and methods: CORONavirus and Ischemic Stroke (CORONIS) is a multicentre prospective cohort study investigating the prevalence, risk factors and long-term incidence of (silent) cerebral ischemia, and the long-term functional outcome among patients with COVID-19. We aim to include 200 adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19 without symptomatic ischemic stroke to investigate the prevalence of silent cerebral ischemia compared with 60 (matched) controls with MRI. In addition, we will identify potential risk factors and/or causes of cerebral ischemia in COVID-19 patients with (n = 70) or without symptomatic stroke (n = 200) by means of blood sampling, cardiac workup and brain MRI. We will measure functional outcome and cognitive function after 3 and 12 months with standardized questionnaires in all patients with COVID-19. Finally, the long-term incidence of (new) silent cerebral ischemia in patients with COVID-19 will be assessed with follow up MRI (n = 120).

Methods: This prospective double-blind, randomized controlled study was performed in 60 children undergoing VR surgery, age from 2 to 7 years. After general anesthesia, the following procedure was administrated: (1) retrobulbar block with 0.5% ropivacaine plus dexmedetomidine 1 mug/kg (group RD, n = 20), (2) retrobulbar block with 0.5% ropivacaine (group RB, n = 20), and (3) control group with general anesthesia only (group F, n = 20). Hemodynamics, postoperative pain scores, anesthetics consumption (remifentanil, propofol, fentanyl), and emergence agitation were recorded. Results: Respiratory depression was observed in 7 of the 20 patients in group F after the laryngeal mask airway was removed in the operating room, compared with none in groups RD and RB. All patients in group F required intraoperative rescue fentanyl (average intraoperative fentanyl consumption, 26.6 +- 12.6 mug per patient). Some rescue fentanyl was required in group RB (three patients required one dose of rescue fentanyl). Patients in group RD required none. Groups RD and RB reported lower pain scores than group F at 4 h postoperatively (RD group: P < 0.001; RB group: P =0.002); pain scores in group RD were lower than that in group F at 6 h postoperatively (P < 0.001). Conclusion: Retrobulbar dexmedetomidine as an adjuvant to ropivacaine is a safe and effective alternative to systemic fentanyl. This regimen provides better pain management, hemodynamic stability, and stress response suppression in pediatric VR surgery.\n.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ropivacaine": {"__data__": {"id_": "ropivacaine", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "ropivacaine", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "aortic disease": {"__data__": {"id_": "aortic disease", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "aortic disease", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "embolization": {"__data__": {"id_": "embolization", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "embolization", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "aortic atheroma": {"__data__": {"id_": "aortic atheroma", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "aortic atheroma", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "pmid37510812": {"__data__": {"id_": "pmid37510812", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "pmid37510812: Title: Defining the Role of Anaortic Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting.\n Abstract: As the population ages and co-morbidities become more prevalent, the complexity of patients presenting for coronary artery bypass surgery is increasing.

We identified microglia and C1q complement activation in hippocampal autopsy tissue of patients with sepsis and increased C1q-mediated synaptic pruning in a murine polymicrobial sepsis model. Unbiased transcriptomics of hippocampal tissue and isolated microglia derived from septic mice revealed an involvement of the innate immune system, complement activation, and up-regulation of lysosomal pathways during SAE in parallel to neuronal and synaptic damage. Microglial engulfment of C1q-tagged synapses could be prevented by stereotactic intrahippocampal injection of a specific C1q-blocking antibody. Pharmacologically targeting microglia by PLX5622, a CSF1-R inhibitor, reduced C1q levels and the number of C1q-tagged synapses, protected from neuronal damage and synapse loss, and improved neurocognitive outcome. Thus, we identified complement-dependent synaptic pruning by microglia as a crucial pathomechanism for the development of neuronal defects during SAE.\n.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "synapse loss": {"__data__": {"id_": "synapse loss", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "synapse loss", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "neuronal and synaptic damage": {"__data__": {"id_": "neuronal and synaptic damage", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "neuronal and synaptic damage", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "csf1 r": {"__data__": {"id_": "csf1 r", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "csf1 r", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "sepsis associated encephalopathy": {"__data__": {"id_": "sepsis associated encephalopathy", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "sepsis associated encephalopathy", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "proximal femoral fractures": {"__data__": {"id_": "proximal femoral fractures", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "proximal femoral fractures", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "pmid29255522": {"__data__": {"id_": "pmid29255522", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "pmid29255522: Title: Factors affecting ambulatory ability in patients aged 90 years and older following proximal femoral fractures.\n Abstract: Objectives: To investigate the details of patients' status on admission and at discharge at our hospital, to compare the ambulatory group and non-ambulatory group at discharge, and to assess the factors associated with ambulatory ability at discharge in patients aged >= 90 years with proximal femoral fractures (PFFs). Patients/Materials and Methods: Twenty patients admitted to our hospital for rehabilitation after surgery for a PFF were evaluated retrospectively. The rate of regaining ambulatory ability, presence of dementia, body mass index, serum albumin level, hemoglobin level, lymphocyte count, and functional independence measure (FIM) were assessed on admission and at discharge. Relationships between patients' ambulatory ability and ambulatory parameters were compared between the ambulatory and non-ambulatory groups. Results: The rate of regaining ambulatory ability was 55% at discharge. The serum albumin level at discharge was significantly higher in the ambulatory group than that in the non-ambulatory group. More patients had dementia on admission in the non-ambulatory group than in the ambulatory group. On admission, scores for the cognitive items of the FIM (\"expression\" and \"memory\") were significantly higher in the ambulatory group than those in the non-ambulatory group. Conclusions: The rate of ambulatory ability at discharge was 55% in those with a PFF, who were aged >= 90 years.

There is not much literature on how many patients in this setting are assessed for delirium and what tools are used. This study investigated the status of delirium assessment tools of patients in the ICU/HCU. We conducted a multicenter prospective observational study among 20 institutions. Data for patients who were admitted to and discharged from the ICU/HCU during a 1-month study period were collected from each institution using a survey sheet. The primary outcome was the usage rate of delirium assessment tools on an institution- and patient-basis. Secondary outcomes were the delirium prevalence assessed by each institution's assessment tool, comparison of delirium prevalence between delirium assessment tools, delirium prevalence at the end of ICH/HCU stay, and the relationship between potential factors related to delirium and the development of delirium. Result showed that 95% of institutions used the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC) or the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU) to assess delirium in their ICU/HCU, and the remaining one used another assessment scale. The usage rate (at least once during the ICU/HCU stay) of the ICDSC and the CAM-ICU among individual patients were 64.5% and 25.1%, and only 8.2% of enrolled patients were not assessed by any delirium assessment tool. The prevalence of delirium during ICU/HCU stay was 17.9%, and the prevalence of delirium at the end of the ICU/HCU stay was 5.9%. In conclusion, all institutions used delirium assessment tools in the ICU/HCU, and most patients received delirium assessment.

This polymorphism was investigated in two types of studies: (1) the association study in a whole group of alcoholics (116 patients fulfilling ICD-10 alcohol dependence (AD) criteria and 255 controls, Polish descent) and homogenous overlapping subgroups of patients with: a history of delirium tremens and/or alcohol seizures, early age of onset of alcoholism (AOO<26 years), a co-occurrence of dissocial personality disorder, a history of familial alcoholism; (2) the family-based study (using Transmission Disequilibrium Test (TDT) in 100 Polish families with alcohol dependence). The history of alcoholism was obtained using SSAGA (Polish version). GRIK3 functional polymorphism was determined using PCR. TDT revealed an adequate transmission of both alleles to the affected offspring in the whole group of alcohol families (29 x Ser, 24 x Ala; chi2=0.472; d.f.=1; p=0.492) and in the homogenous subgroups of families. No significant associations between any of the above mentioned alcohol phenotypes and Ser310 allele were observed (the whole AD group: p=0.66 AD with delirium and/or seizures: p=0.521; early onset AD: p=0.868; AD with familial history of alcoholism: p=0.798 and AD with dissocial personality disorder: p=0.618). These findings do not seem to support the hypothesis of the role of this polymorphism in the pathogenesis of alcoholism.\n.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "pmid32121373": {"__data__": {"id_": "pmid32121373", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "pmid32121373: Title: A Review of Cases of Marijuana and Violence.\n Abstract: Marijuana is the most consumed illicit drug in the world, with over 192 million users. Due to the current legalization push of marijuana in the United States, there has been a lack of oversight regarding its public health policies, as marijuana advocates downplay the drug's negative effects. This paper's approach is from a public health perspective, focusing specifically on the cases of violence amongst some marijuana users. Here, we present 14 cases of violence with chronic marijuana users that highlight reoccurring consequences of: marijuana induced paranoia (exaggerated, unfounded distrust) and marijuana induced psychosis (radical personality change, loss of contact with reality). When individuals suffering from pre-existing medical conditions use marijuana in an attempt to alleviate their symptoms, ultimately this worsens their conditions over time. Although marijuana effects depend on the individual's endocannabinoid receptors (which control behavioral functions, like aggression) and the potency level of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in the drug, scientifically documented links between certain marijuana users and violence do exist. Wider public awareness of the risks and side effects of marijuana, as well as a more prudent health policy, and government agency monitoring of the drug's composition, creation, and distribution, are needed and recommended.\n.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "tetrahydrocannabinol": {"__data__": {"id_": "tetrahydrocannabinol", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "tetrahydrocannabinol", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "personality change": {"__data__": {"id_": "personality change", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "personality change", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "paranoia": {"__data__": {"id_": "paranoia", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "paranoia", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "marijuana and violence": {"__data__": {"id_": "marijuana and violence", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "marijuana and violence", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "pmid37848812": {"__data__": {"id_": "pmid37848812", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "pmid37848812: Title: Serum sodium improvement: change in Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment parameters in geriatric patients with hyponatremia.\n Abstract: BACKGROUND: Hyponatremia presents with symptoms considered age-associated in the elderly. We assess the change in Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) parameters after hyponatremia improvement in hospitalized geriatric patients. METHODS: We took 100 hyponatremic and same number of eunatremic geriatric patients (> 60 years) who were comorbidity, presenting-complaints, and age-matched. Four CGA parameters were utilized, the new Hindi Mental State Examination (HMSE), Barthel's index of activities of daily living (ADL), Timed up and go Test (TUG), and handgrip strength by hand dynamometer (HG). We analyzed these at admission and discharge, and their relationship with change in sodium levels. RESULTS: Average age was 68.1 +- 5.8 years, with males constituting 75%. The CGA parameters demonstrated worse values amongst the hyponatremia than the normonatremia group. Severe hyponatremia group showed worse CGA scores in comparison with moderate and mild. With improvement in sodium level, the improvements in ADL, TUG, and HMSE scores were greater in the hyponatremia group (8.8 +- 10.1, 2.2 +- 2.5, and 1.7 +- 2.3 respectively) in comparison to the normonatremia reference group (4.7 +- 9.0, 1 +- 2.0, and 0.7 +- 1.3 respectively, P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Our study is the first utilizing HMSE to assess change in cognitive ability with improvement in serum sodium levels in the Indian elderly. Hyponatremic patients show worse baseline CGA parameters, and hyponatremia severity correlates with worse motor and cognitive function. Improvement in the serum sodium level improves the CGA parameters.

This study aimed to determine the differences in perioperative blood loss, transfusion rates, and the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) with and without the use of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) in patients undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass graft surgery (OPCAB). METHODS: This single-center, retrospective study included 106 adult patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery without cardiopulmonary bypass from January 2018 to March 2022. The patients were divided into two groups based on intraoperative ventilator settings: the zero-PEEP (ZEEP) group and the PEEP group. The primary outcome was the perioperative transfusion rate from the intraoperative period to postoperative 7 day. The incidence of PPCs was recorded for 1 week post-operatively. Logistic regression analysis was performed for statistical analysis. RESULTS: The average PEEP in the PEEP group was 4.92 +- 0.42 cmH2O. Multiple regression analysis indicated that lower mean airway pressure during surgery tend to associate with intraoperative lower blood loss. The intraoperative transfusion rates in the ZEEP group were significantly lower than those in the PEEP group (ZEEP:14%, PEEP 38.4%, P = 0.02). Logistic regression analysis revealed that ZEEP (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.13, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.04-0.78) and Society of Thoracic Surgeons(STS) scores (adjusted OR 2.31, 95% CI 1.53-3.49) were significantly associated with a reduced requirement for perioperative transfusions. No significant difference was observed between the two groups in terms of PPCs (p = 0.824). Atelectasis was the most common complication in both groups (ZEEP: 35.7%, PEEP: 40%, P = 0.832). CONCLUSIONS: ZEEP and STS scores were associated with significantly reduced requirement for perioperative transfusion rates during elective OPCAB surgery. However, ZEEP did not significantly affect the incidence of PPCs.\n.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "delirious disorders": {"__data__": {"id_": "delirious disorders", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "delirious disorders", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "pmid9791918": {"__data__": {"id_": "pmid9791918", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "pmid9791918: Title: [Schizo-affective psychosis manifested in adolescence].\n Abstract: 141 patients with schizoaffective psychosis were observed: 70 patients in the period of the first manifest attack and 71 ones 10-20 years after it (catamnestic group).

The course of the psychosis was determined by peculiarities of nonaffective delirious disorders in clinical picture of manifest attacks. 3 main variants of such attacks are recognized: with domination of delusion of imagination (the 1st type); with domination of a delusion of perception (the 2nd type); with domination of a delirium of perception combined with manifestations of acute interpretative delirium (the 3d type). The 1st and 2nd types of manifest attacks correspond to ICD-10 criteria of schizoaffective psychosis.

However, it is unclear which complications patients deem most severe. This study aimed to have patients classify potential complications following abdominal aortic aneurysm surgery based on severity using best-worst scaling. METHODS: Dutch patients with an abdominal aortic aneurysm, either under surveillance or following surgery, received a survey with 33 potential surgical complications. The survey presented these complications in sets of three. Patients had to classify one of three complications as most severe and one as least severe. After all participants had completed the survey, the number of times a complication was classified as most severe was subtracted from the number of times that the complication was classified as least severe, thus resulting in a best-worse scaling score. Complications with the lowest scores were ranked as more severe. RESULTS: Fifty out of 79 participating patients completed the survey in full. Patients classified the following ten complications as most severe: Below-ankle amputation, aneurysm rupture, stroke, renal failure, type 1 endoleak, spinal cord ischaemia, peripheral bypass surgery, bowel lesion, myocardial infarction and heart failure. Haematoma was ranked as the least severe complication. CONCLUSION: This best-worst scaling study enabled patients to classify complications following abdominal aortic aneurysm surgery based on severity. Vascular surgeons should discuss the ten complications deemed most severe with their patients and help their patients to effectively weigh the benefits of surgery against the harms patients themselves deem important, thereby improving shared decision making.\n.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "myocardial infarction": {"__data__": {"id_": "myocardial infarction", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "myocardial infarction", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "aneurysm rupture": {"__data__": {"id_": "aneurysm rupture", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "aneurysm rupture", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "hepatocellular carcinoma": {"__data__": {"id_": "hepatocellular carcinoma", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "hepatocellular carcinoma", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "pmid38248106": {"__data__": {"id_": "pmid38248106", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "pmid38248106: Title: Radiofrequency Ablation versus Surgical Resection in Elderly Hepatocellular Carcinoma: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.\n Abstract: Although the disease burden of elderly cancer patients is rapidly increasing, reliable scientific information, value and preference information of domestic patients, and standardized guidelines for determining the treatment of elderly cancer patients are lacking. The aim of this study is to compare the therapeutic effects of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and surgery in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients aged 65 years or older. For the meta-analysis, the databases including PubMed (MEDLINE), EMBASE, OVID Medline, and the Cochrane Library were systematically searched. After the abstract-based review by two investigators, selected manuscripts were read in detail. The surgery group showed higher overall survival (OS) (HR 1.44, 95% CI 1.22-1.70) and disease-free survival (DFS) (HR 1.40, 95% CI 1.00-1.97) than the RFA group. This was also shown in small HCC of less than 3 cm (OS, HR 1.42, 95% CI 1.00-2.03; DFS, HR 1.32, 95% CI 0.91-1.91). This might be related to the high local recurrence in the RFA group (OR 4.90, 95% 2.16-11.08). On the other hand, adverse events were significantly lower in the RFA group (OR 0.22, 95% CI 0.14-0.36), which led to a decrease in the duration of hospital stay (mean difference -14.88 days, 95% CI -22.44--7.32). In elderly HCC patients, survival in the surgery group was significantly higher than in the RFA group, but various complications tended to increase; so, appropriate patient selection is required.\n.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "brain tuberculosis": {"__data__": {"id_": "brain tuberculosis", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "brain tuberculosis", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "brain neoplasms": {"__data__": {"id_": "brain neoplasms", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "brain neoplasms", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "catatonic signs": {"__data__": {"id_": "catatonic signs", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "catatonic signs", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "epilepsy": {"__data__": {"id_": "epilepsy", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "epilepsy", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "nmdar encephalitis": {"__data__": {"id_": "nmdar encephalitis", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "nmdar encephalitis", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "catatonic delirium": {"__data__": {"id_": "catatonic delirium", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "catatonic delirium", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "catatonia": {"__data__": {"id_": "catatonia", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "catatonia", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "pmid35040665": {"__data__": {"id_": "pmid35040665", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "pmid35040665: Title: Clinical Significance of Delirium With Catatonic Signs in Patients With Neurological Disorders.\n Abstract: OBJECTIVE: According to DSM-5, catatonia and delirium are mutually exclusive clinical syndromes. The investigators explored the co-occurrence of delirium and catatonia (i.e., catatonic delirium) and the clinical significance of this syndrome with a sample of neurological patients. METHODS: This prospective study with consecutive sampling included patients diagnosed with delirium at the National Institute of Neurology and Neurosurgery of Mexico. DSM-5 criteria for delirium, the Confusion Assessment Method, and the Delirium Rating Scale-Revised-98 were used to select and characterize patients. Catatonia was assessed using the Bush-Francis Catatonia Rating Scale and DSM-5 diagnostic criteria. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify etiological factors associated with catatonic delirium. RESULTS: A total of 264 patients with delirium were included, 61 (23%) of whom fulfilled the criteria for catatonia and delirium simultaneously. Brain tumors, subarachnoid hemorrhage, acute hydrocephalus, and ischemic stroke were associated with delirium without catatonic signs. Catatonic delirium was observed among patients with encephalitis, epilepsy, brain neoplasms, and brain tuberculosis. After multivariate analysis, the association between catatonic delirium and encephalitis (both viral and anti-N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor [NMDAR]) was confirmed. CONCLUSIONS: Delirium is a common complication of neurological diseases, and it can coexist with catatonia. The recognition of catatonic delirium has clinical significance in terms of etiology, as it was significantly associated with viral and anti-NMDAR encephalitis.\n.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "drug": {"__data__": {"id_": "drug", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "drug", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "pmid28077106": {"__data__": {"id_": "pmid28077106", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "pmid28077106: Title: Age of onset of substance use and psychosocial problems among individuals with substance use disorders.\n Abstract: BACKGROUND: Substance use is generally initiated in adolescence or early adulthood and is commonly associated with several physical, psychological, emotional and social problems. The objective of this study is to assess the age of onset of substance use differences on psychosocial problems among individuals with substance use disorders (SUDs) residing in drug rehabilitation centers. METHODS: A descriptive cross sectional research design was carried out. Probability Proportional to Size (PPS) sampling technique was used to select the drug rehabilitation centers and all the respondents meeting the inclusion criteria of the selected seven rehabilitation centers were taken as a sample and comprised of 221 diagnosed individuals with SUDs. A semi structured self administered questionnaires were used to collect the information regarding demographic and substance use related characteristics. A standard tool Drug Use Screening Inventory-Revised (DUSI-R) was used to assess the psychosocial problems among individuals with SUDs. Data were analyzed using both descriptive and inferential statistics. Multivariate general linear model (MANOVA and MANCOVA) was used to evaluate differences in psychosocial problems between early vs late onset substance users. RESULT: The age of onset of substance use was significantly associated with psychosocial problems. The mean psychosocial problem scores were higher in early onset substance user (17 years or younger) than late onset substance user (18 years or higher) in various domains of DUSI-R even after controlling confounding factors. The two groups (early vs late) differed significantly in relation to age, gender, occupational status, current types of substance use, frequency of use, mode of substance use and relapse history. CONCLUSION: The study indicated that early onset substance users are at higher risk for psychosocial problems in various areas of life such as Behavior Pattern, Psychiatric disorder, Family system, Peer relationship, Leisure/Recreation and Work adjustment compared to late onset substance users. It highlights the need for early prevention, screening, and timely intervention among those individuals.\n.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "psychiatric disorder": {"__data__": {"id_": "psychiatric disorder", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "psychiatric disorder", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "substance use disorders": {"__data__": {"id_": "substance use disorders", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "substance use disorders", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "psychosocial problems": {"__data__": {"id_": "psychosocial problems", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "psychosocial problems", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "postoperative complications": {"__data__": {"id_": "postoperative complications", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "postoperative complications", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "lung cancer": {"__data__": {"id_": "lung cancer", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "lung cancer", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "pmid30948695": {"__data__": {"id_": "pmid30948695", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "pmid30948695: Title: Perioperative Dexmedetomidine Reduces Delirium in Elderly Patients after Lung Cancer Surgery.\n Abstract: BACKGROUND: Delirium, which is one of the most disturbing postoperative complications in elderly patients, shows high morbidity in patients undergoing lung cancer surgery. Dexmedetomidine (DEX) is considered a potential prophylactic agent for preventing patients' delirium after lung cancer surgery. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Medical records of lung cancer patients over 65 years old with radical pulmonary resection at Henan Provincial People's Hospital from January 2015 to December 2017, China, were evaluated. Patients, care-providers, and investigators were all blinded to group assignment. DEX was administered in the preoperative and intraoperative periods. The incidence of delirium was calculated based on the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC). Scores of >=4 and 1-3 points represent the diagnoses of delirium and a pre-delirious state, respectively. RESULTS: During postoperative day 1 (POD 1) to POD 7, delirium occurs in both groups. During postoperative POD 1 to POD 7, the incidence of delirium is lower in the DEX group than that in the control group. Furthermore, there are more mild delirium patients but fewer moderate and severe delirium patients in the DEX group compared with the control group. Finally, patients in the DEX group have a shorter duration of delirium, lower numeric pain rating scale during movement and better sleep quality. CONCLUSION: Preoperative and intraoperative application of DEX can reduce the incidence and intensity of delirium after pulmonary resection in elderly patients with lung cancer.\n.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "methaqualone": {"__data__": {"id_": "methaqualone", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "methaqualone", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "pmid33760714": {"__data__": {"id_": "pmid33760714", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "pmid33760714: Title: Return of the Quaaludes?

Methods: SL-164 and its hydroxy metabolites were detected in serum and urine via liquid chromatography-quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-QTOF-MS). Results: The pronounced delirium was treated with benzodiazepines and neuroleptics; temporary medical restraint had to be applied.

Conclusions: Although methaqualone was a popular and widespread sedative in the 1950s and 60 s before its discontinuation in the USA in 1985, derivatives of the methaqualone class have not previously played a large role as drugs of abuse in the rapidly growing market of new psychoactive substances.

Nonadherence can lead to increased relapse and hospitalization rates. This article reports hospitalization data before and after initiation of olanzapine long-acting injection (LAI), a depot antipsychotic. METHODS: Data were assessed from an ongoing, multinational, prospective, observational post-authorisation safety study being conducted to evaluate post-injection delirium/sedation syndrome (PDSS), an adverse reaction that can occur following injection of olanzapine LAI. Eligible patients were aged >=18 years, diagnosed with schizophrenia, were prescribed olanzapine LAI, and lived outside the United States. Psychiatric hospitalization and medication data were collected retrospectively for the 6-month period before study entry and prospectively throughout the study. Paired t-tests and McNemar's tests were used to assess changes in hospitalization incidence and duration. Stepwise Cox proportional hazards models assessed factors associated with hospitalizations. Analyses were based on data from the first 3 years of the continuously enrolling study (N = 668). RESULTS: The average duration of olanzapine LAI exposure for all patients was 0.768 years. Of the 529 patients who received at least 1 injection of olanzapine LAI and were not hospitalized at study entry, 8.1% had at least 1 subsequent psychiatric hospitalization with a mean duration of 2.0 days. Of the 288 patients who had a >6-month follow-up, 8.3% had at least 1 post-baseline psychiatric hospitalization with a mean duration of 2.3 days. The incidence of hospitalizations in the 6-month period after treatment was significantly lower than that in the 6-month period prior to treatment (8.3 vs 32.6%, respectively; P < 0.001). Furthermore, mean hospitalization duration decreased from 11.5 days in the 6-month period before treatment to 2.3 days in the 6-month period after treatment (P < 0.001). Psychiatric hospitalization in the prior 12 months (P < 0.0001) and recreational drug use within 24 h of baseline visit (P = 0.015) were identified as potential predictors of time to first psychiatric hospitalization after beginning to take olanzapine LAI. At the time of interim analysis, 5 PDSS events had occurred, which was too few for a full analysis of those events. CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate a significant reduction in the incidence and days of hospitalization from the 6-month period before to the 6-month period after olanzapine LAI initiation, which suggests reduced relapse and hospitalization during treatment. Results should be interpreted with caution due to the observational nature of the study and use of retrospective baseline data.\n.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "psychiatric": {"__data__": {"id_": "psychiatric", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "psychiatric", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "memory difficulties": {"__data__": {"id_": "memory difficulties", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "memory difficulties", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "pmid25685140": {"__data__": {"id_": "pmid25685140", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "pmid25685140: Title: The Progression of Alzheimer's Disease Can Be Assessed with a Short Version of the CERAD Neuropsychological Battery: The Kuopio ALSOVA Study.\n Abstract: BACKGROUND/AIMS: Measuring and predicting Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression is important in order to adjust treatment and allocate care resources. We aimed to identify a combination of subtests from the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease Neuropsychological Battery (CERAD-NB) that best correlated with AD progression in follow-up as well as to predict AD progression. METHOD: A total of 236 participants with very mild [Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) = 0.5] or mild AD (CDR = 1.0) at baseline were followed up for 3 years. The CERAD-NB and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) were used to assess cognition, and the CDR scale sum of boxes (CDR-sb) was employed to evaluate AD progression. Generalized estimating equations were used to develop models to predict and follow up disease progression. RESULTS: Performance declined on all CERAD-NB subtests. The ability of the separate subtests to distinguish between groups (baseline CDR = 0.5 or 1.0) diminished during follow-up. The best combination of subtests that explained 62% of CDR-sb variance in follow-up included verbal fluency, constructional praxis, the clock drawing test, and the MMSE. Baseline values of the same combination predicted 37% of the CDR-sb change. CONCLUSION: A short version of the CERAD-NB subtests provides a promising and time-efficient alternative for measuring cognitive deterioration during AD follow-up. Although the initial signs of AD include memory difficulties, it may be useful to assess non-memory tasks in follow-up.\n.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cognitive deterioration": {"__data__": {"id_": "cognitive deterioration", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "cognitive deterioration", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "pmid39283972": {"__data__": {"id_": "pmid39283972", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "pmid39283972: Title: Perioperative Systemic Corticosteroids in Modern Total Hip and Knee Arthroplasty: A Primer for Clinical Practice.\n Abstract: >> Perioperative corticosteroids are strongly recommended for reducing the incidence and severity of postoperative nausea and vomiting following elective total hip or total knee arthroplasty.>> Corticosteroids may reduce postoperative pain and opioid requirements.

however, the perioperative administration of 8 to 16 mg dexamethasone, or equivalent steroid, appears reasonable and safe in most cases.\n.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "hyperglycemia": {"__data__": {"id_": "hyperglycemia", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "hyperglycemia", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bone cement implantation": {"__data__": {"id_": "bone cement implantation", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "bone cement implantation", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dexamethasone": {"__data__": {"id_": "dexamethasone", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "dexamethasone", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "venous thromboembolism": {"__data__": {"id_": "venous thromboembolism", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "venous thromboembolism", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "steroid": {"__data__": {"id_": "steroid", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "steroid", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "physical impairments": {"__data__": {"id_": "physical impairments", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "physical impairments", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "crp": {"__data__": {"id_": "crp", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "crp", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "impaired quadriceps": {"__data__": {"id_": "impaired quadriceps", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "impaired quadriceps", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "pmid32730305": {"__data__": {"id_": "pmid32730305", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "pmid32730305: Title: Markers of protein-energy wasting and physical performance in haemodialysis patients: A cross-sectional study.\n Abstract: BACKGROUND: Physical impairments are common in uraemia, as reflected by the high risk of falls of haemodialysis (HD) patients. Furthermore, these patients often suffer from malnutrition. OBJECTIVE: Up to now, it is unknown which aspects of physical performance are predominantly driven by malnutrition in HD patients. As this answer could steer different interventions, the aim of this study was to evaluate the cross-sectional relationship between nutritional status, muscle strength, exercise capacity and the risk of falls. METHODS: This study recruited HD patients between December 2016 and March 2018 from two hospital-based and five satellite dialysis units (registration number on clinicaltrial.gov: NCT03910426). The mini-nutritional assessment scale as well as objective measures of protein-energy wasting were obtained (total iron-binding capacity, total protein levels, and CRP). Physical assessment included muscle strength (quadriceps, handgrip force, and sit-to-stand test), exercise capacity (six-minute walking test) and the risk of falls (Tinetti, FICSIT, and dialysis fall index). Their interrelationship was analysed by ridge regression models. RESULTS: Out of 113 HD patients (mean age 67 years +- 16.1, 57.5% male) 36.3% were malnourished according to the mini-nutritional assessment scale and a majority had impaired quadriceps force (86.7%), six-minute walking test (92%), and an increased risk of falls (73.5%). Total protein and CRP levels were identified as relevant nutritional factors in the association with physical performance. Nutritional parameters explained 9.2% of the variance in the risk of falls and 7.6% of the variance in exercise capacity. No conclusive association was found between nutritional status and muscle strength. CONCLUSION: Protein-energy wasting is a determinant of the risk of falls and exercise capacity in patients on HD. The association between malnutrition and muscle weakness remains inconclusive.\n.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "protein energy wasting": {"__data__": {"id_": "protein energy wasting", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "protein energy wasting", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "uraemia": {"__data__": {"id_": "uraemia", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "uraemia", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "pmid36721095": {"__data__": {"id_": "pmid36721095", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "pmid36721095: Title: Rapid emergence from dexmedetomidine sedation in Sprague Dawley rats by repurposing an alpha2-adrenergic receptor competitive antagonist in combination with caffeine.\n Abstract: BACKGROUND: The alpha2 adrenergic receptor agonist dexmedetomidine is an important intravenous sedative with analgesic properties. Currently available dexmedetomidine reversal agents, like the alpha2-receptor antagonist atipamezole, cause serious adverse effects at the large dosages required for effective reversal; they are not used clinically. Without reversal agents, emergence times from dexmedetomidine sedation are slow. In this study we tested the ability of low-dose atipamezole, in combination with caffeine, to reverse dexmedetomidine sedation. The low dose of atipamezole employed should not be associated with unwanted effects. METHODS: Two different sedation protocols were employed. In the first protocol, a bolus of dexmedetomidine was rapidly applied and the drug was allowed to equilibrate for 10 min before rats received either saline (as control) or low-dose atipamezole with caffeine. Following this procedure, rats were placed on their backs. Emergence from sedation was the time for rats to recover their righting reflex and stand with 4 paws on the floor. A second sedation protocol simulated a pediatric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. Adult rats were sedated with dexmedetomidine for one hour followed by 30 min with both dexmedetomidine and propofol. At the end of 90 min, rats received either saline (control) or a combination of low-dose atipamezole, and caffeine. Recovery of the righting reflex was used as a proxy for emergence from sedation. RESULTS: Emergence from sedation, the time for rats to recover their righting reflex, decreased by ~ 90% when using an atipamezole dose ~ 20 fold lower than manufacturer's recommendation, supplemented with caffeine. Using an atipamezole dose ~ tenfold lower than recommended, with caffeine, emergence times decreased by ~ 97%. A different stimulant, forskolin, when tested, was as effective as caffeine. For the MRI simulation, emergence times were decreased by ~ 93% by low-dose atipamezole with caffeine. CONCLUSIONS: Low dose atipamezole with caffeine was effective at reversing dexmedetomidine sedation. Emergence was rapid and the rats regained not only their righting reflex but also their balance and their ability to carry out complex behaviors. These findings suggest that the combination of low dose atipamezole with caffeine may permit rapid clinical reversal of dexmedetomidine without unwanted effects.\n.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "atipamezole": {"__data__": {"id_": "atipamezole", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "atipamezole", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "caffeine": {"__data__": {"id_": "caffeine", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "caffeine", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "forskolin": {"__data__": {"id_": "forskolin", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "forskolin", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "hypercapnic": {"__data__": {"id_": "hypercapnic", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "hypercapnic", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "hypercapnia": {"__data__": {"id_": "hypercapnia", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "hypercapnia", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "pmid36405895": {"__data__": {"id_": "pmid36405895", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "pmid36405895: Title: Association between the reactivity of local cerebral oxygen saturation after hypo-to-hypercapnic tests and delirium after abdominal surgery in older adults: A prospective study.\n Abstract: Objective: This study aimed to investigate the correlation between changes in regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2) and postoperative delirium in older adults undergoing major abdominal surgery. Materials and methods: This prospective study enrolled older adults scheduled for elective major abdominal surgery at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University from August 2021 to January 2022. The change in rSO2 from baseline was determined using the hypo-to-hypercapnic test. The main study outcome was the occurrence of postoperative delirium. Results: A total of 101 participants were included for analysis, of whom 16 (15.8%) developed postoperative delirium. Compared with non-delirium participants, the mean arterial pressure and heart rate were not significantly different in the postoperative delirium group at T0, T1, T2, T3, T4, and T6 (all Pinteraction > 0.05), but the delirium group had lower pH, lower PaO2, and higher lactate levels at T4, T5, and T6 (all Pinteraction < 0.05). rSO2 at T0, T1, T2, T3, T4, and T6 was 69.0 (63.2-75.2), 70.7 +- 7.3, 68.2 +- 7.5, 72.1 +- 8.0, 69.9 +- 7.8, 67.4 +- 7.2, and 71.7 +- 8.1, respectively.

Limitations to visits increase the risk of psychological distress in family members. During the COVID-19 pandemic, in-person visiting restrictions were introduced to prevent the spread of infection. PURPOSE: To explore the experience of in-person visiting restrictions imposed during the pandemic on family members of patients with COVID-19 admitted to an intensive care unit. METHOD: Qualitative method with thematic analysis. Individual semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted. FINDINGS: We interviewed 21 family members. The results are presented in one overall theme with two main themes and five sub-themes. The theme 'Striving for closeness even at a distance describes the experience of being kept at a physical distance when participants needed closeness the most. Even participants who were allowed in-person visits perceived a 'distance' due to personal protective equipment or because they could only view the patient from a window. Participants reported that contact with and information about the patient was of utmost importance. Visits were viewed as essential in providing for the patient's wellbeing. Meaningful contact with the ICU team was vital for getting useful information. Phone calls became a lifeline, with digital aids such as video calls used occasionally to overcome the feeling of distance. CONCLUSION: Visiting restrictions imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic made straightforward and comprehensible communication of information from the ICU team more essential to reduce family members' perceptions of distance and exclusion from the intensive care unit.\n.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "h2o": {"__data__": {"id_": "h2o", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "h2o", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "loxapine": {"__data__": {"id_": "loxapine", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "loxapine", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "withdrawal syndrome": {"__data__": {"id_": "withdrawal syndrome", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "withdrawal syndrome", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "pmid20459867": {"__data__": {"id_": "pmid20459867", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "pmid20459867: Title: Beneficial effects of loxapine on agitation and breathing patterns during weaning from mechanical ventilation.\n Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Interruption of sedation during weaning from mechanical ventilation often leads to patient agitation because of withdrawal syndrome. We tested the short-term efficacy and tolerance of loxapine in this situation. METHODS: Nineteen mechanically ventilated patients with marked agitation after sedation withdrawal were included. Three agitation scales, the Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS), the Motor Activity Assessment Scale (MAAS), and the Ramsay and physiological variables (respiratory rate, airway occlusion pressure during the first 0.1 second of inspiration (P0.1), heart rate and systolic arterial blood pressure) were recorded before and after loxapine administration. RESULTS: Loxapine dramatically improved all agitation scores (RASS and MASS decreased from 2 +/- 0 to -1.1 +/- 2.3, and 5.4 +/- 0.5 to 2.7 +/- 1.6, respectively; Ramsay increased from 1.0 +/- 0 to 3.5 +/- 1.5, 60 minutes after loxapine administration, P < 0.05 for all scores) as well as P0.1 (6 +/- 4.2 to 1.8 +/- 1.8 cm H2O; P < 0.05) and respiratory rate (from 31.2 +/- 7.2 to 23.4 +/- 7.8; P < 0.05) without hemodynamic adverse events. No side effects occurred. Sixteen (84%) patients were successfully managed with loxapine, sedation was resumed in two others, and one patient self-extubated without having to be reintubated.

The acute and long-term effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the nervous system pose major public health challenges. Patients with SARS-CoV-2 present diverse symptoms of the central nervous system. Exploring the mechanism of coronavirus damage to the nervous system is essential for reducing the long-term neurological complications of COVID-19. Despite rapid progress in characterizing SARS-CoV-2, the long-term effects of COVID-19 on the brain remain unclear. The possible mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 injury to the central nervous system include: 1) direct injury of nerve cells, 2) activation of the immune system and inflammatory cytokines caused by systemic infection, 3) a high affinity of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein for the angiotensin-converting enzyme ACE2, 4) cerebrovascular disease caused by hypoxia and coagulation dysfunction, and 5) a systemic inflammatory response that promotes cognitive impairment and neurodegenerative diseases. Although we do not fully understand the mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 causes nerve injury, we hope to provide a framework by reviewing the clinical manifestations, complications, and possible mechanisms of neurological damage caused by SARS-CoV-2. With hope, this will facilitate the early identification, diagnosis, and treatment of possible neurological sequelae, which could contribute toward improving patient prognosis and preventing transmission.\n.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "angiotensin converting enzyme": {"__data__": {"id_": "angiotensin converting enzyme", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "angiotensin converting enzyme", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "neurological sequelae": {"__data__": {"id_": "neurological sequelae", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "neurological sequelae", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "coagulation dysfunction": {"__data__": {"id_": "coagulation dysfunction", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "coagulation dysfunction", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "neurodegenerative diseases": {"__data__": {"id_": "neurodegenerative diseases", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "neurodegenerative diseases", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "coronavirus damage to the nervous system": {"__data__": {"id_": "coronavirus damage to the nervous system", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "coronavirus damage to the nervous system", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "hypoxia": {"__data__": {"id_": "hypoxia", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "hypoxia", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "nerve injury": {"__data__": {"id_": "nerve injury", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "nerve injury", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "pmid29697753": {"__data__": {"id_": "pmid29697753", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "pmid29697753: Title: Attention, arousal and other rapid bedside screening instruments for delirium in older patients: a systematic review of test accuracy studies.\n Abstract: Objective: delirium occurs frequently in frail patients but is easily missed. Screening with a rapid, easy-to-use and highly sensitive instrument might help improve recognition. The aim of this study was to review attention, arousal and other rapid bedside screening instruments for delirium in older patients. Methods: a literature search was performed in PubMed, PsycINFO and Embase. We scrutinized forward citations in Google Scholar, and references of included articles and prior reviews. We included studies among older patients that investigated the sensitivity and specificity of delirium screening instruments that could be administered in 3 min or less, and did not require surrogate information. We extracted study characteristics, risk of bias, sensitivity and specificity. Results: we identified 27 studies among 4,766 patients in hospitals and nursing homes. They tested many different single and several combined screening instruments. Prevalence of delirium varied between 4% and 57%. Only one study scored a low risk of bias on all domains. Sensitivity varied between 17% and 100%, and specificity between 38% and 99%. Of the 22 tests with sensitivity >=90%, seven also had specificity >=80% in older patients in general. These results were approximately reproduced for the Observational Scale of Level of Arousal (OSLA) and Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale (RASS): sensitivity and specificity were >80%. Conclusion: two arousal tests-OSLA and RASS-had reproduced high sensitivity and specificity in older patients. Nurses can administer these tests during daily interaction with patients.

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: National administrative database including 465 U.S. hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: Individuals aged 65 and older without known indications for APMs who underwent cardiac surgery from 2004 to 2014 (N=293,212). MEASUREMENTS: Postoperative exposure to any APMs and potentially excessive dosing were examined. Hospital-level APM prescribing intensity was defined as the proportion of individuals newly treated with APMs in the postoperative period. RESULTS: The rate of APM use declined from 8.8% in 2004 to 6.2% in 2014 (p<.001). Use of haloperidol (parenteral 7.0% to 4.5%, p<.001; oral: 1.9% to 0.5%, p<.001), and risperidone (1.1% to 0.3%, p<.001) declined, whereas quetiapine use tripled (0.6% to 1.9%, p=.03). Hospital APM prescribing intensity varied widely, from 0.3% to 35.6%, across 465 hospitals. Treated individuals at higher-prescribing hospitals were more likely to receive APMs on the day of discharge (highest vs lowest quintile: 15.1% vs 9.6%; p<.001) and for a longer duration (4.8 vs 3.7 days; p<.001) than those at lower-prescribing hospitals. Delirium was the strongest risk factor for APM exposure (odds ratio=9.73, 95% confidence interval=9.02-10.5), whereas none of the hospital characteristics were significantly associated. The rate of potentially excessive dosing declined (60.7% to 44.9%, p<.001), and risk factors for potentially excessive dosing were similar to those for any APM exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest highly variable prescribing cultures and raise concerns about inappropriate use, highlighting the need for better evidence to guide APM prescribing in hospitalized older adults after cardiac surgery.\n.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "risperidone": {"__data__": {"id_": "risperidone", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "risperidone", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "quetiapine": {"__data__": {"id_": "quetiapine", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "quetiapine", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "hypertension": {"__data__": {"id_": "hypertension", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "hypertension", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "diabetes": {"__data__": {"id_": "diabetes", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "diabetes", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "pmid33561673": {"__data__": {"id_": "pmid33561673", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "pmid33561673: Title: Discovering symptom patterns of COVID-19 patients using association rule mining.\n Abstract: BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic is a significant public health crisis that is hitting hard on people's health, well-being, and freedom of movement, and affecting the global economy. Scientists worldwide are competing to develop therapeutics and vaccines; currently, three drugs and two vaccine candidates have been given emergency authorization use. However, there are still questions of efficacy with regard to specific subgroups of patients and the vaccine's scalability to the general public. Under such circumstances, understanding COVID-19 symptoms is vital in initial triage; it is crucial to distinguish the severity of cases for effective management and treatment. This study aimed to discover symptom patterns and overall symptom rules, including rules disaggregated by age, sex, chronic condition, and mortality status, among COVID-19 patients. METHODS: This study was a retrospective analysis of COVID-19 patient data made available online by the Wolfram Data Repository through May 27, 2020. We applied a widely used rule-based machine learning technique called association rule mining to identify frequent symptoms and define patterns in the rules discovered. RESULT: In total, 1,560 patients with COVID-19 were included in the study, with a median age of 52 years. The most frequently occurring symptom was fever (67%), followed by cough (37%), malaise/body soreness (11%), pneumonia (11%), and sore throat (8%). Myocardial infarction, heart failure, and renal disease were present in less than 1% of patients. The top ten significant symptom rules (out of 71 generated) showed cough, septic shock, and respiratory distress syndrome as frequent consequents. If a patient had a breathing problem and sputum production, then, there was higher confidence of that patient having a cough; if cardiac disease, renal disease, or pneumonia was present, then there was a higher confidence of septic shock or respiratory distress syndrome. Symptom rules differed between younger and older patients and between male and female patients. Patients who had chronic conditions or died of COVID-19 had more severe symptom rules than those patients who did not have chronic conditions or survived of COVID-19. Concerning chronic condition rules among 147 patients, if a patient had diabetes, prerenal azotemia, and coronary bypass surgery, there was a certainty of hypertension. CONCLUSION: The most frequently reported symptoms in patients with COVID-19 were fever, cough, pneumonia, and sore throat; while 1% had severe symptoms, such as septic shock, respiratory distress syndrome, and respiratory failure. Symptom rules differed by age and sex. Patients with chronic disease and patients who died of COVID-19 had severe symptom rules more specifically, cardiovascular-related symptoms accompanied by pneumonia, fever, and cough as consequents.\n.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"},

growing trend in surgical care is the investigation and incorporation of multimodal interventions into standardized programs. Additionally, manual therapies such as osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) are being used with patients in surgical care. Yet the scientific dialogue and the use of OMT in surgical care are currently insubstantial. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to present an overview of published research articles within the subject field of OMT in surgical care. METHOD: Summative review of peer-reviewed research articles published in osteopathic journals during the period 1990 to 2017. In total, 10 articles were identified. RESULT: Previous research has been conducted within the areas of abdominal, thoracic, gynecological, and/or orthopedic surgery with measured outcomes such as pain, analgesia consumption, length of hospital stay, and range of motion. Heterogeneity was identified in usage of osteopathic techniques, treatment duration, and occurrence, as well as in the treating osteopath's experience. CONCLUSION: Despite the small number of research articles within this field, both positive measured effects as well as the absence of such effects were identified. Overall, there was a heterogeneity concerning surgical contexts, diagnoses, signs and symptoms, as well as surgical phases in current interprofessional osteopathic publications. In this era of multimodal surgical care, we argue that there is an urgent need to evaluate OMT in this context of care and with a proper research approach.\n.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "pmid24353408": {"__data__": {"id_": "pmid24353408", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "pmid24353408: Title: High-grade glioma in elderly patients: can the oncogeriatrician help?\n Abstract: Gliomas are the most frequent primary brain tumors in adults.

It is caused by a novel bunyavirus infection (SFTSV). Since the first discovery of SFTSV, there have been case reports and epidemiological studies on SFTS in several East Asian countries, such as South Korea, Japan, Vietnam and so on. With the rising incidence of SFTS and the rapid spread of the novel bunyavirus around the world, it is clear that the virus has a pandemic potential and may pose a threat to global public health in the future. Early studies have suggested that ticks are an important medium for the transmission of SFTSV to humans; in recent years, it has been reported that there is also human-to-human transmission. In endemic areas, potential hosts include a variety of livestock and wildlife. When people are infected with SFTV, the main clinical manifestations are high fever, thrombocytopenia, leukocytopenia, gastrointestinal symptoms, liver and kidney function damage, and even MODS, with a mortality rate of about 10-30%.

Two interventions that have the potential to prevent progression of frailty and improve patient outcomes in hospitalised older adults but have yet to be subject to clinical trials are nurse-led volunteer support and technology-driven assessment of pain. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This single-centre, prospective, non-blinded, cluster randomised controlled trial will compare the efficacy of nurse-led volunteer support, technology-driven pain assessment and the combination of the two interventions to usual care for hospitalised older adults. Prior to commencing recruitment, the intervention and control conditions will be randomised across four wards. Recruitment will continue for 12 months. Data will be collected on admission, at discharge and at 30 days post discharge, with additional data collected during hospitalisation comprising records of pain assessment and volunteer support activity. The primary outcome of this study will be the change in frailty between both admission and discharge, and admission and 30 days, and secondary outcomes include length of stay, adverse events, discharge destination, quality of life, depression, cognitive function, functional independence, pain scores, pain management intervention (type and frequency) and unplanned 30-day readmissions. Stakeholder evaluation and an economic analysis of the interventions will also be conducted. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval has been granted by Human Research Ethics Committees at Ramsay Health Care WA SA (number: 2057) and Edith Cowan University (number: 2021-02210-SAUNDERS). The findings will be disseminated through conference presentations, peer-reviewed publications and social media.

Whereas many studies examine the risk of proximate exposures and comorbidities, little is known about pathways linking childhood exposures to later-life delirium. In this study, we explored the association between paternal occupation and delirium risk. Research Design and Methods: A prospective observational cohort study of 528 older adults undergoing elective surgery at two academic medical centers. Paternal occupation group (white collar vs. blue collar) served as our independent variable. Delirium incidence was assessed using the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) supplemented by medical chart review. Delirium severity was measured using the peak CAM-Severity score (CAM-S Peak), the highest value of CAM-S observed throughout the hospital stay. Results: Blue-collar paternal occupation was significantly associated with a higher rate of incident delirium (91/234, 39%) compared with white-collar paternal occupation (84/294, 29%), adjusted odds ratio OR (95% confidence interval [CI]) = 1.6 (1.1, 2.3). All analyses were adjusted for participant age, race, gender, and Charlson Comorbidity Index. Blue-collar paternal occupation was also associated with greater delirium severity, with a mean score (SD) of 4.4 (3.3), compared with white-collar paternal occupation with a mean score (SD) of 3.5 (2.8). Among participants reporting blue-collar paternal occupation, we observed an adjusted mean difference of 0.86 (95% CI = 0.4, 1.4) additional severity units. Discussion and Implications: Blue-collar paternal occupation is associated with greater delirium incidence and severity, after adjustment for covariates. These findings support the application of a life-course framework to evaluate the risk of later-life delirium and delirium severity. Our results also demonstrate the importance of considering childhood exposures, which may be consequential even decades later.\n.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "neurodegenerative conditions": {"__data__": {"id_": "neurodegenerative conditions", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "neurodegenerative conditions", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "trp 2,3 dioxygenase": {"__data__": {"id_": "trp 2,3 dioxygenase", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "trp 2,3 dioxygenase", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "heme": {"__data__": {"id_": "heme", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "heme", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "nitric oxide": {"__data__": {"id_": "nitric oxide", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "nitric oxide", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ifn gamma": {"__data__": {"id_": "ifn gamma", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "ifn gamma", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "pmid28469468": {"__data__": {"id_": "pmid28469468", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "pmid28469468: Title: Kynurenine Pathway of Tryptophan Metabolism: Regulatory and Functional Aspects.\n Abstract: Regulatory and functional aspects of the kynurenine (K) pathway (KP) of tryptophan (Trp) degradation are reviewed. The KP accounts for ~95% of dietary Trp degradation, of which 90% is attributed to the hepatic KP. During immune activation, the minor extrahepatic KP plays a more active role. The KP is rate-limited by its first enzyme, Trp 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO), in liver and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) elsewhere. TDO is regulated by glucocorticoid induction, substrate activation and stabilization by Trp, cofactor activation by heme, and end-product inhibition by reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate). IDO is regulated by IFN-gamma and other cytokines and by nitric oxide. The KP disposes of excess Trp, controls hepatic heme synthesis and Trp availability for cerebral serotonin synthesis, and produces immunoregulatory and neuroactive metabolites, the B3 \"vitamin\" nicotinic acid, and oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. Various KP enzymes are undermined in disease and are targeted for therapy of conditions ranging from immunological, neurological, and neurodegenerative conditions to cancer.\n.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "pmid31246603": {"__data__": {"id_": "pmid31246603", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "pmid31246603: Title: Prophylactic Haloperidol Effects on Long-term Quality of Life in Critically Ill Patients at High Risk for Delirium: Results of the REDUCE Study.\n Abstract: BACKGROUND: Delirium incidence in intensive care unit patients is high and associated with impaired long-term outcomes. The use of prophylactic haloperidol did not improve short-term outcome among critically ill adults at high risk of delirium. This study evaluated the effects of prophylactic haloperidol use on long-term quality of life in this group of patients and explored which factors are associated with change in quality of life. METHODS: A preplanned secondary analysis of long-term outcomes of the pRophylactic haloperidol usE for DeliriUm in iCu patients at high risk for dElirium (REDUCE) study was conducted. In this multicenter randomized clinical trial, nondelirious intensive care unit patients were assigned to prophylactic haloperidol (1 or 2 mg) or placebo (0.9% sodium chloride). In all groups, patients finally received study medication for median duration of 3 days [interquartile range, 2 to 6] until onset of delirium or until intensive care unit discharge. Long-term outcomes were assessed using the Short Form-12 questionnaire at intensive care unit admission (baseline) and after 1 and 6 months. Quality of life was summarized in the physical component summary and mental component summary scores. Differences between the haloperidol and placebo group and factors associated with changes in quality of life were analyzed. RESULTS: Of 1,789 study patients, 1,245 intensive care unit patients were approached, of which 887 (71%) responded. Long-term quality of life did not differ between the haloperidol and placebo group (physical component summary mean score of 39 +- 11 and 39 +- 11, respectively, and P = 0.350; and mental component summary score of 50 +- 10 and 51 +- 10, respectively, and P = 0.678). Age, medical and trauma admission, quality of life score at baseline, risk for delirium (PRE-DELIRIC) score, and the number of sedation-induced coma days were significantly associated with a decline in long-term quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: Prophylactic haloperidol use does not affect long-term quality of life in critically ill patients at high risk for delirium. Several factors, including the modifiable factor number of sedation-induced coma days, are associated with decline in long-term outcomes.\n.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "reduce": {"__data__": {"id_": "reduce", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "reduce", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "sodium chloride": {"__data__": {"id_": "sodium chloride", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "sodium chloride", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "pmid35025076": {"__data__": {"id_": "pmid35025076", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "pmid35025076: Title: Psychiatric Adverse Reactions to Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase Inhibitors in Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer: Analysis of Spontaneous Reports Submitted to the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System.\n Abstract: BACKGROUND: The development of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has improved the survival outcomes of patients with advanced ALK-rearranged non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The adverse events (AEs) related to ALK inhibitors are fairly well known; notably, about 20% of patients receiving lorlatinib experienced cognitive effects and behavioral alterations in pivotal trials. Therefore, psychiatric disorders could represent AEs of special interest for all ALK TKIs, deserving careful assessment in the post-marketing setting. OBJECTIVE: We conducted a real-world pharmacovigilance study on psychiatric AEs with marketed ALK inhibitors in subjects with advanced NSCLC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed an observational, retrospective analysis of spontaneous reports submitted to the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Events Reporting System (FAERS, as of December 2020), selecting psychiatric AEs to ALK TKIs approved in NSCLC (crizotinib, ceritinib, alectinib, brigatinib, lorlatinib). These AEs were independently scrutinized by three oncologists applying predefined exclusion criteria, described in terms of clinical/demographic features and assessed for drug-related causality according to an adaptation of the WHO-UMC system, a standardized probabilistic algorithm. RESULTS: Among 584 reported psychiatric AEs, 95 cases were selected as potentially treatment related, with higher reporting frequency for lorlatinib (26, 2.8%), followed by brigatinib (10, 1.2%), alectinib (18, 0.7%), ceritinib (12, 0.6%), and crizotinib (29, 0.3%). Reported psychiatric symptoms were mood disorders (39), psychotic disorders (24), and anxiety, agitation, and irritability (25). In the majority (74%) of cases, psychiatric AEs were serious and required hospitalization in about 32% of patients; 15.8% of retained cases were considered as highly probable and 69.5% as probable. Drug discontinuation was recorded in 31.6% of the reported cases, with the highest proportion for lorlatinib (65.4%). CONCLUSION: Notwithstanding limitations, our study found a higher proportion of psychiatric AEs with lorlatinib, but also raised the hypothesis of psychiatric reactions as a class effect of ALK TKIs.\n.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__":

withdrawal syndrome is very heterogeneous with more than 100 drug combinations. This results from differently qualified physicians and from insufficient pharmacostudies concerning evaluation and psychopathological methodology of the alcohol withdrawal syndrome. The following advices can be given: Physical withdrawal should take place under the conditions of an appropriate hospital with a qualified team. The application of electrolytes and vitamines (B1) may be necessary in alcohol addicts. Less severe alcohol withdrawal syndromes are treated sufficiently with carbamazepine, sometimes it can be necessary to combine it with neuroleptics or benzodiazepines. A secure prevention from delirium tremens and its treatment is only guaranteed by clomethiazole or benzodiazepines. To reduce the doses of those drugs, combinations with neuroleptics are possible. In general voluntary physical withdrawal proves only to be successful if longtime abstinence is planned and a motivation program is setup the for withdrawal treatment.\n.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "vitamines (b1)": {"__data__": {"id_": "vitamines (b1)", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "vitamines (b1)", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "carbamazepine": {"__data__": {"id_": "carbamazepine", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "carbamazepine", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "pmid33641757": {"__data__": {"id_": "pmid33641757", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "pmid33641757: Title: Cognitive Impairment in Older Adults and Oral Health Considerations: Treatment and Management.\n Abstract: Current research aims at improving early detection and treatment of cognitive impairment (CI), particularly in patients at high risk for progression to dementia.

Part II. Non-alkaloidal natural products.\n Abstract: Malaria is still the most destructive and dangerous parasitic infection in many tropical and subtropical countries. The burden of this disease is getting worse, mainly due to the increasing resistance of Plasmodium falciparum against the widely available antimalarial drugs. There is an urgent need for new, more affordable and accessible antimalarial agents possessing original modes of action. Natural products have played a dominant role in the discovery of leads for the development of drugs to treat human diseases, and this fact anticipates that new antimalarial leads may certainly emerge from tropical plant sources. This present review covers most of the recently-published non-alkaloidal natural compounds from plants with antiplasmodial and antimalarial properties, belonging to the classes of terpenes, limonoids, flavonoids, chromones, xanthones, anthraquinones, miscellaneous and related compounds, besides the majority of papers describing antiplasmodial crude extracts published in the last five years not reviewed before.

Delirium is associated with a number of adverse clinical and social outcomes with higher financial cost and risk of developing dementia, as well as increased likelihood of need for residential care. Current interventions for the prevention of delirium typically involve recognition and amelioration of modifiable risk factors and treatment of underlying conditions that predispose the individual to delirium. A number of pharmacological strategies for delirium prevention have been tested. Antipsychotic medications are used for treatment of agitation in the setting of delirium when other measures have failed, but their efficacy in prevention is limited by study heterogeneity and concerns about tolerability. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are effective in the symptomatic treatment of Alzheimer's disease but do not appear to be effective in preventing delirium. Melatonin and melatonin agonists have a rather benign side effect profile and show promise for prevention of delirium in medically unwell individuals. The alpha-2 agonist, dexmedetomidine may be helpful in the intensive care unit setting but intravenous route of administration and need for close clinical supervision limits its use in the wider hospital environment. Other agents such as benzodiazepines, corticosteroids, statins and gabapentin have been suggested but lack evidence to support their role in delirium prevention. To date, there is inconsistent and conflicting data regarding the efficacy of any particular pharmacological agent although some interventions do show promise. Larger, well-designed, placebo-controlled clinical trials are needed. \n.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "alpha 2": {"__data__": {"id_": "alpha 2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "alpha 2", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "gabapentin": {"__data__": {"id_": "gabapentin", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "gabapentin", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "melatonin": {"__data__": {"id_": "melatonin", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "melatonin", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "postoperative falls": {"__data__": {"id_": "postoperative falls", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "postoperative falls", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "pmid27599969": {"__data__": {"id_": "pmid27599969", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "pmid27599969: Title: Preoperative Falls Predict Postoperative Falls, Functional Decline, and Surgical Complications.\n Abstract: BACKGROUND: Falls are common and linked to morbidity. Our objectives were to characterize postoperative falls, and determine whether preoperative falls independently predicted postoperative falls (primary outcome), functional dependence, quality of life, complications, and readmission. METHODS: This prospective cohort study included 7982 unselected patients undergoing elective surgery. Data were collected from the medical record, a baseline survey, and follow-up surveys approximately 30days and one year after surgery. RESULTS: Fall rates (per 100 person-years) peaked at 175 (hospitalization), declined to 140 (30-day survey), and then to 97 (one-year survey). After controlling for confounders, a history of one, two, and >=three preoperative falls predicted postoperative falls at 30days (adjusted odds ratios [aOR] 2.3, 3.6, 5.5) and one year (aOR 2.3, 3.4, 6.9). One, two, and >=three falls predicted functional decline at 30days (aOR 1.2, 2.4, 2.4) and one year (aOR 1.3, 1.5, 3.2), along with in-hospital complications (aOR 1.2, 1.3, 2.0). Fall history predicted adverse outcomes better than commonly-used metrics, but did not predict quality of life deterioration or readmission. CONCLUSIONS: Falls are common after surgery, and preoperative falls herald postoperative falls and other adverse outcomes.

METHODS: By applying new BFCRS item score thresholds, symptoms were clustered into three categories to comprise the Research Diagnostic Criteria for Catatonia (RDCC): akinesia (criterion A), unusual motor signs (criterion B), and behavioral signs (criterion C). RDCC symptom clusters were analyzed in four prospectively evaluated patient groups (delirium, medical, affective, and psychosis) (N=341). RESULTS: Use of the RDCC, compared with the DSM-5-TR and BFCRS, resulted in far fewer diagnoses of catatonia in the four patient groups: medical, N=1 out of 42 (2%); affective, N=1 out of 45 (2%); psychosis, N=3 out of 53 (6%); and delirium, N=0 out of 201. Permutations of the RDCC with more relaxed criteria were assessed, requiring either symptom thresholds or numbers of symptoms to meet criteria, resulting in catatonia rate gradations between those obtained with the RDCC and those obtained with current systems. The Cochrane Q test found that the DSM-5-TR was not dissimilar to the RDCC, if fulfilling numerical thresholds for criteria A-C, although any level of symptom severity was allowed. Confirmatory factor analysis with three goodness-of-fit indexes validated the RDCC. CONCLUSIONS: The RDCC requires akinetic symptoms on the basis of literature demonstrating their high BFCRS prevalence and exploratory factor analysis co-loadings, plus symptoms from unusual motor and behavioral signs. Compared with current lenient diagnostic approaches, having the symptoms required by the RDCC produced lower catatonia rates in the psychosis, affective, and medical groups and revealed no patients with catatonia in the delirium group. Subdividing DSM-5-TR symptoms into several different criteria may improve diagnosis.

Thermoregulatory physiology sustains health by keeping body core temperature within a degree or two of 37 C, which enables normal cellular function. Heat production and dissipation are dependent on a coordinated set of autonomic responses. The clinical detection of thermoregulatory impairment provides important diagnostic and localizing information in the evaluation of disorders that impair thermoregulatory pathways, including autonomic neuropathies and ganglionopathies. Failure of neural thermoregulatory mechanisms or exposure to extreme or sustained temperatures that overwhelm the body's thermoregulatory capacity can also result in potentially life-threatening departures from normothermia. Hypothermia, defined as a core temperature of <35.0 C, may present with shivering, respiratory depression, cardiac dysrhythmias, impaired mental function, mydriasis, hypotension, and muscle dysfunction, which can progress to cardiac arrest or coma. Management includes warming measures, hydration, and cardiovascular support. Deaths from hypothermia are twice as frequent as deaths from hyperthermia. Hyperthermia, defined as a core temperature of >40.5 C, may present with sweating, flushing, tachycardia, fatigue, lightheadedness, headache, and paresthesia, progressing to weakness, muscle cramps, oliguria, nausea, agitation, hypotension, syncope, confusion, delirium, seizures, and coma. Mental status changes and core temperature distinguish potentially fatal heat stroke from heat exhaustion. Management requires the immediate reduction of core temperature. Ice water immersion has been shown to be superior to alternative cooling measures. Avoidance of thermal risk and early recognition of cold or heat stress are the cornerstones of preventive therapy.\n.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null,

geriatric syndromes in community-dwelling older adults in China.\n Abstract: This study aims to assess the prevalence of geriatric syndromes and identify factors associated with multiple geriatric syndromes in community-dwelling older adults in China. We utilized a convenience sampling method to recruit older adults and from one rural and one urban community in Chengdu, China, from October 2022 to March 2023. A total of 706 older adults aged 60 years or older were included. Ten geriatric syndromes were investigated including two mental disorders: depressive symptoms, cognitive impairment; and eight somatic disorders: pain, falls, sleep disturbance, constipation, polypharmacy, multimorbidity, malnutrition and frailty. Multiple geriatric syndromes were defined as an individual having two or more geriatric syndromes. The data obtained were analysed using descriptive statistics. The independent risk factors for multiple geriatric syndromes were assessed using a logistic regression model. This study found that 90.5% of the participants had at least one geriatric syndrome, with 72.8% experiencing multiple geriatric syndromes. The top four geriatric syndromes in our study were polypharmacy (58.5%), malnutrition/at risk of malnutrition (43.1%), multimorbidity (42.1%), and frailty/prefrailty (34.3%). Of the older adults, 368(52.1%) had only somatic disorders, 18(2.5%) had only mental disorders and 253 (35.8%) had somatic-mental disorders. According to the logistic regression analysis, residence, age, marriage, BMI, and self-related health were significantly associated with multiple geriatric syndromes among older adults. This study highlights that multiple geriatric syndromes are prevalent among community-dwelling older adults in China, and underscores the significance of certain demographic factors in their occurrence. Future longitudinal studies are needed to establish the temporal relationship between multiple geriatric syndromes and these demographic factors, as well as to explore causal relationships and effective prevention strategies for geriatric syndrome.\n.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "somatic mental disorders": {"__data__": {"id_": "somatic mental disorders", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "somatic mental disorders", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "depressive symptoms": {"__data__": {"id_": "depressive symptoms", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "depressive symptoms", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "pmid33281313": {"__data__": {"id_": "pmid33281313", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "pmid33281313: Title: Evidence-based National Consensus: Recommendations for Physiotherapy Management in COVID-19 in Acute Care Indian Setup.\n Abstract: BACKGROUND: With the Wuhan pandemic spread to India, more than lakhs of population were affected with COVID-19 with varying severities. Physiotherapists participated as frontline workers to contribute to management of patients in COVID-19 in reducing morbidity of these patients and aiding them to road to recovery.

Others have shown an association between delirium and increased mortality, length of hospitalization, cost, and discharge to extended stay facilities. Until recently it was not known that after an episode of delirium in elderly, there is a 63% probability of developing dementia at 48 months compared to 8% in patients without delirium. Currently there are no preventive therapies for delirium, thus elucidation of cellular and molecular underpinnings of this condition may lead to the development of early interventions and thus prevent permanent cognitive damage. In this article we make the case for the role of glia in the pathophysiology of delirium and describe an astrocyte-dependent central and peripheral cholinergic anti-inflammatory shield which may be disabled by astrocytic pathology, leading to neuroinflammation and delirium. We also touch on the role of glia in information processing and neuroimaging. \n.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cognitive damage": {"__data__": {"id_": "cognitive damage", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "cognitive damage", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "pmid34804189": {"__data__": {"id_": "pmid34804189", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "pmid34804189: Title: Virtual system for early detection of COVID-19 infection \"Etaware-CDT-2020 prototype design\" (corroborated by rRT-PCR data).\n Abstract: The 2nd phase of COVID-19 infection outbreak experienced worldwide is an attestation to the decline in the efficiency of COVID-19 detection kits available worldwide. rRT-PCR still remains the best confirmatory test for COVID-19 infection. Sadly, most medical professionals are not conversant with the rRT-PCR protocols. Therefore, more easy-to-use alternatives are required as backup, to compensate for these lapses. \"Etaware-CDT-2020\" is a virtual system designed for early detection of COVID-19 infection. A comparative COVID-19 diagnosis was conducted using Etaware-CDT-2020, corroborated by rRT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 results obtained from China (Latitude 35.8617oN and Longitude 104.1954oE), which was the epicentre for COVID-19 infection outbreak. A cross-comparison of results showed that there was a positive correlation between the output result from Etaware-CDT-2020 and rRT-PCR diagnosis from Wuhan (r = 0.92) and Hubei (r = 0.97). Furthermore, there was no significant difference between the diagnostic results of \"Etaware-CDT-2020\" and rRT-PCR, when compared by T-test (P(t = 0) > 0.05) and Pearson's Chi-Square test (0.04 >= P <= 0.12). Etaware-CDT-2020 is unique and can be used anywhere, anytime and by anyone.

While it is widely accepted that elderly patients may experience POCD following anesthesia/surgery, the exact mechanism behind this phenomenon remains unclear. Several studies have indicated that the interaction between silent mating type information regulation 2 homologue 1 (SIRT1) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is crucial in controlling cognitive function and is strongly linked to neurodegenerative disorders. Hence, this research aims to explore how SIRT1/BDNF impacts cognitive decline caused by anesthesia/surgery in aged mice. METHODS: Open field test (OFT) was used to determine whether anesthesia/surgery affected the motor ability of mice, while the postoperative cognitive function of 18 months old mice was evaluated with Novel object recognition test (NORT), Object location test (OLT) and Fear condition test (FC). The expressions of SIRT1 and other molecules were analyzed by western blot and immunofluorescence staining. The hippocampal synaptic plasticity was detected by Golgi staining and Long-term potentiation (LTP). The effects of SIRT1 and BDNF overexpression as well as chemogenetic activation of glutamatergic neurons in hippocampal CA1 region of 18 months old vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGLUT1) mice on POCD were further investigated. RESULTS: The research results revealed that older mice exhibited cognitive impairment following intramedullary fixation of tibial fracture. Additionally, a notable decrease in the expression of SIRT1/BDNF and neuronal excitability in hippocampal CA1 glutamatergic neurons was observed. By increasing levels of SIRT1/BDNF or enhancing glutamatergic neuron excitability in the CA1 region, it was possible to effectively mitigate synaptic plasticity impairment and ameliorate postoperative cognitive dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: The decline in SIRT1/BDNF levels leading to changes in synaptic plasticity and neuronal excitability in older mice could be a significant factor contributing to cognitive impairment after anesthesia/surgery.\n.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "brain derived neurotrophic factor": {"__data__": {"id_": "brain derived neurotrophic factor", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "brain derived neurotrophic factor", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "vesicular glutamate transporter 1": {"__data__": {"id_": "vesicular glutamate transporter 1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "vesicular glutamate transporter 1", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "neurofilament light chain": {"__data__": {"id_": "neurofilament light chain", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "neurofilament light chain", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "inflammation": {"__data__": {"id_": "inflammation", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "inflammation", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "pmid36409557": {"__data__": {"id_": "pmid36409557", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "pmid36409557: Title: Cerebrospinal fluid quinolinic acid is strongly associated with delirium and mortality in hip-fracture patients.\n Abstract: BACKGROUNDThe kynurenine pathway (KP) has been identified as a potential mediator linking acute illness to cognitive dysfunction by generating neuroactive metabolites in response to inflammation. Delirium (acute confusion) is a common complication of acute illness and is associated with increased risk of dementia and mortality. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying delirium, particularly in relation to the KP, remain elusive.METHODSWe undertook a multicenter observational study with 586 hospitalized patients (248 with delirium) and investigated associations between delirium and KP metabolites measured in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum by targeted metabolomics. We also explored associations between KP metabolites and markers of neuronal damage and 1-year mortality.RESULTSIn delirium, we found concentrations of the neurotoxic metabolite quinolinic acid in CSF (CSF-QA) (OR 2.26 [1.78, 2.87], P < 0.001) to be increased and also found increases in several other KP metabolites in serum and CSF. In addition, CSF-QA was associated with the neuronal damage marker neurofilament light chain (NfL) (beta 0.43, P < 0.001) and was a strong predictor of 1-year mortality (HR 4.35 [2.93, 6.45] for CSF-QA >= 100 nmol/L, P < 0.001). The associations between CSF-QA and delirium, neuronal damage, and mortality remained highly significant following adjustment for confounders and multiple comparisons.CONCLUSIONOur data identified how systemic inflammation, neurotoxicity, and delirium are strongly linked via the KP and should inform future delirium prevention and treatment clinical trials that target enzymes of the KP.FUNDINGNorwegian Health Association and South-Eastern Norway Regional Health Authorities.\n.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "quinolinic acid": {"__data__": {"id_": "quinolinic acid", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "quinolinic acid", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "hypoactive delirium": {"__data__": {"id_": "hypoactive delirium", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "hypoactive delirium", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "pmid36982655": {"__data__": {"id_": "pmid36982655", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "pmid36982655: Title: Altered Tryptophan-Kynurenine Pathway in Delirium: A Review of the Current Literature.\n Abstract: Delirium, a common form of acute brain dysfunction, is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, especially in older patients. The underlying pathophysiology of delirium is not clearly understood, but acute systemic inflammation is known to drive delirium in cases of acute illnesses, such as sepsis, trauma, and surgery. Based on psychomotor presentations, delirium has three main subtypes, such as hypoactive, hyperactive, and mixed subtype. There are similarities in the initial presentation of delirium with depression and dementia, especially in the hypoactive subtype. Hence, patients with hypoactive delirium are frequently misdiagnosed. The altered kynurenine pathway (KP) is a promising molecular pathway implicated in the pathogenesis of delirium. The KP is highly regulated in the immune system and influences neurological functions. The activation of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, and specific KP neuroactive metabolites, such as quinolinic acid and kynurenic acid, could play a role in the event of delirium. Here, we collectively describe the roles of the KP and speculate on its relevance in delirium.\n.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "metadata_seperator": "\n",
