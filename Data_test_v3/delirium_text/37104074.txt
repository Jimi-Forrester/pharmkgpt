37104074|t|Antimicrobial Stewardship and Dose Adjustment of Restricted Antimicrobial Drugs in Hospital Setting.
37104074|a|Antimicrobial consumption is increasing. In order to maximize the effectiveness of antimicrobial stewardship and provide safe and optimal use of restricted antimicrobial drugs, renal dosing should be evaluated. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of restricted antimicrobial drugs that required dose adjustment according to renal function. A retrospective, consecutive study was conducted at University Hospital Dubrava. This study analyzed requests for restricted antimicrobial drugs (n = 2890) during a 3-month period. Requests for antimicrobial agents were evaluated by the antimicrobial therapy management team (A-team). This study included 412 restricted antimicrobial drug requests requiring dose adjustment, of which 39.1% did not have an adjusted dose. Meropenem, Ciprofloxacin, Piperacillin/Tazobactam, Vancomycin, Colistin and the antimycotic Fluconazole were the most frequent restricted antimicrobial drugs that required dose adjustment according to impaired renal function. The results of this research highlight the importance of the A-team in the optimization of restricted antimicrobial therapy. Non-adjusted doses of restricted antimicrobial drugs increase the possibility of adverse drug reactions and therefore jeopardize pharmacotherapy outcomes and patient safety.
