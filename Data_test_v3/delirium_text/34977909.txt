34977909|t|Neuropsychiatric presentation of Covid-19-related encephalitis: Case report.
34977909|a|Covid-19-related encephalitis is a heterogeneous syndrome characterized by a combination of clinical, laboratory, and imaging features related to inflammation of the brain, where the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is presumably the causative agent. We reported a case of Covid-19-related encephalitis presenting with neuropsychiatric symptoms, including intense agitation. Reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction in cerebrospinal fluid was positive for SARS-CoV-2. Our case expands the literature about neurologic manifestations of Covid-19 and emphasizes the possibility of prominent behavioral symptoms as the initial manifestation.
