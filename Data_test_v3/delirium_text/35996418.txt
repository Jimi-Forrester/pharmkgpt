35996418|t|Evidence of White Matter Integrity Changes in the Anterior Cingulum Among Shift Workers: A Cross-Sectional Study.
35996418|a|Introduction: We investigated the white matter integrity in shift and non-shift workers and its associations with sleep and activity. Methods: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was performed on 61 shift workers and 31 non-shift workers. Their sleep and activity profiles were assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), sleep diaries, and actigraphy. Fractional anisotropy (FA) (a measure of white matter integrity) was calculated using DTI tractography. Results: Shift workers exhibited higher FA values in the bilateral anterior cingulum than did non-shift workers. An increased FA in the right anterior cingulum was correlated with poor sleep quality (ie, a high PSQI score) in shift workers. An increased FA in the right anterior cingulum was also correlated with higher actigraphic activity indices (the mesor and M10 indices) in shift workers. Discussion: The white matter integrity of the anterior cingulum was altered in shift workers, perhaps in association with sleep and activity disturbances.
