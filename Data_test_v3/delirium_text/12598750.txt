12598750|a|Our objective was to assess the complications of laparoscopic fundoplication in 77 patients older than 70 years of age. The indications for surgery were (1) complications of reflux esophagitis (n = 17), (2) large hiatal hernia (n = 10), (3) asthma and bronchitis (n = 7), (4) the need for other surgery (n = 13), and (5) a patient's desire to discontinue medical treatment that was controlling reflux esophagitis (n = 30). Operative time varied from 34 to 250 minutes (mean [standard deviation], 116 +/- 20). Hospital stay varied from 12 hours to 19 days (mean, 1.2). No patient needed conversion to open operation. Intraoperative complications were observed in 4 patients (5.2%): left pneumothorax in 2, major operative bleeding in 1, and minor spleen lesion in 1. The most common postoperative complications were gas-bloating syndrome and dysphagia. Gastric ulcer was diagnosed in two. Other postoperative complications included acute delirium, acute urinary retention, and acute ischemia of the lower extremity. One patient died of congestive heart failure. It is concluded that laparoscopic fundoplication is an effective procedure for treating geriatric patients with reflux esophagitis and may be performed with low morbidity and mortality rates.
