39615537|t|Using Compressed Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy for an Adult Critical Illness Survivor: A Case Report.
39615537|a|INTRODUCTION: Nearly one-quarter of adult critical illness survivors develop posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms triggered by sensory stimuli after intensive care unit discharge. Intensive care unit delirium is a risk factor for posttraumatic stress disorder. Compressed virtual reality exposure therapy (C-VRET) incorporates sensory stimuli to reduce posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms through habituation. CLINICAL FINDINGS AND DIAGNOSIS: A critical illness survivor developed intensive care unit delirium and enrolled in a C-VRET trial to treat posttraumatic stress disorder. She reported self-isolation because of infection fears and posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms triggered by medical commercials and lawn equipment sounds. She repetitively checked her heart rate at night for fear of missing illness signs and waking up intubated. INTERVENTIONS: The participant completed therapy. Screening tests were administered before, 2 weeks after, and 3 months after therapy to measure posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms (Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5; range, 0-60), depression (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale; range, 0-60), physical activity (International Physical Activity Questionnaire), and resiliency (Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale; range, 0-100). OUTCOMES: The participant's posttraumatic stress disorder symptom scores declined from 36 to 11 to 5; depression scores declined from 19 to 5 to 1; physical activity scores increased from 499 to 2013 to 4599; and resiliency scores increased from 70 to 76 to 83. CONCLUSION: This report highlights the severity of posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms in critical illness survivors and the importance of strategies to limit delirium and posttraumatic stress disorder. Compressed virtual reality exposure therapy may reduce posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms in critical illness survivors.
