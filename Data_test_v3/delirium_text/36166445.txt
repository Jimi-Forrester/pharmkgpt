Despite early mortality seeming alarming, data regarding factors that lead to increased early mortality of COVID 19 patients is not well-documented yet. The objective of this study was to identify the risk factors of early mortality in patients with confirmed COVID-19 infections. METHODOLOGY: A case-control study design was employed. With this, a total of 261 COVID-19 deceased recordings were reviewed. The cases of the study were recordings of patients deceased within three days of intensive care unit admission whereas, the rest 187 were recordings of patients who died after three days of admission. Data were collected using an extraction checklist, entered into Epi data version 4.4.2.2, and analyzed by SPSS version 25. After the description, binary logistic regression was run to conduct bivariate and multivariable analyses. Finally, statistical significance was declared at p-value <0.05, and an adjusted odds ratio with a 95% confidence interval was used to report the strength of association. RESULT: The analysis was performed on 261 (87 cases and 174 controls) recordings. About 62.5% of the participants were aged above 65 years and two-thirds were males. The presence of cardiovascular disease (AOR = 4.79, with 95%CI: 1.73, 13.27) and bronchial-asthma (AOR = 6.57; 95% CI: 1.39, 31.13) were found to have a statistically significant association with early mortality. The existence of complications from COVID-19 (AOR = 0.22; 95% CI: 0.07, 0.74) and previous history of COVID-19 infection (AOR = 0.17, 95% CI: 0.04, 0.69) were associated with decreased risk of early mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Having cardiovascular diseases and bronchial asthma was associated with an increased risk of early mortality. Conversely, the presence of intensive care unit complications and previous history of COVID-19 infection were associated with decreased risk of early mortality.
