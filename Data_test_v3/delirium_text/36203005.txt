36203005|t|Patient-reported cognitive function among hematopoietic stem cell transplant and cellular therapy patients: a scoping review.
36203005|a|PURPOSE: Cognitive dysfunction is a known complication following cellular therapies (CT), which can be assessed through performance based and patient-reported measures. We performed a systematic scoping review to assess self-reported cognitive function measures used among adult CT patients and describe long-term results, including associations with clinical outcomes. METHODS: Library databases were searched from inception to February 2020 according to PRISMA guidelines. Additional studies were identified through reference lists and trial protocols. Two members of the research team screened titles and abstracts and resolved discrepancies. Articles that met eligibility criteria continued to full-text review, with 25% double screening. Articles were removed if they (1) were not original research, peer-reviewed articles; (2) were the wrong disease, age, or treatment-specific patient population; (3) did not use patient-reported outcomes; (4) did not separately report cognitive function outcomes. RESULTS: Of the1952 articles, 56 were included. Twenty-one patient-reported measures of cognitive function were used; most frequently the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC-QLQ-C30), which includes a two-item cognitive function subscale (57%; n = 32). Thirteen studies collected performance-based and self-reported measures and of those (n = 6) who assessed associations found moderate correlations (range r = .13-.58). Longitudinal patterns showed declines in cognitive function soon after treatment (< 1 month) returning to baseline at 1 year. Cognitive function was often associated with other quality of life measures, chiefly depression (n = 5). CONCLUSIONS: EORTC-QLQ-C30 is the most commonly used to measure, though there remain numerous measures used, including several measures with little previous validation and investigator developed items.
