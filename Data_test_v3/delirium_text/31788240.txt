31788240|t|Management protocols and encountered complications among stroke patients admitted to stroke unit of Jimma university medical center, Southwest Ethiopia: Prospective observational study.
31788240|a|OBJECTIVES: The number of stroke patients receiving recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (r-tPA) in developing world is extremely low. Pre-hospital delay, financial constraints and lack of infrastructure are the main barriers. Additionally, various medical, neurological and psychological complications are allied to stroke patients after the acute attack. Hence, the study was aimed to identify management protocols and encountered complications among stroke patients admitted to stroke unit of Jimma university medical center (JUMC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Prospective observational study was conducted at stroke unit of JUMC from March 10 to July 10, 2017. All eligible consecutive stroke patients of >=18 years were included. Data was entered to Epi data version 3.1 and analyzed using SPSS version 20. RESULTS: A total of 116 eligible stroke patients were followed with mean age of 55.14 +- 14.04 years and males comprised of 62.9%. Using world health organization (WHO) criteria, 60 (51.7%) patients had ischemic while 56 (48.3%) had hemorrhagic stroke. During admission, 93 (80.2%) patients had developed at least one complication. The most complication was brain edema (increased intracranial pressure) detected in about one third of the patients (30.2%) followed by urinary incontinence (28.4%) and aspiration pneumonia (19.8%). Almost half of the patients (52.5%) had at least one past medication history. During hospitalization, 111(95.7%) of patients had received at least one medication and the median start time of the medications after hospital arrival was 15 h. The most common medication given for the patients during hospitalization were antiplatelets and statins for 63 (54.3%) patients. During discharge, about 78 (67.2%) patients had received medications and antihypertensives were the prominent medications prescribed for half of the discharged patients. CONCLUSION: Both neurologic and medical complications were common in majority of stroke patients. But the management protocol for stroke patients was sub-optimal and lagging behind the recommended guidelines due to lack of skilled personnel, appropriate treatment and diagnostic agents. The clinical team involved in the care of stroke patients should make preparations to take preventive measures that will save a lot of lives.
