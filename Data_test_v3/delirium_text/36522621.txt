36522621|a|BACKGROUND: Neuronal Intranuclear Inclusion Disease (NIID) is a degenerative disease with heterogeneous clinical manifestations. We aim to analysis the relationship between clinical manifestations, neuroimaging and skin pathology in a Chinese NIID cohort. METHODS: Patients were recruited from a Chinese cohort. Detail clinical information were collected. Visual rating scale was used for evaluation of neuroimaging. The relationship between clinical presentations and neuroimaging, as well as skin pathology was statistically analyzed. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients were recruited. The average onset age was 54.3 y/o. 28.1% had positive family history. Dementia, autonomic nervous system dysfunction, episodic attacks were three main presentations. CSF analysis including Abeta42 and tau level was almost normal. The most frequently involved on MRI was periventricular white matter (100%), frontal subcortical and deep white matter (96.6%), corpus callosum (93.1%) and external capsule (72.4%). Corticomedullary junction DWI high intensity was found in 87.1% patients. Frontal and external capsule DWI high intensity connected to form a "kite-like" specific image. Severity of dementia was significantly related to leukoencephalopathy (r = 0.465, p = 0.0254), but not cortical atrophy and ventricular enlargement. Grey matter lesions were significantly associated with encephalopathy like attacks (p = 0.00077) but not stroke like attacks. The density of intranuclear inclusions in skin biopsy was not associated with disease duration, severity of leukoencephalopathy and dementia. CONCLUSIONS: Specific distribution of leukoencephalopathy and DWI high intensity were indicative. Leukoencephalopathy and subcortical mechanism were critical in pathogenesis of NIID. Irrelevant of inclusion density and clinical map suggested the direct pathogenic factor need further investigation.
