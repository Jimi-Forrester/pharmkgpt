This interaction may contribute to galantamine’s effectiveness in neurological and psychiatric disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease. Furthermore, galantamine can protect cells against amyloid beta-induced apoptosis by preventing mitochondrial dysfunction and endoplasmic reticulum stress, and it also appears to enhance autophagy by activating the JNK signaling pathway and inhibiting the Akt pathway. Importantly, alpha7nAChR interacts with the autophagosomal marker LC3, suggesting a role as a cargo carrier for Abeta1-42 sequestration to autophagosomes.",

For example, beta-asarone exhibits neuroprotective effects by modulating the P13K/Akt/Nrf2 signaling pathway, reducing oxidative stress and neuronal damage. Similarly, saikosaponin-D has been shown to enhance cellular antioxidant capacity and induce endogenous antioxidant enzyme activities through activation of PI3K and subsequent Nrf2 nuclear translocation, protecting cells from oxidative cytotoxicity. These findings suggest a potential therapeutic role for compounds with antioxidant properties and Nrf2 pathway activation in Alzheimer's disease.",

This indicates that the -308A allele (and therefore the A allele) is associated with earlier onset, and this association is stronger in individuals with the APOE epsilon4 allele. While the question asks which allele *increases* risk, the context consistently points to the A allele as a modifier of risk in the context of the APOE epsilon4 allele.
